I would imagine you could probably do a good business if you opened it 2 o'clock in the morning just kidding. Good maybe 5 o'clock and be nice but I'm kind of an early riser but anyway I always love going up there for breakfast keep up the good work",

Being a Irish white guy with latin tastebuds Scramble was the perfect place for me. If you crave breakfast burritos and you're not in San Diego I would recommend Scramble.   Multiple options for bb's ranging from chorizo with jalapeno sour cream to your basic gringo bacon and egg bb. I also love how they will happily adjust your order to your liking. If you want egg whites or crispy potatoes they will accommodate all of your requests.   Seating doesn't seem to be a problem even on a Sunday morning. 12:00pm is still morning for me on Sunday btw.",

Now don't get me wrong the line was pretty quick and the Martinelli Apple Juice rocked. I got the 3 Cheese Omelet with cheddar, jack and herb cheese it was ok, can't go wrong with cheeses right. I also had hashbrowns that were pretty tasty they could have been better if they were completely done. Instead of the tell I was able to opt out for 3 silver dollar pancakes they're on the same level as IHOP thick and lacking flavor the syrup nothing special at all I've had better at McDonalds. Oh yeah I almost forgot to mention my turkey bacon Oh maybe because they forgot to send it out with my order and when I did remind them and it finally arrived it was time for me to go.",

It looked as if they had turned over the whole place for the drive, even offered a 2 for 1meal  ticket for people who made canned goods donations. I always feel rushed when you have to order at the cashier station but the gal who took the orders was patient and very nice.  I order the mushroom, bacon and jack cheese omelette, it was presented nicely with rosemary potatoes and toast. Toast was burned but replaced quickly. My mister ordered a BLT with Applewood bacon on a fresh baquette. Standard fare, but  well done.  American coffee was excellent. How great that I could get breakfast at noon.  Looking at the printed menu, I see I am coming back for the french toast and will try the vegan breakfast. I also like that they use local markets and farmers.   It was very clean and the patio looked inviting.",

I was there on Saturday around 9:00am and there were close to 30 people in line but only a single cash register open. Most of the seats were still available inside but the management only had a single person taking orders and a bunch of staff waiting around. Either they don't know their business or they have trouble running a business since they happens repeatedly.  My other beef with them are the hugely uncomfortable metal chairs that are inside. My god, these are the most uncomfortable chairs that I have ever sat in! While they look nice, they were clearly bought by a short person with an ample sized rear end. For everyone else, the chairs are agony to sit in. I suspect that these chairs were bought to make sure that people didn't linger but they are hugely uncomfortable.",

The pancakes were very undercooked. The coffee was watery. The scramble tasted like someone dumped an entire pepper shaker on it. The toast was dry. The sweet potato hash was tasteless and mushy. The tea was boring. Food was way too expensive. SAVE YOUR MONEY AND DON'T GO HERE!!! The only good part of the whole meal was that the manager refunded half our bill and gave us a coupon for two free entrees.",

Look at menu, walk to counter, order and pay, find a place to sit  So it was a lil awkward at first because I'm trying to skim through the menu quickly to order and not stand there like I'm looking at Xmas lights  So went for the two eggs ur way with toast hashbrowns, bacon, dollar sized multi grain pancakes, and French toast.  All but hashbrowns were good. I wish they had country potatoes as an option. Hashbrowns had an oily aftertaste to them.  All in all would comeback ...loved d French toast but next time would educate myself w the menu so I can order right away  Dress code: casual",

It's setup very familiar to a Pei Wei almost where you have your menu off to the side of the queue and approach the counter to order before taking a number and your seat.  The establishment was very clean and well lit as well as having a pretty nice quiet atmosphere.  I think it was like a Wednesday morning if my memory serves me right.  I ordered the French Toast and a Martinelli's Applejuice from the quite attractive young lady that was working the register.  I took my number to a table that was half seats half bench and my friends shortly followed suit.  A random conversation about iPads later and out food had arrived.  The French Toast was actually Baguettes that had been Frenchtoastified and they were delicious.  I also got some rosemary potatoes which were a little too rosemary for my taste, and s couple pieces of cherrywood smoked bacon.    Now if you've read any of my previous reviews you might have gathered that I'm rather picky about bacon.  This stuff however was amazing.  Thickly cut and perfectly crisp without being hard or chewy.  I'd definitely say that I'd take Cherrywood smoked bacon over Applewood any day of the week.  Prices were good, I think it came out to like 15 after tip.  Overall if I am able to drag myself outta bed early enough again I'd definitely take another visit.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this place. I love breakfast so a place with the meal in the name surely would be good at it, right? My experience was mostly good. Service was slow, as noted in the other reviews. They don't seem to know how to do two eggs over medium as mine had runny white. This was especially annoying to me since they have a poster by the cash register plainly describing what each egg style meant, and \"over medium\" doesn't mean runny whites. Once they fixed that on my order, the food was decent. I love that they're dog friendly - they even offered a water bowl for ours. If you're new to this place, be prepared to feel like a noob as you try to figure out the coffee area. I suppose after a few visits, we too can look down on the newbies who don't know how the island area works. Overall, I like this place and will be giving it another try, even though the prices are a little higher than diners.",

The bacon is very thick which is a great change compared to all the greasy spoon breakfast joints. The oatmeal is good and hugely proportioned. The french toast is yummy as are the simple breakfast meals. The red potatoes are great!! It has a vegan menu as well. I usually get the iced teas they have on the counter which I think are great! The service is always great and I haven't really had any disappointing visits, can't wait to come back!",

I love their breakfast burritos because their hearty and flavorful unlike the run of the mill kind at other places. I've also gotten the breakfast pizza and a turkey club. Both were good, but the Costa breakfast burrito is still my favorite. The ambience is so relaxing and the staff is always friendly. Only problem that took a whole star off is the price. Being a broke college kid, I wish they had some items that were a bit more affordable. But nonetheless, I still love this place. Definitely a great place to stop after hiking North Mountain.",

I didn't feel that way at all after eating at Scramble.  I had an excellent veggie scramble  with good sourdough toast.  The coffee was a strong, dark roast that I enjoyed, though a little too strong for me to love it.  There's free WiFi and a cheerful atmosphere.  It's casual dining (order at the counter, food brought to your table).  I wish there was a Scramble close to my home in California.  If there were, I'd go there often.",

    "text": "We were looking for something light, quick and good before hitting up the Phoenix Zoo and my sister had the perfect suggestion: Scramble.  She said there wouldn't be a wait--unlike most breakfast places on a Saturday morning. I was a bit puzzled when we pulled up and the line was out the door--my sis explained that it wasn't a line to be seated, but a line to order. Scramble is different than any other breakfast place/diner I'd every been to in that you place your order; pay; grab a seat; and then they bring your food out to you. After about 10-minutes we got up to the cashier and placed our order.  Santa Fe Eggs Benedict- The two perfectly poached eggs come with Ham, Chipotle Hollandaise sauce and Jalapeno Cornbread instead of the typical English Muffin. I can't describe how good and innovative this dish is--exactly the kind of thing I was looking for in my trip; the perfect breakfast. 5*  Toluca Brizza- If I thought my Santa Fe Benedict was innovative, then my wife's Toluca Brizza pushed the limits. The Brizza is a Breakfast Pizza, and I can't believe I've never seen this before. The Toluca comes with Chorizo, Eggs, Monterey Jack, Bell Peppers and  topped with a Jalapeno Cream Cheese. It's delicious, packed with toppings and big enough to share. My only complaint was the dough was a bit too dry for my liking but that's just a minor gripe. 4.75*  Service & Ambiance- Upon first arriving we were greeted by a manager at the back of the line, and again when we left; he was super-friendly and asked intelligent questions about our experience. The service inside was good, quick and efficient. Scramble is very clean and modern looking. They have lots of TVs broadcasting different channels; I'd advise that you pick a spot to sit where there's something on you want to watch. 4*  Value- Scramble is a great value with an average of $10/person with a beverage (e.g., coffee, OJ, etc); otherwise each plate is around $8.  Scramble is very avant-garde in that they don't do breakfast in the typical way with the same old ingredients. I'm always looking for something different and progressive in a restaurant and Scramble is definitely that. I wish them luck and I sincerely hope that the Phoenicians who visit really appreciate what they have. As for me I can only hope that something like this pops up close to home, but in the meantime I'll be sure to visit whenever I'm in town. I give Scramble a huge thumbs up!",

This time around the staff were great! Very polite! This place is clean and there's multiple items on the menu for different tastes and preferences... For the health conscious eaters as well.   We had the steak and eggs with wheat toast. We also ordered the silver dollar pancakes and an order of the junior French toast. This was a good option since we didn't want a whole order.   The steak and eggs were good! But the most amazing was the French toast!  Next time we'll steer away from the pancakes... Not sure if this is their best item... But everything else was good!   On weekends go EARLY or Later! Long lines! But they have a greeter at the door that makes sure not everyone is jammed in the entry way... Converse well with customers and made the wait go by very fast!  The line moves pretty quickly though!",

It is worth the trip for the Brizza (breakfast pizza) but otherwise the food is routine.    I've never had a bad meal, but I've also never had anything all that special.  The Phoenix Omelet I ordered on our most recent trip was supposed to have green chili; I didn't see or taste any.  There did seem to be very mildly spiced chorizo in the omelet, as advertized, but the \"pico de gallo\" on top was nothing but chopped tomatoes.    My biggest complaint is the price.  $5.69 for oatmeal?  Come on!  We spent $35 for two people earlier this week.  For that, we got oatmeal, 1 coffee, 2 ojs, an omelet, and 2 eggs with bacon.  Given that one has to stand in line to place your order, get your own silverware, and pour your own coffee, that seems ridiculous to me.  I will go back periodically for the ambience, which for some reason I like, and because it's one of the closest breakfast joints to where I live, but I will grumble each time I pay the bill.",

    "text": "With so many choices for a good breakfast, it can be kind of hard to stand apart. Bright, urban, funky and cool Scramble is a breath of fresh air to the breakfast scene.  The concept is great -- order and pay at the counter, then you're issued a number, take a seat in the dining space, then relax and wait for the food to arrive. Or choose to sit outdoors on the patio that is also dog-friendly.  Judging by several quotations of egg humor painted along the walls of the restaurant, Scramble doesn't take itself too seriously. But one slogan on the menu hits close to home: \"We're local and so are our ingredients.\" Locally sourced ingredients hits high marks when local businesses need our support.  There are so many tastily described items on the menu that being decisive first thing in the morning is difficult. A case filled with Cinnamon Rolls ($3) may help in the decision-making process. I've met many a cinnamon roll, but I've never encountered one like Scramble's. The addition of lemon juice to the frosting distinguishes what would have already been a deliciously tender and gooey roll. It took everything in my power not to order a six-pack to go ($16).  When I scan a menu I try to find the most unique item. At Scramble, one of those standouts is the Brizza ($8). The unlikely combination of two words -- breakfast and pizza -- make for a creative selection. Smoked Gouda and Cherrywood Bacon atop a tender thin crust are well paired, and there wasn't a bite left on the plate. If the spicy kick of the chorizo with peppers and jalapeno cream cheese version doesn't wake you up, then be sure to add a cup of Bold Bottomless Coffee ($2.25).  French French Toast ($6.50) takes thick slices of French baguette, dipped into vanilla custard then cooked on a griddle. The slabs of baguette were tender and had a certain creaminess that made dunking into the maple syrup a real winner. If you like it savory and sweet, add a side of their Cherrywood Smoked Bacon ($3) to the French French Toast for some fun with your food. Bacon dunked into maple syrup is such a childhood pastime.  Scramble also offers lunch after 11 a.m. with a menu of sandwiches, wraps, soups and salads, but breakfast is served all day. This is great because I could eat one of those cinnamon rolls anytime!",

The biggest draw for me?  Vegan French Toast! With their menu clearly marked with vegan, spicy, healthy choice, and even travel well options, they really lay it all out.  We were warmly greeted at the door by an employee and entered their restaurant to the typical hustle and bustle of a breakfast eatery. Scramble has a hip modern feel that is still warm and welcoming, and they pride themselves on using local farmers and vendors when possible.  With their counter service style it's speedier than a typical restaurant but there's still no feel of rush.  For those looking to stay in the know, several televisions host the news and free wifi is available.  After ordering at the counter our food was quickly delivered to our table of choice and we dug in.  While it was a little weird to have baguette style bread instead of the typical Texas toast, it was still delicious.  Oh French Toast, I love you.  I heard absolutely no complaints from my husband and I think he finished his entree before me.",

I had the scrambled tofu chorizo burrito and it was okay. Fairly bland quite honestly and with some simple changes in the recipe it could make it a lot better. The tofu seemed to be just plain tofu. Simply scrambling it with a little tumeric, salt and garlic would of made the burrito a lot better. The sweet potato hash was reeeally good though. All in all I'd like to see more vegan options and improvements on their vegan recipes.",

Walk-up ordering, with food runners that bring your meal out to you, and serve yourself beverages. It gets pretty packed here, but service is always friendly, pretty smooth, and very fast.   Really varied menu, with everything from pizzas/wraps and other light lunch fare to traditional breakfast items, and an entire vegan brunch section!   The vegan french toast is my go-to dish, but the soyrizo burrito is not bad, either (although it could do with more spice). The sweet potato hash that comes as a side is totally addicting-a perfect little combo of sweet potato and different types of squash. Vegan items come out on bright orange plates and they even carry vegan butter, etc. for your toast/bagel/whatever. Pretty neat.   They offer coffee/espresso drinks, most of which are really way too syrupy sweet for my taste, but the house drip is actually really quite good, as are their iced teas.   The patio here is amazing, even in the middle of the summer and winter-an unobtrusive misting system and sun shades keep it pretty nice (yes, thats relative) in the summer, and heat lamps warm it up in the winter. Dog-friendly, so there's always at least one cute pooch to play with while you're waiting for your meal.   If only it weren't such a trek from downtown!",

We were strapped for time but my girlfriend and I looked at each other and ran the risk of being late for an appointment.  It was not a long wait at all. About 5-7 minutes and I was sitting down just waiting on our food and drink. I got the Sante Fe Eggs Benedict w/ side Scramble Browns, Scramble Latte to drink.   It was really suprising with how busy it appeared how quickly the process was, our food arrived roughly another 5-10 min after sitting down.  The Sante Fe Eggs are fantastic and although I believe they served me with more hollandaise sauce than usual I was not disappointed or somehow the chef knew what I wanted. The jalapeno cornbread has those little pieces of corn and jalapeno in it so you know they weren't messing around. The whole thing together tastes so good the jalapeno adds a sweetness beneath the usual flavors of the ham and egg. The chipotle hollandaise was crazy good, I had to get as much as that as I could on pretty much everything. The scramble browns were great on their own but hey a little hollandaise doesn't hurt.   One thing. The menu states its spicy but I didn't so much as get a tingle of heat in my mouth. I suspect its a precautionary measure for those of the weaker fortitude but I recommend this to all. Don't be afraid of the spice, its nothing.  Overall, I cannot wait to come back and try their lunch paninis!  Also the staff were really friendly and nice. When we went they had someone offering small complimentary cups of coffee or OJ while waiting in line (they even had creamer!).",

Lucky I was not by myself, so I was able to try more than I could handle. The food was very good.  I had the Cinnamon Apple Energy Pancakes, made with whole oats, perfectly scrambled eggs, and I was able to taste a very good veggie omelet. The set was quick and easy. You order, you pay, you pick a open table, they bring your food to you.  First meal in Arizonia and it was good.",

Usually vegan breakfasts are limited to oatmeal and fruit cups, so I was pleasantly surprised to actually stumble across several options to choose from! The soyrizo tofu scramble burrito was pretty tasty, nothing crazy special. I was so happy that they had nutritional yeast, I added that for a cheesy kick. Cute place, wish there was one in the east valley!",

The amount of food given i could have gotten double at my favorite breakfast spot for the price paid. they scramble maybe like 1 or 2 eggs and throw in some meat but it just did not seem like a reasonable price for how little was on my plate and i paid extra for a slice of french toast. if i would have known that the french toast wasn't as amazing as some people make it to be they do not know mouth watering french toast like i do. If you are craving french toast go to Crackers and Co. Not scramble!  If i go to scramble again i would stick with the toast and potatoes with the scramble but i might try something else next time.  Then update my review. But for now i am sticking with the two stars for the taste of the meat lovers scramble.  I love how many hot sauces they had so it will give me more to experiment with next time.  Their rosemary potatoes are so much better than wildflower bread company whose are way too salty for my taste.    Service was decent even though its not a real sit down place where people constantly check to see how you are doing. So service in general too me wasn't anything out of this world over the top status.  The place itself was clean and comfortable. But not for a long period of time. :) Until then i wasn't so disappointed that i will never go again i am just not fond of how little food you get or think you will get for how much you spend. for $8 you get mostly bread and potatoes. Awesome right?  :|   :\\",

The Caramel Banana Pancakes were very good. The veggie scramble was good, but not amazing. Side of Jalapeno Corn Bread was good, almost very good.  Coffee however was mediocre, both the breakfast blend and Italian roast. Worse, there are no real cups. Plastic cups for water, to-go coffee cups for coffee. Kinda lame. Good vibe, lots of seating, nice outdoor patio.  Solid B. Missed a B+ due to lack of coffee mugs.",

I thought I should go with the house specialty and went with a \"Brizza\" - I ordered the Chicago, which has rosemary potatoes, sausage and cheese, but I substituted the regular sausage for turkey sausage.  Yummy.  The only disappointment was the crust - it was kind of doughy and just didn't have much flavor, thought they could have done more with it honestly (it was very plain).  I ended up eating mostly the toppings and left much of the pizza dough on the plate.  Extra points for having Coke products, and I will definitely have to return to try the french toast or cinnamon rolls.  I also liked the fact that your ordered & paid at the counter and then they brought your food out to you.  Very efficient and quick.  Overall, 2 thumbs up, and I will be back if I'm in the area for breakfast.",

We waited in line for 5-10 minutes but once we arrived to the counter, the cashier was both friendly and helpful in taking our orders.    I have been eating paleo the past several months and so I needed to make several substitutions to my scramble.  When asking for no cheese, the cashier readily asked \"would you like to substitute avocado instead?\" This, along with a couple others that were made with mine and my girlfriends were given at no extra charge.    Eating paleo, I've become quite accustom to paying an extra 3-5 bucks for making the meal sustainable when eating out.  This place blew me away in quality of food and the ease of ordering.

The steak was cooked perfectly and the meat was very fresh tasting.  This looks like to be a low sodium joint so I had to add in a few sprinkles of salt and pepper.  After that, the taste was perfect!  The eggs were very delicious.  I usually only eat eggs directly from the farm when at home.  The eggs here are on that level.  So tasty.  The steak and eggs tasted very wholesome.  The French Toast was the bomb.  Never seen french toast done like that .. but I like it.  One of the few reasons to live in Phoenix, would be to eat breakfast here. :)  Update 09/30/2016: Tried the huevos rancheros.  Nice fun healthy eating.    Also tried the Prime Rib Paninni.  It was good.  Update 10/15/2016: The breakfast biscuit and sausage grave was to die for.  Healthiest and tastiest I've had in ages.  It tasted like pure goodness. This is one of my favorite dishes so to get this right is hard.  The Sunrise Sandwich was delicious.  It's a cured bacon, egg and cheese sandwich over buttered grilled sourdough bread.  Really good breakfast.  The hashbrowns were burnt and only ate 1 bite.",

    "text": "Breakfast for Lunch  This was the first time I visited \"Scramble a Breakfast Joint\" based on the reviews of fellow \"Yelpers\". From the moment you walk in the door, you are greeted by a friendly staff member and you can't help but notice the cleanliness of the restaurant.   The menu is printed on the wall, so you place your order at the register, take a seat, and wait for your delicious meal to be delivered. There is a bottomless coffee and beverage station in the middle of the restaurant and TVs throughout the entire restaurant.  On this visit I had the buttermilk pancakes and bacon All I have to say is, these pancakes were not only delicious but made perfectly, soft and fluffy on the insdide and golden brown on the outside, perfect! and the bacon was thick, but not too thick; crispy but not too crispy; once again, perfect,  tasty and delicious.  I look forward to revisiting \"Scramble a Breakfast Joint\" again and try other delicious items offered on their menu.",

I was hassled about it and thankfully was still able to order since I'd been waiting in line forever, but I understand why dogs aren't allowed in. We'll be back!",

The food is tasty and the portions are generous - not gigantic. My Southwest burrito was tasty and I believe enjoyed the avocado with the chorizo. The salsa was very flavorful and paired perfectly with my meal. The hash browns are crispy and buttery - perhaps a tad too salty, but that wasn't a big deal to me. The coffee is tasty and not bitter. My iced caramel latte was sweet without being super sweet.   The service here is well above average with the bussers/wait staff managing to give a lot of attention to tables despite the fact that this is a busy restaurant. Staff are all friendly and seem to genuinely want to serve.  All my qualms are with the design of the place. When you arrive you wait in line and place your order at a register - not quite what I was expecting and it's not the most welcome first impression. The seating is alright. Not stellar but not horrible. I was fairly comfortable in one of the half booths holding my 4 month old the whole time.  The dining room is kept clean and the wait staff bus the tables very quickly.  In all I'd say it's a good choice for casual but quick breakfast.",

    "text": "I've visited this location several times over the last few years and have always found the breakfast food to be good by the standards of most trendy breakfast places in the area. But the best? Not quite. Personally, it kind of hovers between the 3 and 4 star range for me.  Scrambled opts for the \"do it yourself\" approach to dining. You order your food at the counter and they'll bring it out to you. You're pretty much responsible for everything else, including silverware, sauces, napkins, and filling up your drink. Not that there's anything wrong with that approach. I'm just not exactly sure what it is that you're wanting me to provide a tip for?   Anyway . . .   Whatever you order, if it comes with hash browns, upgrade them to their \"scramble browns,\" which are probably one of the best creations they have. It's traditional hash browns with cheese and bacon mixed in. We order it every time - without fail!  I usually get the two eggs (scrambled w/cheese), that comes with bacon, bread, and upgraded scramble browns. My girlfriend prefers their strawberry French toast, which I've never really been all too impressed with - as it's basically just the addition of some strawberry cream cheese.  We usually don't go to breakfast during busy hours, but prefer visiting in the early afternoon to avoid the crowds. With most places, this is rarely a problem, but something was definitely off in the kitchen when we arrived 30 minutes before close. I received my order immediately, while my girlfriend never did. Apparently, they had forgotten about her. When she finally said something, I was practically finished with my plate. To top it off, the order they gave her was incorrect. Mistakes happen and they took care of us in the end, but the mishap did seem odd considering the place only had a handful of diners.  Be warned that servings here are pretty small. With what you pay in comparison to some of the other places, don't expect to take anything home.  The breakfast, although slightly overpriced and undersized, is still above average in comparison to many places in Phoenix. Maybe if I were a vegan, vegetarian, or anti-gluten, I'd rate it more highly. The dog-friendly patio is a nice addition.  It's worth a visit if nothing else.",

Open on Christmas, thank you.  The bad: I see why you pay 1st here. We wanted to get a refund and leave but we stayed rather than deal with the hassle of starting over and going to another place on a holiday.  French toast was advertised as baguette dipped in vanilla custard. I got a cold breadstick with light grill marks on one side dipped in nothing.  The sausage was cold flavorless pig grease.  Hashbrowns are greasy by nature. These were finished with an oil drizzle over the top. Maybe truffle oil? Kinda weird. Not good.   Pancakes were rubbery. Had to saw on them to get a bite.  Pre packaged cold butter pads and cold generic syrup.  The service: When asked how everything was, I responded \"barely okay\". Server said great and cheerily started clearing our table mid bite. It was the friendliest get the eff out ever. Done with all the empathy of a serial killer.  As I write this I'm eating 2 day old nuked pizza. 1. Because I'll be allowed to finish. 2. Because it's better.  A member of my party described the place as the prettiest left overs she's ever eaten.",

My friends and I like to brunch here and maybe it's their company combined with good food that's doing the trick but something about going here brings me joy.   There's usually a line out the door but it moves fast. They have a menu in the hallway so you can decide on your order while you wait in line. They bring the food to your table but everything else is self serve like getting your cutlery, napkins, etc.   The food is delicious, I have never been disappointed nor have ever heard my friends complain about their food. I have gotten the strawberry filled fresh toast which was delicious and recently got the regular french toast which is honestly just as good, so just depends on what I am in the mood for. The savory items on their menu look delicious but, only if I can keep my sweet tooth under control, I would order them. I usually just end up stealing some from my friend's plate, oh! yum hash browns!   The OJ and other drinks come in a to-go cup which is convenient if you don't end up finishing it, which is not the case with me. The place is clean including the bathrooms. They have a pretty spacious patio, I always leave telling myself I will eat there next. So, maybe next time I will!",

Although there is a Vegan Menu, there are many other items on the menu that can easily be veganized.

Hopefully the owners will put a vegan version of the HR on the regular menu.    Our meals always turn our delicious!  And, we appreciate the almond milk for our Lattes.

I got there and there was a line out the door.  WHOA!  The ordering line moved pretty quick.  It is nice to have menus posted where you wait in line, so read up, decide, and order when it is your turn.    I was craving the french toast.  Their version is french baquette, hand cut & dipped in vanilla custard.  And served with a side of applewood bacon.  I also ordered a side of the rosemary potatoes.  I am sucker for potatoes, I just LOVE them.  After ordering, you get your cup and go to the island of drinks (coffees, teas, & sodas).  You get your own utesiles, napkins, etc.  And then pick a seat.    M picked a 2 seater table.  Sweet!  The employee check on us and see how we are doing.  The sweetest people that work there!!  Our food came and it was pretty good.  One of three my pieces of french toast was on the hard side.  The poatoes were pretty good, nothing too special.    There was a group sitting next to us (they were split up because of the amount of people they had).  They kept looking at us to move but we did not.  We are enoying our breakfast, we did not even finish our food YET.  Then just just kept looking at us.  Really?  Finally they moved another table so they can all sit together.  I got refills and came back, we chatted for a little bit then another family member was standing over our table.  He asked us to move so he can sit his group.  We just left the place.    Food is pretty good but the other partons are rude, annoying, and jerks.",

When it is busy they have a smiling employee that meets you at the front door to offer you coffee or water.   The menu has breakfast and lunch items and I have eaten almost everything on it. I have some favorites like the breakfast pizza and the meat lover's scramble. Everything I have eaten I have enjoyed and it has always been brought out in a timely manner.  The dining area and restroom has always been clean when I have eaten there. Equally, the patio outside is well kept.   I highly recommend Scramble to anybody looking for a quality breakfast or lunch in a clean environment with modern upbeat music and dynamic television monitors.",

You guys, they have a VEGAN menu. Seriously. I've stuck to the tofu scrambles but have wanted to try their vegan french toast (made with vanilla custard) for a while but am never that adventurous. I hate sweet stuff in the morning. The only thing I have tried and didn't like was their vegan breakfast burrito. It was a bit too plain.  I love their veggie omelet, veggie scramble and their eggs benedict with no meat is rad. Hey! Most people don't know but you can switch out your rosemary potatoes for a sweet potato and mushroom hash (IT'S SO GOOD) or opt for the bacon brown (my boyfriend loves these). The bacon brown is a potato cake with bacon and cheese inside. He also loves their sunrise sandwich (opt for bacon instead of sausage).   They have breakfast pizzas (brizzas), mutli-grain pancakes (THEY'RE DELICIOUS) and tons of other options. They source a lot of their vegetables from local farms and their iced teas are quality! Expect about $10-12 for breakfast and a 15 minute wait for your food (even when they're packed). We always leave happy.",

Enough for getting full without leaving you feeling like you gained five pounds.  The servers are also overly attentive, visiting tables to ask if you need water, condiments or anything else.  The decor is very bright! They take the morning/sunrise concept to the extreme! But that also goes for the cleanliness and swift service.",

We call Scramble and are told it is a ten minute wait. We're just a couple blocks away so we're in the parking lot in about five minutes. Considering the line is out the door, down the sidewalk, and into the parking lot, I'm having second thoughts as we stop at the end of a long queue with a lot of people mumbling (more than a few conversations about how many open tables were inside). An insincerely chipper employee at the door calls for the line to form further down the sidewalk \"so no one gets run over by a car in the parking lot.\"  I figure the line must move quickly but, after seeing the line is growing I can only assume that, at best, the wait is ten minutes after you finally get the counter to order. We scope out the situation for a few minutes as the line continues to grow and our position moves forward only about four feet. Clearly ten minutes was a lie. I call another place, find out they have no wait, and we start walking back to our car. As we approach the vehicle, an unprompted farewell is called to us, \"Take care! Have a good morning!\" Honestly, I didn't know if the chipper employee was being rude or just didn't realize that we'd never actually entered the establishment. Either way, I don't really care. This was just such a disappointing experience that I was just glad to get out.",

Don't be afraid of the Santa Fe Benedict description, it is flavorful NOT spicy.  The cornbread bottoms have a hint of Jalapeno and the sauce has just a hint of spice. It is truly a desert classic.

Anyways, we looked over the menu and I ordered the chorizo burrito breakfast, and my husband ordered  steak and eggs. Both came with the rosemary potatoes. We also ordered 2 iced teas and a cinnamon roll to bring home. Service was very fast. The staff friendly and the decor had clean lines and was pretty hip. Not fancy, but kinda along the same style as Ikea. The chairs were hard metal. Not to uncomfortable but they looked nice. The vibe is loud, music and plenty of T.Vs every where. And the place is bustling. I did not mind one bit actually. This would be a great place for tourists staying at The Pointe to pop in before they head out for a busy day in Phoenix. My burro arrived and I dug in.  Folks, I like more chorizo than eggs. I am used to having the egg holding the chorizo together. This burro had way more egg and less chorizo. It was like peek a boo chorizo burro. I order one of these so rarely and  I expect them  to be a spicy, sausage fest. I don't want to have to rely on the salsa that came with it to kick it up for me, Although, that salsa had a great flavor! Something I don't care for but it did not taste bad at all. Just more eggy. It also had avocado and a very thin layer of jalapeno cream cheese. I wish it had more. I could not even taste it and had to open up the burro because I did not believe it was there. I asked for my potatoes extra well done and they were just served the regular way. They were good, but not made to my liking. My husband enjoyed his steak and the eggs were ordered over medium but came back with the whites not as set as he liked. More sunny side up. But he loved the potatoes. I was shocked, because he does not care for any type of chunky home fries and hates rosemary. But he thought they were delish. His breakfast also came with a side of toast (sourdough).  I dove in to the cinnamon roll. It was pretty good a bit dry, but not bad and the they gave me a ton of icing to go with it!  They also have a few different flavors of iced tea as well as coffee so something for everyone.  I do plan on going back and will try the french toast. It looked yummy and I almost got it, and should have gone with my gut! I plan on ordering it next time!  The eggs benedict also looked great! The service was friendly and the price is not cheap but not to bad either. Less than Cracker Barrel but more than Denny's. And they had all sorts of side dishes that were relatively inexpensive. I am going to update my review as soon as I return to Scramble to get my french toast on! I like the fact they buy local and I love supporting a local business. Even though its a bit of a drive, I believe this place deserves a second review.",

    "text": "I love this place.  I discovered Scramble a couple of years ago, and fell in love with their brizzas (breakfast pizzas... clever, right?), various scrambles and omelettes, and jalepeno corn bread.  Great sides, too.  Oh, and bottomless coffee... and free WiFi.  One year I actually did all of my Christmas shopping from a laptop at Scramble while enjoying some tasty food and milking cup after cup of coffee.  I left feeling satisfied (although maybe a bit jittery).  Last year, though, my husband and I got into the plant-based craze and mostly swore off eggs and dairy.  I mourned the loss of this great breakfast option... because although there were lots of vegetarian items on the menu, finding an egg-less option at a breakfast joint named \"Scramble\" just wasn't going to happen.  For months I ignored this place when I drove by, then one day I happened to see their most recent menu online... and to my amazement, found they had added an entire vegan menu!  The next morning, we savored a vegan breakfast burrito and vegan scramble, along with this great sweet-potato based side dish they serve with the veg options.  Will be returning another time for the vegan french toast, too!  They even use different utensils and plates for serving their vegan items and different pots and stuff in the kitchen.  The waitress said those items have become hugely popular.  Another bonus?  Bottomless coffee with soy milk in a container with all the other creamers.  Since pretty much every other coffee shop charges a premium for soy milk, that was just one more bonus.  And if you want something cold, they have amazing, tasty iced teas from a local tea company in Tempe.  Yum.  I'm back in love.",

He had one of the egg burritos and I couldn't resist the huge cinnamon buns. Loved the decor -- simple, modern, yet not trendy -- and the fact that the place had a buzz to it. We saw everything from young families to senior couples dining inside.  The waitstaff was gracious and friendly and had no problem letting us take our time and read the Sunday paper. They circulated free samples of various items on the menu and offered to refill our coffee in a to go cup as they were shutting down.  I can't wait until the weather gets a little cooler and we can take advantage of their outdoor patio.  Prices were moderate; there were lots of healthy options on the menu too.",

We ordered 2 meals + 2 coffees and the bill was $20...that seemed very reasonable.  I had the Gringo Breakfast Burrito and my husband had the Brizza (Breakfast Pizza)  We actually could have split the Brizza actually. The meal portions were quite large (we have leftovers for tomorrow's breakfast!). Great value. We met the owner and he was very nice :) It wasn't too loud, which we like, because it's our time to chat...quiet jazz music playing in the background; not too loudly! Our food was very tasty.  Coffee was good too. We will definitely be going back to try the other items on the menu.",

A couple of differetn kinds of them.  The only drawback I had...the free standing chairs and tables in the front area can get a little crowded.  May need to lose a couple of them.  Nice large patio though.     Over all its the best breakfast goin in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I chose to eat at Scramble due to the lack of well reviewed and decently priced Scottsdale breakfast locations. Upon entering, we found ourselves in a long line of yelper foodies in the same situation as we were. The decor is modern and the ordering set up is like a fast food joint: wait in line, order, find a seat and wait for your food. The wait was about 20 minutes and there are tvs set up to enjoy while waiting at your table. Although important, these details are not by any means the reason for a two star review. The food and the pricing was actually a bit over hyped. Our meal, for two people, cost almost $30 and the portions were VERY small. I ordered the baguette french toast which was chewy, tasty, and pretty small. This dish is an off shoot from traditional french toast which and was ordinary at best. The bacon that accompanied this dish was very good and you only get two slices. I also ordered a side of rosemary potatoes for around $3 which were dry and cold. My girlfriend got the meat lovers scramble and considering the name of the restaurant, we figured this breakfast would be a sure shot. Well it wasnt. The scramble was skimpy, dry, bland, light on the meat, and came with the same rosemary potatoes and hard cold toast. Also, we were very dissappointed with the cinnamon roll because it did not look anything like it did in the picture. It was dry and slathered with overpowering cream cheese frosting. The only saving grace for this place was the orange juice, which seemed to be freshly squeezed, and the coffee. We won't be returning for another visit.",

I liked the decor and ambiance. We sat on the patio-which really sets this place above other restaurants, however that type of space/set-up is hard to come by in Phoenix. Being dog-friendly was another plus. There were several things I wanted to try, But I opted for the Gouda and bacon Brizza and Dave had the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict. Of course I had coffee - and it was delicious! The Brizza was very big, I ate just 1/2 (at it stuck with me all day). I felt the cheese/bacon proportions were perfect and flavorful. I sampled the eggs benedict - also delicious! I felt the prices were good and the menu selection was well balanced. Obviously I am not a vegetarian; however I respect their large vegetarian menu and their practice of separating the cooking areas and dishes - definitely not an easy task on their part - so that is very cool. I can't wait to try some other dishes!",

    "text": "Scramble has become a new favorite spot for breakfast... and clearly from the number of people that are packed in on any given visit, I am not alone.   This is one of those places that I had to ignore my first impressions. My initial thought was 'oh dear, another trendy spot that never lives up to the hype\". And with it's wall menu and counter ordering, it is a trendy. But there are several points that clearly raise the comfort level.   Between the wall of windows and bright lighting there is an airy feel to the place. The drink bar in the center of the room is a five-star bonus IMO. Yes, I have been accused of being a control freak in the past (and they say it like it's a bad thing...) but I love being able to create the perfect cup of coffee, suited for my tastes and mine alone. The tables, while very close together are always serviced immediately to accommodate the constant inflow of patrons. And even though the place always seems to be brimming to the rim, I have never felt rushed through either my meal or my paper. I also love the various selections on the flat screens that encircle the room. There is literally something for everyone (and how many people can actually say that they shared their yogurt parfait with Ed Begley Jr. on GTV?!!).   Now for the food. I've been enough times to have sampled quite a few offerings and have even begun to create a list of favorites. On the top of that favorite list is the Gringo-Cherrywood bacon, egg & cheddar cheese Breakfast Burrito. This thing is large enough for two, or a second meal and is literally stuffed full of the perfect balance of egg, meat, and cheese! Ask for extra salsa, because one cup is not nearly enough for this big boy!!! The Brizzas (breakfast pizzas) and French Toast (baguette slices dipped in vanilla custard) are also tops on my list. As far as sides go, the Scramble Hash Browns are a must have! They seem to take a little longer to make and are really more of a hash brown/bacon/cheese tart-lette which are browned to perfection. I have literally had to defend mine from incoming utensils and believe that a quick thrust of the fork to the back of the offenders hand is quite an effective technique...   My only real criticism of the place is that if you have placed separate orders, your food may not be served at the same time. But this is so minor in comparison to the quality and the fact that clearly everything is made to order (not pre-done and waiting to be placed on a plate), that I can't really hold this against them. Then again, it may simply be that I have an addiction to those hash brown cakes! ; )   On-line ordering is coming to their website and that will add an additional level of love for this place.   This is a welcome addition to the breakfast scene and if you are in need of some flavorful morning num-nums, Scramble on over!",

They we're excited and started to tell us the good food they had and what to try.. well after getting my food we saw the owner walk in after from being on the news station.. I can see that his waitress was tell him that he had a few costumers coming in cause they seen him on TV making food she seemed more excited then he was LOL He kinda just glanced at us and went to the back... Then after finishing half my meal the waitress came over and said \"ok moment of truth how is the food?\" I told her it was excellent.. I just wish the owner was the one going around with his costumers, I thought maybe after being on TV he would have at least went around to his costumers that came in after seeing him on TV asked them how his food was and how the service was but is stead he stood at the counter talking to his busty sexy waitresses in the front, picked up and left. He wasn't busy so I don't see why he didn't have time... but other then that it was great LOL...",

    "text": "Knife and I recently dined at Scramble on 7th Street for a late breakfast.  The location is in an L-shaped strip mall and is easy to find since it's on the corner.  There is ample parking right in front of the door.  There is a large patio which fronts 7th Street however since the temperatures were hovering around 105* we opted to have our meal inside!  One flaw, which unfortunately is found at many restaurants, is upon walking in the door the menu is mounted on the wall on several large panels.  This causes many diners to stop and read which subsequently backs up the line.  There are also printed menus located in a wall holder.  Since this was a first time visit for Knife and I we needed to review the menu before proceeding to the order counter.  While perusing the menu, we let several people pass us.    Knife decided on the Phoenix omelet -- chorizo, green chiles, cheddar and pico de gallo with a side of sausage.  While my selection was a Veggie omelet -- squash, zucchini, sun-dried tomatoes, red onion, bell peppers and Monterey jack cheese.  The omelets are serviced with hash browns and a bread choice.  Instead of hash browns, I substituted sweet potato hash.    The good news is the Veggie omelet was very tasty; the sun-dried tomatoes was the dominate flavor and the were very flavorful!  The sweet potato hash was a nice change from the run of the mill hash browns.  The not so good news, Knife wasn't impressed with his Phoenix omelet or the sausage.  He said both were flavorless.  Typically when an omelet has chorizo it is jammed packed with flavor, sadly this was not the case.  Perhaps we hit Scramble on a bad morning.  On the plus side, Scramble has a rewards program which is offered when ordering.  To join just provide a cell phone number and within seconds a text is received indicating how many points have been accumulated.  The points are based on the dollar amount spent.  In addition, the restaurant is light and bright with cute food sayings on the walls.  It is self-serve for drinks and utensils.    Scramble was a nice experience and Knife and I will need to give it another try.  --Fork of Fork 'n Knife  Be sure to check out the reviews written by my critic in food, Knife of Knife 'n Fork.  Bon Appetite!",

I can never finish the whole thing, usually end up taking about half of it home.   I love the dog friendly patio. Service is usually quick and efficient. I'm so happy they are opening a Scramble in Scottsdale! We will definitely continue to be regulars.",

If I want comfort food, it's worth it! The chicago brizza is amazing!  Still loving the tea! Venetian peach iced, chamomile hot.  Can't beat the mountain views when facing the window or on the patio.  Efficient, friendly service.  Always something to provoke conversation on the tv's and there's usually 3-4 different stations showing.  I love coming here on the weekend!",

We some times just stop in to get the jalapeno cornbread to go because it's so yummy, but, especially on a lazy Sunday morning, Scramble is a great place for breakfast or brunch.  I really like the Toluca brizza, but my boyfriend prefers the Santa Fe Benedict.  Because Scramble uses such fresh ingredients, EVERYTHING tastes great.  The servers are very sweet and attentive, and the atmosphere is really homey.  Scramble is our go-to spot for breakfast and brunch.  ENJOY!",

But after reading the reviews on yelp I convinced her we should try it!   We were not disappointed! We went on a Sunday morning at 10 so it was pretty busy - but the line went quickly and were able to find a seat.   I loved that the offered loose leaf hot tea and got one of my favorites - Irish Breakfast. My mom got coffee and said it was really good. We had to wait a little while for our meal (maybe 20 minutes) but it was fine as we weren't in a rush.   I got the French Toast with Bacon and it was delicious. I loved the bread they use and it wasn't \"eggy\" like some. The bacon was awesome - thick and meaty - not thin and fatty like most breakfast joints.   My mom got the veggie omelette. She said there was a weird flavor she didn't like (maybe the sun-dried tomatoes?) but she substituted the Scramble Brown (a potato cake with bacon and cheese) and fell in love! She said next time she would just get those. I tried it and it was yummy!  She said her toast was really good too!   I loved the modern decor and the staff were all very friendly. Glad we took a chance and tried this place! Will definitely be back!!!!!",

Food was great. Sister and I ordered eggs bene, right brain had traditional two eggs, etc. with fresh OJ.   with so many choices here in Phoenix I will come back for sure. It was different, fun, fast. The small crowd that was there early were all happy, possibly hung over ( uh, moi?), or families getting away from family. You know how the holidays can go? Next trip out Valley of The Sun, see ya then!",

Coffee is very delicious.  Had their Huevos Rancheros.  Not your traditional Mexican style but a great twist to a traditional dish.  We sat on the patio even though their were definitely tables inside.  Many times when there is not a lot of people on the patio patrons on the patio can inadvertently get less attention but this was not the case.  The staff was very attentive but not overly attentive.  I would definitely come back here again.",

The process is that the customer steps inside the front door and joins a long line.  It took 15 minutes to get up to the front and give our order.  There was exactly one person working taking orders.  I would rather sit down, order, and have a leisurely cup of coffee while I'm waiting.  Standing in a line was just not what I wanted to do.    I admit that this didn't seem to bother other people, so maybe it's just me.  I would not come back to this particular restaurant because I do not like standing in a long line before i can even order.  Reminds me of a college cafeteria.",

Finally after 51 minutes we got to the front of the line and placed our orders and seated ourselves. We had 17 empty tables from which to choose.   The food was cold and boring and very small portions. Mine came out in about 10 minutes (acceptable) and my date's took another 20 minutes. So now I'm faced with do I eat or do I let mine get completely cold, not to mention I felt rude eating when my date had nothing. When his food finally came out, you'd think it'd be piping hot but it was also cold.   The waitress came by and asked how everything was and my date laughed and shook his head. The waitress said, \"Awesome!\" and whisked my plate away mid-bite. Uhh, do you want us to leave? Sorry we've been here so long but you did take forever to get both plates to the table!   I think this place is coasting on its reputation - and maybe it used to be good - but I've tried it twice with similar lackluster experiences both times. $36 for two breakfasts, two coffees, a long line, and poor service? Definitely won't be back.",

You had a line out the door for 20+ mins to then finally realize \"oh we better jump on the keep the line moving\"...Now the food we ordered wasn't the best. I got the sunshine sandwich  and my fiance got The Phoenix omelette. The sandwich I ordered was overly greasy and the hash browns  that came with my meal were cold. I don't think I'll ever go back because this was my first time here and the customer service needs to be revised.   If you see that you have a line out the door then maybe have another employee jump on to take orders instead of making people stand in line for 20 minutes to then get the bright idea to have someone help take orders!!!   At this point, for the amount of money we spent I would've rather went to Cracker Barrel or Snooze for better service.",

The hashbrowns with cheese and bacon is also good, but I really can't get over how slightly pricey they are considering what you get.   Pretty much everything is ala carte. There really isn't a complete meal on the menu. The yummy french toast comes alone. Yeah, you get a lot of french toast, but really nearly $7 for just french toast? It should come with a side of bacon or hash browns. After you add a side your breakfast not including a drink is $10. I just think it's a tad high considering I could go most anywhere else and get a complete meal for less.   I can't spend $30 on breakfast for me and my husband when A) we aren't getting full on meals and B) if I'm not getting any boozy breakfast drinks. Still, I do enjoy breakfast here.",

The menu is along the side of the entrance (just like Pei Wei) and you order at the counter.  You place your order, get your number, and find a seat.  The food selection is pretty awesome.  Peanut butter chip pancakes, pigs in a blanket, cinnamon rolls, french toast...it all sounds so good.  We ordered a smattering of things to try and they were all great.  The pancakes that we ordered were buttermilk and they were great.  Light and fluffy with a cinnamony butter and maple syrup.  Good stuff.  The sausage was nice and spicy inside the pigs in a blanket.  It was great.  I can't wait to go back to Scramble.  Not as good as Matt's but it feels like a healthier breakfast that you could actually consume without waiting outside for an hour.",

The fact that every single review does not focus solely on this morning opus to the Southwest confirms what I have always suspected: the dry heat has finally shriveled Phoenicians' tastebuds into tiny pieces of gravel.   I kid, I kid. The Santa Fe is poached eggs and ham atop oh-so-yummy jalapeno cornbread, smothered in a chipotle hollandasie. It's got a kick, so isn't for the faint of mouth, and I can see where it might be a bit rich for some, but for me and my entree-splitting spouse, it's the best of the Southwest on a plate.   I've also tried the caramel banana pancakes, the Scramble hash brown (think hash browns juicing on bacon and cheese), and the chorizo brizza (Brizza= breakfast+pizza. Get it?). The brizza was huge, and for me a huge miss. It made me feel sluggish and greasy just looking at it. Everything else? An A-OK.   Scramble offers order-at-the-counter service and the interior is bright and cheery. They also have a dog-friendly patio where they're always sweet to my pup, who loves Scramble because of the fussing, fawning, big water bowl, and occasional dropped breakfast potato.   Pros: Yumminess, fast service, cheerful interior, large patio, dog-friendly.   Cons: Paper coffee cups (I'm stubborn and I want a cermaic MUG!), cross-armed frowners who complain about the quickly moving line.",

The order system is like Pei Wei, line up and order at the counter get a number and sit down. Bad news, the wait was long, the good news, the food is great. I guess, I revealed that I'm impatient and want instant gratification. Thank God that they gave me a cup for coffee after we ordered and got our number to pin on the table on those \"Alligator Clips\". Every time I use those things, I flash back to the early 70's using those clips for that last toke that then gave the super munchies.  Coffee, $2.50 a cup for a bottomless cup with plenty of choices and in a to go cup. Atmosphere.....very hip look, open ceilings, nice patio, great colors and great sayings on the wall to remind us of cool sayings to remember while we nosh. Breakfast came pretty quickly considering how many people were in the restaurant . I had a breakfast burrito that was plump and was plenty of food. I just hoped for more....maybe those alligator clips reminded me of the munchies of the 70's. Sandra had a cinnamon roll and although I thought it could have been bigger....she enjoyed and said \"It was fine and filling\".  Saw several friends there, all overweight and they said the portions were very satisfying.   This is stupid but I love it. The Dyson hand dryers in the bathroom. They are the best. I'll be back for more and they can earn that fifth star I'm sure.",

My dining companion commented that it felt like a cafeteria.  There was no service to speak of, and I had to fetch my drink out of a refrigerator.  You'd think that would keep the price down, wouldn't you?  Well, it didn't.  I ordered the pigs-in-a-blanket, and the blanket was awful.  I ended up eating the pigs, which were uncanny in appearance and taste to the sausage links that my high-school band sold as a fund-raiser.

So many things on the menu looked delicious, and I had a hard time deciding what to get.  For starters, they have pancakes with peanut butter chips!  YUM!  Any restaurant that does peanut butter chip pancakes gets bonus points from me.  The rest of the menu varies from omelets to brizzas (breakfast pizzas) to good ol pigs in a blanket.  The husband and I decided to share a few things.  We got the peanut butter chip pancakes, the pigs in a blanket, and a cinnamon roll.  The pancakes were awesome and HUGE!  After just one I was already feeling full.  The pigs in a blanket were absolutely delicious, primarily because of the yummy and kind of spicy breakfast link.  The cinnamon roll was also tasty, nice and fresh, but not too cinnamony.    Back to the concept of this place... once it had started to pick up again in terms of customers, I noticed how quickly the cashier was able to clear out the line.  I also noticed that the food was coming out at a really quick pace, and absolutely nothing sat on the line waiting to be served.  It works really well, but I am most interested in seeing how it works when the place gets absolutely slammed.  Overall, this is an excellent place to try.  You will not be disappointed with your fresh and delicious breakfast that doesn't make you feel heavy and gross after you leave.  A cool place for sure.",

I thought they were great and they came with two sausage patties for less than $8. Hubby had western omelet. He really enjoyed it and it was also huge and less than $8. It also came with two thick slices of toast (cut on the diagonal for 4 triangles total) and rosemary potatoes that were good.   We went early in the afternoon on a Saturday and most of the breakfast/lunch crowd had dissipated.  We definitely will eat here again.",

    "text": "First of all, let me state that I usually don't do reviews, generally. However I was looking for a breakfast place on Christmas Day, and you know how that is. Most are closed or if open, they are usually the typical chains that are in many cities. I was looking for another place other than one of the chains since the one I was currently at was very busy, I came across Scramble on an internet search. It was a ways away from where I was but since it was one of those days when I wouldn't have much in choices, I decided to give it a try. I did call them and make sure how late they were open. I have a couple hours before they closed since they closed at 2 p.m. (On this particular day.)  Ok, Food first: I am generally at really picky eater. You know, I like my hash browns not too crispy but not too soft, like my eggs with the white cooked but the middle semi cooked, you know the usual, what you usually can't find. However when I arrived at Scramble I was a little concerned since it is the cafeterias type where you walk up to the counter and order, they give you a tag with a number on it to put on the table you chose so they can bring the order to you. Not typically my style!  I have to say though, this is a bit different.  I was treated by Sherry, who was very bubbly, considerate, intuitive, and helpful, in fact I thought at first she was one of the owners since her attitude just seem to reflect that. More on that later. She assisted me with the order since I never been there before, even suggesting a hash brown patty that I found out was excellent later. I ordered coffee and water also &  was given cups so I could go to an island & serve myself. By the way their Italian roast is an excellent coffee. I like it strong, and it was but not with a bite or an aftertaste, smooth but strong! My type of coffee!  Ok. Food: They had excellent choices, many healthy choices as well as many just good & tasty! The portions we're good. Average but we're proportionately correct for the price. I happen to like to eat a lot in one sitting so it was a little less than I normally like but still filled me up fine! It should be noted that it was served on a real plate and was presented very nicely on that plate. It took no more than 10 minutes after I ordered it so they were very quick. It was very tasty with a lot of distinguishable variations in my scramble, in other words, someone knew how to cook back there to make sure the taste blended well with one another. I don't recall exactly which scramble I ordered but it did have a combination of eggs, cheese, red pepper, onions and probably a few other things in there. I also had the hash brown patty which was excellent and it came with a side of toast in a twist of orange.  So let's talk about the service a moment. Like I said earlier,  the one that took my order Sherry, is one of the managers, along with her managing partner Mike. Both excellent.   First of all she was very professional and yet enthusiastic, with a \"Glad You Are Here\" attitude, which, in consideration it was a holiday, was very impressive since most employees would want to be at home with your family on that day. However you would never know that from her attitude or from the way she worked; even cleaning and bussing tables enthusiastically, and with a smile, interaction between employees and customers, and even catching my eye when I looked up at her with a question. Of which she immediately responded.  She is very good at what she does. I had some questions on the coffee since I liked it.  By the way, they do sell it there and her and the other manager Mike, answered all my questions professionally and efficiently. Mike even listened to some of my suggestions about coffee since I have a little bit of experience behind that. Which also reflected his excellent managerial quality.  I also noticed that the rest of the employees had smiles and were busy working which is probably a reflection of the managerial staff. Like I mentioned earlier I assumed they were owners, but when I spoke to Sherry expressing that I thought they were the owners, (With Mike standing next to her), they both stated that they were just the managers but to look forward to someday perhaps being owners of place such as this.  I also noticed that they both, when you spoke to them, give you their full attention and eye contact. This is very important in managers, people want to know that you are listening to them whether they have a problem which simply want to express their likes or dislikes. Sherry and Mike did this excellently. Obviously both of them set an example to the fellow employees to make the difference for this place and all of this being done on a holiday when you would expect them to want to be home.  Alright, I don't know who the owners are, I do hope they read this review.  I want to qualify couple things. First I do not know Sherry or Mike, I have never known them, until I met them at this restaurant. Excellent employees & place!!",

Scramble offers many breakfast and lunch options for vegan, vegetarians and regular meat eating folks.  I decided to try one of the vegan options: a spinach, mushroom and sun dried tomato tofu scramble with sweet potato hash and rye toast. I also got a soy mocha and an OJ. Everything was brilliant and the coffee was the best one I've had in the US so far. I struggled to finish but made sure I stuck at it until I did.  Food service was prompt and customer service not bad either. The server pointed out a few touristy places nearby for us to look at and was pretty friendly. The outdoor seating was nice and the had a good mountain view.   The server advised us they were looking to expand into other locations in the near future. My vote is for New York, hope to see you here Scramble :D",

The food was served warm and my burrito stayed at a nice warm temperature throughout the meal.  The music is way too loud and is really quite awful.  Right now \"why can't we be friends\" is blaring and it's soul crushing.  EVERY SINGLE SONG so far has had a very strong snare drum that is giving me a headache.  I'm not kidding.  Every single song, including this Spanish \"waiting for tonight\" one now playing.  This is not a relaxing ambience.  I guess they're going for high energy?  Hash browns are fine, though they needed salt and pepper.  Nice crunch on the top.  The Costa burrito was very mild, but had a good texture thanks to the crunchy bacon and hash brown potatoes.  The chorizo was rather bland.  The flour tortilla didn't have flavor and was nothing special (not made in-house or by a good tortilleria).  When I picked up the second half it was in a grease puddle I had to wipe off.  Overall though it was a solid 4 star burrito.  The female employees' orange uniform tees are sheer and you can see their black undergarments through them.  It looks very unprofessional.",

I chose cheddar but it was cold strips of cheddar that didn't and couldn't do anything for the dry omelette with tasteless almost nonexistent cheese. It was one of the worst omelettes I've ever had. It was flavorless and dry. The hash browns that came with it were hash browns lol The friendly staff saved this review but if the omelettes are crap then I don't want to try anything else. They have orange juice cups in a bin of ice by the cashier. The orange juice was the best part of my breakfast. Skip this place and make your own breakfast at home. Even McDonald's has better eggs.",

    "text": "The husband and I love this place. We have been coming here ever since we moved to the neighborhood and both the food and service is consistently amazing. We have tried most of the breakfast menu but haven't dived into the lunch menu. Our favorite is the Gouda brizza (breakfast pizza) - smoked gouda, bacon, hollandaise sauce, and scrambled eggs. Yum! On lazy weekends, we order this to go and enjoy back at our place. When we dine in, it's a mix. Their Costa breakfast burrito is delicious - something the husband orders frequently. I really like their mushroom and bacon omelet, but I also enjoy their \"two eggs anyway\" meal. I normally get scrambled eggs, bacon, pancakes, and fruit (instead of potatoes). Super delicious and filling. Another favorite are the Biscuits and Gravy. Now this is amazing! The biscuits are super soft on the inside and slightly crunchy on the outside. They just melt in your mouth! The gravy is the perfect accompaniment. It's thick and filled with sausage. These are some of the best B&Gs I've had! The best part is how inexpensive yet utterly delicious they are!   I love that it's a local place that uses local food. Everything is fresh and the staff is outstanding. We've taken both sets of parents here as well as friends. This is definitely the go-to breakfast place. If you are ever in the area, you should definitely check it out!",

They brought water to our dog. They had warmers over head - it was cold today! They brought some little wax sticks for our 3 year old to play with. The food was awesome- great menu to choose from. We ordered some flavored coffee drinks and they were awesome! I can't wait to hike again and come back! What a great find we came across today!",

I had a coupon on my phone one day but the cashier couldn't find it.  I said \"Ill just ask next time\".  The next time I went it was expired though. Sometimes the servers are really right on and sometimes just so so.  One more item is the french toast.  They don't let it soak in egg long enough so as soon as you cut in, it's just WHITE BREAD!  If it wasn't for those things, they could be a 5 star",

Their eggs are so light and fluffy but I was more impressed that they make their own bread. We had their jalapeno bread that comes with their omelette and it was AMAZING! The consistency was more of a cornbread but it is a must try. The atmosphere was very modern and trendy which was pretty surprising considering it's not located on the best side of town.

The oatmeal was not only the biggest bowl of oatmeal I've ever seen, it was served piping hot with pecans, raisins, and milk / brown sugar on the side.  I also had a side of egg whites done just right.  (I was trying to be healthy since I recently realized I gained some LBS in the last few months).  However, I did have a few bites of my dining companion's brizza - it was also delicious!  The coffee did the job too... I left with a nice caffeine buzz and a full tummy too... the perfect way to start my day!  I love the clean, urban feel to this place... the staff was super friendly and the bathrooms were clean.  I wish I lived closer to Scramble as it would definitely be a regular in my rotation.  Even though it's a bit of a drive for me, I will be back... especially to check out their upcoming \"breakfast for dinner\" charity events on Wednesday nights.  (Stay tuned for info on the Yelp events calendar).  You've got a new fan in me, Scramble... see you again soon!",

I chose the Spinach and Mushroom Tofu Scramble that came with sundried tomatoes, hash browns, toast with vegan butter, all cooked with a multitude of spices. Not only was the service fantastic, but the food was delicious! The staff member even thanked my friend and I for being vegan when delivering the food-- I found the gesture very thoughtful!

Yes its a local place who uses fresh ingredients.. But so what. The culinary makeup in this town is at its peak and i feel like scramble is coasting by with a pass.  Pancakes are always undercooked and plain. Hashbrowns Always undercooked and flavorless. The eggs for every meal weather it be omelette, scramble, plain..is simply lack luster. The amounts used in each omelette is very scarce. There is just nothing creative or unique about any of it.  Every time lately i wait in line for over 15 mins and there is barely anyone seated. I kept trying the restaurant simply because i live a block away..but.. Im over it.",

To me it lives up to what french toast is supposed to be. Sweet, cinnamon, vanilla goodness! Although a little too sweet for me. 4/5  The scamble browns i completely fell in love with.. these are pure heaven to me. Creamy, rich, bacon, cheese, and egg all mashed together with potatos...  1000/5   I felt so sad when i dropped part of my scramble browns on the floor.

    "text": "Stopped in here to get some breakfast. The food was very good! Only thing that was annoying was the line moved pretty slow to place the order. It's one of those places you walk in, look at a large menu up on the wall, and place your order as soon as you approach the cash register. Sorta like a typical fast food joint. But yea- the line wasn't very long and it took quite a bit before I made my way up to the register. I guess since where I'm from everything is so fast paced and I'm used to that. The customers were too chitty chatty with the register people and held the line up.   Anyway, I got a table outside which was nice. The weather was 80 degrees and gorgeous out - so why not sit outside. You put your little number on the salt and pepper shaker thingy and they come over wih your food when it's ready.   Food was very good! Place is big! Indoor and outdoor seating so check it out!",

First off you order the food chipotle style and then you have to play the \"where do I sit??\" game for a while and hope something opens up.  We ended up having to sit on stools along the windows which was really uncomfortable.  Then we proceeded to wait 40 minutes for our food.  The waitress dropped off our food with barely a smile and not any kind of acknowledgment of how long we had to wait.  The food was good but the portions were small.  I ordered the biscuits and Gravy, my wife had the veggie omelet and my little one the chocolate chip griddle.  Again the food was good, though I'm blown away at how amazed people seem to be with the potatoes as they tasted average to me.  Eventually another worker came by and asked how our food was but never waited for our answer as he just pointed out everything we ordered and wandered off before we could even respond.  I wanted to like this place but I will never return here.  Maybe it was an off day I don't know.  I'm not going to waste the time to find out and will stick with The Perk.",

It may not seem that way at first as you order at the counter and they give you a placard to place at your table. You get your own drinks, silverware and condiments. They have a lot of condiments!   Server brings your order to you after you sit, you enjoy your meal. We bussed our own table and then left. Others left their trash because they were Scottsdale 30K millionaires who think the world is there to clean up after them. The place is full of nasty rich types but that's not the staff's fault.  Please leave a tip as the four tables of proper ladies I watched left the poor server nothing (again the world is there for their pleasure).  Dog-friendly too!",

The good thing is you dont have to flag down wait staff for extra napkins or have to hope they come by to refill your drink. Ordered the biscuits and gravy. Once it was brought out I was concerned. The visual was not there instead of white creamy sausage gravy it was a cross between brown and gray. Tasted better then it looked with lots of sausage in it probably adding to the off putting color.  Clean and bright inside. No home fries only potato choice is hash browns finely shredded and sat flat on the plate. Just hash browns nothing special.  Overall tasted good but nothing to look at.

    "text": "There's not too many breakfast places that peak my interest. I'm more of a make my own at home kind of guy, but on those rare occasions when I do venture out I go to Scramble.   Two things that stand out to me the most:  - The presentation of the food  - The outside patio  On Saturday morning, went with a friend of mine. Line was long but goes pretty fast. This is big turn on for me as I hate the long waits I find at more mainstream breakfast oriented restaurants . I just like to sit down and relax in the morning as soon as possible. Decided to go with the Veggie Omelet this time, friend went with a bagel with cream cheese and salmon. We made our way to the outside patio and sat down facing the mountains. Perfect weather this morning had to do it and as stated above one of the reasons why this place gets good marks from me. Food arrived after about 10 minutes which is reasonable, and left good opportunity for conversation with my company.   Veggie omelet came with four slices of whole wheat french toast and potato wedges. I sprinkled some Tapatio hot sauce all around which you can grab at this kiosk type thing on the inside. Omelet was delicious, no complaints there. Potato wedges were also divine, just crisp enough and full of flavor. Hit the spot just right and the portion was also just right. I think this is important. If the food isn't taking up all the space on the plate I don't have the compulsion to eat it all or waste it. It's just a pet peeve of mine and Scramble does a good job of giving just enough to satisfy.   The final point I want to make about Scramble and why it's one of the few places I travel to in this ungodly hour is because you don't get bothered. You buy your food, you grab your utensils/condiments, sit down and the food it brought to you. It's simple. It's easy. And the food is somewhat healthy. My rating is close to a 4.5 only because it's not the best breakfast food I've ever had but the environment and service bring it's close to a 5 star.  With all that said, I would highly recommend Scramble.",

The \"rosemary potatoes\" seemed to be missing rosemary - or salt, pepper, anything with flavor!  The eggs, on the other hand, were fresh and delicious- so just order eggs!  My friend ordered a breakfast pizza with sausage.  It looked and tasted as if it had sat for hours under a warming light.  Had absolutely no flavor at all.  I took a bite and could not begin to tell you what was on it, have never had sausage that tasted just like pizza dough!  I've had better frozen versions.

My boyfriend got a chorizo burrito with the scrambled browns mixed in and that was so good! Some of the best chorizo I've had in awhile! He got yogurt on the side with his and even that was good!

The other shorter girl working didn't seem as nice.  My gouda brizza was quite tasty. Omg was it hot when I bit in though! I was SO hungry I just wanted to devour it. Yeah, wait a second before trying to chow down, ok?  Could the cinnamon roll have any more frosting? Wow! Luckily, I like them smothered in the stuff. They just pile it on & you spread it around.  I want to describe Scramble as fresh, open, clean, bright, & modern.  The counter girl agrees with me that they need more than just the cherry flavored Capri-Sun. She said the parfaits are good too. I'm going to have to try 1 some time.",

The sweetness from the tomato was delicious. The scramble came with rosemary potatoes and toast. Rosemary + crispy potatoes, what's not to love? I decided to skip the toast and add the whole wheat pancakes. When our waitress set my plate down the smell of cinnamon was overwhelming and inviting. They put fresh cinnamon in the pancake batter.   I don't normally eat a large breakfast, but from time to time I will make an exception and visit Scramble. The restaurant is very clean, simply decorated and had good music in the background.",

I can't believe we sat there watching our food get cold on the server bar while the two guys had a conversation, laughed and joked.  If you can't fix the service, at least black out the glass, so I don't have to watch my food sitting there getting old. After an extended time period, the server did come over and apologize because there was an incident with my Eggs Benedict and they were going to have to remake my order.  Guess what?  The other meal we ordered sat there getting even colder. This place had a nice amount of customers coming through the doors and many will not come back if this is the type of service they receive.  I felt sorry for the young lady at the register.  On more than one time I heard her apologizing to customers about different things that were going wrong.

    "text": "I used to frequent this place years and years ago when it was Le Petite Cafe so decided that I might as well try this new place. It's completely gutted from when it was the other restaurant and has a very open but hipster feel to it. The menu is on boards as soon as you walk in and you go further up to place your order with the waitress. Number in hand, you sit anywhere and someone delivers the food when you're ready. I've been to places like that before but it's still a weird concept for a \"sit down\" place. I got the Sunrise Sandwich which is basically runny eggs and ham with cheese on toast and a side of pan-fried rosemary seasoned potatoes. The sandwich was really good with plenty of ham and a lot of flavour but, and I say this as a potato lover, the potatoes were not edible. They were rubbery and flavourless like they had been sitting under a heat lamp all morning. This wouldn't bother me from a place like Denny's but if I'm going to be paying nearly $8 for something I can make at home at a fraction of the cost, I expect high quality and flavour. Also tried the Italian coffee and cinnamon roll. The cinnamon roll was very fluffy and had a good helping of frosting on it. I liked that they didn't melt the frosting over it. The coffee was very good but a little costly at over $2 for self-serve no-frills coffee. Even Starbucks is cheaper than that.   Overall, much left to be desired. Decent food but I've had more satisfying experiences at iHop at much better prices.  I can only assume all the high ratings are from people who aren't super into breakfast like me. It's my favourite meal so I know when it's lacking. I'll continue mourning the loss of the little cute France-themed breakfast joint that was.",

The moment we walked in we were greeted with happy staff people.  I still think it's a tad bit too early to be that happy!  But oh wells, they probably loved their job.  The place was super clean, and quite delightful, and smelled nice.  We ordered and sat down, and the food came out pretty fast.  Their pancakes were amazing, and I don't really eat pancakes.  But they were delicious!!  I had to eat my coworkers because she was stuff, then I ate my supervisor's when she wasn't looking, and I ate her supervisor's as well.  Ate too much that morning, had to use their loo.  Super clean and well kept at the time I used it.  I love the sound of the flush too, like a massive wave crashing down.  More powerful then a common house toilet, but not as powerful as the ones at the mall, perfectly balance.   Overall a great place, and I would definitely come again if I'm ever on that side of town.",

My sourdough was very dry and the eggs were overcooked.  $20 for a California omelette and a drink? $0.75 extra for almond milk? Then they try to force you to tip with a card by hiding the \"no tip\" option. I would much rather go to US Eggs and wait the extra 5 minutes.  TLDR; Decent but basically an overpriced Denny's",

    "text": "We visited Scramble on a Sunday morning that Google advised was their busiest time. We were pleasantly surprised that wasn't the case. There may have been 4 people in front of us online and plenty of seating options.   Unfortunately, that's where the issues began.   Multigrain Pancakes: The flavor of both the pancakes and syrup were good but they were undercooked. The middle of both pancakes were very doughy and mushy.   Sausage Patties: The flavor was slightly above average but they weren't very warm.   Biscuits & Gravy: The biscuits were decent and the gravy had pretty good flavor. But they were both cold which was strange since the plate was very warm.   Hash Browns: These were about average in the flavor end but were definitely overdone causing them to be dark and super crunchy.   The Switch: We asked someone about the biscuits and gravy temp and they gladly took the plate along with the hash browns back to the kitchen. Someone else brought back a new plate of biscuits and gravy but this time with bacon on the side and without the hash browns. We explained we didn't order bacon and the hash browns were our side. He immediately asked if we would like to keep the bacon (which was nice) and went back to the kitchen to get the hash browns. He was very courteous, polite & apologetic. We thought, no worries, they were making our order right.   Round 2: Unfortunately, the 2nd round of biscuits and gravy were similar in temp... Possibly a bit warmer but definitely almost cold. Also, the replacement hash browns were strange. They were some recipe that wasn't offered on the menu. They offer traditional, bacon & sweet potato but these were dripping in oil and heavily doused with garlic something else (possibly rosemary). The gentlemen helping us admitted he didn't know what those hash browns were. We wound up sending the new order back as well.   Service: It took maybe 3 minutes before the young man waiting on us came back with a full refund of our meal. He apologized profusely and said they are usually on top of things but had definitely missed the mark on our meal. He invited us to come back & gave us our refund receipt.   Summary: My guess is we caught them on a bad day. The flavor of the food and customer service definitely warrant a second chance. The atmosphere is nice and casual. I've also heard good things about their burritos so it's a place I'd definitely recommend everyone to give it a try.",

I indulged in the Soyrizo Vegan Burrito except I had it as a scramble because I can't have gluten and the cashier let me sub in tomatoes which was bombtastic. In addition to not being able to eat gluten I have other food restrictions so I don't eat out a lot. For that, I am SO happy to have found scramble. It was honestly the best breakfast I've had in years. The employees were also super nice, helpful and attentive! Yay for customer service not being dead!!   I brunched with my boyfriend and he ordered the Chile Verde Burrito and the Blueberry French toast. He describes his experience at Scramble as a culinary journey of deliciousness and adds, \"it's like the big o in my mouth.\" Hahahaha  We are from out of town, and we can confidently say we will be back for more brunch!   P.S. IF YOU ARE HANGRY - just read this. PHENOMENAL BREAKFAST SERVED ALL DAY.",

I was solo dining and felt very comfortable eating there and hanging out a bit to read.   I got the Western Omelette with egg whites, sweet potato hash (because of a Yelp review), biscuits, a side of bacon and coffee. The omelette was okay, a bit bland and kind of runny, which I ignored just to get through it. Once I added salt and pepper, it was delicious. The bacon wasn't crunchy enough, but that was my fault for not specifying. The hash browns were meh and I didn't eat all of them.

    "text": "I was hoping to find a cozy breakfast place with good bacon, fair prices and a nice warm morning vibe.  Scramble is none of that.  Bright white and  chrome chairs with club  music it feels like a modern European youth place.  I find it annoying that you stand at the counter to give you order and pay ahead of time, where they put a big \"tip\" line on the receipt (for what?), reading off a glass covered 'menu', then get your own drink, table service, napkins & water.   Want ketchup?  Over there on the rack, with the salt & pepper, Tabasco, etc..   Kind of like eating at home, only more expensive.   Very modern / trendy, but very cold.  The young gals working there (can't really call them servers or waitresses) were polite and cute, but there will be all new ones next week, like most Scottsdale eateries.  The food was OK.  Not great, but OK.  Very average bread, cold hard little butter wrappies, white square plates to match the motif.  OJ, serve yourself, not fresh squeezed... watery.    Kudos for having Fox News on the TVs!     Can't really give it more than an average rating and won't go back",

You have to scout for your own table so on a busy day you have to be an expert with the eagle eye and find your table before someone else does.  Food was really good - I had the eggs benedict and an orange juice.  The service was nice considering how busy they were.  I would definitely come back again.",

In my previous reviews I go on and on about the Toluca breakfast pizza and was dismayed as it seem to be getting less fantastic every time I stopped in. To the point of not recommending it anymore to anyone. Did it stop me from checking in? No. I'm glad I kept checking.   At least a half dozen in a row over the last few months have been great. I'm so happy!  Special notice regarding customer service: Stacy rocks! She's is the kind of employee that keeps a business going and customers coming in. She gives a damn and works hard. I believe she might be responsible for the triumphant return of the Toluca! She always asks me how it is and is actually interested in my answer. Thanks Stacy!",

Sigh, I thought it was around Glendale and it wasn't... it's way way north.  I could almost touch the Pointe at Tapatio, and was about to turn around when I saw it's big bright sign.   Okay, yay!  Breakfast.  I was hungry by then. So I go in, and, sigh... I have to stand and study the big plastic menu boards, very similar to Pei Wei's... mix and match, each item priced individually, pick an omelette and add some sides of your choice.... sigh, it's a chain.  Or if it's not a chain they decided that looking like a chain was the way to go.  Not for me. Interior is uber clean, give 'em that. Kinda too efficient, too slick.   Midcentury modern styling with the Toledo aluminum chairs, cool colors and styling - they got it goin' on in that way.  But for breakfast, I just wanna sit down and order off a menu.   This is that \"fast casual\" style where you order at the counter and they'll give you a number you clip to a stand at your table.  Service was friendly.   The food was good.  I had a veggie omelette, rosemary potatoes and some pancakes. Oh they blew it with the syrup.  Yes I'm a syrup snob.   Aunt Jemima fans:  don't ever, ever try real maple syrup from Vermont because you can never use that thick gloppy fake syrup again.   Yes, Scramble serves that thick, gloppy fake syrup stuff.  The pancakes were just a little less than \"okay\" - a little too rubbery, a little too thick, a little too dry, and got cold fast.   And that icky fake syrup doesn't help.  Anyway, this place is okay, but I wouldn't ever go back because it was a looooong drive for me.   I'll stick with my faves: Matt's Big Breakfast, Over Easy, and I'll keep mourning the loss of my beloved Palatte.  Sigh.",

If you are a fan of eggs benedict I would recommend this dish.  My husband had the Tocula pizza.  Which was very savory.  The menu indicated the pizza was spicy but the spice was more derived from the chorizo and a little kick of jalapeno.  Not as spicy as expected and very good.  On top of the delicious meal we recieved a frequent visitor card which gave us 10% off, which we can use on our future visits.  I'm not sure if everyone gets one of those cards or how it works.  Definitely try Scramble if you want Breakfast that is above ordinary.  We can't wait to go there again!",

The inside of the building is super clean and that trendy/modern/chic style that we've been seeing lately.  They had about every type of tobasco ever invented on the condiment bar.

It is a very nice, clean and considering the size of the room a very quiet place.  We happen to enjoy being able to order of a simple menu at the counter and very quickly finding our way to a table,  The food great and the service was friendly.  I thoroughly enjoyed my French Toast and my husband loved his Eggs Benedict.  The place was fresh and clean.  Simply decorated too!  We sat near the kitchen service area and never heard any noise....as well as the piped in music was the perfect level....no one had to raise their voices to be heard!  We look forward to going there again someday....unfortunately we were only visiting.",

It adds a bit of flare with it's college hip atmosphere (although at times thrown off by the families and senior citizens, but hey....they're all cool too!) into the border of Sunnyslope and Moon Valley.  The food is a wonderful fusion of classic/southwest and it is all as healthy as it can be (come on, how healthy can sausage and loads of butter be?).  If you sit out on the patio, your reward will be a beautiful of Sunnyslope with the mountain preserve as your backdrop, and a nice sunrise to lighten the whole thing up if you make it early enough.  Definitely one of the best breakfast/brunch places in the North Valley.  Hopefully this catches on..............",

A guy in a black shirt walked passed carrying food looked over, smiled, and said good morning. I placed my order and started towards a table Cherri smiled and said good morning.

We were looking for a breakfast spot close to our hotel and the reviews for this place looked good. This restaurant is fast casual. You order at a register, similar to a place like Pei Wei, get a number and find a table. I ordered the Brizza which is a breakfast pizza with Gouda and Applewood Smoked Bacon. The wife had the breakfast burrito with chorizo.  The kids wanted oatmeal, and we got the smalls for them. The food was brought out by a cheerful server, the rest like silverware and beverages are self serve. The food was delicious. The Brizza was awesome and definitely tasted like breakfast. My wife loved her burrito, which had nice spice but was not overwhelming. The kids were happy. My only knock on the place like others have mentioned was the drink prices. Everything was $2.50 to $3.00, which took our bill for four north of $40 which is bordering on the hotel prices. Overall excellent food quality and enjoyable atmosphere. High recommend from me.",

I love the meat scramble and the brizza-very tasty.  It gets crazy busy on the weekends. We went as a large group on a Sunday-eek, got stuck having to sit outdoors which would be fine, if it weren't August in Phoenix. This can sometimes make me think twice about going-the line can go out the door!!  The seating can be limited when it's busy, so keep that in mind.  Kid friendly with nice kid options too, and they get a little kids packet thing to play with.  Plenty of high chairs!",

The food came out fast but the taste was just ok and I felt I paid too much money for it; at least the Americano coffee was the best part of my meal.  So I thought ok let me give the \"popular item\", the cinnamon roll, a chance.  That was a disappointment since the frosting was cream cheese and I had to scrape off the mountain of it.  I suggest they notate on the menu that the cinnamon roll comes with cream cheese frosting since they typically come with vanilla icing. Over all the customer service better than the food.",

The place was packed, but since it's an order at the counter, take your number to the table place, there was no problem finding a spot on their sunny-yet-shaded patio.  I appreciate that it's semi-self serve, because that means I can refill my coffee as much as I want and grab any condiments I want (Cholula! Varieties of Tabasco! Ketchup!), but I think the price-point is a little steep for this type of service. Almost $50 for 4 at breakfast? I dunno. Seemed a little ridiculous.  {Side note: What irked the HELL out of me was watching people bark at the food runners to go back in multiple times for silverware, napkins, etc. GET IT YOURSELF. IT'S RIGHT IN FRONT OF YOUR FACE WHILE YOU FILL YOUR SODA. THESE PEOPLE ARE CLEARLY BUSY. YOU ARE LAZY.}  My omelet had a really tasty combo of roasted veggies, and I loved the way the zingy sun dried tomatoes played off the fresh mozzarella. The roasted rosemary potatoes were tasty enough, although Wildflower's are better in my opinion. Toast was toast. Get your choice of jellies when you go pick up your own silverware and napkins, because you are not a dick and can do it yourself.  The place was slammed by the time we left, but all the staff was still as smiley as can be. I just can't get past that price point though. If we were back in the area and hungry, I'd certainly try it again...just with someone else footing the bill.",

I liked the pancakes a little bit better. Just the right amount of food for 2!  By the way, there were some vegan options on the menu online and the take out menus but not on the boards posted inside the place.   Normally I would give 4 stars for a place with food this healthy and also good, but I was not wowed by the overall experience. First and foremost, it took forever for anything to come out - can't remember exactly how long but I remember thinking it was way too long for 2 simple plates. Even the coffee took forever to come out! The other thing is that it felt like I was sitting in a chain restaurant, which wasn't bad, but nothing special and probably contributed to the wait dragging on so long - nothing interesting about being there.   Overall I would recommend to folks looking for a healthy breakfast, but would not necessarily choose this over other great brunch options if you are visiting and trying to hit the best places in PHX.",

I got this thing and was like, \"Ah, no's. Don't like.\" Basically it comes down to this. The pizza crust was too bready. It dried my mouth out and I couldn't taste nothing for days mang.

It was very crowded but things moved fast there and the staff was super friendly.   I couldn't decide between 2 eggs anyway or the pancakes, come to find out I could get my 2 eggs and sub my toast for the choc chip dollar pancakes. Score. My bf got the meat lovers' scramble with toast. We grabbed a table and they delivered the food fairly quickly. It got a bit tight in the seating area and people were taking chairs and grabbing them for themselves, leaving other tables without. A little frantic but the food was good. AND they had the Women's World Cup on. Bonus!  A great neighborhood place. Maybe I'll check out the sports bar and burger place in that plaza as well.",

Food was solid but nothing extraordinary. Would go back if I was in the area again.",

If I'm going to pay this price, I expect good food... maybe even great food.  If this place had been better I probably would have gone here weekly.  But the fact that it was one of the few decent Sunnyslope options, and I went here twice in 5 years, says something.  I don't know what it is, but everything in this little subdivision is run by related family members, as far as I know.  And interestingly enough, despite them being genuinely nice people, it's all of mediocre quality and over priced items.  Look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Scramble is great! I highly recommend doing an early morning hike at North Mountain, then heading straight there for breakfast. If you don't make it there before nine or so on weekends, the line will be pretty long, but don't worry, it moves fast. Once you get inside, the decor is simple and modern, with a bright, clean, open space and plenty of seating. There's also a nice patio when the weather is good. This is an order at the counter, get your own drinks, and seat yourself style place. Pretty awesome concept for a breakfast place, in my opinion. You can help yourself to your own coffee (they have a few different roasts and a variety of creamers) and hot sauce (great variety, though, sadly, lacking Sriracha).   Everything on the menu looks so tasty that it's pretty tough to decide what to try, and so far everything I've ordered has been really good. My favorites are the veggie scramble (sun dried tomatoes, squash, peppers, & cheese with a side of rosemary potatoes and toast - really delicious toast) and any of their brizzas (breakfast pizza - fresh dough, scrambled egg, and toppings like sausage, chorizo, Gouda, &c). Just go ahead and try anything, I really don't think you can go wrong.",

    "text": "Quality food is the thing that stands out the most to me for this place. They do a great job of emphasizing flavor and/or spice in their food and that it is food that doesn't just fill and exhaust the eater, but rather energizes and refreshes.  Some things I love about this place: 1) The quality of their food as I just said. My favorite is their breakfast burritos. 2) The gourmet coffee station where you can get as many refills as you want when you want. 3) The way they streamline the ordering and seating process, which is usually a drudgery at other places. Here you order at the counter, choose your own seat and a waitress will bring you your food and check in with you at least a couple times to make sure there are no issues and that's it. 4) I like their use of windows letting in the natural sun light into the place. It makes for a pleasant and natural dining experience. 5-ish) I like that I can watch whatever game is on there, but as much as I like sports, they seem to have too many TV's. I mean they don't have to be everywhere and sometimes I want to get away from the tv and be in real life.   The reason I don't give Scrambles 5 stars is the bill ends up being a little spendier than I like. I don't think it's overpriced, but it still doesn't change the bottom line when it comes to my budget. Other than that it's great!",

    "text": "I can remember when this place had just barely opened.  No one knew what and who they were and coupons were provided in the local ads for their breakfast.  That QUICKLY changed, but I know understand why.  This used to be a quick hop and jump away from my old apartments.  My fiance and I visited nearly every weekend and sampled a variety of items on the menu.  Each time we went back, it kept getting busier and busier.  So, to beat the crowds, be sure to arrive early (i.e. before church gets out or the morning hikers are done).  When it comes to breakfast, I am pretty basic.  I don't need anything fancy to satisfy my taste, although I am partial to greasy flavored food.  Our last visit went smoothly and quickly.  I ordered the 2 egg special with bacon and rosemary potatoes and an ice tea to drink.  My fiance ordered the chorizzo (sp?) burrito which also came with the rosemary potatoes and an ice tea to drink.    ALL THINGS ICE TEA:  I am a huge fan of ice tea.  I don't like the crap out of the pump, nor do I like any sugar in it.  They serve FRESH ice tea in multiple flavorings to soothe your palette and quench your thirst.    FOOD:  I love their bacon!  It never comes out under or over cooked and always has this deliciously wholesome taste to it.  I also am not a big fan of eggs, so when I do order them, scrambled is the way to go.  The last serving I got were moist, fluffy, and not over/under cooked.  Perfectly whipped to perfection!  The potatoes had the right amount of crispiness and flavoring added.  What a delicacy for my breakfast palette.  The only down side to Scramble is how far they are located to my new place.  However, anytime I am in the neighborhood I make it a point to stop in for breakfast.",

Heard about the Scramble in Sunnyslope on 7th street so it was convenient and we went there. Monday morning around 10:30. Everything was the polar opposite, her eggs were over well done  yokes dried and burned. She ordered medium. Hasbrowns were similar way over cooked. Butter was in wrapper on food. Who knows were they were before. Toast was bread not toasted . Bacon was clumped together and also over cooked. Staff was not friendly and the water was terrible. Coffee was fine. Place seemed dirty. Tables with stuff left newspapers left and it smelled like someone was smoking. I was embarrassed to have recommended the Place. I went back to Scottsdale out of curiosity and it was good. So don't judge your Scramble  just find the location with the right management and <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchef.in&s=4cf568d6591e617c1e9915c284bc4c9f4ddae7a7391ac8183ecea6d8f05f6362\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chef.in</a> place first and go back there only.

Scramble has all the options down pat, they've even got 4 vegan breakfast entrees, some great loose leaf teas, fresh made OJ, soy milk, various flavors of hot sauces and more. Their outdoor patio is rad. They're pet and kid friendly. I also highly appreciate the fact that they use separate cookware and plates for their vegan dishes.  My biggest problem with Scramble is their consistency. The food just doesn't come out the same way every time.  My first visit to try the tofu/soyrizo burrito resulted in a burrito that was extra oily and sweet potato hash that was blackened (burnt) and extra oily.  My next visit (today) resulted in a burrito with tofu that wasn't cooked/seasoned as well as the last time (big chunks of white tofu). The sweet potato hash was good this time.  I'd also like to see a bit more soyrizo added to the burritos.  The miniature cup of salsa provided with these dishes should also be increased in size, as it's easy to run through in a few bites.  I still really dig the place, I just hope that they get their cooking/prep down so that the dishes turn out more consistent and better.  I'd also like to see a vegan Brizza (breakfast pizza) added to the menu (with tofu instead of egg).",

The food at Scramble, however, is worth mentioning.  I read about Scramble in Phoenix Magazine.  Turns out I have driven past it many times and never knew it existed.  Very happy to have picked up that issue (I don't read it on a regular basis).    Their Santa Fe style Eggs Benedic was great.  It's served with ham on jalapeno  corn bread and covered with a chipotle hollandaise sauce.  Rosemary potatoes are served on the side.  It wasn't as spicy as I hoped it would be but it was delicious.    The Costa burrito is also worth a mention as is the salsa it was served with.  One minor beef I have with Scramble is overpriced beverages.  It's a sacrifice I am willing to make.  When the food is quality I won't hold above average drink prices against Scramble.  Give Scramble a shot.  You'll be back.",

That said, sometimes I just don't feel like whipping out the griddle so we do find ourselves going for breakfast at times. Most of the time we stick to Waffle House or Bill Johnson's because, well... we LIKE them and we don't have to sit in line for four hours like you do over at Matt's Big Breakfast (what the heck is that about anyway, can eggs be this good? I'll never find out, I can't stand lines - especially at breakfast).  Last time we were at Il Posto we saw this place right next door and although it looks more like an IKEA store than a breakfast joint, we said we'd make a point of visiting it next time we were jonesing for breakfast, and we did.   I really wanted to hate this place because it looks so trendy but darn it if it wasn't perfectly delicious. I can't even complain about their coffee because it was dark and rich, just like I like it. Service was quick and friendly. If I had one complaint about the place, it would be that the second you walk in the door, if you're unfamiliar with their menu you're UNDER PRESSURE TO DECIDE immediately because the knobs in line behind you already know what they want so GO GO GO... but that's a fairly minor issue. I had the veggie omelette and the wife had the French toast. We both agreed that it was delicious and we'll definitely be back!",

I see him go check with the manager and the manager grabs one that had obviously been sitting on the counter and brings it to me, TWENTY minutes after I requested a replacement for the cold one!  At this point I said that I'd just like my money back. He asks for the receipt, which has already been taken away by the server - so he says how about a free entree for next time, no there won't be a next time!

Last time I went with my Aunt, Mother, and Grandmother and had shared with them (and after my Grandma opened the topic to the bus-gal), that I was annoyed they used so much Styrofoam and other wasteful products. I believe last time the only way to not use non-recyclable dishware and utensils was to bring your own. This time, they still had disposable drink cups but I was very happy to see they were now a light plastic. I was soooo happy!  I got an egg sandwich, minus the ham and on a enflish muffin rather than sourdough bread. It was fantastic! Like a dream in my mouth. Cooked to perfection! I could've easily shared this with another diner, which was my first thought, but after one bite I just couldn't stop. Loved it.  My only one criticism is the employee who greeted us and took our order wasn't very warm or welcoming. She cut me off like 3 times and repeated things in a very annoyed tone. Hey, it's not my fault you are hung over and work at a breakfast place.  Overall, I'm glad I gave it a second chance.",

    "text": "Breakfast food an I have become good friends since I realized I was lactose intollerant. For some reason I have been eating a lot more eggs since cutting out dairy. So, a friend and I took a drive down from the resort we were staying at. We found scramble at the recommendation of some friends. I'm glad we went.  Nothing beats a fresh, hot, delicious egg scrambled full of veggies and bacon. This accented with small wheat pancakes and crispy potatoes is a sure hit. The breakfast blend coffee was great. My friend is allergic to dairy, wheat and doesn't eat meat. She was able to come out of there with quite a spread. This was truly a morning miracle.  I have to say that scramble has increased the quality of my friendship with breakfast. It was one of the best breakfast places I have visited. And they utilize local, fresh ingredients which only adds to the experience. If you go and you have a dog, they can come along too. Another added bonus. They do close at 2pm though.",

Whenever going to a restaurant, I look for the same thing in return and can always find this here. When you first walk in, you are greeted from the cashier, this morning being Destiny who was so upbeat and knows how to carry a positive conversation. After a little mix up with our food (being brought it in a to-go and then the wrong food) the manager, Lorraine comped the whole entire thing after introducing herself and checking up on the meal... WHICH WAS SCRAM-DILUMCIOUS:D Wonderful way to start the day. My girlfriend and I will be returning soon, thank you for reading:)",

    "text": "It's east to see what it's trying to be, but it misses.   First, the design. It's very hip, with its brushed steel and clean lines, counter around the periphery with power outlets and free WiFi. The easy menu is presented mounted in large sheets of glass. The staff are cool and friendly and accommodating.   It took a long time to choose our breakfast because there were so many intriguing options on the menu. The food we got tasted pretty good, but there wasn't any excuse for so much of it being cold (mid-morning, not crowded). The signature rosemary potatoes? An English muffin? Really? The omelet was stellar and the biscuits and gravy were yummy (though extra salty). The fried eggs were overcooked, despite the VERY detailed explanatory poster (explaining the spectrum of subtlety in egg doneness) that hangs next to the ordering station. I knew what I wanted, ordered same, and got a couple of degrees more done than that. (If you're going to make a big deal about the finesse of your egg frying technique, you'd better deliver every time.)  They had made too many parfaits that morning and comped us one, which was tasty--but would have been better with fresh fruit instead of compote.  They automatically lose a star for having conversation-hostile televisions (though my bride wants it noted that they were all on different channels, so one could choose one's interest and find something to watch). Another half star gone because if the ambient music. Techno on a Thursday morning?  We may go back, but we're only here for a week and there are other options available.",

First off just walking in was a disappointment cause you can't sit down and check out the menu thoroughly you order right as you walk in. My husband is handicapped and has a hard time standing for any period of time. So of course he ordered the first thing he spotted he might like steak and eggs, eggs over easy steak med rare. I order eggs Benny and our grandson ordered kids pancakes. Have to get your own utensils napkins condiments and your drinks. Then sit down finally.They bring your food out.      Well steak well done hash browns over cooked which my husband likes that way, but mine were over done too they were crunchy. My eggs were perfect but everything else was over done ham and English muffins were burnt around the edges. Anyway manager got wind of husband's over cooked steak and gave us a card for a free entree when we return. Not returning so have a free entree for anybody who wants it. Even our grandson (who is 10)didn't eat but a couple of bites of his pancakes but he loved the bacon.   So here's a couple of stars for good bacon and eggs cooked perfectly.",

    "text": "So we took a gamble when selecting Scramble so please forgive my Scramble ramble. Ugh. So much potential. Friendly staff. But so so food and though friendly, an untrained staff. Upon entering I like the open and airy room. I like the railing along the east wall with great views of the mountains. But. Wait. What are all these people standing in line for? The host I'm sure. WTF? It's an order at the counter sit down with a number on your table kinda place. Ugh again. Not my thing. Like camping. Or hiking. Or that second Narnia movie.   I'm with two people and they are ordering up their grub. Scanning the menu. Asking some questions. At one point my friend was ordering a blended coffee drink. The shelves behind the cashier were loaded with frape type powders. I couldn't believe I heard her say \"Oh. Yeah. I don't know how to make those!\" LMAO. I had grabbed some bottled Vitamin water so I was in the clear on potentially prepared beverage fiasco.   When we sat the food arrived in a timely manner. Pancakes and sausage for me. Same for my friend. My other friend had the breakfast burrito and a cinnamon roll. My side of eggs came out quickly afterward.   I'm starving so I'm diving in to the fluffy (actually doughy) pancakes. I prefer a thinner flapjack with some slightly crispy edges. Sausages. Much like Phyllis Dillers's hoo haa..well...sadly they were dry. And I purposely ordered pork sausage cuz I wasn't in the mood for turkey.   Now. I'm noticing my friend TRYING to cut up his pancakes. I cut as I go. But he likes to get everything all chopped up apparently. Now he's a big guy. It was hysterical seeing him trying to cut through those DOUGHY pancakes. He gave up midway. Needless to say neither one of us finished our cakes.   Lastly he realized as he scanned his check that his omelette he ordered didn't come out because it wasn't even listed on the bill.   So Scramble. You got potential kid. I felt the heart in the room. Just didn't get much from the brain.",

    "text": "I do not for the life of me get the hype for this place other than its clean an modern in appearance. It's not like most breakfast restaurants where a waitress come to your table then returns when you need more coffee. This is a order at the register have food brought out to you and self serve coffe station. Not that this is bad just different than traditional. My problem was with the food itself. After driving by this place numerous times and deciding not to stand in line we finally were there early enough to get right in to see what all this excitement is about. I ordered the Califonia omelet. It came out in a reasonable amount of time but the omelet had two spinach leaves and 5 tiny specks of meat with very little cheese. There was a nice avacodo garnish but I was basically eating eggs which I'm not a particular fan of without the meat and veggies. I mixed the hash browns in to offer more flavor which was more than I bargained for because all hash browns are smothered in pepper. It's possible based on other reviews that I just got a bad plate but honestly I have no intention of hitting this place up again when there are MUCH better breakfast joints all over that aren't maybe quite as stylish but I'll get what my stomach desires. 2 miles North is Moon Valley cafe which is low on ambience but extremely high on food quality and price. I'll gladly drive the extra miles.",

I was with a group and there were no cleared tables for 4 so we had to ask to have a table cleared for us. They did get one cleared fairly quickly though. They seemed understaffed on the whole, I think I counted 4 people working in the whole restaurant. Just didn't make the best first impression but hopefully this was a fluke. I will try this place again for sure because again the food was excellent.",

I ordered the Brizza (breakfast pizza) which was fun, tastily prepared and well presented.  I liked their menu selection, upbeat (yet relaxed) atmosphere, free WIFi (a must for meetings these days) and the self-serve free re-fills on bevies.  Our meeting was running a bit long so I went back in and got a choc chip cookie after my zesty, savory chorizo Brizza.  It was just OK.  Nothing to write to Mrs. Tollhouse about, but not bad and fresh-baked today so it didn't taste like Saran wrap.    The young woman at the counter was super helpful and helped me carry drinks outside for our table and bussed our table expeditiously as we were having a meeting which I appreciated. Everyone was super nice and it just had a great, chill, mellow, happy breakfasty vibe.    I'd like to take friends there sometime if they ever come out to AZ to visit.  Considering our current state politics, that's pretty unlikely in the near future, so I suppose it's up to us locals to keep supporting awesome little AZ finds like Scramble.",

    "text": "Loved everything about this place. Service was quick and very friendly, the food was TO DIE FOR, prices were very fair, and the ambiance was fun! It's set up cafeteria-style, but that doesn't bother me at all! Order food, get your number, wait for food. Simple, easy, no big deal. It wasn't incredible busy when we got there just before noon, but was \"line out the door\" as we left. However, There were plenty of open tables around the joint.  I ordered the chicken bacon panini and with every bite, it got better and better! The bread was toasty but soft on the inside, the chicken had great seasoning, the boursin and jack cheese combo was out of this world, and bacon is ..well, bacon.   The hubs ordered the biscuits and gravy, and he practically licked his plate clean.   We will be returning as soon as possible! LOVED it!",

    "text": "I finally went to scramble, it was quite the scramble this morning for the staff since they were down a grill.  I had to explain to people in the line that he gal said \"down a grill\" not \"a girl\" as they were saying, can't they call a back up girl in??  HAHA- kinda funny.  Anyhow, down a grill must have sucked for them and for all of us in line that went out the door, but it did move quickly, the line moved quicker than the food arrived, but they did tell us while we waited in line, that it would be at least 25 minutes for food.  I was with a good friend who I wanted to catch up with so we didn't care and it didn't seems like it made anyone get out of line and leave either.   We ordered, it's basically everything any breakfast place would have.  They have the drink station in the middle, get you liquids and condiments yourself.  I'm cool with that, I kinda liked it b/c I would rather just grab what I want rather than have to keep asking.  Ketchup, hot sauce, more napkins, drink refills whatever- do get it yourself is fine with me.   My friend had the meat lovers omelet, she was into it.  It was a lot of food.  I had the gringo burrito and a cinnamon roll.  I was a bit disappointed with the cinnamon roll. since the reviews made it sound like it was so great.  Mine was dry, I only ate a quarter of it.  Brought the rest home.  I'm staring at it and considering just throwing the darn thing away.  Why waste all those calories?   We hung out for way longer than normal people do since we were catching up and they were cool with it so that was nice.  There was a nice variety of people there too.  Something about it made me like the place even more.  A table next to us was a family with teenage children, they held hands and said prayer before they ate, the table on the other side was a really hot same sex couple, behind were super fit people who must have just finished hiking b/c they looked like it and I bet they ordered egg white and fruit or oatmeal.  I like it, it had a good vibe.  The patio looked inviting too but hell, it's already too hot to go outside, so I have no interest in that area.",

The place is spotless, clean and offers your morning addictions from CNN to sports to 90s reruns. Throw in a latte, loyalty card and a smile and I'm sold.

    "text": "Methinks Yelp outta have the ability to scramble 3 and 4 stars to yield 3 1/2.  Scramble has a lot going for it.  I like the idea that it's brought a bit of new life to the Sunnyslope area.  It's great when a business sees potential for growth in an area others may not.  It's also got a clean, mod decor and local sourced products.  More wins for us all!  Four stars!  When it comes to the food, I wasn't especially impressed.  I ordered the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict (eggs, Jalapeno corn bread, cured ham & chipotle hollandaise) and while it was good, the only flavor standout was the cured ham.  It came with a side of just-above-room-temperature rosemary potatoes and while I could SEE a few specks of rosemary, I couldn't TASTE any rosemary.  While delivering the The Gouda Brizza (Eggs, smoked Gouda & applewood bacon) carryout order I placed for a friend, the aroma wafting through the car made me wonder if I'd made the wrong choice from the menu.  As it turns out, maybe I didn't.  I'm told it was OK for flavor, but the crust looked and tasted like a glorified cracker and there was no discernible flavor of gouda.  The service was fine, but could use a little more pep, considering people are there to jump start their day.  Three stars.  I can't say I'm completely disappointed in Scramble, but it could step it up a small notch when it comes to flavor/texture and price.  Breakfast pizza hasn't really caught on in PHX the way it has on the east coast.  Back east an entire (full size) breakfast pizza can be purchased for little more than the personal size available at Scramble.  Then again, price is soon forgotten when quality is the star.",

This is a spot with modern decor, a simple menu, and fresh flavors. How can you not love a spot with quotes on the wall like this one?  \"It may be the cock that crows, but it is the hen that lays the eggs.\" Margaret Thatcher  Heck yeah! They had a hen in the back droppin' some bomb eggs on our plates and they were oh so tasty.  For our first time visit we decided to try the Veggie Lovers Scramble. We loved the Veggie Lovers Scramble. The Veggie Lovers Scramble includes eggs scrambled with bell peppers, sun dried tomatos, and cheese. The eggs are served with rosemary potatoes and four slices of some freakin' tasty toast. Did I already say tasty? Sure did, and I'll say it again. This food was flippin' tastay!!!  While enjoyin' our tasty food, we found ourselves next to someone else who was also a first time visitor. He was throwin' down on some biscuits and gravy. He said that he hadn't had biscuits and gravy since the 70's, and he felt like he was right at home when he ate from his plate. Any food that transports you back to you childhood is alright with me. Remember that flashback moment that the critic had in Ratatouille? I think our new neighbor at Scramble was having a similar experience.  Portions were a nice size, and the staff was friendly. This is a nice brunch spot. We're more than likely eating brunch there tomorrow. Get there early if you are going on the weekend, this spot is usually packed.",

I mean, if my boyfriend was with me we'd be talking about it just like the yound couple was. They were actually kidding about it - calling it business casual uniform.

The food is not the typical eggs and potatoes breakfast...its hyped up by a wonderful combination of fresh seasoning, vegetables, and cheese!    I've taken out-of-towners here over the past year and when they come back they request Scramble for breakfast at least once during their stay.  The atmosphere is casual and modern.  My husband and I really love to eat outside when it's cool enough.    Overall, the food is great but the prices are kind of up there for breakfast (estimate $25+ for a breakfast and beverage for 2).

They have 5 options for vegan breakfast, and also vegan pancakes which were not advertised but apparently there. They seem to know what they are doing as well, all the vegan meals come out on different color plates then non-vegan meals, which is somehow comforting. The staff was very friendly and totally accommodating. The place is cute, more cafeteria style and laid back which is perfect for a morning breakfast. Sitting outdoors was great, there is a beautiful view of the mountains. Overall, I would say this is a new Phoenix favorite for me!",

I have tried many different things on the menu and have not been disappointed yet. The last time we went I had their wonderful french toast. If you have not tried the french toast I highly recommend it, We make french toast at home but it is nothing compared to this it is dipped in a vanilla custard and is out of this world. I also love the southwest burrito tons of avocado and just the right amount of spice. Another reason I love scramble is it is kid and dog friendly! My daughter who is six and not a big fan of food loves scramble too she like the pancakes which come in several different flavors and the cinnamon rolls ( soooo good!). Not many restaurants allow pets so I think it is awesome that scramble does they even offer water bowls which is nice since it can get hot :) So if you're looking for a new breakfast place to try please go to scramble you will not be disappointed and if you're not in the mood for breakfast they have tasty lunch options as well!",

However, my last experience will likely keep me away for good. With only one person taking breakfast orders, it took about 10 minutes to get to the counter. Scramble is one of the few places in the area that has more than one vegan option and I went for the vegan veggie scramble. While waiting, I found a seat in the too-close-for-comfort dining area and unsuccessfully tried to connect to the free wi-fi. I decided to move to the \"bar\" area (after extricating my flip flop from a blob of syrup that had cemented my foot to the floor), hoping to get a bit more space, but the stools are bolted to the ground and are so high my feet dangled (and I am not a short person). I moved yet again only to look up to see Fox News on the tv - not exactly what I want to see anytime of the day, let alone when I am eating! My food arrived quickly, but the aroma of the rosemary on the sweet potato hash was enough to make my stomach turn, not to mention it looked like a large hockey puck. The tofu scramble was edible only after being doused in hot sauce. The sourdough toast was good, but they do bread-type things well here, so that was no surprise. Bad food, no wi-fi, sticky floors and Fox News = disappointing breakfast.",

Great atmosphere...just an all around great place.  We were in from LA for a baseball game and wanted a non-chain local place and found this place on Yelp.  Glad we went!",

    "text": "My wife and I had a late breakfast at Scramble earlier this morning. We live nearby and passed by it countless times, but this was our first time stopping in. The first surprise was the restaurant does not offer traditional waiter service. You order and pay when you arrive, and the food is brought to your table when it's ready. Technically speaking, it's fast food. Our food arrived promptly, and my wife's initial reaction was her omelet was the best she ever had. The potatoes that came with my biscuits and sausage gravy were delightful. However, the biscuits themselves were just okay, and the sausage gravy was merely so-so. The contemporary atmosphere was mostly pleasant, although the numerous televisions were a distraction. The place is definitely not cheap. With one breakfast entree and one beverage each, we paid about $22 for the two of us. It might be good for an occasional splurge with out-of-town guests, but it certainly won't become a regular breakfast joint.",

    "text": "I have been wanting to try Scramble for a while - being excited about having a new breakfast place in the neighborhood.   I went this morning with two others who also had not been there. We all were very disappointed. It is pretty close to fast food, but the prices were along the line of a regular sit down, full service restaurant. The only service you get is they bring you your food - everything else is self serve.    All of this wouldn't be so bad if the food was great - but sorry to say it was not. I  had eggs benedict - the WORST I have ever had -$8. It first came to me with the egg pretty much raw - the white  part was all clear like it looks when you first crack the egg open. I had to take it back myself to the order desk. The person was very nice though. I waited a while - the others I  was with were now half way done and I had to ask someone about my meal. Someone brought it to me - only this time it was way overdone - the yolk was very hard. I then asked for the manager - he apologized and then had it redone. This time the egg part was correct. However I have to say also the hollandaise sause was not good - very thick. The other two with me each had a cheese omelette. Neither cared for it much. One had hash browns - very average - and one had bacon - kind of too smokey. One had the Jalapeno Corn Bread which was good. I had a side of  dollar pancakes - and honestly I make better ones with Aunt Jemima mix.  This was a lot like cafeteria food.   The manager did not deduct anything for my eggs benedict problem, but instead gave me a card to come back for a free eggs benedict. I'm thinking - No Thank You!!!",

    "text": "Scramble indeed. Scramble away from this place and into your neighborhood IHOP or Village Inn...at least you'll pay less for equally dismal food. I expected so much more from a new neighborhood place, especially one that's gotten some good reviews and publicity. First of all, I like the system of ordering at the counter for casual lunch and dinner places, but there's something about breakfast that it's ill-suited for. Breakfast is just a full service kind of meal, at least to me. The decor/design is certainly nice and modern, but I wish the food matched. With the exception of their \"brizzas\" (breakfast pizzas), their menu items are the kinds of basic things you'd find at any chain (actually, there's less selection than many chains). We tried the pancakes (we asked for 2 buttermilk and one multigrain) with carmelized bananas. They brought out the pancakes first and then said the bananas would just be a couple minutes. When they finally brought it out, it was one banana halved and carmelized, for three large pancakes - terrible presentation. The pancakes themselves were no better than IHOP. The eggs benedict was equally disappointing - they were served in an ocean of hollandaise sauce, the ham was a tad too salty, and the english muffins were soggy. Originally, I thought of trying one of the \"brizzas\" since they're unique to this place, but I'm glad I didn't. The woman next to me was eating one - it was basically eggs and cheese on a raw-looking flat dough. She didn't appear to be enjoying it at all, picking the eggs off and leaving the dough. I guess I'll be sticking to The Breakfast Club when I do breakfast out.",

Wait in a very long line to order your food, then hope you find a table before it's ready and the server comes to try to find your number.  What if there aren't any tables available, or you're stuck in the sun, with a baby or next to barking dogs on the patio?   Oh well!  They have your money and why should they care if you eat it or not?  I don't like that kind of pressure and having to rely on jackwagon Joe Public to be conscious of others waiting.    Sure this is the VEGAN spot for all vegans in the valley and if you don't mind the stress of the waiting in line, finding a table and battling for a good seat, then by all means; but it's not for everyone.   Fairly expensive for a breakfast spot. Most is a la carte. There is a very messy and sticky beverage station where you get your, flatware, coffee, tea, soda and water.  Wait staff is too far above doing anything other than bringing your food but they will drop and scurry off with a smile.",

The staff are very friendly and helpful. We tried the gouda brizza the first time around. This pizza was amazing! It had the right amount of toppings. I've been missing breakfast pizza ever since I moved here from South Dakota (Casey's breakfast pizza will always be the best pizza, there is no competition).  The second time we tried the French French toast and chocolate chip pancakes. The french toast was one of the best I've had. They dip it in vanilla custard which gives it great flavor. I dont really like french toast but I would eat this again. The pancakes were nice and fluffy though the batter wasn't all the way cooked through in the middle. Still very tasty. I liked that they use mini chocolate chips. We also tried the applewood bacon. It was thicker cut with the sweet/smokey flavor of the applewood and was cook to just the right crispiness. Overall, this is a great place for breakfast and I will be back to try the rest of the menu!",

Lol sometimes I think it's just for show.  Anyhow, The only thing I don't like about this place is that dogs are allowed on the patio where you eat. It's a bit unsanitary in my opinion.  I know there are people who will go on and on about animals being cleaner, but who cares. If you can't be without Fido, take it to go maybe. I like dogs, but eating with them is another story.",

My husband with the Vegan Soyrizo Burrito with the sweet potato hash. The hash was disappointing - more mash than hash, if you will. Crisping it up would be ideal. The burrito was also ok - nothing that wowed the tastebuds.  I always appreciate when restaurants - especially those that serve breakfast - have dedicated vegan items.

    "text": "Was craving their iced caffe caramel & hash browns this morning! So definitely came in & got an omelette as well. A lot of places don't have everything I want on an omelette so I had to make(build) my own. You can pick up to 3 items free of charge but after that it's like a $1 an item.   So I ordered an omelette with spinach, tomatoes, avocado, sausage, bacon, onions & cheddar chs. It comes with hash browns & toast (4 slices). Also I got a 20 oz iced caffe caramel.   So you basically order first & pay first at the register & tip first if you want. Then they give you a number and you get to sit where you want. The drinks are self serve if you pay. Also you pick your own utilities, condiments & etc., there's a little place in the middle to pick your stuff. Then you wait for your order to be brought to you. They brought my coffee first then my food.   The hash browns were a bit different but definitely good! So happy they weren't stingy with the portion either. The omelette was good too but there wasn't a lot of tomatoes in it(it looked like carrots), not sure if there was onions. But they definitely cut the veggies pretty tiny. That's good.   Also make sure to check in on yelp to receive a free coffee with your entree.   Also sign up for their loyalty program to start earning points.   There's also seating outside. They do have a tv inside too.",

My friend and I ordered avocado toast and bacon, which the toast is not on the menu, but we both have gotten it there in the past and it's been very good.  Today, at first, we got slices of toast on one plate and about a quarter of an avocado in slices on another because \"the way it was rung up at the register we didn't know how to do it.\" So she took it back to correct it and we got what you see in the photo minus the slices of avocado and bacon ... dry, dry toast with a teaspoon of smashed avocado. So.... we asked for more avocado and our bacon. Waitress leaves, comes back, with bacon and about the other quarter of avocado and...... another bill. \"We forgot to charge you for the bacon and we have to charge for extra avocado.\" (It wasn't extra it was enough). Ultimately, I paid $26.00 for two plates of what you see above. Disappointing.",

My main issue with this Scramble is how they ONLY have one point of sale system running on the weekends when I come. The line goes out the door and the queue wait time is just too long. You guys need to invest in another employee to man the other POS system and that place would be much more attractive. Think of it this way..... you guys know your quality.... the longer someone waits the better the food needs to be. By that logic just cut the wait time down and a review like mine would have been a 4 because of the quick service.  Just a though.",

I ordered a Phoenix omelette which was supposed to come with chorizo. There was a small amount of sausage mixed in, but no flavor at all. I'm not sure it was even chorizo at all. Worse, the eggs were so dry it tasted as if it had been microwaved from leftovers. Either that or terribly overlooked. I couldn't finish it.

He explained the menu and offered options for sides ( so this bouncer knew his info ) we worked our way through the line and everything was fabulous! Sat down and quickly received our food which was amazing ! Kids meals were a good size and I ordered the southwestern breakfast burrito  it was filled with , chorizo eggs and cream cheese topped that with a side of salsa ! My son ordered biscuits and gravy which I'm sure were made from scratch just like the other muffins that they had! Definitely a must go to spot ! We were checked on several times and the staff was phenomenal!",

The staff were so kind and helpful too.   We both ordered the Southwest breakfast burrito. It was okay. I was expecting this amazing, never before tasted burrito bug it was just meh. It had too much egg and not enough jalapeno cream cheese. My husband agreed. Although I will say their hash browns were tasty, fruit was fresh, and coffee was good.  Last but not least, we ordered a cinnamon roll, again it was just okay. The frosting is very sour creamy, and my hubs and I like the sweeter kind.   With all that being said, we WOULD go back to try other items on the menu the next time we are in AZ.",

The Santa Fe Eggs Benedict were great.  The spicy hollandaise went great with the corn bread cakes.  Highly recommended for those that like spicy and have not tried Eggs Benedict our do not like traditional hollandaise. It comes with rosemary potatoes which were okay but home fries would have been better.    The french toast was better than most.  Also recommended.   The star of breakfasthad to have been the sweet rolls.  The reviews are right on these.  Ours was moist all the way through.  The whole family raved about the sweet rolls.   We will be back for sure even though it is far from the house.",

Ask for the jalapeno cream cheese, that stuff is awesome.  Usually I overdue it and gorge on a breakfast burrito, but I didn't want to finish my meal both times I went.  Don't get me wrong, it's not bad, it's just not great.  The food was cooked well enough and tasted fresh, though the rosemary potatoes were cold and not very good both times I went.  Highly recommend the Cafe Caramel Coffee, incredible.    Short of that, everything else lacked the wow factor or really great overall flavor.  They seemed to play it safe across the menu.  Even the pancakes were a little bland.  On a side note, they make their waitresses wear wife beaters, which I thought was pretty original/cool.",

The first time it rolled to a recording and I chose not to leave a message but the second time, I listened to their message more closely. It clearly states to leave a message and they will call you back.  I left a cheerful request to have a reservation for 5 on Saturday morning but also said that if, by chance, they do not take reservations, please call me back.  On Saturday morning, two members of my group became unavailable so I called Scramble to let them know that I was changing the reservation from 5 to 3. \"We don't take reservations\". Ugh.  I politely let them know that I'd left a message saying that if they didn't take reservations, please call. \"We didn't get the message.\" Ugh  Once I did get there, the line moved swiftly and my order was delivered as anticipated. It's a bit difficult there to meet friends because if you are not there at the same time, then you either wait to get in line or receive your food at different times.   The food and the service were both good. Servers were friendly and helpful. I would go back but they need to fix their telephone communications in order to get a better rating from me.",

No doubt, this joint has a lot of great options for everyone, even if you feel like splurging.  Unfortunately, it was difficult finding a clean table to sit down at. It was just before noon on a Monday when we stopped in to eat, so I was a little surprised that it was already that messy. The floors definitely needed sweeping and the bathroom sink wasn't draining when I used it.   The customer service was a little odd. My boyfriend told me that the person who brought the food over to the table while I was in the restroom was condescending about the fact that we didn't get our own silverware. Honestly, we just had no idea we were supposed to pick up our own by the soda fountain. It was our first time eating here! On the contrary, the person working the register was very helpful and polite.   The food was alright. My boyfriend and I both ordered the Traditional Eggs Benedict, served with hash browns. The hollandaise sauce kind of reminded me of the packet version that you add butter and water to. I'm not saying that it didn't taste good, but almost seemed like something I could have made myself plus they used a little too much of it on the dish. The hash browns were served cold and under cooked so I barely touched them. Additionally, it took a while for the food to come out and there weren't too many customers at the time.",

I'm a huge fan of breakfast places and some places I usually go to are Matt's big breakfast, Perk Eatery, The Original breakfast house, 40th street cafe, and Oink, but wanted to venture out and give another place a shot.  I read the good reviews and decided to give this place a try.  Its a little different from breakfast spots, where you wait in line and order then sit down and they bring you the food.  Kind of like Jason's Deli.  We wanted in line for about 20 minutes and finally ordered.  We ordered strawberry French toast with a side of bacon, and biscuits and gravy.  We asked if the orange juice was fresh and they said it was...Clearly by tasting it, it clearly wasn't.  I should of been more specific, like was it freshly squeezed today?  Overall the food was ok, I thought the portions were a little small, but wasn't too bad.  I would come by this place again, but this place didn't stand out in my opinion.",

Visiting from Seattle area (in December when there's snow at home) so it was the perfect temperature for sitting outside under the umbrella with a coffee and pancakes.   Really love the apple cinnamon energy cakes. Great start to the day and a bigger portion that I expected which meant leftovers!  If you go on a weekend expect a line but it's quick enough and a pleasant environment to sit and wait for your food.",

In fact, I was pouring my coffee out of cup to get some fresh coffee and one of the service people saw me and asked if there was something wrong with the coffee. I told her that it wasn't very hot. She said she would bring a fresh pot out and give me a new cup with the hot coffee. Very observant worker! Was pleased with our experience and am glad we went back. Plan to be back to Scramble again. They are one of the few vegan friendly breakfast restaurants in the Valley. The tofu options are great! I had the Soyrizo burrito with sweet potato American fries. Yum!!!!",

The meals are very clean, healthy, and most of them seem to be gluten free.  I added salt and pepper to my \"Brizza\" and it was all it needed. Like my husband said \"I can actually taste the eggs and all the other ingredients\"!!!!! He had a Cuban Panini and soup, free coffee upon checking in with Yelp! He wasn't too happy with their coffee but he's picky. I had the \"Chicago Brizza\"... Which is like a pizza, with hash browns, sausage, eggs, monterey jack & cheddar as toppings! It was very very filling:) Also, I had an iced green tea. Which was flavored, no idea what flavor but I wasn't told it came that way... Not my favorite but I drank it:)   Anyways, will definately come back! They have a patio but it's facing 7th St so it's a bit noisy. Inside sitting is very comfy if you grab a booth!",

    "text": "Based on the Toluca Brizza (The chorizo with jalepeno cream cheese scrambled egg breakfast pizza), one can be sure I will be SCRAMBLING back to return for more! Corny pun intended, indeed! I ordered this round slice of scrumptiousness with a side of sweet potato hash and the Scramble Latte to wash it down and prevent me from a food coma, so I could have a productive day (...watching football).   At around 9am, a line already formed all the way outside the restaurant and a bit into one of the front parking spaces. We probably waited about more than 15 mins but less than 21 mins to get up to the order counter. We watched helplessly as we saw other groups of people find tables and save them before ordering against the restaurant's official courtesy sign on a pedestal that tells them not to. Fortunately, by the time we ordered, there were still tables available because people had left, and by 9:35, there was no more line. Funny thing is... right at 10am again, it gets crowded and there's a line. That's because people tell each other to meet at exact rounded times, 8am, 9am, 10am.... If you pick an odd time, it throws people off and it's less crowded.   Also, thanks to its great location, it's a hot spot for hikers to meet up after doing the trails nearby. There were tons of people after the Race for the Cure today here too. It's definitely a trendy place to be! But, it can be whatever it wants to be, because it is super good and fairly quick once you order!",

Both of us being vegan we ordered a vegan wrap and vegetable scramble. They asked if I wanted the sweet potatoes and I said yes. We paid and they gave us our number and we sat down.   About 10 minutes later a staff member came with a bag and said here is your Southwest Scramble to go. We said we had vegan food ordered and we were staying here. About 10 minutes later they came with our order. But, they did not have the sweet potatoes ready and I'd have to wait a few minutes.   The vegan veggie scramble was not vegan! Made with eggs! My wrap was totally bland. Only the salsa and hot sauce made it edible! Once I finished eating and we were about to leave they came with the sweet potatoes. I tasted them and they were not fully cooked and tasted terrible. I asked my wife to try them and she spit them out in her napkin.   When a staff member asked how everything tasted we told her the sweet potatoes were terrible. She said nothing and walked away.   There were other tables getting incorrect orders brought to their table as well. We saw at least 2 occasions.   Nit what we expect for a $30 breakfast from Scramble!!! We will not be back to this one and sad to say we should have spoke with the manager but, did not.   Gotta be better options!!!",

I always like their eggs benedict here and it was consistently good. They are also famous for breakfast pizza, they call it Brizza. Huge portion size, either share or bring big appetite.  Chairs they have here is not that comfortable unless you sit at the booth. Same as Scottsdale location. If you wear shorts, you will feel the cold and uncomfortable metal against your skin.

    "text": "I am soooooo sad I can't give them a 5. The first time we went was THE BEST breakfast I have ever had in my life. However the second time was alright, but you can tell when they are in their last hour or so from closing, they get sloppy.   The Space  I was in love with the building because although it isn't large, because of all the windows and bright colors, it feels so open. Of course it's a solid pro that there's also patio seating that allows dogs!  The Service You walk in the door and walk straight past the menus to a couple registers where they then give you a number and you wait at a table of your choice for them to bring your food. Simple enough!   The Food  I got the Vegan French Toast. Every other breakfast food to me was irrelevant after that. It is crisped to perfection, and they even give you little vegan butters to go with! I soaked every bit of it in their fantastic syrup. To go with the French toast, I also got their orange juice and a side of turkey sausage. The orange juice is a little tangy but still really sweet, and the turkey sausage was sooo spicy good. My boyfriend ordered the eggs Benedict and he was in love.  The Docked Star They were a soaring 5 star until the service took a little dip. We came back two days later because I was just hooked, I ordered the same thing and while the server was setting down my plate, he knocked over my orange juice. An accident of course, but given it had spilled all over my lap and the French toast, I expected more than just an OJ replacement. I wanted non orange juice French toast. I was surprised that he didn't even offer. This time my boyfriend ordered a sausage breakfast burrito, it was small and almost all eggs, so that was a letdown as well. If I was going just off of the second experience I would have given them a 3.  Overall I definitely recommend trying this place, I would just either order what we did the first round or order their highly rated dishes. But seriously, as long as there's no orange juice on it, that French toast is to die for.",

    "text": "Our breakfast was OK and there were plenty of options for the vegan in our party of three. But the inefficiencies of their system detracted from the otherwise tasty breakfast.  First the food. I ordered the Tex Mex eggs Benedict on a biscuit with pulled pork, avocado, pico-de-guillo and traditional Hollandaise sauce. I rather enjoyed the fusion of the traditional (poached eggs and Hollandaise) with the untraditional (spicy southwest/Mexican flavors and ingredients). It might not be eggs Benedict as originally created, but I'm all for expanding the concept and embracing local and regional flavors and ingredients. Two thumbs up for the concept! Execution however was average at best.   My son ordered the vegan burrito and it satisfied him in terms of flavor and substance. My wife ordered a breakfast pizza which she also enjoyed.   The thing that really bothered me was s-l-o-w process for placing your order. Though there were lots of open tables (at least half of the tables, maybe two thirds, were unoccupied), when we arrived the line stretched out the door. After 20-30 minutes you finally reach the counter, you place your order, get a placard with a number, grab a beverage, find a seat and wait until the food is delivered to your table (at least it was delivered promptly).   In theory this is not a bad system. One of the most popular semi-fast food places where I live uses a similar system. The difference is our local restaurant can handle six to eight customers at the order counter instead of just one at a time as at the Scramble we visited.  Call me old fashioned, but I'd rather come in, SIT down, place an order and sip my coffee while waiting at the table instead of STANDING in line for a half-hour. And the more I think about it, I'm not sure the food was actually worth the wait.",

    "text": "Ok since writing my original review we've been back several times and I love this place. The last few times we came in a weekend morning and it was busy but the line moved quickly.  I modified the veggie scramble with soy chorizo and avocado and omg it's SO GOOD. Also, there's so much food!! I would split it next time.   We also tried chocolate chip pancakes which are just the right level of fluffy and sweet. The blueberry French toast is also so good but good to split if you don't want a ton of sweet food.  The coffee always gives me life and the staff is seriously so nice and always helpful. It seems you can modify food very easily and they don't make you feel bad about it.  Any time friends are in town or we want to go out for breakfast we end up here.",

You walk up to the front, order, then sit down with a number and wait for your food to be delivered.   I went with the vegan veggie scramble and my friend just grabbed the Monterey scramble. My vegan scramble was pretty good, but a little lacking in flavor. I was able to spruce it up pretty well with some hot sauce/salt/pepper and it did end up tasting yummy. The vegan scramble comes with a sweet potato hash, but I dislike sweet potato and opted to switch that for the hashbrowns. It also came with a side of toast! Aka there was a ton of food and I ended up with leftover toast because I just could not finish the whole meal. My friend enjoyed her scramble and was left with toast at the end as well.   Overall, this is pretty good breakfast place with plenty of seating, good parking, and friendly service. Drop by if you are in the area and want yummy breakfast foods!",

    "text": "Scramble was a place that I decided to try spontaneously. I was looking for a decently rated breakfast place near where my parent live. All the reviews/photos that I saw looked great, so I decided to give this place a shot. I have to admit that I came here two days during a week that I was in the valley.  FOOD: The first time that I came here, I decided to try some traditional eggs benedict. That's become one of my favorite breakfast dishes lately that it easy to mess up if not prepared correctly. To my surprise, the food arrive at the table after only a short 10 minute wait. The presentation made the food look great, so I was eager to taste it. I will say that overall the food was great my first visit. The sauce and eggs tasted great. The portion was a great size, and I was impressed. During my second visit, the food suddenly took a turn downhill. I ordered a basic breakfast burrito. The food came out at around the same time, but honestly was sad. The breakfast burrito was much more or an egg burrito. There was hardly any flavor at all, and the meat inside was bare to minimal. Maybe I just got lucky with the meal on my first visit, but the second go around made me much less willing to return.   SERVICE: Mind you that this is a pay at the counter, take a number, and sit at a table while you wait for your food to be bought to you. The first visit that I had was pleasant service. The second visit accounts for a majority of my less than great rating. When our food was brought out to us, the runner set my plate down at an angle and spilled an entire cup of orange juice that we bought alllllll over our table, shirts, and shoes. Now let me say that I understand accidents happen. But we were soaked in this sticky juice. The kid just said \"i'll clean that up and get you another cup\". In the meantime, we were left to clean up our clothes and shoes in the bathrooms. I guess i'm just disappointed in the service because no manager was notified to come and apologize, or even ask to see if we needed anything else. The runner came back and wiped up the ground and never said another word. A bad representation of service if you ask me. That alone makes me also not want to return as a customer.   OVERALL: Scramble seems to be a hit or miss type of business. Between two separate visits, I encountered great quality, and the other was the complete opposite. I'm not sure if I will honestly come back after the last little disappointment in food and service.",

All I'm going to say , is that the food was not good. It was dry and bland. Definitely not worth 20 dollars. Unfortunately it's not just this location. I've been to two different scrambles in the valley and they were both terrible. I tried , but I will not be re visiting any scramble locations again. They may want to adjust their pricing as wells. You can't charge high end prices for McDonald's level quality food.",

You stand in line to place your order at the counter, pay, get your own drink, utensils and condiments. Then choose your own table. A waiter than will bring out your food.   Wife ordered chocolate chip pancakes. I had a few bites and they were truly delicious. Melt in your mouth. I had the steak and eggs with wheat toast and has browns. All tasted great and fresh. Steak and hash browns were well done and eggs over easy were done just right. Steak was tender and seasoned well.   Customer service was great, our order came out exactly correctly and ambience was great. For those who have to wait for a table, they have complimentary iced tea and water outside and plenty of seating outside. Outside seating is pet friendly.",

I ordered biscuits and gravy,  came on small plate & while not terrible there was very little gravy. Had hot tea which was very good as it brews in container in cup. My over all view was a little expensive for the food delivered. Sorry to say but won't be back. I thought would be better as had good reviews. Must have different views of what's good than me",

Overall the food was average to us and most disappointingly the coffee was not fresh and we got the bottom of the barrel. My son ordered the Chicago style pizza which was very bland which was the same complaint my daughter had about her breakfast pizza. The two little kids did enjoy their pancakes with French berries and a cinnamon roll. My wife had a mushroom skillet and toast which she said was fairly average. I had French toast which I thought was very good and it was a thicker sourdough bread which I enjoyed. Overall a mixed experience for us.",

Occasionally, the music is so loud that we cannot hear each other even when we are sitting next to the other person. We usually ask if they can turn the music down, with a smile, they agree and in no time the music is at a decent level and we are able to continue our meeting in a great environment. Today we were meeting at Scramble and the music was unusually loud and there were only about 3 tables that were full. I asked if they could lower the level of the music and again with a smile the staff agreed. Shortly after I returned to my table she came to inform us that her manager said she could not lower the volume on the request of the owner. We asked to speak to the manager and when she came over she again told us that the owners of the establishment has instructed her to keep the music at this particular volume during business hours. We told her that we are frequent customers who are meeting on business and it is difficult to hear one another. She again told us that the owner has requested that she leave the volume as is, they would like to create a certain vibe for their restaurant and she is unable to do anything for us. About an hour and a half into our meeting we noticed the level of noise dramatically increase due to the amount of people in the building trying to talk over not only each other but the loud music. I personally find it very hard to believe that an owner would rather lose customers than to lower the volume of the music. Every time we are at this establishment we notice that there are several tables of meetings taking place not just social eating. There will be a lot of business walking out their door if the owners truly stick with this new \"vibe.\"",

The Gouda brizza is made with smoked gouda and apple smoked bacon. What can be wrong with that combo? Absolutely nothing! I have also had The Toluca. It has chorizo, peppers, cheese, and jalapeno cream cheese. This brizza is so good, but very rich.   I have also had the three cheese omelet. The first time I had it the omelet, it was brown, dry, and inedible. I sent it back and the replacement was excellent. The truth is the rosemary potatoes were the best thing about the meal.   This morning I work up with a craving for pancakes. So, I ordered the multigrain pancakes. When they arrived they looked great. However, when I took my first bite I was so disappointed. I went back and looked at the menu, and there was no mention that these were cinnamon pancakes. There was so much cinnamon in these pancakes that they were nearly inedible. Imagine chewing 2 sticks of Big Red chewning gum and taking a bite of pancake. That is what it tasted like. The cinnamon taste actually took my breath away. I couldn't finish them. They left a horrible after taste in my mouth. I love cinnamon, but just not in my pancakes. If I had known that these were cinnamon pancakes, I wouldn't have ordered them.   I am sure that I will go back to Scramble, but I am pretty sure I will not order the pancakes again. They should really revise the menu to mention that these are cinnamon pancakes.",

    "text": "A few weeks ago, I probably would have hooked Scramble up with a 5-star update, but they did something to piss me off and the service has been a bit sour lately.  I really love and appreciate how accommodating for vegans they are. I love the soyrizo scramble with nutritional yeast and the garlic chili chaluhla sauce. I smother it and it tastes sooooo good that I crave it all week long. I know others enjoy the sauce too because the bottles are always being used, but for some ungodly known reason Scramble decided to stop providing the sauce. WTF man???   The cashiers don't seem to be especially knowledgeable about the products and it generally takes 2x as long to order a vegan meal than it does a normal meal.  They also recently started putting in bigger chunks of green bell pepper which I think really detracts from the taste. I have also been jipped on my avocado twice now, and my English Muffin barely toasted.   I have to admit, the french toast and the English Muffin (when cooked right) have a special place in my soul! And there is nothing better that vegan butter  being readily available.  More knowledgeable cashiers, quicker bus service on a busy day, and a re-introduction of the chili garlic sauce and you will have me back. As for now, I'm so mad about the discontinuation that I cannot even look at you!",

Noise level on the higher side but tolerable. I ordered the veggie breakfast scramble with sweet potato hash browns. And hubby ordered the veggie scramble burrito. The food came out on large square plates and I was expecting a slightly larger amount of food. There was a small helping of sweet potato hash and a small amount of scramble and two slices of toast and a slice of orange.  The scramble tried to be flavorful and had a nice mix of veggies but fell below expectations. Hubby's veggie burrito on the other hand was delicious and flavor-able.  Neither one of us was too impressed with the sweet potato hash browns.  It was the first time either of us had them. I love sweet potato fries so maybe I was making a flavor connection that just isn't there. Maybe the way they tasted is the way they are supposed to taste. Looking around the room it looked like everyone was enjoying their food. Must admit the vegan French toast someone else was having looked simply amazing.  I would definitely give the place another try and choose a different dish and see how that review would compare to this one.  I am just thankful there are vegan options in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Scramble is a great breakfast and brunch joint, and I'm glad to see that it's doing well. I give it a 4.5 out of 5.  I've only tried a handful of dishes from this place but they've always been quite good. The star of the show, in my opinion, is the brizza - a biscuit-dough breakfast pizza that I've been in love with since my first visit.  My first dining experience I ordered the Toluca brizza and it was incredibly good, although I will warn that the jalapeno cream cheese and the chorizo have a definite bite to them, so gringos beware! I've also had the Gouda brizza, and it was smoky and yummy, but I much prefer the Chicago, with a side of their awesome, stick-to-your-ribs sausage gravy as a dipping side.  Buttermilk biscuits and gravy are a meal unto themselves. The mushroom and bacon omelette is just dead-on, with garlic-sauteed mushrooms and chunks of thick-cut bacon.  I'll admit that I haven't tried their lunch menu, but if that quality is as high as   I had been here once before, when the location was still a Le Pepe, and was surprised by the change in decor: It's very modern and trendy. If you've ever watched Restaurant: Impossible on Food Network, it's got a very up-to-date vibe like a lot of their remodels do. Seating is comfortable but I will admit that the steel-tube chairs can pinch a bit, and that's probably the only reason I don't mark this as a 5 because breakfast\\lunch places are the kinds of place where you stuff yourself and then linger for 20 minutes afterward, drinking soda or coffee and chatting.  I hope Scramble keeps doing well, because they deserve it. It's an excellent breakfast\\brunch joint, and we need more of it!",

My husband and I had brunch here on a Monday am, so it was quiet and comfortable. It's a Chipotle or Paradise style place, where you line up, order, and then take your seat while food is brought out to you. The middle ground between fast food and restaurant.  I remember the food being good, but not outstanding. His was better than mine, but I think part of the reason that was so was because he had a really rich chipotle sauce on his. I hadn't been up to something that rich that morning. And while they do have a full compliment of traditional breakfast drinks, I was extremely disappointed that they didn't have mimosas or bloody mary's. I think if they did it would've kicked this review up from 3.5 to 4 stars.   An enjoyable experience, but not something I'd drive from halfway across town for.",

Me:  \"whichever one is vegan is fine.\" Cashier:  \"I'll have to check\"...comes back in a minute.... \"none of them are vegan, but you can substitute fruit as a side if you'd like\"   Not wanting to take up any more time at the register as there is a long line behind me, I said that fruit was fine.   When a server brought my food I asked him if it is in fact True that none of the bread or toast is vegan and he agreed that even the toast that is listed as a side on the vegan menu is not vegan.  I should have asked how they could serve \"vegan\" french toast if none of their bread products are vegan.   So either there is a lot of confusion among the staff about their food/menu or they are serving non-vegan food as vegan.",

At Disney, everyone gets to the front of the line...and to their share of the breakfast magic...sooner or later.  The food? Utterly soulless, just like the robot-babes.  Rosemary potatoes? Yup. There's potato. There's rosemary. Can't argue with that.   Scramble browns? Perfectly formed circle. Browned dark on one side; light on the other. Don't like it too dark? Turn it over!  Multigrain pancakes? Multigrained? Yup. Pancake? Yup. Perfectly round? Yup. Consistently sized? Yup. Too much cinnamon to cover the bland basic mix? Yup. Lots of syrup? Yup!!! Robot-babe, bring more syrup! I say these pancakes are just as good as any frozen Eggo product you're going to find!  Poached egg? It was poached. Nice yellow yolk, just like the safe eggs from Safeway. Served in a nice little cup to keep them from running all over your plate.  Scramble Latte? Super sugary!  Coffee? Yes. Bold option? Bold! Regular option? Regular!  ALERT! ALERT! ALERT! Someone call Hyatt Place. The orange robot-babes have stolen all their square white plates. They are the perfect dishes for the automated restaurant of the future: unbreakable, stackable, space-saving, and easy to load and remove from an automated dish washing system!  Got a group? No problem! All the tables are sized for two and are portable so they can be moved all around the restaurant to provide seating for a couple, a family or even a whole book club! Be careful though. I would advise against creating any unique arrangements, say such as lining up tables on a 45-degree angle. I suspect the robot-babes could not compute. The entire restaurant could spin out of control and crash. Experiment with caution.  Folks, this food is every bit as good as the \"free breakfast\" you can get at La Quinta, Holiday Inn Express and Hyatt Place and better automated. Plus you get orange robot-babes! If you like your hotel breakfast, you're gonna LOVE this place.",

Found a table outside since the music and kitchen noise was a bit high inside.  Had to fix the outside table to keep it from wobbling. After a few minutes the traffic noise was too loud to carry on our meeting so we moved inside.    Food came in about 10 minutes. Quality was fine however my guest said pancakes were a bit tough.  Likely over cooked.    Meat lovers scramble was good with crisp hash browns.    Service was fine and appropriately attentive.",

    "text": "I have visited Scramble many times since they introduced the vegan menu items, which is why I was surprised I had not reviewed them. Scramble is getting 4 stars instead of 3 because I truly appreciate the effort to offer vegan items and how they responded to vegan inquiries. Having said that, a few minor things continue to bother me:  1. I feel like the tofu in the vegan burrito isn't really seasoned anymore. It was never heavily seasoned but I feel like it's gotten a bit more bland and sometimes appears like its just plain tofu heated up.   2. I feel like the tortilla would be better if it was grilled a bit. It seems kind of chalky and cold when I am wanting it to be browned and slightly warm.  3. The soy chorizo is a nice addition but it's kind of close in texture and consistency to the tofu so it all just blends together. Something like some veggie sausage or tempeh bacon in with the tofu or as an option would be a great.   It might seem like I am complaining but lets face it, you don't have many vegan options in Phoenix for breakfast. Ironically that might be why I am not impressed as much now as was forced to figure out how to make a mean vegan scramble and vegan breakfast sandwich at home for all these years, so maybe I have just had more practice and now I know what works and what doesn't.  The sweet potato hash is still fantastic and was a knock out addition to the menu (for vegans and omnis!)  I still dig the decor, it's always clean, the service is good, the bathrooms are nice and the consistency issues seems to have gotten much better. Scramble would really be an easy 5 stars in my book with some more attention to improving the vegan selections. Maybe I am asking for too much but I am a vegan and we like to whine and complain a lot so there!",

Overall the place was clean but it seemed as if they were not ready to be open this morning.  Another thing to note that is not very clear is that it is a walk up service restaurant.   You order, then find a table and then they bring out your cold food.",

The counter service is pretty fast but the portions are small so order more than you think you need. We wanted to add a side of hash browns and a side of sausage after we saw the small portions but the line was out the door so that wasn't possible. They should add an iPad terminal for add on orders. The furnishings are clean and modern looking it reminds me of a cafe in Switzerland I visited once. The coffee is good and the little coffee bar is neat but you end up making multiple trips to grab all you need to eat a meal. The silverware should be in roll ups so you get everything with a napkin in one grab. Food was ok. I got the French French toast but the custard was barely there and not soaked I to the bread at all so it was like eating bread with syrup. Husband got the brizza. He liked it and thought it was tasty. The hash browns and bacon were excellent. Nice view out the window too.",

I found it to be quite bland - the dough isn't that great and the scrambled eggs on it taste like the egg mix served up in cafeterias.  The standard breakfast fare was good though, so I'd recommend sticking to the basics and get an omelette or something like that...",

We tried the brizza (breafast pizza) with bacon and gouda, the gringo burrito, a cinnamon roll and coffee.    The portions are generous - not usually a selling point for me, but it more than justifies the price, which for the burrito is about double the price at a 'berto's (pick a 'berto, any 'berto).  The brizza was excellent.  I'm looking forward to the leftover half for lunch.  The gringo burrito was indeed gringo-y as advertised; fresh eggs, cripy bacon, lots of melted cheese.  Red salsa on the side (I wonder if they have green?) Not being a  melted cheddar fan, I'll have to ask them to hold that next time.  Cinnamon role was servicable - not crazy carbs-be-damned  good, but tasty.  I look forward to making use of the expanded patio.  Ergonomics report:  The benches are confortable!  How often does THAT happen??  Just the right height and depth to provide comfortable back support within reach of the table.  And the staff happily changed the TV channel from cartoons to CNN at our request.",

Room For Improvement: I've only been here once, so I can't think of anything now....  Overall: I'm a fan. I wish they had a location in the East Valley; I think I'd be a regular.",

You order at the counter but the staff does deliver to the table and cleans up the dishes for you?  Our group kept changing orders and asking for menu alternatives - the epitome of the difficult customers - and yet our cashier was patient and accommodating.  I had the Vegan Mushroom Scramble with sweet potato hash and a side of fruit in lieu of the bread (no additional charge). My brother got a bacon and cheese omelet with jalapeno cornbread. They also offer sides of pancakes instead of toast, if you like. The meal was delicious with plenty of options for everyone in the group to be happy.  I like that there are several vegan options on the menu. We just made closing and were the last customers to leave but we're not made to feel rushed at all. I will definitely make it back here whenever I'm in Phoenix.",

It's a self-service place - you wait in line to put in your order, find a table, bring the number to your table and someone brings out your food to your table.  I had the vegan scramble with the sweet potato hash.  The vegan scramble was scrambled tofu with tumeric - it was DELICIOUS.  The sweet potato hash was a bit strange at first but very tasty.  Rosemary potatoes were also delicious.  And the whole wheat toast is great - not the generic supermarket quality but a good hearty bread.  The capuchino that I got for free for checking in on Foursquare was delicious (very strong). However, the one negative on this place is that their drip coffee is atrocious - I mean, it tasted like water.  Literally. I tried the Italian and the decaf and both were watery - no taste at all.  I hope that today it was just an off day, because given how tasty everything else is and the fact that they are a brunch place that coffee quality would be so poor.",

I always get the eggs Benedict or breakfast burrito!  Only slight negative is I never know what to tip cause they do clean up after us, bring us our food and check on us. but we order in line, get own drinks, napkins, jelly, etc.  Dont know if the 20 percent gratuity still applies or if if you should tip less since they do less work.

Lots of open space, plenty of tables, TVs, seems really modern for a breakfast joint.  I ordered the breakfast burrito which was excellent.  Very unique and didn't depend on a lot of grease for flavor.  My sister got the Eggs Benedict which she also enjoyed.  Had this been a lunch place I would have given it 4 stars, but it just stood out as a unique place to me for breakfast.  Very good menu choices, friendly staff, easy parking, reasonably priced.

I said, \"they always make the eggs hard\" Eggs Benedict are supposed to be runny. My muffin was bareky toasted, I cut into the first egg, it was okay, not great. I cut into the second egg, not a runny yolk in sight. I took it back, personally, with a piece of bacon and crispy hash browns on my plate. 10 minutes later I got an uncooked English muffin after asking for a crispy muffin again, with a perfect Eggs Benedict. My hash browns disappeared off the plate they were missing. I hardly ever take myself out to breakfast but Eggs Benedict are my favorite and National Eggs Benedict day is something I do not intend to miss. But next time I'll be going elsewhere",

Arrived about 10 minutes prior to closing at 2 p.m. the counter front register girl tried to sway me into getting a burrito when I asked for a chorizo plate. Paige another employee was excellent.  She was bright, professional and helpful. The food was presented nicely but the hash browns were slightly undercooked. If it wasn't for the cash register girl and hash browns I would have given it a four star rating.",

Also given free cups for water which you can add lemon. Only reason not a five star because had to wait online to order but not a deterrent to come.",

I would happily pay $1 more (because let's face it organic tofu isn't much) for organic and peace of mind. The hash browns are yummy. The prices are very reasonable. Truly enjoy the fresh OJ. The coffee is good and I really enjoy the coffee station with all of the accessories. The wikki sticks for the kids are really fun and great for keeping those little hands occupied while waiting for the food to come. But I will not/cannot return until the tofu is organic.",

It's  modern and sleek look made a nice atmosphere for our late Sunday brunch. It wasn't loud or chaotic, an enjoyable experience.   I got the French French toast which was delicious but the shining star on the plate was the scrambled browns my husband got.

They even have a lunch menu for those who aren't a big fan of breakfast like paninis, salads, wraps and soup.  I ALWAYS get an orange juice because it's fresh squeezed!

They suggested that we go to Black Bear Diner, but they were closed. So I went on Yelp and suggested Scramble. I'm glad I did.  I tried the French Toast(delicious!) and sampled some of the other fare off of peoples plates. The pancakes were a bit rubbery, but the service, ambiance and other good food made up for the shortcoming.  I definitely recommend it.  Everyone else in our 10+ party enjoyed their food and said they'd probably come back.  It's in a kinda weird area for me, since growing up here that particular area was referred to as the \"ghetto\". But it seems to have changed in the 10+ years I've been gone. The decor is Ikea-like, but comfortable. They have seating inside and out (if you can stand the heat!). They also have 'misters' outside.",

Perhaps all of the above make me a fan of this joint!   I so love Scramble ( Did I say that already?). On my first visit, I was with Mr. Hottie and we were Harley geared out . The staff didn't bat an eyelash at our rough appearances. They were warm and welcoming. I had the traditional eggs Benedict. I thought it was very good! I washed it down with a cup of coffee and was ready to tackle the rest of my day!   On my second visit I had the biscuits and gravy. WHAT a huge portion! I wasn't terribly impressed by the dish, however. I guess I expected a little more flavoring in the gravy, but overall, the dish was satisfying.   My third visit had me munching on the spicy and tasty chorizo and egg burro with extra avocado. Mmm... I couldn't eat the whole burro. I ate almost half of it and took the rest home.   Each time I visit Scramble I am impressed by the staff. There is a person on the floor at all times checking on people and making sure their food is ok. Considering this is a walk up and order type of place, it's a nice change to not be forgotten after you receive your food.   I know that Scramble will be a regular breakfast stop for me. It's nice to see such a great place take a chance on Sunnyslope. I think they'll come out winners!",

After the recent UYE here for Foster Kids ( A group I hold especially dear)  I really can't wait to take others here..  Scramble could be  a great place in my list of restaurants because of a few reasons ..  1. Located on 7th street  near many of my friends  who live in Central Phoenix or Moon Valley  -great for the girls to eat before going on a day outing   2.Food is served with a walk up line and  served fast ..that means not fussing with waiter, or  waiting for service and you eat good but quick  3. The food is tasty  , while maybe not rich  or decadent or over the top the food is great tasting  but without leaving you feeling like you need a nap. Food quality is good , it taste like they just made it in Grandmas kitchen without adding a lot of grease.   4. It's got that modern coolness thing  going on ...Atmosphere does say something specially when you are meeting friends...   Thanks Scramble for your unique niche in my mental list of places to eat breakfast....  now if you only served Brinner every night!",

Scramble is one of those places that could probably be my go-to spot if they just had one menu item (preferrably a side) that stood out and that you couldn't get anywhere else. If this item exists and I missed it please someone fill me in...  You order at the front counter and pay then they bring it out to you. This is kindof a saving grace if you are in a hurry. For instance if you were out too late bowling and drinking and crashed on Amber W's couch and probably should be at work already but there is no way you are going without breakfast and since you managed to leave your debit card at the bowling alley Amber W offers to buy you breakfast....because this happens sometimes.",

    "text": "Usually when the cashier informs you the menu is out of date it means what you wanted to order is no longer available or the price went up.  Not so this time, they are still in the mode of adjusting to initial customer comments and the $9 omelet now includes one side AND a bread.  That brings the price point in line with what I consider a regular breakfast choice instead of a special occasion breakfast.  None of that would matter if the food wasn't good.  I had the western omelet with english muffin and bacon.  The bacon is cherry wood smoked and a perfect firm but not crispy.  The omelet had ham, peppers and grilled onions.  And the muffin came with real butter.  I almost forgot to take a picture before I dug in.  All of the food and coffee was good.  I got there at 6:01 and was greeted with a smile.  She did admit she has to work at being a morning person.  I had the entire place to myself until just before I left.  My food was out very quickly.  Thanks to Donny T's review I remembered to grab my table service before the food arrived.  I even found the place headed south without becoming a traffic hazard.  Scramble shares the building with Il Posto.  At the time of the morning I am about it isn't hard to get there and get to work.  Even though it is a ways away I am sure I will find my way back again.",

They had a fresh one out to me a short while later and it was excellent. The Costa burrito was a bit on the greasy side, but such is the nature of chorizo. The flavor was great and the potatoes it was served with were also decent. I would highly recommend also getting a side of the scramble browns. You won't be disappointed.   The patio has an excellent view of the mountains, so if you're ever in the Sunnyslope area and are in need of breakfast/brunch, Scramble is worth checking out.",

    "text": "Found this place today thanks to Yelp. We were looking for a good breakfast place with variety and quality. This is the place! Large menu with all sorts of items from breakfast burritos to eggs benedict, to pancakes and French toast.  Their food is high-quality and they source their breads, vegetables and meats locally.  The only disappointment was the biscuits and gravy and cinnamon roll. Both were dry and cold. The cinnamon roll had frosting on top but it did not even melt as there was no heat from the roll to melt it. And the biscuits and gravy was dense, cold, and not as flavorful as I had hoped. . Definitely looking forward to coming back again though!  UPDATE: Gave this place another chance today. The cinnamon roll that I had today was perfect! Lots of flavor and nice and warm. However, I am still not a big fan of the biscuits and gravy. There is nothing wrong with them. It is just my personal taste. The gravy is quite thick and he biscuit is dense. Again, just a personal opinion. I did try the flatbread breakfast pizza today though. That was fantastic! A new breakfast favorite!",

And the Costa breakfast burrito which came with potatoes The burrito itself was really good and flavorful I didn't like the potatoes, so I just let them sit there  The service was a little slow but not a big deal at all, I'm very patient and I saw how busy it was All of the girls working were very friendly and cute It was a good first experience and maybe next time I will try the breakfast pizza",

The line was out the door but the cafe relatively empty as you order then sit down. very nice fellow outside offering cups of oj and coffee.  The staff was uber friendly but points docked for atmosphere.  Super industrial cafeteria style. Ordered a cappuccino and they only come in 16 ounce cups? They don't have any other size or anything but disposable cups.. Bit wasteful. Eggs Benedict came with  under cooked cooked sad hash browns and pancakes ok.. Syrup not the real maple deal which seems weird for a place claiming to be local and farm fresh. I see that claim so often these days and not sure everyone is sincere about that.  We like to seek out restaurants serving local ingredients and There was nothing really convincing us they were doing so despite the claims on the menu.  Folks who worked there though were really great though and prices really reasonable.",

    "text": "I ate at Scramble last Friday and I have to say that it was a horrible experience.  What attracted me to this place was the separate vegan menu in addition to their regular menu - this makes things easier when dining with vegan and non-vegan friends.  So I happily ordered a tofu wrap and added fried potatoes as a side and awaited my food.  We started eating and my friend found a hair in his food...not good!  He threw it on the floor and tried to drop it.  Well moments later I found a hair in my food...  I couldn't believe there was hair on both of our plates!  I was so disgusted I could no longer eat my food (and I was ravenous).  I told the girl working the register about the whole ordeal, she walked back to the kitchen then back to the register and completely ignored me (she said she'd come back to my table).  Before we left I spoke with someone else and showed them the hair, clearly not one of mine.  All I got was \"Oh, I'll check the guys in the back.\"  Check the guys in the back???  What?  How about, sorry may I refund you your money?  Additionally, the few bites I had of my burrito were pretty bland, it needed seasoning or hot sauce.  Overall, I wouldn't go back...unless I somehow develop a taste for hair, although I'm sure that won't happen.  I did take a picture of my food before I attempted eating it and if you zoom in enough you can see part of the hair sticking out of my food - I'll be posting them.",

We had the french toast, roasted potatoes, and the sausage and gravy  with biscuits..all was tasty.  Sweet vanilla dipped french toast..I gobbled it up and could have had another plate.  The gravy was very thick and full of sausage..and kind of spicy.  The biscuits didn't really look like biscuits more like rolls.  Scramble seems to get really busy on the weekends!  Long lines to wait to order and then you have to find a place to eat. We would've sat outside however, the tables were wet.   The staff was really friendly and definitely were helpful in clearing tables to get the next group seated.  However, we had a family who just kept coming and asking us to move over, very annoying.  One of the daughters almost sat on my friend's purse and was not even apologetic for doing so, and then another person came and asked us to move again.  We just ended up leaving because they were annoying for sure and I was just thinking they would have another 3 family members wanting to sit next to them and it doesnt make the best experience for other guests.  So I think somehow, Scramble needs to figure out how to manage large groups, because it was very annoying.  We would've left a tip for the girls but was just annoyed that we left since it felt like we were getting kicked out.  So , go over the week, to avoid these family groups.     Scramble , I will be back but just not the weekends, I don't want to keep moving around while I'm trying to enjoy your  tasty french toast!",

My over medium eggs were really over easy (don't like runny egg whites). I asked for fruit instead of toast and got a fruit cup of cantaloupe and two grapes. Eh. They do have good vegan selections, so next time we have vegan guests I may give them another shot...but not too soon.",

I'm looking forward to sitting down, being greeted by fresh-faced wait-staff, and given a chance to peruse the breakfast offering while sipping my piping hot cup of joe.  Smell the joe...deep breaths...choices...ah...I love the smell of choices in the morning.  Dreams...dashed...  I walk in and suddenly there's a line, nay, a chute, toward a counter.  Where is the menu?  Oh, it's on the wall.  Are we at Pei Wei?  At least I already know what I want when I'm at Pei Wei.  This Scramble is new and it's breakfast!  I have to slowly consider how each offering might be experienced across my palate.  But there's no time--no time!  The line is getting shorter!  Closer to the counter!  Aah!  Um, okay...I'll go with the...uh, oh God, what if I make the wrong decision?  Aah!  It doesn't matter.  More hungry patrons breathe down my neck as the end of the line looms closer.  Breakfast Sandwich!  Or sammy, or something like that.  Juice?  Yes, sure (there's so much pressure!) Coffee?  No.  Wait, what?  Did I just say no to coffee?  Aah!  She's giving me a number--what's this for?  No time!  Keep moving!  Go sit down!  What's that over there?  Where is the silverware?  So much stress!  And now I have no coffee.  Should I go re-enter the chute to ask for coffee?  No, I can't put myself through that again.  God, I wish I had coffee.  This is taking a while.  Oh, look, they've brought our food.  Potatoes!  Wait...these are...wet?  I thought it said something about rosemary?  Haven't these people ever eaten at Matt's?  Now that's a good rosemary country potato.    I wish we had gone to Matt's.  Wait...didn't this used to be Le Peep?",

    "text": "Scramble = awesome in my book. Met a friend for brunch one day and ordered the Santa Fe Eggs Benedict. I am a huge Benedict fan and am always in search of the newest most original best eggs Benedict and for right now, Scramble serves it. The Santa Fe eggs Benedict features jalapeno cornbread, ham, poached eggs and chipotle hollendaise. Whoever thought to use jalapeno cornbread (they are more like sweet corn cakes) is a fricken genius! The sweetness of the cornbread/ cake cuts through the saltiness of the ham and then there is a slight spiciness from the hollendaise. So many flavors going around in your mouth!!! Absolutely spectacular. It came with country potatoes which were decent but I liked eating them with the Benedict, together, as one   :)    Scramble is now one of my breakfast spots due to this one eggs Benedict which is the only thing I have tried there. I like the walk up order concept and the modern simple atmosphere works perfectly fine for me. They also allow dogs on the patio which gets me kinda excited to bring one of my little ones (dogs) here! The one bummer is that it is pretty far away from me. The drive from Maricopa out to Squaw Peak which is kinda the general area is about an hour. However, that wont stop me from coming back!",

    "text": "I decided to go out on a limb and give scramble another chance. after my bland experience with them the first time, but my akin likeness for modernized breakfast joints drew me back.   I brought a book and some paper to read and take notes for homework and arrived backpack in hand, and hungry for a hearty breakfast. southwestern breakfast burrito sounds delicious, chorizo, eggs, and jalepeno cream cheese?! I'll take it.  disappointed with the meaty-cheesy hashbrowns from last time, I went with the rosemary potatoes as suggested to me by the owner regarding my last yelp review. counter girl informs me sorry, we're out of rosemary potatoes. shock, gasp, awe. went for their signature hashbrowns again, reluctantly. regular coffee. $14.50. my jaw nearly hit the floor. scramble could stand to reduce their prices a little.   my order arrived about ten minutes later, almost too hot to dig in at first. i sat at the window on a stool, which was quite comfortable, and enjoyed the rainy morning. dug into the hashbrowns first, drizzled with some cholula. they were a lot better than last time, and i enjoyed every last bite of them. as for the burrito, i tried it at first without the jalepeno cream cheese, salsa, or sour cream, because they all came on the side. what was, for one bite, a seemingly bland breakfast burrito, became a spicy breakfast sensation with all of the aforementioned sides spread across it.   it began to get loud in there, and people everywhere i go seem to have this habit of sitting next to me with their talkative and annoying children when they can see I'm clearly engaged in an intellectually stimulating activity that stands to be disrupted abruptly by your obnoxious toddler. the place is huge, and there are plenty of open seats and cartoons tuned on their abundant flat screen tvs. i left after about 10 minutes of attempting to tolerate messy loud children, and enjoyed a smoke out on their large patio.  overall, a better dining experience, but a little expensive for my college student budget. the wait staff was friendly, and the place is filled with cute girls to make you blush. i would love to see more combination plates, like how with the omelette comes with a choice of two sides. it would be awesome to get pancakes, bacon, and eggs altogether for a set [lower] price than ordering everything a-la-carte. at least, that's how I prefer my breakfast: hearty.",

The price was very reasonable and the service was fantastic! All of the servers did an excellent job making sure that I had everything I needed.  I ordered the southwest breakfast burrito (I think that was the name) and I substituted the chorizo with bacon, and had them add mushrooms instead of the jalepeno cream cheese.  It was excellent and more than enough food.  I took home half of it in a to-go box.  I would recommend to anyone who wants a good breakfast menu with very tasty healthy items.

    "text": "First time here - and let me tell you, a whole debacle started over just that.   Upon walk-up, there was a greeter at the door who, as we reached for the door handle and pulled it ajar, asked us if we were \"new here\" in which we told her we were. Then she proceeded into a lengthy, very rehearsed explanation at how the inside set up was going to work, all the while other guests were approaching the entrance too - including one a-hole who just squeezed in passed us as if I was holding the door open for him and after I called him out he said \"Well?! Im not new here!\". I barely could pay attention to her monologue while all of these other people passed us at the door, and finally we just thanked her barely comprehending what she had just said and went in to line up. This whole set up already gave us anxiety.   Now we get to the cramped line at the door where you look at menu panels as you walk further in. To me, this isn't exactly the ideal set up as one can't see the entire menu to decide, you have to read them as you walk further in and people move out of your way. So far I am not getting the concept here. Like, I do get it, but I don't get it. It's a breakfast house, not a factory line. I don't like feeling I am being processed through a system when I go to eat.   We ordered the Meat Lovers Scramble and the gringo Burrito. We thought the prices seemed a little much for it being a quick-order-and-eat breakfast place, but it has great reviews, so...  Yeah, the Meat Lovers, not so meaty. It was scrambled eggs and bacon and ham. Now that I look back at the menu, I realize it says here sausage too, ours had no sausage. It wasn't a very large portion, and having some limp, soggy hash browns aside and then wheat toast - we were recounting trips to IHOP being more satisfied with a similar order. And for $8.29? It's not to be mean, it's just True. My boyfriend was still hungry after this so I shared some of mine.   The Gringo Burrito was really good. I would eat that again. I didn't expect much from scrambled eggs and bacon in a tortilla, but it was tasty. I feel like it needed the salsa and sour cream it came with sides of, but it was good. Realistically though, I could just make it at home. Hash browns, again, I've had a lot better (even at Denny's). That's a shame because good hash browns can save a boring breakfast dish.   We saw someone going around and asking the tables how they were doing and if and what they liked, but no one came to our table or we would have shared. Oh well, looks like a lot of people love it here so to each their own, eh?!",

It's a unique concept, that actually makes your breakfast experience quick if you want it to be...or you relax and enjoy the free wifi. You enter to the order counter, then are waited on by the staff. Sometimes I hate HATE this method, but they have actually made it work really well - a big part of that is the sharp staff.  I ordered the berry pancakes, and turkey sausage...must say excellent food, and excellent turkey sausage patties. I might recommend syrup/jelly caddies on the tables, I'm just not a huge fan of predetermined portion cups as I'm definitely more liberal with my syrup.  Overall, great place. Very solid menu, with great food quality - and \"ready to serve\" staff.  Thank You!",

For the last three years I have been eating a bit more healthy so I usually get an omelette with some cottage cheese. The price is a bit higher than most of the breakfast places around town but the portion size was good and so was the taste. Sadly, Scramble has committed the biggest sin a restaurant can commit. THEY SHRUNK THE FOOD!! Now, the price is still a bit higher but the omelette is about HALF the size it used to be. This to me is completely unforgivable. Black Bear diner did the same thing several months ago and I have not been back since.       This will be my last time eating at Scramble. It's sad, my mother and I used to eat here almost every weekend. Now that she has passed I don't get here as much. In fact, I haven't been in for about a year. But it's still nice to be able to come in and have a nice breakfast. To bad they ruined that for me. Stop being greedy people. A good value for a good price. That's what keeps people coming back.

Scramble is a  quick-serve breakfast place  where you order at the counter, find a table and wait for a server to bring your food (similar to SAUCE).   The decor is modern, spacious and funky and the place  seems very clean. I noticed that the employees were constantly wiping down counters and tables which is good.  On the food, I ordered the vegetarian omelette with sourdough toast and roasted potatoes.  Although it was good, I think I should have stayed at home and made my own breakfast.   Just seems odd for a vegetarian omelette to have so few vegetables. It looked more like scrambled eggs sprinkled with chopped herbs.   Other than that, it was good. I give them extra star for supporting local businesses, cleanliness and hosting charity events.",

I think I changed my mind about 3 times before settling with the meat lovers scramble. So good !!!! The location is clean and cool. The patio out side is dog friendly (great) and non smoking (even better) they offer wifi for all the tech nerds like myself. Check in got me a free cup of coffee.  Once we the gentleman took our order in the front he repeated it to make sure it was right. I hate getting the wrong food, especially when I'm starving. It was busy for a Sunday so I excepted to wait a while for the food. No even, food came out quick and hot !! And oh man was it good. Constant check ins with the sounding staff to ensure everything was great. I can definitely say I was impressed with this place.  Bathrooms were modern, needed to be checked on. TV's are positioned in the middle of the restaurant which allows for a good view with any seat in the house. The entire restaurant has a modern look that I wouldn't expect from AZ. I would expect a place like this in OC, but I'm glad I stumbled into it.",

My breakfast of choice (as of right now, anyway) is their bacon and mushroom omelet with the roasted potatoes, wheat toast with a dab of butter, and a large iced chai tea. Love! They have lunch options as well, not just breakfast -- come hungry!   If you arrive and the line is out the door, don't worry -- it moves quickly. Place your order, grab your number and find a seat. They bring your meal to you after it's been made.    Seating is available inside or outside on a cute patio. Inside, one end has a couple TVs. For singles, there's great counter seating at the window overlooking the patio. The patio is dog-friendly.",

My friend had the steak and eggs which he said was really good.  I would recommend to the cooks to add more veggies into the scramble but everything else was great!   There's an outside area which is dog friendly; always a plus in my book.  Just be careful because the misters soak the ground and make it super slippery.",

Only issue I have is you have to order and pay when you walk immediately (and tip) before you get any type of service, which was friendly ok at best. Then you have to bring your own drinks to your table? Really!? I couldn't carry my coffee, orange juice, my water, utensils, napkins, jam for toast, hot sauce for my eggs all at once, had to make several trips (not good). What's the point in tipping if I'm not getting any service? Oh yeah, I tipped for them to bring me my food lol :)",

    "text": "This was The Breakfast Club - UYE 2nd meet up, and this time Scramble was picked for the place, it was at 10am on a Sunday, one thing I can say is that people must love Scramble because it was busy from the time we got their to the time we left.  As sometimes I do, I did a little research on the menu and I knew exactly what I wanted to try. The Santa Fe Eggs Benedict, eggs poached lying on top of cured ham with jalapeno corn bread below it and a yellow chipotle hollandaise sauce covering the dish, I also switched out the rosemary potatoes for the sweet potato hash, visually this dish looked freaking fantastic, however everything was lacking in flavor and my poached eggs I think came from a mini hen, barely any egg whites and small yokes,  the ham was good, had great flavor, I had high hopes for the jalapeno corn bread, taste buds were expecting to be hit with bits of jalapenos sadly that didn't happen, just seemed like dry corn bread, oh and the hollandaise sauce, have I told yall how much I love hollandaise sauce, oh high hopes for the sauce too, because cilantro, it has its own unique taste and smell and I just love the stuff, I love how it can go from a spicy dish to a sweet dish and add great flavor to what was already perfect! But the hollandaise sauce didn't have the hint of cilantro, and the sauce itself was lacking flavor, so I will continue my search for the great hollandaise sauce in the valley.  The sweet potato hash, ok I had no idea what to expect on this, it was bland like it needed some salt and pepper, but it was fresh, it had mushrooms, zucchini? and onions sauteed  mixed in with  slices of sweet potatoes, never thought of doing a sweet potato like that, now I know, going to have to try it at home!   I ordered the cinnamon roll too, just to try it, again visually great, but the roll was dry and hard and inedible but the icing was perfect.   Service seemed to be ok, for some tables they were on it and others it was eh, maybe they could work on that too.  I don't think I will go out of my way to come back, I came, I saw, wasn't thrilled, back to the east valley I went.",

After friendly and helpful input from each gal, I ordered the Santa Fe Benedict. It was perfect. Eggs poached easy/med. Corn bread was moist and  a little sweet. Ham was mildly candied. The hollandaise sauce had a little spice with its perfect tang and consistency was like a warm creamy stew! Yum! It was served with hash browns that were seasoned and cooked just right. Although, they were slightly below a fresh hot temp. No problem though.  The rest of the staff was friendly with following up on me. Paige and Sarah both came to check on me as well! They were perfect employees by any fine dining standards.   If I am in Phoenix again I will have to return to try the paninis or the breakfast pizzas!!",

A lady walks up to the other register and says \"Can I help who's next?\" So I walk up to the register with my mom and the lady didn't even acknowledge us. Receipts came up at the register and she sat there staring at them and then grabbed a muffin or something. Then she walked away with it without saying a word. I waited for her to come back and about 10 seconds later another worker asked me if I'd been helped. I told her what happened and all she did was apologize and ask if we wanted coffee with our order. She gave the cup for my mom and told us to order after the people at the other register were done and let her know we got coffee because they aren't supposed to open that register. The people who were BEHIND US in line. What's funny is that now as I sit here in the restaurant they have that second register open that they \"weren't allowed to open.\" I am never coming back here again due to dealing with not only horrible customer service but just plain rudeness from this employee!",

You are on your own for gathering napkins, silverware, straws, etc. but it was super easy to manage and not an issue for me. There are plenty of tvs to give you something to do while you are waiting or you can sit outside and enjoy the beautiful AZ fall weather.  We ordered the meat lovers scramble and the chocolate chip pancakes. We also both had an orange juice which was fantastic. I could have had 2 more glasses but we restrained ourselves. My scramble came wth an English muffin and hash browns. I wasn't a fan of the seasoning on the hash browns and they were only luke warm but my scramble was delicious as was my English muffin. My son had 2 huge chocolate chip pancakes with 2 pieces of bacon. He said the bacon was the best he has ever had. Breakfast was $25.00 not including tip.  We will definitely be returning to try some of the other menu items.",

    "text": "Stopped into Scramble on a Sunday morning. It was very busy so there was a line out the door. The line moved slowly but I guess that gave us time to decide what to order. I decided on the apple energy pancakes and bacon and my husband got the breakfast burrito with an orange juice.  We took a table inside. Since the place was packed, it was pretty noisy. And it took a while to get our food. My pancakes were good, just not what I was expecting. From the description I thought they might be a little crunchier, like have some granola in them, but they were more like a whole grain pancake I guess. And I don't think the syrup was real maple syrup - it was pretty thin. The bacon was decent and the pancakes weren't bad, just not like granolas pancakes I've had other places. My husband said the burrito was good, but again, nothing out of this world. His orange juice said Friday on the bottom of the cup. It was Sunday. Not too old I guess, but certainly not freshly squeezed.  Overall, I doubt we will be back. There was nothing that stood out enough to want it again when there are so many choices here in Phoenix.",

    "text": "I'd say that this is my favorite breakfast place ever! I'm not the biggest fan of breakfast, but Scramble makes me think so. I always order the eggs Benedict, specifically, the Florentine Benedict. I always substitute the English muffin for a biscuit because it makes it more buttery and tasty! This particular Benedict comes with spinach, tomato, poached eggs, and Hollandaise. So refreshing! They also have the best hot chai latte that I've had yet. It's warm and sweet, but not to sweet. You can taste the different flavors that blend together well. It doesn't have an overpowering flavor but it's not just milk. I am sad that Scramble isn't open all day because I find myself craving their chai! Oh, and their hashbrowns, phenomenal! Crunchy, flavorful, and perfect. I'm glad they they put salt and pepper on it. Salt and pepper are basic spices, but many places lack the basics. How sad is that? Long story short, I love Scramble.",

My partner loves the Gouda Brizza and orders it almost every time. I've tried many things on the menu and have never been disappointed.

    "text": "I want to give this place a higher rating because the food that I did get was fairly good, but the overall experience wasn't the best.  First, there are four vegan breakfast items (that you can get all day) and two of them are indicated as having a gluten-free option by substituting with gluten-free bread. HOWEVER, the bread is NOT vegan, as I discovered upon asking when I was placing my order. It doesn't make sense to me to offer a vegan menu item with a non-vegan gluten-free option. I had to settle with not having any bread at all, and I was able to substitute fresh fruit instead of bread ... except the fruit didn't look very fresh at all. The fruit looked like it had been sitting out for who knows how long.  Also, there has to be a better way of ordering your food than their current system. You have to stand in line and place your order at the cashier before sitting down, but during peak breakfast time, the ordering process takes so long that the line ends up getting very long and moves very slowly. The line went out the door when I was there.  That all said, at least my Vegan Mushroom & Spinach Scramble was quite tasty and filling, and I appreciate that they are willing to customize everything about your meal. And the iced Americano I got along with my breakfast was also pretty good, and they have soy milk that you can use in place of dairy milk.",

Arrive early(!) or be prepared to wait a while just like any other breakfast place.   I usually get the dollar buttermilk pancakes (serving of 3) with a side of rosemary potatoes but have tried the veggie omelet, biscuits and gravy, cinnamon roll & French toast. All tasted amazing and are sure to please.   Staff is very friendly and courteous no matter how busy they are.",

It's a little spicy and very flavorful!    So I've eaten here twice and the first time was a year or so ago and I couldn't tell you what I had, but all I remember was that it was good!  So I went back again a couple of weeks ago.  All I have to say is HOLY MOLEY  the Gouda Brizza is insanely good!  I wasn't sure what to expect when I ordered it.  I wanted something different.  I was sick of srambled eggs and bacon for breakfast and I didn't want anything sweet, so I thought I'd give it a try.  So I took a bite into it and it was indulgence at it's finest.  I knew instantly that I would have to do cardio for an hour just to burn a quarter of the calories off from this, but OH man is it worth it!  The egg on it is super thin and is covered with the hollandaise sauce and cheese then topped with bits of bacon sprinkled perfectly everywhere.  Even my 20 month old son who refuses to eat meat ate this and didn't even realize he was eating bacon, because it was soo delicious!  I love this place that they make something that is soo different from anywhere else and they do it really well.  I'm going to have a hard time ordering anything else from their menu!",

    "text": "I've been meaning to Yelp for a looong time now, and after having brunch at Scramble today, I thought it only fitting that I give them my Yelp virginity.  My boyfriend and I arrived around 1pm and it was pretty quiet. There was a young lady at the counter, taking orders, and another stocking juices nearby. Both were very friendly.   I requested a vegan menu (the vegan options didn't seem to be listed on the large menu near the door), which was quickly furnished to me. There were 2 tofu scrambles, a soy chorizo breakfast burrito and french toast as possible choices. I couldn't decide between the veggie scramble or the french toast, so... I ordered both! My boyfriend went with the bacon and mushroom omelet (off the regular menu). We were offered bread options of white, wheat, rye, or an english muffin. The side dishes were fruit or sweet potato hash... and I think a lot of the menu items come with rosemary potatoes, but we both opted for the hash. The cashier gave us our number. It was a beautiful day, so we found a table outside.  In a matter of very few minutes, our food had arrived. I noticed that the vegan items were on red plates to differentiate them. My scramble was yummy, with a good enough amount of veggies in it, and a bit more wet than most other scrambles I've had. I did find myself wishing the portion was a bit larger.   The order of french toast came with 3 good-sized pieces and was super duper good.  The highlight for me, was the amazing sweet potato hash! It's served in a patty and is chock full of onions, zucchini, carrots (I think) and seasoned with rosemary. I've never had anything like it. I highly recommend it.  My boyfriend did seem to enjoy his omelet and definitely agreed with me on the hash.  Scramble is a great place, especially considering their vegan breakfast options, which are far too few-and-far-between in the valley. We will absolutely be back!",

On your typical Saturday morning, breakfast joints can be overpopulated and require a 45 minute wait which normally dissuades me from visiting and causes me to just skip ahead to lunch instead. But this morning, I visited Scramble and I was pleasantly surprised when I saw that not only does Scramble have plenty of seating to accommodate the mass crowds, but it's an order, pay and seat your self style restaurant so it cuts out the dreaded wait time. Everything on the menu looks delicious, especially the brizza! I ended up opting for the veggie scramble with sun dried tomatoes, peppers and cheese and accompanied with roasted potatoes. But the sourdough french toast sounded so delectable that my friends and I decided to split that as well. I'm glad we make the choice to go big or go home because the french toast was worth every bit! The service was relatively quick despite the crowded restaurant and the food was delicious and steaming hot upon arrival.   While visiting, I noticed a sign announcing that Scramble is offering unlimited pancakes through the month of October. Sign me up for that! I also enjoyed the serve yourself unlimited coffee and soda fountain. It kept my thirst quenched while filling my belly with the tasty food. Like I mentioned, the restaurant offers plenty of seating and the atmosphere itself is clean and modern. But be prepared to sit in a less than comfortable seat. The restaurant would deserve an extra star if they had better seats and possibly more booths. But, like I said, the atmosphere was great and I like the fact that you can sit either inside or outside and enjoy the view of the desert mountains.   I can't wait to find my way to CenPho again soon so I can visit Scramble and try other items on the menu!",

Another yelper mentioned the pancakes having too much cinnamon but I did not taste any cinnamon at all and I am not a fan of the popular spice so I would definitely notice an over kill.  The service is always friendly and accommodating, servers that laugh, talk, smile and deliver!  The place is clean, cool and brightly decorated. Not a full service place, you place your order at the counter yet the service does not end at the counter. The staff delivers your food, checks to see if you have everything you need and comes to clear your dishes.  They also frequently bus the beverage area keeping it clean and stocked.

Fluffy, filling and fantastic, these cakes of the pan were! There was an all-you-can-eat special going on and I didn't even go in for a second round (the multigrain pancakes are how they get you!). The pancakes were served with sausage patties that were pretty big and very tasty. After systematically pouring syrup over every part of this delicious dish, I devoured every bite. But that's not all folks! I also got to try some of Scramble's Santa Fe Eggs Benedict. They were also fantastic - served on a southwestern style kind of corn muffin and covered in a delicious hollandaise. A few bites of that and a couple pieces of potato, and my gut threw in the towel! I pretty much left there happy as could be!",

My husband was kind enough to snag a few bites lest I go overboard and eat the whole thing which left me to eat 80% of it. It is $2.89 and a pretty good size cinnamon roll. Before the \"dessert,\" I had the two egg meal ($5.89) which came with toast (I chose an english muffin) and red, rosemary potatoes. I love red potatoes anyway, and to have it as my breakfast potato was a nice treat. Since my daughter already had breakfast, we ordered her a side of the dollar cakes (three small pancakes). I snuck one on my plate, since I love pancakes, but couldn't even go near it after pigging out on the cinnamon roll. As other reviewers mentioned, you order at the front and they bring the food out. Besides a minor incident of the wrong food being brought, our food came out very quickly. The servers walking around were very good at checking on the tables. Oh, how could I forget the soft, giant chocolate chip cookies at the register! Of course I had to get one, although I can't even THINK about sweets after my breakfast dessert. What I need is a good latte to cure my impending sugar crash. But the cookie WILL be eaten later. I really enjoyed my meal here although it is a little far from where we live (midtown Phx). We took 7th St all the way up since there isn't a freeway we could easily access without driving out of the way. But I definitely think Scramble was worth the drive.",

Portions were on the smaller side and the lack of servers (its a walk up register) was a little difficult for a group of 6 non-regulars to decide on an order.  Food was OK, not great, just good.  Plenty of TV's around and very clean.  Not what I think of when I think of a breakfast place though.",

Walk up service, order at the counter, grab your silverware, coffee, water and napkins, and your food is delivered to your table. Food is always fresh and hot, very tasty. They will let you customize your food, I swap turkey sausage for the ham in the Santa Fe benedict, and turkey sausage for the chorizo in the Southwest burrito. You can get fresh fruit or sweet potato hash instead of the rosemary breakfast potatoes. Instead of  the usual toast selection, you can get jalapeno corn bread, biscuits or dollar pancakes, regular or multigrain. Good selection of hot tea, very friendly, helpful staff. Cassie sees us at the door and starts waving hello, welcome back.  Wonderful patio, nonsmoking and dog friendly, they bring your pup its own water bowl.",

Drinks are all self serve.  It is good to have another breakfast alternative.    Previously, I was there for breakfast and had on of the omelets.  Good and filling.  Took 15 minutes or so to get the food.  2/3 of the menu is breakfast with just a few choices for lunch (3 sandwiches, 2 soups and some salads).  On this visit I had the Turkey Sandwich and dining partner had a Breakfast \"Gringo\" burrito.    We did wait about 15-20 minutes again for the food and the place had only 10 people there.  The sandwich was tasty and came with a few chips ($9).  The Burrito ($7)  is large with LOTS (maybe too much) cheese sauce.  He liked it though.  Drinks are pricey ($4 for OJ?).  Bottom Line:  It is a decent breakfast place but I wouldn't go out of my way to lunch there.",

I think my arteries hardened slightly in the midst of digesting but it was worth it. My friend's plate looked equally scrumptious. You're not going to get any fancy coffee there (I was hankering for a latte) but still had a good cup of normal joe.   The staff was nice and pleasant and I really enjoyed the patrons as well - we chatted with quite a few and it just seemed like a really nice upbeat place.

One of the first things they did was bring my dog a styrofoam water dish and gave her pets and lovin' (it was hot and my dog lapped up the water when they put the dog bowl down). I'm a dog mom so this did mean a lot to me. Very impressed all around. Great service, guys.",

Really really good place to go with the kids because the wait time isn't too long for them and we sit outside and the kids play with the wiki-stix they provide.

Seeing as it was our first time, she was incredibly helpful and answered all our questions. This is all before we stepped foot in the place! Great start!   Once we got inside, we went to the counter and ordered and paid right away. The young woman working at this station was also enthusiastic, kind and helpful! Such a change of pace from the rude and useless service that's so prevalent nowadays. It was definitely impressive. Good job on the customer service guys!   We sat down in the comfortable group atmosphere and didn't have to wait long for our food. When it came to our table it was hot and tasted good. Self serve coffee was nice as well.   Overall, I really enjoyed my experience. The food is pretty basic breakfast fare (except maybe the breakfast pizzas, which looked good) so the service, value and atmosphere was going to have to win us over and it did. The only thing I wondered about was tipping since we paid up front with a card. I didn't put a tip on the card because I didn't know how the wait service would be but seeing that it was good, I left cash on the table. Just kinda confusing if you're using a card but no big deal. Great job Scramble! I'll be back!!",

It turned out there is one cashier station at which all the orders are taken before you can be seated.  The result was we stood in line for 30 minutes as we looked out over a room of mostly empty tables.  I had the southwest omelet, which came with toast (I had sourdough) and hashbrowns.  The omelet had a lot of flavor - but it was a little dry.  The pico de gallo on top didn't add any moisture, which would have been nice.  The toast and hash browns were also good.  The setting is casual and comfortable, with  a very nice patio.  The service once we were seated was very good.  I would go back - but not being one for standing in line for half an hour when most of the tables are empty - I would not stay if I saw the line was more than halfway to the front door.  They would greatly benefit from a second cashier station.",

They also change it up a bit and offer some interesting twists on breakfast classics.  I went for the biscuits and gravy - so Delish! Its the real deal with fluffy biscuits and homemade gravy with chunks in it! Chunks of real sausage people, not that watered down crap from a can with processed sausage nuggets!  Stop by when you get a chance, its Great!",

I had a southwest omelet and cleared my plate, my son had the French Toast which he said is the best he has ever had. The prices are great and I got a free cup of coffee just for checking in. The kids meals came with Wikki Stix which kept my kids entertained until our plates arrived at our table. The service was friendly and quick.  Very clean restrooms too. I highly recommend this place.",

So far, everything's been good (although as someone who doesn't like rosemary potatoes in the first place, I can only call those 'passable'), although the one-size no-refill OJ (though most places don't refill orange juice these days) is a bit dinky.  Also, it's close to North Mountain, which is great for all the hike-then-breakfast people out there.  The prices are a bit steep, but if you get a punch card, you also get a 10% discount on your bill each time.  Yay discounts!  The TVs actually show different stuff - sports, soap operas, Spongebob - just seat your family accordingly and everyone will be happy.  Also, the coffee can be incredibly hot.  Burned my tongue pretty badly on it last time I went.  However, it was still good coffee.  If you're on the fence about the place, give it a shot - just remember to get a punch card too.",

Walk Up Order - Initially scheptical but soon realized it allowed everyone to place their order in the correct order they arrived.  Very efficient. Service - Friendly and timely.  This is not McDonald's so don't expect to have your food in 3 minutes.  Freshly made food, and tasty, takes time. Atmosphere - The TVs gave a nice distraction to watch the morning news and sports to pass the time.  Multiple TVs allowed enough viewing for all types.  If I were a restaurant investor, I would love the chance to franchise a few locations.  Food was excellent!  My wife and kids loved it and wanted to go back the next day. The portions were big and more than satisfying.  We all ordered slightly different items and they were all prepared well.  The Santa Fe Eggs Benedict was rediculously good.  We were visiting from out of town for a football playoff for pop warner.  Lucky to drive past and stop in.  I also purchased a coffee mug and traveler mug because the design and colors were great.",

I super dig the potatoes, and my eggs were perfect. Wifey and I both threw down on the awesome cinnamon roll, which was great!  I'll definitely be back, what a killer breakfast",

We later moved inside, but I won't get into that....  Ordered the meat lovers scramble, and a Toluca \"brizza\", or breakfast pizza, and a cinammon roll.  The scramble was pretty tasty, but nothing phenomenal.  The brizza was different. It had a nice flavor to it, but I probably wouldn't order it again.  The cinnamon roll was sooooo good. It has a thick layer of icing, piled into a cavity, surrounded by cinnamony goodness.  That was one of the best cinnamon rolls I've ever had. So good.  A bit pricier than Denny's, for similar fare, but not unbearably expensive.  I will probably go back, because it's good food, and five minutes from the house.",

Cute place, nice and bright with lots of seating inside and out.  The have large menus on the wall for you to read while standing in line.  They have much to choose from, and for the veg-folk, they have four different vegan options!! I swoon over their vegan French toast, with syrup, Smart Balance, and a side of fruit (but I always order it with the sweet potato hash cause that's better! It's sweet pots mixed with mushrooms and zucchini and rosemary).  They serve vegan items on specific vegan plates and cook with a separate grill, how rad is that?  I truly appreciate their consideration.  Once while I was in there, I had a chance to chat with the owner, and I asked if he was vegan.  He said that he wasn't but that his brother is, so he tries hard to be conscious of the non-animal eating people, and also said that if there was anything that I thought would be good to eat, to let him know and he'd check it out.  Coooool!!",

It makes it easier to go with friends, deal with the child (especially if a quick escape is necessary), and just makes things a little bit more laid back.  Even though you order at the counter, their wait staff is still attentive to you and clears your plates as you finish.  So nice!  The egg-related artwork and quotes are amusing and the decor is simple, modern and fresh.  Favorite bites: Southwestern Burrito, Santa Fe Eggs Benedict, French Toast, Cheesy-Bacon Hashbrowns, \"Dollar Cakes\" (3 medium-sized pancakes for $1.89! A STEAL!).  Less-than-favorite bites: Costa Burrito (unpleasantly surprised that it didn't have eggs... just tons of potatoes inside WITH a side of potatoes... really?) and the Brizza... a tad bland.  A HUGE plus is Scramble's commitment to seeking out local products - way to go!  Bring a group of friends, or just yourself and your laptop to enjoy the free WiFi while you partake of a delicious meal and great service.  You'll be glad you did!",

    "text": "Ok, maybe I was hungry and swayed by the easy parking, great modern design, nice outdoor eating space, friendly staff and good food. But, who wouldn't give this a 5. What a great way to have a breakfast spot. Walk up to the counter, order, get your own coffee, drinks, condiments, etc, and choose your seat. If your coffee gets low, you just get it. Need more water? It's all right there. How many times at a regular restaurant have you said that you wished you could just refill your own drink yourself, because you would not have to wait? Probably many times or you just got upset. Here you go.   This place has great modern decor with nice colors and accents. I noticed it right away when we walked in. Not what you would expect from the outside, a pleasant surprise.   There are menus on the wall and menus up above and printed menus if you want something you can hold to read and choose your fare. We opted for a veggie scramble with zucchini, yellow squash, and hold the onions for me, a Santa Fe Benedict (thanks to all the fantastic yelp reviews) and two coffees. We signed up for a frequent visitor card and even got an extra 10% off. Woohoo, always welcomed. It came to just $20 for the two of us.  We chose our seats, near a power outlet so that I could charge my phone, and got comfortable. I made a trip to the restroom to find a very upscale modern bathroom that I was quite impressed by. Not necessarily fitting of a breakfast spot, but totally appropriate with all the other modern decor.   Our breakfast seemed to take a little while, but looked great when it arrived. The quantity of food seemed pretty good for the price and everything looked and tasted very fresh. I was very pleased with my choice of veggie scramble and thoroughly enjoyed it. SG loved his benedict and I even got to sample it. Not being a poached egg fan, I was skeptical, but I got very little yolk in my taste. The sauce was delicious, I definitely understand all the yelp. Both of us enjoyed our coffees and had no problem getting up to refill. Especially since we do not really like our coffees refilled mid cup, it just messes up the chemistry.  This place is a little tucked away from the freeway and not super convenient to drive to when you are just in town visiting, but its only just under 10 minutes detour for a fantastic breakfast. Well worth it. We will likely be back.",
