Norteno is really about take out though. That keeps them busy. Hey people know!",

It isn't very close to me and if I am driving to this side of town it is usually for a safe bet.  I finally was in the area and a friend recommended we go there for a quick bite.  The setting is order at the window and take to go or sit in their patio.  I ordered some nachos and my son got a carne asada quesadilla.  The food was made fresh and the price was the same as any fast food Mexican joint in the valley.  The nachos were on par with any \"bertos\" as was the quesadilla.  The salsa was also decent but again on par with every other fast food place around.  For all the 5 star reviews I had much higher expectations.  It was good but not great.  I do not think I would go out of my way to come back or highly recommend to others.",

Their Enchilada Platter won me over and I've been back several times.  Make no mistake, this place looks like a dive...and it is. TASTY Mexican food though, with quick service, reasonable prices, in a convenient location. Their Breakfast Burrito is HUGE, delicious and a bargain at $3.75. Their rice and beans won't disappoint either.  Breakfast, lunch, dinner, or late nite snack, El Norteno gets the job done.",

The first was a couple of months ago when my office sent me out for take out. I was not the only one feeling it then. Last Friday was the last straw though, though. It's a fair weather favorite as it's not air conditioned and we went again. My boss was sweating after the meal and I felt a chili eaters superiority - until a few hours later when I felt my gut burning. And I like it hot!  He said he didn't feel good then either. Up until now I'd never made a bad lunch selection for him. That record is hosed.   The other person with us had intended to take part of the generous portion home, but trashed the rest after all.",

The style of food reminds me of the bad old days in the 80s, before anyone on the east coast (where I grew up) had a taste for authentic regional Mexican. Maybe this is an authentic style in Mexico (perhaps Norteno style?) I'm not an authority. But to me it ate like a nasty gringo version of Tex-Mex, which is not something I enjoy. It certainly was affordable, at least. The \"eat-in\" area is pretty run down; damaged, sagging tables and not all that clean. My wife said it felt like we were in a prison yard on visitors day. She had a point. Food wasn't disgusting, but given the huge number of better options nearby, I wouldn't recommend El Norteno.",

I felt like I was ripping them off so I ordered a green tamale. The red chili was hotter than a lot of them out there. But it also had this fantastic creamy texture that made the red chili just melt with the meat in your mouth or rolled in a tortilla. As you read all the reviews it is cash only. There is a tiny little building adjacent with eight booths to sit in. If you were looking for a fancy dining area or even a standard indoor dining area get your food to go because this place cannot accommodate your needs. I ate in the booths and it was a little warm in the dead of summer.",

The dining area is only outside and well shaded.  They are cash only.  I'd go into detail about the food, but I've only been in the southwest for 6 years so almost all of the good mexican places blow my mind with how good they are.  Their chorizo is the better kind.  The kind with substance, not just oil with red food coloring like at filibertos.",

Just hit the freaking ATM before you go and stop whining. They have a huge menu, so large it takes up a good portion of one of the walls of the phone booth sized area you order from inside. The tortillas are so fresh they could easily go head to head with Carolina's. The red chili is by far the best I've ever had, as noted by some fellow yelpers. Don't miss their homemade taco sauce (I think they just call it hot sauce). You'll want to buy a quart to take home.   Don't let the exterior fool you. This place is top notch, with very friendly staff that will take good care of you. Stop by and take it home, if you can, but once you get a whiff of it, I challenge you not to pull over and devour it before you ever get on the freeway.",

    "text": "Although this little hole in the wall is a good, genuine Mexican style cafe, the quality of the food varies from night to night. We went there five times and each time the food changed from the time before. The first experience was okay - the food was what other yelpers said - genuine, decent quality, etc.   The following visits weren't all they could have been - everything from a pair of couples making out in the parking lot while loud music played to the couple who were most DEFINITELY fighting to the almost collision which we were witness to while waiting for our food.  I tried the pollo fun dido and my boyfriend had the combo platter with taco, enchilada, and tostada. The food was hot, fresh, and had that \"Mexican\" flair/flavor to it, as advertised.   On another trip, I had the carne asada fries and he had the same combo platter with something small on the side. LOTS of food - the portions are very generous for the prices so no complaint there.   Different night, different menu choices - I tried the shredded beef chimichanga with rice and beans - we added chips once or twice - everything was edible, nothing went to waste.  Any suggestions I may have? Perhaps longer hours on Friday and Saturday nights - you know, for us late night noshers. They close at 10 pm most nights and at 8 on Sunday. I appreciate the desire to take only cash for transactions, but I think this is probably a crimp in some people's ability to pay - not everyone carries cash! However that being said, the bookkeeper in me sees a lot of issues with the cash method.   We give them 3 stars because they aren't terrible but they sure don't compare to our beloved La Canasta down the way on 7th Ave.",

There is no place to sit inside so your forced to sit in an enclosed area outside that is attached to the side of the building. Seeing that its Arizona makes it really hard when it comes to summer and sitting outside.  I ordered the Sonoran Enchiladas which were amazing. It came with beans and rice which were also amazing. I will say that it was a bit spicy even without adding their hot sauce (which was ooooh so good). I also had their tamales which were so-so. I have had better tamales but they were decent enough to order again.  The horchata was decent, but again ive had better. Its not as strong as other horchatas, its very weak in taste. If thats something your into then you will enjoy this horchata.  Everything was decently priced, but its CASH ONLY. Something to keep in mind when coming.  The reason for my 3 stars instead of 5, is for the simple fact that they lacked a little in customer service. The lady who took my order seemed like she didnt want to be there or help answer any questions knowing it was our first time. She also continued to help others while avioding some people including me. Worth a try, but dont be shocked at the customer service.",

For being inconveniently located, having poor seating selection, and only accepting cash, it's not worth the bother.  As the name states they serve Northern style Mexican food, kind of like most taco joints in Phoenix.  From Carne Asada fries to Sonoran style enchiladas, they run the normal gamut you'd find at any local 'Bertos, or Betos for that matter.  In terms of quality it's very middle of the road and a bit of a mess.  For starters my order of carne asada fries contained random chips, soupy guacamole, and very bland carne asada.  Then my wife's cheese enchilada contained meat, plastic like cheese and a mess of sour cream everywhere.  I can't say it was terrible food, but I could get double the portion for a bit more cash and not need to hit up an ATM up just to eat Mexican food.  Beyond that I must reiterate, the location is very inconvenient and good luck if you're looking for parking when it's busy.  So please do yourself a favor, if it's packed and youre craving Sonoran style Mexican food, just keep driving.  You'll find a spot of similar quality sooner or later.",

They have a small chips and salsa which is more like a large for only $2 bucks! So for $8 I got something for myself that my husband actually had to help me finish because it was so much food! Watch their daily specials that they have for breakfast, lunch and dinner. You can never go wrong with any of them! Especially the prices they have for the specials I mean lunch for under 5 bucks! One thing to know they only take CASH so don't forget it!",

    "text": "Dammit El Norteno, why must your enchiladas be so amazing?!    Do not let the exterior fool you, hidden inside the unassuming facade is a genie that grants all your Mexican food wishes.    This place is literally the size of a postage stamp.  It has a walk-in area to place orders at that becomes crowded once the line reaches 3 people, and an outside walk-up window.  There are a couple of plastic tables and chairs by the window, and a partially enclosed patio area with some more tables and seating.    There is no inside seating.  I know this is important to some people, but I get most of my food to go so this is not an issue for me.  This is a cash only establishment.  It's worth the trip to the ATM, trust me.   There is no drive thru.  I wasn't kidding when I said this place is small.  They have some of the BEST enchiladas I have ever had; seriously, in the top 2.  I don't know what is so magical about that red sauce, but I would bottle it and sell it.     You will NEVER leave this place hungry.  I recently stood in line behind 2 hipsters on bikes and listened to them order an alarming amount of food, then look wildly perplexed about how they would get this much food home on their bikes....amateurs.  They have specials for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.  Taco Wednesday is sheer shenanigans, but worth the reward if you persevere; 2 shredded beef tacos, rice and beans for $4.99.    See ya next wendnesday El Norteno!  :)",

The green chili chimi, enchilada style is simply unbeatable. $5.50 gets you a chimichanga the size of an 8 week old child, smothered in enchilada sauce, cheese, sour cream, and guacamole... WHO DOES THAT!?   There is seating in the style of Mexican Street food with a covered patio that is in the no frills parking lot. If you came for frills, though, you are in the wrong place.

There is only outside seating, on a make-shift patio. There is the occasional loiterer who will ask for change or food, so it is best for take-out and to-go orders. But eating there is not bad. It is right around the corner from me and part of my neighborhood. There are always people there, and having eaten there often, I know why. My only complaint is they are cash only.",

My only complaint ; there were a few stray pieces of meat in the sauce that covered the chili and I am vegetarian, no biggy really,  just picked them out and moved on. The inside area where you order is kinda tiny, but they have an outside window where you can wait until your order is up. We stayed and sat on the patio to eat which was cozy and surprisingly quiet considering it is right off of a main street. I will definitely keep this in my list of places for a yummy fast lunch while at work. Keep in mind though, CASH ONLY!",

I walked by the drunk residentially challenged native person and proceded to the inside to see what they had to offer. The smells were inviting once inside. I ordered a carnitas burrito and some chips and salsa and a horchata to help tame the heat that I was looking for in my burrito. Once I was situated in front of my carnitas burrito I was saddened to see that they had put carne asada in my burrito instead of carnitas. The burrito was tasty none the less and the salsa was delicious and the horchata was cold, and perfectly sweet.

But I went to El Norteno today after a long time (about 2 years) and was thrilled to see it still cranking out the best red chile I've tasted anywhere.  Yes, Matt K, I read your review and you panned it pretty good.  Tortillas not as good as Taco Bell.  Ok Matt, you could NOT have tried the red chile burrito.  This assertively spiced, hearty concoction absolutely tantalizes the taste buds.  It is a bit hot but not painfully so... but the flavor washes over you like waves on the Huatulco beaches.  Grab a side of creamy, smooth refried beans and some of their red salsa (redolent with the smoky flavor of Mexican cumin) and you will be hooked.  As far as the \"atmosphere\" goes, I'm not a big fan of the outdoor dining this time of year (August) so I get it to go.  But I've eaten there in November and it's fine.    Mexican food lovers, Carolina's lovers, TRY THIS PLACE.  You like hole in the wall Mexican, this roadside gem delivers big flavors at little prices.  Matt K can have his Taco Bell.  I'll take El Norteno.",

Yuck, it was almost impossible to find the lettuce underneath the gobs of beans and sour cream. They do charge extra if you want chicken though, and I only got a few shreds of chicken, so I don't quite get the $1.75 upcharge. Skip the taco salad, unless of course you want gobs of beans and sour cream, then this is the dish for you! my friend ordered carne asada street tacos, and then meet had no flavor, no spice, just had that yucky meat flavor. Skip those too.",

I walked in and ordered a Number 1... so a tamale and an enchilada. Shouldn't be too difficult. Unfortunately, the ordering process was the end of my positive experience though. I sat down in their covered patio to wait for my food.  While I was waiting, a meth addict came in to give herself a shower with the wet wipes they provide on their garbage can. The entire time she was muttering profanity under her breath, and tweaking out. She wasn't really causing any problems or confronting anyone directly, but her presence seemed to put the entire patio on edge. She was in one of those mindsets of having to excessively clean everything, particularly her hands. Unfortunately, the restaurant did nothing to care for her, remove her from the premises, or ask her to stop swearing despite the amount of children also in the area.   After sitting on edge for fifteen minutes, my order finally showed up. It looked really good! Until I took my first bite and found the centre of the tamale to be cold :( After waiting so long for the food, I was pretty disappointed to have it still be cold when I got it. The flavors were a little bland as well.  Unfortunately, I think this is the end of my excursions to El Norteno. There are too many good Mexican places in the area to get cold food and not be able to relax while eating it.",

The food here is more than legit. I got a mixed red and green chili pork chimichanga with rice and beans to go...... This thing weighed no less than 3 pounds....it was insane! Also, it cost less than 10$ (cash only...wah wah). It was more than enough for the husband and I to share. The flavor was delightful. The salsa they included was spicy, the chilis were rich and flavorful.... It was like heaven in a styrofoam box. I'll be back!!!",

I've seen it almost weekly on my commute home from ASU night classes and we finally made it in a few weeks ago.  This is the kind of Mexican restaurant I truly relish.  It's the small informal business that I feel is the best way to enjoy some good Mex-American cooking.  As a vegetarian, this restaurant isn't my best friend, but it is manageable.  I ended up ordering a bean and green chili chimichanga.  It was just what it needed to be -- fried, fatty and comforting.  The horchata was really great, too, and I'm picky about my rice water ;)  Cost is low.  Service is minimal.  Ambiance is one step away from full on street dining.  Think old burger joint yellow tables and bench seats, asphalt and plastic trellis walls.  If you're looking for something fancy, turn around.  If you're looking for something to hit the spot, without any pretense, run in this direction!",

    "text": "Best red chili in town. Others have beat me to it, and it's no wonder. Norteno has been serving simple Tex-Mex with local flair since 1981. It's not much to look at, for sure. After driving by for so many years, I finally gave it a whirl and ordered take-out for five to sample its many specialties.  What overwhelms is that it is home made, right there in that little building. You have to wonder how they do it, but damn! Sorry, Sylvia's. You've been de-throned.  My tastes included the red chili beef chimichanga, then smothered with more of the delicious rich red sauce. Even fried, the flour tortilla was somehow still moist and the minced beef melted like butter in my mouth. I added rice and beans like any gringo should. Yeah, the cheese on the beans was not melted by the time I got home, but how could it be? And unfortunately the stock used in the rice was not fresh, possibly cubed or powdered because its taste was explosive in some bites, absent in others. Rice was overcooked, but it was freshly made, not served for days and days after the batch was made like other places... nice.  The salsa was not the usual \"picktwosyllables\"-berto's watery vinegar, but its ground chili was brilliant. Makes a great addition to any dish: douse heavily for best results.  Norteno makes their own chorizo, and it does not disappoint. Difficult to get excited about toenails, snouts, lips and assholes, but it's Mexican Spam, and it's home made!  The only puzzle for me is that after almost 30 years they haven't got their act together for a proper dining area or a better location. Diners must take orders to go, or sit in the lean-to at tables and seating from Kyoto Bowl under bad florescent lighting. I think the owner's going over to My Florist to have a look at the space. A bit much glass for me, but it's close to her original location anyway.",

    "text": "Can I give two separate ratings?  The two is an average of my two stops, for which I'd give it a 5 and a 0.  Obviously the 5 visit came first or I wouldn't have been back.  The first trip was great!  My plane landed and I yelped for taqueria's (after 3 months in NJ following a year in SoCal I was dying for good mexican) this place was close to the airport with good reviews so I figured I'd give it a try.  Fantastic, simple, cheap and delicious.  The hot sauce was great, so tasty.    This was therefore our logical dinner stop on our way back to the airport after a week and a half traveling around arizona and utah.    I tried to order the \"grande burro\" with beans instead of the meat.  I am a vegetarian, but I wanted the lettuce, tomato, and guacamole instead of just beans and cheese.  After 5 minutes of discussion, trying to explain this (the girl at the counter spoke perfect english, I don't know why no meat was so confusing) she convinced me to just get a bean and cheese burrito.  Fine whatever, so I got a bean and cheese burrito.  Or so I thought.  I cut into it (sitting in my car in the parking lot b/c they had closed the seating area for the night) and found a chunk of meat.  So I brought it back, and told her that I didn't want meat.  She was incredibly nice and very apologetic and had the cook re-make it \"without\" meat.  At this point I'm looking at my watch wondering if we're making our plane.  My boyfriend finished his food before I got back to the car.  So I come back with a new burrito (and no new salsa since I'd dumped the salsa they'd given me onto the first burrito before seeing the meat :( ), dig into it and not seeing any meat, we drive off.  Munching along while driving, I came across the meat.  The rest of my burrito went into the trash at the car rental return place and I went home hungry and disappointed.",

Hot Sauce is amazingly good to the point that we finished the entire bottle they gave us for sit-in. Takeout orders get 2 extremely small containers per burrito which is not nearly enough. Important to note that there is no salsa bar.  Location: Close to the airport (less than 5 miles) and very small. Place your order inside then wait for it outside. A small eating area is available attached to the kitchen. Nothing fancy or special, but heck, its cheap.  Service: The first time around we received our orders as requested. The second time, my GF who is vegetarian received a burrito with meat inside despite clearly indicating 'no meat'. This was during closing time and they were surprised when she came back to demand a new burrito saying 'you didnt eat that outside cause its closed?'. Clearly they were more concerning about closing up than just having given a customer a wrong order. Then on the way to the car rental, the replacement burrito was also discovered to have meat inside. It was immediately thrown into the garbage by my disappointed GF. Completely unacceptable and a 3 star demerit.  While the food was good, we probably would not come here again due to not wanting food to go to waste (when we receive items with meat inside when requested without) and lack of hot sauce / salsa when doing take out.",

Plates include rice and beans and are reasonably priced for a LOT of food. Douse everything in salsa and be prepared for a good time!  -1 star for cash only policy.

    "text": "Is it fair to dock a star for not accepting credit cards?  That's of course a rhetorical question that could fill up Yelp Talk threads for weeks.  For me, the answer is yes and the main reason I stayed away from El Norteno for so long despite living just down the road.  Look, I never have cash on me and 99% of businesses these days accept cards.  Hell even the vending machines at my office take cards now.  So its an inconvenience for me to find a branch of my bank, grab a twenty and then go somewhere.  You may disagree with me, but that's my stance and I'm sticking to it.  So you may ask what finally got me over here?  Glad you asked.  The short answer is the Phoenix New Times.  Of all the Mexican joints the New Times staff tried throughout the entire valley, the consensus amongst their staff was that El Norteno had the best Machaca Chimichanga in the entire valley for 2018.  Oh, really?  Finally, on the way home from work on a Wednesday, I bit the bullet, stopped at an ATM, and then came to El Norteno.  Residing on the northwest corner of 7th Avenue and Roosevelt, El Norteno takes up space at one of Downtown's busiest intersections.  Which probably explains the lines I typically see after work here.  The building is a dive, seating is scarce, and getting in and out of here during the work day is a task.  But nevertheless this place is busy every time I drive by.  Latino, white, black, white collar, blue collar, rich, poor, every walk of life comes here.  Today was no different and I walked up to place my order.  Here you walk inside to a tiny ordering counter, give them your order, pay cash, get your number, and then wait outside.  I ordered the #14, a Chimichanga with beans and rice.  You've got a bunch of meats to choose from, but I took the New Times' advice and ordered Machaca.  Total cost including tax?  $9.  Took about 10 minutes as there were about 8 other orders prior to mine.  As what little seating here was in use, I got mine to go.  So did this chimi live up to the hype?  Well, its complicated.  The portion of the chimi was big as I expected, but they totally drenched my chimi in guac and sour cream.  I certainly love guac and sour cream, but I should've asked for them to put it on the side.  By the time I dug into my chimi, the shell was already a wet mess with only a slight crunch.  The beans were also just meh and tasted basically like bean puree.  Now I will say the machaca and the rice were both excellent and particularly good when mixed with the cream and guac.  So it wasn't an unpleasant meal at all.  On the whole, I would say this chimichanga measures up fairly evenly with Rito's (14th St & Roosevelt), but I will side with Dominic Armato of the AZ Republic that Carolina's (12th St & Mohave) has the best chimi in Downtown Phoenix (and possibly the entire valley).  El Norteno certainly gets the job done in terms of delivering a hearty inexpensive meal with some high points.  But between the Cash Only rule and the so-so taste, I probably wouldn't make another ATM run just for the pleasure of a meal here.  Rito's too used to be cash only, but their business boomed once they joined the credit card movement.  Here's hoping El Norteno will join that revolution.",

I went late at night before they were closing and the place looked sketchy but the food made up for it.   I was craving some tamales and they had that plus more. The carne asada fries here is decent and price is great compared to Federico's and Filibertos they charge $10+ after tax. The carne asada fries here was only $6.50 before tax and after came out to be about $7.10. I only wish I had tried it when it came out instead of when it got home because they packaged it in a round aluminum bottom with paper top. By the time I got it home the fries were all soggy (Bummer)  I would definitely come back and try some other things.",

The location in downtown Phoenix is close to my office and very convenient and the food was very good. I ordered chips and salsa, a machaca chimichanga w rice and beans and the polo fundido with rice and beans. In regards to the chips and salsa, the chips were okay and the sals was very good. It had a nice heat note with solid pepper and cumin flavor. Different than normal salsa. As for the chimi, which many list as the best in the valley, I have to say that it was good but not amazing. Now that I think about it, I never have had an amazing chimi. Is it even possible to have such a thing? It was good though. The side of rice and beans were tasty and enjoyed. The real winner for the night was the pollo fundido. Hands down the best I have ever had. It was so flavorful, creamy, and savory with a little heat kick. Just a perfect dish and would recommend. Only real negative is they are cash only. In this day and age, that makes no sense to me and forcing me to drive to the bank before dinner was a little annoying. Overall, will go back for sure and when I do, there will be more than one order for the pollo fundido.",

I have never had enchilada sauce as amazing as this one here. I only have one more day in Phoenix and I will most definitely be stopping here before heading back home. This is officially my favorite Mexican food in Phoenix!  Update:  I went back again today before going back home to Seattle and it was even better than yesterday.

Deal with it. All the food was fairly mediocre and not at all impressive. Both the green chile and enchilada sauce had a gravy-like consistency and almost had some flavor familiarities as well. The masa of the tamale was a bit dry, and did not have the sweetness I have come to love. Not much to say about the taco and tostada, pretty standard Sonoran fare, but I have had much better elsewhere.  Now to the staples. This is where they earned a few points. While none were stellar, the beans, rice, and flour tortillas were pretty good. The tortillas tasted homemade, but could be purchased from a local tortilleria. They also stay open later than most restaurants in Phoenix.  Also, worth a mention the only area to eat is an enclosure bordered by some walls and security doors on either side. It almost feels like you're in jail and I imagine its sweltering on a hot summer day. If you've had a few stints in tent city you will feel right at home (minus the pink underwear).",

If you don't mind walking up to the window and either taking your treasure home or sitting on their silly patio, then this is your place. One of the things I grew to hate was that I moved into an apartment down the street and signed a year lease, before I actually knew what I was getting into. One must find balance in one's life, but that was very hard for me to do, once I'd had their red chili, pollo fundido and carne asada (Which has never been my favorite. It is, now.) plates. I'd only had pollo fundido at one other place, which will remain nameless because I still love it...but it was consistently burnt. Not so at El Norteno. I will guestimate that I ordered food there at LEAST 50 times whilde I had my little place. My orders were never easy, always high-maintenance. In the entire time of our relationship, they got something wrong on my order exactly twice. That is an impeccable record, trust me.   Besides having absolutely wonderful food, the staff was always friendly and often remembered the changes in my order. I was gone this whole summer and of all the restaurants I love, this one was the one I craved. El Norteno, I will take full responsibility for the extra 25 pounds I carry around now, but damnit, it was because I couldn't stay away!",

It's pretty easy to miss on the corner of 7th Ave and Roosevelt but it's worth every penny. I made the mistake of forgetting my cash (cash only) the first time I tried to stop here, but I cannot believe how affordable Norteno's food is.  They offer a lunch and dinner special everyday of the week (except for weekends it looks like), along with quite a few other specials and of course a normal selection of tacos, burritos, quesadillas, nachos, etc. I'd be prepared to take it back somewhere else as their seating selection is small, and outdoor (though it is enclosed), which can be sort of hot in the summer.   I personally had the chile relleno special which came with beans, rice, and a tortilla as well as a drink for $4.99. The chile relleno was perfectly fried, smothered in a verde sauce, and saturated with cheese from within. The beans and rice were also excellent and hearty, some of the best I've had downtown. Based on other reviews, I'll definitely be back to try their red and green chile beef.  Overall I would definitely recommend this place, especially for lunch if you're working downtown. Don't be scared off by its appearance, Norteno offers excellent Mexican food.",

    "text": "Let's be honest here...  the place looks scary from the outside, it's in a revitalization part of town, and it's cash only.  The staff can be rude (think soup nazi from Seinfeld) and the wait can be horrible at times.  There is no indoor seating and parking is crazy during the lunch rush.  But on the flip side, the food makes it all worth while once you can get past all of the pitfalls.  I love a good cheese enchilada and this place has them.  They make them the way I like them, baked... not just a tortilla with cheese and sauce thrown together like other fast food mexican restaurants (the 'Bertos chains ain't got nothin' on this place!).   I crave them constantly.  I've never had a bland or yucky enchilada from them.  Their shredded beef tacos are amazing, but every now and then they come out super greasy.  But who doesn't like a greasy taco?  The chile relleno is very tasty, but every now and then the seeds get in the way.  There is just something about the cheese and sauce that keeps me eating it, spitting out the chili seeds as I go along. The prices are reasonable, especially the lunch specials.  I've eaten there at least 30 times in the past two years and haven't regretted it once.  To each his own, but the folks who have left negative reviews about the service must not know the place or the system.  You have to play their game and understand that there are enough of us who love their food to outweigh any business lost from people who expect superior service.  Just an honest observation... not trying to say their reviews aren't accurate, they probably are right on point.  Bad things probably happen, but when you find awesome food that you can't get anywhere else, you learn to accept being treated like a number.  Bottom line, amazing food, iffy service, horrible location, worth the trip for takeout.",

I got a little nervous when I pulled up and I saw that the restaurant was more of a four walled building with an oven inside than an actual sit down place, but I was not disappointed. Big portions, great taste, and good value.  Only drawback is that the sitting area isn't air conditioned so in the summer it gets pretty toasty and there are a number of flies buzzing at your plate. Nevertheless, the food is awesome and I'll definitely be going back.",

    "text": "Why do I have to love El Norteno so much? Why?  Why can't I find their red chile to be  anything but perfection...spicy red sauce so good I would eat it without meat, hot or cold, with our without a tortilla, with or without a utensil if need be.  If I left a burrito in my car in July and found it a week later, I would likely still eat it, and just suffer the consequences later.  The green chile is a close second, though.  Best to get both.  And a Mexican coke...they carry the big 16 oz bottles.  I did try the machaca, and while it was pretty good, I still wished it were actually dried meat.  But they do put the meat on the grill after cooking to dry it out a bit, so it's closer to the way I like it.  They make a great shredded beef taco, too.  Meat that's not overly seasoned and a freshly fried taco shell.  I guess you could get a soft taco, but really, what's the point?  I also got a plate last time, just to try the beans and rice.  Beans were good, but I could do without.  I do like that they don't put peas & carrots in their rice.  What is the point of that anyway?  It's not like you need to stretch rice because it is so expensive.  And is eating a tablespoon of vegetables going to undo the fact that I just consumed 9,000 calories?  But my biggest question is why does it have to be so damn far away?  Oh, I know.  Because if it was in Scottsdale, they would have to charge $11.99 for a burrito, and it would suck anyway.  I now find myself making a lot more donations to the Humane Society thrift store in Sunnyslope...just a quick drive down 7th Avenue on my way home.  Sort of.",

But warning, don't come here expecting anything other than a supercharged 'Bertos experience.  And when I say this, I'm making the clear distinction that the food here is awesome.  The enchilada sauce, the red chile and the green chile are super on point.  The beans are pretty good, not on that Carolina's level but close.  Tacos are head and shoulders above tons of other places.    There is no place to sit.  The only seating area is a little shack type area with old school booths, gated style good walls and an a/c that serves it's purpose but this is Phoenix and it's flippin hot.  There's about 8 booths in there.    My go-to is the 3-Way burro which is red chile, green chile and beans.  It's the best.  They have a 2-Way which is just red and green plus they have the line up of usual suspects that are all done nicely.  Grande Burro is on my list of future orders.  For this type of fast food, Sonoran style Mexican restaurant, I do feel El Norteno is doing it right.  Go there.",

El Norteno if my very favorite place to get a really great AFFORDABLE meal. When I say affordable, I mean Filiberto's affordable but the food is like you'd expect from a old school restaurant. The girl that works the counter is very friendly and helpful with suggestions.  I'd eat their Steak Picado plate every day of the week. Seriously. Their beans and rice are perfection. So are the tortillas. Green chile is super hot but can't be beat. The red sauce is great too. Order a side of chips and sauce!  Downsides:  The tiny ordering area indoors. No big deal but everyone seems to want to loiter inside making it hard to squeeze in there to place an order. I get it, it's hot out but c'mon y'all, be considerate and let others in to order. There is a small window on the outside you can use but it's usually used to pass out the orders.   The sketchy outdoor eating area. It just doesn't look clean. We always take our food to go and head over to a park to enjoy our food.   Other than that... BEST MEXICAN FOOD IN PHOENIX. Period.",

My family and I ordered tacos, flautas (might be better recognized as taquitos), bean burritos, tostadas, and enchiladas. The tacos were ok. Flautas ok. Bean Burrito ok. Tortillas not too fresh. Enchiladas we're the worst of them all as they were just simply not good. They were very spicy (which is ok) but not tasty. The tacos and tostadas were topped with iceberg lettuce and shredded American cheese. Not very authentic at all. The shop staff were very nice. They do not accept credit/debit at all. I had to walk across the street to convenience store to get cash back. Overall, probably wouldn't go back.",

I drive past it every day on my way home from work before getting on the I-10. I was curious so I looked up the reviews and was surprised to see so many great reviews on a place that looks like that!  I ordered take-out over the phone before leaving work. When I arrived, it looked even more interesting up close and inside then from the street. Basically a shack, with a sort of closed in patio as the dining area. I would never want to dine there. Not much ambience and too many crack heads wandering around.  However, the service was great. The cashier was very friendly. I grabbed my food and drove 20 minutes home with the wonderful smell of the food torturing me the whole way home.  Husband had the steak plate, I had the cheese enchilada plate. Everything was so good!! You ever get the feeling when food takes you back to happy memories? My late uncle had an amazing Mexican restaurant in Santa Ana, California. This food reminded me of his. The enchilada sauce was delectable, beans and rice perfectly cooked. Husband liked his steak as well. It was authentic without being greasy and sloppy like all those -berto places. You can tell the food is cooked with love and care.   It takes a lot for a Mexican food restaurant to be put on my heavy rotation list with all the excellent Mexican food Phoenix has to offer. El Norteno is definitely on that list!",

    "text": "Love me some tacos at El Norteno!  Shredded beef all the way...wife likes 'em with the machaca.  Pour some salsa on after each bite and I'm in heaven.  Thank goodness they only take cash (for my sake), otherwise I would have been eating there way more often than I already do.  Definitely a whole in the wall, but the cashier is always friendly and helpful.  Food is always fresh and it's only occasionally you'll have to deal with a tweaker or two walking over from the Circle K across the street.    My favorite place to get tacos in the valley.",

What Norteno is not: An expensive boutique $5 per taco/ fifteen-artisanal-salsas-made-daily kind of joint. If you want pricey hipster bullshit, STFU, get out of the line and drive your uppity ass to Taco Guild. This is not that place.",

    "text": "I had been staying downtown for a few weeks while my kitchen was being remodeled. I drove by this place twice a day and was drawn to it but didn't stop in because I assumed it was one of those places that use cilantro in everything (I'm one of the most anti-cilantro people ever). I finally went in and asked, what doesn't have cilantro? The lovely young lady looked at me like I was crazy and said, ummmm we don't really use that, I think it's in the carne asada tacos. So I got the fundido and the bf got the carne asada quesadilla. Both were incredible. The chips and salsa were fresh and it was a huge portion. Best salsa I have had in a loooooong time. I will be back. 5 stars on Yelp and a 4/5 on the Cilantrometer because cilantro was there, but in minimal use. Only way to get 5/5 is to not have it in house at all. Gracias El Norteno!!",

    "text": "What they lack in seating and credit card acceptance they make up for in flavors and textures.  Thursdays are Chile rellno special days, for $5.45 you get a chillie rellno, beans, rice, tortilla  and a small drink. A real steal but the value goes way up when you try the food as the flavors are great, rich thick red sauce, a firm texture to the rellno and rice that goes very well with their hot sauce.  Note in summer it may not be great as there is ONLY outdoor seating and waiting, and they are Cash only.",

What we ordered:  Shredded Beef Tacos Bean and Cheese Burro  I think tortillas were stale because they were broken on the tacos and the beans burst through the bottom of the burrito on the first bite and it wasn't grilled (or if it was it was barely cooked).  They do not have a salsa verde option, but their red salsa is good and isn't watered down.  Otherwise the flavor of the beans was nice.  Typical corner taco shop but the lady working there was super sweet. It was later in the evening, around 6:30pm.  Not impressed, but not the worst.",
