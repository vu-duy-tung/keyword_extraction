The dressings are prepared on premesise and a complement to the salad or wrap or rice dish. The menu of panini, wraps, rice dishes salads provide enough variety to eat there regularly(yes.. We do!) and not get bored. Prices are reasonable and service is friendly and helpful. Highly recommend it if you are in the neighborhood of 24th street/Baseline. P.s. love The Farm panini.",

To my surprise, there really wasn't a lot of tasty options to choose from until I stumbled upon this little gem on Yelp.  I ordered the C Square sandwich while my girlfriend got The Farm.  It was nice to see that our sandwiches both came with a side salad as well.  Both of us were in awe after taking our first bites of our sandwiches.  They were that good!  Not only that, but the side salad with the orange sesame vinaigrette dressing was superb.  We savored every bite until our plates were bone dry.  The owner, who was super friendly, even came over to chat with us and tell us about his amibtions of expanding.  Should I ever visit again, I will definitely be back here to get my fix.",

My only suggestion would be to have more veggie options for the build it yourself salad, like cucumbers, carrots, mushrooms, etc.",

I had The Pescado , which is their seared albacore panini and it had some whooping flavour for only $7.99.

They are really stingy with the portion sizes. I had to ask if the drink cup I received with my \"special\" was a water cup, it was that ridiculously small. The food is healthy but not at all flavorful.   Note: THEY DO NOT HAVE PANINIS even though it says that on the menu, which was disappointing since that's what I wanted. I don't think the owners know what a panini is honestly. You get a toasted sandwich.   I had the Green Chicken panini, which wasn't a panini at all, just a tiny toasted sandwich. It was really bland. They need to throw a little salt and some red onion on it. Something. My husband had the chicken salad wrap, which was a little tastier, but not much.  If they would season the food, up the portion sizes, switch to normal sized drink cups so I'm not insulted when they hand it to me, OR lower the prices, I would probably give it a second chance. Since my husband no longer works in the area and I wouldn't go out of my way to eat here, I probably won't be back.",

I love healthy food to begin with, but this place takes a tastier spin on your usual sandwichwes, salads and wraps!  Did I tell you about their salad?  The dressing is to die for!  Only drawback is that it does take a while to receive your food.  I suggest calling beforehand.  It does get crowded during lunch time and when it is not, they are short staffed.  They give Military discounts and incentives w/a punch card.  Definitely not bad for those looking for a different & healthier alternative.  :)",

Seriously, y'all if food poisoning or the stomach flu is what you want, by all means check this place out. Not to mention... $13 for a salad? Especially in such an unsanitary place, not worth it!",

Each time I had a salad, and they were both fresh and yummy.  Many of the dishes have an Asian influence and it's cool to see a place with a variety of tasty dishes instead of the usual humdrum lunch spots like Chipotle and Subway.  They are slightly more expensive than a typical lunch spot, but they still appear to have a loyal fan base of office workers in the area. I will definitely return the next time I'm in the area.",

Their salads are really yummy, too, but just not substantial enough for me. However, they have been enough for my coworkers, so maybe I just have a huge appetite. I also had this chicken greek wrap as a lunch special and it had so much flavor! It's a great place for lunch and the man, who I believe is the owner, is always very friendly!",

You can pick from their signature items that include salads, rice bowls, and paninis. Or... You can customize your own salad by choosing your greens, toppings, and dressing! I've tried many items on their menu and I have yet to dislike anything. The dressings have a lot of flavor, from sweet to savory and everything in between. By far, my favorite item is the greenmix tuna panini! To die for... You can have the tuna well done or seared. I like seared. It has Gouda cheese, fresh jalapenos (for that extra crunch), cilantro, onions, greens, and their house dressing! Perfection!! Great place for lunch or dinner!",

I got the Asian beef salad which included spring mix, jicama, tomatoes, carrots, oranges, cilantro, panko bread crumbs and spicy ponzu vinaigrette.  The vinaigrette is delicious!  You get plenty too so you can drown the salad with the sauce if you'd like.  Surprisingly, the flavors all worked and it was quite tasty.  I would definitely get the salad again.  The price was the only thing that caught me off guard.  It was a bit expensive for the salad.",

I was the only customer the entire time.  That was a bit strange but from now on, I'll trust the rule of, if your the only one there is a reason for it and leave.  So, I walked in, and held the menu for 4 minutes real time.  The guy at the counter simply looked at me silently.  Can I say \"AWKWARD!\"  I had no idea if it was an Asian inspired or Mediterranean type of menu.  How the heck does this place work?  I wanted a fatoosh salad but no luck so I played it safe and got a Greek salad with chicken.  I wish it would have come with some kind of bread to break up the salad texture.  To make a long story short:  Cons:  The food was a bit plain.  I could make it for $4 from frys but who wants to cook?  Not me.  It cost almost $10 for the salad alone, to go.   Small portions.  No help or customer service from the guy at the counter.  I think he wanted to continue watching his laptop.  I have to say he was polite while I ordered a basic salad with a dumb look on my face.  Hey it was a long work day.  Pros:  The woman who was cleaning and cooking was very polite and had a spark of personality.  Too bad she appeared to be doing all the work.  The store was amazingly clean, including the kitchen.  The reason for the two stars instead of one.  I love to see clean restaurants.",

They include the perfect combination of toppings like corn, pico de gallo, black beans, and cucumbers. I recently tried their grilled chicken panini and that was WOW!

I am vegan & hate places that only offer one standard veggie option.   I liked that they had a variety of greens, nuts, fruits, etc.  The spinach wrap itself was delicious & fresh!  CONS: The price listed on the build your own wrap is kind of a scam- all proteins are extra.  No tofu, bean or other good vegan protein option.  The huge paper menus that you mark your choices on seem like a waste of paper. That's a lot of garbage being generated. Plus the food for dine in is served on paper plates. More garbage created.  OVERALL:  The wrap was good, not great & a little pricey. I would not seek out this place but if was in the area & needed lunch i might go back.",

    "text": "The sign for Mixed Greens has been up for a few weeks and I have been eagerly anticipating the first time that I could go. Right now it is in a \"soft opening\" period where I guess they figure out what people in south phoenix like in a salad. For today I chose to get the Mango shrimp salad. It had a number of ingredients that I am a huge fan of. It had things like mango (duh) avocado, grilled shrimp (that I think they made right then) and Parmesan cheese. I am really enjoyed my salad. The dressing was tasty (I am not good at describing flavors) and a bit spicy and I ate the whole thing! It is of course brand new and so the help was incredibly friendly. They came around a few times checking to make sure that we enjoyed the food and that everything was too our liking. My wife ordered a rice bowl and it was a bit light on the sauce so he quickly brought out more! The tables were clean and it was a very open environment.   Here is the reality of this restaurant as I see it. In south phoenix we all complain a bit about the lack of choices as far as food is concerned. There are plenty of fried foods and Mexican places but nothing much after that. If you want variety and choice, supporting this place would be a great start. The food is good and the service is great. You can tell that they want to be successful by the efforts they make. If you like salad with unique flavors and awesome meats (like seared tuna, and steak) then you will probably like this place. If you don't eat here than I hope you eat dirt.",

Now for an update. If I could give 4 1/2 stars I would. They have gone back to the way things were when they first opened. Better portions, fresh food & a very clean restaurant. It always makes me happy when I see restaurants take comments from Yelp and fix any problems there might be and it looks like Green Mix has done just that. Good job Green Mix you have gotten me back as a loyal customer.  A couple things I would like to see implemented. Maybe some better lunch deals, sandwich's are still a bit pricey for being next to Subway. The quality of your food blows Subway away but we are in a deep recession and a $5 foot long seems more appealing. The other thing and the BIGGEST complaint I have is NO KIDS menu. When I drive by at night the place is a ghost town and it might be because families will not come to Green Mix because of the lack of a kids menu. I know for our family, with 4 kids, you will never get our night or weekend business because there is NO KIDS menu. Why not have a grilled cheese or BLT that can be put on something other then a panini.  Other then that, good job getting the food portions and standards back to where they were when you first opened.",

I do wish they had a larger salad menu.

The greens, the chicken, the apples, the walnuts, the chickpeas, ...everything was fresh, not a tinge of brown or sogginess on anything.  Dressing on both salads was fairly light and not overpowering, which is great if you want to avoid the \"drowned in 1000 Islands\" thing.   It's pricey if you think of it as \"just salad\" but the fact that it's made fresh makes it worth it. You can also make up your own salad creation, add or omit ingredients, and so forth.

My boyfriend and I came here for 2 reasons. 1st: He has a gluten allergy and we knew we would be safe with a salad. 2nd: There was a big sign that read: $3.99 (& up) Specials Includes Fountain Drink. So, we figured it would be a cheap lunch. We were soooooo wrong. Upon ordering, I asked what the $3.99 special was, the lady said a chicken salad sandwich. Ok, great! And it includes a fountain drink (according to the advertisment)...WRONG. Fountain drinks are another $1.95. So there is no such thing as a $3.99 special that includes a fountain drink, FALSE ADVERTISING!!! I ordered the sandwich and drink and my bf ordered a build your own salad, which had lettuce, cucumber, and onions, nothing else and no dressing and a fountain drink. Total was $15.48!!!! We are assuming we will get a fair amount of food. WRONG AGAIN. My sandwich was mostly bread and didn't have any kind of side, not even a sprig of parsley for presentation, and his salad was a handful of lettuce with 4-5 slices of cucumbers and some dry onions, probably smaller than a side salad from Wendy's. Irritated already, i took 2 bites of a crappy chicken salad sandwich and low and behold a curly black hair in the middle of the chicken salad. The lady behind the counter had kinky black hair so I knew exactly where it came from, thank God! I took the sandwich back to her and she offered to make another, I told her I just wanted my money back, she gave me back the $4. So all in all we paid $11 and some change for a ridiculous excuse for a salad and 2 sodas. And still left hungry.  I will NEVER go back here, I cringe just thinking about it. And I am pretty easy on restaurants, being that I was a server for 8 years, but this place is aweful.   STAY AWAY!!!!!!!!!!",

When I complained, the manager said I was wrong, it was a good salad, and I didn't know what fresh food tastes like. She then took my plate and didn't offer a replacement. I just wasted $10 and didn't get to eat.   While the food is sub-par, the management is what prompted this review.",

Everyone is so nice but they need more help. Sometimes the ones taking the orders cook as well making people who walk in wait and I saw people walk out after waiting so long.  Foods delicious!!! The lunch special with the beef is outstanding and the green chicken panini is a must.",

However, the salad was delicious, and the dressing was slightly sweet, slightly spicy, and very good.  My only complaint is that the order counter is cluttered, almost made me leave. At the counter you can see the kitchen and it doesn't look 'dirty' but it looks very cluttered which I tend to think is dirty. Maybe if the counters were less cluttered, and the view to the kitchen was covered I would have hd a better first impression.",

Everything else is a bunch of nasty fast food chain spots.   My fave is the Fiesta Shrimp Panini, which was recommended by one of the owners when I first ate here. I'm totally hooked. The combo of grilled shrimp, romaine, tomato, jalapeno, cilantro and their creamy chipotle dressing is phenomenal.",

I can't remember what was supposed to be on it, but there's chicken, corn cherry tomatoes, soggy cheese, a little avocado  and a bunch of caesar type lettuce.  The chicken was fine, but the rest of the salad was completely unmemorable.  I ate the whole thing because I was starving and i'm still hungry.  I wouldn't normally care, I'd just never go back, but this was a pretty expensive salad for a to-go place, almost $13.  I saw some wraps going out & they looked huge, so maybe those are better.  Don't go for the salad.",

I mean more then most places that range at $10... this places starts at $15.00... super high and a once and a blue moon type place ... the other is... the last time I went into the place to order ... I was standing at the counter awaiting my to go order and what do I spy from my left eye ... a roach running over the partition where the food is prepped and the bagged ... whattt!!!!.... I immediately started searching for the rating notice in the window ... it wasn't just any-t roach it was one that is bread from dirt ... not the run of the meal kinds we see in the yard but like a house roach..... bien ... me thinks this was my last time coming ...

The brown rice had too much water in it. It was very mushy which was a waste because I didn't even bother eating it after. Korean bbq was cooked medium well which is how I like it. It was tasty and delish. Salad was great, veggies were fresh and it came with a salad dressing which tasted like the in and out sauce. Very yummy. My bf salad was good also and his steak was also cooked medium well. Everything we ordered was great besides the rice I wish they would have cooked it better. It's okay though the service was awesome. Overall this place wasnt too bad knowing its in the southside phoenix area..",

    "text": "My husband and I came here from PHX airport looking for a healthier lunch option in the area...you know when you just really want a sandwich or a salad instead of burgers and fries? We chose GreenMix because it wasn't a far drive and we could get our meal to go.   There was nobody in the eatery. Sure it was the Saturday before Mother's Day at 11:45 am, but I was surprised to not see any other customers. Oh well, it gave us the opportunity to get a personal welcome by a nice Asian lady who showed us what the menu had to offer. She even asked where we were from and was overall friendly and motherly!  As for the environment, the tables and chairs were very clean (in fact, the lady that greeted us was wiping down the windows when we came in). There's no grimy feel about this place.   On another note, there was just one girl working in the back making our order. I imagine if you come on a busier day you might have to wait awhile for your food. It took ours about 8-10 minutes with no one else coming in while we were here.   What we ordered: -Green Chicken Sandwich ($7.95): contains grilled chicken, spinach, avocado, green apple, smoked Gouda, and chipotle dressing - also comes with side salad -Honey Walnut Chicken salad ($9.95): has grilled chicken, green apple, walnuts, feta, & chickpeas on a bed of spinach with honey walnut vinaigrette  Listen to what everyone has said and go with the Green Chicken sandwich!! Soft bread, great textures with the apples inside, juicy chicken, and just a little too much creamy chipotle dressing. The salad was good, fresh ingredients, and again, juicy chicken with little pops of flavor from the walnuts!  I like what they've done in creating new flavor combos and yet there's also an option for create-your-own sandwich or salad. I'd recommend this place for fresh sandwiches and salads with a tasty twist. Skip Subway (which happens to be right next store) and find a new sandwich to fall in love with (I'm going to try to recreate this at home in NorCal!).",

    "text": "I'm a salad lover. Recently when I was headed to an area of town I'm almost never in, I checked for something new and was pleasantly surprised to see one I'd never seen before - GreenMix! Sweet!   What the pleasant girl at the register said to me was: \"Hi! How are you doing? What can I get for you?\"  What I wish she had said was: \"Hi! Hey, before you order, I want to make sure you understand that it might take us upwards of an hour to make your two salads, and the minute you hand your cash over to me, you won't be able to get a refund - even if we haven't started to THINK about making your salads - you're going to be totally screwed and we're going to take your money - so like, is that cool?\"  Because my answer would have been no that's not cool, that's stupid, what the hell is wrong with you.   But that didn't happen.   Instead, I ordered my salads and she brightly said \"we'll have that out to you as quickly as possible!\" I then went and sat in the waiting area. For thirty minutes. For two salads (that didn't come). Not only did they not come, they had not even been started yet (the people who had been in front of me in line were also still foodless and confused), and I was out of time. So I returned to register girl and I tell her that I have to go. I do this in a tone of voice that attempts to convey to her that I'm deeply disappointed I couldn't get a salad made in under an hour - but she looks at me blankly as if I had just spoken a secret moon language. She throws up her hands as if to ask \"well what do you want me to do?\"  Really? You have no idea what I might want? I paid $25 for two salads that you haven't yet started making, yet you're just left with NO IDEA? What could it be? WHAT COULD IT BE  \"I want you to give me my money back.\"  GASP  For a moment, she recoils in horror... but she recovers almost instantly.   \"Oh, I can't give you a refund,\" she says.  No hint of her earlier hesitation and frustration. This girl knows one thing in all the world and it is this: she can NOT give me a refund.  \"I can give you store credit.\"  My jaw dropped. You haven't even started to make my salads, I've cost you absolutely nothing (and you've cost me basically my whole lunch hour) - but you can't give me my money back?  I gamely attempt to explain that store credit is useless when you'd rather gnaw off your own leg than come back, but as you might imagine, this gets me nowhere. My wallet $25 lighter, I left the restaurant hungry, never to return. Buyer beware. The way I see it these people straight up stole $25 from me.   PS: IT'S A SALAD PEOPLE WHAT THE HELL",

I came in with my party, ordered and was promptly delivered an array of awesome custom salads.   Everyone was thoroughly impressed with the selection and fresh taste of the salads.   Our server happen to mention that they have refinished their tables and pointed out to me that they weren't sticky, he was very proud,  and he should be.  Tables are great and no longer have a sticky touch to them.  He didn't mention seeing the review but that was the only thing I could really give a \"con\" remark to on my original Yelp review at GreenMix.    Outstanding! Here is a business that pays attention to their reviews and makes the necessary changes for their customers.  Thank you... see you soon.",

While waiting for my order, I sat and watched several other orders being prepared. To my disdain, I noticed the cook had dropped a piece of steak on the floor; however, while in the motion of picking it up she noticed me watching and instead left it there.  I swear it looked as if she were going to throw it back on the grill! Secondly, while exiting the restaurant, I stopped to fill my cup of water with a few lemons and saw a cockroach-- yes cockroach-- crawling out of the lemons!!!!! I didn't cause a scene although, I felt like fainting, and instead brought it to the attention of the lady that's generally there when I go in.  I understand \"things happen\" but I just can't seem to go back.  I've always enjoyed the salads and never really had any other complaints.  ***This experience took place nearly one year ago***",

As I walked in, I experience a bit of menu anxiety since it was my first visit and I wasn't sure what to expect. However, the staff was friendly and once they learned I was a first timer, the guy walked me through the steps. I decided to go with a salad, so I first choice the type of greens, followed by four additions from the bowls filled with veggies and cheese. This salad would be $5.99. They also had other bowls full of avocado, eggs, etc. However, those were 75 cents extra per topping. I'm a sucker for avocado so I decided it was work the three quarters. I also ended up adding chicken which was another $2. I ended up walking away with a hefty salad and soda for under $10. It's not cheap, but worth it for a fresh salad topped with added items! I will definitely visit again and keep my finger's crossed that they will open up more locations in the Valley.",

I have eaten here over a dozen times. I agree with previous reviews that it is overpriced, but I have let that go as it is locally owned and fresh produce can add up.   HOWEVER, twice a single staff member has spilled on me when cleaning up. The first time she spilled salad dressing on my lap and did not seem to realize it. She gave me a strange look when I asked for another napkin. Once she realized it she did apologize. The second time she spilled someone else's ice on my feet and purse. I got a muttered apology with no eye contact. I waited a few minutes to see if someone would do something to try to keep my business. I am a  regular and it was the second spill. No one approached me so I left.   I do believe that the young woman is a nice person. She seemed embarrassed, but the staff have poor customer service skills.  Also, I believe that they substitute greens without informing the customer. Once I ordered romaine and believe I got iceberg. Same thing when I ordered butter lettuce. If you want real greens ask for spinach or the mixed greens.  I admire the effort to open a healthy restaurant in South Phoenix. I wish this place was managed better...",

Heated it in the micro for 30 seconds and it really brought all the flavors out better than eating the other half on the first day did.  I'd skip the rice bowls though.  Nothing wowed us about that dish.    Lucky for me they are in my neighborhood, so I'll give them another visit soon.",

Its a little more out of the pocket than the normal lunch but for what you get, i think its worth it.",

When you walk in, the restaurant has a very comfortable feel.  Reviewing the menu, the entire menu reveals food that is incredibly heathy not to mention tasty.  This family owned restaurant makes you feel welcome as soon as you walk it.  I don't know about the majority of people around town, but I, for one, love to support local business in lieu of corporate chains.  What can I tell you, beside being very comfortable and friendly, the food is INCREDIBLE!!!  I had the Thai Shrimp salad which was an incredible experience of flavor.  Would I return here to eat again???  You bet I would!  In a heart beat!  Thank you for an incredible first experience!  :)",

THe reason I am writing this review is for the Farm hot pressed panini.  FIrst off it's not technically a panini more like hot toasted sandwich.  I had never had a squash sandwich before, but it was really good.  The break was toasty and fresh and the vegetables were cooked perfectly.  If you are near this place for lunch stop in and have one.  The price is a bit on the high side for a sandwich shop, but it was really good.  Try:  - The Farm Sandwich",

Stop in and take a break be glad you did. The price is a bit more than you might pay for much lower quality food -- deal with it. They have excellent healthy ingredients. Plus it is a very nicely laid out and designed restaurant, a comfortable place to relax. Plus you can get free wifi from the box store nearby, what more do you want in a daily restaurant.   The specials are great. That's all I get, because I have trouble deciding on anything else.

He had me get the Happy Veggie and added Panko to that. Then when he brought it out he brought me both the dressing for the Happy Veggie and the Asian Chicken. So nice!  My Happy Veggie was super tasty. They put seasonal veggies on there and they were great. I loved both dressings but the Asian Chicken salad one was my favorite.

However, I do agree with some of the other reviews that for the price, the portions seems small and they are indeed stingy with the toppings.     I went with a friend and I ordered the Chicken Cobb Salad for $8.49.   It's served with a full chicken breast, but I had to search for the bacon, blue cheese, and the slivers (I'm not kidding when I say \"slivers\") of egg.     They have a wide selection of dressings, which if it's not the busy  the owner will let you try.   The Honey Walnut Vinaigrette is bland, but the Spicy Ponzu Vinaigrette is wonderful (an asian-inpsired sweet sesame), and I enjoyed the Herb Balsamic Vinaigrette (which I subbed on my salad for the Lemon Ranch Herb dressing).  As a side note, but my husband was thrilled to see they served coke in a glass bottle!  I hope the owners read these reviews and try to modify their approach to be a little more generous with their toppings.    Still, I'm thrilled to have a healthy alternative like Salads to our area in South Phoenix!!!",

The first time I had the Thai shrimp salad, and the second time I had the Korean Beef BBQ wrap (it's listed as a sandwich, but you can get any salad or sandwich as a wrap instead, which is a nice touch).  The Korean BBQ wrap was REALLY delicious!  However, I would have preferred the red onions to have been cut into thinner slices -- I'm not a fan of chunks of red onion.  So I just picked some of them out and continued to enjoy my wrap.    However, I have to agree with other reviewers that the portion sizes do not match the prices.  $10 for a wrap is a bit on the high side, especially for a fast food alternative.  With Subway next door selling $5 footlongs, they might want to consider lowering their prices if they're trying to attract the fast food crowd.",
