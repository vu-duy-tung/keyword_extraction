The serving was a good sized portion and it was full of moist and tasty brisket.  I like this place and will definitely be back from time to time.",

Since we live closer to this one, we decided to go here since we were randomly craving some bbq and didn't realize this location was just hiding in the shopping center for a year! The restaurant is soooo beautiful. I am obsessed with all the brick work, so if anything just come here for how pretty and cozy it is. Everyone was so friendly, multiple people greeted us as well as welcomed us to come back when we were leaving. Even the manager (I think) was stopping at every table to see how everything was. The booths were comfy and also nicer looking. The restaurant is also open until 2am!   The food was pretty much on point as the other location. The only downside is that the menu is limited and we were so sad when we were told they don't have gravy. Who sells mashed potatoes without gravy?! I think they should if anything just make gravy so people can order it on the side. We were bummed as we then did not get the mashed potatoes. The Mac and cheese was great, but very very cheesy. The market salad was good, had squash, goat cheese and pomegranate seeds (not bbq but really good), the broccolini was also cooked perfect (it was the veggie of the day). We also had the pulled pork sandwich which again, was tasty. The sauce was a mixture of spicy and tangy. We also are a big fan of the cornbread they serve and don't forget to get your warm bag of donuts on the way out (you'll regret it in a good way).",

Everything from the atmosphere (absolutely beautiful interior) to the drinks (try the Princess Peach) is top notch. I feel I have the credentials to judge BBQ as a Missouri girl and former vegetarian, and their meat is out of this world. True fall-off-the-bone, slow cooked, made with love smoked meat. Oh, and the sides are all so damn yummy you can never order just one without serious FOMO. I highly suggest coming here with several people so you can order your top choice side dish and then convince a friend to order something else, like say your second choice side, so you can secretly have a few bites of theirs too.",

It says it could feed one or two but honestly it could easily feed 4. The meat was fall off the bone and smoked to perfection. I've eaten a lot of BBQ but am by no means an expert. I do think this is more consistent with what you would expect from a sweeter Kansas style or St. Louis BBQ with a liberal amount of moisture and sauce. The huge beef ribs are not a dry bbq, but are also generously sauced. All the sides were great. We had the should string friends (addictive!), mac and cheese, roasted corn, broccolini, and cole slaw. All were solid and delicious. We also had a kale salad and the q rolls not realizing how the portions were. Both were also excellent. The food came out quickly and service was friendly.

This isn't just fall off the bone ribs it's you pick up the rib and the meat stays in place and the bone just slides out ribs, perfection . Let's not forget the cornbread that was perfectly moist and sweet. The atmosphere was pretty amazing too, great decor!  Not to mention the little churro like doughnuts that are SOOO good.

I wanted Bobby Q for no reason other than I had not had one of their excellent burgers in a long time. The one person from the East valley didn't want to make the drive to the original one and the rest of didn't want to drive to the one on Stapley. So we chose this one in spite of the fact it is hard to tell on line if the menu and pricing is the same as the other 2 locations, they are. Be prepared to notice how small this location is in comparison. We got there just as they opened and they were just about full up when we left. They do have a patio with misters  that is shaded on the West from the afternoon sun. Lunch time in July I am sure it only sees use as a last resort.  And yes, I did get a burger and mac and cheese which were just as good as I remembered from the original location. The service was also good.",

Bobby Q (Biltmore) is tucked away in the shopping center and  the atmosphere at Bobby Q's is great, and like there counter part the food is always exceptional.    On this visit we ordered the BBQ pork, BBQ chicken, BBQ beef brisket sandwiches and coleslaw.  I have to admit I have never been a fan of coleslaw but the coleslaw at Bobby Q is to die for and the meats, lean, flavorfull, and tender.  The service at Bobby Q is always exceptional. Our server checked in on us often but wasn't intrusive. They made sure we had everything we wanted and that our meal was enjoyable.  If you're ever in the neighborhood give him a try you won't be disappointed.",

The staff was friendly and they always made sure we had everything we needed. There were 5 adults in my group and we decided to go for the Whole hog heaven: you get to pick 2 ribs, 2 other meats and 3 sides. We went for the baby back and beef ribs, brisket, chicken and baked potato, broccolini and fries for our sides.  Overall the food was pretty good. We were all hungry and there was definitely enough meat for everyone.  I especially liked the fall of the bone baby back ribs and the smokey brisket. Chicken was pretty good tho it could have used a tad bit less sauce.  The only \"downside\" I guess would be that the side dishes were pretty small in size even if we had 3 for 5 people. The broccolini were so yummy but there wasn't enough for everyone.  Good choice for bbq cravings!",

The brisket was dry, and needed a lot of sauce to make it enjoyable but their house BBQ sauce was really good! My work peers really enjoyed the ribs and pulled pork. I tried the ribs and agreed. The Mac and Cheese was creamy but I have had better. I will give them another try when I return next month.",

Visited the place today with my husband and two kids- infant and a toddler.  Meat did fall off the bone. Salad was innovative and interesting  Kids were busy and quiet in the beginning. Then they had a moment of crying. It did last a few minutes.  Immediately, An employee approached our table and asked us in a very respectful way if there is anything she could do to help us with the kids.  She said she was concerned about the rest of the customers...  Very interesting approach.  An hour earlier our kids laughed and cried at the lobby of the Phoenician hotel for an hour. Employees and guests stopped by with joy to say hello to our kids.  It does not seem right...., right?  Kids will be kids. One minute they cry and one minute they laugh.   At Bobbi-Q instead of focusing on the customers that complain, they will focus on your baby's crying...  One thing for sure - while families with kids customers may not be the future of Bobby-B, kids are the future of every nation, including ours....",

One thing to note before going is the spare ribs, which True BBQ aficionados prefer to baby backs, are fattier and therefore more flavorful, at the Phoenix location are not on the menu here. We had pulled pork, brisket and baby backs. The BBQ sauce did not appeal to my palette nor did the dry rub. I would ask not to sauce the meat before serving. The pecan coleslaw was a welcome novelty. The baked beans were again just adequate. The free donuts were delicious and our waiter gave us a free bread pudding to take home for my companion's birthday, thanks Devin.  Taste, especially in food and doubly so about BBQ is subjective so I thought I would add my companion's comment. She said the pulled pork, really smoky, was the best she has had since coming to Phoenix over 18 years ago.",

I had BBQ platter to try 3 types of meat...it was fantastic as well. The macaroni and cheese was okay (I love a good Mac & Cheese) bit the sauce tasted a bit processed...not bad- but not memorable either. I had a delicious cocktail as well!

    "text": "Woah baby this is good BBQ! I have to admit that I am not a big fan of bbq, I have to be in the right mood...but Bobby Q is delicious!   We heard from a friend about this new spot and decided to try it while the family was in town for the holidays. We ordered for pick up and it was all ready to go at the time we asked for (for some reason this can be challenging for some places). We ordered brisket, half chicken, hot links, buns, coleslaw, and mashed potatoes. When we got it home we realized there was only one small cup of sauce for all of us, but we didn't even need it. The meats were so good and flavorful that any extra sauce would have taken away from it. Everything was cooked to perfection with just the right amount of fat that melted in your mouth with each bite. The hot links were more mild than hot, and the mashed potatoes were good but nothing to write home about. Everything else however was stellar. The coleslaw and brisket were quite possibly the best I've ever had. The buns were not necessary either, the meat spoke for itself. Clearly Bobby Q is doing it right! I'm anxious to try some of their other delicacies sometime soon. Even though I'm not a big bbq fan you can be sure I'll be a regular at this place. I highly recommend checking it out for yourself.",

Then . .  this past Sunday night we did a repeat and they were horrible, so I guess it's hit and miss.   One third  of the ribs was a mass of congealed meat and most of the ribs were full of fat!  I picked the meat off the bones, discarded the fat and tendons, and put it in a salad the next day.   We agreed we need a different agenda on Sunday nights, too dicey to order these ribs again;  so disappointing.      The cornbread is great, as is the coleslaw with pecans on top.   The shoestring potatoes were okay, and we tried the potato salad, but we really just like a big salad and the ribs.   Too bad, because we were at Mexx 32 all the time and loved it, and miss that place, especially because we could take our (well-behaved)  dog on the patio.    The bar looks like a 'happening' place, but the ribs were a downer this last time.   Need better quality control.",

    "text": "Okay so Bobby Q really deserves 3.5 stars food wise, but I will round it up to 4 because of the overall experience. As suggested by most reviews we started our meal with the q rolls. My oh my, everyone is right because they were phenomenal! Tender, juicy brisket wrapped into a crunchy roll. An awesome American twist to the traditional spring roll. There was 3 adults and 2 children in our party so we decided to order the whole hog consisting of: beef ribs, pork ribs and brisket. The meat was overall good, but maybe a little bit too tender for my liking. Obviously they have to cook this ahead of time, but I could tell it did not come directly off the grill/smoker. We did really enjoy the variety of sauces they offer especially the \"Q-a-lina.\" If you are in a party of 4, the whole hog option is way to go. Service was prompt and friendly. Classy interior with a beautiful entrance filled with plants along the bar area. I also love the fact they have complimentary corn bread to start and donuts to end the meal. Not sure if I'll be back, but the least I can do is write them a good review. If I come back, it'll definitely be for the q rolls!",

Our server was kind and attentive (didn't catch his name but we were a table of 5 at around 5pm today in a booth by the bar). He was training another employee.

Someone clearly screwed up, because we ended up with cornbread, which wasn't even part of the order. They made me call GrubHub. GrubHub called the driver and the restaurant. After they got back in touch with me, they told me that the restaurant had refused to issue a refund. I paid $44 for two cold sandwiches with no sides and a garden salad and three pieces of cornbread I didn't ask for that showed up 10 minutes outside of the delivery window. I will never order from Bobby Q again. And I have serious reservations about using GrubHub in the future.",

If you're a fan of cheesy Mac & Cheese that is balanced with the pasta, you must try it here. Sunday is a great family night to come Family Feast special is dollar for dollar worth it. The only thing missing is Shiner Bock to go with the fall off the bones ribs. If your a BBQ fan you know what I am talking about! Enjoy! Cheers!",

We sat in the first booth beyond the bar and it was the best seat in the house. Our server, Christa, was right on top of things and had a great personality to go with her excellent service!  My husband asked about the coleslaw and she offered to bring him a sample which was a great idea. We all had barbecue and it was fantastic. You can't go wrong with a fun night at BobbyQ's.",

    "text": "We found this place on Google (we were travelling from Ohio) and with such positive reviews, we couldn't resist.   We didn't realize until we got there that there's three locations and the Phoenix and Mesa locations share a menu while the Biltmore location on Camelback has another menu. It was fine but there were a couple things on the menu that we were looking forward to but they didn't have. However, none of that mattered because the food was crazy good!  It took 10 minutes for someone to greet us once we were seated, and once the manager, Joanna, asked if we had been waited on, she apologized profusely, got someone to help us right away and offered to comp a starter and dessert. She also apologized later and said that their goal is to greet within two minutes and it was unacceptable. The way they made it right (by the way, it wasn't a big deal because the ambiance and awesome breeze on the patio had us feeling so comfortable) along with the food and service so made up for any wrongdoing! I will definitely be coming back!  We started with the Q Rolls and they were okay, the brisket was a bit tough for my liking but my friend loved them. I then got the Babyback Half Rack with macaroni and cheese and pecan cole slaw. The ribs fell off the bone and was so tender, the sauce was perfect, sweet and tangy. The mac and cheese was divine and the server, Aimee, said it was really good, but being a mac and cheese snob made me skeptical. She was telling the truth! It was creamy and simple, just as it should be to complement everything else. The cole slaw was good - cream based, which is my preference. They just put a few chopped pecans on top so I don't know if I would've called it \"pecan cole slaw,\" but it was good nonetheless. The cornbread was amazing as well!  We didn't take advantage of the free dessert because we were \"Thanksgiving full\" but that didn't stop us from trying their complimentary cocaine, I mean cinnamon, donuts because of the reviews. Hot and hypnotic!",

Q-rolls are amazing. I love brisket and the sauce they are served with is soo good. One order comes with 6 rolls so they're definitely shareable.   On  another visit, we came for the late night menu and had brisket tacos. Amazing. I don't think you could order anything bad from the place. The ribs are good, the brisket is good, Mac and cheese is amazing.   We were even given cornbread before our meal and freshly made donuts for dessert!!   Definitely come hungry because the portions are huuuuge. I never thought BBQ could be classed up but Bobby Q's did it. The environment at the restaurant is nice and the patio is great at night.   Definitely recommend for cocktails, food, and as a date night spot!",

There was so much fat, and so much bone, that finding the meat was a chore. Maybe the food at their original location is better, but, except for the delicious cornbread, I would not recommend this location.",

Let's start with the food, amazing ribs and brisket. The ribs literally fall off the bone and are so tender with such great flavor. The sauce is just the right amount of sweetness without being overwhelmingly spicy hot. We're outnumbered here in Arizona, we consider salt a spice and don't venture even to pepper much. Crazy, I know! I'm not a huge fan of cornbread but I would go back if they were out of everything and only had cornbread to serve. The serving sizes of everything ordered was generous.  The service was excellent both times we were there and we found the patio especially comfortable.  I thought I would never find great BBQ in Phoenix but I did and couldn't be happier.

I'm gluten free so I couldn't enjoy the complimentary corn bread or sugar donuts but the rest of the group really enjoyed them. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich (without a bun) and the thin fries. Both were delicious. I was excited they brought additional containers of BBQ sauce to the table, especially when one was spicy - but it was not spicy at all!! Even my husband who can't handle the heat agreed it was not spicy. It still tasted great though. It is a little higher end, but the quality makes it worth the price. I live quite far from this area but I will be back next time I make my way to Biltmore.",

Got a nice table right away, had very good service, and ordered some nice large cold beers - a special idk but were refreshing with bbq.  Got the Q rolls $12 to try - large order of 6 very good, filled with brisket, and complimentary corn bread and butter - yumm.  We ordered the Whole Hog Heaven  with ribs, brisket and pulled pork (coulda have tried sausage or chicken too) and extra bbq sauce on the side - plenty with leftovers for us 4 adults.  We got 3 sides - good pecan coleslaw, mac and cheese, and fries for dd.  Best ending was the complementary 8 donuts hot in a bag with sugar - easy to go if you ate too much bbq! total with 3 beers $92+tip.  Fun place and great food!",

I was greeted immediately by my server who suggested a wonderful cocktail -Peach something! I forgot the name. I ordered a ribeye and it was wonderful. The manager on duty also stopped by my table to say hello to me. The only reason why I won't give 5 stars is because I felt rushed. The server checked on me too many times and offered to box my food when I was cutting into my steak. I would just suggest reading your guests a little better. I know the server is there to make money and she needs to flip tables quickly in order for that to happen, but I have been checking out restaurants in the area since so many have opened.  I want to find a favorite to take friends and out of town guests to. This is definitely a great place, and I will return. Just wanted to make that suggestion.",

There isn't a ton of great BBQ in Phoenix, so I'm glad Bobby Q opened in my neighborhood. I ordered the baby back ribs, which were fall-off-the-bone delicious and my fiancee ordered the pulled pork sandwich, which was tender and dressed to perfection.  The sides are also great and BIG. Sharing is encouraged.   Cocktail menu is interesting. There are tons of unique drinks and each was photographed so you can basically point to the menu to order.  The donuts you get when you leave are also amazing. I didn't know what to think of the little to-go bag at first, but I couldn't stop eating them on the way home!",

The restaurant was very clean, but the floor in the back was so slippery, like maybe too much solution was in the water when they mopped it? I was wearing sneakers and my boyfriend was in flip flops and we were still slipping and sliding. I feel bad for anyone in heels! Overall though everything was great and we will definitely be back.",

Next, the PPS's (PULLED PORK SAMMY) we ordered came out hot, fresh, and ready. The meat was thicc but tender at the same time. I have never been so content with a PPS. Best in the valley. I tried some of Mary's mashed potatoes and I had an immediate verbal reaction: \"Flavor\". Then, to our surprise, Colton offered us even more cornbread. Of course, we accepted. AND THEN, Colton brought out the COMPLIMENTARY BAG of cinny sugar donuts (free of charge)! Colton was the best server in the west: treated us right, big smiles, and plenty of BBQ and fun. In conclusion, Mary and I thought that Bobby Q was so far the highlight of senior year.",

    "text": "This new location located in the Biltmore area is a little smaller than the Phoenix and Mesa/Gilbert locations but is very nice and of course the same famous barbecue. There was additional seating on the patio and of course at the bar. I also noticed some of the hostess, servers, and managers from the other two locations which was nice (if you have been to Bobby Q's before you know that the service is top of the line). Parking can get very busy here however they do have free valet parking in the back where there is a back door entrance to the restaurant. Though Bobby Q's are open 7 days a week... what I really love about this location is that it is open till 2:00am Tuesday through Saturday! So there is now great barbecue available centrally located to the valley after a late night out. I have been eating at Bobby Q for 10 years now and have eaten pretty much everything on the menu however there are a few items that are not on the menu at this location (do to it being a little smaller) that are on the original menu including 2 of my favorites being the steak sandwich and Bob's famous fish n chips but this is a barbecue restaurant and not really a deal breaker. I would say for first timers order the Q-Rolls for appetizer and the 2 or 3 meat combo that are big enough to share. My personal favorite side is the homemade Mac & cheese which is the best I have had anywhere. Oh and don't forget to grab the complimentary homemade donuts on your way out.",

Try the Q Rolls! A great appetizer! The sauces were a wonderful flavor.   Half rack of ribs was huge and it falls off the bone. So good. The sides I chose were the corn and beans. These were also delicious. The beans do have meat and were very good.   My husband had the filet - he loved it. And the small bite I had was wonderful.   We were too stuffed to have dessert, but never fear - mini donuts top off the experience and you'll have something for later along with your take out box. ...because you may over order like we did and have leftovers!

    "text": "Came in to Bobby Q for lunch on Fathers Day and was seated pretty quickly! Quality of the food was amazing, and their service was equally as awesome.   We started with the Q-Rolls--which is basically egg rolls but filled with bbq meat. They come with a chipotle aioli sauce and bbq sauce on the side (the aioli was awesome!). I ordered the Beef Brisket Burger and it was perfect. Juicy, tender, and full of flavor. The side of Mac and cheese was delicious and super cheesy. And to top it all off they gave us these cinnamon crusted donuts that were hot out of the oven (which also tasted great).   Our server Ann was super helpful and friendly. Didn't need to ask for a refill of a drink because she would bring one out for you before you even realized you were almost out. My dad asked to sample one of the sides before he ordered it and she gladly brought it to him.   Great service and a great restaurant. Def will need to come back and try out the bar next time!",

I'm also very aware of other people and bothering them, so I do step out if needed and don't let my toddler act crazy. I ended up leaving my 11 year old and his father there to eat dinner because i felt so uncomfortable with eyes on my toddler and I (Without reason besides the fact that she's a toddler). I've been going to Bobby Q's on 27th ave for years and I have never felt the way I felt at this location. 3 stars because I was able to drink my tea and it was good.",

I took my friends from for a great treat on baby back ribs but was extremely disappointed with the service we received yesterday.   1. The person who waited on us did not bother to serve the corn bread. We had to ask for it.   2. He did not ask us if we needed any refills on our drinks. Nor did he bother to refill my water!   3. He cleared the appetizer plate which had the dips on them when clearly I wasn't finished with the Qrolls that were on my plate.  4. We didn't want to fill up on too much food since we had plans of bar hopping that night so we thought of sharing the entree. As a result we did not get any bigger size plates for doing so. We had to eat out of the small plates. Though he did provide us with fresh flat but very small plates!  5. We were really looking forward to the house made cinnamon donuts that they give with the check. But as usual we didn't get those and had to ask for them. And he carefully placed 4 donuts just because we were a party of four! Well, I have had got more when there were only 2 of us!!  Anyway, the food as usual was very good. The ribs were literally fall of the bone! Yum!   Really sad to have received such a treatment in one of my favorite restaurants!",

From the moment you walk in the door you are greeted by the smell of the wood fired grill and smoked meats. The atmosphere is very cool, intimate, and hip with rustic Arizona flair. Our waiter, Colton, was wonderful and helpful. Now for the best part: the food. We ordered the half rack of baby back ribs and the rotisserie chicken. Both were extremely juicy, tender and seasoned to perfection! We got to choose two sides each so we went with the Brussels sprouts, cole slaw, mashed potatoes, and potato salad. We both agreed the sides were so delicious we would return just for those! Would recommend this restaurant to anybody!!",

They did not have their typical shoestring fries, but he said the fries were crispy and good. (He does prefer their shoestrings.)  My other son ordered wings, and the plate came with three different sauces and carrot and celery sticks. He said the wings were perfectly seasoned and he loved having all the different sauces.  I ordered the filet cooked medium, and it was extremely tender, caramelized on both sides, and pink in the middle.  I also had a side of grilled corn and a baked potato.  The potato skin was a bit crispy, but not overly baked, just the way I like it.  I hate it when restaurants foil cook their potatoes and the skin comes out soft.  BobbyQ's does it right!   The Biltmore location is the smallest of the three BobbyQ's and has a smaller menu, but the quality of the food is just as great.  There is additional parking in the back and you can come in through the back entrance. The restaurant was full, and quite noisy (it was 6:00), but I expected that. Thanks BobbyQ's Biltmore!",

Actually, I was really impressed by her when a customer walked in & with a friendly exuberance she said \"Welcome back!\" He may have been a regular, but the fact that she showed so much pleasure in seeing customers shows a lot about how this restaurant care about the service they provide. After we were done with our meal, another passing server even offered to clear our plates off the table - another clear indication to me of how this restaurant works as a team. Food was also great, I had the half rack of baby back ribs which came with two sides for $21.   If you're not a big eater, you can even share this with another person and be satisfied. Get their sweet tea also! So good! Overall, I enjoyed my dinner and the experience.",

Service was mediocre, rushed but OK. Never got offered a refill on tea. Given the cost and the fact that there is far better barbecue in the Phoenix area, I will definitely not come back.",

They even added a free appetizer just because we had to wait a little.   Everyone was gracious and kind. They even helped my friend get out of the restaurant in her scooter. Would dine there again many times. Highly recommended!  PS: the mini doughnuts are very tasty",

The manager was great and accommodated our big party, what AWESOME customer service. We ordered the Hog feast with baby back ribs and brisket, I have one word Deeelicious! We were given warm hand towels after enjoying our BBQ, what a nice surprise. But wait it doesn't end there when we were given or tab we were also handed fresh donuts. O M G, it was heaven in a bag. So go ahead and #TreatYoSelf by enjoying a nice meal in an establishment that has your best interest at heart.",

For our group of 7 we ordered two Q rolls, the spinach queso dip, and two whole hogs. It was plenty of food for everyone with some leftovers.   The Q Rolls are my absolute favorite. Incredible brisket wrapped in a egg roll type shell dipped in barbecue sauce. The spinach queso dip was good but overpriced for the portion size. The whole hog platter is amazing and has a little bit of everything for everyone. The best meats are the brisket and the pulled pork. There are two sauces available: the regular and the spicy. I didn't think the spicy tasted much different at all but it had good flavor.   Great service overall and to top it off they serve warm cinnamon sugar donuts for free at the end of your meal! Definitely check any of the locations out.",

    "text": "The service is nicely attentive and accommodating for our large party. After coming off my Austin BBQ withdrawals, I was looking forward to tender slabs of meat again. We showed up early for our party of 9 and the hostess quickly had our table setup. The dining area is on the dark side with pinpoint spotlights accenting the tables. It was nice but not great for trying to read the dark menus and see across the extended tables. Because of the size of our party we opted for 2 of the whole hog platters to taste every meat, a kale salad to feign being healthy and also a house salad, and a filet. The whole hog does not disappoint and 2 of them is just a grotesque amount of farm animal on a plate. It was all very tasty. I would get the chicken, sausage, pork ribs and brisket again. The beef ribs were gargantuan but tough. The meat did not want to be torn from the bone and could use another couple of hours breaking down. For the sides we had the broccolini, potatoes every way possible, and mac and cheese. The sides were yummie as well but there must be a strong love of garlic because the broccolini was drenched in garlic slime. The broccolini that managed to avoid getting bathed in garlic was perfectly roasted and tender. Overall this was nice bbq, they need to work on the beef ribs and tone down the garlic for my taste.",

The new mug she had brought to me was also dirty! Her customer service was very bad, there were not many people in the restaurant at the time we had gone in! She did not check on us but once when we first sat down we had not received any corn bread when that was a main thing my wife liked from this place.

Greeted by a friendly young lady and offered inside or patio seating.  We decided on the inside bar area. Great seat...TV's and get to watch the great mixologist! The seats were half booths facing the actual bar.  Started out with craft cocktails. Omg. Amazing.  One drink had reposado tequila/vanilla/cinnamon/lemon. The other was a Hendricks Gin/lavender/egg whites/lemon and edible flower.  Not lacking booze.... which is good because they were $12 .  Then we ordered food. Hubby had the 2 meats with 2 sides. Brisket and pulled pork. Baked potato and baked corn. I had a pulled pork sandwich with one side which is the potato salad. The potato salad I swear is like my Moms. Delicious!  Server brought us the corn bread which was warm and just so tasty.  We did order 2 beers on draft and they were local which I love. No room for dessert because we know they bring a brown bag of mini donuts with sugar. Such a great touch.  Over all just a wonderful night.  Oh and I would be remiss if I didn't mention our excellent server Ann. She was delightful. Attentive-without being intrusive and very informative. Thank you.",

I called in the to-go order at 11:30 am with no problems, but things went down hill quickly once we arrived. Ashley the \"general manager\" was very abrasive and abrupt and somewhat belittling to the waiters. One of our entrees was missing and Instead of apologizing for the oversight Ashley just kept saying \"well I don't have it\".  During this exchange one of the waiters gave us some donuts while Ashley retook the order...the donuts were raw.  told Ashley and she replied \"it's not my first day on the job. I told them to wait 10 minutes\"  Uhmmm ok... so now we are waiting for the entree to be remade while our other three orders get cold. While waiting, I notice another waiter come to get the same undercooked donuts they gave me.  I told him they were still raw and that he may want to wait for new ones...he put them in the bag and served them to some unsuspecting guest anyway. Our missing order finally comes up and we leave.  Only to get to our location and find that both kids cheeseburgers are practically raw even though we ordered them well done.  Called to the store and asked for the General Manager who I believed was Mark, got Ashley instead. After attempting to explain to her that we were very unhappy with our visit (when Ashley wasn't interrupting or talking over me) she told me that she was \"sorry I felt that way\"  and that she'd leave us a gift certificate to make up for it. Honestly, I would have been happy with an sincere apology. Hi",

The topper was excellent, good humored service.  10 thumbs up from our family!",

    "text": "Ashley was our server and she was fantastic! We always had what we needed, and she was super friendly as well.   Corn bread $0: We started with a basket of complimentary corn bread. It was soft, warm, and oh so good! I don't eat corn bread often, but this was one of the best I've had.   Baby Back Ribs Half Rack $22: The meat was good, not too tough. I love dipping in extra sauce, and was so excited when they brought out little pitchers of it. The sauce was pretty good. I tried both the regular and spicy, but it wasn't spicy at all. You get your choice of two sides, and I went with mac & cheese and beans. The mac & cheese was really creamy, and not super flavorful but still decent. I didn't like the baked beans too much. I tend to prefer them without meat, but here they have pieces of brisket in it. My friends ordered fries and roasted corn for their sides. The fries were nothing special, and the corn was too bland in my opinion. Of the sides I tried, I would only order the mac & cheese again in the future.   Mini Donuts $0: After we paid, we were given a brown bag of complimentary mini donuts. They were hot and fresh, and could easily become an addiction.   Photo Mention: Cajun Shrimp $14.50  *****  My Star Ratings:  1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry.  2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return.  3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to.  4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven't already.  5 Stars - AMAZING!!! Would plan my day or even a trip around eating here.",

    "text": "Dinner overall was just fair.     The corn bread was nice. It was crispy on top, light and fluffy. The Cajun Shrimp appetizer was delightful and very tasty.    Our ribs were well spiced but barely warm. The mashed potatoes were also luke warm. One serving contained a full half, unpeeled and not cooked potato. The restaurant gladly replaced the serving and offered us a dessert.    For dessert I choose the carrot cake. Unfortunately, it's not traditional carrot cake but a long thin slice with a glaze on top. The cream cheese frosting is one of the best parts of carrot cake. It also had an unusual flavoring to it. It may have been too much nutmeg or an aromatic flavor added to the batter or glaze.     Before leaving, we witnessed staff wiping a table, the chairs, then onto another table with the same rag. Big no-no.",

For drinks my friend had the Pineapple Passion and I had the Bobby's Mule. The drinks were strong and great, namely the Pineapple Passion. And yes, it really is served in a pineapple! For dinner we shared the three meat combo and for $31 it was a steal to adequately share between two people. On top of that, they come with two sides and we had opted for the mac and cheese and baked potato which were really good. For the meats, we had the baby back ribs, smoked sliced beef brisket, and the spicy smoked pink sausage. They were all amazing but the standout in my mind was the brisket. Trust me when I say I highly doubt you can go wrong with any of the meats but if you have doubts in choosing anything, do yourself a favor and go for the brisket. I can only dream of the brisket in NYC to be as good if I'm being frank. If there ever is an off-chance that I'm in AZ again, I know where I'm going back to for solid BBQ.",

Rack of beef ribs: for $30, this is a good deal and you can split it between 2-3 people. Comes with 4 large ribs, and two sides (sides are very small). Ribs were cooked really well with a decent amount of meat on them. Definitely ask for extra BBQ sauce (no extra charge) and bc you'll need it. For sides, we got the greens (brussel sprouts and broccolini) and shoestring fries. Broccolini was excellent!! But shoestring fries were just OK  Two meat platter: for about $30 again, we got the brisket and the chicken. Brisket was super tender and melted in your mouth, while I thought the chicken was just OKAY. Again this comes with two small sides. We got the Mac and cheese which was very creamy and cheesy, and the mashed potatoes which were buttery and smooth  The cornbread starters were excellent like everyone else here has been raving about, but I didn't think the donuts were THAT good...ours came out cold.   Altogether, a solid BBQ place if you're craving it!",

    "text": "Good food. The sides are the best part - especially the Mac & Cheese. Highly recommend for the food.  We've been to this location twice and I've been to the I-17 larger location many times in my life. The Biltmore location is quite small, but we're very glad they have it there, near us.      We were seated near the exit to the bathrooms and the kitchen. Quite often I could hear servers coming through there, talking to each other, using the F-word. That was unprofessional; it's too bad so many people these days use that and other similar words in their everyday vocabulary. Management should speak to their staff about that.    For the entire restaurant, there's only a one-seater restroom for the ladies and one for the men. I really had to go quickly, and someone was locked in the ladies' one-seater room for at least 15 minutes. I finally went into the men's room to use it after 3 men went in and out of there pretty quickly. Not a great experience being in the men's room - but hey - it worked. Sometimes it just takes longer to go - so I don't hold a grudge about the ladies' room not being available (other women with their children kept having to wait as well, and kept coming back to check on the room throughout our whole time there). It's just something to be aware of. The sinks are outside of the two one-seater restrooms. A little different, but it works; no biggie. I've been to other restaurants with the same concept. I prefer having the sinks in the restrooms themselves.       The atmosphere on Father's day was lively and extremely loud, as you can imagine. We could barely hear each other. The worst part was a table of about five adults, 2 kids and 1 toddler. That toddler screamed the high-pitched harsh scream all the way through the entire time were there. Restaurant managers can't do much about that, I suppose. The dads/grandfathers at that table were all at one end and two women were with the kids. The mom of the screamer didn't seem to mind at all that her child was ruining everyone else's Father's Day experience. She almost seemed to be provoking the screams by continuously shoving a sippy cup to the toddler's mouth. Oi vey.     We will be back for sure -- just not for a while, and certainly not on Father's day. Reservations are recommended.",

    "text": "In town for a few days last week & WOW... absolutely amazing BBQ! Reminds me of a place here in San Diego called Phil's BBQ, but I gotta give credit where credit is due... Bobby Q's is definitely better than Phil's. Even love their name (they ought to have a picture of Elmer Fudd going after Bugs Bunny yelling wascally wabbit on the menu).  I got the full beef ribs order (a little pricey, but well worth it)... 3 bones of big beefy mouth watering juicy meat. Not sure if this is how they do it, but it tasted to me like how my folks used to make them. Boil the ribs to get the meat soft enough to practically fall off the bone & then throw on the BBQ for a bit to get that charred BBQ flavor... perfect! I wasn't wild about the sides, but the BBQ easily made up for it... pretty much too full from the ribs to eat much of the sides anyway. I got the fries, which tasted descent, but were shoestring fries which get cold quickly. Also had the roasted corn, but it tasted like regular corn on the cob with no roasted flavor to it. Again, wasn't bad, but not what I expected by the description. The cornbread was pretty good... nice moistness to it so it doesn't crumble apart when eating. My friend got the pulled pork sandwich & loved it!  Good cocktail & beer selection. I'm an IPA guy, but I didn't know most of the ones here since I'm not local. I told our waiter what type I like & he suggested the Hazy (?) IPA, which was a great choice! We took a Lyft so we could have a drink or 2, which after this IPA, I had 2 more.  Now for the trifecta for a 5 star experience... the service. Our server was Mike, who looks a lot like a younger Chris Pratt. Awesome service & a genuinely friendly person. He saw we had the same cell phone case, which is a beast of a case (the case has to be screwed together & you could drop this thing off a 10 story building & the phone won't break), which opened the door to a short conversation in general. He checked back often enough we never had to wait for another drink or anything. Very well spoken & polite... always said thank you/your welcome for anything we ordered or asked for. If I were local, I'd be eating here 2-3 x's a month & would request his section whenever I'd come. I just might have to drive back here someday for the BBQ when it's not 110 degrees at 9 at night.",

    "text": "This visit to the Biltmore Bobby Q's means we've been to all three of their locations. Happily, we've also had great meals at all three! Father's Day seemed like the obvious time to go. Dad's + BBQ = a perfect combination! Our waiter said Father's Day is their busiest day of the year, makes sense. Speaking of our waiter, he was great! Very attentive and nice.  We went at 11 when they opened and didn't have a wait, but they were already pretty full when we left. As always, they started us off with a basket of cornbread and whipped butter. Delish.  My husband got the 3 meat combo with baby back ribs, brisket and pulled pork, he loved them all. His favorite were the ribs. Super tender, flavor all the way through. My 8 year old son had the pulled pork sandwich with mac and cheese on the side and he destroyed it! If you haven't taken your kids out for BBQ yet, do it. Even picky eaters will like it.  I had the BBQ loaded baked potato with pulled chicken, it's my go-to choice at Bobby Q's. You can pick any of the meats to top a gigantic baked potato. I could only eat half of it! Another reason our waiter was great is that at this location they normally only offer the BBQ potato during the week, but he asked the kitchen to do it anyway, and they did. I had corn as my side, and it was the only real miss. Just underseasoned, nothing special.  The cutest thing is that you get a paper bag of cinnamon sugar mini donuts when you leave!",

The happy hour drinks are pretty solid. $5 for a pitcher which gets you about 3 beers from it. And they have some good beers for the pitcher not. Not just your normal domestics. For apps we got the brisket nachos and the pretzel. The nachos were large in size. The pretzel was big as well and came with beer cheese, marinara, and a mustard sauce. The pretzel was delicious so we ordered another. Patio seating was nice as it's covered so stays cool during the summer. Definitely will be back for some actual bbq.",

Admittedly I'm a bit of a temperature diva and I asked them to heat up my mashed potatoes (they were warm but I just wanted them hotter) Joanna (the manager) was so friendly and made it very clear she cares about the well being of the restaurant and each guests dining experience. It became abundantly clear that she cares by watching her interact with her staff as a leader not a boss by working along side them and helping service run smooth .   Kudos Bobby Q's",

The brisket is the best in the world. The baby back ribs also qualify as the best ribs I've ever had.  Cornbread to start is excellent. Best cornbread anywhere.  They also make some mean drinks. The old fashioned with the maple syrup is two thumbs up - best old fashioned. The princess peach - don't let the name fool you - is a zesty refreshment.  Service is very good and the decor is intriguing with the feel of something special yet comfortable and relaxing. Of course the smokey meat flavor wafting through the air is the best part of the decor. Decor A+  Can't recommend this place enough. A lot of the bests are available right here.

    "text": "Out of all the restaurants I've been to in the world, Bobby-Q has a special place in my heart.  Bobby-Q came up while I was searching for some good restaurants in Phoenix. They take reservations so I decided to book a time slot for myself!   I arrived on time and the two gorgeous ladies at the front desk greeted me and led me to my table, a perfect spot that was facing the TV, which was also playing my favourite sport - the NBA. Within a minute, my server came by with the menu. I ordered a cocktail, and my server pointed out that the Q-Rolls are one of their best sellers.   When my server was back with my cocktail, some water, and cornbread, I ordered the Q-Rolls as an appetizer, and Half Baby Back Ribs as my main. I sat back and enjoyed the game with my cocktail, and my food came in no time. The Q-Rolls were amazing - the crispy outer layer wraps the pork which was tender and perfectly smoked. The edges of the pork were slightly crispy too which I really enjoyed. I didn't even bother dipping in too much of the sauces because it was so delicious that I didn't want the sauce to overpower the actual food.   The Baby Back Ribs arrived with the two sides I ordered - brussel sprouts and corn. I was clearly trying to be healthy, which is why I avoided the tempting mashed potato and mac and cheese. Without much expectation for the sides, I bit into the brussel sprouts and boy were they good! I would have mistaken it as an actual dish if it weren't placed in the same plate as the ribs. The corn was also the best \"side dish corn\" I've ever had. I love how Bobby-Q puts in effort even in their side dishes. Finally onto the star of the night - the baby back ribs. Trying to be civilized, I used fork and knife throughout my meal. I had my fork in the meat, and my knife ready to cut a piece off. I was not expecting the meat to just slide off the bone...It was so tender, and so well cooked that it took me zero effort to eat baby back ribs with a fork and knife! I don't think I have ever had such good ribs ever in my life.   During my meal, my server came by couple times. I usually like to use the word \"check up on me\", but he just came by casually to have a short convo with me about my food and my trip, and it felt like an actual non-obligated conversation. I learned that he was from Thailand which I will be visiting soon! The super friendly and (very) attractive manager, Joanna also came by to see how things were with the parties around the restaurant, including myself. And to make my whole experience at Bobby-Q even better, the owner of the restaurants came by to say hi and thanks after he heard me saying good words about the food. Kindest old man ever.  I never pack my leftovers when I'm on vacation, simply because I have planned out all the restaurants that I want to visit. But I couldn't stand such amazing food to go to waste, so I packed them all for a late night munchie.  After I got the bill, my super amazing server brought me some of their dessert of the day to go. I was already so full from the food, but secretly had a bite in the car...and ended up finishing it all. I would give this place a 6/5 star if I could!   There are too many restaurants nowadays that try to satisfy the customers while prioritizing their profits, but Bobby-Q make sure that every single customer leaves with a happy tummy and smile.   Thank you Bobby-Q for really setting the bar high!! I will come again if I ever visit Phoenix.",

I honestly don't know what happened but it might just be the fact that I  visited Kansas City and Dallas for some serious wood smoked bbq and  that may have embedded a new standard for my BBQ taste buds.  I had the beef ribs and the brisket and I would recommend the beef ribs over the dry and non-smoke flavored brisket.  I would have to call out Bobby for not smoking their meats because it had a clear oven baked flavor over a smoked filled, wood-tasty meat.  If you are Phoenix raised resident then Bobby is a protein rich  bbq, but if you were raised in the Bible-belt, then Bobby Q would be reminiscent of a fourth round draft pick on the corner of your newly developed Kansas City or Dallas suburb with small yards and a newly built Costco around the corner.  The home grown art and science of backyard bbq masters who pick the perfect balance of wood and charcoal would frown on this suburban destination.",

Now about the meal it was very yummy especially the corn bread, chicken and baby back ribs that fell off the bones, baked potato with everything and Mac and cheese. We got our check and we also got a small bag of just made cinnamon and sugar small donuts.  We will go back again.",

They have a cave man barbarian who run's the kitchen and he clearly does not know that green's can taste great.   One of our member's had ordered a veggie patty no garnish (pickles and onions and thousand island dressing which is odd) the veggie patty was not actually a veggie patty but a Japanese style rice cake with a few beet's and maybe one or two whole black beans, it was hideous and disgusting it fell apart and was like biting into a bowl of minute rice with beet's.  Now as a side note we all eat many different thing at many different places in many different states and this was not a veggie patty yet a grain patty, because rice my dear barbarian cook dummy is not a vegetable please check your food pyramid.     Now some people may like potatoes that taste like potato salad but i am sorry when we go to a steak or barbecue joint we expect \"butter and potato\" which in turn is just mashed potatoes not potato salad, here they use an over abundance of sour cream, green onions and celery all mixed in and whipped till they are a bleach white color, the base was a great try with red russet potatoes for that good wholesome taste but it was just sour cream overly tart and oniony no potato taste at all it was depressing.   Now for the aesthetic of the restaurant it was a nice enough looking place, a little shoddy for being a biltmote location, the plants were a nice touch but the bugs EVERYWHERE flying all over the place were just gross we kept clapping trying to kill them over our meals but couldn't they were just too fast and abundant. The air was cool yet humid inside most likely since its swamp cooled inside you can tell there is some vacuum coming from the front doors sucking air into the restaurant pulling in humid misted air thru the 3/8th inch gap.  The customer service was absolutely horrendous the waiter did not once ask how we were or how our food was, it may have been since he saw us all clapping and swatting trying to kill the flying bugs but as a CSR this is inexcusable.   The staff near the door were friendly and told us to have a good day, overall i'd say its definitely NOT worth the visit, the average price is a solid 25$ no tip no drink for a measly burger (butter bun was great) and dry hard fresh fries, sour potatoes, soggy pulled pork (was good) and sad vegetables.  Don't visit this location unless you want to shed a tear knowing culvers 8$ meal is much more seasoned and rich for 1/3rd the price which is a fast food chain    Thanks for reading but heed my warning",

The beef ribs are hugeeeeeeeeee!! So huge & sososo good. I didn't even get to the delicious sides- the mac & cheese is BOMB! Hella cheesy with a great taste, fries are always good & so is the baked potato. Tonight I had the rib eye & it was cooked perfectly, so juicy & melted in my mouth! The fact you get free cinnamon sugar doughnuts  So clearly Bobby Q is the best! Oh & their carry out is just as good as eating there! Double points for that one.",

The barbecue chicken fell off the bone, the cornbread was addictive and my pulled pork was out of this world. We sat outside which was so pleasant as they also have water sprayers if it it's too hot. My neighbors said that they never knew about this place and that they were definitely going to come back. Very fun atmosphere as well!",

Growing up my family made the trip to the west valley location off the I-17. I'm happy to see this restaurant grow and now be in my neck of the woods. Slightly different menu but still the delicious great Smoked BBQ taste.   Ashlynn was my server today who by far exceeds too customer service. My table dined on some tasty smoked wings that came with three different dipping sauces. Shoestring Potato Fries that are the best I have ever had, cornbread and a tasty watermelon cooler to wash it down. Everything was served warm and freshly cooked. Not only did the food taste well but the presentation made everything tempting to eat. So tempting the tables around us were eyeing our food.   The ambiance is nice and the decor is a modern BBQ house affair. There is patio seating with TVs and full bar. They even give you doughnuts to go. Had a great experience and will be back due to the level of service from Ashlynn.",

It's smaller than the other Bobby Q's, but just as tasty, with the same menu!  The babyback ribs are really good! The meat is so tender, but remains a good chew and char! Perfectly smoked with just a brush of BBQ sauce!  A full rack is definitely shareable, or if you are absolutely starving, you might be able to tackle it!  I had the brisket, I asked for a leaner portion, and they delivered! It was perfect! I got the choose 2, so my other protein choice was the smoked chicken. I actually didn't care that much for the poultry. But the brisket was so satisfying, I was happy with it!  The cornbread was scrumptious! Lightly sweetened, with whipped butter!  At the end of the meal, we were served freshly made cinnamon and sugar doughnuts, brought in a brown paper bag! Who can turn down a hot doughnut? Not us... they were so good!  Overall, I think if you're craving BBQ, you can't go wrong at Bobbie Q's",

I ordered the Q Lada as well and it was awesome - it tasted just like a Miami Vice.  I usually go to the Bobby Q in Mesa, but this was my first time in the Biltmore location. I found their bathrooms really nice and their service impeccable, as per usual.  My whole party was satisfied, including the vegetarian member of our party who enjoyed their variety of sides and their market salad!  We also were able to sample beers before ordering, so I thought that was cool.  This location also offered us hot hand towels, which was never offered to us in the Mesa location - interesting and much appreciated after our strenuous 4 day backpacking trip!",

I didn't get to peek around inside but the patio is adorable (garden vibes!) and perfect for a girl's day or special event with friends. They serve you mini cornbreads and sugar donuts first, which is obviously a v strong start.   The brunch menu has a TON of options - it was actually hard to choose! - and the food was definitely the star of the show. I'm adding some pictures but we ended up ordering the pulled pork benedict (served on cornbread!), cauliflower mash, chilaquiles, and egg white rotisserie chicken avocado toast. We also got mimosa bottle service!  10/10 will definitely be back!",

He suggested the combo with baby back ribs and beef brisket.  Shoestring fries had lots of crunch and a delicious fried potato flavor.  Steak fries were also very crunchy but the flavor was not as tasty as the shoe string fries.  Baby back ribs were fall off the bone tender with a sweet slightly tangy carmelized bbq sauce.  Nice smoky flavor from being smoked in mesquite and almond wood.  Beef brisket was extremely tender with a sweet sauce that had a bit of a tangy component and a little bit of a spicy kick.  For dessert fresh donuts were brought out.  I liked the fresh fried flavor with a bit of sweetness from the sprinkled on sugar.  Arizona has some impressive bbq.  Next time I visit Bobby Q Bbq I might try a variety of their meats to go.",

The restaurant is casual and energetic, bordering on noisy. They have a variety of smoked meats and we tried the pork and smoked sausage which were delicious and generously sized. The sides which accompanied our dinners were good but not great. The macaroni and cheese was creamy but lacked flavor. The corn side was swimming in liquid but tasted fresh. We loved the complimentary corn bread which came to our table warm and lovely. We'll go back for the tender pulled pork. It's definitely the best we've ever eaten!",

    "text": "The last review of 2018: dinner at the bar at Bobby Q. I had eaten at another Bobby Q location in the past and had fond memories so I was excited to check this place out. It was hit and miss.. hence the 3 overall. They certainly have some stuff going for them and some stuff that didn't blow us away...  Hostess was super friendly as we didn't have reservations and it was New Year's Eve. As we were waiting for a table two seats at the bar opened up so we took them. Two bartenders took care of us and the service as great. Friendly and attentive without feeling rushed, we ended up not being in the mood to drink but our waters were refilled and we weren't treated like outcasts for not ordering a cocktail. Service - 5.   The interior is super nice, I really liked the vibe. The bar is cute and has some lights on it and they have a really nice outdoor section in the front. It looked really cozy, they had heaters going and it was covered. Would definitely be a great spot to hang out for drinks. Ambiance - 5.   After ordering our meals, they brought us a little basket of cornbread. I'm not huge on cornbread and neither is my girlfriend but dang this cornbread was GOOD!! Honestly, probably the best cornbread we have had around. Cornbread - 5.   We both ordered 2 meat plates which come with two sides of your choosing. When the plates arrived there was a HUGE amount of food but for the price made sense. (~$27 each). Portion size - 4.   At this point, we both had some hits and misses. I do want to note that they bring your meat out with sauce on it. Most bbq places I've been bring it on the side or have it on the side at the table. My girlfriend doesn't like a lot of sauce, if any at times, and there didn't seem to be anything on the menu indicating that it comes with sauce already on top. Our fault for not clarifying for it to be on the side anyways, but just a heads up if you're picky about levels.   Pulled pork - 3. Pretty decent, I liked the sauce so it made it tasty. Not bad.   Brisket - 3. For brisket this was on the better end of what I've had in the past.. but didn't blow me away either. The sauce helped.   Mashed Potatoes - 2. Just not great. Could be worse. For the price point didn't seem worth it.   Mac N Cheese - 3. Not too fancy that it's too rich but pretty basic.   Potato Salad - 3. Tasty but again nothing to write home about.   While you get a ton of food, we just felt like we've had better bbq for a cheaper price point. But again, the atmosphere and service were great so you pay for that too. We didn't try any of their cocktails but they had some that sounded good so perhaps that is the way to go if you stop in.   All in all it was a decent experience I'm just not sure if we would return unless in the area or with others.",

She is usually spot on for recommendations.  We go to the closest location in the Biltmore and from the minute we walked in, this was a winner.  The decor and ambiance was exactly what we were looking for.  This is not a cafeteria feeling place.  It is warm and comfortable with a great little patio and bar area.  We sat in the bar and were waited on by Emilee.  We both ordered the Brisket.  When it arrived, the portions of roasted corn, cole slaw and brisket were generous.  The brisket was juicy and had an amazing flavor.  Emilee brought us the sweet bbq sauce and the spicy bbq sauce.  We tried both and figured out that they were both delicious but were even better if we mixed them.  Needless to say, we could barely walk out of here from being so full.  It is now our favorite by a long shot.  If you want great bbq in a fun place with a great vibe, come here!  Well done Bobby-Q!",

We had our favorite side the coleslaw and tried the roasted corn which was good but felt the corn could have been roasted a little longer. Since it was a birthday celebration we were given a comp'd dessert; the bread pudding a good cinnamon raisin bread with a light creamy topping very moist and so yummy.

We had eaten at the I 17 location before and were really looking forward to the food. For the price the food just did not have the wow factor that we had had at the other location. I had ordered the half rack of baby back ribs which did fall off the bone but the flavor was just a little bit different. I also order the Q roll as a appetizer which had good flavor but was dry even with the dipping sauces. I also felt the food was maybe a little too salty maybe that was the difference for me that night. I would return to this location for drinks and lunch but most likely not dinner.",

I can honestly say, I know this is not KC BBQ, but it is really darn good! The only recommendation is to get some great signage out in front. I know you are new, but I almost missed the place with the banner.  The decor is surprisingly nice and friendly. I was not expecting this look and feel as the location is in a strip mall. That being said, it is done very well inside.  On our visit, the staff was marvelous, from getting seated to our waitress to the Manager, everyone really went out of their way to make you feel welcomed. It felt very real and warm and not fake. Kudo's to all, especially our waitress Rachel. She was fantastic and really took care of us.  We ordered the Family Feast for our entree. If you want to try something new, this platter has an assortment of meats to try, Ribs, Chicken, Brisket and more. It is more than enough for two and could possibly feed three and is a great deal at $39!  The chicken was very moist and tasty, the rib meat literally fell off the bone and the other items were also tasty. I was a bit surprised that the BBQ sauce does have a bit of a bite so be ready. Nothing bad, but surprising for a sauce.  The house salad was made as requested and to top it off they give you a few small sugar donuts that have the look and taste of beignets. Really tasty!! :) I wanted more of those to go with the gelato I got across the street.  So in summary:  Ambiance - 5 Service - 5+ Cleanliness - 5 Food quality and taste - 5 Bang for Buck - 5  I wanted to try their steaks, but the bang for the buck on this platter cannot be beaten. I highly recommend this establishment as they nailed all the things you look for in your dining experience! :)",

However, after spending a weekend camping with the Boy Scouts and trying to come up with a place to eat on our way to Zoolights, I remembered seeing that Bobby Q's had recently opened a new location at 32nd Street and Camelback and we decided to give it a try.  Located just East of Safeway, in the space where Mexx32 used to be housed, Bobby Q's is a dark, warm space that is very inviting. Because our November weather is so perfect, we chose to sit on the patio and it was great.  Our server, Joseph, did an excellent job and filled us in on the specials and his favorites. I went with the three meat platter and picked babyback ribs, brisket and pulled pork along with a side of grilled vegetables. My wife and kids were all in the mood for burgers and they all ordered the Smokehouse Burger.   Everyone enjoyed their meals very much! The meat on my ribs was perfectly cooked and falling off the bones and my brisket and pulled pork were excellent with just enough bbq sauce added to flavor them perfectly. The rest of my family enjoyed their burgers and even though the boys didn't finish their burgers, they took the leftovers to go and warmed them up for lunch the next day!  Service was very attentive and they made sure that they refilled our sodas, tea and lemonade whenever they started to get empty. Pricing was very reasonable for a family of four and this is certainly a place to which I would return.  Bobby Q's, you're a hit in my book!",

    "text": "OMG BOBBY Q'S YOU ARE TESTING MY PHYSICAL BEING WITH YOUR AMAZING FALL OFF THE BONE RIBS WOULD YOU STOP????? I was raised in Georgia, so barbecue was basically a food group that was presented at basically any family gathering, duh. I guess you can say that after having BBQ so many times, I can probably tell you what is quality and what is not. Bobby Q's is where it's at. I had such an amazing experience here.   I brought the boo a week or two after the grand opening: the first thing on our table were two perfectly baked corn bread rolls with a dollop of butter (basically already speaking our language, southerners put butter on freaking everything). They were so delicious! We had to stop ourselves from eating them because we did not want to spoil our appetites for the Q Rolls, our main entree, and the mac & cheese side. We decided to split a rack of ribs between us for our entree. The ribs, we learned, were smoked in house and were brought out with the three kinds of signature Bobby Q sauce. As soon as I tried to cut into a rib it fell apart, clean off the bone- something you don't see very often unless the chef knows what they are doing... and BOY did they know.   We basically ate that in 3 minutes flat and then chowed down on some Q Rolls: small taquitos stuffed with beef brisket and served with a chipotle-style sauce. Our side of mac and cheese really could not be beat. Some BBQ restaurants will do the most with everything in the restaurant BUT mac and cheese. This was so good, you could definitely tell it was freshly made (no clumps, super creamy and heavy).  In short, Bobby Q's is definitely now my top choice of BBQ.   -Outdoor seating  -Outdoor seating does not allow puppers -Great date night spot  -Bar shares the outdoor patio",

We had a fantastic server who is a guy who moved from one of their other locations. Took great care of our large party. My wife asked for a drink from the bar and said \"surprise me\" and the bartender mixed some fruity concoction that she liked so much that she had a second. Wow! I had the full rack of baby backs and the meat was tender and flavorful. Sauce was just right. Others in the party had the filet mignon which they said was outstanding -- That's a big deal in Phoenix/Scottsdale that has so many high end steakhouses. Also, they are open late -- after midnight most nights. We will be back -- often!",

Barbecue sounded good and Bobby Q's came up as \"hot and new\" so we gave it a try. When we were seated we were soon greeted by Demitri who ensured we had a nice dining experience.  Folks, from the time we sat down to the time we left the service and dinner were absolutely fantastic. We ordered the Whole Hog so we could try a variety of meats (pork ribs, prime brisket, pork ribs and roasted chicken)....WOW!  The sides were perfect and of course we had desert. Needless to say the Bread pudding was delicious. Did we eat it all?  No way. The portions are generous. The whole hog dinner could feed a family and that is what we plan on doing in the coming weeks!  This is by far our best BBQ restaurant!",

    "text": "Bobby Q's has never disappointed me, or my business colleagues.  I highly recommend anything on this menu from salads to steaks.  Their mac 'n cheese is super creamy, thick with 4 cheeses.  Their Q roll is the taquito bomb -  a must try appetizer.  I usually get the pulled pork sandwich, but recently, I had one of the best burgers ever at Bobby Qs.  There is a 1-star rating from Mike L. which I cannot believe to be True.  I've spent a lot of time in KC, South Carolina, and Texas areas in my lifetime.  Eating out a lot on business and I am a BBQ aficionado .  Believe me,  I  have had some really great BBQ, and some really bad BBQ (especially in KC where even bad BBQ can stay open because BBQ there is like burgers and pizza everywhere else).  I have about 30 BBQ books I've collected over the years, and I've been brining meat and smoking for 30 years now.  Their BBQ sauce is decent, but certainly nowhere near \"piss\" as one person made in his brief and highly negative comments.  I think it is better than many BBQ sauces offered at restaurants.  My guess, this reviewer owns a restaurant nearby and isn't happy Bobby Q's will take business away.  Bobby Q's is similar in ways to Pappadeaux Seafood Kitchen in Peoria - which is my favorite fish restaurant in AZ, and beyond and so is Bobby Q's my favorite BBQ joint.  Yeah I've had a particular item that is better at another restaurants somewhere in the nation, but these 2 restaurants are favorites because they always deliver a consitent \"Yum,\" and occasional \"Wow!\"   In my life, I got to spend a lot of time in Louisiana and eat at 5-star restaurants where a particular fish dish was amazing.  Again, what makes Bobby Qs and Pappadeuax a favorite is their extensive menus in a particular food type, and the food served is always very good to amazing depending on what is ordered, and when.  There is never just a decent, or sub par experience at either of these restaurants.  I always leave saying, \"Man that was GOOD,\" or \"Wow, that was Amazing!\"   I've always left Booby Qs wanting to come back again the same week, if I could.  As a point of reference to a reader, let me say that the Cheesecake Factory I believe tries to do something like this with a vast and varied menu, but I think they fail at it where Bobby Q's doesn't.  I've only had sub-par to decent food at Cheesecake Factory excluding their cheesecakes which never disappoints!  For me, the Cheesecake Factory has never delivered amazing food where Bobby Q's has.  Also, I think the Elephant Bar with it's varied menu as being maybe one step above the Cheesecake Factory in regards to taste of the entrees - they are consistently good.",

    "text": "In a word:  WOW!  As I've said in previous reviews, Traci and I are fortunate to live in the 85018 with so many fantastic restaurants in the area - practically within walking distance.  As others may have said, this is a crowed Safeway shopping center, and it starts with parking.  Don't get all crapped out trying to find a place to park if one's not nearby the restaurant.  Learn the local way - use the complimentary valet parking area dedicated to the two restaurants just to the north of the restaurant off 32nd Street.  You'll see the signs.  Bobby Q's has big shoes to fill - the real estate / lease costs for this space has spiked dramatically over the years.  Mexx32 was awesome, and Lenny made that cool place work to his credit, but Bobby Q's gutted much of the restaurant to enhance the bar/patio/seating, so they have made an incredible investment in the place.  Was it worth it?  We think so!  Six to eight months of the year they'll benefit from the patio/bar combo area - which we love in a restaurant.  Very inviting, friendly and an open greeting when entering.  Terrific addition!  As we all know, service is key to a successful restaurant, so they did the smart thing:  Got a bartender who knows his stuff and who has worked for them at another location in the Valley.  Chris knows his way around the menu and the cocktail choices.  He was helpful and knowledgeable.  He recommended two of his favorite 'brown liquor' choices and we were not disappointed.  Both delicious and beautifully presented.  The rubber meets the road with good food, and the melt-in-your-mouth cornbread did not disappoint in getting our appetite in high gear.  Because it was our first time in (and won't be our last for sure!) we decided to try the \"Whole Hog Heaven\".  GREAT call!  A little of everything... Perfect for 2 or 3 people if you bring your appetite.  We just about finished it - but not quite.  Delicious, smokey, tender and flavorful baby back ribs or beef ribs (Pick both) AND your choice of two:  pork, prime brisket, sausage or chicken.  AND three sides (think the best BBQ choices in your mind and they'll be there).  Bottom line:  we liked EVERYTHING.  But If there was one criticism - it's the beef ribs are work.  They're not 'fall off the bone' like the baby backs.  A bit messy, but delicious.  Ultimately, we had a fantastic meal!  Great service!  Amazing ambiance!  What more do you need or want?  Highly recommend going to Bobby Q's!  You'll be able to personalize your meal and your head start is checking out their menu before you go.  A must - just be prepared for your mouth to start watering!  :)    Enjoy!",

The flavor was perfect and really did not need sauce. I did use a little and their spicy was perfect. One thing though, I called and asked if they had burnt ends and the girl said they did but they were on the menu. What I got was brisket and nothing about them resembled \"burnt ends\". Overall I thought it was very good. Enjoy!",

The BBQ is is AMAZING. The baby backs and brisket are a must. Joe (the bearded one) is the best server we have had in a very long time! The team at the Biltmore location has their act together.

Didn't even have the time to stop and listen to me. Just kept repeating to me that she cant help call grub hub, call grub hub over and over .. had she explained that the restaurant was not the delivery service I would have picked up on it.

The salad was excellent...pomegranate,  butternut squash,  apple cider vinegar and feta over crisp greens.   The prime rib was cooked to perfection.  Even the potato was perfect.

    "text": "For the last decade plus, Bobby-Q has been consistently delivering quality BBQ at their sole I-17 location. And then recently, almost unexpectedly, they branched out, opening a second similarly styled location in Mesa. And then, rather surprisingly, I read that they would be opening up a third location in the building that previously housed the mediocre Mexx32.  Being a huge fan of Bobby-Q, I've always found this expansion a bit concerning. But let's face it: the dude ran a very successful chain called Bobby McGee's for many years, so I think he knows a thing or two about the restaurant industry.  This location is a bit different in the sense that it's a scaled down version of Bobby-Q. The menu is the same, the food is identical, it's just all confined to a smaller space. And there's nothing wrong with that.  Bobby-Q is one of the few restaurants that I rate as a five-star experience. Not so much because of one particular item that blows me away, but because it's one of the few places I've found where you can order a table full of food, including sandwiches, appetizers, and sides - and virtually every damned item is delicious!   The Q-Rolls are an essential starter and are packed with some excellent smoked prime brisket. Additionally, the complimentary cornbread is leagues above those cold muffins that most people dish out.  For the actual meal, my girlfriend and I usually order the pulled pork, which has yet to disappoint. There's a subtle smokiness to the meat that's consistent in flavor and texture. And unlike most BBQ joints, Bobby-Q is one of the few that I've found that doesn't skimp on side quality. The mac and cheese is simple, but similar to the cornbread, exceeds the quality of what you will find elsewhere. The mashed potatoes, baked potato, and even the French fries are on par. I mean, seriously, they make it all look so easy!  Throw in some freshly made donuts that are provided before parting and you'll find that even the most jaded diners won't find much to complain about.  Rarely can you go wrong with some Bobby-Q!",

Food:  Comes with complimentary cornbread, which is delicious, made fresh!   Ordered the shrimp appetizer- comes with 3-4 huge garlic breadsticks and about 8 fairly large shrimps.  Shrimp has a good smoky flavor and the garlic sauce is fits well with the shrimp.  Although, it is a bit too oily for my taste.  Entree- Ordered the two meat combo, beef brisket and South Carolina ribs.  It came with two sides ordered the mash potatoes and roasted corn.  Beef brisket is absolutely delicious, good amount of fat with the balance of the meat.  Ribs were my favorite though, fall off the bone literally, the bbq sauce has a kick to it which I also really enjoyed.  After the meal, they gave complimentary donut holes that were surprisingly good.  Service was on point, owner I believe always checked on everyone very cool hangout spot and environment to be in.  Excellent food and place.",

But don't think this is the extent of their culinary repitiore, because I would literally kill for the prime rib....kidding....or am I ;) We were greeted with all smiles by the host crew and our server Amanda is a crafts-person and a delight! From the modest beginning of a honey-touched cornbread to the final bite (and beyond) is sheer decadence. This is our 4th trip but it is fresh and wonderful as if our 1st each and every time. I don't usually gush but I am gushing like a schoolgirl as her prom date arrives! The \"beyond\" is just as you think the meal is over, they surprise you with fresh donuts that rival any fresh churro.  Ten stars!",

Unfortunately,I can't remember his name but he tended to our every need, gave us the right amount of time to order even when weren't ready at first. He provided a great description of the items on the menu and made great suggestions. The patio was lovely and it was great even in May. The food was delicious! I didn't have time to even snap a picture but the hash is a must!You also can't beat the great Mimosa deal on 1/2 off a bottle with juices provided, and of course the complimentary mini donuts and corn bread. Overall a great experience and I will definitely be returning & recommending!",

We got 2 orders of the \"Whole Hog\" and chose 1 order with beef ribs and the other with baby-back. The baby-back ribs were great - juicy and tender. The beef ribs, the brisket, and pulled pork were kinda dry, and definitely not worth ordering. The sides were good, but they are hard to mess up. We got a baked potato, mashed potatoes, and mac 'n cheese. The cornbread was solid, too. Again, it was good, but there are other places to spend your money. Also, I don't think we got our Yelp check-in discount.",

    "text": "My Phoenix work office isn't too far from the Bobby Qs off the 17 fwy on N 27th Ave. In fact, that location had been on my radar for YEARS; but, never made it out there for whatever reason. Then, one day, I found myself driving around the Biltmore area, trying to kill time before my flight and happen to be hungry. Lo and behold, I see a Bobby Qs. Meant to be? Maybe. But, sure, why not?  I was there for an early lunch because it definitely wasn't crowded. The clientele were fairly well-dressed. Dressed in a zip up workout sweater, tee and yoga pants, I definitely stuck out. Service was excellent and my server was very attentive and helpful, offering suggestions and answering my questions.  I ended up ordering the lunch platter sampler. My choices of meats were brisket, pork ribs and sausage. For my sides, I picked potato salad, added pecan coleslaw and it came with cornbread. The brisket was a bit on the dry side and the ribs were okay. I was told that the Q was cooked on site, but it didn't have much of that smokey flavor you would expect. When you add the BBQ sauce, it makes a decent meal. But, I'm not a fan of drowning my meat in sauce. I did enjoy the sausage and the cornbread was fantastic. The coleslaw and potato salad were kinda bland.   At $18 for the sampler platter, it's on par for what other BBQ joints charge. The plate is enough that it could easily be split with a friend or significant other. Curiosity satisfied, I just found Bobby Q just A-OK. For Phoenix, I'd rate it a 4-star. But just based on past Q experience, it gets a 3.5 rounded down to a 3 from me, since I doubt that this place will be the first that I think of, when I am craving BBQ.",

Our server whose name (apologize!) was terrific. Came right over to promptly greet us, explain the menu, and grab drinks. Continued to check on us throughout and was chatty and friendly without overdoing it. Five star service! Now on to the most important thing: the food! we ordered the Q rolls as starter... very tasty altho I would say if you plan to order bbq or steaks for dinner maybe overdoing it on the meats ordering the Q rolls as apps, but they were tasty regardless. For dinner we ordered the whole hog platter, which is a huge platter of meats u choose and 3 sides for 60 bucks. They brought it out and first impression was WOW! Its a lotta food for 60 bucks, even more than I thought! We got brisket, pulled pork, baby backs and beef ribs. The brisket was moist, tender, with good smoke flavor altho lacked a good bark u get from smoking. Pulled pork was also tender and tasty. Baby backs were good but not showstoppers, again very tender but lacking in smoke flavor i thought. Beef ribs were the only \"disappointment\" as they were a bit fatty, slightly on tough side, but still certainly edible. For sides we got beans, loaded baker, and cole slaw - all excellent! We split between 3-4 of us and still had tons leftovers! Very good value IMO.  My wife got a market salad which she said was outstanding. Kiddos kids meals were also good!  All in all this was a great meal and experience that was on point in all phases! Great job guys! This place CARES and is TRYING to be good! Something you cant say about a lot of places these days. We will be back for sure!",

Too sweet of sauce drenched over chewy brisket, not spicy hot links, and average baby back ribs.  The corn doesn't taste fresh, the baked beans are overly sweet...running theme.  The cornbread is the exception of being good.  The brisket at Whole Foods down the road is better.  Don't know why these guys are in business other than the fact that American's as a whole like overly sweet food.  To compare it would be like going to a Chinese Restaurant and only ordering orange or sweet and sour chicken and saying this is great Chinese food.  It is the sweet and sour chicken of Bbq.  $60 down the drain.  Really it is Little Miss BBQ's fault for being closed on a Sunday.",

I also love that they have garlic roasted broccoli robb/brocolini. It's so good! The meals come with 2 pieces of cornbread, which is also fresh.  I usually sit at the bar and the staff are friendly and attentive. The last few times I went, they gave me complimentary mini donuts, which was a nice touch.  I'm so happy they are located within walking distance from where I live, but I'd make the drive for their food and dining experience!",

The bartender, Hayley was super friendly and adorable. I had the pulled pork sandwich with a loaded baked potato. Definitely some of the best pork I've had. They even give you cornbread to start which was fantastic as well. Not one, but two mangers came over to say hello to me and see if i needed anything.  I ended up taking some TOGO since the portions are very generous. I was surprised when she came back with some mini donuts for me to take with as well! This place definitely lives up to the hype. Can't wait to go back and check out the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "I've been living in Arizona for over 10 years now, and I've never been to the famous Bobby Q Peoria location. I've heard so many good things so I was ecstatic to find out that they opened a new location close to my house.   We were immediately sat down as they weren't busy at all (I'm sure that's about to change), and our server took longer than usual to acknowledge us. Because of this, the manager gave us two complimentary Q Rolls which were so good. They reminded me of Filipino lumpia except it had delicious brisket on the inside. They were crunchy and paired well with the side sauces. Our servers since then had been very attentive and the manager sat down to chat with us about the great quality of meat they have which was very apparent.   I split the two meat combo with my sister and for $23, it was well worth it. I had the prime brisket which was fatty and rich, and the beef ribs which were equally delicious. My boyfriend had the ribeye steak which he thought was amazing. We were served corn bread with butter and it was one of the best corn bread I have ever had. Little Miss BBQ is one of my favorite restaurants in the valley, so I couldn't help but compare both. Little Miss BBQ definitely has way better tasting barbecue sauce and fattier, tastier meats (which may overwhelm some people), while Bobby Q has an array of choices when it comes to meats and sides, not to mention better sides as well. I had the potato salad which was bomb, and the mac and cheese. You can definitely taste the smokiness in Bobby Q's meats. I can still confidently say that Little Miss BBQ still takes the cake when it comes to best barbecue in Arizona, but Bobby Q follows very, very close behind. I will definitely be back!",

The corn is roasted, buttery, and just heavenly! Had the bread pudding as dessert and it was perfect to top of my meal. The service was great. Our waitress was Nikole and she was amazing!

    "text": "9/26/2018 Yelp review Bobby-Q Scottsdale, AZ 3154 E Camelback Rd, Scottsdale, AZ 85016 ~ 10.3 mi (602) 626-8856  While the state of Arizona technically qualifies as a state located in the south, it isn't truly thought of as a \"southern state\" the way Virginia, Georgia and the Carolinas are. Maybe this is why these states are revered for their southern style barbecue and Arizona isn't even an afterthought for BBQ connoisseurs. Well, I'm here to tell you to put your preconceived notions about BBQ on hold and to step into the Arizona-based restaurant Bobby-Q to have your flavor palette rocked.  Although there is a well lit patio tastefully decorated with plants, few patrons were seated there when we arrived. This might be because of the fantastic interior design of the restaurant. Dimly lit by lamps on the lowest setting and candles flickering on tables makes for an endearing ambience to Bobby-Q that is perfect for   a classy family dinner, a casual business celebration, or in my case a dinner date with my girlfriend. Within a minute of walking into this fine establishment, we were greeted and being led to a table by our phenomenal host and server TJ. He gave us the option between choosing a table or a booth, a choice that isn't always presented in restaurants, but one we appreciated. We settled into a booth underneath a wooden ceiling fan that was rotating so slowly it was clearly an embodiment of the classic laidback southern charm rather than a cooling device. Very shortly after being seated, TJ was back with the waters we requested and a complimentary biscuit basket. He demonstrated a professional persona while balancing a kind and engaging attitude. When asked questions, TJ exhibited an excellent knowledge of the menu from memory and was able to make helpful suggestions without ever coming off as pushy. With his help, we were able to select two BBQ sandwiches with sides that we felt confident would pair nicely together while aligning with our personal preferences.   Shortly after finishing our biscuits, TJ brought the food out to us. The prompt and friendly service complimented by an exceptional meal. The meat had sauces slow cooked into it and was bursting with rich flavors that were complimented by the artisan buns that held our sandwiches together. The sides we had selected were reflective of True southern cooking, and enhanced our delicious BBQ sandwiches. The only qualm I had was the spicy BBQ sauce could have been spicer for me, but I enjoy much spicer food than the average person so that may have just been my perspective. The meal was one of the best barbecue themed ones I've had, but it was hard to finish for both of us as we got full halfway through. We weren't disappointed by this though, as it meant we would get to enjoy Bobby-Q round 2 for lunch leftovers the next day. When TJ came by to bring us our complimentary donuts post meal and make our leftover boxes, he asked if we wanted another round of biscuits for the road, which we happily accepted. The price estimate for Bobby-Q is denoted on google reviews with two dollar signs, a notation I feel is both accurate and fair for this restaurant. I would have even accepted paying more for the experience, as I was extremely impressed with both the food and the service. Overall, the entire Bobby-Q experience left me well fulfilled with my expectations exceeded. I know I'll be coming here for another date night in the future, and you should too.",

Dripping with grease.. we shared one of the half dozen and left the rest.. (we were never asked why).  Since they had just opened, we figured they were just finding their groove. We finally went back last Friday for happy hour.  Surprisingly, there was lot of open seating!  We went through 3 diffferent servers before we got one that said she was our official server and brought us water.i think her name was Krista.  She was an awesome and fun server!  Unfortunately, it did not take away from the extremely odd tasting meat. We tried the brisket tacos (meat was weird), machaca nachos (meat not terrible, but unusually uneventful and definitely not machaca) the wings were fairly good.. they dip them in pork juice (Krista had told us), glad she did..or I might not have been able to make out the non chicken flavor.. Margarita was ok.  I had two.  Both times asked for no salt and both times I got salt. The complimentary sugar donuts to take home is a nice touch..  we always try a happy hour at places first to determine if we would pay for a full priced meal.. unfortunately, (because we live across the street) we will not spend our money here again.. really wanted to love it.",

I live in LA and my Dad lives here but is new and not super familiar with the area yet, so we took a chance. Boy I am I glad we did! Showed up about 11pm and it was rather quiet but no biggie, it's Arizona in the summer ;) Our server was so rad...Joe from Jersey, and he was super sweet and genuine and made some great suggestions on the menu. After 10pm they have a limited but good and very reasonably priced menu...not sure if that's weekend only but it was fantastic. Food was great even for a late night eat and we walked away full and wicked happy. Really gotta to give it to our server though, Joe was a stand up dude and so accommodating....especially for it being later in the evening and being not very busy. Most late night places I've notice just want you in and out and want to go home. If you are in the area and are thinking of a place to go please check this out and ask for Joe!!",

Our table had two rounds of the hot, buttery cornbread....wow!!   The atmosphere is perfect.  Just big enough.   Highly recommend!!!",

    "text": "Wow!  What a disappointment!  2nd visit, so I guess we have to return one more time to see if it's good or bad!  This time the ribs were jumbo, mature and strong taste to them.  I brought half home but they weren't even good enough to eat today or ever.  The server might have been new and wasn't paying attention so she messed up on the drinks that took forever to get!  The Pour for the scotch was one of the smallest pours we've seen.  The wines per glass  are expensive considering the quality.  The cole slaw and the crisp shoestrings were excellent.  My husband thought the rotisserie chicken was average....no better than Costco!  People like the donuts.  I think they are just a ring of dough of pure fat.  So I give it a 3 star but really want to put in a 2 star!  We won't rush back.",

It can be hard some times trying new places (esp bbq restaurants) as I am a pescatarian but our waitress was great at giving recommendations for me! I had the vegetarian burger and Brussels sprouts (minus the bacon) and loved it! The vegetarian patty is made in house and seemed to be rice based. My boyfriend had the Q-Rolls and really enjoyed them! We both loved the cornbread as well. We enjoyed the overall experience and definitely will be coming back!",

That being said this place is pretty delicious...even for one with a palate lost on the art of the thing.  Generous servings.  We enjoy the sides.  Atmosphere is good.  Drinks likewise good and generous.",

    "text": "Absolutely recommend! We're in town for my brothers baseball tournament and decided to go somewhere for dinner and everyone said try Bobby Q! We made a reservation (do this or you'll be waiting a little bit more) we waited maybe 15 mins. My mom and I got drinks, me a long island iced tea (STRONG) and my mom a top shelf patron margarita(i think that was the name) and she had 2 but she said they were both good. Our servers name was Bryce and he was the best! Very patient and friendly, knew his stuff and was quick with everything considering how busy they were. I ended up getting the 2 rib plate with 2 sides i got grilled veggies (they were ok) and mac and cheese (very cheesy so if you like that its great!) my brother got the same and my mom got the ribeye which she loved! Their grilled mushrooms were AMAZING! Perfectly cooked o thought I was going to drool! I would eat here everyday if I could! The portions though are full sized and it gives you a lot of leftovers. We didnt get dessert because we were all too full, but the chocolate cake we saw looked amazing, they also give complimentary doughnuts at the end that are mouth watering! Thank you Bryce for a wonderful experience !",

I found out there were 2 deserts. I asked for a carrotcake to go. Instead of one of the employees hanging out help me, she tells me the bartender will take my order. So i sit for almost 10 minutes while the bartender is having a discussion while making drinks for people. So i take off but find the mansger on my way out. I tell her about my experience and how no one will take an order when the place is dead? The manager tells me there is a procedure there. Then she tells me to call in the order ahead of time next time. Sorry, no next time cause im sure you would still have your customers wait for 1 person with 5 standing and watching. Crazy bad service. I dont recommend",
