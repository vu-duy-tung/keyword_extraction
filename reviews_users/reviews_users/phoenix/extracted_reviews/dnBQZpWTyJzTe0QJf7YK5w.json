    "text": "I know there are tons and tons of new innovative burger joints in the Phoenix area. Harvey's Wineburgers never lets us down since 2009.  We continuously are never disappointed with the food or the service.  Freshly made burgers that are always thick and very, very juicy and the best burger by far, I think, here in town. The toppings to the burgers are always fresh.  No unripe or end tomatoes here. The bartenders and service have never disappointed us either. Mark is a great bartender!  He is always friendly.  Our favorite thing isnt even the burger, it's the onion rings!  I have always tried to figure out their sweet batter, but they are always perfect and a unique sweet flavor and freshly cut!  And yes, they are the best in town too!  They have several appetizers and other sandwiches that won't let you down.  What I love is its not  Scottsdale ridiculous prices for a burger.  So affordable that you dont have to worry about breaking your bank.  Dinner for two and a few pitchers of beers and shots and my wife's hard drinks, all for under $40.00.  You really can't beat that. Plenty of tvs, great music, and not a bad bar length if you like a bar to sit at and talk.",

After half an hour, our waitress offered us fries and apologized saying the food was \"taking longer than normal\". Once we got our burgers, we were underwhelmed. My burger was served on a cheap bun and my gal's patty was falling apart. We took our food to go and left. Maybe 10 minutes after we finished our food at home, my girlfriend was sick. Probably caught them on a bad day, but we probably won't be back.",

The chicken had a really nice crunchy outside and the inside was super juicy. My bf ordered the garlic parmesan patty melt. The patty's are all made with a little bit of red wine. I wasn't sure if I could taste the wine or not but it was delicious either way. The patty melt had a garlic parmesan sauce on it with bacon, onions, and grilled mushrooms. The mushrooms were strange. They had really good flavor but we're a little rubbery in texture. I wasn't really sure what that was about. However, eating the patty melt as a complete sandwich with everything in a bite was great! I felt like it tasted like it should sit really heavy in my stomach but it didn't and that was a nice surprise. They have food specials Monday through Friday and happy hour 3-6.",

Some guy had bought us shots before my friends boyfriend showed up and he continued to stare at us and whisper as the night went on. The old man playing the table next to us was very drunk and kind of aggressive, loud, and inconsiderate. He was constantly in our space. Just regular bar sleaze, would definitely take the food to go next time.",

Handmade juicy burgers chargrilled.  Toasted buns. Oh man.  Perfectly cooked fries. You get a boatload of fries/onion rings so order one basket because 3 of us shared.

I had to order the original for $7 and it was a good solid burger. Kept it simple with just grilled onions and watched the chef pour the signature wine, but you can't taste the wine.

Wrong answer. This is a bar. There are reasons why people visit bars. If that's what you are looking for, then this place would be fine, I think. Check the other reviews for that answer though.   B. Wrong answer. The wine hamburger was tasty and the fries hit the spot. The meat tasted fresh and mine was cooked through. I noticed pink in my hubby's meat (which is the way he likes his). I like mine well cooked, so I asked if when the burgers where ordered, if he had specified how we wanted the burgers cooked. The answer was no. Score. Unless I just couldn't see the color of my meat because of the lighting. Scary.  C. Correct. Sometimes when you are with a group of people, you just go with the flow, particularly when you are with people in their late 20s. However, when my husband and I were challenged to a game of pool at one of the two tables, the place scored some stars.",

We left an entire plate of uneaten wings, and nobody gave a shit.  Fine, no problem.    We finished our beers and left.  Even if the wings weren't trouty, they were way too big.

They do have a fun \"game room\" with a pool table and other bar games.  The menu is fairly limited to burgers, fries, and other traditional bar fare.  They also only have two beers on tap, Bud and Bud Light.    I ordered the 1/3 lb. wineburger and a side of fries.  The burger was tasty but nothing to rave about.  They served a generous portion of fries, which, like the burger, were good but not outstanding.  Surprisingly the service was excellent, which may be due to it being a slow night.  The server/bartender/cook was very attentive, asked about the burger, made sure I always had a drink, and even repositioned the TV so I can better watch a preseason game.    Overall, it was a good experience (3.5 stars if Yelp allowed halves).  The food is good (between quality fast-food and a trendy restaurant), the prices are more than reasonable, and the service was great.  If I go back, I would definitely try the 2/3 lb. burgers, which looked like a better choice.",

The whole cooking with wine concept may seem like a good idea, and it does make for a slightly interesting flavor, but I wouldn't call it good.  Aside from the wine flavor, the meat wasn't very good anyway, just like the other fixins and the fries.

Chad's report is correct, they have gone back to using the quality beef that kept them in business 40 years.  The sandwich is still a little smaller than the old days, but the burger is clearly hand made and absolutely delicious.  We are still debating whether you can taste the wine in the wine burger, that might require another visit or two.  They now offer a reasonably-priced lunch 'combo' that gives you great French fries (or their fabulous onion rings) with your burger in just enough quantity that you can finish them.  The table service is quick and as friendly as always. I will now put Harvey's back on my list of favorite (under $8) burger places in Phoenix.  Thank goodness for the new owners who have brought back tradition. You can't buy that \"homey\" feel elsewhere.",

It just looks kinda scary from the outside.  I mean I felt like once I walked in, the music would stop and everyone would look at me.  I climbed that mountain and finally visited with the BF last Friday.  We almost turned away because we didn't have cash on us, and didn't feel like hitting the ATM inside, I mean we got back in the car, talked for a second and then said what the heck!    Walked in to a tiny little place with a LONG bar!  There were probably 4 people at the bar, and 3 people in the game room playing pool.  They had the classic MLB game on, it was like Blue Jays and Astros, funny uniforms! It was maybe 2pm.  So the bartender says, What can I get for you?  My dumbazz says \"Can I see a menu\", this is where the music would have stopped.  WHOOPSY, there really isn't a menu, its kind of like a snack bar, where you look up, make your choice and its done.  Burger or Dog, Fries, Onion Rings or both!! DUH!  The bartender was nice though, I wanted draft the BF wanted bottle so he suggested I get a small pitcher, it's the cheapest way to go...SOLD! Don't have to pull my leg, thats for sure!    So, I ordered the cheeseburger, and the BF orders the gigantic chili burger, which was reduced to the smaller one by recommendation of the friendly bartender. BF sort of put up a fight, but the bartender assured him it would be plenty and if not, the next one was on him.  This turned out to be plenty for him, and I was thankful too, we had a long night ahead of us.  Much to our surprise, although I'm not sure what else we were thinking, bartender grabs a handful of meat slaps it on the flat top smooshes it down, and thus our burgers were born and cooking.  I mean, for real?  Man it was soo good, greasy yes, but everything a burger should be!  The last bite of course was the best, it had me looking for my other half, since I always cut those suckers in half.  I don't eat burgers often, but I can't wait to take my dad here, I might have finally found one place in town he's never been too.  While we were finishing up, a couple came in and sat next to us, who appeared to have just finished a golf game.  They ordered shots of Patron, I don't know how we got out without doing one with them.  The lady on the other side of us was getting her car washed next door so she said she comes in every time.  It was funny because the guy next to her, was hitting on her, and instead of asking her what she did for a living he asked her what her talents were!!  FUNNIEST thing ever!  Anyway, great place, great dive bar atmosphere!  Casual is as casual does.",

    "text": "OK so I went with Chris T. here and here is the thing. . . I have a rule when it comes to food establishments and this place does follow suite. Most often than not the little mom and pop shop hole in the wall. . (( and this place is what I consider a \"dive / hold in the wall\". . )) usually have really good food.   So here is my review. And I will have to break it down into categories.   ---------Environment:**** Here's the deal. If you enjoy tennis, chess, and polo. This \"aint\" your spot. If you are comfortable with wobbly tables, hard chairs the sound of beer bottles tossed into a trash can .  .then keep reading.   Harvey's Wineburger reminds me of Stag's Head bar. In case you don't remember that's the name of the place on Dukes of Hazard? Ok well the waitress was no where near the same looks as daisy but she had a mom and pop shop charm about her. Smiles and jokes were readily available. Chris T. and I were rather excited about possibly finding a new \"joint\" to hang out at and writing a good review. I ordered the Cheese Wineburger and Chris ordered the Super Cheese Wineburger. She mentioned something about the fries and onion rings because we would get more for cheaper or something. I didn't really hear but Chris said sure and that was good enough for me.    ---------The Wait: ---------**  As we walked in the door it we found a dark bar with a grill on the left. We sat our selves hoping someone would notice. There were a couple people in there that looked like regulars chatting away about something to the line cook and I think that is what our down fall was. The food was late and the waitress right off the bat apologized as she gave us our to-go bag as we requested after franticly watching the clock. She tossed in the drinks and fries for free because of the wait.  There was a long wait for the order. I believe it was the cool jibber-jabbin to the regulars that hung up the order.   ---------The Food: --------- *****  If it came only to the food I would give this review 5 stars. The burgers were stacked high like it was going for a photo-op.  I like my fries a little crispy and thought they were perfect. I'm not into soggy fries.   I have to make a comment on the other reviews. These are the ones about the lack of hygiene comments. This is referring to one night that they were extremely understaffed on a Friday night. I have to ask you if you ever worked in a restaurant.  I hate to tell you but that is more common than you think. Even when I worked in a 4 star restaurant at a resort. Ever watch Hells Kitchen.  .yeah. . Stick your finger in my food and see if the meat is done. . Thanks. .  I have to say I have not made a final thumb up or down. Next time I go there for lunch \"and I plan on going back\" I will call ahead and order. My only issue with this place was the wait for the food. The staff was friendly in a down home manner.  The food was really good, and my only issue was the wait.   ---------Over all score: --------- ****  look for another review at some point. I'm not firm on this. I will have to see if the time service issue is the same next time.   Until next time. . keep the groove and be cool.  .",

I along with my coworkers all ordered burgers and they didn't disappoint. While not the best burger I've ever had it was moist and delicious. Apparently the burgers are saturated in Burgundy while on the grill which gives them their flavor. Fries do not come with, which is always annoying, but we ordered a mix basket with onion rings and fries and it was quite tasty.   Only down note; halfway through the meal my coworker claimed he found a long hair in his burger that he swore up and down wasn't his. Being a self-proclaimed \"goat\", he ate the burger anyway. I know this would warrant an immediate look of disgust and a one star rating by some....but shit happens. Hair gets in burgers. I'll give the place the benefit of the doubt.   But if you are repulsed by such things, I would encourage you to come here anyway if only to have a drink, the place is pretty cool.  Oh and they do not accept credit cards, so bring some cash if you do not want to be charged a $2 fee from the ATM offered inside.",

    "text": "This is a GREAT place to come to hit rock bottom after a long night of drinking.The first time I wound up at this place I was already plastered and someone thought it was a good idea to pop in here for \"just one more\". It was fun because we were messing around in the game room adjacent to the bar and dining area. They have pool and shuffleboard and this VERY old retro bowling game with plastic pins. It really was good times. They have a good jukebox and we wound up slow dancing to \"Wonderful Tonight\" with the smell of rancid grease in the air right as it was last call.   Not quite as enjoyable when you're sober and/or it's still daylight.  I've been back a few times and each time have thought \"God, how did I end up back here???\" We actually came for food and drinks one time. Against my better judgement and because no one with me cared to intervene, I ordered a chili dog. Needless to say my intestines were doing gymnastics for the next two days trying get the horrid thing out of my system.  So I strongly advise against eating here. I am by no means a healthy eater but I think I've discovered my grease threshold here at Harvey's.   Much like a trip to Walmart at Christown, I always feel a desperate need to bathe after I visit Harvey's. The drinks here however are VERY cheap. If you're short on cash and just need to knock back one or two you'd probably be OK here.",

Like other reviews, it's 95% bar, 5% restaurant with a cheers type atmosphere.  Went on a Wednesday night and all the TVs were on a infomercial channel.  When I asked if they could put something else on, the middle aged Persian bartender told me that the cable was out and somehow we were stuck with a P90x drone .  Another flaw, the ventilation is so poor that you smell like you actually  fried the burgers on your stovetop.  Many better places in Phoenix",

We decided to go somewhere we haven't tried before that was off the beaten path. Enter Harvey's. Er, well, actually we did the entering.  We get into the place and it is a narrow bar with a line of tables to the right. We sit. We wait.  Finally, after much gab, the Waitress/Bartender comes up to our tables and says 'Hi' then proceeds to stare at us.  Anticipating the usual question 'Can I start you guys off with something to drink'  I order an RC cola and my buddy does the same.  She recommends the Cheeseburger so thats what we get.  I also ordered a mixed basket because (FOR SOME STRANGE REASON) fries aren't included with the burger! THIS IS AMERICA PEOPLE!!!!!  Along with the burger and fries, we got a lot of time to chat.  and I mean a LOT.  They sure are generous with time!!! Eventually, I ask her to put it in To Go containers and they give us the fries and cokes free.  Also, just a side note.  Please eat your food before coming on to Yelp and reading reviews about the food you are eating.  Some of these reviews almost made me vomit... almost.",

Even as we walked in, a bar fight was about to happen, but that just added to the experience, right along with the sticky tables and low lighting. The waitress/bartender was really nice and both my mother and I got the burger and fries with sodas. The cook came over and asked us if we were sure we didn't want any add-ons so we just told her to throw some mushrooms on mom's and bacon on mine. She was a proper hole-in-the-wall fry cook with big hair. If laws didn't prohibit it, I have no doubt she'd have a cigarrette hanging from her lips. The food was a surprise. While extremely greasy (you're getting a burger and fries so never expect less), it was also extremely delicious. Perfecly seared, thick-patty burger (with a unique tartness from the wine) on fresh bread with nice thick-cut bacon and great fries. It came with some onions and lettuce to top, also fresh.  A perfect example to never judge a book by its cover. There's a reason this place has won some \"best of\" awards.",

    "text": "Now accepts plastic!  Now accepts plastic!  Did you hear me?  Harvey's now accepts plastic!  I've lived around the corner from Harvey's for a little over 4 years now.  I had lunch there once in the mid 1990's, and went in to watch a Suns playoff game a few years back when my friend was decked out in Spurs gear and we were nearly lynched at Half Moon.  Quick lunch with a girlfriend who was in the mood for a burger about a year ago.    While I love, and I do mean LOVE a good dive bar, this place scared the crap out of me.  I'm young, not hideous, female, and not of the meth-head variety - so not only did I not blend, but I felt targeted.  Sad, really.  The ONE bar within easy drunk stumbling distance from my house, and I wasn't happy going there.  During a weekday for lunch was more or less okay.  But evenings are when the freaks come out.  And I don't mean the freaks like me.  I mean the dangerous crazy ones - not just the fun crazy ones.  There's a difference!  Well, enter the new roommate.  He was disinclined to believe my review, and insisted we go.  I resisted until late Saturday night, when he came home at 1am and insisted I get dressed so we could go there for an hour.  Maybe I was tired.  Maybe I needed a change of pace.  Whatever the reason, I gave in, got dressed and we walked over to Harvey's.  YAY!  According to Echo, the bartender (yes, it's her real name.  her parents are hippies like mine), the owner has been working hard to improve the place (read: clientele) for over a year.  It shows!    Echo is three shades of awesome - the perfect gal to be running the bar!  Easy smile, quick wit, great sense of humor and the talent to mix a great drink while cooking any of the grub from the menu.  She is a one woman show and pulls it off like a champ!  June drink specials included $2.00 Beam 5 Star bourbon, Yukon Jack, and I don't remember what else.  I asked for a bourbon and coke, the roommate asked for his bourbon neat.  (Brave - cheap bourbon *needs* to be cut with something!).  The pour is solid and consistent  Oh, and did I mention you can get a mixed drink, anytime day or night for just two bucks?  For $2!! Two drinks for me, two shots for him, a beer chaser for him and a cheese wineburger split between us.  Under $14!!  Holy hell, it's cheaper to drink here than it is at home!  And at home - we don't have the entertainment of the other patrons.  Like Cowboy who would do the splits on demand.  And suggest my roommate go through the needed steps for a game of \"rodeo\" with his girlfriend. You just can't make this up! Oh - and he bestowed slightly drunk me with a new nickname. Apparently, I am a \"prick ass bitch.\"  I don't know how he meant it, but I am taking it as a compliment and will wear it with pride!  Oh, yes.  I will certainly be back!  A LOT.",

It's not the \"scary\" or \"rough\" sort of joint,  I never feel even the slightest bit unsafe here, nor worried about my car outside.   If you're not into laughing, being positive and casual and openly social with everyone at a dive bar,    this place won't be good for you and you won't be good for it.      Take your negativity somewhere else.   At Harvey's you can look like you just rolled out of bed or dressed up,  whatever, doesn't matter.     All that matters is everyone's there to be happy,  be themselves,  be friends.      As for the food?     The burgers are unpretentious and have no real gimmicks,  you order a burger and it shows up and it's just an honest delicious  burger,  not too much salt or seasoning so you can taste the  meat, the lettuce, the onion for exactly what they are - PERFECT!    Update:  I invited my brother in law here,  and he refused because he says the wings are awful.    Well,  simple solution:  don't come here for wings.    It's Harvey's WineBURGER.     I'm not a wing person so I don't know first hand how their wings are.    Some other reviewers also said their wings suck so let's just go with that.",

They get points just based off that, a lot of places have stipulations to the \"check in\" discount.   On to the food, I got that wine cheeseburger it was amazing. I got my bread extra toasted. It was fresh and huge, it came with fries, all for $6. Definitely a win win.   I will be back for sure.",

We watch our Wineburgers get tossed onto the griddle, along with a giant pile of onions, getting slow cooked with wine while we sip on cheap beers in ice cold glasses.   Don't get the Super Delux Wineburger unless you're REALLY hungry. These burgers are hearty. Especially since they come with fries. And you know you're getting a drink or two. Onion rings are pretty alright, so get those if you're still hungry.  We came in on Friday night and got to watch the adorable cook dance and sing to Bruno Mars blasting on the jukebox. You should come for this alone. Such a great atmosphere. I'll definitely be back for happy hour or late night shenanigans.  Personal sidenote: I told my mom I came here and, like everything else I think I've had a first experience at, she very calmly informed me that I've already been when I was young. I love my parents. Bringing kids to bars since the 90s. No shame.",

Like i'm pretty sure my dad went here in college. Don't expect anything fancy - this is a dive with greasy \"bar food\"and cheap drinks. What is not to love?  We popped in here around 8:30p on a Thursday night and could not wait to try one of their famous burgers! I ordered the cheese Wineburger with American cheese and mushrooms. YUM doesn't even describe the goodness of this burger - it was super juicy and literally melted in my mouth. Not to mention, IT WAS HUGE anddddd....I ate it all! {#noshame}. It was under $10 and worth every penny. The best part, all of their Svedka vodka drinks were only $3!!! Yes, $3!! They even had cucumber! Um, yes please! They also have daily specials that are a steal - $6.50 for an entire meal, can't beat that! My husband and I walked out with 2 meals and 2 cocktails for under $25.   We left SUPER full and satisfied. It was just what the doctor ordered after a long day of traveling and delayed flights. The service was also very friendly. We'll be back again for sure!",

It's been here as long as I can remember and unfortunately this is my first stop. While Phoenix continues to grow there are a few oldie but goodie stops this one included. It's now made it to my top list of favorite places to eat.   Every night there is an amazingly priced special and where can you eat a meal for around $10 bucks!  First, I'd like to mention by no means am I a burger connoisseur. Truth is...I'm not into eating burgers but hands down this was the best patty melt I've had in a while! They went old school style with rye bread and this place actually makes burgers from fresh hamburger not some pre-made patty. I ordered my burger medium rare and it came exactly as such! Shoot, I can't even do that at home!   We arrived and only a few patrons saddled up to the bar. It seemed like they all knew each other, a bit of an eclectic non-pretentious group. There were a few pool tables and a small dinning area. The bartender/server greeted us immediately and within a few minutes got us our drink order.   Shortly after we arrived the place filled up and without hesitation the bartender was doing loops around the entire place without skipping a beat. Made my head spin really just watching her. Big kudos to her and to the cook!   Everyone must go at least to try the patty melt if nothing these! And if you want to catch a game, there are enough TVs to go around for about 1 per person - no kidding!   Cheers!",

And the service was so spotty, it became irrelevant by the time I could have asked for it. The husband got a wine cheeseburger and I got their version of a patty melt with bacon and parm sauce.... My burger was pretty not awesome. The bottom piece of bread was soggy with grease. The bacon was thin. The cheese didn't taste like cheese..... Tasted processed. Overall, the burger was super disappointing and left a slick of grease in my mouth. The fries, however, were awesome. Perfectly fried and crispy. The husband's burger was better than mine. It was a pretty standard burger. I feel like there are better places to get burgers in the valley that cost the same or less.",

Some of the best burgers I've ever had, though they removed my favorite from the menu (oh please bring back the saucy burger, I need that A1 laddled bacon covered deliciousness in my life).   They have two pool tables and a machine to despense quarters, and you can order from either the bar or from the billiards side and they'll even deliver to your table. Their drink prices are a bit higher than other dives near by and their burger prices are a bit steep but for $10 you are getting a huge burger! And definitely try their garlic sauce, it goes great on everything.  Perfect casual place to bring a friend visiting from out of town or coworkers after a long shift, it does get quite busy and there's no smoking patio but ample parking and I've never had a problem finding a seat. Their pool tables aren't emaculate but their cues are in good repair and they have many to choose from. They even do a Sunday pool league. They also offer a burger of the day from their menu so you can save a few bucks by coming in on your favorite's day!  The clientele range from the usual rowdy day drinkers to more hipster PBR fans but everyone has always been friendly and talkative.",

    "text": "Know what you're in for when you walk in and sit down. Here's what Harvey's has going for it:  I'm a big fan of their food, especially the Patty Melt. I've also had their burgers and chicken strips and, although it's nothing groundbreaking and innovative, it's better than a lot of places that try to get fancy with it. It's a classic for a reason, leave it the hell alone.  The drinks are also awesome. Prices are about what you'd expect and are pretty decently discounted during happy hour and for their daily specials. I don't even know what they are off the top of my head, but that's what the internets are for, figure it out yourself, I'm not on the take.  Ultimately though, the reason I frequent this place and continue to go back is because it's chill, the staff is super friendly, and the patrons are generally not a loud, jackass-ish sort of crowd. Want to stop by for a drink with a few friends after work and not have to deal with a bunch of bullshit? Harvey's is for you. Also and maybe it's because I suffered through Scottsdale bars for a year (I'm not rich and/or good looking), but the staff has always seemed... normal. Yeah they're at work, but they'll shoot the shit with you and laugh at a stupid joke and sometimes offer one of their own. It's almost like this place is run by humans instead of booze dispensing automatons.  Oh and pool tables and darts are there too if you're into that sort of thing.",

This burger had more flavor than any that I have ever tasted in my entire life.  I had the garlic patty melt, with a side of onion rings.  The patty melt included this amazing garlic parmesan sauce, along with the crispiest bacon I have seen.  The only potential drawback to their burgers is that they are so juicy that they are messy and soak through the bun.  However, that does not matter to me because the flavor was unreal.  My only regret is that I have lived in Phoenix for 13 years and this was the first time I visited. Needless to say, this will not be the last. This has now become my go-to restaurant that I will be taking out of town visiters to.",

We all ordered cheese burgers and we all thought they were out of this world.  Who could ask for more... Great service... Great food... And great prices...  We will definitely be back soon and highly recommend to all.  . Thank you !",

First thing I want to highlight is the dart board. It looks brand new and works like a champ. Best one I've thrown at in awhile. Second, the happy hour doesn't sound great (50 cents off), but because the drinks are already so cheap it's a great deal. As for food we ordered a cheeseburger + green chili. The burger was juicy and good. The chili was canned chili and mild so nothing special. We also tried the sampler platter. The chicken strips were actually really good, the jalapeno bottle caps were salty, and the mozzarella sticks were pretty straight forward. We enjoyed our visit and will be back.",

I came in today and the woman cooking the burgers is as slow as can be - more interested in visiting with her buddies at the bar about personal stuff than actually doing her job and making some burgers. The drink tasted like an airline drink, not the usual quality that I have come to know. Seems like they are resting on their laurels and depending on increased business from new apartments and not providing the quality service, food and drink I've come to know. It's very disappointing.",

It was clean inside but had that old bar feel. The service is not terrible but it wasnt the best either. One of the burgers was undercooked which the cook happily no questions asked cooked another one for us. Kudos to the cook.  The fries were good and went amazing with the burger. It was priced decently as well. You would spend just as much if you went to Jack In The Box but you would get a fresher and better burger.  I could only eat half the burger and I was full. The meat was great, nothing bad to say there. Its not a must to stop in, but if your a stickler for a thick juicy burger, this may fill that void!",

It is like a small single lane bowling alley right in the bar and it is the great bar game ever.

Only thing I would change is maybe turn down the volume on the music a bit (especially when the pop music gets a bit out of control) and fix the thermostat so its consistent and not extreme in both rooms. Those two things fixed and it would easily be 5 stars.  2. My favorite burger in town  UHMAZING WINEBURGERS. I didn't even know wineburgers existed until I moved here. Thank god I moved here. Now, keep in context what this place is and is not. It's not a gourmet burger joint. It's not extremely creative burgers with the best there is in ingredients. IT IS a dang amazing, done right every time burger. Nothing flashy, nothing fancy, just good eats. Not to mention, when they run out of burgers (which happens) the rest of the menu is well worth checking out.  3. Pool tables  Fun past time and offers a little activity while slinging beers and noming the night away. Just a past-time I personally enjoy. :)  4. Fantastic staff  Friendly, yet not fake. They'll have a good laugh with you and banter. They know what they're doing and the service is good.",

His daughter ran it for another five years (about) but decided running a dive bar wasn't what she wanted to do with her life and put it up for sale.  It was bought by a Vietnamese couple who upgraded the interior.  They added a bunch of big flat screen TVs, started taking credit cards.  The place used to be cash only, although they did put in an ATM a couple years back.  Harvey's signature was the wineburger, hand formed from quality beef.  Always excellent,  But the new owners switched out for preformed patties of cheaper meat.  That was a spoiler for me.  And apparently not only me.  The last time I went there under those owners I was the only one there.  I wonder why they couldn't figure out where their crowd had gone.  I ordered a hot dog.  But apparently those owners dumped the place as a loser (said the bartender).  I went there last week.  Whomever bought it brought back the first class meat (98%) with fresh, hand made patties.  It's back on my recommended list.  What other people say about the ambiance is True.  It =is= a dive bar.  I mean that in the best sense.  Cheap drinks, a friendly crowd (many of whom seem to be regulars; they know each other).",

It was the best. I got onion rings and cheese sticks. The onion rings are battered not floured and the cheese sticks were just okay for $8, but $10 for the best burger I've had...I'll be back! Plus they're open late!!!! My new spot!!!! I wish I could have shown you a picture, but the dang thing was gone before I could even think about it! :-)",

    "text": "The first time I came here it was really good. I got a burger because that's what they're known for and it was delicious. Maybe being a little tipsy might have something to do with it.  My boyfriend hated the place. He hated the food and hated the server. She wasn't attentive at all. The wings were chewy,  which means they deep fried frozen wings. I tried to tell him he was being very critical.        The next time I went there, I was there with a friend and sans boyfriend. After a bit of drinking I decided it was time to go home. Earlier I convinced my boyfriend to give them another chance in the food department and picked us up some food to-go, burgers because they were so good. I live within walking distance from the place and when I got home, i noticed the burgers were practically raw. I called the bar and told them what happened, and they ask me to come back so they could replace my food. My boyfriend wanted no part of that, and wanted a refund for his food. After the bartender assured me that my food will be cooked properly I came in and picked up my replacement food. He was also good enough to refund me a couple of my drinks from earlie which made up for the hassle. That burger he cooked himself and it was good. He also took the lady who made my burger off the grill.      Today I went there and picked up some food to go. The same lady who cooked my burger before, was working the grill. I didn't want to be a dick and ask for someone else to cook it and I decided to give her another chance. Before I left the bar, I checked my burger to make sure it was cooked all the way, and again it was raw. So I asked the server to have her cook it a little longer, and when I got home it was ok but then my fries were cold. All in all, it's a pain in the ass to try to get food cooked properly there. If you like rare hamburgers, this will be the place for you.",

The Central Corridor of Phoenix has no shortage of bars for game watching and bar food, but this one probably has the most relaxed, casual neighborhood \"old bar\" look and feel in the area. I walked in and ordered a cheeseburger, onion rings, and beer; the folks at the bar were very friendly and accommodating. I sat down at one of the small tables in the pool table area because it was more quiet there and it was easier to view the game on the screens in that room. The burger was very good - juicy, well-seasoned, cooked exactly as I ordered it; and the onion rings were the best I've had in the city ... I have to remember to ask for two orders next time! I had a pretty good time and had only two things to grouse about: it took a long time to get my food, and the Chiefs lost the game.",

Harvey's has a cool, dive bar type feel with the added bonus of a kitchen that grills up burgers.  We got 2 cheese wineburgers (cooked medium rare) with pepper jack cheese, jalapenos and a side of fries. Burgers were juicy, fries were crispy, and it was exactly what we needed to satiate our late night bellies.   Pro Tip: kitchen is open until 1pm, so if you're hungry get in before the kitchen shuts down for the night!    There were also tv's displayed around so we watched some games on the screen, and there looked like there was a pool table on the other side of the bar, so we'll be checking that out next time.  I'll definitely be coming back to Harvey's next time I'm looking for some late night grub!",

When the order came I noticed that the Swiss cheese was processed cheese and the mushrooms came from a can. Couldn't even eat it.  I finished off my beer and waited approximately 30 minutes for the waitress to come back and she never did. Finally one of my friends went to the bar to get me another beer. The table next to me was served 5 more rounds of beer without our several tables being checked on or cleaned up. Had to go to the bar to pay my tab and then I left.",

Harvey's is great. 2. Glorified divey bar. (Glorified because they're not fully divey since they have some sazerac whiskeys on their back bar along with other good spirits but still has that divey feel. It's aaaaaaawesome) 3. Ask for Mark. He's awesome. 4. Once you've asked for Mark, ask Mark about the garlic parmesan mixed with buffalo sauce wings that are to die for. 5. Order the garlic patty melt. 6.

PBR holds a special place in my heart, from my college days and I don't care if you make fun of me, I actually like the way it tastes. You can get a tall boy for like 2 dollars at Harvey's.   I also really enjoy the food, they have weekly burger deals-which are worth it. I've had the classic wine burger-with cheese, the patty melt, and the chicken one. Don't get the chicken one, it isn't very good. I think it's just on the menu to have that option, but it tastes bland and like it came from frozen.   The good news is, the other burgers are pretty spot on. I love the patty melt, it's open goey glory. The wine burger is flavourful and moist. The fries are pretty good too. I will say, there has been some inconsistency, it depends who is cooking. The guy with the beard does a great job. For the price though, and the excellent divey atmosphere, this place is   I went here and waited 1:30 minutes for my food. We asked for water 3 times and never got them. This is terrible.

    "text": "I had the pleasure of eating here last night. I ordered the Deluxe burger cooked medium rare and I will say it was probably one of the best burgers I have had in a while. I ordered it medium rare and the party was huge and they cooked it just right. At first I was hesitant of eating here because it reminded me of a old broken down strip club, but I'm glad I ate here because I will be going there again. The service is amazing and the ppl there are very welcoming. One thing I did notice is that when I ordered my burger I added mushrooms on it. When they brought my burger out they had placed the melted cheese on top of the mushrooms so that the mushrooms wouldn't fall out after the first bite. Not a lot of places do this and I thought it was thoughtful and surprised. Oh more more thing. They have been open since 1958! WOW!!!",

The chicken sandwich with american, bacon, grilled jalapenos, lettuce, tomato, little ketchup and loads of Tabasco.  I haven't had anything else in months, but everything there is good.  Get your car washed next door while you eat (same owners).  Tip if you like to chow down, take the paper out of the basket and put it directly on the table.  That way you have more room to construct and get to work.  See you there!",

After dinner I asked him if he'd come back and he surprisingly said yes (he's a picky eater).

It's the one place I would go in public wearing Uggs.   Sometimes I just want to go somewhere where the real alcoholics hang out, or as I like to call it: judge free zones.   If you are a lady and are relatively attractive (ok, if you are a lady), someone is going to buy you a drink. Maybe even several drinks. Sometimes that is nice. Sometimes that is creepy. You get both kinds at Harvey's. Get what I am saying? I carry a knife/wine bottle opener and some mace for protection when I come to this joint. Not kidding. Once I couldn't find my little wine bottle doohickey, so I brought an actual kitchen knife. You just never know.  Yes, my friends think I am weird.   Back to Harvey's. I only have one gripe to pick. The new jukebox. Songs are sometimes a dollar. One song ... one whole dollar. What are you, iTunes? Give me back the old jukebox where songs were 25 cents.  Also, I don't care what anyone says. Harvey's burgers are freakin' awesome. Sometimes I crave them and then feel sorry for myself.",

    "text": "Last night I was feeling low on disposable moolah$ and fiercely craving a REAL hamburger. There was a place in the 'hood I was dying to try...and guess I'll continue dying because they were closed. *sigh* So I had my adorable better half whip out his Yelp app (yes, he actually whipped it out, it was epic!) and looked for other burgeries in the area. Since I was already heading up 16th Street, we made a beeline for Harvey's (one of those places we had driven past thousands of times, looked at interestingly, and continued on our merry way without stopping).   I'm happy we stopped in. I *heart* dive bars w/ good food...and this is the diviest one I've been to in forever  (and yes, that includes my escapade to the Brass Rail last weekend).   The Bears vs Cowgirls game was playing, the joint had about 6 other people enjoying cold ones, and we sat at the bar. After what seemed like FOREVER, the bahtendah came over and took our order and gave us a couple of menus. There isn't much on the menu. There doesn't have to be, from what I can tell. I ordered a cheesewineburger w/ onion rings, and my schnookums ordered a cheesewineburger w/ fries.  I'm not a huge fan of fries...but these were scrumptious and crispy and thin. The onion rings were so good, (crispy outside, soft onions inside) it felt like they were actually melting in my mouth. The burger absolute perfection, from the soft bun and juicy meat to the fresh lettuce, tomato and onion adorning it. I added ketchup and mustard to mine and it was simply heavenly.   The bartenders are friendly without being annoying/hover-y...in fact, you may need to flag one down if you want another drink, but it was exactly what I was looking for and I will definitely stumble my way back there again instead of always driving by.  Next time I think I'll try the wings.",

Whether that makes sense or not if you ever drive south on 16th street just south of Camelback you will see a small dive bar that says Harvey's. This place makes one feel like you got off a DeLorean when you walk in with that old 70's feel.  The wooden panels, the old Budweiser signs and yes that cheers like feel with regulars.   They have good drink specials like 2 dollar Pbr's but if you are like me and need a quick lunch bite, come in for a burger.  They only have about 3 burgers and they are cheese, regular and I believe a double.  They are delicious and taste like a good homemade burger.   They have happy hour weekly and on weekends but weekends they go a tad longer. The 6 dollar burger with fries and a drink is my bag.",

    "text": "If I ever want to be reminded what kind of asshole I am, I just need to reread this review and I'll know.   Why is this the review that will serve as this reminder when I have so many Yelps explaining so much about that already? Well:  I went here on an anthropological adventure. I'd heard the regulars were noteworthy in a Bikinesque fashion. That they're scary and funny and local and Cheersish... And that everything takes forever. And that everything is average but that it's the combination of the preceding factors that make this place worthy of one adventure to see how the other half live in their natural habitat.  We walked in and were IMMEDIATELY, like within seconds, greeted by a drunken song. A man and a song and a twinkle in his eye and I was immediately charmed.   I was expecting it to smell very strong, especially since they sell cigarettes in the vending machines, but really there was no noteworthy odor.   The bartender was high or drunk. If she was not high or drunk, she's spent so much time in her life being either high or drunk that she now gives off a permadrunkenhigh vibe. For instance, she takes our drink orders and says, \"Want menus?\" and then walks away and re-asks us our order, which was a pitcher of beer. And then does not ever bring menus. Glazed eyes. I don't give a fuck ethos.   AMF is on the menu, which I had to be reminded stands for adios mother fucker, which is just basically telling the drinker that this particular night will not be one they should bother trying to remember. Here, I could make some grand (albeit stupid) statement about how this is exactly the type of place people come to forget, but I don't think that's True considering I was the only one drinking them.   The one gentleman we interacted with was so desperately lonely that he clung to every vestige of a chance of an opportunity to insert himself in our convo and I felt deep sympathy for him.   All and all, I can't see any reason to ever go back but I'm glad I went and that it exists. It serves a need. It serves a population. It offers an opportunity for snobby a-holes to have a place to go on \"anthropological journeys.\"   Apparently, they put wine in their burgers if you're into that...",

Very fortunately for my belly and overall happiness, I work real close to HW.   Rockin' beer, truly fantastic food, and delightfully divey decor--what more could you ask for? Truly, the wineburgers are phenomenal. My  weakness is the patty melt (pro tip: this baby's on special for $6.50 on Thursdays!), which is cooked to utter perfection and honestly might be the best patty melt I've ever had in my life. Also, french fries are my reason for living, and they've got exceptional fries here. A severe ranch addict, I deeply appreciate that they've got personal ranch ramekins of really great ranch (which I'm generally pretty picky about).   Don't even give it a second thought. Walk into Harvey's, bask in the dingy darkness, order yourself a patty melt and a pitcher of Rolling Rock, and experience the perfect Thursday evening.",

I knew what I was getting into because A) I've been to the original wineburger at 19th ave and Bethany Home already, B) I've read the reviews and C) I knew that these two places were originally started by a pair of brothers many years ago.  Walking in, its a real divey type place.  Wood paneling on the walls, simple no frill tables and chairs, with limited decorations and dimly lit.  It's set up exactly like its sister location the original wineburger, with half of it being a bar with chairs and tables, and the other half being a pool and congregating area for those that want to do more then sit and hang on the bar.  I also saw a pinball machine, which was pretty cool as well.  They have a few TV's hanging from the walls behind the bar with a variety of sporting events on for you to watch. Granted, I'm not a huge sports fan, but it's better then staring off into space or what not.  I sat at the bar, since I felt more comfortable there, and there wasn't to many people in here, so there was more then enough seating for me. I felt really comfortable here, and didn't feel like being around a million people anyways.  They have great beer and alcohol specials during happy hour, and they have a decent menu of items to choose from. Prices are great, and the bartender here was really super cool.  Him and I chatted throughout my meal and I really enjoyed the conversation.  I went with the Jumbo Hot dog, and it was tasty...charbroiled and all, I really liked it here.  If you want a low key night out, go check this place out. Divey, dark and not half bad. Will be back in the future. I think I like it here better then I did at the original one.",

While many were positive, way too many were so negative that I almost decided not to go. It was only after reading them in order from oldest to newest that I could see what was happening. In a nutshell at one time Harvey's Wineburger was a great little bar with excellent cheap food. Then the owner died and the place went down the toilet (kind of literally), then someone else bought it and it got a little better and then it was recently sold again. So do  yourself a favor and save the time I spent by ignoring all reviews (positive and negative) from before 2014 and only read the one's that apply to the place AS IT IS TODAY because whatever used to be before now is meaningless to you, the former restaurant is gone, it's in the past and should just be forgotten.  We walked in and looked around and discovered that yes it looks like something from the set of \"Cheers\". Bravo! I will never understand people who choose to go to a classic dive knowing that it's a classic dive, decide to stay and eat/drink, then go home and write a 1-star review because it was a classic dive. When they drove up in their Bentley and walked in with their snooty Beverly Hills attitude they weren't smart enough to figure out based on the neighborhood and look of the building that this is an old neighborhood dive bar? And they're so proud of their ignorance that they proclaim it publically in a review?  Wow!  So, personally, I loved the \"look\" or lack of it. The place is divided into 3 sections, a dining area to the right (with a pot belly stove) which is separated by a half-wall from a long western-style bar, which is separated by a full wall from the noisier and more boisterous pool tables and other gaming gear.  There was a group of about a dozen customers at the bar who had been drinking and were loud and another dozen or so at the pool tables who we couldn't hear because of the solid wall. I'm sure this would have outraged Mr & Mrs Bentley from Beverly Hills - to think of it! The nerve of those people drinking and making noise in a bar!!!  We seated ourselves and a really friendly young bartender immediately came over to greet us. We decided to get into the spirit of the place and have $2 PBR's in tall cans and to try the original Harvey Wineburger with the $2 add-on side of onion rings and fries. As we waited we noticed the 3 brand-new 70\" TV's on the wall and that the speaker in the dining room was playing some loud music. Not annoyingly loud ... bar loud. I can just hear Mr & Mrs Bentley freaking out that a bar was playing music instead of serenading them with a strolling violinist.  We didn't have to notice the TV's for long because the burgers were brought to us in less than 15 minutes. Yes, I know, the string of McDonald's franchises Mr & Mrs Bentley own serves their burgers in less than 5 minutes. How RUDE to make a customer wait 15 minutes for a burger that's hand-formed and actually cooked instead of microwaved.  Both the bartender and a waitress came over numerous times to ask how we were doing. Both of them extremely nice and friendly. The customers at the bar were also pleasant, not at all like some people have described them. Oh, and as more people arrived to eat, the management was courteous enough to shut the music off in the dining room and leave it on only in the game room.  So, bottom line, how was the food? Well, there are a few things that are consistent in my reviews. One is that I love a real hamburger made by real people in a mom & pop dive. Two is that I don't believe it is possible to call any restaurant's food the best as in \"best hamburger\" or \"best pizza\" or anything like that. The variety and differences you find at local mom & pops are what make exploring and experimenting fun. That being said, Harvey's Wineburger ranks as one of the best burgers I've tasted anywhere. Adding the wine gives it a truly unique flavor. The condiments are simple and you add them yourself ... ketchup, mustard, onion, lettuce, tomato, pickle and mayonnaise. The burger patty is obviously hand-formed, thick and cooked perfectly well-done. The bun is nothing special, which is good because it doesn't take away from the flavor of the meat.  Now, compare that to the \"best burger\" lists you see in newspapers and on the internet. They are always accompanied by photos of a 3' high burger with crap on it that no one can even pronounce that no mouth ever made could wrap around it, and priced at $25 for a freakin' burger. Not for me! I like my burgers honest and Harvey's Wineburger serves one of the most honest there is.  So, when you add it all up it's 5-stars for the quality of the food, the friendliness of the service, the promptness, the value, the honest hominess ... everything works unless, that is, you go in with a Beverly Hills attitude. In that case you'll hate it.",

At first glance it looks like a dive... But closer examination reveals the place is actually really clean and has a lot of character. The burgers are the best I've had in recent memory.  I usually don't like burgers unless they're really good.  Chuck box and Portillos are two I like.  This place tops them both!

AND! if all that wasn't enough to make this the greatest bar ever, they also have twilight zone pinball, which is THE BEST PINBALL GAME OF ALL TIME. we have won so many free games on that thing. everyone probably gets weirded out because we play pinball wizard by the who on the jukebox while we play.  except one negative. whenever monty (awesome) isn't working, some other cracked out babe works and she always closes the damn place at like 1, which is SO annoying (we're talking fridays and saturdays here--monty stays open til at least 2 even on tuesdays). and she always forgets our change and orders and everything else, really. and makes us feel like we're cracked out just by watching her.  basically, just go when monty is working (he looks like the guy painted on the wall next to the smoking area).",

    "text": "BURGERS. Prob the one food item I'd want with me if I were on a deserted island. My heart lies with the Apple Pan burger in LA, but this place is def a top 5 winner.  Don't bother sitting at a table, its kinda awkward. Just post up on the bar and enjoy what's about to come. I eat my burgers plain. Just cheese, meat, and bun. Call me crazy, but when you add all those condiments it just takes away from the flavor of what you're actually going for. Now an In & Out burger on the other hand...bring all that goodness. Anyways, back to Harvey's. Go with the regular cheeseburger, the \"super\" (really just two patties stuck together) doesn't grab the wine as well and loses it's unique flavor. Keep an eye on the cook, it's pretty interesting the amount of wine (pretty sure it's burgundy) actually poured onto the grill and repeatedly on the burger, and one last douse before it's swept up off the grill. The taste...amazing. Melts in your mouth and with such a distinct flavor...you'll be back. Super juicy and oh so gooey with cheese. I think I saw a \"special\" seasoning in the back (aka looked like \"Lawry's Seasoned Salt\") but maybe not. Guess we'll never know.  I gave it 4 stars and not 5 because, one it's not the best I've had, and two their fries suck. Onion rings are a better option.They need to step up their fry game immediately  if they want to hang with the best of them. But other than that I can't complain. Tried the chili cheese fries, which I'm not a big fan of anyway, and wasn't impressed. LA's Carney's on Sunset prob wins that award.  And so you know...it's a hole in the wall. Not that that's bad, but don't be expecting a restaurant. We had quite the interesting conversations with others sitting at the bar. Pretty intense, but you can prob get away with keeping your eyes on your food and your company. Classic Bud Light neons all around, juke box, super dark, old school video games...yup that kind of spot. Again...no big prob with it.  All in all, I give Harvey's top billing for making a unique cheeseburger and one that I consider to be one of the best I've ever had. It's 110% worth trying to give yourself something to consider next time you're dreaming about meat, cheese, and buns...Oh wait...is that only me???",

The cheeseburger is decent - standard bun, lettuce, tomato, pickles, and cheese (no onion for me, thanks)... but little flavor.  My lunch companion said she tasted the flavor of the red wine but I couldn't.  The fries were surprisingly good, and the basket was enough to feed at least three people.  My iced tea was strangely bland, watered down, and sour, but not entirely unpleasant.  Our waitress was really good, though - attentive, friendly, and all-around pleasant.  Another important thing to note is they are a cash-only establishment.  They do have an ATM, though.  I don't think I'll ever find myself craving a burger from Wineburger, but if I find myself around 16th St. & Camelback without any other options, I'll likely stop in for a quick bite.",

The wineburger and fries are great and they will cook it to order, and they hit medium for me everytime.  The place has the same great divey feel it always has and other than the TV's and new bar top (I liked the old warn out fake wood formica one myself) nothing has changed, and that is good.  Great pricing on food and drinks although I wish they had more than Bud and Bud light on tap.  A bit of concern with the latest ownership.  We came in one day at 11:30 and an older guy, I assume the new owner, without a smile asked what we wanted.  We told him two beers and he went outside to bring the cook back in from a smoke break to get them?  You own a bar and you can't pop two tops and ring them in?  Sure hope you get a clue on how to run a bar now that you own one.  My only other concern is the blonde bartender that acts like you are in the way of whatever it is she does there besides work.  When I ask for my check I don't ever want somebody to shout down the bar $38, I want to see it myself, people make mistakes.  Then to find out it was only $36.16 and she charged us .50 for the cranberry juice in a couple of cape cods we had for \"dessert\" really didn't sit well with me.  Always a great place for a burger, fries, a beer, and local color.",

Personally, I prefer Monty, he is a sarcastic fifty-something Midwesterner who cooks one of the best burgers I have ever had (sorry, better than Polly), mixes a mean Manhattan, tells awesome stories and will simultaneously insult you, shake your hand and discount your drink.  When the bowling game is functional it promotes awesomely competitive tournaments and if you take over the jukebox the moment you arrive you create your own ambience.  Bring a friend, split the Super Wineburger with Cheese and an order of Chicken Fingers, leave happy.  Wash, Rinse, Repeat as desired. The only reason I would consider bumping it down a star is that I am normally a devout beer drinker and they only have Budweiser and something (I believe coors) light on draft.

I visited this location during previous and current ownership. I've eaten, over the years, 30+ Wineburgers.  Of the 30+, I think two -- TWO -- tasted of wine. And those two were so good, I ate another 28 or so chasing that delicious, phantom Wineburger  Two weeks ago I visited again and the expression, \"too much shuffling if the dishes for the fewness of the food\" comes to mind. All that fucking around and I ended up with a burger no better than Carl's Jr.   This visit the heavily-inked cook, apparently trying to save money, chintzed on the wine so the flavor -- what flavor? -- was especially muted.   Never had a chance of tasting like wine.  I know the two that I had that were delicious were doused, smothered in wine.  That's not my opinion, that's my experience.    I you hit just 2/30, that equals a .066 batting average. The freaking Mendoza Line is .200 which is, a) bad enough to get tossed from the league, and b) 3X better than .066. You go try your luck.

I have had the opportunity to go there over 20 years ago as well  as a few time over the years and yesterday went there with my girlfriend. We had a craving for a good drink and burger. We were not disappointed. Especially my girlfriend who is vey picky about everything. They even made her Long Island Iced Tea to her liking, which is a fete in itself.  We started off with the jalapeno caps which was good. I had a cheeseburger and fries. She had the same but with onion rings. They were both perfect! Despite one girl working the tables and bar service was perfect. Cook brought our food out and was very polite and entertaining.  Look with all these high end burger places and bars out there they do not compare with this place. It is that simple. I have had crap food and service all over this valley. This was a pleasant experience. A nice Saturday afternoon lunch and drinks with no bs.  I will be going back when I have my burger craving again.",

It took 40 minutes until just the patty melt came out. About 10 minutes later the wings came out. The bartender never really checked on us until it was well over 30 minutes nor apologized for the food being late. Up until the food issues I thought I'd come back but when it took that long and the food was mediocre we won't be returning.",

If you're a wine enthusiast, they dont have a wine list for you, and the only wine being used is pretty much a splash of wine vinegar on the patty while its on the grill.   On to the burger, the valley is full of fantastic burgers. Burgers that are simple, delicious, affordable bites, all the way to decadant, creative, thoughtfully sourced, pricey experiences. And this one isnt anywhere near the top.   The beer list is simple, nothing really adventurous, but thats fine for a dive. Because Harvey's is a dive, and that is actually what it's best at.  It's a no frills, simple, open late & have yourself a drink & a bite kind of place.  Maybe it's my fault for wanting more.",

The joint we were at did not have food so we decided to look for a bar with food and found this place.  The place was pretty packed but we were able to get seats at the bar. The bartenders were great, really friendly. The only thing that kinda sucked was the wait time for our burgers. I totally get they were busy, but I was definitely getting a little hangry.   The burger itself was was delicious and cooked just the way I like it. I will definitely be coming here again in the near future. I'm not a fan of larger crowds, so I'll try to avoid a Friday night.",

    "text": "Bottom line: Hip hop dive bar that's just an average dive bar and serves average food. Mark learned my name and that was cool..  I have yet to experience the perfect meal and I've eaten here many times. I really do not like the musical selections but if you're into hip- hop, you'll enjoy.  Meal 1: onion rings and wine burger ordered medium. It was a perfectly cooked burger and she remembered I asked for no tomatoes. The onion rings were not to my liking and kinda bland and heavy although she did fry them well to ensure they were very crispy.  Meal 2:chicken wings extra crispy and fries cooked exactly right on the wings. Only a few were soggy toward the end. Not the best attempt at crispy wings I've been served, but it was up there. However something was inedible. The fries were crispy but terribly over seasoned and I couldn't eat them.  Meal#3: Leo is now the cook. My burger was over cooked (completely cooked through-not medium) but the bacon was crispy and the fries seasoned perfectly. Leo did not remember \"no tomato\". He made a lot if errors in the kitchen while I was there.  Also I saw how they handle when an order is made incorrectly... they scrape off the incorrect ingredient and serve it anyway. Wrong table served... just e-serve. Ugh. I hate when restaurants are lazy and don't own up to mistakes and explain why an order was re-cooked. If I didn't like onions, I would find the hint if them repulsive in a re-served burger.  Meal 4 and final meal: again ordered burger medium with fries. I told Leo that last time my burger was over cooked and I wanted it medium no tomato. When he served it with tomato he took it back, removed the tomato and served me the same lettuce, onion, pickle. The burger was way well done. The fries were undercooked and starchy. Terrible meal. I mentioned this to Leo and he said said something to the effect that it wasn't like that when he pulled it off the grill? WTF?   Prices are cheaper than most sports bars for a burger and fries, but I want it cooked right and am willing to pay more for that.  You can't cook and I'm out. Don't make excuses, make it right somehow. It's inappropriate to have BURGER in your name and not be able to cook one.",

Not too greasy burger in a well toasted bun that really comes together in a wonderful way. The fries are seasoned and tasty as well. Over all the food here is as good as everyone says it is.   The atmosphere is classic bar vibe with a pool table in back. It's not upscale or trying to hard. This place knows what it is and does it's job well. I heartily endorse Harvey's Wine Burger. Go here.

    "text": "I have been wanting to try this place for a while once I realized that it was actually still in business and not an abandoned building. My friend told me they had great burgers and I was like damn that place is open.  Than I figured I would give it a shot because I love a great burger and supporting local independent businesses.      The cheeseburger was great.  It looked like the standard size is 1/3 lb.  It had a great char on the outside and nice and juicy on the inside.  I got the mixed basket of fries and onion rings which is enough for 2.  If you read some of my previous reviews you know I don't like to share fries so you know this was a big size of fries and onion rings.  Another great thing is that it was inexpensive $5 for the cheeseburger, $4 for the hamburger and $4 for the rings and fries.    If you watch Diners, Drive-ins and Dives on the Food Network they would refer to this place as a Dive and I think the people their would not mind.  The entrance was a metal door that didn't even have a door knob.  It was really dark on the inside and like most places in central Phoenix it was a small space.  It took about five minutes to get someone to notice us.  Once we got the attention of the waitress she was apologetic and seemed very nice.  The booths were really small and seemed to be made by someone who got a C in shop class.  The funny thing is about half way through our meal my girlfriend and I noticed that it was an about a 99% AARP crowd, even the employees.  I guess only the cool Gen X and Y know of the place.    I will definitely be back again and again!!!    P.S. BRING CASH BECAUSE THEY DON'T TAKE CREDIT CARDS!!!!!!",

    "text": "Running errands near Camelback a few Fridays ago, I found myself STARVING, yet having several more stops on my itinerary. The Yelp application on my iPhone (insert shameless plug here) showed that Harvey's was right around the corner, and with a swing of the wheel, I was pulling up to their dilapidated storefront.   Being alone, I bellied up to the bar, which was packed at 2:00 PM on a Friday. I still had work to get done that afternoon, so I had to stick with an RC Cola (yes, you read that correctly.....RC Cola). Let me just tell you that I was the only person in the place that didn't have a beer in hand. Happy hour (and the weekend, apparently) had arrived early at Harvey's.   Just a quick moment on the very eclectic crowd that filled this place. On my left were two appliance repairmen. On my right was a gentlemen that was pushing 80. At the pool tables were a group of what looked like college kids. Their common bond was the beer they were all putting away. I immediately made plans to return on a coming Friday afternoon, with friends in tow, and be a part of this very diverse, day drinking crowd.   Now, onto the food, which is why I stopped by in the first place. I wasn't sure what a \"wineburger\" is and I can't fully say that, even now, I understand. All I know is that I ordered their standard wineburger and that it was grilled fresh for me, right at the bar.   The burger took about 15 minutes to cook and I could pretty much watch them prepare it. The same person that took my order (and delivered beers to all my fellow patrons) prepped and cooked the burger. It was fresh ground meet, pressed into a patty and they regularly pressed it into the grill with her spatula. Ultimately, it was served up on a fresh bun, which crisp lettuce, onions pickles, and melting cheese.   Let me tell you that this burger was FRESH. Grease was still dripping off the sides of it. There were cracks in the edge of the burger, where they had been pressing it down into the grill. I actually had to wait a couple of minutes to eat it, as it was still TOO hot. I'm not sure of where you're going to go and get a burger that is cooked that fresh, right in front of you, and then immediately handed to you. Probably one of the freshest hamburgers that I've ever had prepared (in which I wasn't actually grilling it myself).   The onion rings were straight out of the boiling oil and too hot to eat. (I'm sure my doctor does not approve of this meal). All the condiments I could ask for were delivered promptly. The burger was hot, with just the right amount of grease, and full of flavor. This was as close to home-made as you can get.",

The price is right, there is ample parking and the staff are friendly.  The jukebox is a great deal.  I dare you to put a 5 in this eclectic machine.  Your selections will be playing long after you leave.  I would not ever recommend Harvey's if you are on a time constraint.  This a place outside of time for you to hang back in when you have the time to hang.  It's laid back, sit down and let the bartender know you are there.  Everything else will take care of itself.",

    "text": "I have read the reviews on here, and decided to chime in.  First off, I like Harvey's.  Do I go to Harvey's all the time?  Nope.  But I enjoy the burgers and the simplicity of the place.  I have probably been there 15 times over the past 3 years, so this is a culmination of all of those meals.  Everyone talks about the decor (or lack thereof).  The inside of the place is DARK (especially when compared to most places in Phoenix).  When you leave the place during the day, make sure you have sunglasses.  After your eyes spend so much time adjusting to the lack of lighting, the sun feels like inmates coming out of solitary confinement for a month.  While the decor gets 0 stars from the Zagat type crowd, I find some sort of enjoyment with how beat down it is.  In fact, if they spruced it up, I probably wouldn't like it as much.  It is a True dive bar.  The service isn't great, but it isn't what I would call bad.  It isn't like they screw everything up, but it is a bit slow.  If you are in a hurry to eat (like most Americans on lunch hour), then maybe you should go to McDonald's across the street.  Finally, the burgers.  They are great.  Quality meat, good cheese, and plenty of char.  I never found the food unsanitary, but I have also been to Brazil, so the food here is always more sanitary.  I am not a fan of the fries (got to Delux, Gordon Biersch, or Cafe Bink if you want truly great fries), but the onion rings are good (not as good as Ted's Hot Dogs, though).  I love the fact that they have RC Cola.  I have only had drinks there 1 time.  They make them stiff, and will impair your judgement quickly if you aren't careful.  They have a heavier hand in pouring than most college bars.  Overall, I recommend it if you like dingy bars and a good burger.  Sure, there are better burgers in town, but this is pretty unique.  A little more seasoning could be used, but it isn't bad the way it is.",

I'm no rookie to the local hole-in-the-wall restaurant, so it didn't bother me so much. I ordered the normal Harvey Burger. The bartender/cook/probaby owner or something, pulled out the patties (which had been marinating in red wine and garlic, yum) and slaps em on the flat top grill. He then squirts on even more red wine as the burgers are cooking. I don't recall the price, but it wasn't too bad. Overall, great burger.",

The well liquor is rather bad, so I guess that makes the happy hour prices fair $2.50 for well drinks & $2 for beer.   They serve food but I didn't try anything. Overheard they were having some cooler problems so I decided to pass. Most of what is on the menu will set you back about $8 bucks. But I saw that their burgers are hand formed not the frozen pressed blocks of beef so they might be as good as some people report.  They have really nice TVs and a few of them if you wish to watch something.   But even though I want to like the place for being a dive bar steps from Camelback Road and holding on, truth is I have been to better dive bars with better menus and well drinks.

She was cooking, bartending, handling money, scratching her head, shaking hands, cleaning bar tops, running dishes, etc.... did I mention she did not wash her hands once during this whole time? We ate our dinners, disgustedly, thinking how an inspector would shut the place down immediately if they saw it. She was entertaining, all over the place, yelling, throwing things, etc. I'm pretty nieve, and didn't know until my buddy told me that she was on meth at that time. So there we have it, a restaurant I thought would be a new favorite with a methead bartender that doesn't observe any food safety laws or regulations.  I'll be getting my hepititis c test next week.

It tastes like a burger that someone cooked in their backyard, but not nesc. in a good way.",

    "text": "The menus are greasy. The burgers are greasy. They only take cash.  Real cheese. They'll let you drink the cooking wine if you ask nicely/persistently. The beer is cheap. Good soda syrup/carbonation ratio.  Monty is A W E S O M E.  Sleazy, sad, and mostly dark.   The bottom line here is that this place predates your Delux burgers, Fatburgers, Vig uptown or downtown, or bougie artisan pizza joint by possibly a thousand years. Alas, this is True Phoenix- the Phoenix that existed when we were acres of orange groves, palm trees, peacocks, canals, and farmland. Way back when Phoenix was modestly larger than Palm Springs and a burger was a burger.   And if the state of affairs at Harvey's bothers you, well, then it may be time to look inward my friend. :)",
