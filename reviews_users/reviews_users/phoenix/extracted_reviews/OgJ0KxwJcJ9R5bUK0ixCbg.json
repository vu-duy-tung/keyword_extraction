I can safely say I've never been treated like that before! I'm sorry there was loud music and I couldn't hear, and I'm sorry you had to roll your eyes at me and raise your voice just a little bit louder. Seemed like an intentional rudeness too..maybe it's just me? Mac and cheese is good though.",

It was also slow so maybe the pressure to keep the line moving plays a role in the attitude. That aside, the man that helped me was very nice, and so was the woman (red-haired, cool arm tattoo, nice look to go with the shop vibe). Two thumbs up guys :) I will be back and may explore your food options. There are so many and I would ask questions all day, so I will look at a menu.   P.S. Thanks for the pineapple-ginseng tea recommendation! Delicious B-)",

Was told, \"sorry, we'll have to look for it and we'll call you.\" Meanwhile we had paid for all the shirts already. We asked for some documentation that we paid for all the shirts, but one was missing. They were unable to do that and clerk was rude.  They found shirt and called to pick up which I did. When I arrived, different clerk barely said hello, handed me the shirt, when I said thank you, no response. Very rude overall, will not use them again. They send all their shirts outside, risk of losing a shirt is higher than most. Mistakes happen and we would have understood if they had been apologetic and accommodating. All we asked was something saying we had paid for all shirts but received one less.  Never using them again.",

Everyone generally nice and you can overhear some crazy conversations. Smoking permitted outside. Has a full bar, in-house snacks and meals. Also has a full bar. All types of people come through.  It gets busy most nights (or at least nights I've been there) and the only bad thing about it is that there isn't enough seating!",

If you like over roasted coffee that's worse than Starbucks (and that's hard to do) this might be the place for you.  Service was very unfriendly.  Apple almond Pastry was super dry and barely had any apple or almond flavors, and I got an immediate headache right after consuming it.  Barf!!! Seriously I thought I was being poisoned!",

Their bartenders are also super friendly and will pretty much whip up any cocktail you ask for, they aim to please!",

The reason this place is SO crowded ALL the time is because they're doing EVERYTHING right!  Their food is delicious, their drinks are delicious, their pastries are delicious, their bar is VERY well stocked, their service is outstanding, their ambiance is electric, their brand is SOLID... If not for having to park half a mile down the street then elbow my way through a teaming mass of hipster humanity, LUX could be my everyday go-to.  In all seriousness, if you haven't been here before, you need to check it out. It's the ultimate coffee bar, which is saying a lot since the Phoenix area is host to a whole lot of those (with more sprouting up every day, it seems).  One of my favorite things about LUX is that, despite the constant surge of customers, everyone who works here always seems to ENJOY working here. Honestly, I don't know that I've ever had such consistently positive service anywhere else.  I can't recommend LUX highly enough. And truth be told, there ARE in-between hours where the rush dies down and you actually CAN find a spot to park at with your computer for a while and take it all in. So give it a whirl - you won't be disappointed.",

Although the coffee was good, the donut was more memorable. It was a sugar and cinnamon donut, but what set it apart was it's use of salt in the dusting mixture. I loved the contrast that the salt brought to the sweetness of the sugar and cinnamon.  I've been here a few times at varying hours but probably wouldn't recommend it as the type of coffee shops you go to study at, because it's always packed and loud.   Other than it always being too crowded I really like this place and would go back, especially for their pastries!",

We rolled in at around 8pm and this place was busy but not overwhelming. I thought it was just the size of a Starbucks but we kept on walking...and walking... turned the corner...and walked some more! It's huge! To me, it felt like a fusion of a hipster bar like Harvard & Stone in LA and a boutique coffee shop like Urth Cafe, also in LA.  Choices for lattes, coffees, and teas were aplenty, dessert spread was to drool for, and hot diggity, they serve dinner too! AMAZING! I can hang out here all day and night and wouldn't need a reason to leave. And I really mean that because I can grab dinner then stroll over for a drink at the bar! Excellent...

    "text": "This review is specifically for the mac-n-cheese with jalapenos and bacon. It deserves its own review.  Every time I come to Lux, I glance past the mac-n-cheese. I mean, how exciting can American restaurant mac-n-cheese be? A customer sitting next to me at the bar ordered up a bowl. It looked pretty enticing. He asked if I ever had it before. I said no, and he looks me straight in the eyes and says \"you gotta do it.\" By the tone of his voice, the mac-n-cheese must have been an experience.  So tonight I did it, but instead it done me...oh it done me. It done me good.  Beatles fans, holla if you hear me!  I learned to make proper \"macaroni pie\" from a West Indian friend. You slow-cook milk, cheese, onion, a bit of flour, salt, and pepper into a delicious, aromatic cheesy creamy white soup. Then you pour al-dente elbow pasta into a baking dish. Then you pour the creamy cheese soup deliciousness over the pasta. Then you layer shredded cheese on top and bake it all together. That's how you get tender, creamy mac-n-cheese. Lux knows the deal, and they took it up a notch by throwing jalapeno peppers and bacon into the mix.  As a baked mac-n-cheese chef trained under a West Indian macaroni pie sensei, I tip my hat to you, Lux. Well done.  Edited: A tip for Ms. Andrea O. Being a pleasant customer goes a long way. Being not-a-mega-bizatch works wonders for getting good service. It works for me. You may want to try it sometime. If you suffer from perma-scowl, you could draw a smiley face on a paper bag and place it over your head.",

    "text": "*here is the review you had deleted , I stick by it*  yes this place has good coffee, but what a bunch of rude pompous asses. I am just saying I am az born and raised from a hardworking family and back round . When I come into an establishment the last thing I need is for some trust fund hipster know it all to twitch his (or her) handle bar mustache at me with an equally annoying hipster stank eye, when I order my (in their opinion ) shitty cup of coffee. Sorry if i did not hash tag an over price thrift store shirt on my twitter , or order my special decoder ring from some homeless want to be spoiled brat to get the latest cool memo from the wonderful lux asshole cafe . But here is just a few tips that might get you a few stars   1. after you argue with me over an extra shot not being a good idea in your wonderful cup of coffee, dont include yourself in my conversation when I finally get to enjoy it . Just to correct me on a subject in a condescending tone that I am actually quite knowledgable about due to heritage and experience .  2. dont give me shit looks and long sighs when I come to the counter .  3.dont correct my opinion of coffee I actually have taken barista courses so maybe you can dip into your hedge fund and go to a couple yourself before you blabber your opinions all over my good day.  4. dont smack your lips and tell the person behind you in a shit sniffing tone mocking my order.   5. believe it or not before you found your dream job as a barista and wasted all your parents money on a art degree, remember I have worked my ass off to just enjoy one simple cup of coffee with an extra shot , in a fun decorated establishment with a shitty leaf scribble across the foam. So if you gave two shits about the extra dollars I would so eagerly throw into your tip jar, shut the fuck up smile and just say yes would you like anything else? and talk shit about me at the end of your shift like the rest of us.",

It was very busy, but no one was cleaning off tables where someone had finished eating. Just too unsanitary for me.",

    "text": "Awkward set up that is messy and unorganized. It's one of those places where you are not sure what to do or where to stand or where to get your food and coffee - and they don't care. They are trying so hard to be hipster and cool that they forgot about customer service. They just need to re-think they way they operate, and I think they would rock, since the coffee is very good. The food is just average, however. My biggest complaint is that there is one dark haired short girl that works there that just seems out of it and rude. She does't look at you when you order, and then end up making you repeat yourself several times. Also - she's not very polite. Maybe I just wasn't hipster enough for her.   I think most people go here b/c of the hype and to scope out others... If you don't feel like getting looked up and down while you drink your coffee, don't go here. Lola or Urban Beans are much better.",

    "text": "I am very adventurous and I often stop in to check places out first, so I am glad I read the Yelp reviews before I did or I never would have found the place. Sure, you can see the sign out by the road, but the sign announces three separate businesses and there is no discernible entrance. You have to park in the back lot and walk in from the rear. There is no sign above the door. I wouldn't have found it if I hadn't known to look for it, and if I hadn't been brave enough to blindly walk into an unmarked business. You could park on the side, right where you pull in off of Central Avenue, but know that you must go in at the middle point where the two buildings meet, and it feels like a back-door entrance. You must be cool enough to know how to get in the place. (joking).  The menus are shit. Meaning, you really have to look around hard to find the menus--it's not like there is a big wall menu above the counter, which is how it SHOULD be. It makes it tough for people in line to decide what they want, because everyone is craning their necks around everyone else in line just to read the posted menu. It is TERRIBLE. So they should improve on that. However, that being said, the bakery items on display look fab, and to taste them is divine. I wound up grabbing a box of pastries and a coffee to go. Best scones EVER, and worth $3 a piece because they're big.  My Americano was not that good--it tasted like it was made from instant coffee. But at $3 it was big and it was hot and it was coffee. That was okay for me, but I probably will not order that there again. It looks like they have lots of much more interesting choices to choose from, and if I had more time I would have tried something other than my old stand-by.  The food menu exists...you have to use bifocals. But look for it because the lunch and breakfast entrees look WONDERFUL. The seating looks more conducive to coffee and cocktail drinking. There is a big long table inside that looks like you can eat a meal at it. It is community style dining. There are tables in back, and tables outside that look like you can eat comfortably there.  I have to point out that it is the most hipster/pretentious place EVER but in a good way. If you feel uncomfortable being judged by the hipster group, don't go. It is a really cool place and I plan on taking my sister there. She'll love it. My kids would hate it, but they are teenagers and think they're  too cool to be seen there, if that makes any sense. I loved it but in a fishbowl kind of way. I am not that cool, but I liked looking. What will get me back there is THE FOOD!  Oh, and the people are VERY FRIENDLY! :) ...which is always a plus.",

It tastes like a piece of red velvet cake *Their homemade whip cream! *drools* *Their assortment of baked goods *Their salads and lunch foods *So many different places to sit inside and cozy up  Cons: *Staff- this is where they lose points for me. I have only encountered maybe 2 friendly people who work here. there is one gal in particular who REALLY needs to freshen up on her customer service skills. I mean really... It's scary how unfriendly she is.  *The fact that you basically have to beg them to put whip cream on your drink. I'm sure a lot of people don't even know they have whip cream. They keep it in this hidden container in their fridge and they skimp on it big time - depending on who is working *If you're not hipster, you are going to stick out like a sore thumb. I usually come in my work out attire and people typically look at me like I have just sprouted an extra head. It's quite comical *They stop serving breakfast at a certain time (I can never remember what time) but they keep the breakfast menu up all day and when you ask for something from the breakfast menu, one of the suuuuper friendly (sarcasm) baristas will bark at you that breakfast is over.. Which you are then forced to go back and look at the small food menu that is printed on a piece of paper and all of the hipsters who are in line get super annoyed at you. I'm sorry I'm not a regular who comes 5 times a week, I guess I don't know the protocol?!!  Anyways, I continue to come for 2 reasons.. The amazing coffee and the fact that it is middle meeting ground for my best friend and I.  If you go, and you're not hipster, just make sure you are prepared for their snobby attitudes and you will be just fine ;)",

    "text": "On Saturday, October 18, my fiancee wanted to do something nice for me after pneumonia had confined me in bed for nearly two weeks. After looking up a few reviews, she decided to try Lux, a cafe I had visited a few times in the past. Excited to get out, I agreed to go and looked forward to breakfast, which did nothing more than disappoint me.  My fiancee and I parked the car on the street and walked into the building to find a disappointingly long line. As we got closer, it became apparent that only one register serviced the entire line. While some employees did come out to ask what drinks they could get started, we still felt the line could have been decreased had another register been added. I ordered orange juice and biscuits and gravy, and my fiancee ordered orange juice, a Danish pancake, and a side of bacon.  We ordered our food and searched for a place to sit. After another long wait, our order finally came up. The pancake and the biscuits and gravy presented themselves well on the counter; however, the bacon did not appear anywhere. Thus, I asked one of the cooks about the bacon, to which she answered coldly that the meal did not come with bacon. Considering this cook might have misunderstood me, I clarified that my fiancee had ordered a side of bacon. When given a second opportunity, most people generally take advantage to correct a mistake. Instead, this cook callously answered that no bacon was on the ticket and went back to work.   At this point, I returned to my fiancee and asked her for the receipt, as I had perhaps misheard her order. She did not have it, so we both returned to the ridiculously long line and went directly to the cashier. The cashier commented that the computer system is horrible, did a few things on it, reprinted a receipt, and handed us some kind of card. Not having received an explanation, I asked what the card was, and she explained that it was a $15 gift card. She further explained that the side of bacon would be ready shortly. We finished out meal and discussed how disappointing the experience was.  I have decided never to return to Lux because this company does share the same values as I do. Most of the staff seemed very slow moving, despite a long line and long wait times for meals. In addition, the dis-service offered from the cook does not instill trust in me for the person making my food. The disorganization and rudeness of employees turns me off, and I would rather give my business to companies that offer friendly, prompt service, such as Starbucks or even Dunkin' Donuts. While you may be a local business, that alone does not entitle you to my business, especially when you offer sub-par service with a lack of systems and courteous staff. I would rather stay confined to my bed for another two weeks than subject myself to this poor excuse of service again. All in all, we had to wait in a long line, fight several times to get the food we had ordered and paid for, and be treated horribly all before noon on a Saturday.",

My favorite part is the decor and ambiance; I love the old little vintage plates they use and the mason jars full of iced coffee while you sit with a friend in big puffy pink chairs. This place is the best. Thank you lux never change",

What was amazing was the Coffee Cake I tried. Crunchy on top, yet creamy in the middle. with just enough cinnamon to not overpower the other flavors.  Based on that alone, plus the ambiance and the crowd I'm awarding it a 4th star.  The coffee needs a lot of work, though. A shame, given that this should be their shining star",

Or that hole in the ground from Silence of the Lambs? Remember that,? Where he put the Senator's daughter. Anywho... this place is just plain terrible. If you're standing in line plan on getting knocked around by rude busboys carrying tubs of dirty dishes. God forbid if you ask a question about the menu. You can hear the eye roll 2 blocks away. I've never seen such a rude staff from jump street. Did you ever see that Pop Copy sketch on Chappelle Show? This place is like that.  But for the life of me l don't understand that patio. It's like a redneck's back yard. Giant wooden spools for tables and the crappiest furniture. I mean seriously,  I've seen nicer patios at 35th Ave and Rosier. That patio is the saddest thing I've ever seen, and l volunteer at a children's hospital.",

Lux doesn't make it by hand. it comes out of a box. even starbucks \"only\" charges 60. - for some reason, you and everyone else in line to order wait in the exact middle of all the foot traffic in the cafe (???) and the menu (a standard-size sheet of paper taped to a glass wall among other non-menu sheets of paper) is easy to miss.  - even after the morning rush, the inside of the restaurant is always packed and dimly lit, making the space unpleasantly loud and claustrophobic. - all the food i've ever eaten at Lux has been middling at best. the croissants and pastries are nothing special tending toward flavorless, same for the plain bread/toast, avocado toast was unseasoned (ie. no salt)  the ugly: - staff are rude, condescending, aloof. holding up the loooong line to have conversations with customers (wtf dude, c'mon), being disdainfully told to \"read the menu\" then \"just order a side of veggies\" when asking about meatless options... ohhkayyee, thanks. based on the reviews of other yelpers, Lux is clearly aware of the problem and have done nothing to discipline or train employees. no it's cool i actually want to be talked down to by 22-year-olds who all seem to follow the same instagram makeup tutorials and shop in the same urban outfitters.",

The second we walked in we were greeted by a line almost out the door, can't blame them with such great variety of pastries.   Had a difficult time making up my mind on what to get since everything looked amazing, staff happily assisted me on how to order and gave me great recommendations of their liking.   Pastries were so superb that we stayed for lunch as we were curious to see what the food was like.   Even ended up taking some road snacks, I rarely say this but believe me everything here was amazing.  I really enjoyed the fact that they had a DJ inside lol   Get the vegan donuts!

I've indulged in both their yummy coffee and cocktails cause I'm indecisive - and if you like options this is the place for you! You can just come and people watch, watch sports in their large projector in one of the many rooms (which I didn't know existed till my bathroom search turned into an adventure). Alternatively,you can just put on headphones get work done and enjoy the great vibes. Definitely recommend checking it out. It gets quite busy too",

I went to Lux with my ex BF because it was close and easy but I always just wanted to bail as soon as we got our drinks. It didn't help that some lady who worked there never wore a bra and always made a point of going up to talk to my other half while ignoring me. Nothing says customer service quite like free range boobs hugging on your significant other while people wearing flannel hang out typing on laptops and silently judging the non hipsters. Parking sucks. Coffee and baked stuff are mediocre. Food is way overpriced and they definitely think it's more original than it really is. Lame.",

Their decor was a mix of simple, modern with a vintage twist, I loved it! The workers were very outgoing and friendly which is always a big plus. It was hard to find seats because it was super packed but I'm not complaining.  The noise level was pretty loud so I didn't understand how people were studying here. It seems more like a place for social outings. All in all, I enjoyed my experience at Lux.",

I am not sure how many times I have stopped in Lux over the past few weeks for a cup of coffee and a breakfast sandwich.  This Friday was the first time I noticed the bottle of Tito's and next to it a bottle of Hendrick's.....  This place has a bar?  Oh, gosh, they do!  Well damn!  Oh, I never envisioned myself as a hipster hanging out there eating at the the huge tables with my laptop on their free wifi or in one of the comfy chairs reading a book, but I see a book, comfy chair and cocktail in my future!

Their pre-made pastries and coffee were decent, but their dutch pancakes (savory and sweet) and mac and cheese really stole the show for me.  The mac and cheese was creamy and buttery, and their savory pancakes (toppings varied by ingredient availability) had a nice smokey flavor to it. I really enjoyed the food and look forward to trying out other items on their menu.   Concerning their atmosphere and setting, I was a bit overwhelmed by the layout of this place as a first-timer since their kitchen/work area are separated into different locations (bar area, kitchen, cashier, etc.). While I appreciate the modernity and transparency of the set up (seeing workers as they went back and forth through the \"customer area\"), it can be a bit difficult navigating where things are during the first visit.",

Try it on a cappuccino or just get a glob on the side. You'll be addicted in no time.  The made-to-order food is also delicious - great place for eggs.

Bookings was kind enough to provide a list of hotels for me to rebook, The problem was that all of the choices were substantially more costly than my original reservation. When I called Bookings, I was assured that I could book any choice, and they would assure that the Helmsley would make up the difference. I rebooked and after my vacation, I called Booking to find out when I would be repaid. They said to wait, and would call back.

Usually Lux is busy, so good luck finding a seat. The atmosphere inside is great. Local art on their walls is constantly rotating. There are tons of electrical outlets which encourages using their free wifi!  If you go during lunch time do not miss out on stopping next door at Pane Bianco for some of the best sandwiches in Phoenix.  Lux's pastries are good and they offer a verity of specialty bottled drinks. If you're a fan of iced tea try it with mango syrup - it's wonderful and not very many coffee shops I've been to have the mango syrup. It is my personal favorite. Also I love their soy velvet (a soy white mocha). Their smallest size is much smaller than average coffee shops - probably 8 ozs. But it's great if that's what you're looking for. All their lattes come with two shots of espresso, so you're only paying for more milk and syrup when you upsize, so buy according to how much you enjoy the flavor of espresso.   Their drink prices may seem a little high, but they're worth it. Plus their menu is elegantly designed. Tax is included on the prices listed, which features price points either on the dollar or fifty cent. Purely simple!",

The bloody mary was my favorite late saturday drink, it was spicy and perfect. I give four stars instead of five because of the heartbreaking horrible pastries. A pastry should taste delicious and colorful and beautiful. Fuck the fat and sugar....it is a PASTRY folks. The pastries here taste like a bowl of plain oatmeal. Anyway, other than that this place is awesome.",

    "text": "Okay, I want to give this place three and a half stars. I really wanted to like Lux based on the reviews, but there are things that prevent me from rating it higher.   #1 - I once wondered where all the hipsters roamed in Phoenix. Then I went to Lux and I wondered no more. Pretty much everyone had an apple laptop here. Me and my vaio were the odd ones out. This is just an observation and has not a lot to do with the overall rating.   #2 - It was crazy crowded in the middle of a weekday. The place itself isn't that big, so I assume there's a big following (confirmed by the number of reviews for this place). This made it difficult to lay my things out and have adequate study space.   #3 - Smaller space + people = really narrow walk ways when people are standing in line to order.  #4 - Coffee is good, but not as strong as I personally like.   With that said, the perks here are ambiance (fun art on the walls that I imagine are changed everyone once in awhile), good people watching, parking despite the amount of people here, and the fact that its by the light rail.   So yep, Lux is a solid coffee spot, but I think I'll keep looking for the coffee shop of my dreams.. with table space and stronger coffee.",

I like it.....reminds me of some of the haunts in downtowns of Portland, Seattle and SF. Sandra K had a lovely latte (Sandra K is an artist, so it's the first thing she notices is how it looks). Second comment was \"It could use another shot\". I stuck with a $2.00 cup of coffee and an elegant slice of Quiche. 3 Cheese and Garlic that looked as good as it tasted. The crust was perfect...this crust could hold anything, Banana Creme, Lemon Curd, or Chocolate Pie, that it contained a garlicky Quiche was fun.  Like the communal tables...hip guy next to me inquired about my journal and that inspired a light and friendly conversation. Lux is demonstrating that we can have a downtown (mid town here) identity. This is great a great addition to our city and I am proud to say that I am a Lux fan.  All the best to the \"Luxorians\"",

As a people, us Urbanites are not generally prone to, well, waiting-- but these guys tamp out a mean cup that's just THAT good.    I live in Tempe and work in CenPho (@ Practical Art & Sack's Cafe), so I'm usually blipping in and out before work at the end of my commute, but I covet those few hours a week I can sneak away from everything, nestle up in a chic designer chair, and click away on my laptop (which--- outlets galore!-- I can actually plug in!).  On occaision, finding space to perch my bum can be a bit dodgy, and when it's chilly out their ample outdoor seating just isn't all that enticing-- but the times when I've been completely stymied have been few and far between.    I'm sort of a plain Jane and generally just order a non-fat latte (don't ruin their great, roasted on-site coffee with a syrup!) from their friendly, knowledgeable staff. And I have to say, I love the tattoos, piercings, and mod-indie clothes sported by some of the staff-- makes me feel right at home!   Last rave-- they support local artists & sustainable practices. I heart them.",

I work out of coffee shops and despite what some of these other folks say they observe I actually get more work done here than most other shops. I think the loudness and business of the place does it for me. Kind of like working out of the eXtreme Bean in Tempe.  Any way, no other shop makes a white mocha (velvet) like Lux. Do yourself a favor and order a regular velvet mocha for here with their fresh homemade espresso whipped cream. Additionally, all of the pastries you see there are freshly baked in house too.  So good.",

But don't get me wrong, I love me some Lux.   Soy latte with a blob of whipped cream and fun patterns in the foam? Love it. Velvet latte with a blob of whipped cream and fun patterns in the foam? Love it. Croissant bread pudding with a blob of whipped cream to spoon into the fun patterns in the foam? Love it.  People watching, alterna-hip vibing, Macbook-ing...Lux is the place to be for yummy fancy coffee and surrounding yourself with people who wonder, \"Are you genuine?\" (I was glad to see they finally changed that little message)  Here's a fun game my husband and I played the first time we went there (on a chilly chilly day): watch all the people coming in the door that doesn't automatically close behind them, and try to guess which ones are conscientious and take a second to close it firmly. It's about 70:30 in favor of the assholes. We sat there with our Macs and our indie-band TShirts and smugged it up in the knowledge that we are so much better than, well, everyone.  More fun games to play at Lux:  1)count the Obama bumper stickers on the cars in the lot 2)count the Prius's (Prii?) (OK, one is mine) 3)count the Macs 4)count the non-Macs, then point and laugh at him 5)count the hair colors Oh, it goes on. But I kid. I go there every time I have a day off.",

I called Lux and left a message.  She called the next day saying they're getting the kinks out and offered another if my wife and I give them another chance.  So an extra star for that.  Very nice place with oppressive levels of hipsters.  Which is either fun or off-putting depending on how you're wired.  Though it is nice to not have a single Ed Hardy in the entire place.  As other reviewers have noted, the menus & drink lists written on clear glass are difficult to read.  And you have to find where they are.  Food looked yummy though.  Place is so hip it hurts.",

My friends and I came here every Wednesday night last year and we always had an awesome time. It does get crowded here very quickly so don't expect to bring a large group here and find seating. The structure of the building does not provide lots of room, so come earlier if you want seating or sit outside. My group was louder and consisted of 8-10 people so sitting outside was always the best. Quick service and I am always a fan of latte art. My favorite coffee shop in Phoenix to hang out and to study.",

You can sometimes get work done but sometimes you can get distracted by all that is going on around you.  It's definitely a good place to meet new people, and its conveniently located close to the light rail.  For those who like to bike, there are also plenty of spaces where you can lock up your bike.  :)",

It can get a bit crowded, but I think that's all part of the atmosphere. The only reason I give it four stars is because the service is different on any given day. I've had awesome, friendly baristas before and I've also had sullen, douchey hipster baristas who aren't overly friendly. Service is really important for me. Overall though, I really enjoy the drinks and the food menu.  If you're in the area you should definitely check out this artsy, hipster hangout.",

The decor is amazing. A marriage of Anthropologie and DIY modern homestyle. In fact, I'd live here if I could.  I haven't actually been for dinner... I've seen the portion sizes and I can't bring myself to spend that much money for so little food (and there's a lack of vegetarian options sometimes -- I prefer more than just salad) but if I felt like treating myself or went for date night I'd happily give my money to this establishment.   Perfect for a study session. Perfect for catching up with friends. Perfect for a casual date.

It is the chick sitting next to you in ray bans, red lipstick, and a crop top talking about lesbians and farmers markets and vegan peanut butter brownies.

I just have to say for the record, that i think their espresso gets better every single time I'm there.  Or maybe I just fall in love with it a little more each day! Seriously, shit is good.  I used to not be able to focus in here with all the 'scene-y' stuff (alluded to in other reviews) but now i've found that if i have work to do the noise and the people kind of make me motivated. It can get really dull working at your desk in your house.  I like that people hate so much on the mac-using, trendy people in the shop. Seriously? Who gives a shit? Unless they are mean to you or talk loudly about the previous nights parliament-smoking, pbr-drinking escapades - do you really care what kind of computer system they use and how skinny their jeans are? If so, I think it's time for a little introspection. But maybe i just take personal question to those reviews since i own a mac and am always working there :)  But either way - their pastries are divine, their espresso is excellent, and i have never in ALL of my visits to lux had a rude, pretentious, too-good, whatever barista. ever. they are really kind to everyone that ive ever watched order a drink.  i do get quite pissy however - when people sit down at shared tables and continue to cross, shift, and move themselves inevitably hitting the shared table about 8,000 times and spilling my coffee about 8,000 times. Come on folks, shared table...can i get a little consideration for your fellow coffee drinkers!?  the end.",

    "text": "As much as I love Lux, I'm kinda glad that it's not closer to my house, otherwise they might have all of my money. Working from home, I need to get out and set up shop elsewhere every once in a while so that I don't start talking to my houseplants, and more often than not, Lux is my destination.  The service at Lux is always friendly and often funny. And I've sat close enough to the register enough times to hear them being friendly to people of all ages, shapes and sizes. The coffee is rich, dark and delicious. I usually stick with a house coffee with soy milk, so I do ok price-wise. I even buy the whole beans to brew my own coffee at home. I like it that much.  Lux gets packed, but I've always been able to find a space and get access to an outlet for my power sucking laptop (not an apple, by the by). The music is good and mellow--think the Shins or the Stones. They've also got killer pastries, and if you time it right, you'll get them fresh out da oven.  Coffee shops are all kind of a personal preference thing. There are lots of good spots in Phoenix, but Lux is my favorite.",

Your clothes will smell like burnt chocolate, or, um roasted coffee beans.  Not my favorite aroma.\r \r The sweets, made with love by the proprietor of 'Tart' are excellent as well!",

I'd love it if the chairs were more comfortable, but the rest of the atmosphere  makes up for it! The baristas are all wonderful and are always smiling (another post said the contrary, but it takes a smile to get one)! I also appreciate the hours of the coffee shop---I can stop on the way to work and read there in the evening until late (sometimes I go twice in one day!)  I also love getting a sandwich at Pane Bianco next door and a soy chai from Lux to go with it!  Among the best in Phoenix--keep it up!",

I've been coming here for a few years and it's a few blocks from my house and I definitely enjoy the calm vibe this place sets.  Despite what I said earlier, I'm really not knocking the food or coffee at this place. It's pretty good, but overpriced. In essence, you're paying more for the atmosphere of the place, so it makes sense. It's nice to find a place like this in Phoenix because I'd totally expect a coffeebar as such to be in Silverlake or Manhattan. Lux is a great place to read, share conversation, or just enjoy a hot cup of whatever. That being said, I'm not a die-hard fan of this place like some, but I enjoy stopping by every now and then.  Chances are if you're going to Lux you're one of two people: someone whose friend brought them along, or you want to look cool by going to a hip coffee shop. I've been reading alot of the negative reviews of this place and I don't see how those reviewers didn't know what they were getting in to. Just admit that you busted out your American Apparrel shirt and brought your copy of Wallpaper magazine to read while you sip your chai. It's alright, everyone does it there.",

I read the reviews before I went and someone posted that the pizza was like a frozen pizza and I couldn't agree more!  The crust was paper thin and soggy, it was horrible!  When I opened t he box, I couldn't believe my eyes, the pizza was pathetic.  I had called my order in and specified a time to pick up my order, and when I arrived, they couldn't find my order and I had to wait while they tried to find it, which they eventually did.  When I got it home, it was luke warm, at best.  Also, the prices on their website were three dollars less for the size I ordered than what I was charged.  Update your website!  It's nice to see new businesses move into our neighborhood, but so disappointed and won't go back, for sure. I can't even give it one star, but unfortaunately you can't post unless you choose a star.",

I ordered an espresso and bought a \"healthy\" muffin filled with blueberries, carrots, possibly zucchini, an apple slice and covered in oats. It was like a brick in my stomach.   I don't know, I guess I don't get the whole \"hang out in a coffee bar\" thing. Especially students. Guess what guys there is a great place you can take your laptop and 30 textbooks and study in peace and quiet...a library. go there.   Lux is cramped but everyone seems to love it.

The egg and vegetable scramble was bland with mostly cauliflower a just a tiny bit of spinach. The pastries are gorgeous to look at - things I had were good: bread and butter, croissant with ham and cheese and chocolate chip cookies.

A friend gave me a gift card, we had a nice dinner, and with the leftover decided to go next door, a few weeks later. Why can you not use a Tarbell's gift card at both restaurants?  It's Tarbell's?  Maybe our server was misinformed? Fox gift cards can be used at any of his venues.",

I'll give them credit for not going to Starbucks but they probably tried and the furniture was too hard.

We got the pumpkin choclate chip muffins, the fruit and granola yogurt cup. Also got the oatmeal with seasonal fruit and walnuts. For drinks my husband got a medium dark roast coffee and I got the medium black and white mocha. Everything was great including the service. The place was very busy and the service we received was fast and friendly. They had a dj playing music and the atmosphere was pleasant. I highly recommend giving this place a visit. I know we will be returning again in the future. Thank u lux for the awesome experience.",

We came here on a Sunday evening and I felt like I was in Tempe. It's a college hangout, to say the least. We sat outside to get away from the noise, only to be surrounded by obnoxious conversations outside. Also, my girlfriend asked for a glass of dry Cabernet...they gave her a red blend that tasted like Arbor Mist.   We expected a mature atmosphere based on the website and reviews. Clearly that's not the case.   If you're early college age, you'll probably love it. Otherwise, get your coffee to go.",

You know how in Raiders of the Lost Ark you have to close your eyes so you don't see the Ark and die? Same deal here with the bakery case. Your vegan, vegetarian, or full-on animal-fat-loving self will leave Lux a hundred pounds heavier (and a hundred dollars lighter) if you stare too long. I don't know how their baker does what she does, but it's a rare day the whole damn spread doesn't just look totally amazing.   I think she make actually be a witch; I once resignedly ordered a gluten-free vegan donut and it was somehow perfectly tender and delicious and an exact facsimile of an actual cake donut. Gluten-free alone and vegan alone are enough to stymie even the best pastry chefs, but she checks off both boxes at once and it's not only edible but totally delicious? Witchcraft! Delicious, satisfying witchcraft!",

Anyways, the coffee was outstanding. The oatmeal was maybe the best oatmeal I've ever had in my life. Seriously. Organic steel cut oats with candied pecans and blueberries. Really, it was outstanding! Served in this giant mug that makes you feel super warm and comfy. Also, like I mentioned before, the place is massive and the space was filled in with people sitting, chatting, working, etc. Thankfully, finding a seat is not difficult. Some are communal.

I forgot what the pastry was but it was quite good. It went well with the coffee as it balanced each others taste. I am normally not a pastry person but their pastries looked good so I wanted to give it a try. I definitely will be trying other things the next time I come here.

    "text": "We come here after hikes and the coffee is great - I don't drink coffee but my girlfriend got me hooked on their iced vanilla lattes they're that good. She's boring and just gets an iced coffee #health. I get their breakfast sandwich and attempt to force feed my gf until she gets mad and swats my hand away and tells me I'm annoying. Whatever they do with this sandwich, they're doing it right.   We've been meaning to try their homemade pop tarts. My gf comments on them every time and never orders one. JUST GET IT is what I tell her. One day I'll get one and crush it up into her basic bitch coffee.   Order their whipped cream with your  coffee - it's homemade and so good. I also try to force feed this to my girlfriend and she just about moves tables to get away from me. Our dog gets a puppuccino - Lux has the Rolls Royce of puppuccinos but now we've spoiled her and our dog refuses to eat puppuccinos from Starbucks.   We've been meaning to come back for cocktails because they look like they do some artisanal type shit there and I'm sure they're amazing.",

    "text": "I've been to Lux a few times since living in Phoenix and I kinda just think this place is a hype to be honest. It's not bad by any means I just don't see why it's always so busy and popular. I came in today an ordered a cold brew and I was told that they only serve their cold brews in these glass bottles that cost $6. I honestly didn't want such a large amount of cold brew, I just wanted a small one. The gentleman did tell me that if i bring the bottle back then it will be a $3 refill which is nice but I don't frequent Lux that often so I probably won't get much use out of it. I think there are some better local coffee shops around the Valley.",

I ordered the coffee cake and a cup of iced coffee, and in the line with me was the former Mayor of the City of Phoenix. He was kind enough to buy me breakfast! He was raving about the place to me, telling me that he enjoys everything they sell here.   The coffee cake definitely did not disappoint, it was a decent sized piece, that went amazingly well with the cup of delicious iced coffee which was perfectly made.   The interior is adorable, with options to sit on a couch, chair, or even at the bar.",

It's a little tucked away but once you see the line of sneaker heads snaked around the shop two doors down waiting for the latest release, you'll know you're in the right spot. The energy at 8am on a Friday was palpable- they even had an actual DJ spinning tunes to warm you up for the day. I ordered a hot vanilla almond milk chai, and a slice of quiche. The chai was delicious; carefully brewed, and on the spicy side. The quiche could have been a little warmer, but was pretty good as well. The atmosphere and delicious drink combine to make this a spot definitely worth a return trip. Be sure to walk through the whole shop if you're looking for a quiet spot to post up with a book. There are a couple of rooms in the back that are separated with the potentially overwhelming hum up front near the counter!",

But I was in the area for work, and was trying to figure out a quick lunch spot to grab something to eat in between. I found Lux, which is a solid place. Was lucky to grab a spot in their smaller parking lot and ordered the grilled cheese w/tomato soup for lunch, which was quite tasty. The staff was also really accommodating and friendly, which goes a long way in my book.   Lots of other folks were there, many of whom were also studying/working, but there still seemed to be a number of places to sit. I didn't have much of a hankering for caffeine when I was there, so I didn't get the chance to try one of their many coffee offerings, but I'm sure they are also delicious. Would recommend for a quick and tasty bite if you're in the area!",

Our patio table was covered in crumbs and cinnamon when we sat down and didn't see any bus staff on the patio for over 45 minutes when someone came to clear our plates. However, he didn't remove the old dishes from previous people or wipe up the crumbs, which I had mostly brushed to the side with a menu.   My dining partner told the bus person her veggie hash didn't have any veggies (except potatoes) . He told her she could go back inside and tell them and they would give her more. She did. They gave her money back for the hash, with kind of a deer in the headlights look. Cook was sympathetic and helpful. We do recommend updating the menu, changing \"veggie hash\" to \"potatoe hash\"... ;)   I did inform the busperson  that the crumbs and dirty glasses were from prior guests and we'd been here a long time. He said \"OK\", wandered way then came back a few minutes later and brushed the crumbs onto the ground with his hand. On closer inspection, there are hash browns strewn about the ground as well so the crumbs won't be lonely.   My dining partner speculated that maybe everyone was stoned. Maybe not everyone?",

The service is inconsistent - some star players, some lazy ppl, some who don't care.   There have been a lot of times where whole tables have dirty dishes scattered across and crumbs everywhere while they have a surplus of ppl working the front. Pretty much every time I come here (2-4x a week). Generally, the place is not clean.   I'm sure ppl would be happy to move the dishes themselves if there was a noticeable sign or something.  They've also left my food go cold instead of coming to the back to just let me know it was ready (as they normally do but sometimes they just don't feel like it). Seems unusual to me that a \"cool\" shop doesn't have the most customer-centric culture.  I come for the workspaces and it's close. But if you want another shop with good space and better service, go to Sip Coffee and Beer Garage on Indian School!",

The Latte wasn't as sweet as I would normally prefer but that's nothing that can't be solved by a little of Sugar In The Raw.

Unusual open concept kitchen with basket of food along the counters which worked with the atmosphere. -Espresso: smooth espresso! The Quattro con panna was delicious with the smallest hint of sweetness and nice smooth espresso. Made me want to try all of their coffee concoctions.  -Options for coffee and wine: I like this combination and it was executed well in the building itself, being somewhat separate from each other -Baked good: a good ol' choc chip cookie. Not much more to say about a cookie. :)   What We Disliked: -Not much. Just maybe the cleanliness.   Overall, a hip \"young\" place packed with 20 and early 30-somethings. Most people were studying with their laptops at all the eclectic tables. It seems like a place to meet new people and the vibe was casual and friendly. The tables, seating and building itself is certainly rough around the edges but it works for this place. The chairs and tables are not very comfortable so I wouldn't come here to chit-chat for a couple hours with a friend at the tables but I would come here to study at them. Although I didn't sit at the bar, that did look inviting. I would come back to try the wine, more coffee, and their other delicious-looking baked goods.",

Wine selection is good, mixologists are on point and you can even see all the fresh ingredients they use. It's always super packed and annoying to try and find a spot. I am not a fan of the hipster crowd so the \"ironic\" decor and pretentious \"artists\" I could do without but it does allow for people watching while you enjoy an excellent cocktail or top notch coffee. The Mac n cheese is heavenly. Fight through the regular patrons. It's worth it.",

It's all rocks so it gets dusty and there's no lights or music out there. I think if they just got some string bulb lights, some speakers and maybe filled in the dirt and rocks with all sidewalk it would be a perfect patio   parking is usually tight in the back and it's kind of a hard place to find cause there's not a sign but it's awesome I love coming here to study or hang with friends",

    "text": "Since my bf needs caffiene to function in the mornings, I took the opportunity to drag him to Lux to try out somewhere other than Starbucks. We normally grind beans and brew our own coffee in the morning, and rotate between Starbucks beans and beans from specialty coffee roasters. I wanted to try a latte or macchiato, but since we were in a hurry we went with the Large House Coffee (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lux-phoenix?select=jJcHfe0zVCHuuBLVaHuoGQ#jJcHfe0zVCHuuBLVaHuoGQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/lux-...</a>), which was a very light and drinkable coffee. It wasn't as flavorful as the coffee I had later on from Cartel. I regret not purchasing beans from Lux to bring home and try, but will have to make sure I do that on my next visit to Arizona. Lux also sells a variety of baked goods, and I purchased a slice of the Raspberry Almond Buckle (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/lux-phoenix?select=jJcHfe0zVCHuuBLVaHuoGQ#WXpjlFSUd3EhNgePXJO_Lw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/lux-...</a>) which was DELICIOUS. I loved the almond-y taste of the buckle, and the fluffiness of the cake. The raspberries also added a slight tartiness which was really nice.   Lux also serves breakfast (along with lunch and dinner), and the menu looked really good! The majority of people in line were ordering breakfast items, so I'm assuming they have some solid dishes. There was a line when I first entered, but it moved pretty quickly. There were plenty of tables to sit at, and it seems like a great place to relax with friends, study, or browse the internet. The staff was really friendly, and the prices reasonable. Parking might be the only drawback, since they have a lot, but it's narrow and doesn't have that many spots.",

Nonetheless, this IS my favorite coffee house in the Phoenix Valley, and I could say that its one of my favorite locations to get a drink after work... and I could also say that their baked goods and dishes are so yummy that its one of my favorite little restaurants as well.  Its eclecticness is much of its charm, but everything is also so very well done.  Upon my first visit there -- as part of an eclectic, hardworking group of maybe 10 activists, academics, and lawyers at the end of a very long day -- our group stumbled in to Lux, which was a little disorienting having never been there and not knowing what to expect (its a very unique but comfortable environment).  Almost immediately, we were welcomed in by someone (an owner?) who found us some seats, made us some drinks, talked with us for a bit... showed me around, explained the menu to me and, despite the crazy frenetic buzz of that evening, in very short time we all felt really comfortable, a part things (for lack of a better description), and had a really nice, memorable evening.  In the mornings, coffee & espresso drinks are simply wonderful... the various freshly baked things are just wow-good.  I love Lux (see you in the morning!).",

    "text": "WOW...    I find these few negative reviews rather funny.  I will comment on them after the more important stuff, like the actual quality you will find at LUX.  I have been coming here since 2003.  It was a tiny box back then, but one of the first and only places one could find a Dirty Chai.  In fact, it was one of the only places you could find good coffee or a barista in Phoenix back then.  Sorry, starbucks is NOT good coffee, so that doesn't count.  That being said, it has grown, expanded and pretty much delivers one of everything you could want.  The ingredients are always fresh...  baking goods constantly.  They do not EVER skimp on quality of ingredients.  The prices are just ridiculously UNDER priced for what you are getting.    The mixology bar or \"bar\" if you will is LOADED with top shelf booze and fresh ingredients as well...  I know this because every morning when I go to get my coffee, the morning bartenders are squeezing fresh juice from just about everything you can imagine.    The breakfast items are amazing and consistent every time...  and again, totally affordable.  Coffee for a cup is $2?  Where do you even get a $2 cup of coffee anymore?  Here.  So do the baristas a favor and put that extra dollar you just saved in that ceramic jar just to the side of the register, they will appreciate it.    Dinner is equally fresh.  They offer a spartan menu of gourmet items made with FRESH ingredients handled with care.  Mac N Cheese is always on the menu for $5 - it has almost made me a fat kid it's so addicting and good.  It seems most people complain about it being too crowded or overly hipster...  I mean seriously folks, it is good.  It is popular.  So there may be a lot of people there. You might have to park on the street and walk 500 feet to get there.  You aren't going to die.  The hip people, the yuppies, the business professionals, the bohemes, the families, they aren't going to hurt you.  You don't need to waste time criticizing people, that is just too hypocritical to your point.  Just be yourself like everyone else is.  and to the service...  they hire awesome people here.  They are are highly skilled at what they do.  I find them a pleasant bunch.  Most of them are young, so things like fashion and music are important to them...  maybe that is why you think they are overly hip.  They are not uptight or mean by any measure.  If you get bad service here it is probably because you are being an entitled asshole perhaps.    Bottom line, it is pretty much the first and best in Phoenix and still upholds the quality it started with.  It has grown just as much as Phoenix has.   Cya tmrw.",

I took the day off work for my birthday, and was surprised to see a line to the door at 9:00 am on a Monday. The line was rarely shorter. Nothing against the establishment, because this obviously means that Lux is doing something right, but who are these people? Who has the time and money to get a coffee from Lux on a Monday morning? Just wondering. Maybe everyone else had the day off, too.  I'll be taking out of town friends here every time they visit, because the drinks are good and the location is great.",

And once you get inside, it's like a maze, you really have to snake your way through these sectioned off rooms to get to the counter and order. The decor, layout, the people there...really hipster for Arizona. I had the chicken tortilla soup (wasn't impressed) and some squash and risotto (that had no risotto in it because it apparently was reduced down to nothing) so it was basically just squash. Trust me, I asked.   When you line up to order, someone takes your drink order first and starts making your drink.....and then you order your food separately. That sounds great...because it seems like it's more efficient, but then when we paid, we realized that the person that took our drink order didn't communicate that with the person that rung us up, we ended up not paying for the drinks, so we didn't get any drinks, and we only got our food. Hmmm...maybe efficiency doesn't always equal accuracy.   I think if I was younger and more hipster, I would like this place. But I wasn't super into the vibe here and I was really not into all the sectioned off rooms that made the whole place just super confusing to navigate.",

One of my top three coffee places in Phoenix. Has a real cool vibe and they are always playing good tunes.  The interior is a mish-mash of ultramodern furniture, some long benches and some old hand-me-down furnishings. Somehow all these incongruities add up to something unique and cool. I also LOVE the hours they keep. I can pop in for an Americano (decaf after 6:00pm) at 9:00pm and hang out and chill for a while. Just beware, this place (rightfully so) is ALWAYS packed and parking can be tough. But don't let that deter you.",

My husband and I ordered iced coffee. It's always good, totally solid. Just the right amount of acidity, just the right amount of depth. The lines are long, yes...but this is some of the best coffee in town, so IT'S WORTH IT. Also, the staff is great about having the drinks ready shortly after you pay - they take your drink order while you're still waiting in line to reach the register. They've got their system down to a science.   Also, once upon a time (in March 2014, maybe?) I had an espresso with lavender, agave, cinnamon...maybe some other things. It wasn't amazingly executed, but it was incredibly imaginative. I still give them props for taking this step.",

You will immediately feel comfortable here. The front room is usually crowed, but there are two more rooms in the back. All kinds of people hang out here. Young or old, rich or poor, professionals or house wives/husbands, dark or light skinned.  The coffee is reasonably good since they roast it on site. I also like their fresh squeezed juice. I haven't tried the breakfast yet. It seems pricy. The lunch menu changes daily. They post it on facebook. They offer organic dishes. The portion is very small and expect to pay twice as much.",

Coffee is average, staff are rude and appear displeased and unhappy to work there, at least that's what they radiate to the customers. Just because the place is always full, doesn't mean they shouldn't appreciate customers! Isn't that business 101?!  Occasionally they have a live DJ which lightens up the place and adds a nice East coast flavor to it. Pastries are good and of satisfactory variety, but they keep them out in the open and I have seen fly on them frequently. I advised the staff and they simply ignored and said nothing they could do about it and I shouldn't order if I have a problem with it! Wow! I liked them more when they were in the next door lot and were much smaller.....it seemed they appreciated customers' business more and valued customer service more. My friends and coworkers have the same opinion, btw.",

From when you walk in you can see this place is a coffee shop, bakery, beer and wine bar, and restaurant all in one. Oh almost forgot, just 1 huge hangout spot! I felt totally relaxed talking to a group of friend over drinks.   I specifically ordered the green tea and it was suggested I try the pinnacle mango flavor and I'm glad I ordered it. Very yummy. Wife ordered the six shooter which she could only finish half way, talk about a Jolt!! Basically coffee with 6 shots of espresso! Might be good for late night cram or a cross country road trip.lol.  I got a chance to walk around and there are lots of rooms where you can study or meet with people. Plus I saw a bar where you can sit in front off as well as a few couches. Overall this place rocks. Soon my favorite coffee shop in Phx. Reminded me of a modern day Willow House from back in the day!  I just wish I lived closer so I could actually call Lux my neighborhood coffee shop.",

You will likely have to wait in some sort of line, depending on when you go. Your patience will be rewarded by your taste buds singing praise for a job well done. Most of their drinks tend to run less sweet (which isn't a bad thing) but they provide a variety of sweetener options to enhance the flavor to your preference.  I recommend picking up coffee beans if you have a grinder, or alternatively, I believe they can grind it for you.  This is truly a gem in Phoenix and without a doubt, my favorite coffee joint.",

I love ordering the honey velvet with almond milk. It's a great way to start my day. For breakfast I usually get the egg sandwich with bacon cheese and tomatoes. Delicious!

    "text": "Lux is a solid go to whenever I'm in Phoenix. Delicious pastries, breakfasts and solid baristas preparing solid espresso drinks; the last of which is not easy to find in Phoenix (my guess is due to the heat and locals' preference for cold bevvies). Normally a place this good I'd give 5 stars to. I'm a regular when in town, the service is excellent, the space is cool and for a more food centered establishment they make great coffee beverages. My issue is 1) the price of their coffee drinks. I am sympathetic to the rising costs of coffee but given the cost of living in Phoenix (and rents) combined with the fact that their coffee drinks, while good, are not top tier: $4.50 for an 8oz latte is way above the market. In San Diego, where all costs are significantly higher in running a business, I can get the same drink for $3.25 to $3.75. That's a large variance percentage wise. Issue 2) throw me a bone on some healthier options. Lux has the capacity to make healthy items but just opts to generously use oil, butter, or what have you. I frankly find this is a Phoenix phenomena, but would have expected a place like Lux to offer some slightly lighter food options. Even if it is just one for each meal of the day. And vegetarian doesn't automatically qualify as light as an aside!   My nitpicking aside, I highly recommend Lux, but know your wallet will be lighter and you will be heavier.",

It's difficult to find. Where the DOOR? Where do you order what? I didn't understand the craze.  Lux is esoteric. It's snobby. It's hip. And it has grown on me.   The quality the last six months or so has shot way up. Rumor is they have a new roaster, and goddamn, GODDAMN, if he isn't good. When I buy beans to take home, my entire kitchen is swallowed in that sweet smell.   Vegan donuts? Pimm's cups with real muddled fruit? Much, much better customer service, attention to detail, and expanded food/bar options? I'm impressed, Lux, I really am.   Good job.",

The main reason I do not like to come here a lot is because it is always so crowded and it is often difficult to find somewhere to sit, especially to do homework. There have been many times where I have walked in and immediately left because there was no room. However, I believe that Lux has a large space and much seating, they are just so popular it is hard to find room.  If you end up finding a seat, I highly recommend ordering the velvet latte, it is by far my favorite, I got it once a few years ago and have not looked back since.  I still come to Lux sometimes, but usually if I am picking up to-go.  On calmer nights, it is nice to sit at the bar and get a drink, as their bartenders are more than that, they are artisans and they take their time to make sure your drink is perfect.",

Coffee and tea: good, like most specialty places that serve it (Cartel, Echo, Urban Beans, JoBot, etc etc etc). But let's talk about the REALITIES of a trip to (not)Lux.  There are many parking spaces that are usually taken. My guess is more than 70% of the crowd here are students who spend all day working over a cup of coffee and maybe a sssscccccooooonnnneeee. The \"Order Here\" counter is placed right along the entrance, so when lines back up, they are backing up into a seating area. God help you if that mommy with her two toddlers are seated at an entrance-area table. Good luck getting past that, boss.  The employees here are beyond obnoxious. Gave 'em multiple chances to be cool. They ain't. The baked goods are all pretty much blah/dry/not good. On our first visit to (not)Lux, we sampled much of the pastry menu to-go, because we had heard good things. But much like Cartel, Lux is all hype and not comfort, goodness or fun. It's pain. Pain to find parking. Pain to wait in the interminable line. Pain to deal with the 24-year-old baristas and register jockeys. Pain to find a place to sit. AAARRRGGGHHH!!!  If you're young and down to study and stare, this place is for you. If you aren't 18-25 and wearing flannel, jean shorts, Converse All-Stars, hipster glasses (prescription or otherwise), really wanna live in Portland, have iPod earbuds soldered into your head.............move along, because there's nothing to see here.",

And for a bit of sweet and savory, pair it with the Belgian pancake with mixed berries!  The DJ is a nice touch.  Everyone can do with a bit of mood enhancement in the morning.  I complained once... and the manager responded.  He was attentive and earnest.  As for the hip vibe... yes, it's all that - so the hipster admonishments in the other posts are a bit gratuitous.  If you don't like hipsters, go to Starbucks.  But, that is more about personal choice.    If I have one ongoing peeve, it relates to the made-to-order food ordering.  I don't get the concept of running coffee orders before you reach the register - so that by the time you pay, the steaming brew is at the counter.  Why they don't extend the same service to food ordering is maddening.  The line can run out the door.  So, one stands in line for a good 15 mins to then have to place a food order and wait another 10-15mins for it to be ready.  PLEASE change that process.  Otherwise... LUX is my favorite breakfast spot in Phoenix!",

Tonight was the first night that I went to Lux with the purpose of relaxing with friends. I can't tell you what a completely different experience this was! Blaise, the bartender, blew me away with his delicious and hand-crafted drinks. One drink literally had a arrow, craftily cut from the rind of an orange; and all were delicious.   I can't tell you how relaxed I was sitting at the bar (where they serve drinks and food). It was a 180 from my experiences using Lux to engage in less fun activities!  That's why I'm giving Lux five stars--- I have always loved their coffees, teas, baked goods, salads and entrees, but I was stressed for my own reasons. Now I see the versatility of Lux-- that it can be a place to get work done, relax and have a drink with friends, meet new people, or celebrate! It's truly the venue for any occasion!  -- The staff is also incredible!",

    "text": "While trekking across the western states and stopping in Phoenix for the night, we decided to stop by Lux for a breakfast on our way to California. We arrived roughly after 9am on a Monday morning. Lux appeared to be nestle in a cool and hip part of Phoenix as there were some interesting shops and restaurants in it's proximity. Lux has it's own parking lot, which I'm not sure that is shared with the other business,but when we arrived there was ample parking spaces.   On the exterior, there is a somewhat spacious patio allowing patrons to sit outside when weather permits. On the inside there is an eclectic array of mix n  match furniture which gives it that cool vibe. There is a small kitchen open to the room showcasing their variety of baked goods. It was very cool to see the employees working as we were waiting for our food.   I ordered my usual breakfast when I'm in a rush or wanting to eat light, a butter croissant and glass of orange juice. The croissant was very good, very airy and decent flakiness. The orange juice was freshly squeezed. My friend ordered the quiche which was warmed up in their conventional oven instead of the microwave. It appeared they put love in their preparation of the food.   Lux also serves lunch and dinner, and has a bar.",

Cool atmosphere (multiple rooms with tables/chairs) with free wifi - when you need to spend some time doing research or work.  I've been able to catch parts of a game on the large screen room (just a plus).  Its usually crowded with a never ending amazing mix of people - so if you like to be \"alone\" - maybe not your place.  An unusual mix of music - which I enjoy.  Nice outdoor seating as well.  Parking can be limited, though can park down the street.",

The dominant flavor of said Chai was the milk. That's a bummer. Couldn't really taste any tea, honey/sugar, cinnamon. Just kind of a watery, milky drink. I've very honestly had better Chai at a QT - at least its cheaper.   I'm sure they must do other stuff well. They seem to be well-loved. The baked goods look pretty good, and I assume the coffee is good, I just don't drink coffee.   The Chai is really one star, but the place has a nice ambiance to it, and the soap in the bathroom was actually quite nice (lol), and so I compromise at two stars.",

Nice big cafe with lots of indoor seating and they have a smaller outdoor seating area also. Food is delish and service is on point. They even serve alcohol for those of us who are of age. Wifi is good too.  Great vibe with a very diverse and hip crowd. You will find students to folks who plop down to get some work done. Oh and music flows throughout the whole place. I really enjoy it here. If you are looking for quiet this is not the place to go. If you are looking for great service, good food and a place that is buzzing then this is your spot.",

Coffee is great, the Lux roast is delicious and a great base for lots of yummy drinks. Food is great as well.   That said, the vibe is the best part. Most people that end up there with me tell me they no longer feel like they're in Phoenix. I understand what they're getting at, but I disagree in that Lux is the epitome of the new Phoenix, with great food, great art and a vibrant emerging culture all our own.   Lux has won 3 years in a row as my favorite place to sit on a pink leather couch. And after spending some quality time people watching and enjoying the food and drink, you can wander on over to the bar and cap off the evening with some of the best bar work in town.   What I'm trying to say is I need to figure out how to live within walking distance so I can spend even more time there.",

    "text": "That moment when you order your \"favorite\" thing... when you taste it, it's so delicious you get angry at all the impostures that made you order it to begin with!  This happens to me anytime I adventure away from my usual order at lux.  This has happened to me here the first time I've ordered the americano, the yogurt parfait, and the scones. The bakers here are legit le cordon bleu graduates from what I hear (and taste).    The brown sugar macadamia scone is this glistening golden glimmer of a pastry with a crumbly biscuit texture on the outside and gooey butter cream in the center.  When I first laid eyes on the one selected for me I actually thought \"she gave me the good one!\" It had me asking deep questions about the universe.    At times, the line is long but no worries the staff actually is efficient and gets through it in minutes.  The only downside is the coffee condiment area is booty to booty with the people ordering & paying.  No worries as everyone moves through pretty quickly.   The decor and art at lux is perfection: hip coffee atmosphere achieved.  Literally, the best people watching with 2 outdoor areas.  Usually I'll eat inside and then enjoy my pastry outside because I like to bring my Jack Russell terrier and tie her on the bench in front of pane bianco.    My final tip- if it sounds or looks good definitely order it.",

Regardless of all that though, they have some of the best coffee in town & the most amazing baked goods! Everything is made fresh in house & you can tell! Their food is also always delicious & reasonably priced. The bartenders take their jobs very seriously & will gladly pour you a drink or ask them to make something custom & you'll really see their skills come out!

When I travel I usually visit a local coffeehouse and support small local businesses. When I saw that Lux was nearby and had outstanding reviews, I told my BFF we had to come after our dinner. We drove to Lux, and it was packed. There is a small parking and then street parking. We luckily found a spot in the lot, and inside we went.  We were a little confused as to how to order. There seemed to be a couple lines or just people standing around waiting for their orders ? I do appreciate that there was an employee who were taking orders while people were standing around so that people had less wait for their drinks. My friend had ordered a house drip coffee, and since I can't drink regular coffee at night, I asked the lady at the register if they served decaf. The lady gave me a dirty look and said \"no!\". Talk about attitude! I know this is a coffee house, and perhaps you may not serve drip decaf, but no need for attitude! Even my BFF mentioned that she had attitude and wasn't professional. Since I didn't get any coffee, I ended up getting a cookie to go.  We were considering eating a light snack, but after our customer service, we decided to just leave. There were lot of people studying in the coffeehouse and the tables were filled. Seemed like a nice place to hang out, but based on our experience, we aren't coming back. Very unfortunate.",

I ordered their biscuits and chorizo gravy and all I have to say is...all gravy poured on top of biscuits should be made with chorizo!  The extra flavor and slight kick to it made this way better than I've ever tasted elsewhere.  I recently had biscuits and gravy in Portland (at a very delicious breakfast spot) and it didn't compare at all!  Sigh.  I did have a mocha and didn't quite prefer it at all.  It had that super burnt coffee taste to it, even with some honey and sweetener.  Blech!

First it is hard to find-never saw a sign outside but went by my GPS-which worked well. Went inside quite early in the morning-just a few people there,mostly employees. Was greeted, looked around & settled down to await my friend that was joining me. No one mentioned to me that one has to go up & order what you want-essentially you wait on yourself. They will call you when your order is ready. They have fresh squeezed O.J., Grapefruit juice & homemade lemonade.  I'm a juice junkie & tried the O.J. Yummm! It did not disappoint! My friend arrived & we checked out our selections available, settled on two different quiches-one Quiche Lorraine & one 3 cheese Quiche-we split both between us & they were excellent! We also shared the Dutch pancake with strawberries & blueberries & homemade whipped cream-it was a delight. We had coffee-which was made all the better with steamed cream in mine-an unexpected bonus! While we were eating, we enjoyed watching all the goodies coming out of the oven. The staff was great about explaining what everything was. All in all it was a great time! More of a gathering place with great food & drinks! We'll be back!",

The \"trendy-ness\" of the place doesn't make up for the fact that I feel slightly uncomfortable sitting in some of the old, torn chairs. I've had various meetings here, which it's great for if you're able to find the space and don't mind raising your voice to speak to whomever you're with.  That all said, the breakfast sandwich is ONE OF THE BEST in the whole valley.",

    "text": "I have really tried NOT to like this place. Its busy, its almost too hip, and it can be quite loud at times. But every time I get food, a cocktail, or a coffee drink, I am just won over by their top quality stuff. They are all well trained in their craft and never disappoint when it comes to their food and drinks. A lot of people are thrown off by the long line, but even if there is a line to the door, you usually don't have to wait for than 9-10 minutes. So it really isn't too bad.  Their classic drip coffee is also really good! Usually premade drip coffee tastes old, bitter, and gross. But they have an excellent drip machine and a great blend that is bright but still balanced and that's often hard to do with pre-made drip. Definitely try it when you are there next. Also... no brainer... get the whip cream on everything. just do it.",

The bathroom is harder to find since it's tucked away by their storage. I'd definitely come back!",

    "text": "Hipster watering hole! Lux was my neighbor growing up but since I grew up \"poor\", I only discovered it's existence as a young professional. Slightly salty. Objectively speaking, the open kitchen concept, raw ingredients and urban clientele makes it a Phoenix hallmark.  *ENTRANCE is not on the Main Street.  They offer a wide variety of food (breakfast-dinner). Also have a bar in the back!! I love going to chat with a friend or for solo studying. Mainstay are their quick bites, Mac and Cheese for $8.   If you want to visit, I recommend.  1) flexible schedule especially peak hours, after work and weekends.  -long lines & order wait times, time prowling for prime seats.   2) headphones, always either at a hum or loud.   Entrance:  very easy to miss. It had a modern flat design with a main entrance facing the parking lot NOT the main street. Parking is free- also street parking since the lot gets packed.  Clientele:  Best part of Lux is the ambiance. It's a hodgepodge of urbanites; students, young professionals, intellectuals.   Space: One main room, two smaller wings and patio seating. They have a variety of seating options; grouped tables with chairs (study friendly), non traditional benches and arm rests.   Guesstimate interior seating alone could fit about 80ppl.",

    "text": "Where to begin? Such a mixed review! I gave Lux a 4 star based on the incredible coffee I had.  I'm not kidding when I say I'm a coffee snob. Living in pacific NW, where brews and coffee houses are planted on every corner trying their best to out-do, out roast, and out do any Italian espresso machine on the market, I've had my fair share of coffee! And I'm not a stranger to hip coffee houses, I've seen it all in Portland Oregon, and Seattle WA.  Lux provides an incredible balanced coffee of richness to the point \"just touching the bitter notes\" in all the right ways. I'd go back a million times over just for the coffee alone. What didn't hit the mark for me was the interior. It honestly stressed me out. It's definitely not my ideal coffee house setting. But obviously, not bothered by others. I just didn't understand the concept here. It's almost like being in someone's dis-functional house.  This is a very hip, communal, messy, and dis-organized environment, id say even a bit hazardous, especially for those who may be disabled, there's no way a wheelchair could ever negotiate the interior here, or EVER use the restroom! The crowded place is taken up by couches that are torn to shreds? Did I mention they're vinyl, and equipment and supplies pushed along the walls. The four of us, fought our way to a back room, to a painted black ceiling, to black walls, not the most cheerful room. We ordered  some breakfast, veggie scramble, hash, side of bacon and a couple egg sandwiches. All done perfectly! Delicious a matter of fact! But, can I go back to sit and relax? Got to say no. Will I go back to order coffee to go? ABSOLUTELY",

I am a big fan of their dark roast and the free refills it comes with. Entrees are a overpriced but usually good if you're willing to splurge. However, I was a highly disappointed to find out the mug of macaroni and cheese doubled in price to $10. What?! It's literally a mug of pasta and I sometimes think a box of Kraft tastes better. Looks like I'll just be sticking to coffee from now on.   More than anything, Lux is about the ambience and environment. It can be stressful and overwhelming with its crowd and the music, especially for a person there for the first time. You're usually responsible for claiming your food from the counter and cleaning up your dishes, even though the bin can be tricky to find if you've never seen it before. Seating can be awkward and nearly impossible to find when it's busy, so I do NOT recommend large groups. Employees are hit or miss- either really friendly or really antisocial, as other reviews have stated.   I recommend Lux for the experience, but make sure you're in a good mood and have a healthy mindset- just a few minutes there may trigger agoraphobia and drain your funds.",

Her: 75 cents  Me: I'll take that and also can I have a tiny bit of chocolate in my quad shot?  Her: Are you sure you don't want a latte?  Me: (thinking what?) ::: Laughs::: oh no, my wife doesn't drink coffee so I'll usually just get her a glass of milk.  Her: ok  The other barista serves me a hot latte with my name on it. And the girl I've been talking to fills a small cup half way with almond milk.  Me: ::: looking at the late::: umm, I just ordered a quad shot  Her: oh that's on me (other barista starts to remake it)  Me: Also, how much more is it to fill the cup up to the top with almond milk? (Again, it's for my wife. It looks like a sad 1/2 cup of milk. I'm prepared to pay more.)  Her: It was just 75 cents  Me: :::confused:::To fill it all the way up to the top? (Thinking, Okay, I can do another 75 cents. No prob. But I'm not quite sure what she's saying.)  She's stops everything, angrily picks up the cup of almond milk turns around fills it up and throws it in the counter, never looked at me once the whole time. Clearly she's pissed.   I'm angry she's angry. She got pissed I was gonna pay more for what I originally asked for? Not to mention she got my other drink wrong. The other barista gives me my quad shot. I loudly asked if it had chocolate to other barista because first girl is not looking at me. I leave angry.   Guess I just took too long at the bustling counter with all my crazy drink orders.

The order taker/cashier was cold and unwelcoming.  Sorry to take you away from your chatting and posing.  The cooks had a little incident with a lot of smoke and their co-workers just stood around watching and smirking.  The owner or manager, not sure which, is just sitting in the back with a couple of off-shift employees having loud, dramatic phone calls about e-mails that shouldn't be sent and his hot water heater.   In the meantime, the two slices of bacon that cost an extra $3 on my baked eggs were burned black.  Wish I'd taken a picture.  The place has obviously become a too cool hang-out for the staff, and too bad they have to tolerate those annoying common customers to keep their club going.  Food and coffee is still good, but there are other good places in Phoenix where I don't get treated like a second thought.",

    "text": "This cafe is probably the most eclectic cafe I've ever encountered - and I sample cafes everywhere I go, around the country and abroad.  I think the vibe is very tough to describe, but I will tell you that I loved it! We stopped by around 8-9 pm on a Saturday night and there were people of all ages from children to retirees. It was also fascinating to see people of all ages working side by side on their laptops on long tables. I guess Im used to seeing college/grad students to young professionals who choose coffee spots as work places, but it was fascinating to see how well all the age groups blended here!   The seating is super fun aside from the long tables - there are couches spread throughout the cafe and people were just meeting up and having an awesome time. It's basically divided into a main hall and then there are a few smaller rooms with couches and tables, on of which you can actually reserve. In one room, old TV shows and sports were playing off a projector on to the wall.   The unique thing here is you can order a full meal (breakfast/lunch/dinner), get dessert or baked goods, coffee/lattes or a drink from their bar. The kitchen is open, and in fact, barely separated from the seating area so you see people working away on your food and drinks.   I got a velvet latte which was a white chocolate latte - done very, very well with a strong hint of coffee in it and the taste of white chocolate was subtle but recognizable. From desserts, I got a Nutella thumbprint cookie which was super tasty, especially with the coffee flavored whip cream that went with my friend's flourless dark chocolate cake (which was also excellent!)   The wall art is super random and fascinating! You would have to see for yourself to know what I mean, and it does make you think.   The place is VERY hipster, and people come here totally casual, and it sounds cheesy, but it is definitely a spot where you are welcome just as you are!",

They also have a bunch of chairs and old couches here to sit on. It was busy when I went and I imagine it to be that way regularly since thus place is hip and trendy, but their service more than made up for this inconvenience. When I'm back in Phoenix ill definitely be coming back here.",

I literally feel like there are two friendly people that work here and the rest act like you're a pain in their ass. It sucks because I enjoy coming here, but I find myself going to other coffee shops in this area simply because of the service here. There are two guys on the register that always get tips from me simply because they smile and are friendly while I make my payment. They need to be the ones greeting guests - they would make every one more money.",

Sparse menu, very few options for non-meat and egg eaters (hot oatmeal in the summer - no thanks), and totally unhelpful staff.  We met family there for breakfast and ordered a vegan donut, a whole grapefruit, iced tea, and a latte.  The area to pick up orders is kind of cluttered, crowded, and disorganized and there is nowhere to stand while you're waiting.  The only seating we found for 4 was in the back room, which was quiet and filled with people on laptops (one was kind enough to share his table with us) and we tried to be quiet and quick.",

Anyway, it changed hands and even changed locations [across the walkway] a few months ago.  The coffee, while no longer the best this side of Flagstaff is still really good and the home made whipped cream is always delicious.  A prior reviewer lamented that it turned its back to the street and is now open only to the rear parking lot.  In Phoenix-speak that is a betrayal of right-thinking anti-sprawlism. I agree.  Maybe a small point, maybe not.  It has a menu now!  The food keeps to the same standards as the pastries and beverages, which probably explains why there's almost always a line at the counter and rarely a 4-top available.  One thing this place has always had is a distinct personality, which changes in a big way with new ownership and many little ways with staff.  I've always loved that about it.",

The problem with the old location was size and that has definitely been resolved with the new place having tons of tables and good elbow room.   The coffee is good and the whole place has a great \"roasting\" aroma. I could even see some beans being attended to in a side room.   The wi-fi is free and this is a great answer to those who are sick of the other chain places.   The only issue I noticed was that it can get a little cramped at the counter, where the orders are taken and drinks delivered several minutes later. Not a real issue - just needs a little adjustments.",

    "text": "My favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. Step into this joint and you feel like you have been transported to a more cultured and diverse place. Its the first time I saw an Asian Barista in Phoenix.   I usually come here to study and truthfully it gets a little loud at times so bring earplugs or anything else to plug your ears with. And on weekends you may have trouble finding a seat cause the place is packed. This place needs more outlets and the wifi can be sketchy at times. That said though I have a lot of love for independent coffee shops this one included.  They make pretty good white hot chocolates here. If you get a chance try one of their italian creme sodas ( i like peach). However, good drinks is only half the battle for a coffee shop, the joint also needs good bakery goods. Now the great thing about Lux is that I am pretty sure they bake most if not all their goodies on the premises. Hence, sometimes when walking towards the bathroom area your nostrils are greeted with whiffs of deliciousness. (theres a joke in there somewhere) Their Mexican Tea Cookies are always a good bet, and are reasonably priced. What I also like about this place is that they have rewards cards which I made ample use of. The Baristas in general are pretty cool laid back folk.   So if your looking for an awesome coffee shop experience look no further then lux and if you don't have a car don't worry. Theres a lightrail stop right in front of it.",

It's a coffee shop mixed with a wine bar, what more could you possibly ask for in one place?  Yes, parking is crazy, and yes, it is always packed, but once you find a seat, you often get lost in the people watching and the free iced tea refills and end up spending hours there. The reason it's always so packed is because the desserts are divine, as well as the breakfast, lunch, and dinner they make. Not to mention iced coffee refills are only $1. I've never not enjoyed whatever I've ordered there.  I've always noticed great service from the employees. Whenever I bring my cup back for a fifth or sixth refill of hibiscus iced tea (it's somewhat of an addiction), they gladly refill it for me. Although it's always packed and there's typically always a line, the employees keep their cool and try to serve everyone in a timely manner.  Whether you're looking for a place to meet with a friend, to study, to do work, or just to decompress after a long day, Lux is the place to go. I'd give it six stars if I could (mostly because free iced tea refills are awesome).",

Nice relaxed vibe, people on their laptops sipping way too slow and friendly knowledgeable staff willing to assist you in your choice of brews. Then, you too can sit for way too long and check your email on your phone while you isolate from the world. Or better, bring a friend and chat.",

The Croissants are to die for, but they don't come out of the oven until after 6:30 AM.   During the summer, what is better than Iced Coffee? Hmmm.. the way Lux makes it- every Iced coffee is an Iced Americano with an extra shot of espresso. Couldn't get better.",

I'm a huge fan of the Americano here, not bitter at all and the espresso is pulled nice and strong.  Chocolate chip cookie sandwich to die for, but get a beverage to cut the sweetness. I've had brownies, cake, lemon bars and cookies. I haven't encountered anything at Lux I haven't loved. WAIT THEY ALSO HAVE COCKTAILS.

    "text": "When you think of the great coffee shops of Arizona one name sticks out above the rest... Lux. The word lux actually refers to illuminating light and this place just lights up central Phoenix like nobody's business. So it seems that when naming this grand coffee shop, the owners knew what they were doing. Now in order to have a successful and popular coffee shop, many aspects come into play. First and foremost, the coffee must be outstanding... you could have all the other important parts such as great ambiance, food, space, parking or free wifi... but if your coffee is no good, the people will go elsewhere.  This place happens to have it all! from the moment you either park on the street or on the lot, you know you're headed to the gem of the neighborhood. There are ALWAYS people here... that is the first sign of feeling the reassurance of going to the right place. as you walk through the entrance, the aroma of the ground coffee beans just invades your senses and your body just feels that \"I am at home\" comfort level.  The set up in this place is pretty sweet. Spread all throughout this coffee house are seperated rooms full of varried couches, benches, sofas, chairs, tables and work areas. This place is suited for everyone from the student to the professional and from the reader to the social butterfly. In one of the rooms, there is even a tv which they play sports on for the hipster fan :)  Straight back from where you walk in, there is the barristas' counter joined by the small exposition kitchen. They have fresh pastries available as well as fresh fruit, eggs, etc. They seem to have a bit of something light or heavy for everyone. As for the most important part of this venue, the coffee, they seemed to have come close to perfection with their blend of beans. Whether you order it black, mocha'ed, latte'ed, iced or hot... the flavor is never disappointing. What is also nice, are the variety of mixers for your coffee. They have soy, almond milk, low fat, skim, whole, etc. You name the drink and they shall make it. A traditional espresso drink has two shots but if you need that extra boost, they will happily upgrade you to the quad.  Now, in addition to the cafe part of this place there is a bar nestled in the back corner facing the entrance. If you are just not feeling the mood of coffee just the coffee house, one can order wine, boutique beer or even a refreshing cocktail. Not many modern day coffee shops have this additional amenity. It's nice to have the option when you are in a bit more relaxed and or social mood. The bartenders seem to have enough knowledge to concoct most drinks the average person can come up with, so don't hold back!  All in all, this place is doing it right. It all started with an idea that sprouted into this diamond in the desert. My only criticism is that this place is becomming SO popular, that it is almost losing that comfortable casual feel because of the crowd. My suggestion... open another location!!!!! :)",

If you want to be a pretentious Macbook Pro hipster to write your next novel, come here. If you want to chill out with friends and talk, come here. The atmosphere is dim and chill at night and they have inside and outside seating that's always bustling. Parking can be hard sometimes because this place is so good.  I had an order of hot chocolate and it was creamy and delicious. The barista drew a beautiful leaf design in the cream on top; if they day is slow, they'll take their time to show off their talents with detailed art that makes me not even want to drink it because I'll ruin it. I love details like that.   Their mac 'n cheese dish is made and baked perfectly and everything is served in big coffee cups that make you feel at home. The music they play there is very different and not Top 40 which is something I always appreciate. The experience is delightful and I would recommend this place for sure!",

I'm not sure where all the negative buzz regarding employee attitudes came from when reading previous reviews, as my experience was great. I ordered the house dark roast coffee and breakfast of eggs and bacon. Coffee was perfection and breakfast didn't disappoint. I will make a point to visit again when I am in the area.",

I've had the carrot cake, choc chip blondie, m and m cookie, etc etc. apple something, salted caramel something else...and each time I make the remark.. \"I could literally crush every last one of those f-ing desserts and never look back\".  Scary good.. Soft... Insane.  Second, the sugar free caramel latte iced or hot with the dope leaf design in the foam- thumbs up.  Sizes are one stage smaller than most places but I'll take it if it lets them stay open and profitable.   Oh ya open late!!!!! Till midnight thru the week and 2 on the weekends.  Finally!

Go to Lux for the amazing coffee and wifi, but come away with an appreciation for great spaces, new friends, and a quiet buzz that'll make you want to come back again and again.  The \"new\" Lux is a great space: once you think you've found a quiet place to crawl into and observe the crowd, you'll discover that the building just continues and continues! There's a spot to people watch, enjoy the football game that's on, or power through your emails at a large table. If you're not in the mood to stay inside, hit up the small patio and listen to the chatter around you.   If coffee isn't your thing, order wine or beer! I haven't tried their food but just from the looks of the dishes that friends have ordered, I don't think you can go wrong. The only thing that keeps Lux from getting five stars? It's crazy overpriced! Their cheapest glass of wine is $9.   All in all, go to Lux just for the experience. I promise you won't regret it.",

They are are, first and foremost, a coffee shop. And, time and time and time again, they deliver a premium, tasty, excellent cup of coffee. Whats more? it's 2 bucks. 2 american dollars for a - get this - endless cup of brew. And that's all I ever really want, a quality cup of coffee all hours of the day.   That being said, it's can be difficult to get past the occasional worker who seems to be unhappy all the time, or the barista who doesn't seem to have enough time to even look you in the eye.

I saw the sign/billboard, but only saw the italian restaurant. Thankfully i wandered the correct direction. I walked in and the entrance is actually the side of the shop (if there is another oops). i was a little confused but made my way through, knowing i was in the correct location because everyone had coffee cups, iced and hot. I found the \"menu\" on a glass written with liquid chalk (love it). and pastries all over!   The pastry choices were plentiful, finding where to order a little difficult, because it looked like it was part of the pastry \"display table\". i'd come back i like the atmosphere a lot + it's next to slippery pig bike shop!",

But if u want to hang with your friends, do some light work, or people-watch, then I would definitely recommend!! Great coffee, fun atmosphere and Lux never fails to entertain when it comes to people watching.   I've only been there 3, maybe 4 times, but every time I've been there i was very entertained lol. My first visit included a large group of rowdy, and slightly racist, santa clauses. And every visit since then has been just as entertaining.   I know some people who go there often to study, and I could never see myself doing that because there's just so much going on around you that it makes it a little hard to concentrate, but if u prefer that kind of environment when your studying or need a spark of creativity for your writing, Lux is a great stop!",

    "text": "Lux is a rare gem in the otherwise homogenized coffee shop scene which permeates the greater Phoenix metro. A haven for the \"hipster\" and \"indie\" crowds, it is frequently populated with would be iconoclasts who, if you move past the stereotypes usually cast upon such people, are largely friendly and unpretentious.  The service is earnest and talented producing some of the best cappucinos, americanos and other assorted caffeinated beverages in town. The various baked goods are reasonably priced and obviously crafted with care providing stark contest to the mass-produced crap most coffee shops sling with something like disdain for their customers.  I only hesitate to award the fifth star for lack of experience with the other offerings of food and drink they offer. An omission to my experience I hope to soon include.  EDIT: Since I never got around to posting this review after my first visit and subsequently visited numerous times I can confirm this to be a five-star establishment. In addition to the quality coffee beverages they offer their bar was (and likely still is) quite well stocked and competently tended. They offer a very solid selection of quality liquors and beers (can't speak confidently to their wine selection, I'm not much for the vino). Their meals are often exquisite and understated, though not exactly cheap. All told I definitely consider this and Copper Star to sit alone atop the Phoenix coffee throne.",

    "text": "Things I like in a coffee house...  1. Oddly, not coffee. I really am not a coffee person which leads me to...  2. Tea. I like tea. Tea and me are friends and when the barrista/o knows just as much about his teas as he does his coffees, then I am always impressed.  3. FREE wifi. I've been traveling a lot lately and I never really appreciated the beauty of free wifi til recently. You get ripped off at hotels, airports, etc, so when a place like this doesn't charge you to chill and enjoy your time here while surfing for midget porn, then I am very grateful.  4. Good people watching. Let's face it. I observe people for a living. I don't technically get paid for this, but I do it and so, I require a nice amount of characters to check out. Last night offered a dude wearing sunglasses...at night, along with two gay guys on a first date. Always VERY entertaining to watch someone else's awkward encounter unfold. \"So, where did you go to elementary school?\" \"I hate when coffee is too strong!\" \"yada yada yada.\" (PS, they left to go for a \"walk\" so maybe it did go well)  5. A cool bathroom. I know this may seem odd, but I love cool bathrooms and loathe gross ones. There is no middle ground for me. Sadly, Lux falls into the latter and it was guuross! The attempt at art is...interesting though, and by interesting I mean, not so much, but hey, at least it distracts you from looking around at the wet floor and paper towel explosions and dirty counters.  So how does Lux weigh in on my 5 list. I think at a solid 3.5. Overall, the atmosphere was a tad sterile for my taste. I generally prefer really cozy couches and warm tones and cool lighting instead of white walls and somewhat fluorescent lighting. But the white tea was damn tasty, so I gotta give it up for that :)",

Their homemade whipped cream is amazing, so I often open for the quad-shot con pana to light me up. It's fantastic.  Next up, friendly, smart staff. They always seem extra happy, which may be the constant buzz from the espresso and whipped cream rushes I am sure they cruise on all day.  Cap it off with tasty pastries, nice vibe and decor, and it is one of my favorite coffee shops in town.  The only downside at all is that it's popularity can make it crazy busy, so if you're looking to sit and relax or work for a bit, get there eeeeeeearly.",

Lux has a primo location, next to Pane Bianco, just off a train station, and in a great neighborhood. They have a great patio which they share with Bianco, that even though it is loud, it is a nice spot to hang out.   Their coffee prices are more than fair, $2 for a large coffee, and decent tasting. The biggest thing was not having to pay additional tax, as they have worked it into the prices. I never realized how angry it makes me when something is like $2.03 and I have to walk around with a pocketful of change all day. So those are all the plusses, but I've had a few negative reports as well.  This may or may not be normal, but on my visit, it was a like an akward library. They did not have any music on, there was little to no conversation between customers, and it was very quiet. I also couldn't get past the blatant violation of fire code on the way to the restroom. They had piles and stacks of dishes in the hallway and I almost bowled one of them over because someone decided to try to pass me while I was next to one.",

They usually pretentiously tell me to get it myself, as if I'm the only person who forgot to read the LUX Etiquette Handbook, Vol,4.  Im ok with getting it myself, thats all good.  But then the next time I go, i try to get it myself and an employee cuts me off as i attempt to open the fridge and says:   \"Uhhh, can I help you?\"    I say, \"well, last time they told me to get the soda myself?\"     She says, \"Only when we're busy\"  Yet it was more busy then than the previous time.   So to all the lux regulars, how many people is considered busy, or is there some other way in determining this.  Also, i always ask for whipped cream.  Half the time they put it on, half the time they don't.  Thats too bad because the whipped cream is amazing.  Last note, the arrogance, pretentiousness, self-obsessed, elitist vibe is uncanny.  Not the physical place, but the people.  If you don't walk in with a with that certain \"I know good coffee and I'm special\"  attitude, they stare at you like an alien.  Oh, and you have to have a mac laptop too.  But i will still continue to go here because they have the best coffee.  Oh well.",

They know exactly what they are. They don't try to be anything else. They do an amazing job of executing every part of who they are.  First of all, the coffee rocks. They roast their own beans and are our favorite in town. Then the drinks they make are not only delicious but also beautiful. So many nice touches. Latte art. Homemade whipped cream with a touch of  honey. Sugared rim & slice of lemon on the lemonade. Fresh squeezed juices. McClendon Farms honey as a condiment. They serve their drinks in china & glass (cool non-institutional mugs & glasses) if you're drinking there. They even have killer lids for their to go coffee. Their straws are super thick & you never have to worry about them getting crimped.  If it didn't all taste good, I guess it wouldn't matter. But it does & every little aspect adds to the experience for me.  Same with their food. Great snacks. Served on china. Heated & served with a slab of real butter if it's supposed to be.  Cool decor. Changing local art on the walls. Great music playing. Free wifi.  The only thing that bugs me at all about Lux is how crowded it's become. In the scheme of things, I guess that's good because we know Lux will be around & it also says a lot for the taste of Phoenicians.  I have heard one other criticism - that the folks there can be snooty. I myself have never seen that & experienced the absolute opposite time after time. I often come with 2 little kids too so I'd expect if anybody was going to get the snoot, it'd be me.  I just plain love Lux. If it were closer to my house, I'd be there even more.",

I met bonnie here pre-Chez Nous HH (that turned into evening since I got off work late) because my coffee shop connoisseur friend was posting up there until I got off work down the street. I admit I am directionally challenged to degree that is not only embarrassing, but debilitating. If you feel for me, take heed - I drove past it not once but two times. Add to that the light rail construction (it is right on central) and my post-work brain just about exploded. Poor bonnie had to take three calls from me before going out to the street to wave me in like an airplane.  But, once safely in the parking lot, there were ample spaces and I was surprised to see that pane bianco was right next door! Then it all made sense - why that phoenix cool-baby marketing rep asked me a date here, why so many people that I would not imagine know about these kinds of things seem to love talking about lux. It's right next door to prob one of the busiest/coolest places to pick up sandwiches for up-and-coming downtowners (uptowners?).   Well, although bianco was long-closed, lux was happenin' at 7 at night. there was plenty of comfy seating (two couches, and easily 7 or 8 arm chairs) plus a long table seemingly designated for setting up laptops. The staff seemed friendly and nice, and I really liked that the shelves for placing flyers was inset into the counter where you order - still visible but not at all the messy eyesore they inevitably end up being.  Ok, now for my favorite part - the clipboards that hang on stings against the wall so that patrons can hang their own sketches, drawings, paintings - whatever. (miss bonnie herself added a RAD sketch of a sexy bunny-man, I suggest you check it out).  Sorry to say I did not taste the coffee or the treats, so I can't speak to that. But, I would most definitely go back to do so.",

From the modern, eclectic aesthetics to the masterfully prepared drinks (including the yummy homemade, scoop-able whipped cream!) and the laid-back staff, Lux is always a treat.   A life-long Phoenician, I've always had the \"stay away from strangers\" mentality. When I first went to Lux I was dismayed that even at a \"slow\" time I was forced to sit either on the same couch or at the same table as a stranger. Now I have assimilated to the environment that provides ample opportunity to easily strike up a conversation with fellow Lux-goers. Thank you Lux for melting this cold-stranger-averse exterior!   The only reason I cannot give Lux 5 stars is the lack of outdoor comforts. The picnic-style tables stand in stark contrast to the comfortable seats and atmosphere found indoors. On a beautiful spring/fall night (which I can only dream of at this time of year), I want to sit outdoors in comfortable seats, with a good cup of coffee and enjoy great conversation. Work with me Lux!   In summation, if you like great coffee (or yummy baked goods!) and a fun, energetic atmosphere, Lux is the place for you. :)",

And the pastries that are made in the back make every trip memorable.     a.a is right bring a laptop if you want to be one with Lux.    I found the service to be very friendly and there is not a high rate of turnover, the baristas know what their doing.    Don't let the light rail construction stop you from a visit the place is worth it.",

Its a great place to meet friends for coffee or to sit on the sofa with your laptop.  Awesome atmosphere.  I could sit there for hours listening to the music.  They offer an assortment of delicious baked goods.  On the plus side Pane Bianco is right next door.  Best place to grab a sandwich.",

The coffee is great, the service is quick and unpretentious, music is (almost) always good, and there is just no better place to settle in with a book or laptop for an hour or two.    They also always have the most delicious pies/cakes/muffins.  The only complaint I have is that it would be nice if they carried some \"savories\"... breads, rolls, pasta salads, or maybe even sandwiches.",

There are a lot of 20 somethings that regular here with their iBooks and headphones, but there are still just as many people socializing. It is crowded, but with lots of good seating. There is an area with great comfy chairs and leather couches. There are also ample tables to keep your laptop on. The walls are littered with interesting local, contemporary art.   Half the time I'm here I take my headphones off because I enjoy the music they play so much. They even have a pitcher of free lemon ice water. :)",

    "text": "What I like best about Lux is the excellent coffee and great music/DJ.  I used to enjoy the interesting and happy, laid back crowd of people that tended to flock to Lux to sip a coffee while working on their laptops or chatting for a while over a dessert.    For some reason- is it the larger meals?  the alcohol?  the bigger more comfortable seats?  the typewriters?  the extra bathroom?- the new Lux draws a totally different demographic... mostly over 40 and under 5.  Think yoga pants or church dresses... with a bunch of poorly behaved kids yelling \"Mom, Mom, Mom, Mom.... DAD!\", running, and twirling around in a crowded space with adults carrying full-to-the brim coffee cups.  Or worse, the screaming infants of hipster (or used to be) parents who can't let go... they honestly think they can remain cool by sitting on the couch sipping Velvets while the entire place is subjected to their bawling infants whom they expect everyone to find adorable.  Really??!  It IS mildly entertaining to watch the interaction between the burgeoning \"family\"/senior citizen/Christian Sunday morning crowd (\"Liam, sit down, honey.  Liam, Liam, Liam... stop that, Liam.  Stop licking the nice lady's scone.... it's not yours. LIAM!\") with the fit, handsome gay men, the brilliantly overweight and pierced/tattooed lesbians, pseudo business people, and liberal graduate students.    Younger/trendy crowd seems to get drinks to go now.  Those who stay are ogled by mid lifers who want to know all about your computer or your cell phone and have no qualms about interrupting your work for a free tech lesson.  You also run the risk of toddlers sipping from your straw if your drink is left on the table.    Or maybe you will enjoy being pushed out of the way by a 40 year old woman in yoga pants who simply MUST get her iced mocha right this second?  If not, you may want to get that coffee to go... quickly!    The Sunday DJ is amazing.  His music could be my \"church\".  So, it was sad that today I could only hear toddlers, soccer moms, etc. yelling over the music about nothing of importance or interest.  :-(  Lastly, the internet connection comes and goes, mostly goes.  I have to tether with my cell phone because the wifi drops every hour or so.",

This place looks cool and the baked goods look amazing! Unfortunately, it was so busy that by the time I got to see what they had to offer, I had to order right away. I didn't have a chance to decide, since most of the stuff is right before the register. The line was enormous and therefore, hid the items up for choosing. It's a spot where you must be a regular in order to know what to get. The chai was good and the quiche that I had was also tasty, but pretty small and not filling. I was still hungry after I ate it and didn't want to wait in line again. Overall, this place is really cool, but I don't feel like I got the full experience, since we were heading back to CA shortly after out visit to Lux. Maybe next time.",

There is a full bar, a lunch and dinner menu, delicious pastries (savory and sweet), and of course, amazing coffee. There are lots of partitioned rooms now so you can explore and see which room fits your mood best for the day. There is a quieter \"study\" dark room in the back, but attached to it is a large \"TV room\" where it seems more acceptable to be loud and to...breastfeed your child. I'm down with that...I guess.  Perhaps my favorite thing about Lux is the aloof personality of the owner Jeff, who is an actual genius underneath his outer layer of quirk, and one of the bartenders whose name I wish I knew...he wears glasses, is has brownish hair, tall and slender, and makes a mean cucumber lemon cocktail.

The coffee is great, any food choices I have had off the menu have been fantastic.  I love the hipster vibe, and there is always Plenty of parking. I don't live close by, but stop in anytime I'm in that part of the city.",

Basically, if you come from anywhere outside Arizona and are used to great coffee (and the thought of Starbucks appalls you), this is your place. Yes, it is packed and it takes a while to get your drink, but if you can go in an off-hour, it's the perfect place to sit down and enjoy a cup.",

Then figuring out where to order was a challenge as there are 2 areas that look like they could be ordering stations. Terrible service. The people that work there have an attitude. I ordered a coffee with whipped cream. They put maybe less than a tablespoon on top. So I asked for more. The woman looked at me and disappeared. I assumed she was getting more whip, she comes back and calls my name for my coffee. I'm already standing in front of her and I ask again for more and she leaves again this time comes back with the whip and puts less than a teaspoon on. Needless to say the whip was amazing but why be stingey with it?! The coffee tasted watered down.",

Last night I went and the female that took our order was out there and drinks that they had listed on the menu were not available.  Then I get to the register and I get some punk who is rude AF threw the receipt and my card to me and never engaged at all with his stuck up demeanor.  The majority of the staff are a bunch of stuck up rude youngsters that have zero manners and don't have a clue about customer service.  So go ahead and pay almost $6 dollars for coffee for some rude punks to serve you coffee.  Hope the owners see this post and give their staff training in regard to customer service and how to treat customers.",

After fighting our way through the crowd we were able to join the line to order. Fortunately it went quickly and when our drinks were ready, so was a couch so we were able to sit and enjoy the experience. You obviously go to Lux for the experience as it is a perfect people watching place. There is an eclectic mix of young adults who are either studying or using their computers or phones to stay on top of the most recent social events.  And, by the way, there is also a bar crowd as well as Lux also has a full bar. If this is your type of establishment you will love this place, if not, just enjoy your coffee.",

I still ultimately love most things about this cafe and have probably been here more times then I can remember.  The reason behind the dropped star is that I've noticed that the workers can be a bit short and the food a bit too salty. Heavy seasoning hands on the chefs here. I ordered the Yorkshire Pudding Burger with Beet chips and though the Yorkshire pudding, aioli and beet chips were tasty the burger patty itself was too salty. The Yorkshire pudding seemed a bit too tough, kind of expected a more flaky texture and the patty cooked a bit over to my \"Medium Rare\" preference though stated during my order.  Alas, if there's one thing you should order here besides the pastries and other dishes on their changing menu it's their Mac & Cheese. It's not the nostalgic bright, orange Mac N Cheese that comes in a blue and yellow box ... but it is definitely next level. Perfectly cooked macaroni, creamy and gooey, melty cheese sauce. I also got mine with bacon and jalapenos, which gave it a bit of heat and a smokey, saltiness from the bacon.  Other than that, the drinks, pastries, well dressed folk, sociable people, table space, fast wi-fi and late hours of operation are still a win in my book.",

At 10am yesterday--Friday--it was packed and cacaphenous, so noisy and crowded.  We waited in line that moved quickly for just coffee and a latte.  It was crowded and everyone swuished up close.  Tables I side were all full but it was too crowded and loud in there anyway.  It's too rustic outside and please replace those tables and chairs and put them in tradinable places to sit.  I had on white pants and tables and chairs were not cleaned.  Very dirty in fact, if that is what one calls rustic. I take it this is a local hangout place.  No thank you.  Not teturning ever .  We'll hope the food and younger folks gave this place the high ratings.  Just say no",

The coffee was delicious, and we ordered a dessert, s'mores cake of sorts, ridiculously sweet, we couldn't finish it between 3 people, but we also ordered \"dessert\" coffee(white breve mochas extra sweet, so it may have been excessive just because of our beverage choice). It's hard to find signage on the outside. Makes it feel like an underground New York coffee house. The music was RAD and fit the ambience.  And it's super cute inside.  If you can find it, check it out. And don't order melted ice cream coffee if you're getting a dessert. I felt like I was testing my fate while aggressively flirting with diabetes.",

No.  I did get a raspberry thumbprint cookie which was REALLY good though, and all of their baked items looked delicious. I highly recommend getting something with your coffee, even if you have to eat it later. The atmosphere was as described - 'cozy' and with lots of character if not a whole lot of places to stand while waiting for your drink.  It is a good place to sit and chat, as there is lots of seating alcoves.  It was little crowded when I went (Thursday afternoon), but the staff had the flow down and the wait wasn't bad. I won't be driving cross town just to get a cup though, but I might stop in again if I'm in the area.",

But it also had the buzz in the air as your typical vibrate coffee shop (1 star). I had a cold mocha, and it was served in an environmental friendly cup (1 star). The mocha was delicious and made to perfection (1 star). The seating was abundant, with many choices (couches, long tables, community tables, bar seating, etc.) (1 star). 4 stars!

I like the decor, the music is usually quite good as they play mostly indie, and the patrons who come here have been quite nice. The silly, trifling, pretentious goons aren't here anymore, or maybe they've stayed away. The servers are nicer and more helpful, and that's pretty important, too.

Meh.  A bit small of an iced coffee for $4.50.  I know its \"higher quality\" made by an \"artisan\", but I much prefer my Dunkin Donuts iced coffee for under $2.00.  They give you your cup, and then you have to cream and sugar it yourself at their little table.  The coffee was pretty tasty, but it was skimp.

The baked goods look great, but I wished they had something vegan to indulge in, and there are plenty of other coffee shops that do accommodate that need. They may have had something that was vegan but they were so busy and rushing me to order that I didn't feel comfortable taking the time to ask. The coffee itself is good, but overall I just wouldn't go out of my way to sit amidst the huge crowd that is always there. But hey, huge crowd means tons of other people love it, so to each their own!",

Taxes are now passed on to its customers without lowering prices to compensate for the newly added tax. Why not just call it how it is, Lux raised their prices. $6 and some change for large iced mocha is becoming a little excessive.",

Which was so soft, the cream cheese topping was so creamy. The roll to icing ratio was perfect. We also ordered mac and cheese and the bacon cheeseburger. The food is made to order, and very generous portions.   For drinks, we had a dirty chai, chai latte and the arnold palmer. All three drinks were awesome, flavorful and made to order as well. I definitely recommend this place if you're looking for a good local shop, with great food and a chill atmosphere. Can't wait to gl back!",

The music played in the space is more like club music than it is study music. And boy is it blaring. The food looks good, but don't be fooled. It's very expensive. Drinks are good but comparable to others in the area. Ample seating at least. Plenty of places to recharge your electronics (but mainly your headphones because you'll need to use them at full volume).  The music has got to go. Once it does, I'd be happy to post a more positive review.",

We've been here on weekends and during the week. The low rating is because of one particular employee. I don't know her name, but she's tall and has light hair. Personally, she is quite rude to put it nicely. She ignores you when you ask a question, acts annoyed when you order something, and seems to prefer to stand there with a blank stare while others are working crazy around her. Maybe she's a supervisor, but if so, that makes it worse because in my opinion good customer service starts and stops with good leadership. Again, their food is amazing, but she's making it so that if I come in and see she's working, I likely will turn around and take my business elsewhere to not have to deal with her.",

I came by and nearly left because the posted address goes to an office and the entrance around back appeared to be for another restaurant. Eventually we found our way, but it's a douche move to intentionally limit your patronage to those \"in the know\".  But goddamn if the coffee and desserts aren't the best I came across in the greater Phoenix area. The Lux salted cookie sandwich and a cappuccino made an incredible dessert that had me eating my words about this place being a bunch of pretentious, artsy bullshit. I mean, it is, but I guess if you have the skills to back it up, you can get away with it. The barista who helped me was friendly enough, but some sort of organization to the ordering system should be appreciated, as it was mostly a herd of people standing in front of the registers until they were summoned by staff.   Great late-night stop to catch up with friends over drinks or sweet treats. Snag a copy of their cute-ass menu with vintage drawings and old-school dining specials. Outdoor seating available, since indoors is limited and smoke-free. Were their holiday hours not limited, we would have made the 10 mile trek out of our way to visit again before leaving town. Will make a point of returning when I'm back in a few months.",

Y'all are loved by all and so indie and hipster, it hurts. Lux has 1,500+ reviews with a high rating but I'm keepin' it real: You guys need to take it down a notch with the attitude.  Oh, you guys are artsy? Well I graduated from the Art Institute. You don't see me being all pretentious. You guys are being extra and without the delightful service.    They made my hot chocolate with regular milk instead of almond and instead of apologizing and making it right away (come on... it's heated milk and pumps of Ghirardelli chocolate syrup here. You're not exactly melting chocolate bars!), you give it to my friend and made me wait while you prepared other people's drinks that were ordered after me.   The hot cocoa was some standard Ghirardelli goodness and my peanut cake was pretty good. Sadly my gal pals' cupcakes were as dry as the air.   So whatever. Scorn me all you want, Yelpers. I'll only be back in if I'm in the neighborhood. I do appreciate the late hours of operation.",

The second time I came it was on a weekend and of course, it was busy. The only seats my husband and I found were these beaten up lounge chairs in a corner with holes in them. We were sitting next to these speakers overhead that was blaring Spanish music while we could hear indie music simultaneously blaring in the next little room over. I sat there waiting for someone to move so I can relocate.......but everyone here seemed to be college kids with their laptops and books, hunkered down for hours upon hours of studying. The bathroom is located in a weird nook where they store things and the bathroom was always busy. On the bright side, the soap in the restroom smelled very good. The layout of the cafe is very confusing. I didn't understand the distinction between the different rooms and felt like space could be better conserved with an open concept design. The entrance is kind of hard to find, but this doesn't prevent the large crowds",

Hearing that it has a lot of great tasting options we decided to come here.   I must say it was quite hard to find since we didn't see any logos or anything that suggested this building was Lux, we kinda went in blind.   Coming in, you definitely get the hipster vibe, which is cool, everything is esthetically pleasing, the atmosphere is chill, just meant for you to relax. I dig it.   Coming up to the counter, the gentleman was nice and made sure to greet us, we ordered 2 Ghirardelli hot chocolates (yum) and a vanilla latte (also yum). We picked up 2 cup cakes as well, vanilla vanilla and chocolate espresso. The barista  got my friends hot chocolate wrong, whole milk instead of almond -1 star. I saw a peanut butter cake and recommended it to bestie Joyce W. (Queen of PB). So to make sure she asked the cashier if it was peanut butter cake or frosting, the gal replied with \"oh, it's peanut butter something\". -1 star, woah girl, you should know a little more about your job and customer service.   The drinks were delightful, keeping us warm as we chit chatted and caught up. The pastries on the other hand, were dry and crumbling to touch. The treat were displayed open on plates behind a glass, no covering or anything preventing them from being exposed to air. I'll say it's fair game that it was 10pm and end of the day so I'll let Lux keep that star.   It was a fun and popular place to stop by, and try out, but I definitely think I can find another spot with equally delicious drinks, less of a crowd and hopefully better service.",

First off, the coffee is really good, which is obviously the most important thing you look for in a coffee place. But Lux was so much more than that. They had an incredible baked goods selection (the apple tart was delicious), a full menu of interesting foods, a mixologist on staff, and even a live DJ. That's right, a DJ, and I went on a friday afternoon.   I went for lunch so I got the dutch pancake with potatoes, broccoli, spinach, cauliflower, topped with cheese. It was one of the most unique meals I've ever had but also one of the best lunches I've ever had.   There was a good amount of seating, both outside and inside. Was the place hipster? Of course. Everyone had been mentioning that in their reviews. I haven't been able to figure out why white dudes with dreads and gauges makes coffee and food better but it does. That being said, Lux is not in short supply of said hipsters. And everything is unbelievable.",

If you're in the mood for something sweet, they will have something baked that will hit the spot. AND if you're in there later in the day, and need something filling, order their mac n cheese, and you won't be disappointed!   It does get crowded in here, often, which can make finding seating a bit difficult, but don't let that sway your decision to come.  I highly recommend coming in if you have never been.",

I ordered the Egg sandwich and a caramel latte both were very good and the prices were not bad. I was very happy that they offer both almond and soy milk as an option.

It is pretty ridiculous making me hesitate to go back. There is always a line out the door, parking issues, and nowhere to sit. If you can snag a seat it is on a couch or hanging off a bar stool so rather hard to eat and awfully uncomfy.   Today, I ordered the Dutch Pancake. I did not like the burnt top part of the pancake. My friend says the last time she ordered it it was not burnt like that and tasted better. The unburnt part was Delish though but at 10 bucks it should be perfect! You can get it with fruit or veggies. My friend got the biscuits and gravy which I loved. Not too heavy or salty with a hint of Sage.   Pros- Good food, fun vibe, cool decor, music, friendly folks, best coffee drinks in town I dare to say.   Cons, Wowza this place is expensive, packed to the gills every time I have come, and Panne Bianco is right next door causing an eating choice dilemma -lol   I am sure there must be an off time here to go to avoid the crowds. if you know what that time is let me know. Also, I can always solve one of the dilemmas by eating here and getting Panne to go when the weather cools off. Granted, this could only happen if the second mortgage for food cost that day comes through, ha!   ;)",

We have been there two previous times when the oven was down. It's a neat spot, order at the counter and find your own seat. The only downside is checking back to see if your food is fine as they leave it on the back counter and it gets crowded and loud there at times. They have amazing pastries, breads, and cookies tho!",

I asked one of the guys if I can move one of the chairs so that my friend and I could sit together, but he was no help. He told me he don't know and moved on. The latte was good and even better because there was cute art to go along with it. That made me happy.

There was a long wait on the coffee side, but you can also order food and drinks at the bar side. We really wanted to try the Yorkshire pudding burger but they were out! Instead I ordered a brown rice dish with chicken and vegetables, jalapeno bacon mac & cheese, and a squash soup. Even though there were about 10 of us, we were able to find a spot on one of the benches.   The interior design was really trendy, hipster and retro. It was as though I was in someone's basement. The table was adorned with baskets of oranges and functional  old-school type writers. You can also sit at these chairs with tables stacked with books. A very unique vibe. It reminded me much of Valley Bar.  The food came out fairly quickly. I ordered way too much food, but it was really tasty and delicious like comfort food. Everyone that works here is super friendly which is a huge bonus. I also enjoyed watching the cooks prepare their food right in front of everyone. Totally candid, unfiltered.",

It's close to Midnight on a Sat night and I'm a coffee drinking fool and am always into finding a local coffee shop, found out Lux is opened to 2am on Friday & Saturday nights, that's pretty sweet to me.  I read the board and saw espresso macchiato so that's what I ordered & asked if they could add caramel to it and she told me I will get a caramel latte.  Ok I'm getting the caramel latte then.   My coffee order was up, and I have to say I'm pleased with the presentation, very swanky, and the latte itself was good, the creamy froth stayed though out the entire drink, you know how sometimes it fades away, not here, it was frothy creamy all the way to the last drop.  I enjoyed it very much.  Now I just wish Lux was closer to me, I could see myself coming here often if it was.",

    "text": "I got to Lux around 8:30 am on Saturday morning and it was already packed with people. It was so packed that the cashier did not see that I was in line.  After I ordered they told me to go find a seat and they will call my name out at the counter when the coffee was ready. It was so crowded that it was difficult to find a space to sit, however, I finally found a seat near the bar at the high tables. After waiting for about 7-10 minutes for my coffee (while going back to check every few minutes), I found a cup of coffee waiting on the counter. I had not heard my name called because it was so crowded and loud inside. I actually ended up spilling my coffee when going back to my sitting area as it was so crowded. At that point I decided to pack up and leave as it was too loud to do any work. By the time I left (a span of about 15-20 minutes) the line to order was almost to the door.  I do have to make a note and thank the woman who worked at Lux who helped me clean up my spilled coffee and gave me all of my to-go containers for my scone and what was left of the coffee I ordered.  So as you can see, I was not a fan of the atmosphere. As for the coffee, I was able to salvage some of it after I spilled it. I had ordered a medium latte and it wasn't too bad. Not the best I've had however. I also ordered a bacon cheddar scone. That was very delicious.  Overall, I was not impressed with this coffee shop considering all of the high reviews it got. I will not be coming back.",

As soon as I walk in, I noticed the large display of baked goods. I wanted the mixed berry muffin SOOOOO bad, but I am trying to stay away from sugar right now so I passed :( I ordered an Americano and it was quite delicious. Wish I could've stayed to lounge around a big on the big comfy yellow couch, but I had to leave for work.   High recommend! I want to go back for more hipster yummy goodness!",

I love the layout, the decor, the staff, the coffee and bar drinks, their baked goods - at least I did until I tried the cookies. They were not cheap ($1 a piece and not particularly large), but I believe in spending a bit more for small business's sake and good quality. That's why I was so disappointed. The coconut macaroons were so hard that they completely crumbled when biting into them. I am still not sure if they were just old or just poorly made. The pistachio divinity on the other hand so sweet that even I, who has never met a carbohydrate she has not liked, could not eat them. I picked out the pistachios and threw the rest away.  I still love Lux and I will be back - I just won't get the cookies.",

    "text": "Great stop in central Phoenix for some great coffee. I've been coming to Lux for a while now and have been pleasantly surprised with great coffee, food and customer service.  If you haven't been to Lux yet, please do so. Hidden away, it brings Phoenix phenomenal coffee. For breakfast, I recommend getting the quiche or the egg bake. When fall comes around make sure to get yourself a pumpkin whoopie pie (you'll thank me later).   Every time I have been it has been packed- yet all the staff are friendly and very accommodating. But the biggest reason I decided to write this review was not even based on the iced-coffee or the yummy pastries.  Yesterday, after leaving Lux I realized I had lost my set of keys. I decided to call Lux to see if I had left them behind. Elena answered the phone and I told her my situation. Not only was she kind, she also went around Lux while on the phone with me to search for my keys. She even went to the parking lot and tried to find them there. I was pleasantly surprised with her thoughtfulness to search for my keys for me. Though she wasn't able to find them while I was on the phone with her-she assured me that she would call me back if anything came up. She also proceeded to tell me to have a good day and good luck finding my keys.  So thank you Elena, for restoring my faith in humanity and for being such a kind individual. Make sure you all leave a tip for my girl Elena!",

It is terrrribly, painfully hip, but somehow it isn't uncomfortable there, and there really isn't a snide vibe that I have detected in my billion visits (oh and I would have).  I stopped going for a while prior to the big move because it was constantly packed, with lines out the door and internet speed that was reminiscent of mid-90s dial-up.  I rediscovered how much I liked making french-pressed coffee at home.  I've been around, coffee-wise, and Lux is always the best.  In fact, I'm so used to Lux, that when I get a crappy drink somewhere else, I assume that something out of the ordinary has happened, because it is so bad.  Repeat visits to offending spots (Lola, Lucy's) has confirmed that, no, they didn't make a mistake - they just suck.  Also, Lux's whipped cream is TO DIE.  I don't even like whipped cream, but you should see what happens when they forget to add it.",

I love places that look cool without looking like they tried too hard.  I was actually concerned because places like this usually have baristas that think they're too good for you.  This place was different!  The cashier immediately sparked up a cute witty banter and suggested their house specialties.  We went with one vanilla latte (my standard) and a Black and White latte which mixes dark and white chocolate.  Both were really amazing.  Another cool aspect is their little in house bakery.  On your way down the hall to the restrooms, you can sneak a peak at where they smelt up their decadent baked goods.  It looks so fun! I wanted to ask her if she needed any help!   Well, at least I got to take part in eating the final product...Peanut Butter Cookies!!",

Industrial decor with local artists' work somehow manages to be welcoming and not gritty, as can often be the case with indie coffee bars. It's not extremely bright inside, for those coming with books in hand, but it's a great space overall.   Secondly, the coffee is great and the pastries are fan-freaking-tastic. Just the thought of the sweet (cupcakes!) and the savory (feta and sun dried tomato scone!) options makes my mouth water. Sometimes I wish that they ventured into sandwiches, though they don't really seem to have the kitchen space.   The service I've gotten has always been friendly and impeccable, and I've gotten into conversations with the baristas many times.   I often go there to work on my laptop because working remotely in your parents' house isn't entirely productive. The music, yes, can be a little loud, which can impede productivity, but it's generally good music, so thumbs up overall. The wifi is free but on the slow side, so don't expect blazing speeds. I've never had much trouble finding a seat, but I only come in to sit during afternoons and evenings. It's a pretty good place to meet people, too!  All in all, I love Lux and wish it were still just blocks away.",

    "text": "HIP ATMOSPHERE, HEALTH CONCERNS - Just for me to say it is has a \"hip atmosphere\" should tell you how unhip I am. But the folks who frequent here, self excluded, are right out of central casting: if you wear disc earlobe rings, a sleeve tattoo, a retro t-shirt with a Tarantino movie poster en espanol and checkered pants, you will fit right in. Coffee was bold and served on real china. Unfortunately, one concern tainted the experience: I witnessed about 30 to-go paper cups be knocked to the floor by a clumsy employee and be picked up and set next to clean to-go cups ready to be used. They should have promptly placed the fallen cups in the recycling bin, but I guess that would be unhip. I alerted the same employee who knocked the cups down in the first place but she said \"don't worry, but thank you for your concern\" shaking her head in a most sarcastic way. \"You're welcome\" I replied with equal sarcasm in my voice. I'll just share this with millions of Yelp users, I thought. Lux management  - last I checked, sanitation in a restaurant environment is still so hip.",

I'm not even anywhere near Lux when I do stay in Phx, but I make the 20-something mile drive out there just to enjoy their iced lattes.   The prices are right in line with what I'm used to in NYC, but I suppose some in AZ might get sticker shock. It's SOOO worth the price though! I always order their iced soy latte with just half a packet of sweet n low, with whipped cream on top ($4.25), and HOLY CRAP, best thing ever. No idea how they do it.   The whipped cream here is prooooobably the best thing I've ever tasted, like, ever. I can't rave about it enough. But when you put it on top of a perfectly sweetened, creamy, icy, doesn't-even-really-taste-like-coffee beverage, it's heaven.   I asked the staff how they make their espresso so damn good, and they said they don't do anything different; they say it's most likely the roasting machines that have been \"seasoned\" with so much use that makes it so good.   Also-pastries are great, never had a bad one. The cookies are soft and chewy and yummy! Love the vibe of this place too, very loungy and laid back, with lots of people working on their laptops.   i almost always combine a trip here with one to Pane Bianco, and you're allowed to eat your sandwich inside Lux which is awesome. I'm not sure if they force you to buy something from them to eat in there, but I can't resist either way and always end up buying something anyway.   If you live anywhere NEAR Lux, you need to get your butt over there and try their whipped cream and espresso ASAP!",

I don't pretend to be a coffee snob but I am an addict and this place makes the best lattes and coffee of any place I've ever been. The pastries are unreal and baked in house with love.   They recently opened their new addition and restaurant and I have to say that they have made a True iconic mark in downtown Phoenix. The menu is limited right now but everything we were served was great. Of course they still maintain their coffee house vibe and have sacrificed nothing in that area with the renovation.   This place is a must visit in Phoenix!",

A busy urban coffee shop, lots of people chatting, working, studying,  a display of pastries. They even serve lunch/dinner, a bar.    I got the white chocolate latte,  my husband got the caramel latte, and a chocolate chip cookie, and an almond raspberry pastry i believe. The lattes had beautifull art on them, were serverd at a perfect temperature,  were smooth and delicious. The pastries were also great.   I wish they had another location  in scottsdale, however i will return to their current location.",

We all know the coffee and sweets are great but my real reason for writing is that I started eating the food recently... and it's phenomenal.  Obviously, not a huge menu, but there are only a few places in town that make really great inventive salads, and I'm kind of a snob.  I don't need a lot of choices as long as they're all good.  I have had 2 salads at Lux now and both of them were THE BEST.   My friend had the steak and it was better than the one he had ordered a couple nights prior at a steakhouse.  Almost silly.   PS.  I've got quite possibly the lamest (non existent) sense of style ever, but I'm not sure what people are talking about when they speak of \"hipster sneer\".  I get it... people who take their hip fashion trends seriously make you uncomfortable.. that's ok... just let them be, I promise that if they're being rude to you it's probably because you seem like a jerk and are giving off a bad vibe, not because they are super angry that you would step foot into their favorite establishment.  Like I said, my style sucks, and I go there all the time.  Stop caring so much what people seem to think of you.",

I generally come for breakfast, but have done dinner once and it was spot on. I had the burger on an english muffin. I was very impressed with the presentation, as well. The macaroni and cheese is spectacular. My girlfriend raves about the bacon and jalapeno mac, but all I can speak towards is the pesto one. Go try each. The menu doesn't say it, but they do half orders, so if you're vibing mac as a side, you can easily do that.   For breakfast, I've had just about everything on the menu, but the biscuits and sausage gravy are some of the best I've had in Phoenix.",

It's a nice vibe, young people primarily - I'm in my 60's now - and I thought they served us a fantastic cup of coffee. Looked like a lot of nice treats there behind the bakery counter as well. I'm going to knock off one star, though, because the place was a little on the grungy side. Tables with messes, stuff on floor and so on. Yes, it was a weekend mid-afternoon, so that's a busy time, but still . . . us older hippies, we kept things clean! Kids these days . . .",

The atmosphere is relaxed and laid back... the first time I went with my co-worker we were greeted with \"what's up, guys?\" It's a cool place. I had an Americano both times and it was excellent. We also indulged in a different quiche each day we visited and both were the absolute best we'd had. SO GOOD.   If I had to give any points of feedback, I'd say make the order/pickup process a little more structured and clear to patrons. It tends to get busy and there's a clear lack of instructions (oh, hipsters) from the cashiers. I'm all for laid back but not when it causes chaos.  Overall, it's a great place and I would come here again!",

I usually try mac & cheese at every place I go if it's on the menu so I've tried my fair share but OMG was this outstanding!!!! The creaminess and cheesiness was PERFECT! No dry mac & cheese here!

The line is confusing, but just follow everyone else's lead and you'll figure it out in no time. I'm not usually a latte person, but I quite enjoy them at Lux. Maybe it's a psychological effect of the cute latte art. I love their hash with poached eggs, and I'm pretty sure there is crack in the bacon. You can sit inside or outside in front of Pane Bianco next door.   Last time I was in there I ordered a latte and espresso cupcake and instead I received a latte and espresso. I told the barista of the error and she didn't even bat an eye - acknowledged the error and quickly got me a cupcake. No harm, no foul. I don't want baristas who are sugary sweet and ooze with typical fake customer service. I can get that at Starbucks (along with burnt coffee, but that's another review). We're adults here. Just do your job and when mistakes happen quickly fix it. So while other people may complain that the baristas are rude, I quite appreciate the honesty.   Yes, there are tons of hipsters. But there's also tons of nerds, businessmen, cougars, and regular people like me. If you enjoy people-watching this is a great place to go.",

I'd been to some pretty good places back in CA, so have some pretty high standards regarding good coffee. I think Lux does a pretty decent job. The drip coffee and iced teas have free refills.  Food: A little pricey, but the food is always pretty good. Their macaroni and cheese is cheap, though, and awesome (5 bucks). You can get it with jalapeno and bacon (7 bucks). Sometimes, they even have pesto and chicken in it. They start serving dinner at 5:30. Their breakfast is always pretty good, too, and they always have a variety of different quiches.  Staff: All pretty nice and the more you come there, the more social they will be with you. If any even minor inconvenience arises, they're pretty good about spotting the charge, but it rarely happens that they have to do that.   Environment: Yes, there are a ton of hipsters there, but that's kind of to be expected with good coffee shops in any city. There's a lot of people studying, but there are people meeting socially throughout the coffee shop, as well and especially near the bar area. Plenty of outlets exist for you to plug into. They have a projector in the backroom and there is usually some sort of sporting event playing on it. The only con is that the internet (especially lately) has been somewhat spotty as the place is usually pretty busy and everyone and their grandmothers are trying to connect.",

My biggest complaint is that it definitely has an air of pretentiousness about it - the staff can sometimes border on being a bit conceited and snobby - but that's to be expected, it's unabashedly hipster. If you absolutely can't tolerate that sort of thing, you'll want to avoid this place like the plague; but if you're like me and can take it for what it is - and laugh a bit, in the meantime, at some of the feminine-looking twenty-something-year-old boys wearing handle-bar mustaches - it's honestly a super chill place. Plus, if you get tired of it, you can always walk just a block down the road to the almost infinitely less pretentious British pub. That said, Lux is a wonderful place, and I strongly recommend at least checking it out once (just know what you're getting into)",

    "text": "This cafe is SO COOL that I kind of hate it. I want to hate it, and I do hate it, but I absolutely love it. I want to have sex with it, mainly. I think that's why I felt so frustrated when I paid my visit.   After driving around and finally finding the sign for the place I had a hard time figuring out what building it was in; there was no sign indicating which of the two buildings it was in. After I tried opening a locked door to a restaurant, I realized it was the other building. I walked in and saw academic hipster chicks and dudes in square black rimmed glasses studying on their MacBooks and listening to their iPods. They stared at me as if I was disturbing the some silence. I knew it was this kind of place. It's why I came here. Hipsters have good taste in cafes.  I made my way to the counter looking for a menu and was distracted by the glass window of mega pastries, all of which will make your ass so fat, so you will have to run a marathon after brunch otherwise. I still didn't see a menu and I was famished. Looking around I noticed a dude dandied up in his tucked in red flannel, combed beard and slicked back hair pressing orange after orange into a giant, clear vat, and girls sitting at the mimosa bar in front of him watching the show. \"How Portland!\" I thought.   Finally, I saw a white piece of paper taped to the glass window. one font. one menu. no categories. beans. espresso. cappuccino. eggs. oatmeal. hash browns. etc. I just wanted a coffee and food. I couldn't read it fast enough to decide what I wanted, and I didn't want a bag of beans for breakfast. I ordered oatmeal w fruit + nuts because apparently Lux isn't hipster enough to add anything vegan to the menu. My total: $9. Coffee and oatmeal anywhere should never exceed $5 and should never be cheaper than $3.  I turned to find a place to sit and confused as to where I needed to pick up my oatmeal order when I saw a man smashed between some speakers playing music without words from his laptop. Some of the sounds relaxed and hypnotized me, while others caused me anxiety so much that I had to pee. I found the bathroom after I discovered there were other lounging rooms to eat in, one of which resembled an administrative office for an art school complete with projector and typewriter. Everything was color coordinated in turquoise, white, and accessorized with wooden \"coffee table\" stumps.   I sat down in a corner on a pleather couch and tried to slurp my steel cut oats  liquified in a cappuccino mug with a giant soup spoon. In the other hand I'd swap the spoon for the other cappuccino mug with coffee. Double fisting cappuccino mugs was my performance art for the day. Men stared.  I felt increasingly uncomfortable. The history channel was playing on the wall where my head was. Families stared at me as they walked by. I had to move, so I stood up, walked around slurping oatmeal, and watched the people on the back patio speaking with their hands. I felt as if I had to walk around and look at art and enjoy the hip design of the space instead of sit, which also seemed inappropriate as it distracted other patrons. I tried reading a magazine, but I was too distracted by others' movement and the music, so I felt I should just leave. The dark blend coffee was perfect. I poured it in a paper cup.",

For one thing, Mr. Schultz, you suck (for selling the Sonics and for making a Grande latte $4.50).  I have moved on.  I am now--not so secretly--in love with Lux.  I get a \"medium\", otherwise known as grande to you, for $2.75 AND......ANDDDDD.......and my barista free pours the vanilla syrup.  I mean, it also tastes orgasmic, the coffee, that is.  By the way, I think their pastries are homemade.  Either way, their pastries are a DELIGHT!!  I always get the mixed berry corn bread muffin ($2.75) to go with my latte.    Sincerely,  A serious coffee addict  On a more serious note, they have outside seating with misters when the weather is scorching hot.  Since it's fall, the weather's been a lot nicer and this is a great hang out spot. They have their own parking and accept all major credit cards.  Their baristas are friendly and remember your name. This is a great place to get coffee and breakfast. No, they are not a franchise so you may have to drive a ways if you don't live in central phx...but hey, this is what makes their coffee affordable, orgasmic and worthwhile.  You should try them...at least once.",

    "text": "I have to update my review. After moving downtown, Lux has become my new favorite coffee shop, breakfast spot, dessert spot and dinner spot. This place is ridiculously good. Their coffee is on spot and consistent throughout the day. Their egg sandwich is inexpensive (5$), yet super high quality. They actually make their food in *gasp* pans! No microwaves here. The egg sandwich is an over medium egg on an english muffin with cheese, bacon, and a roasted tomato. So good. Now, as good as that is, the biscuits and gravy are even better. This is what the BF gets for breakfast and what I eat off his plate when he's not looking :-P. The gravy has chunks of delicious sausage (and I don't generally care for sausage). The gravy is very well seasoned and full of flavor. Then, this week, we went to Lux for dinner. We had the bacon/jalapeno mac and cheese and the yorkshire pudding burger. The mac and cheese was creamy, spicy, salty and delicious. The burger was a knife and fork burger that had very flavorful meat (almost meatloaf ish) and a really good horseradish -y sauce. Finally, their desserts....I crave their desserts, especially their peanut butter brownie. That brownie is so awesome because it has the saltyness of the peanut butter and a rich and sweet chocolate flavor of the brownie....it's like magic. Brownies are never my first choice for a dessert....except here. This place continues to impress me and I will continue to frequent Lux at all hours of the day...",

Also, parking - there is parking off of central in the Pane Bianco lot if you follow that alley straight you'll hit a fork, turn left for the Lux parking lot, you can also get into it from W Turney Ave.  Had the Velvet Latte which I was surprised to find had a lot of foam as well, like a cappuccino, yum! It was rich and creamy as well which was wonderful.  Ordered the Nutella Banana Braid which I wasn't a huge fan of, not enough Nutella or sugar, it just felt like bread opposed to dessert.

Say no such thing to the white couple (I guess they can stay, why interrupt their nice outing?) 5. Offer to make it better and then ignore us (How long should I look at this empty glass?) 6. Create such a crappy vibe that we feel we should just go (Feedback is clearly not welcome) 7. Do all this on our anniversary!   We've been coming to Lux for years. My wife and I actually had our first date at Lux and it has always been a favorite spot for us. So much so, that we decided to celebrate our wedding anniversary here. Years of loyalty and THOUSANDS of dollars spent here mean nothing when the priority is the boss's accountant (who probably got the meal comp'd).   The worse part is that even after we brought it up, the staff did next to nothing to make it better. They halfheartedly apologized and justified their actions by saying that this was the owner's request. I guess we know where the rest of us stand.",

Its' great reputation is obvious by the amount of reviews, and its rating, but I'll still rave a little.   The coffee is wonderful. My first time there I got a hot latte, and I swear it felt like it was hugging me. I ordered breakfast (two eggs any way), and it tasted...clean! Bear with me on that adjective. The food was delicious, but it also felt healthy and fresh. I felt light, but still fulfilled afterwards.   The vibe/decor in this place is one that I personally love. It has that industrial yet warm feel, and it has plenty of places to sit. I mean they try to offer as many options as they can, sadly (happily for them obviously), every time I've visited it's been packed. I've had to sit outside a couple of times, which isn't the best during the summer, so make sure to arrive early if you're going on a weekend.   All in all, I dare say it's one of the best coffee shops in AZ!",

There is also a full menu of food items and even a bar. The atmosphere like I said is very hipster and you feel like people are staring, but like it's all about the coffee so who cares. The staff ranges from fairly nice to \"why are you here\". There is a parking lot in the back, but it fills quickly. There is also a decent amount of street parking available. Regardless of the weirdness of this place, the coffee is the bomb and I'll continue to feel awkward to get a taste of it.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying, getting to Lux, inside of Lux is way to confusing. I was meeting a friend who was already inside and it took me about 10 minutes to find her. By the time I got inside and seated I was so frustrated that I didn't even feel like trying to figure out what to order. The layout is super weird, especially for someone who has never been.  I even walked out to the street(sidewalk) to find some signage to verify I was in the correct place but I didn't even see a sign. She finally came out to get me lol  Once inside I decided on just the house coffee. The baked goods looked yummy but the cashier seemed rush & not friendly so I just wanted to order something and go sit down.   I will say the atmosphere is super hip, cute & comfortable.  It's a super causal place and they play really good music (not too loud).  I ended staying for about 3 hours and overall enjoyed myself.  Funny FYI...I had to use the restroom but was too afraid of wondering around getting lost so I held it LMBO!   I will go back but maybe when it's daylight and less busy so I can explore, get to know the place and take it all in.",

When we pulled into the parking lot we were unsure if this is the spot..because it looks like an abandoned warehouse from the outside.   We got a slice of the dulce de leche and vanilla cakes to share. My friend paid for the dulce de leche and said she was charged about $8? based on only getting back $2 from her $10 bill. I think maybe the cashier didn't know she gave her a $10..?  We found a table outside and dug into the desserts. That dulce de leche cake is something out of a dream. The toasted coconut. The creamy topping. IM HOOKED. And hopeful its not $8 for a slice..  The vanilla cake was good, the chocolate frosting was a good balance for it. I think the other cake just stole the spotlight for me.  We enjoyed our time chatting and meeting new people and having obnoxious conversations. It seems like a lot of people come here to do work and it has something to offer everyone.   This place is not for you if you need quiet, comfortable seating in a mellow coffee shop.....",

My husband and I are out of towners, we came to visit Phoenix for a long weekend, and I had read and heard from people this we should come here. So... we did.  The interior aesthetic is super cool. If we lived in Phoenix, I'm sure that this place would have been our go to coffee spot just based on the style and atmosphere.   Unfortunately, service was terrible. The cashier was not friendly what so ever, especially for our first time being here. It was so off putting that my husband and I talked about how we wouldn't come back after that interaction.   We were also VERY confused as to where this place even was. There wasn't any signage that it was where it was. I had to refer to photos through Yelp to figure out where the heck it was.",

Our local host says it can get crazy busy already.  So if you have gotten this far into this review, the secret is out.  Coffees I tried: Iced Caramel Black and White, Hot Caramel BW, and Iced Velvet Almond Milk BW.  Pastries I tried: Ginormous Coffee Cake, Lemon Poppy seed Muffin, and Strawberry Pecan Scone - they were all fantastic - My favorites of that bunch - Iced Caramel BW, and the lightly sweet crumb layer through the entire coffee cake.  It's really one of those places that just makes you want to come back... coffee/food addiction much?  The cooked food looked amazing coming out of their small kitchen - and all of the staff were all smiles.  The location has hidden dining spots with no real consistency or order to the layout - it's awesome.  Parking looks pretty limited here so beat the rush, and ask google for help finding it!",

    "text": "tl;dr This is a loud coffee shop with great drinks and food but limited parking and seating. A little overpriced, but not unexpected.  -- It's typical for coffee shops to have coffee, tea, and pastries, however this place also offers breakfast, lunch, dinner, and alcohol menus! I got the \"Two Eggs The Way You Like 'Em Bacon Or Tomato And Hash\" for $8.50 and a \"Black And White Iced Latte\". Both were delicious and I recommend them.   There is a small free parking lot with 27 parking spaces plus a little bit of street parking right before turning in. During non-peak hours, the parking lot was full and there were 2 street spaces left.   In theory, there is a lot of seating at Lux Central. However because the furniture around each table is bulky, if you're there by yourself or with just one other person, you're forced to take a whole couch area that actually fits 4-5. When I arrived there wasn't any seating available. Luckily as I was about to walk out without ordering, a couch/table area opened up. If you're planning on bringing guests here, prepare to take them somewhere else in case there's no seating.  There is loud, upbeat music playing. It's not as high as in a club, but it's definitely louder than background music. If you're going to have a conversation, you'll have to speak up. (Side note: Huge shout out to Saturday afternoon's playlist! Top 40 from the 2010's was amazing!)  I'd go back.",

    "text": "This was my 2nd visit to Lux in about 5 years, and man...it just keeps getting better!  We stopped in for a quick kick of caffeine, and this time I was driving without my local friend to help guide. As an FYI - the entrance is at the BACK of the building, on the right side. (if you're looking at the building from the main street running in front of it). We may have circled it once trying to get in... :S There is a parking lot situated in front of Pane Bianco - we parked there without issue.   Who doesn't love a cafe that serves quad shots in a cup and calls it good? Although I was super tempted to try the Andy's Six-Shooter Iced Coffee, I held it together and ordered a Quattro Iced Espresso and DA-YU-MMMM, that black gold did not disappoint! They roast all their beans in house...hats off to the baristas who know their beans well enough to serve quad shots that taste heavenly...Lux is only the second of two coffee shops that I have ever tried who have truly mastered that art! We tried the strawberry cornbread muffin (a to-die-for pairing!) and a banana sumthin' sumthin' muffin which smelled heavenly. All the coffee and treats. All of them.   The second delightful part of this particular visit was the middle-aged DJ chilling out playing coffee shop tunes on a Friday morning. I can't remember exactly, but I could swear he had Simon & Garfunkel on the go... it was a fabulous, funky atmosphere!   Lux has officially become a coffee must-have every time I'm in Phoenix, and I'll be sure to return!",

    "text": "A hip, modern, eclectic coffee house that serves breakfast plates with craft coffees and the gamut of espresso drinks.   If it's your first time here, the entrance to Lux Central is hard to find. You can slip through the crack alley in front of Pane Bianco to get to the door or you can go in from the side street and hit it from the back side. Another way to know you're in the right place... It's in the building next to Undefeated.   The line on weekends is constant but moves quickly. We were near the door when we started and were at the register before 10 minutes were up. Someone will come up to you in line, take your drink order on a pad of paper, then you stay in line to pay at the cashier. A minute or two later, your drink is ready.   Lux Central to me is like a hipster version of the Friends' Central Perk. Exposed wood beams, grey brick walls instead of red brick walls, couches and weathered wood tables. The seating consists of chairs and couches of various styles and upholstery with people eating, studying, talking or playing board games. A fun, vibrant place that has a constant buzz but no annoying loud noises or people.   I ordered their iced coffee which is more like an Americano. Two shots of espresso over ice. You can get it with two shots, four shots or six shots. They use and roast their own blend of beans that are sourced from Ethiopia, Nicaragua, El Salvador, Panama, Sumatra and Brazil to make their espresso and coffee drinks. They even make their own chai! For tea, you would just picking from a selection of Republic of Tea offerings. They did a great pull on my iced coffee. Just tell them beforehand if you want to leave room for cream or not. They do not make a cold brew here.   They have a considerable assortment of pastries and breakfast menu items but I didn't have any so I won't comment on those.   If you are looking for a good cup o' joe and want a fun place to hang out with friends, study, or break the awkwardness of a first date, Lux Central is super stellar for all of that!",

I came for the food and there they did not disappoint! Every dish looks amazing and sounds like they are tasty. I got the Aunt Glady's breakfast and devoured every bite like it was my last. The tender belly bacon was my favorite, it was crispy but not burnt which some place seem to struggle with.

    "text": "Lux is one of the busiest coffee places in Central Phoenix. Parking can be difficult to find as the lot is shared with Pane Bianco. There are also street parking available on the right side of the building if the private parking is full. Be expected to wait in a long line that moves rather quickly (less than 8 mins). Bring your A game if you're planning to find a seat around peak hours, e.g. noon on a Saturday. There is a lot of hustle and bustle as you will find students studying with their books/laptops, coffee lovers getting their daily dose of caffeine, and hungry people grabbing breakfast/lunch. Planning to catch some sunshine? Have no fear as there is outdoor seating to the rescue. While waiting in line, I often look forward to grabbing one of the postcards on the counter. The Lux postcards are different every time I come in, which keeps it fun.   I love the coffee and latte art. My all-time favorite is the iced hazelnut latte, a smooth drink with the perfect balance of creaminess and sweetness. The velvet latte also hits the spot. All of their freshly made desserts always catch my attention every time I'm waiting in line. I really enjoy getting their package of 3 chocolate chip cookies that is cutely packaged and convenient for on the go. They have a good selection of breakfast/lunch that is popular amongst the regulars. I have yet to try their food.   If you're planning to study there, plan to bring headphones. It can get very distracting and loud with people conversing and walking in & out. They do not have a lot of single tables. Plan to get comfortable and meet a new friend on those long group tables. Wifi is available.   I will continue to return for their awesome coffee and mouth-watering sweets.",

I ordered the Arrugala salad which is $10 on the menu.   I was told that tax is now added and that my bill was $11.95.   I told them that would mean that the tax was 20% which couldn't be True.  I was then told that the price of the salad was really $11.00 although it was shown as $10.00 on the menu.  Give me a break.  Lux should be ashamed of itself.",

But it looks like it is well known among the locals.  We went around 11am and it was  packed of young professional and students working on their laptops.  I love the artistic handmade, dark wood furniture.  Very homey.   We ordered ice coffee, Mac and cheese with bacon and jalapeno, egg cup with zucchini and mushrooms, and hummus dip.  Love the flavorful adult version of Mac and cheese: salty bacon and spicy jalapeno made the simple dish really fun. The egg cup was the best of all.  It was soft, peppery, and flavorful, definitely worth a try. Note that this is a breakfast item and takes 10 to 15 minutes to make.",

Like, I'm surrounded by the most beautiful people, and also the most hipster, and also the pinkest leather couches and chairs, and it's some old industrial chic thing, and no real sign on the building, and seriously, I do not have enough cool points to enter.  And yet, I did enter.  And I sorta loved it. Ya, it's a bit of a scene. You just kinda crowd the barista area and get your coffee (drip only) and some kind of pastry or scone. Then you camp out on the sofas, the tables, the big communal tables in one of the back rooms, or just sit and soak it in. On this particular day, one of the back rooms had a news feed projected on the wall, showing the big political event of the day. No idea if they always show news/tv/whatever, but that could be interesting too.  There's a small menu of prepared dishes as well, but I didn't grab one. It looked to be like small comfort breakfast foods with an elevation. The ambiance is quintessentially hipster, but I actually love that in this case. Why do some people think that's a bad thing? Well dressed dudes with beards and dreads, and delightfully modern women with vintage dresses? Ya, I'm down. I'm not cool enough for that crowd, but I'm down.  White chocolate apricot scone is a hit, as was the quiche lorraine. I'm not a coffee dude, but caffeine snobs might not love that you can't get a pour over. Get over it. Pop in, join the army of laptop warriors, and stay a while. Are you cool enough?",

As dumb as it may sound, it isn't as obvious as one would hope. It's right there but there's no obvious signage telling you where it is. I was about to leave but then read the reviews again and I really wanted to see it. For tourists: it's to the left of the green restaurant.   First thing, the atmosphere both inside and out was great. It was a little steamy inside, but I got accustomed, plus it was busy. So I understood. Easy going staff that didn't judge me for not necessarily knowing how the place works.  Simple and straightforward. One sized coffee, free refills. Amazing, I wish more places would do that. It makes things easy and to the point.   I ordered the Dutch pancakes with fruit. It was wonderful. The dish was sweetened by the fruit and whip cream. So slightly that I was able to enjoy every bite. Fresh fruit, and the mixture of the hot pancake, cold fruit and sweet whip cream created many different textures and feels that were delectable.   Music was a little too loud at moments but it quit down after a little. Plenty of space and room. If you're in Phoenix, give this place a visit.",

    "text": "Items Selected: Cold-brew Coffee Lux Friand Strawberries and Cream Scone White Chocolate Raspberry Muffin Blueberry Corn Muffin Cinnamon Coffee Cake Pecan Banana Nut Bread Dutch Pancake with House-whipped Cream and Berries  Recommended by a well-traveled Las Vegas Chef, the hip vibe and Coffee program cited in addition to a substantial number of house-baked goods, it was just past nine on a rainy New Year's Day that three visitors settled into a couch of pink leather at Lux Central, the house already more than 3/4 full with a growing line as a middle-age DJ spun shoegaze intermixed with other mid-tempo tunes.  Generally open 6am to Midnight, the late night leading to 2017 allowing staff to sleep in a bit, those arriving at 4400 North Central Avenue on 01/01/17 consisted of all ages and genders with a lean towards Millennials, a hirsuit young Barista taking orders from the line and passing them on to a colleague in order to expedite traffic while a team of clerks gathered pastries and generated tickets for orders requiring preparation from a postage stamp-size kitchen in the back.  Focusing mostly on Quick Breads and American classics, glamour-shots of David Bowie and Chewbacca contributing to the decor, it was after slow perusal approaching the counter that a sizable order was formulated, a total of six pastries presented on five plates with twenty-minutes quoted as the wait time for a $9 Dutch Pancake.  Not in any rush, the leisurely morning a welcome change of pace from days prior, it was with self-gathered silverware that a tasting got underway, first bites of the Strawberry Scone trending sweeter and softer than the British staple while the Raspberry Muffin was minimally different in texture, the small chunks of White Chocolate simply replacing pockets of melted Butter in the former.  Smiling at the $1 Friand with a cursive \"L,\" essentially a Hostess Cupcake made dense with better Cocoa, Lux Central's Coffee Cake as well as the Banana Bread do an admirable job of negating Phoenix's dry-air by dialing up the wet ingredients, the Blueberry Corn Muffin also showing well with what seems to be a 1/3 each ratio of Butter, Berries and Cornmeal.   A bit compromised by crowding, a lack of table service requiring diners to be attentive to their name being called out from a kitchen nearly 30-yards away from the door, it was precisely nineteen minutes after ordering that the high-walled Pancake was collected, a crisp rim surrounding no less than four types of fresh Fruit plus a sizeable dollop of hand-whipped Cream that made any thoughts of Syrup unnecessary.",

I wish I had gotten the chance to come back in the evening and check out the bar! Next time...",

If you haven't been you should go, bring your creativity, have a coffee and interact with some people.   (This is coming from a guy who grew up in Seattle and has had coffee at Cafe Greco. However in fairness, the deserts are not even close to what Cafe Greco has..... they would have to be seriously earth shattering to be better in that department.)   Don't let that detract you. Go to Lux. It's spot on.",

The bar top is low and there are multiple places to order at which causes them confusion. The drinks and snacks are amazing. You can easily flutter around 30people on macs doing schoolwork, lifework, or artwork.  Get comfortable and hang out. Doesnt matter if you're loud either because everyone's listening to their headphones. I also love the staff here. They're helpful, friendly and clever.",

After we asked to be served, they told us to hold on and then spent 15 more minutes intentionally going out of their way to ignore us. We eventually left because the bartenders were much too rude and pretentious to justify spending my hard earned cash there. Such a disappontment.\"  Since then, I've gone back numerous times and actually love the place. I still hold to my previous sentiment that the staff could not seem any more bothered to help you, though, with that said, it is a pretty rad place. Their desserts are bomb, their coffee is really good, and the ambiance is really ecclectic. I would go there to study, hang out with friends, or have a fun and chill night out.",

The menu changes daily too which is so much fun. This place is close to school so I can see myself spending lots if days studying on their comfy couches. Their long wooden dining table was perfect for us nursing students to spread out million books out on! My iced skinny caramel latte tasted like it was full of cals and goodness! The coffee beans they use are sooo much more tasty than Starbucks! There's also a bar on one side. We saw oranges being squeezed into champagne and the drink menu was something special! Will have to test it out in a day I don't have my nose in my books! Brain has to rest, right?! This is one of those hard to describe places, so you must indulge for yourself! Most definitely a place to try!",

And Phoenix can feel like an odd, random place to have landed when you are 58 years old, as I am - how, precisely, did I wind up on the searing desert, and how did it happen to all of these other people who I see sweating on the street?   At Lux, however, the existential depression shuts off, and its polar opposite flips on - how delightful that we've all come together into this cool, noisy, crowded, friendly, interesting space to have some coffee! If life is indeed random, let's all be randomly happy together!   I have written parts of two books here, and the energy of Lux is on every page - it's a good place to do the difficult business of writing readable prose.  And no one here is a \"hipster,\" a word that does the world absolutely no good. They are young, for the most part, and enjoying being with their friends in the wonderful, intense, lovely way young people have since the dawn of humanity, and they are doing it a nice place in the middle of an awful, hot, barren desert, because young people are great and resilient and clever and wonderful. Old people are too, for that matter.   The whole place, the whole thing, is a testimony to just how fantastic people are, from the people who built this place to the people who come here to the people who smile as they hand over your coffee and ask about your day. Relax, smile, enjoy - it's a little easier at Lux, and when you leave, maybe you'll find it easier to do these things elsewhere.",

The staff was extremely pretentious and quickly became annoyed with my sister and I because they couldn't hear what we were ordering over the loud music! The two of us became extremely uncomfortable instantly and then to make it worse, had to wait 20 minutes for our drinks because they were both made incorrectly and our orders kept getting pushed to the back of the assembly line. Our finished drinks were hardly worth the wait, the espresso was average at best and (petty complaint incoming) our very normal names were misspelled! How do you mess up Amber and Gloria? Needless to say, we did not finish our drinks and left quickly.",

They offer almond milk and make good chai. Good people-watching. They score cool points for being open on Christmas and having a Christmas dinner there. I love that. I am a little disturbed that the pastries aren't covered in a glass case, and it is more expensive than other cafes, but I just love that there are alternatives to Starbucks, so I will support them.",

Very busy place so I'd never find myself studying there (I need quiet to very minimal background noise--just to give you a reference). All the baked goods were on point! My boyfriend tried the espresso bundt cake which was just fantastic-- excellent frosting! I tried the paleo cookies they had for sale at the register, very soft and delicious. My friend who has been a long-time customer had me try her black coffee. I have to tell you that I am a huge creamer-in-her-coffee type girl but the black was smooth, slightly sweet, and not bitter AT ALL. Win. I liked the atmosphere! Very fun and there's tons to look at. Our seats were comfortable and we had no trouble finding one for all three of us at about 5 pm. I'm definitely going to be back!",

After having a wonderful lunch with a girlfriend of mine, we decided to come check this place out.  I probably would have never found this place by myself.  its in a little yellow brick building, and I didnt see any signage.  I pulled into the parking lot, parked the car and went inside.  The place was packed!  Its small, and it was wall to wall people. Some on computers, some just hanging out, others were sitting outside socializing amoungst themselves.  There was really no where to sit!  I guess thats a good sign!  :-)  Anyways, from what I could see, the place was nicely decorated.  Went to the counter and placed an order for a cafe ole, and the girl kind of looked at me funny.  I guess she didnt know what that was?  (its half coffee, half steamed milk, FYI.)  A girl behind her told me that they make it different here, or whateves.  ugh, so I ended up with a slightly different drink then I had anticipated.  Slightly dissapointing!  Anyways, I dont know that I will be back anytime soon.  Why? Because this place was to small, to crowded and I would have no place to sit and and enjoy myself.  I know, I know, dissapointing, but for as sheik and as cool as this place is, I usually come in tow with my computer, or at least the intention of spending a while (like an hour) here doing something.",

It is a neat coffee shop/bar. It was pretty crowded on a Friday night which I did not really expect. We ended up having to sit outside because inside was so packed. Also at one point it got so packed that strangers joined us at our table because there was no room anywhere else haha. However, it is packed for all the right reasons haha. The baked goods looked so delicious. I was not hungry when I went, but I really want to come back and try something. This one person had like some kind of fancy looking pie cake thing. I also walked past a few people eating some sort of mac n cheese I think? Whatever it was, it looked amazing. The laid back atmosphere is great too, it was a nice place to hang out for a bit. people were playing board games and stuff near the entrance which looked like fun! There are like different sections too which I liked. A room that kind of looks like a theater, I thought that was an interesting touch for a bar/ coffee shop. I just came for a drink and had a glass of malbec, which I really enjoyed. They served me a pretty large glad of wine too which was great for the price I thought! They have a pretty good wine selection which is awesome. It looked like they make good mixed drinks as well, I saw a bartender pounding and preparing rosemary for a drink. I would totally come back to try a drink like that the next time I come. The service was good too which is always a plus!  I want to come earlier in the day and get a mocha or latte or something. This place was cool, I would like to spend more time here! Only complaint is how ridiculously crowded it was, I will have to try to come back at a time where Lux is not quite as busy as it is on a Friday night. Overall, I left impressed and happy with my visit!",

    "text": "In the Phoenix hipster scene, there may not be a more important place to see and be seen than Lux. And I have mixed feelings about that.   Coffee:      Delicious. They roast their own beans and their baristas are well trained, even though there seems to be a different crew each of the last few times I've been in.  Iced Tea:      Strong but delightful, however no 32oz teas here. Less bang for your buck.  Alcohol:      Never had a drink here, but their menu can seduce me from across the room. Also, its a separate bar from the barista station, so a bartender is totally devoted to the cocktails.   Food:     Pastries, YUM. Macaroni mug, DOUBLE YUM.   Wifi:     Consistently good.  Price:      Sometimes it feels like I'm paying for the product + a cover charge for being allowed to be here.   Service:      Unsure? Like I said, I've seen a slew of different staff here so I'm not sure if they have a huge crew or high turnover. Regardless, when I suggested to a friend that she should work here, she said, \"oh I'm not cool enough to do that\" and we both agreed that we would have a hard time competing with the persona embodied by the staff. They are what you think of when you think of 'indie', and along with that comes a certain attitude that I find welcoming when I'm donning trendy and standoffish when I'm not. \"Customer first\" is not a mantra I'd expect in their training, but I get that that comes with the territory of being 3rd wave.  Ambiance:      As I opened, this is the scene to be seen if you're trying to be included in the PHX counter-culture moment. With that comes some skepticism on my part as to wether or not Lux even fits in to 'counter-culture' anymore. Most everyone working or patroning is dressed for an album cover, so much so that it crosses the line from being a place that simply attracts that kind of person, to a place where people dress up to attend. Lux has become a pretentious venue in my mind, and I only come in when a friend wants to meet here or I am in the area needing a late night fix (they're open till midnight during the week- much later than most in PHX).      Also on 'ambiance', however, the set-up of the coffeehouse is completely unconventional, which is awesome and part of the draw. Mostly quirky, in some parts awkward, Lux is essentially a collection of rooms each with their own design elements. The interior layout is incongruous, which is refreshingly disruptive. There are plenty of wide tables for studying both inside and outside, as well as a large number of different lounge setups. But, I will note, finding a place to sit can be difficult, no matter what time of day you come. Because of this, I will finish by saying that the study environment won't work for everyone. Tonight I'm here to finish a paper and debated for a long time if that was a realistic goal given the crowd and noise. The Music is louder than other places too. I think for today, this is conducive to some good flow, but most of the time I turn elsewhere.  Check it out if you're visiting town, or if you and your friends need an after-activity when you're in the downtown area. But for a traditional, welcoming coffeeshop, keep looking.",

To die for!  ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  The atmosphere, coffee, and food here is amazing. There is a lot of space for anyone wanting to hang out here as well as outlets and wifi.  I got a pork vegetable lentil soup with a biscuit and it is AMAZING. I would highly recommend getting this if it shows up on the menu. The biscuit is delicious.  The mac and cheese is very cheesy and the past cooked perfectly. I would recommend the mac and cheese as well.  Overall, a great place to come any time of the day.",

The atmosphere is great the music is always different any day you come in and the bartenders are by far the best in the area. Great for that kick back and have a beer, drink or wine kinda place. For me it's just the staff that make it so much better than the rest. If anyone gives this place less than 4 they need to STFO.",

    "text": "1. The honey latte here is the most badass mofo of a morning drink. The last sips are the honeyest.  2. If you eat bacon like I occasionally do, bear in mind it's really fatty at Lux. I'm not into that sort of thing, because I prefer a bacon bits texture, only hot. So I have to ask for them to make it extra crispy. When they comply, it works, but I do still visualize clogging arteries. I consider what cholesterol looks like, and fatty liver disease in non-alcoholics, and all the other things I research on the internet because I consume information even more voraciously than food. I also think about how pigs are as intelligent as dogs so then I engage in some mental self-flaggelation and ultimately proceed anyway and just promise I won't do this very often and that I'm going to go vegetarian for another 5 years to fix things.  3. There's a scene in Lena Dunham's Tiny Furniture movie where her crummy old high school friend, the one with the British accent played by Jemima Kirk, whose character is a questionable ex-heroin addict who's so self centered and unhelpful that she's seemingly bent on keeping Lena Dunham down is trashed in her mom's house in the bathroom with her while Lena Dunham's little sister is having a totally-not-allowed party in their NY flat while their mom is out of town. While Lena Dunham's character is totally worried about what to do regarding the high school kids party going on in the house, her British friend is like, \"Yeah, they're really being bad. Do you want something to eat? Listen, I want something to eat. Let's go into the kitchen. Let's scrum into the kitchen and get a crust of bread or cheese.\"  When I heard that line, I thought it was so odd and it really stuck with me. I mean, why would anyone have a craving for a CRUST of bread?  Then I went and ordered the baked eggs at Lux and it came with sliced thick pieces of french bread on the side with huge crunchy crusts that are totally amazeballs, and especially so when you're basically done with the baked eggs, but see that there's actually still some baked eggs left, stuck to the sides of the big mug that they bake them in, and so you use the crust of bread to clean out the inside of the mug, which is so much more effective a utensil than a pathetic fork, plus it's an edible utensil, and then you learn how completely right on that British ex-heroin addict friend of Lena Dunham's was.  Even friends who are mostly totally wrong are totally right about some things.",

Obviously this place doesn't need more good reviews (lol), but the coffee is stellar, the vibe is rad, and the food is more consistently delicious and unique than it really has any right to be considering how great everything else is. Even better, this joint is open LATE which is ideal for night owls and students alike.   I am DISTRAUGHT to leave it behind. I nursed my very last iced latte sadly on the freeway back to my town. So my real question is: what does a girl have to do to get a Lux in Tucson, Arizona?? (I'll be waiting.)",

It's soft in the middle with cinnamon and sugar... AND it has a little delicious hint of lemon.  -whip cream! It's amazing! It's more than you can imagine. It's homemade and they just plop a big spatula full into your cup!   -look for/ask for Cheryl! She is awesome! She's taken my order multiple times. Has a great sense of humor and is super sweet. She's one of the people that you ask her to change your order last minute and even though that's an annoying thing to deal with, she makes you feel like it's not a big deal and not to worry about it! -great service!",

Many of those who are deny being hipster as well. It's not hip. But Lux is a hipster hangout to be sure.   Why? Because the staff are friendly, the food is of the best homemade quality you can find, and the drinks are very well crafted. The coffee roast and grind are perfect. We ship bags to our daughter living in the UK, where the shipping cost double the bag. It's that worth it.   The pastries and small plates are amazing. The Whoopie Pie is incredible. The breakfasts are filling and VERY well put together. I favor the biscuits and gravy with eggs....amazing. Overall the place can't be beat for a 2-3 hour stay. Get there early.",

The reason I am giving this place a 1 out of 5 stars is because of the following: (1) this place has HORRIBLE customer service- In all the occasions I have been to this place I have not once been treated respectfully. They are constantly in a rush since it's always packed and obviously customer service is not there priority. (2) The products that they sell are definitely great, but the prices are way too expensive (They make Starbucks look cheap).(3) They have horrible internet service- I've brought my laptop to get some work done in numerous occasions and due to the horrible internet service they have I was not able to get the things I wanted to accomplish done. (4) They do not fill up your drink all the way to the top of the cup. I am paying over $6 for ice coffee I should definitely be getting that shit filled up to the top. Although, the coffee and pastries are pretty damn good they have several improvements that need to be made in order to get 5/5 stars.",

The girls were too busy talking with each other and couldn't even acknowledge me saying thank you. If you want me to keep coming back, good customer service is a must. I didn't order any food but it all looked and smelled delish. They were playing great music though and it was loud enough that I couldn't listen to music in my headphones. I didn't really mind though because I like music when I study. Overall, just an okay place. I might head back with my husband for him to check it out.",

From what I hear their cocktails are to die for! I haven't had a chance to try one yet, but when I do I will definitely come to let you know if it's True! The deco in this shop is very unique very urban industrial with a twist of vintage. Love it! The staff is super friendly. The 2 downsides of this place is 1 the menu as sometimes I find it hard to look at and read as it is posted on computer paper I don't know if they do have other menus anywhere else though. And 2 how extremely busy they get, which is a good thing for the business side of it. It's just a tad bit overwhelming specially when you're an indecisive person as i am.

The ambiance of the shop lends itself to a study and work atmosphere. In this same breadth, it simultaneously offers people the ability to converse with a group of friends. In my humble opinion, the musical selection is on point and it reminds me of being in Portland and Seattle. This in and of itself is lofty praise from a snobby coffee drinking individual from the Pacific Northwest. As a transplant to Phoenix I would not say that this shop is a breath of fresh air, but rather a ray of light in a city devoid of coffee shops that offer quality service and goods. Even on a lively weekend where customers are spilling in and out of establishment the coffee served is always fresh and smooth. However, it is my recommendation to go during the week, as the coffee is not always as warm as one might come to expect. This is of no fault of the barista staff as they do not have an iota of downtime between orders. It is also worth noting that customers have access to a patio and a delicious selection of sweet and savory pastries. Although I may long for the coffee shops of Portland I believe that Lux Central is deserving of lavish praise and regular visits --especially for those who appreciate the way a cup of coffee, latte, or mocha should taste.",

    "text": "The awesome thing about Phoenix that even most locals don't know about is how the best food places are discreet and tucked away. Lux is one of those places. I drove down Central countless times and never noticed it. Now, I can't stop pointing it out to others!  I LOVE the vibe there. As soon as you walk through the double doors, people are scattered throughout the numerous couches, chairs, stools, tables, and futons they have, each with their own story. You have to seat yourself after you order your own food, so if you want a sit down dinner with some peace and quiet, maybe this isn't the best place. I still go on date nights because I love the atmosphere and the energy. Sometimes it's so packed that you have to sit next to a perfect stranger, but that's never bothered me. Going to Lux means being open - be open and you'll get the most out of your experience.  The only grievance I have is that I wish they served breakfast longer because their menu is perfect! I swear by their biscuits and chorizo gravy, it is to DIE for. Their bacon is great by itself, too. Their black cherry Italian soda with cream my choice of drink, and their pastries change from day to day. I love being surprised with their choices each time I go. Place your dishes and cups in the plastic bin near the kitchen on the way out - clean your immediate area, place everything in that bin, and they'll take care of the rest. Again, some people hate that part of it, but I love it. I feel like I'm part of it all.  Maybe it's \"hipster\" to some, but to me, it's a great representation of Downtown Phoenix: cool, relaxed, independent, yummy, colorful.",

So, hipsters can be sorta cool, but I still think showering at least 4 times per week should be mandatory if one is going to wear the hipster label.

This is one of the few places I've found that really helps me get into the \"zone\" come crunch time, which is surprising considering all of the people watching, tasty dining (bacon jalapeno macaroni please!) and delightful tunes it offers its visitors.  Yes it gets crowded, but I've never not been able to find a seat, as there are plenty to be had inside and out. The ambiance is amazing and might almost make you forget where you are from time to time. I've literally spent an entire day here on more than one occasion without even realizing. I'll refrain from saying just how many times so as to avoid potentially being charged rent, but the answer is a lot. It's that cozy.  Come here if you want to warm up with some chai, plug something in, absorb productivity juices, or just plain enjoy life. 'Tis a swell place.",

Just looking at their amazing baked goods display would prompt a celiac sufferer to hit the depression meds. I mean their stuff looks Fantastic. It's hard not to get more than one thing! Best flaky biscuits ever, great croissants and scones too. Their breakfast hash is also quite good (especially the crispy bits) and thankfully it's veg- friendly but won't disappoint the meat eaters.  The staff is super friendly and the atmosphere is comfortable for a long drawn out cup of coffee or meal. The decor is an eclectic mix of designy and vintage objects (you can show your kids what a real typewriter looks like), though it's a tad forced.  Come for the coffee, stay for the baked goods!

Like I said earlier, this isn't just a hip place to sit.  The coffee here is splendid, and the froth designs on the top are always a welcome addition to my the rich coffee goodness.  It is expensive so I don't go everyday like some of Lux's more affluent customers, but luckily Lux sells their espresso for me to take home and brew myself.  After I brew a couple shots, I sit at my dining room table, blast some indie music, put on my black framed glasses, read a Chuck Palahniuk book, and think about how cool I am.",

It's infuriating to me as someone that worked in the service industry for years, and I had to stop coming here because of their general disdain for the customer.  They would definitely rather be considered edgy than customer friendly.  The quality of food and coffee is above average (especially their bakers) but their inconsistent menu is almost as annoying as their website, which is just further proof that their focus is more on appearance than substance.",

The setting is great, the ambiance is relaxing, love the music (not overly distracting if you need to study), and there is a good selection of sweets/drinks.   I wish they would have a larger menu, though. At least the last time I went, they had a list of food you could order on a regular sheet of paper tacked to the wall. And it was difficult to see if the line is long or if more than one person is crowded around it.   Overall, do go visit!",

No obvious entrance, haphazard decorum comprised of mixed patterns and conflictingly bright colors, Urban Outfitters-esque transparent acrylic furniture, cat art, and pallet wood trim cumulatively coalesce into a statement that screams \"THIS IS THE PINNACLE OF COOL, ALSO IT'S PROBABLY NOT ENTIRELY AUTHENTIC\".   However, I will submit, the framed photography peppered around the establishment did make me swoon. And, the almond milk latte I had was supremely delicious. I went back the next day to get another latte and buy a bag of their coffee beans, and although I haven't brewed it yet, the coffee smells excellent. I actually think I'm going to preemptively buy a second bag to bring back to Boston with me. Both times I went the service was very friendly and fast.  If walking around an unmarked building looking for an entrance while a gaggle of hipsters quietly get off on your not-in-the-know-ness doesn't bother you, it's a good place to drop into, especially if you're checking out the Phoenix Art Museum or otherwise in the area with some time to drown in a vat of frothy cafinated goodness.",

We got the strawberry vanilla bean scone to share, and the SO got the espresso macchiato while I got the chai latte. It's a very hipster vibe and the place was packed and overflowing at 1030AM on a Sunday, but the staff are super efficient and we got out order in no time at all. The scone is moist and very flavorful, and I wished I had gotten a few more to try. The SO liked his macchiato, I thought my chai was just standard.

They have delicious looking desserts that I must try next time in! They have a lot of outdoor seating, a good amount of indoor but it's always so packed. The parking isn't too big of an issue unless it's super busy. There's a small parking lot and street parking as far as I know, so goodluck!! A must try - great ambiance, great coffee, very hipster, friendly staff, clean restroom, and somewhat hidden in the rear entrance :)",

As a frequent traveler I have found some of the best, hard to find, off the grid bizarre located food spots. Lux definitely is one of them and is high on the return list for:  *Amazing baked goods *Hysterical cute man running the register *Fab gal taking barista orders and facilitating the crazy line. Her customer service was spot on.  It's a bummer (yes my use of antiquated terms shows my age) that Lux has some frequent patrons that seem slightly spoiled, rude and frankly full of themselves -  Future Lux patrons ignore the whining narcissistic reviews, clearly these people have no perspective on what is important in our world today - LUX is damn good coffee and incredible food-  Wish Lux had another location closer to us in San Diego but then again no, it would ruin the uniqueness!",

NO signage anywhere, we finally found it (I think) and entered through a mysterious door to find what looks like a bus station with people on their laptops watching a huge screen tv, huh? Apparently we missed the orientation and training for guests because as we walked into the main dining area we had absolutely no idea who was working there and who wasn't. Not once in the ten embarrassing minutes did anyone say hi, or can I help or can I get you anything? It felt like a club we were not members of.   Perhaps not a place to go for the first time in darkness? We eventually spun around and left after not being able to get anyone to assist us. What kind of business is this?  The yelp reviews looked pretty good, though there are 900 reviews that are not \"recommended\" which are more closely related to our experience, not sure why yelp buried so many.  So no signage, no hostess, no menu, it felt like a Fellini movie,  we may have been  extra's though no one gave us any direction, ... so we left.",

    "text": "It makes me sad to say this, since I was so excited to pay a visit to this cute little place occupying what was once a pawn shop across the street from my high school, but I was not really impressed with Lux.  I went twice in the course of a couple of weeks and the trips averaged a rating of \"eh.\"  Trip #1: Girl barista is nice, suggests upsizing from a small-sized chai latte to a medium because the small is only slightly larger than a shot glass.  It's midweek in the p.m. so the place isn't too busy, making it a nice place to relax.  Sadly, the chai is lackluster.  It tastes kind of watered down.  My friend has the Velvet, which is way better.  When it's time to leave, there is some confusion as to where the garbage can is located (Answer: way in the back).  Trip #2: Guy barista is a bit snotty.  Again it's suggested that I upsize to the medium (why even have the small really?) and then is a bit pissy when I tell him I really only want the Velvet in a small.  I say no thank you to the whipped cream, trying to muster some sort of self-control.  When I go to pick up my drink, the barista is putting some whipped cream on my friend's drink.  \"The whipped cream is really good,\" he tells me.  I hesitate, watching him dole out the tasty confection and he sees me.  \"You already said no,\" he says as he closes up the container and smugly puts it back under the counter.  Now, maybe he's trying to be funny, but if that's the case, he needs to work on his delivery because it just comes off as being snotty.  The place is full of people tonight.  My friend and I sit on the white chairs up towards the front.  There are dirty plates and cups on all the tables and everything is just a bit askew.  It just feels a bit grimy.  My Velvet is only okay.  It's probably much better with the whipped cream.  Overall, I just kind of got a pretentious vibe from the place.  I feel like I can get a tastier Chai and way less attitude over at Copper Star.",

They play good music, though at times it's a little loud for conversation if you're sitting inside. They have shaded outdoor seating with misters to help you stay cool during the summer heat.

    "text": "With all the construction for the legendary rail of Phoenix, I first missed Lux since it was behind orange cones. But turned back around and thanks to the pictures posted on Yelp! found it easy enough. There were a couple of picnic benches with groups of people laughing and studying, drinking iced coffees and smoking. The interior was really pleasant. The music was a little loud-but, hey Brazilian Girls? Fine with me. There were a couple of guys to the right of the place hanging out on couches with calculators doing some hard-core homework. At the tables to the left were Europeans shootin the shit and taking pictures, laughing it up. The counter was low and while the pastries looked bangin, they weren't labeled and under kind of frosted domes, so a little hard to figure out what they were. I prefer pastries in the morning, anyway, no big deal. Both of the staff there were friendly and made me a Soy Chai for 2.50 (no extra for the soy-YES) and it was a REAL soy chai-no mix! Delicious. Under the counter were shelves-some with business cards and flyers. Another set had tons of magazines to borrow and freebies. Another shelf had kids books and colouring supplies (awww). The place looked clean and people were pretty happy to be there. I settled in near the front window on a low seat with a Business Week, Surface, Vogue and a book I was working on. I looked around some more and while I liked the white motiff...the problem with white? It gets dirty. And yeah...it looked a little unkempt. It felt a bit like a rumpus room. Not the best feeling. But so shabby mod! The artwork was well-displayed and attractive to the all-white decor and all kinds of different people of different race, age, backgrounds came and went in the hour I was there. The bathroom was well kept and I noticed they had Meyers products for toilet bowl and hand cleaner-I thought that was pretty kick-ass.  As they prepared to shut down, there were still groups of people just hanging out outside at the benches. Definitely a great coffee house and curious as to how it is during the day!",

I had kept telling the man about their coffee and how it reminded me of my favorite coffee place from when I lived in Seattle (Vivace.  Mmmmmm)  I had been to the old Lux and was curious to see the new one.  I was utterly confused.  There are three different counters.  The \"bar\" is in the back and distinguished by all the liquor bottles.  Easy enough.  But I had heard that they had sandwiches and what not now.  I saw an area that looked like where they made food, but was unsure as if I was supposed to order from them or from the barista.  When I asked if they had a menu, she said, \"We are your menu.\"  Um.... ok.  Is that the hipster thing to do now?  I'm a girl who likes options.  I didn't know what my particular craving was that day and I like to know what my choices are.  I also like to know prices.  I ordered my old stand by of a medium vanilla soy latte and the man got a double espresso and it came out to almost $8. That was fine, just a little shocking and had there been prices listed anywhere, I would have known what to expect.  And instead of trying this food they allegedly have now, we got a pizza from Pane Bianco next door.  Which was incredible.",

Both the small and medium have two shots; pick the small for an intense coffee flavor, or the medium if you like more milk.  I don't think Lux has flavored syrups, but their mocha and velvet add a wonderfully smooth chocolate base. So, my dear friends in Phoenix, enjoy your Lux because when you move you're not likely to find anything as good!",

After I discovered my pool pump was leaking, I called a pool service (Elite Pool Management) to come and fix the problem. Two days later and after several calls and voice messages with no response, I found Epic  Pool Service & Repair LLC on Yelp. Joe came out that day to inspect the pump (at no charge) to see what model and parts he might need to do the repair. He also explained what the problem might be and what could possibly be involved to fix it. He gave me a high estimate of the worse case scenario and a low estimate of a minor repair. That was on a Wednesday. Joe said he would be back on Friday morning at the very latest. Joe called the next day to inform me that he had the parts and would be there Friday morning. As promised he and a co-worker were at my house at 7 am. It took them less than an hour to fix the pump. I was very pleased when I was charged the low estimate and told my pump still had a long life ahead. Great doing business with them. I found EPIC POOL SERVICE & REPAIR LLC to be honest, professional and would highly reccommend them to family and friends.",

    "text": "Been hearing about Lux for months now, and finally I was downtown for something and figured I'd Google Streetview it. When I saw it and where it was, I realized I'd been here like four years ago. I jumped on the lightrail and headed up from downtown since it is only about 4 stops, but I screwed up and got off at Indian School. Don't do this, or you're walking. Stay on one more stop, and you're here!  Walking up to the place, it was pretty cool. Sail material over communal long tables makes it easy to meet new people, or relax in the shade with your caffeine and earphones. I wanted to work inside since I'd planned to stay for several hours (papers to grade!) so I headed in. The line wasn't too bad (I hear it can get bad some hours of the day) and the barista was really friendly. I got my usual (a black coffee) and it was $2.00. No problem. The ambiance struck me immediately. The lights were very soft and easy to work under. There were about 30 people, two dozen of them were on laptops, most were MACs, and since I too am an Apple FanBoy, I was stoked. Grabbed a seat near the cash register across from a beautiful woman studying religion and medicine (checked out her books next to her MacBook). I hate when the coffee is too hot (Starbuck's), and this coffee was perfect. Shot some pics, booted up my MacBookPro, logged into the free wireless, and I've been sitting here ever since. This place is everything everyone has ever said about it. Great great coffee house.  Side note: If you're here and want a great meal, head a (long) block south to George & Dragon for UK Pub food.",

    "text": "I don't know how, in the course of three years on Yelp, I have neglected to write about one of my most beloved Phoenix locales. Forgive me, Lux Coffeebar, but I think I got so distracted by COMPLAINING about OTHER places, that I have not had the chance to shower you with accolades.   Lux Coffeebar is by far, the best coffee in downtown/central Phoenix. They are consistent, offer a full espresso menu, and actually KNOW what a real macchiatto is. They offer a vast selection of in-house baked goods that are always incredibly satisfying and they are located right off the light rail next to one of the best lunch locations in the city (Pane Bianco). Their prices are low-normal and their interior is bright, clean, and full of local art. While their sleek, mod-inspired furniture may be intimidating to some (on first glance it  looks a little snotty), Lux is like a second home to me and has always been welcoming and comfortable. Its regular patrons are the type of people who will leave you alone if you're working on something on your laptop, but are always friendly for some conversation if you're feeling lonesome. It's good for meeting people and for studying, and the baristas are some of the best I have ever met in both skill and personality. They roast their beans in-house and also offer their coffee for home brewing. Owner Jeff Fischer (who is great with remembering names of regulars) is on the premises DAILY working both behind the bar and making fresh deliveries to his business of fresh fruit and ingredients for their wonderful tarts and other goodies. His wife Tara often brings over their little ones and over time you see that this hip location is really a down-to-earth family business in disguise. They even have a nice selection of glass-bottled sodas (real cane sugar only) and designer water. During the summer, their lemonade really hits the spot. Versatile, stylish, and full of that small-local business charm, Lux is one of the only places I will really, really, really miss when I relocate to California next month.  PS: Lux Coffeebar has a beautiful working relationship with Pane Bianco and you can bring your lunch inside without having someone nag you about outside food or drink, so eat up and grab a coffee while you're at it!",

    "text": "**UPDATE**  This is my most favorite coffee shop to spend a lot of time in.  Since the big remodel, it is even better than before!  They do serve alcohol and their menu looks pretty delicious.  If you are looking to set up your laptop and study, or get some work done, this is the place to go.  So many coffee shops, so little time!  Finally made it to Lux and I was not disappointed!  I wasn't there to connect to wi-fi but if I had been well this is the place to go.  However I was there to meet a large group of people (enter shameless plug for said group here...Indie Music Meetup group) and I must say the outdoor seating was great.  Big picnic tables and benches ample enough to squeeze in all 12 of us.  Granted it is hot and humid this time of year and sure that wasn't great but that is no fault of Lux!  Upon entering inside I realized it is a pretty hip joint and by that I mean all the local hipsters hang there.  But all in all it was a good mix of people working on their laptops right down to our group of indie music fanatics.  Time to order some coffee and a snack; seeing as how it was later in the evening I ordered a iced decaf soy vanilla latte and a strawberry corn muffin.  I had ordered one of the muffins that didn't sell too many that day and since they don't like to throw things out I got another for free, can't beat that!  Well, if velvet had a taste I'm pretty sure that it would taste like the coffee I drank.  I am generally leery to try decaf as it never quite seems to taste the same or a lot of places don't put much thought in to decaf since \"who orders coffee without the caffeine?\"  I love coffee, especially GOOD coffee and I will take the decaf as long as it is as delicious as the leaded version.  Lux nailed it for me and I will be back no doubt!!  I can't wait to try something else....maybe just a simple cup of coffee with cream.",

    "text": "Spent the 2013 holidays in sunny Phoenix with my family, and was very happy to take Yelpers up on their recommendation to stop by Lux for lunch. I love the layout and aesthetic of the place (imagine boho chic: reclaimed wood tables, fresh flowers, original framed art, vintage porcelain plate and dishware, and surprisingly comfy modern artsy chairs & sofas).  On the flip side, I also saw Lux through the eyes of my family (including two immigrant Chinese parents and two self-described 'yuppies') which gave me quotable perspective on what it's like to lunch here when you're *not* at all affiliated with the Pabst-drinking, Godard-quoting population. Some notable quotes from the familia, for whom eating at Lux was basically a sociological adventure:   \"Why does everyone here have beards??\" \"How can so many dirty people with long hair and tattoos afford to eat here?\" \"How come everyone has a Mac? Aren't those expensive??\" \"Why are we drinking out of mason jars?\"  Truth.  That being said, I personally loved the atmosphere. As a traveler, Lux immediately colors my impression of Phoenix as very liveable and lovable. Because it's popular, it's quite crowded, and the hip hop is a few decibels too loud for my taste, but the space is well-divided into quiet study areas, dining areas, and hangout areas. There are also tons of great children's books to keep your young ones happy. Lux is not kid-friendly in the sense that there are tons of baristas speed-walking around, and it could be a danger zone for coffee spills... but my nieces had a great time occupying a couch, scarfing down mac 'n cheese, playing with their toys and reading books.  The lunch items and pastries were delicious- freshly baked and/or cooked from high quality, well-selected ingredients. We had a godly pecan bar, a mixed berry corn muffin, bread pudding with fresh whipped cream, NY strip steak and baby arugula on grilled levain, the aforementioned mac 'n cheese, and a chai spice cookie, courtesy of the sweet barista who threw it in gratis, alongside my order for a dirty chai latte.  In short, how can you not love a place whose baristas will slip you free cookies? I miss Lux already.",

    "text": "I find myself craving impeccable smooth coffee similar to Intelligentsia, Toby's Estate, Stumptown, Counter Culture, Blue Bottle, [insert  more brands to reinforce coffee snob elitism]... the whole artisan coffee scene that lacks in Arizona overall. I think Lux is the answer for Phoenix's market for  coffee connoisseurship and boutique roasting.   Lux is industrial chic. Vintage industrial with soft touches of retro typewriters on tables. Its a muted scream of modernism without trying to hard. It's so effortlessly cool, clean, simple. The front side of the building facing East is all brick and hard to tell that there's even an awesome business running, let alone of what nature. Seems almost as if you have to be in the \"know\" to find it and hear about it.   Everywhere are cute hipster boys and girls which makes me fall in love and turn into a total creep peering and drooling not so secretly. The bar is a nice touch that was much needed and I'm glad they've now incorporated that into the place.   Coffee comes at the perfect temperature- not too hot where beans burn and leave a bitter sharp lingering muddle. The latte art is cool and a nice touch. You can get your coffe as a drip, chemex, French press.  Not sure about hario pour over or aeropress although I think they do have that option (unless I'm mistaken for a diff coffee shop in Phx area that offers that too)  Quality coffee is definitely prevalent. They roast their own coffee so you know it's fresh. The foam is always light and fluffy and not filled with too dense bubbles. Definitely lickable. They offer almond milk which is so refreshing as an alternative to soy.   The music can get loud sometimes so I tend to venture into the back patio. I haven't tried Lux's food but I'm sure it is up there, and if not, Pane Bianco right is next door.  My only one complaint (which I could care less about also) is that the line is a little akward when it gets backed up into the entrance but sometimes runs also into the middle of the room.",

The choice of beans they use for their espresso have a rich, bold and intense flavor that'll leave you wanting more.   I live in Tempe and the drive there is definitely worth it.

Bring your latest novel, poetry, or your laptop, throw on your big-rimmed glasses, and order a delicious vegan pastry and a feelin'-fancy coffee, and be one of the cool kids in downtown Phoenix. You'll love the people watching and the food/drinks are great. This is a wonderful date location on a Friday night or a fabulous Saturday afternoon escape with your pals.  Seating can be hard to come by, especially if you're in a group of three or more, but it's worth being a seating shark. Love the pink couches.  The friendly service is great, and surprisingly, the crowd was baby-friendly! We brought my niece in (dressed in her hippest leggings and onesie, naturally), and people stopped to coo at her and tell her what a good baby she was--i.e. smiling and laughing the whole two hours we were there. Hipsters have hearts, too. Who knew?",

I was there last week on a Sunday afternoon having some darn good mimosas with a friend, and it wasn't too crowded.  The only downside I've experienced is it can be a bit confusing where to order for food and cocktails during the day.  If you go for the first time, don't be shy. Grab a cup of coffee and explore. As one of the earlier reviewers mentioned, you might get looks walking in like you shouldn't be there. Maybe it's your hair. Maybe you're displaying something that's not eco-friendly. Whatever, dude.

Don't know why it took me this long to write a review.  Great coffee drinks, coffee beans roasted in-house (contrary to Mister J.'s claim below - the roaster is to your right, in plain view, if you're standing in line).  I love the fact that other than a few standard items, the daily pastry/quiche/cookie selection is always changing and incredibly creative.  Please, please, PLEASE make the homemade banana & nutella pop tarts again!  Great breakfast - I highly recommend the egg sandwich with applewood smoked bacon and roasted tomatoes.  One Lux's lesser-known strengths is its cocktail bar.  Drop in for a drink at night and I promise you will be pleasantly surprised.  They don't have a drink menu - you just tell them what you like and what you normally drink and one of their talented and creative bartenders will whip up something for you.  Every time I've ordered a drink it's been different than the last and equally impressive.  All that aside, the real hallmark of Lux is the staff.  Everybody is incredibly warm, genuine, friendly, and helpful.  Despite being constantly busy, if you visit this place regularly it won't be long before the staff greets you by name.  The only gripe I regularly hear about Lux is that it is constantly busy/crowded.  This may seem self-evident to me, but it's usually a good sign when a restaurant is heavily patronized so regularly.  Drop by Lux if you're in the neighborhood, you won't be disappointed.",

There's always plenty of room on the street a block over if the lot is full.  As pretty much everyone else has mentioned, the place is oozing with hipsters. It can be irritating, but it didn't really ruin my overall experience. My husband had a piece of quiche, which he really liked, and I thought the brioche was good - not too sweet, and a good portion size. The lattes are pretty good, though a little overpriced. Not the best latte I've had, but by no means the worse. The seating is interesting, though it's awkward to figure out where to pick up your drinks and food. We just watched what other people did and tried to follow suit as best we could. I think they want you to bus your dishes, but this was also unclear, I hope we put our dirty dishes in the right place. My experience with the staff was OK; everyone seemed pretty disinterested in what they were doing. Feigning a little interest in your customers is never a bad a thing, and is something I think the staff at Lux should work on.  I would go back to try their other drinks and pastries, but I'm not sure I want to call Lux my go to coffee shop in Phoenix quite yet.",

( although I like coming in just to chill) In my opinion, it masters all categories: coffee, breakfast/brunch, pastries ( scones, brownies, cake, croissants, quiches, donuts-some variety of whatever you can imagine-always tasty) lunch, dinner, and an excellent selection of alcoholic drinks. If you are into Bloody Marys, theirs is bomb! Excellent customer service- everyone is friendly. Although it's usually pretty crowded and the line can be long, staff will make sure your order is taken while you wait and they work very efficiently. Last week I had to wait a few extra minutes for my latte because someone grabbed it on accident so they gave me a punch card for a free drink! I have yet to have a bad service experience. Huge fan of this gem!",

Lux's coffee is some of my favorite and the whip cream is absolutely my favorite. Besides wi fi, coffee and tasty pastries, this coffee shop also serves up breakfast and lunch but the choices are minimal. However, the food looks delicious but I have yet to have a meal here.

But the baristas are inconsistent, there is always a line 20 miles long, and the my dirty chai latte is always and I repeat, always lack luster...   It's beautiful inside and if you like standing around waiting for a place to sit or crowded around the register then this is the place for you! The decor is shabby chic which I love and the teal typewriters give such a cool touch. The small windows inside allow the light to shine in, just so. If you do so manage find a seat, this is the kind of place you want to sit and write music or to your diary, sketch, or do something of an artistic nature. AKA hipster heaven.   Breakfast here is really good though. I go to church across the street and sometimes we stop in here after for a bite. The bacon and eggs with a croissant are the perfect little tummy fill for a day of meandering around midtown.   The thing I really appreciate about Lux (and what ultimately bumps it to 4 stars for me) is that they are a late night coffee stop. While most of the shops in the cenpho area close their doors at 7, you will continue to find the lights on at Lux.",

The ambiance is, like, textbook hipster, I think.  Some rugged wood, funky lamps, deviant art and coffee.  Not to mention a few fedora hats, skinny jeans and beards (but those weren't exclusive to the establishment).  I dug it.  Price. Eh, steep, but not too bad.  The food was delicious.  I got the savory pancake and it was totally not what I had envisioned, but it was awesome and I would so get it again.  Service was friendly and customer positive.  The one thing I didn't like was their pick up system.  I didn't know what I was supposed to do.  It was loud, so I didn't know if we'd hear our names or not.  We stood near the counter but somehow still missed our drinks.  Apparently they got cold so they set them aside (understood), but I don't know how we didn't hear them...so, yeah, the system didn't work for us.  Otherwise, the folks met are needs and were totally cool when we asked where our teas were.  Worth trying, and we might go back (I'm not a frequent anywhere...except my own kitchen).",

Other reviews are accurate that this place is hipster. It reminds me of Dunn Bros in St. Paul, MN. If I lived in Phoenix, I'd probably want to hang out here. I found the staff incredibly rude and had two of them tell me to get out of the way. It could have been a bad day for them but it soured my experience. The folks hanging out looked cool and I loved my latte. My bf enjoyed his regular coffee too. I asked what kind they have and they said, \"light\" and \"dark\" roasts. I was looking for a country or some other identifier but never feel like fussing too much. I'm not sure if I'd give it another chance on my next swing through town.",

    "text": "A couple weeks before a recent trip to Phoenix, I saw a picture of a delicious-looking Bloody Mary somebody posted on Facebook. I saw that it came from a place called Lux Central in Phoenix, and when I looked it up on Yelp I noted its strong reviews and determined to eat there when I was in town. I dragged my husband across town with promises of brunch, not realizing the place was more of a coffee shop with food and booze than an actual restaurant.  We walked in and took a lap around the space, noting the lack of tables, and the near absence of available chairs. I don't think I've ever seen so many people with laptops in a coffee shop all at once, and I hail from L.A., land of the Starbucks screenplay. I liked the vibe of the place--pretty hip, even strikingly hipster, especially by Phoenix standards. Eclectic furniture, lots of art on the walls. There was a register for coffee, pastries, and hot food, and a separate bar in the back. We were looking to have more of a sit-down brunch, and actually left to go to Pane Bianco instead, only to find that there wasn't much for my picky husband to eat (no pizza at lunch). We circled back and ordered food and cocktails at the bar, then seated ourselves at a communal table.  Service, at least, was excellent. Our bartender, a young dude with blondish hair, acted as our waiter, too--wish I'd gotten his name, because he was helpful and friendly and generally wonderful. He ordered our food for us and brought it out, along with our drinks. He also made fantastic cocktails. I got my Bloody Mary and it was totally worth the journey. I have no idea what went into it, but it was spicy and flavorful, with depth and complexity, an umami bomb of a Bloody Mary in a mason jar with salt-frosted rim. Didn't hurt that it came garnished with pickled asparagus, green bean, and carrot, along with jalapeno slices and a fistful of candied bacon--out of control delicious. There was no cocktail menu, but our bartender asked what my husband was in the mood for, and fixed him a beautiful, balanced Aviation--a lavender-colored cocktail with gin, creme de violette, maraschino liqueur, and lemon juice, garnished with a fancy cocktail cherry.  The food was less exciting, but serviceable enough. I had Aunt Ida's Biscuits and Gravy. The biscuits were buttery with a nice crumble, and I liked the hearty sausage gravy. My husband got some toast with butter and jam, and supplemented that with a croissant. He wasn't particularly impressed with any of it.  I wouldn't necessarily recommend Lux Central for its food, but it's a cool coffee shop with a knockout bar. I'd love to come back for another round of drinks next time I'm in Phoenix. I just wouldn't show up looking for a sit-down meal on an empty stomach.",

My most recent visit I had a take out oder placed and they forgot to put my order in so after 20 min. they finally put in though....the staff was not apologetic and they are a bit rude.

Everyone here is so chill and relaxed. The place has a total hipster vibe. We got the chocolate chip cookie, sweet cheese croissant, jalapeno & bacon mac and cheese, and the hibiscus tea. Everything was really good and at a good price! The cookie was only $1.50 and the croissant was $3. The tea also has free refills! I do wish the pastries were heated up though, but they were still delicious. I'll definitely be coming back to try the coffee though! We sat there for a few hours working on homework and doing some blogging so this is definitely a good place to come to be productive! The only bad thing is that there are a lot of seating areas with really dim lighting and it got a little too hot inside. Other than that, we totally recommend this place!",

Any time later than that, we would have been waiting in line forever and probably not able to find a seat.  We ordered Aunt Glady's egg and bacon plate.  The bacon is to die for!  It's crispy, yet moist, and loaded with smoked flavor.  I think the $13 price tag for that dish is a little steep, however.  We each ordered a blueberry muffin.  The top layer of the muffin was almost sugar cookie in texture.  The muffins were loaded with blueberries.  They paired perfectly with my creamy latte.  My husband wanted a cold brew coffee, but they only have cold brew for $6 in bottles.  That's pretty steep for a small amount of cold brew.  They said that if you bring the bottle back, they'll give you a refill for $3, but that didn't entice us.  He ordered an iced coffee instead, which he really enjoyed. The seating is quirky and there are a lot of areas that would probably be difficult to sit at and eat a meal due to the tables being very small and the seating not being conducive to eating off a plate.",

This was our experience: You wait in line, order at the counter, give your name, and stand around with about five to ten other customers packed like sardines at the other end of the counter waiting to hear your name.  This is the same end where other customers are waiting for their hot food, getting napkins, silverware, sugar for their coffee, etc.  Well, my name was never called, nor were the names of a few other annoyed customers.  You then have to squirm your way through the mayhem to find out if your name and/or order was missed?  The biscuit and gravy was good.  Though small in portion and overpriced.  The egg bacon sandwich was good but not hot.  It was \"lukewarm\" at best.  My scone was dry and crumbly.  My velvet latte was hot and very good.  I'll never come back.  Second time here. I wanted to give it another chance.  Part of what I pay for when I go out is to feel relaxed and welcomed.  The other part is to have outstanding service, food, and drink.  We didn't get any of that here.  Granted we were here on a Saturday morning but c'mon to be that disorganized, have no seating ( a whole entire table and bench area was reserved by one guy sitting there) for your customers, and only offer a tiny area where your customers are required to wait, get water, get condiments, wait for tables to open up, etc. is just plain ridiculous.",

The music was decent but too loud for me.  Walking in there gave me anxiety because I had no idea where to order, what to order and once I was given the menu I felt extremely rushed.  The drink was just OK, I wish I would have had more of a chance to look at the menu but I just felt like I was in the way.  Once I found a seat I was so uncomfortable I ended up leaving to a different, quieter coffee shop.  I appreciate what the place is and should I have a friend come into town and we just want to go in to grab a drink and chat I may go back but at this time all I need is decent chair, an electric outlet and some good coffee and I'll be good to go.",

There is more space to study, meet a friend for coffee or just grab a seat to catch up on reading. The ambiance is great and I really love that there are a variety of places to sit. I usually grab a lemonade or an Americano. The lemonade is tart and fresh, but with one packet of sugar... it is PERFECT. The Americanos are strong and taste delicious. I have been coming here to study lately and there is a room in the back that is usually on the more quiet side. This place also has the best tasting vegan cinnamon sugar donut that I have ever had! True, I have never had a vegan donut before, but this one is fab.   If you are looking to have an adult beverage, they have that too and third Thursdays seem to be more of a social crowd.",

However, I frequent Lux because its truly one of the best coffeehouses in Phoenix.  Reliable wifi, lots of seating (though good lord, good luck getting a seat during their busiest times), delicious pastries, drinks and foodstuffs.  I like to swing by on a weeknight if I need to focus on a project due at the office or sometimes for mornings that I telecommute.  Full bar, places to plug my laptop in and generally a nice busy, lively vibe.  I will say that occasionally the evening music is either too loud or seems inappropriate.  But maybe I'm just getting old and not used to hearing a full Method Man\\Redman album played at a coffee shop...  BTW, did I mention the mac and cheese w/ bacon is out of this world??",

We went here on a Saturday morning while we were out exploring, and it was pretty crowded. This is a get to know your neighbor type of place. Unless your neighbor is set up at a table with an iMac, in which case don't get chatty.

It was made of oatmeal and surely some secret ingredient (CRACK) that made it taste so good. The adorable brunette with bangs got the drink out FAST which was good because there were a lot of impatient coffee \"connoisseurs\" waiting in line behind Chester.   Chester thinks the adorable baristas made a poopy day much better. The girl up front gave him such a nice complement and didn't rush Chester like they do at Sh*tbucks. It's amazing what a smile and good cup of coffee can do for Chesters' mental health. Thank you, Lux lady.   Iced coffee, service, people watching, and vegan cookies are very good in Chester's humble opinion.",

My latte was probably the best I have ever had and my biscuit and gravy was awesome! Service was great, they were all friendly and helped us with what we needed.  As I mentioned, the staff was amazing. Some coffee staff tend to be a little hard to get used to but the staff at Lux made you feel comfortable and were very friendly. Unfortunately, I was very displeased with the manager. I went in a couple days later to ask a question and he was horribly rude to me. Honestly makes me want to question returning to Lux.    And that is why I give a solid 3 stars.. Out of all people you think you may have a horrible experience with, the manager is always the LAST on my mind.",

I can never tell if people are in line, looking at the HUGE display of tasty pastries, or waiting for their drink. There is often so much going on in the small ordering area but after a few visits, I see it more as a small space that builds connections/community.   Normally, I order a regular black coffee or iced coffee. It's good here, but what really shines for them are their espresso drinks! The black and white, the caramel, the velvet...all sooooo good! They have alot of different choices too so make sure not to miss their menu board, which, unfortunately is kind of easy to miss. Don't be shy, just ask! It's easy to get scooted quickly in and out of the ordering mix, but just be confident. Everyone's super nice and willing to help!   The atmosphere is really hip and trendy too, so make sure to order your drink to enjoy on the premise. Enjoy your drink with friends, or a really good book, or meet someone new!",

You have completely outdone yourself and everyone else man!  If you are someone who either has never been to Lux or haven't been in a long while, then you MUST GO (and go again and again and again to take it all in).

The staff makes you feel welcome and the food is not to be missed. Ask for a craft cocktail and you will get something that you've probably never heard of before, but it'll quickly become something you are ordering at the next place you have a drink.  I try to take everyone that comes from out of town to visit here, and I have yet to hear someone say it was a bad choice.",

This place is pretty small so I can understand why it is packed, but it was not comfortable to sit and enjoy myself. The tables are super tall, so I felt like I was reaching up to type on my laptop. The coffee was  at least decent. I got a caramel latte, except she made it iced, but it was still OK. I probably won't return to this location ever again.",

I will admit, it took me a cool 5 times coming here to realize there was a back, I thought it was crowded and didn't even care because of the vibes this place has. I left AZ on and off over the next few years and rave about this place to everyone I have an encounter with that the conversation of coffee comes up. Now I am back in PHX, and my girlfriend left for Cali early for Thanksgiving; I have been here every day since Saturday and for almost all day each day. I sit, I do my work, I drink coffee, eat my meals here; I don't even know how much I have spent over the last 3.5 days and I don't even care (probably close to like $80 once you include tip). The environment makes me feel at home and as I get to know the staff more I'm more excited to come back. Having met the owner I see where the place gets it's chill from. He's cool as hell and wears sunglasses indoors. If you didn't know he was the owner you'd look at him and just go \"yeah he belongs here\", Which is cool because the attitude of relaxed, focused and productive bibes radiates through the place. I use to not even think the coffee was that great, but it's even improved significantly. the food is prime and I recommend anyone try anything on the menu, you won't be disappointed. The Mac & Cheese is yes the most popular, but venture because the entire menu is great and I'm slowly checking item after item off (like I said, I eat my meals here).",

    "text": "Seriously. I come here so much for a good couple hours to study to abuse the real value of the Hibiscus iced tea with unlimited refills and munch on some home-made pastries, cookies, or whatever they make. I like to think that their food is home-made food, but with the slight disadvantage of missing the comfort of your PJ's. I wish I knew about this place before when I went to a certain girls college prep near here...  Here's some hacks:  It can get crowded, especially on Saturdays and Sundays for brunch. Come super super early (the ARE open a at 6, but 8 is a good time) for fresh-baked goodness. You can also come later, from 5:30 onwards night to avoid crowds and delicious options for dinner.   Lux is open till 2AM on Friday and Saturday, and on every other day of the week, it is open till 12. (The bar is only open from midnight to 2 however, not the main stuff.)  You can ask for a dollop of Nutella with their fresh baked croissants. Perfect little breakfast. Also, their whipped cream is unique, dense, rich and amazing.  I sometimes get a white hot chocolate, usually during the 'colder' months. It isn't on the menu, but you can ask for it. It's a delectable sweet treat, with perfect foam. :)   Their hot teas really aren't that good, but their iced teas are great. You can get refills for their simple coffees, tea and their iced teas. It's probably a sin that I haven't been as interested in their coffee, since coffee gives me tummy aches. Alas.   HOWEVER, PRETTY MUCH ALL OF THEIR FOOD IS GOOD!! Their food changes daily, so my rule of thumb is, if you see it and think you'll like it, get it, because you might not see it again for a while. Their delicate honey lavender shortbread haunts my sweet dreams...  Go into Lux with an open heart and it will never fail you.",

I'm not going to be one of those people who bitches about price, but what I will say is for that price you should do a whole lot better. I was in Vancouver, BC. The Canadian Loonie is worth 0.75. So, I could pay 5 Loonie (approx $3.75 USD) for something that was a 5 star drink. I paid $6 for a 4.5 star drink at Lux. A great drink, but not worth it to be frank. I'm splitting hairs because of the high cost of coffee.  I compare it to the cost of gas. It seems to be going up and up.  I stopped drinking coffee about a month ago, but I had a cup on a recent trip to Vancouver, and because it was so appealing at this one shop.  Looks like I'll be stopping again as to not get hooked back into the cycle of spending so much money on the luxury item and the people who charge this amount because they can.",

I felt like we had to lurk around for seats like the old lady at a casino (yes, that is a friends reference) looking for the lucky slot machine.   Came around dinner time, and the big table in the back was reserved, which is perfectly reasonable.  Even though there are multiple nooks and crannies in the establishment, many of the seats were occupied by non-paying customers on their laptops. We were trying to figure out where to sit, but kept getting angry glares since guests are pretending this is a silent library and not a business.   Okay college students, we surrender.  We were forced to enjoy our hot drinks in the outdoor patio, and with the 100 degree heat & second-hand smoke...like the place; hate the patrons.",

It has been on my bucket list of coffee shops to visit and I finally got around to it when my husband and I stopped by twice in the past month. The parking situation is a mess, but all parking downtown is cramped so I can't fault them for that. The outside is rather inconspicuous and has a small but decent sized patio. The inside is a little deceiving on space as there are two sides of the place. If the front is super crowded, swing around to the other side where there is more space. The line sometimes goes out the door but it is worth the wait.   The first visit, we both ordered iced vanilla lattes. We sat at one of the communal tables and enjoyed our delicious drinks. It was fascinating to simply people watch and see the delicious looking food the kitchen was pumping out.  Everything looked so good, we decided we had to come back for breakfast. Thus, a few weeks later, we came back for the second time. This time we both ordered hot vanilla lattes and two orders of the biscuits and gravy with a side of bacon. DELICIOUS! The biscuits were fluffy and carried the gravy perfectly. The gravy was the perfect thickness, both flavorful and peppery. The two eggs were cooked over easy (as ordered) and the side of bacon was just so good! It was thick, cooked perfectly crisp, and so flavorful. It was a little spicy/peppery, but I loved it.   Overall, we had a great breakfast and the coffee is fantastic. I would highly recommend Lux and will definitely be back.",

When you walk in there's not really a sign as to where you order but almost always you will see  a line next to the amazing array of pastries so that's your clue. Lux is your hipster, chill and sit together as a family with strangers you don't know kinda spot. You will find yourself wanting to order all bad things for breakfast, just do it! Breakfast at Lux I recommend it all, honestly. The vanilla iced latte was perfect and beats any coffee giant on flavor. If your wanting to stop in for a light dinner and bottle of wine, I recommend ordering the Mac and cheese it's a must! If you happen to go to the bathroom don't be scared by all the graffiti on the walls, most of it is inspirational.",

I've never been here when it wasn't super packed and bustling but have still always been able to find a quieter spot to study or get work done in one of the back rooms. They have a huge case of treats with a few vegan options and sell homemade granola and protein bars if you want something healthier/gluten free. They also have a menu with brunchy type food which is really good and reasonably priced for the quality.  For drinks, I usually just get a latte with almond milk since the coffee is so good here it doesn't even need syrup or flavoring but I also really love their dirty chai lattes (they make their own chai blend and it's super spicy with lots of cinnamon!).  If you're looking for a trendy coffee spot, this is definitely the shop for you!",

You used to be able to sit down and enjoy the quiet ambiance, just relax, enjoy their AMAZING coffee maybe get in a little bit of good people watching. These days it is something else entirely, its a place just to go to be a part of the boring mainstream crowd full of its crass individuals just vying for the attention of their equally dumbstruck peers. This is fully evidenced by the mere change that any time I have ordered a macchiato their server feels it obligatory to ask if I \"know they don't make it like starbucks\". My god....what has the crowd become. Fortunately their are still coffee shops around that have a more dignified atmosphere worthy of the fine brews within. I know this is no fault of lux itself and they truly brew a great cuppa' but still, stars down for the loss of a once great spot.",

It's pretty happily have a good choice of seating throughout the restaurant area they even have a TV room or you can watch basketball and sports they have awesome culture. All different types of people calm located in a great area my only downside to this place is the parking. I literally almost got killed by some lady who thought I was taking her spot but I was leaving the parking lot and people are nuts about their parking in this place there's maybe 15 parking spots for the entire place. And I think that might even be shared with another place. anyways. That's the only downside I can think of other ways I highly recommend this place bring your coffee connoisseurs because this place will definitely meet the mark! :)",

    "text": "I know Lux does great coffee. It's a cool hang-out. The pastries look awesome, and the whole place has a great vibe. But some things from my 2nd visit in 5 years. 1) I walk in, clearly looking like a fish out of water (couldn't remember how to get in) - you're on duty filling bags with beans looking super mad you have to do it. Tip: everyone can see you're mad. No need to make me feel any more awkward than I already do, and continue to ignore me whilst continuing to look fabulously vexed. 2) When I ask what's on the coffee bean menu and state that I have my own machine, just no means to grind the beans, that YOUR cue to tell me what you have. Not look disinterested and brush me off so you can go do something, anything else. I pick-up the ONLY bag of beans I can see on the counter (single origin stuff), besides the espresso beans being bagged by the aforementioned disgruntled staffer - \"are these the only single origin beans you have?\" Yes. I mean, hint hint! Tell me what else you have!!! I know you're fairly full-up, most seats taken, work is hard, long day, blah blah blah, but come oooooooon. I get ripped for drinking Starbucks; first time off the Corporate Reservation and I get the faceless face palm of 'not interested'. Worse. I was too embarrassed to ask the price of the beans and got busted $20 on the Zampian (I've had Kopi Luwak for only a little more expensive). Just put the price on the bags (please). Of course, none of this would have been an issue if there had been some semblance of customer service present. Depressing :(",

I've drank a lot of jacked up Americanos in this life, and to be handed a drink that's rich and satisfying and distinctive is a rare treat. For this and this alone, it gets five stars. I've heard that the food is good, but I wasn't interested.  DOWNSIDES: crowded as hell. Parking is insufficient. Music is loud, and combined with the people, it forms a incoherent droning sound that can make it difficult to understand what's being said. If you were looking for a meaningful place to have a conversation, maybe skip it, because you'll frequently craning forward to ask people to repeat themselves.   In a different town, I might call this 4 stars. But it's the exactly what it needs to be in the place where it belongs.",

However, there was no place to sit inside, so we sat outside with the dirty, old tables and half working chairs. I tried to not pay much attention to that and see how the food was. When I got my breakfast I was expecting a well presented dish but instead I had a burnt, McDonald's looking McMuffin and to top it off I got a small cup of coffee with the coffee splattered all over the cup. I gave it a 3/5 because I liked the environment and the music that was playing, Lux is probably a nice place to gather with your friends for a dessert.",

    "text": "Such a cute cafe located in downtown Phoenix! I dropped twice, once to just grab a quick latte, and the second time to grab some food and caffeine!   First off, I had a bit of a hard time finding the entrance the first time after parking in the front. The second time, I parked in the back and was able to walk to the door more easily. Once inside, I was met with a line both times, but was happy to see that it moved pretty fast. During my most recent visit, they also started grabbing drink orders while people were in line so that they could get started on those more quickly. I settled on a black and white with whipped cream and a savory dutch pancake.   Now the black and white was deeelicious, especially the whipped cream! The savory dutch pancake was super rich and buttery and made me really want to try the sweet version next time!   Overall, such a cute cafe with a really unique interior -- drop by if you're in the area and want some coffee/pastries/food/cocktails!",

Lux on their own has a great list of libations, but my favorite thing is to ask Samuel to create a beverage based on the drink profile/flavors I am wanting. Every drink is crafted with experience and intense flavors. Simply amazing.   For food, the Mac and Cheese with Jalapeno and Bacon added is one of my favorite cheat meals. The cheese is so creamy and rich, it's just delightful.   Lux has a fun, busy atmosphere. It is not uncommon for this place to be packed so know that if you have to wait, it's worth it.",

The vegan donut was super fancy and just the right amount of sweet. The real winner was their mixed berry bar with a hint of tartness and varied textures. I highly recommend the desserts.  They even have lunch and dinner menus. I love that the place is open from 6 am- midnight. It's kind of a place for early risers and night owls. The servers seem friendly enough and though the pricing is a bit on the high side I found that the quality of everything was worth it. I really love the different seating areas all over the building. It looks small but that is deceiving. The eclectic array of chairs, tables and couches will be sure to let you find your own space. It definitely feels like a slice of Tucson in Phoenix. I missed the slightly hipster vibe and I got it here.",

The coffee is great, the pastries are great, the tea is great, and the food is great. They're known for their macaroni and cheese, and you can never go wrong with ordering a pesto mac and cheese with bacon and having a cold iced tea on the side. Or if you want alcohol with your mac and cheese, they serve that as well! Different beers and cocktails to choose from at the bar area.  Overall this place is great and has always been there for me when it came to studying for finals, midterms, and the bar exam. I am definitely going to continue coming here. They close pretty late which is a plus!  Only downside is that it can get crowded, and parking sucks. Overall if you can come at the right time, this is the perfect place to be if you want to get work done, or just relax.",

    "text": "LUX RUNS MY LIFE.  No truly, I lived in Phoenix for five years after moving from Seattle area... aka the mecca of all coffee, and home of the legendary mermaid logo coffee we shall not name. I had the hardest transition finding a quality local coffee shop, that I actually enjoyed and didn't feel like I was \"settling\" for. Most coffee in the Phoenix area is watered down, acidic, or underwhelming. After over a year of searching, and an upwards of 20 coffee shops, I found the gem that is Lux Central.  Not only is their coffee just the right balance of flavor, it never gives me that dreaded acidic coffee stomachache - AKA True craftsmanship and quality. Not to mention their food is serious drool-worthy!   I highly recommend the black and white coffee (white and regular chocolate mocha) iced - even though I don't love sweet coffee this drink has a place in my heart. Their whip cream is in-house made and unlike any other I have had... and like I said, I don't do sweets but I'd order a full cup of this whip cream.  For food, I cannot sing enough praises of their mac and cheese, and also their chorizo biscuits and gravy! GIMME THEM CARBS.  The ambiance is hip and trendy, with ever evolving art - but expect a NY vibe. This crowd isn't here to be your bestie, and the wait is long! Get in line, be ready with your order, and most of all ENJOY! Have a B&W for me, as this spot as my most missed place since I moved away.",

My favorite cookie is their paleo almond chocolate chip! I got so excited when they started offering paleo treats. They even have a breakfast and lunch menu with different specials daily. Really quality food you can tell they put love into everything they make.   Of course the coffee is great! I typically order a dirty chai latte or a matcha latte with almond milk.  There is also a bar where cute cocktails are served. I usually choose this place when girlfriends ask to meet up for a coffee date.

I was there on a Saturday afternoon and there was a lot of seating available. The ladies room was clean.  There were some dirty dishes scattered around the place, but it was busy and I didn't really care- they were all picked up by the time we left.  There were a few hipsters in there, but my conservative suburbanite parents felt very comfortable in there as well.    My only qualm was the lack of a menu and pricing.  If my friend hadn't recommended the Velvet I would've been totally clueless, and possibly disappointed.  While I was waiting in line I even pulled out my phone to check if their website had a menu, but couldn't find anything.  In the restaurant I could only find a list of teas (on a small piece of paper right by the register), and alcoholic beverages (on the glass wall).  Maybe I just wasn't looking in the right spot.

Went here the other night for the first time to check out their cocktails and it was a little strange at first to order cocktails without a menu but the staff there ask you what types of drinks you like and then just make something for you. I had two cocktails, one called the grapefruit (the had absolutely no grapefruit in it.. but tasted just like it!) the second cocktail was a mixed berry mojito, both were very tasty. The jalapeno mac was outstanding as well. Can't wait to go back.",

But it's still really chill, not loud typically- maybe on the weekends; they do have a couple rooms, just in case you want to have more privacy. They also have a coffee bar, a full bar and a kitchen that does a wonderful Risotto! The vibe here is always chill as well, from the patrons to the staff. And it's nice to know that even if you are coming in late (as long as it's before 12) you can still get quality food, and they are happy to bring it to you! Always a favourite, thanks guys!",

My only initial concern was is this going to be an authentic place or some hipster wanna be establishment. In the article the owner wanted to expand (money) but talked about knowing all his customers in an intimate way. Kinda had me worried. dont really like talking to people unless they are authentic about it.  The place looks great, real industrial feel. lots of room and different decor which is probably by design. Variety of people too from tree huggers, businessman, moms with tots and a gay crowd. Pretty cool.   Good coffee, very average scone. Great service. enjoyed hanging out for a couple of hours. Even saw the owner and he didnt approach anyone. He's hard not to notice. He's got the cool guy glasses and hipster pants on. Must have read some serious shakespeare that day.  looking forward to checking out the drinks and food at night.",

Yes, there was a couple of clusters of iMac-bearing-no-eye-contact-having folks but once I made my way to the bar, the crowd got more social. Young and old, everyone seemed to be enjoying their artfully crafted beverages and eclectic atmosphere. The music was good, the food was delicious, and in addition to all their fancy, herbal-infused mixed drinks, they house a wide variety of craft beers. Overall a great experience. Looking forward to trying out their coffee & breakfast next time.",

I wish I could have gotten something to eat because they had a whole bakery in there. Its probably a college students dream.   Overall I'd say : Solid... I'd be a regular.

The coffee and food are great, the staff is great, environment is great, music is good, and an overall relaxing place to catch up with a friend.   Whenever I go there, I order a medium mocha latte. Very reasonable price since it comes in a large cup. They also add latte art, sometimes making hearts or a rosetta. Which is a plus for me.  I went here with my girlfriend for our one year anniversary breakfast. I had two eggs scrambled with bacon and hash browns. The bacon was amazing. It was THICK with that crisp and flavorful addition to it. The eggs were seasoned with peppers and salt to perfection. The hash browns had the right amount of fluff and crunch. My girlfriend had the egg sandwich bacon tomato cheddar and egg. She enjoyed it. It was a tiny bit messy because of the egg, however satisfying overall.   Sometimes it can be crowded, with people on their laptops studying or relaxing. They have a large projection screen in the back that usually has a football game and extra table seating nearby.   Overall, I recommend visiting Lux and enjoying their selection of coffees and teas. They also serve some alcoholic beverages at the bar, if you prefer that kind of drink. They have multiple snacks, like muffins and cookies you can munch on as well. My experience is always great when I come here.",

We try to avoid coming here on weekends as it's packed, though we do get lucky with seating and parking.  One criticism I have of the place is that the layout is pretty chaotic. Sometimes you're literally stepping over other people's babies in their baby carrier trying to avoid them, or bumping into people holding plates and hot drinks. That, and despite being crowded, people just linger and sit around for long periods of time.   But for the most part, I love the food, drinks and ambiance. And I love that it's a more youthful crowd.

Great place to get some work done, and bump into some friendly like minded individuals.    The reason I didn't give this place 5 stars is because the coffee that I got on my second round was not the best and there is no cover on the patio.    Today it rained all day and as rare as that is, I feel a covered patio is even more coveted in the hot summer months.  I believe a coffee shop should have a covered patio.  As a coffee bar, I wish the coffee was better, not saying it is bad, just not the best.    Overall, liked Lux and will definitely work here again as I just relocated to the Downtown Phoenix area.",

Once inside though, it's cute, but a little dungeon-ish. Not too much natural light in this concrete cave of a building. Their americano is pretty bomb, I haven't had any of the lattes but people seem to like their tea based drinks here.

    "text": "Absolutely love\"D\" this place  Unfortunately, the last time I was there with my father I was very disappointed. My father has been coming here for a few years here and there. I, myself, had been there almost twice a week since I moved to the downtown area in January. My father and I had been there twice previously together and had a wonderful time, although this time was different. My father is a deputy sheriff in a different county and was in town briefly for a class he was taking to become a better peace officer, he just happened to come straight from class and had his county polo on as well as his firearm holstered. The whole cafe, including the staff gave dirty looks and multiple rude comments were made, one, as we were leaving being \"Oh, is she under arrest.\" Completely opposite from the other million times I had been previously, Not one person greeted us positively or flashed a smile back. I have never before in my life felt so sad and disrespected AND I WAS NOT THE ONE WHO SHOULD HAVE EVEN FELT SO. My father never once said anything or engaged. Sad to say I will not be going back to this establishment",

    "text": "I love going here. I really, really do, just to have that said off the bat. But there are some important things to understand about Lux.  1) Seating is always limited. Not even on a Tuesday night in July will this place be quiet and empty. Own that fact, love it, and keep looking.  2) The cocktails are phenomenal. There's no list of specialty cocktails. They go by requests for what you like, and make something that percolates in their brains all quick like. They also use beautiful glassware, which is really nice when you think about how rare that is.  3) It's actually kind of unfortunate that the cocktails eclipse the food. Lux is probably some of the best food you can get at its price point. If you think $19 for a steak is too much, just order it and keep in mind you'd pay $25 for cooking on that order at any other establishment. The same goes for literally everything else their fabulous cooks prepare. You can't go wrong with the soup, and I assure you the mac & cheese is a full meal.  4) They actually have newspapers! Real ones that you hold with your hands for the patrons to enjoy and leave behind! That basically makes Lux one of the most active town halls in the city of Phoenix.  5) They play full albums of good music, and not just rando indie bands people brag about having heard of. This is a place that appreciates Beyonce as much as all those weird bands whose names you can't remember.  There are a lot of things I don't understand about Lux. I don't get why people take selfies with their lattes. I don't understand why they have a DJ, but I'm glad he has a regular gig. I don't understand  why there are non-functional typewriters strewn about the place. But you know what? I keep coming back. We all keep coming back.",

I've recently been here twice and had the spaghetti squash entree cooked in two different ways, both incredibly delicious. I dined with someone who ordered a fantastic steak, really tasty. They have a large selection of wonderful pastries.  They actually provide service after one has transacted their purchase at the counter. We felt like there was wait staff, and because tips have already been placed in the jar or added to a credit/debit card, these people aren't  just hoping for a bigger tip.  The ambiance is pretty close to perfection. Patrons working at a table make room for others, background music is nice, not annoying, the dinnerware is beautiful. (I just dined off of a plate from Anthropologie.) Close to museums, near the light rail ... My favorite place for any meal or beverage in Phoenix.",

I also always recommended this place with my entire network who also consistently started going as well. Unfortunately, today when I asked to get an ice tea refill (which is free and I have got one before from other employee) one of the employees shouted and asked if I have the receipt and disrespect me in front of all the people in line. I usually don't get hurt from things like this but this time it seemed like she had some kind of HATE towards me. She later pulled me aside and mentioned that some of her coworkers said some more things about me whichs why she was heated. She made up some rules who are written nowhere and were never mentioned to me about \"ice tea refill\", she apologized and offered me a free drink which I refused to, u don't buy me with a free drink after you made me look like an homless. I should also mention that I have an accent and many time when I go to order some of the employees there behave in a very RACIST way towards me and laugh at me. It's a shame that she treated me like I'm inferior to her, I left the store and will probably never go back.",

DON'T RELY ON ANYTHING YOU ARE TOLD OR YOU WILL LEARN THE HARD WAY THAT NOTHING AT VASEO IS AS GOOD AS THEY CLAIM AND THEY ONLY ACKNOWLEDGE WHAT IS IN WRITING!   I moved my family to Vaseo after taking the nice tour with a very friendly woman who told us about all kinds of amenities and activities that Vaseo had to offer. In our move,it was most important to us that we find a place with 24 hour pool and gym access because we work odd hours and we were also looking for a place that had a pool that was heated in the winter so we could exercise all year round as we had both of those things at our last apartment and they were on our had to have list. We were told that there were 4 pools at Vaseo and that one of the pools was heated year round so we were sold. Then, we tried to swim in the pool in October, it was bone numbing cold, my skin turned beat red, and my body movements slowed. I called to ask about the heat in the pool and they originally told me that they don't start to heat the heated pool until November. Went back in November and there was no change in temp and then I was told they only heat their pool to 70 degrees (actually about 60-65), which in no way can be considered a \"heated pool\" because a heated pool standard temp is 85 degrees None of the employees know where the temperature switch is and they have no thermometers in any of the pools. I don't think the heated pool even has a heater.They have several hot tubs at Vaseo but they only heat them to around 80 degrees when the standard hot tub temperature is usually 100-102 degrees, so there's usually a ton of unsupervised kids jumping in and out of the hot tubs because the hot tub is more like a warm bath. Oh ya, as it turns out, the pools all close at 10pm instead of being available 24 hours as we were told, and this is the only thing the security squad seems to enforce like Martial Law.Very disappointing since all the things we moved here for were promised and never delivered. One good thing about Vaseo is the Happy Hour that they host about 8 times a year and welcome everyone to come and eat and drink and meet their neighbors. Its usually free and its a pretty cool thing to do. It doesn't quite make up for all the problems they create and the poor management of the complex, but it is something.",

Due to this duality Lux always seems to be a busy place, allowing guests to work on their laptops or chat with thief friends. Durning the morning they offer locally baked goods and a small breakfast/brunch menu. Their coffee is well brewed, roasted on site, and seems to be the coffee of choice for many restaurants in the Central Corridor area. In the evening the bar area comes to life and offers a wide variety of delicious cocktails served in original old school glassware. In addition to the cocktails the bar also offers an interesting selection of craft beers by the bottle or can.",

    "text": "I went to Lux for brunch with some friends and the food was pretty good. First off, the line was REALLY long, which is both good and bad. Bad, for obvious reasons, but good because it tells you that they are popular, which would usually hint at the quality of the food you will eventually consume.   Second, they are kind enough to get drink orders while you wait in line so that you can start having your coffee, tea, juice, or whatnot, while you wait for your food. Third, the decor of Lux was cool enough to distract me while my friends and I waited for our breakfast to be prepared. Lots of retro-looking lamps on the tables combined with art from local artists made for a warm and welcoming atmosphere.   When our food did arrive, we were all satisfied! I got the Aunt Gladys's homemade salsa over four strips of tender belly bacon, three scrambled eggs, white cheddar, and hash, which was pretty delicious. My two friends also really enjoyed their meals. I'm giving them 4 stars because I did think that their food was a bit over-priced for what you got, both in portion size and quality. I mean, it was $5 for a glass of orange juice... Other than that, I was very satisfied with the experience.",

From the pride that shows in the service and the great food and coffee, I will be recommending this restaurant to friends and family.   The staff was so friendly and very helpful with me. If it's your first time, it can seem confusing but they quickly noticed I was a newbie and walked me through.   The atmosphere is one that meets the needs of many; business meetings, school work, social fun, etc. They've done a fine job making this a unique experience making me look forward to my next visit..of which will be really soon.   The menu looks incredible too. I started with a caramel latte which exceeded my expectations. So I couldn't help but order an odd combination of food; bacon and jalapeno mac and cheese, quiche, peanut butter cookies and corn bread/berries muffin....I had company. All of them were fantastic.  The mac & cheese is amazing!   I'll be back for sure!",

I love that they have a room where its noisy, a room with a TV and a quiet study room. In addition, there is a little outside seating area. Not a big fan because you are just looking at the parking lot, but it is Phoenix, so I didn't expect much. Usually I can't study when there is a lot of noise, but for some reason I was able to get a lot of work done there. AND there is a lot of outlets and FREE fast WIFI.",

This is a popular joint and if you have all the time in the world by all means....give Lux a shot.  However, if you only have 1.5 hours to kill for breakfast head here.  Lux, do your fans a favor and give us table service.  Don't make us wait in a 20 min line for a coffee refill.  I did not mind the wait on day 1 because you were new to me and your space is interesting.

    "text": "This place was not a favorite of mine.  I was hoping this was going to be a great coffee joint.  It looked promising.   There was a line, a long line,  which shows that Phoenix is desperate for a place like this.  They had a good selection of baked goods (quiche and pastries).  They have other items to order, but, according to the person taking our order, the menu changes and they did have one to look at.  She had to tell us what else there was to order.  This takes time and holds up the already long line.  If I was just stopping in and did not know to ask, I would not have ordered anything.  I ordered a mocha, the quiche and a scone.  They offered to heat up my quiche... mistake and I will get to that.   The place to pay, pick up and fix up your coffee were in the same 5 or 6 foot square and with a line this long it got crowded quickly.  The other thing was that if you were not paying close attention you could miss you order.  They put the order out and call your name and that was it.  You then had to look over several drinks that look the same trying to sort out which is yours.   My coffee came out quickly.  Then my scone a few minutes later... not sure why it took so long to get a baked good from a plate to the counter.  My quiche was warming and took much too long. I was with my wife's cousin and his made to order breakfast came out just as quick as my scone and the quiche was almost 10 minutes later, it was only luke warm.  The scone (lemon poppy seed) was a little bland.  The quiche was... well see above and was only so-so.  The coffee was fine, but nothing special.  They want you to bus your dishes, but don't label the place to put the dishes.   They had a DJ for on a Friday morning was a bit much.  The music was also too loud for a morning coffee joint.  I should not have to tell a DJ to turn the music down at a coffee joint in the morning.  This was a place where people were working, reading and socializing... it is not a night club, even if it was jazz.  Another thing about the line... I actually saw several small groups leave after waiting too long.  The people who started Lux saw potential, but I don't think they know how to run a coffee shop.  Unfortunately this is the only True game in town and people are going to put up with this until someone opens the competition.",

Someone may happen in and have an almond milk latte, enjoy the leaf poured into the foam and maybe even let out a little hum of approval on the first sip. What they, and many others might miss is the subtle attention to what's important. Jeff, the owner, doesn't miss an opportunity to utilize premium products from the pastries to the furniture.   His kitchen staff works to provide sublime breakfast dishes, decadent pastries and savory dinner plates. Even with the constant line out the door they will do their best to remember your name and drink of choice.   I have been going here for years and with that experience can vouch for the most important achievement for any service based establishment. Consistency. Lux understands and executes the task of providing a premium experience and never lowering the bar. I give them 5 stars simply because that is all the stars I am allowed.",

And, if you go somewhere else, I won't have to worry about bumping anyone in the back or head as I make my way around to get coffee, find a magazine, power outlet or simply leave for the night.    Oh, and despite the excellence of the food - there's a Carls JR down the road. Save yourselves the wait and just go there.  Ya. So there's room for the rest of us.  Trust me, it is almost as entertaining to watch the short-order cooks of McDonald's chaotic endeavor to make your burger vs. the smooth staff here cook from scratch in their front-of-room kitchen.  With the bowls of fresh, organic vegetables. And happy dispositions.  Yep. the experience here is completely overrated.  The fact there are fun mis-matched chairs and unique tables can be sat in at any thrift store, just bring your own Circle-K coffee and you're almost close to an attempt to recreate the Lux experience.  So...go there instead.   And the bar? Well, despite it being awesomely stocked and super cool, you can get almost, if you pretend hard enough, the same experience in your local dive bar.  You know, the one that stinks and provides the singular experience of having your shoes stick to their floors.  You certainly will not experience that at Lux, and that would simply be a shame.  Robbery of a unique cultural experience. Similar to getting stuck in an over-the-border brothel.  And if you are a creative, or a thinker, or are otherwise of any intellectual capacity, you will find LUX a redundancy of conversational inspiration.  It will provide zero challenge for you to gaze upon. There is simply an overload of sensory happiness at Lux. It could quite certainly and seriously be dangerous to your health if you have a pacemaker or are otherwise easily over stimulated by goodness.    ...in all honesty, this venue is the perfect place to go and be alone with tons of happy people all around you.  Get there early and camp out for parking and seating. It's worth it.  Thank you, Lux staff. You guys rock.",

That's fine with me as long as I can have my velvet latte with, wait for it.... LATTE ART!!! As an Arizonan, I have never had a coffee place make me a latte with foam art until this place. Seeing it in movies and on tv has always made me crave it along with the cozy little coffee shops it's featured in. After finding Lux, I've tried a couple other shops that make my beloved designs. Terra Java is a close second, with Cartel being third, but Lux is number one. It has a good mix of people. Old, young, eccentric, run of the mill and yes, hipsters. But not as many as everyone states. It could be bigger and it gets packed. Music is often too loud and the food menu is something you have to hunt down, which I'll never understand. But the coffee is what makes this place. And it's open late which I absolutely love!",

This is a 94 point, golden beer with a two finger head poured in a clean Unibroue Tulip Glass. Belgian yeast front with a nice intermingling of spicy clove. An earthy, boozy tripel for sure. Superb bargain. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OgJ0KxwJcJ9R5bUK0ixCbg?userid=iXGoQVfBXU0CrwrRBWXozA#LWelYMjIOOAcCOM77H6Sxg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/OgJ0...</a>  Katie is workin her oven at Lux this afternoon. I ask her what is for dinner. She says \"do you like meatloaf?\" I think to myself of Michael Lee Aday, an American hard rock singer and actor that played the character Bob in Fight Club, a big man in search of a life, at a self-help group and turns up as one of Ed Nortons most trusted lieutenants.   And then Katie said \"mash potatoes, broccoli, cauliflower. $15.\" oooya the Katie Meatloaf Recipe sounds savory. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/OgJ0KxwJcJ9R5bUK0ixCbg?userid=iXGoQVfBXU0CrwrRBWXozA#50c3DaXVZspgo46rH1xsVg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/OgJ0...</a>  We sat at the 4\" x 12\" x 8' rough sawn pine timber. The coolest table, I believe, I have ever had a meal on.   Dinner was enough for the two us, and was a great recipe with lots of flavor. Just like Mama used to make.  To finish our meal, Katie cooked an apple bar pastry with cinnamon, ginger, and the surprise ingredient everyone loves, apple-wood bacon. Plus an after dinner luxury gin and tonic.  I'm not sure how well known this restaurant is for dinner, but there was a good crowd and we loved our stay.",

The location is very suttle and hidden so it is easy to miss which is kinda cool and part of the experience in my opinion. The interior is massive.. they have about 4 or 5 sections of rooms all connected and also a small outdoor area as well. One of the rooms has a giant projector playing movies or sports. There is a bar area as well where they serve up excellent and fresh cocktails.. the coffee is spectacular and they can serve up just about any type of latte/espresso drink and they also happen to cook up some very hearty and high quality food for fair prices (try their mac n cheese and you can't go wrong with all their other food as well). Their baked goods are heavenly as well. Everything is fresh baked and the food is cooked to order. Amazing ambiance, coffee, booze and food.. what more can I say? Give this place a try if you live in Phoenix or are just visiting. Sometimes they'll also have a low key DJ spinning some cool tracks too, but it's never too loud or obnoxious, so it works perfectly!",

Any other establishment would be suffering from a major identity crisis if they tried to simultaneously function as a coffee shop, bakery, restaurant, and bar but Lux somehow does it all and does it right! If you are someone who likes working at a table with strangers (as most tables or couches will be full by the time you get there), loud music and the temptation to drink booze rather than coffee, Lux is the place for you!!  I love showing my friends from out of town this place in hopes they will fall in love with Lux, quit their jobs, leave their families and move into Phoenix!  Personally, I am nowheres cool enough to hangout here on a regular basis. The DJ plays his music too loud, I can never find an open table, and I always fall a fool to the temptation of to sipping down the nectar of me people, Templeton Rye. Iowa Represent!! But even with all that up against me, I still stop by at the Lux very so often to remind me how much of a basic b*tch I actually am. LOVE THIS PLACE!",

They do call your name when your order is ready but they  make no effort to find you (there are several rooms) if you don't hear your name called. This morning even though I was hovering close to the kitchen my eggs were cold.  When I asked they to please re-do the order I got pushback from the staff !

Then I fell in love with a coffee shop called Crossroads Bookstore and Coffee on Olive Ave and 83rd ave. This place is still my favorite though. But I don't live nearby so I don't really get to go as often as I used to when I had the time freedom. I've also never been much of a fan of Dutch bros. I tried them a couple times. But then I worked for a new and uprising company who became their competitor called Desert Eagle on 51st Ave and Bell Road. Their set up is just like Dutch bros. Menu and the way there is two drive thrus and a walk up. But I like the coffee better. To me it's roasted better. The owner himself roasts it in the back of the building just about every day if not every other day. But I don't go there for personal reasons. So I've never been here a couple times. I've only had one specific drink and the Mac n cheese. But let me tell you, the Mac n cheese is the best Mac n cheese you'll find on earth! You can get it plain or with bacon and jalapenos or just one of those items. And the drink I got, it's either the red velvet or just the velvet. And I like my drinks iced so I get that as an iced latte. It's not too sweet but not too bland. There's 2 annoying things about this place though. It's ALWAYS packed and the parking lot is ALWAYS full. Sometimes you'll get lucky and drive through the parking lot hoping someone is leaving and then you'll get their spot. Otherwise you have to find parking near by on the streets. Oh and there is inside seating too. But that even gets full too. My friend and I had a hard time finding seating. But that's okay. I want to try other drinks too. And they also have other pastries.",

Because that what I found. College hipsters that wanted to sit in their loneliness, but at the same time being seen - because whats more important than being seen right? If you just wanted to be alone, you could go to a dive bar.. but today's ideals thrives on attention.   It is almost that if there was a coffee shop/laboratory where you could enjoy your beverage alone but in public display.. I am not even sure where I am going with this. It is sad though that people rather text than interact on person.  The coffee bar has interesting elaborate concoctions with more or less actual coffee in them. You can have your coffee with milk, flavors and/or soda. That's how it is, and I had myself some nice big flavory cup of something that was sweet and caffeine laced. I would come back here, even if I do not understand the hype. here comes those who wants to experience the act of breaking the mainstream, but joining another mainstream movements that is almost as big as the original mainstream - but with even more rules and expectations. Complete culture fail - but you can bear witness of the unedgy alternative neophytes with their beginner beards and nervous lackadaisical doe eyes.  Again coffee was nice. I like coffee. I hate mock cultures that is nothing but a fashion statement. I also am very skeptical against mixing coffee with root beer. That's just wicked and gnarly. But as its stated before, they have something for everybody and they realize that coffee is also for evenings and not just for the early pick-me-up. Kudos Lux.",

Like literally a coffee shop WITH a full bar. Ample seating/ lounge space, unique and comfortable decor, welcoming staff and quick service.   Yes, Lux appears to be a trendy haven for hipsters and pretentious d-bags...but that couldn't be further from the truth. The crowd is a mixed bag of students, working professionals, old yogis and kids. (All of which I saw within my 10 minute visit). The only negative part of my experience was leaving to go back to work.   Most important: The coffee is good and refills are free.",

I just moved to Arizona from Chicago and needed a happy place. This is it and I hope to meet lots of friends and new people there and I get used to living here. Such amazing and kind staff and yummy yummy yummy coffee (the iced teas are great too!).",

It does take 10 minutes to get it, but if you see the work they put into it, it's worth the wait.   You know what's not worth the wait? Apparently me. I know they are all earthy n sh*t. Stacking their carrots n sh*t. I hate the word \"hipster\"; I hate the categorization of any persons. Perhaps that makes me a \"hipster\". Well, this hipster was waiting at the bar for 15 minutes to even be talked to. When I finally spoke up to the woman stocking the carrots, she just gave me a \"whatever\" look. I didn't get one word out of one person there.   I'm at home, eating McDonald's now. I haven't been there in over 10 years. I called them to tell them about my experience but no one answered. Not a big surprise. I left a message \"F*ck You!\"   Perhaps I ain't the classiest of honkies, but from Honolulu to Paris, Spain, Germany and Britain; this is my one and only bad review. Check my scorecard. I depend on Yelp in my travels. I never give bad reviews; especially since I had good experiences here. But this outweighs it all. The bad service previously kicks into your mind and you finally say \"F*ck it\", I'm not begging them to take my money anymore.  I've got a MacBook too btw. I keep it home and use my phone like a normal MF. This restaurant and whole clientele can implode into its own asshole for all I care.   Keep stacking carrots.   Peace,  BTW, that was me on your answering machine if you put down the carrots to check your messages.   F*ck you, Not your friend, Ty",

Slow moving pastry lady's work station is the end of customer picnic table, produce/eggs stacked along walls on your way to bathrooms. We liked our food but our experience ruined when we asked snotty counter girl if could get our egg sandwich cooked over easy. She immediately copped a huge attitude & acted as though we were asking for free food. Obviously this gal shouldn't be working in customer service. Just a simple request, we thought, ruined a nice meal. Lots of swearing going on between the staff right in front of looks like some sort of manager, drinking coffee & getting in the way of staff members behind the counter.  Maybe this place just a little too hip for this non-hipster customer.",

If you get anxious in crowded spaces stay away because you can't turn around without bumping into someone. Having said that, they do a great job of keeping the atmosphere very chill. They even had  a freakin DJ In there spinning coffee house music! The pastries are great but every time I found something that looked good it said \"vegan\" or \"gluten free\" so you have limited options if your one of the few people left who still appreciate butter and flour. The espresso is fabulous, but I honestly could not find a drink menu anywhere so I wussed out and just got a latte. I'm not sure if that's a hipster move- I know they don't like signs on the front of their buildings so maybe they're moving on to not having menus either??? It's also very tough to find so set aside some time to circle the block. But in the end I give this place 5 stars for killer coffee, awesome atmosphere, and succeeding at being three concepts in one.",

I've been coming here off and on for the last several years, and wow Lux has really evolved into more than just a coffee shop as it features lots of food for lunch and dinner, a bar serving drinks, wine and beer, not to mention their popular homemade baked sweets cutely presented behind glass panels while you wait in line. Now thinking back, I'm sure these were always available -- I've only just noticed now when I'm not bleary-eyed with lost sleep. Whoops!  The various coffees are really tasty if a little pricey (this is coming from a Starbucks-or-Dutch-Bros two-party loyalist here, haha) yet given the casual student atmosphere and the friendly staff who craft your drink really fast, you're hard-pressed not to pay the extra money and even leave a tip. Highly recommend everyone in Greater Phoenix to come see this gem of a restaurant!",

    "text": "Lux is hands down my favorite coffee shop in Phoenix. It's usually pretty busy, so be prepared to wait in line.  I always get a vanilla latte. I wish the Arizona weather would allow me to drink the hot version all year long! It's also good iced, but there's nothing like that beautiful mug of hot coffee. You can always opt for a dab of their homemade whipped cream if you're feeling crazy.  The food here is also great. I've had pastries, breakfast sandwiches and the best mac n cheese ever. I just wish the mac n cheese was available on the weekends!  Lux is the perfect place to meet up with friends or grab a spot in the corner and get some work done",

You should also be prepared to wait, regardless of the day or time I've been here it's always packed! There's always people studying, relaxing and or hanging out.   The space is very cool, and open. The vibe is definitely very hipster and a bit pretentious, and a bit un-welcoming. The few times I've been here I've not received the best customer service. This seems like a common complaint unfortunately..  Otherwise, they have delicious pastries and desserts. We had them catered at work and they were amazing! I just wish they had more gluten free/dairy free options. They also have some breakfast and lunch options and a bar.   Lux is definitely worth checking out!",

They have good options for those who like sugary decadent creations, and the taste of their coffee speaks for itself.   The service is always smiling and quick. Rarely is there anything wrong with the quality and if there is they are quick to fix it.   The atmosphere is fun and perfect for a coffee shop. If you like finding hidden nooks for reading or sitting with a group of people you don't know they have places for both!  They also have a bar if you are looking for a different kind of experience .",

The lines are long but they're super efficient and drinks come out super fast (food other than pastries takes a little longer). Honestly, I love all of their coffee beverages. Even just the plain straight black coffee (which typically isn't my thing)... so it's sort of saying something. I've also tried to iced latte (whipped cream is amazing here, I think it's a cold brew infused whip) but haven't tried the velvets or mochas because chocolate just isn't my thing (but hear they're amazing)!  They also have fresh-squeezed juices which I have a deep love for. I haven't tried their lunch or dinner but frequent around breakfast time to get some work done here and there.   Food wise: all of the menu Items I've tried are awesome, with the aunt Gladys breakfast being my favorite. The pastries I love. I've tried the cookies and muffins. I honestly prefer the standard muffin over the corn muffin, but both are great options. Really I haven't found anything you can go wrong with here!",

You'll always leave wanting more!  I don't think I've ever had a bad experience while at Lux. The bartenders genuinely care about the cocktail they are crafting as well as the experience. If your tastebuds are off, no worries, they'll concoct something fresh for you. Look for Sammy or Josh. They truly care about customer experiences. Mint Julep, Moscow Mules and Old Fashions will do tight by your side.   If you're hungry you must grab: Breakfast -Farmers Market scramble with a toasted and buttered toast. Sooooo savory.  Dinner -Mac n Cheese DO NOT forget to add Jalapenos!!! You'll cry if you do.  -Grilled Cheese with all the fixings (minus chicken and bacon for me - but do you boo) and add a side of tomato soup. I promise you'll thank me.  -If you're a meat eater grab that chicken risotto.  Desert -Chocolate chip cookies! -Lemon bar, if you're into tart tangy treats that makes your mouth water and cheeks clench. This is the one for you. I seriously can't resist it!!! -Chocolate Espresso cake. Light and very flavorful.   A few notes: -Seating is a bit sparse for such a trendy spot  -It gets loud quickly -Soccer fanatics are frequenters -Music is fantastic get ready to Shazam all night   Be prepared to have a great time!",

Their very uncomfortable chairs, dim lighting, and loud atmosphere makes this place a terrible study/work cafe. Their pastries are not covered- saw flies enjoy all the scones, quiches, and croissants before their customers. Their service is subpar. Came during non peak hours and still was rushed during my order. I had a rude female cashier that took the next customers order and payment while I was still in the middle of my transaction. When I asked if I could have my receipt she didn't hide that she was annoyed and told me I had to wait until she finished with the other customer (again the guy who was behind me in line). I asked the cashier to have my quiche Loraine warmed, but still received it cold. Overpriced coffee and quiche (total $13)  Come here if you enjoy mid/lower back pain, being treated poorly by rude baristas, drinking bland coffee, and wasting your money.",

From a standard cup of joe, to iced sugar brown water, to the soul-less slag that fuels the internet, to the beverages that are just Instagram accessories, to coffee-nerdness, you gotsta have tasty brew! Lux has it, in all the forms, a plethora of options for both the faint, chill, and intense of heart. There is a whole wall of coffee stuff that is just there to make your Mr Coffee feel inadequate  - seats - give me a place to sit, coffee shops! They have many. Couch seats, bar seats, table seats, inside seats, outside seats, plastic seats, bench seats, community table seats, cheap seats, nook seats, fancy seats, all kinds of seats.  - snacks - I might legit need a quick bite, or a meal, or a guilty splurge, and oh goodie all those are here! I had a lovely breakfast one time, bacon, hash browns and eggs with salsa, but my go-to is the pastry prison behind the surprisingly immaculate, counter-to-ceiling glass sneeze guard - plates of delectable and beautiful gluten-packed products that have been wrongfully accused and are behind bars, so to speak - set those suckers free! (actually they are just being transferred to my tumtum, justice does not previal, the pastry world is a dark place, whaah-whah*)  - bustle - I will make this mean whatever I want it to mean, but essentially, this is the quality that the coffeeshop seems a bit chaotic, but in a neighborhood sort of way. Like, it's clean, but based on the action it doesn't seem like it should be, it's crowded, but not in a noisy way, it's decorated, but the industrial  parts can't help but stick through. You gotta have peppy and droney style music, and stacks of boxed paper goods in a walkway are a 'must-have.' Lux has em.  Plus, there's wifi and outlets, and a parking lot out back and more on the street. Lux, you are my #1 spot for a hangout until the flight lands when I drive in from North PHX Metro to get peeps from Sky Harbor - a big upgrade from the deplorable cell phone lot!   *trombone sound",

So obviously my  order was incorrect and meant for someone else and I pointed it out and instead of an \"I'm sorry let me fix that\" I got a huge eye roll and an \"Are you sure?\" I showed the person my receipt and she said \"Oh fine\" and took the stuff away and I waited 30 minutes. Yes 30 before I was even spoken to again.   It's almost as if the popularity has gone to their heads. In their pursuit to be a little different they have alienated yet another customer which is quite unfortunate because they have a great product.

Not too sweet, not too dry. A great complement to a cup of coffee.   Aunt Gladys' house made salsa over four strips tender belly bacon three scrambled eggs white cheddar and hash $14: The name of the dish describes exactly what it is, and could use some punctuation on the menu. Unfortunately, they had run out of the salsa by noon the Sunday we visited. Still, the bacon was good and the right amount of crispiness. The eggs had the right amount of cheese, and the hash browns were nice and crispy as well. I would get this again, and hope that next time I get to try the salsa!   Final thoughts: Cute spot for coffee and pastries. Savory dish didn't disappoint either, so would love to come back and try more!  *****  My Star Ratings:  1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry.  2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return.  3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to.  4 Stars - Yummy!

The coffee and delicious treats are amazing.  Lots of tables to do table stuff. Lots of modern hipster chairs to do modern hipster stuff on. Outside seating is also available for those nature lovers. The art on the walls makes me wish I collected art.   It's an all around good time...so go!",

There's a lot going on so difficult to see that. From the street, it's not easy to know where the front door is. I would definitely come back but with expectation to pay a lot.

The coffee drinks are fantastic and it may have to do with the fact that they roast their own beans.  The pastries are also great, and they are baked fresh in the mornings. They have comfortable chairs to lounge on and read a good book. They also have tables that can seat up to 8 people, so it is a nice place to meet up with a group of friends. There is also seating outside under a shaded area.   There is a morning rush, but the staff is quick and there are parking spaces to the north of the building and also to the south.

I've known it to be a coffee bar, but word on the street was that it's a bar by night... maybe I live a sheltered life, I'm not sure.  We walked in through the giant glass doors and my first impression was \"hipster central.\" I don't consider that a bad thing, after all who doesn't like nicely dress hipster dudes? As we made our way through it was hard to decide what we were supposed to do. There isn't much seating and it was a little confusing where we were supposed to go to get a drink. But sure enough we were able to figure it out with the help of the bartender that we knew. I am not sure what we would have done without a little help.   Beside the confusing seating arrangement, the specialty drinks are a little high-priced, but delicious none-the-less. The setting is a little more intimate, so I'd recommend Lux for a quite date night. As for a menu, they have some drinks written on the glass-board, but I usually just ask the bartender to surprise me.",

So Lux is hard to spot, although it is conveniently located on Central and Indian School, right near a light rail stop.  Great coffee though and worth the hunt!  Walking in I found pretty much what I'd expect from a local coffee shop: trendy, laid back atmosphere, lots of comfy looking chairs, which were unfortunately all taken.  I did not however, expect it to be packed at 9:30 at night, half an hour before closing.  I ordered a latte; it was smooth and rich.  I would have mistaken it for a breve (made with half and half instead of milk) but I watched the barista make it and I'm sure it was done correctly.  I love a good breve but stopped drinking them because of the outrageous fat content.  Is it possible I've found a regular latte that tastes like a breve?  I'll be back tonight just to be sure!

The coffee drinks that I have tried have all been fantastic, but most of all I LOVE their whipped cream.   My one complaint about this simple, yet wonderful establishment is the parking lot.

    "text": "I pretty much have no clue why anyone could give LUX anything but a 4 or a 5 star review. I guess we could just chalk them up to someone who must have been having an all around bad day that day, I forgive them.   LUX is awesome because it's not your run of the mill coffee shop, with everyone behind the counter talking in half crazy coffee tongue that no one understand, yelling across the building \"JOHN!!!\" \"EMILY!!!!\", and all look like a corporate machine in their matchy matchy green aprons.   The first thing you notice when you walk in is the amazing smell, they roast their own coffee right there in the shop and it fills the air with sweetest smell, Love it! Yes, some people have a problem with \"all the furniture\" inside. But seriously, if you cant handle being close to other people, maybe interacting beyond your laptop, and possibly meeting some cool people then no, this place isn't for you. Go ahead and take your butt to Starbucks where you can not be bothered, and you are calling me snobby and pretentious? B**** please, get over yourself!   The winter is my favorite time to frequent LUX! Beyond their amazing caramel latte (with the cutest little foam designs on top) they have some of the best pastries and yummy treats. Last year they had the best cranbarry-barry crumble thing, I about died and went to heaven, so good!   They also feature artist from the valley on their walls. It's kind of like a gallery at times, because you can buy the art too. There are some pretty interesting things up at times.   LUX is great! You must check it out. If there is a long line don't let it scare you, unlike some other coffee places (caugh-Starbucks-caugh), they move with a quickness and you never have to wait to long.",

I've graduated college already but I like to come here and pretend like I'm doing something important while I sip on some coffee, check my Facebook account, check how many cool votes I got on Yelp and check the movie times using their free wi-fi.   The place gets packed on the weekend so be prepared to have to scope the room out for an empty spot at the table or wait for someone to finish. I never usually have to wait very long.  The staff here is super helpful. If you don't see something on the menu, just let them know what you normally drink and they can make it for you. The selection of treats are amazing. Cherry oatmeal bars, snickerdoodles and diner cake. If the coffee doesn't get you wired, the sugar might.   Its fairly quiet and has some music on but I usually just bring earplugs so I can secretly listen to Britney Spears. No one has to know about that. The guys who frequent this place are pretty cute, except their usually gay. Oh well... a girl can dream, can't she?!",

Sure, there is a child's softdrink named after another gentleman with \"Roy\" in his name, but if I had ordered a Manhattan I surely hope they wouldn't pour me a Beam and Coke.  Before they attempt complicated cocktails with St Germain, Aperol, muddled strawberry and rose water, they should learn the classics.  For coffee, they get 4 stars.",

Freshly roasted beans, baristas who know what they're doing, (AND look like they're having a good time doing it), an outdoor shaded patio with funky wood tables and indoor seating with mismatched modern chairs, delicious baked goods (some guiltier than others), beautiful local artwork on the walls (a photography display today), and an actual DJ playing music for the lingerers' enjoyment! It goes without saying that the coffee is delicious.  Both times I went in, the guy at the counter offered advice on my choices (the scone he suggested was indeed delicious, not overly sweet, but perfectly buttery), and no one pressured me to get through the line, as often happens at other places where people have their order down pat. I also enjoyed the company of other Lux patrons both times I went, and savored my coffee outside on the patio with a good book.",

The food is also amazing, BUT, it's also high dollar. I'm not one to eat where I can't afford, but, some of the items are up in the $20.00 range, and when you lack an ideal ambiance and adequate seating...it's not a fair price in my eyes. Don't get me wrong, the food is great, but, if you have sit sandwiched between a college coed marinated in Curve, and an group of Lana Del Ray wannabe's belting out the lyrics to whatever indie song they recognize...it's just a bit hard to swallow knowing that you paid a hefty price for an atmosphere that just does not deliver on the personal eating space factor. Bottom line, I think this place is great to grab a pretty good cappuccino, solo or with just one other person. If your from the PNW like myself, it's...well, it's still not Portlandia.",

Amazing home-baked tasty little goodies -- something different every day!  Usually with vegan alternatives, and at least one reasonably healthy choice, including fresh fruit.  Just had their no-bake chocolate-peanut butter-oatmeal cookies -- which were seriously yum!  Still my favorite is the ciabatta-style toasted bread with real butter and Nutella alongside one of their perfect soy lattes...- heaven!

On my way to get my new blow dryer I slipped in a puddle of shampoo, I've been walking on crutches for the past 41 years, and never have I slipped or fallen in a store, I am a leg amputee.  Today I received a phone call from Walmart (CMI) telling me that they found no negligence on Walmarts behalf.  So I guess that all the pain I'm in and all the X-rays and MRI's I've had are my responsibility.  I've missed 19 days of going to the gym lying in bed sore and in pain.  At first I thought I broke the top of my arm, which I immediately had x-rayed, and thank God it wasn't broken.  And I had a scrape across my back which was 9-10 inches long,  and my hip and knee hurt.  Till this day I can't get comfortable with my leg on the bed.  Who are they to say that Walmart wasn't negligent for what happened to me.  I can't even get my out of pocket expenses taken care of.",

I enjoyed a \"Black\" Manhattan which was made with Rye Whiskey. It was perfect! Of the menu items I was able to sample the macaroni and cheese was very impressive. Completely unique and light, where most mac and cheeses are clumpy, heavy and boring.  The staff is delightful!  I can't wait to come back to Phoenix and get my LUX on!!",

Their hodgepodge of furniture - Midcentury rejects line the walls and old backlight tables - complement the easy, laidback vibe of the place. Of course, the Mac crowd wouldn't have it any other way.  I haven't ever had a cup of coffee in my life but they always have juice, Vitaminwater and other non-coffee alternatives to choose from. Plus they have a few treats, like brownies, to snack on. This place is MRB approved!!!",

While studying in the, what seems to be their quiet room, there was music playing at a fairly low level that was different from what was playing out in the main areas. The sound level of the music playing wasn't the problem, but the words being used by the artist were. One of the artists songs repeatedly used the 'N word'. Lux MUST be more responsible about what they play at their establishment. I am truly hoping that it was a one time mistake.",

There are so many kinds of people who come here, but everyone, from the employees to the customers, is very friendly. My cousin and I got a peanut butter brownie (amazing) and got up for a coffee refill a couple hours later, and almost the entire pastry case was different. They're always baking their pastries fresh, but if you have something specific in mind, it may not be there when you arrive because they're always rotating. That's okay, try something else, you won't be let down! The food quality is great, so I don't mind paying a bit extra for it. The ideal student's/worker's cafe - there are rooms that have a tendency to be quiet for those who need them. What more could you ask for in a coffee shop?",

    "text": "Every time I'm in the area I always stop by Lux for a latte. Somehow Lux manages to imbue their espresso shots with a roasted marshmallow flavor that's unique and awesome. Sometimes a good latte from Cartel Coffee Lab will have a similar flavor, but I haven't encountered it anywhere else, including from 3rd wave coffee mecca Intelligentsia in LA. The lattes are the main reason I go to Lux; I've sampled some of the baked goods behind the glass display case, and the pies and quiches are quite good but I wouldn't make a special stop just for them.  I suppose the place is kind of hipster, but I've always found the staff to be very friendly and welcoming when I roll up in my very non-hipster khakis-and-oxford working clothes. Much more welcoming than Press Coffee and Cartel, for sure. Espresso pulls from Lux are also much, much more consistent than either Press or Cartel. A little rearranging of the ordering and pickup area would be welcome - coffees are delivered to the same spot where you order, which leads to traffic jams. But drinks come out relatively quickly so it's not really a big deal.  There is a lot of seating, but the place is always so hopping that you never know if you'll get a good spot to hang out or not. Worst case, there's a lot of communal tables where you can squeeze in.   Bottom-line, go if you're a coffee freak seeking the perfect latte like myself. Their lattes absolutely give nothing away to avowed 3rd wave places like Intelligentsia or many others that I've tried. Kick back and enjoy the vibe and pretend you're in downtown SF or Berkeley while sipping the best lattes in town.",

The clientele here make for highly entertaining people watching. At ten in the morning, there was the guy who never took his shades off, inside. His buddy next to him looked like a hired goon from a 1960s era James Bond, with slacks, a dark long sleeve button up shirt and a pony tail. Then in walked Phoenix's Russell Brand equivalent. Clearly either on molly or in a manic phase, homey was just LOVING life. Everyone in his path got a high five or a hug and a smile, with his dreads flopping this way and that. At some point he walked behind the counter like he owned the place, because apparently the baristas needed hugs and high fives too. Then his girlfriend walks in, a beautiful girl covered head to toe in body art. They eventually walk over to Shades and Igor and he introduces her to them. Her name is Goddess. I half expected her to begin an incantation, but apparently she wasn't so moved.  Not everyone in Lux is as awesome as these people, there are a fair share of people who didn't look like they throw their enemies into pools filled with sharks or have bipolar disorder. Boring people like me. Fortunately there will be enough characters who could have walked out of a B-movie that you shouldn't get bored. Suffice to say that you will likely be entertained.  The food was very good as well, and the coffee was perfect. The scene here is so rad though that those come as an asterisk.  No great if you: are looking for a Starbucks equivalent Great if you: need a high five and a hug",

But when you enter into the dimly lit coffee bar and everyone has their macs up... you wonder if you stepped into a warp hole.  All that aside, they have a good selection of coffees and teas. Hubby got a double shot espresso latte .... with a pretty leaf of latte art! Hubby thought it had a less sharp taste than the double shot we got in New York... but I thought it was just fine and dandy. Really enjoyed it.   I also got a small vanilla cupcake w/ espresso frosting. I liked the frosting...really tasted like whipped espresso but the cake was wanting.   We settled into a sofa seat ...and I took a small nap while he surfed the net with their free wi-fi. There's seating outside with wooden chairs as well.

The only reason I went there was that it was the closest to my home.  They have horrible customer service and awful attitude toward their customers. They always insist that you make an appointment if you want to talk to someone other than a teller. They make it very difficult to make an appointment by posting someone near the door. Once you get the appointment, you get an email reminder, as if to say, you better be there on time!  They gave me an appointment for this morning (it was the only one available so I couldn't schedule an earlier time) but they did not keep it. The woman near the door kept telling me we are \"a little late today; please wait\". I waited for 40 minutes and complained a couple of times. She apologized but she didn't do anything about it other than saying \"we are a little late today\".   They had just one person working there, and whoever had the appointment before me was taking forever. She didn't want to disturb them, and she didn't think my time was valuable.  They should never schedule appointments that they cannot keep in a reasonable time. I didn't mind waiting for 15-20 minutes past my appointed time, but when that turned into 40 minutes with no end in sight (I had another appointment at 11 am elsewhere, so I had no choice but to leave at that point, since it didn't look like the only person working there would be done in the next 5-10 minutes), I told that woman in no uncertain words that I would not keep my money in their bank.    I have waited shorter times in doctors' offices. I am very unhappy with Bank of America. Why should I put my money in a bank that does not value my time? It is best to transfer my money to another bank. I know at least one that offers good customer service. In the past I was able to walk into the facility and get immediate attention, without an appointment, and good service too.",

    "text": "I eat out once a week, and when I do, I bring more meals home with me to eat at a later time,  I'm a widower, and cooking for one is no fun!   I ate there last night, and for me, it was a Jekyll & Hyde experience for me.  I ate there four weeks ago and it was a wonderful experience.  I had Emily as a server, I asked for a couple of substitutions on the three meals I ordered and she was very accommodating and very friendly.  She even, without my asking, gave me quite a bit of their wonderful pizza bread to bring.  The bread is a real treat.  Last night, however, Emily wasn't working and my server was an older fellow who paid very little attention to me.  I constantly needed to ask for refills on my Iced Tea.  Unlike Emily who was always watching my table and at least three times during my meal, she asked if everything was OK.  No such luck last night.  To top everything off, one of the substitutions I requested was for meat sauce instead of marinara sauce on the ravioli dish I took home.  The server said OK and I thought it was.  But, when my bill came, I was charged $3.50 for a side of Bolognese sauce.  When I asked what that was for, the server told me that meat sauce was more expensive than marinara and that was what the charge was for.  I was floored - Emily didn't do that I said.  But he insisted.  I told him, that if there was an upcharge he should have told me up front.  I left an angry man, and my tip reflected that  When I got home, while putting away my two extra meals, they felt lighter to me.  I opened the containers, and sure enough the portions were about  the size they were on my first visit.  I am really confused about the difference.  But Vivala Emely!!!!!!!",

You won't find a more diverse mix of interesting people on a weeknight.   My Lux ritual helped me make friends, learn about PHX & break out of my shell.   Also: the lattes and baked goods are bomb diggity awesome. And though you wouldn't necessarily expect to get great eats at a coffee house, dinner is AMAZING too.

    "text": "At long last, my first visit to Lux.  Located right across the street from Central High (my alma mater).  I'm not a coffee drinker, but was intrigued by the food and the atmosphere.  Not much for me to add to the numerous reviews about this place, but its pretty much as advertised.  Good food, quirky setup, crazy busy.  Its a coffee house first and foremost, but they also have a wine and cocktail bar.  Its a bakery that serves breakfast, but also has a lunch and dinner menu that changes regularly.  Sort of reminds me a little of La Grande Orange Grocery in that it has multiple personalities depending on the time of day.  Sometimes places that try to do everything well often don't do anything well.  But like LGO, this place is an exception.  I came here on a Saturday morning around 7am.  My timing was perfect as the crowds started streaming in shortly thereafter.  Parking can be a chore as there's maybe 15 spaces in their main lot, so be prepared to park along Turney Ave (which also happens to be overflow parking for the apartment complex next door).  You walk up towards the front counter and get teased by a smorgasbord of tantalizing pastries and can also order off the menu on the wall.  The sweet dutch pancake with fruit intrigued me so I grabbed that.  Also got sides of their bacon and hash, since those also seemed to be feature breakfast items.  Along with an OJ, total price for breakfast with tax came to about $18.  You order up front and pay, then seat yourself and wait for the kitchen to call out your name.  I can see how this could be troublesome when its busy.  While there's plenty of seating in back, the front area can get crowded and noisy really fast making it difficult to hear your order called out or navigate the throngs of patrons.  Fortunately, no such trouble for me this morning as I got my food within 10 minutes of ordering.  Sat down at the bar area up front (which is full stocked by the way).  The food was pretty solid.  The veggie hash was mostly potato, but you could pick up the carrots and other veggies mixed in.  The bacon was fantastic.  I'm not sure where they source it from, but the bacon strips were thick cut and the taste was nothing like your store brand bacon.  As for the pancake, mixed feelings on this.  A great assortment of fruit and they put on plenty of whipped cream on top.  The pancake itself was good, but honestly tasted like an afterthought.  It was super thin almost like a taco bowl and fell apart pretty easily when I cut into it.  Didn't hinder the taste at all, but the presentation was such that it was just sort of there.  Still, a tasty breakfast that left me full and satisfied.  I'll be back at some point for a lunch or dinner go round.  And next time I probably won't be able to resist those pastries.  Overall, I can see why this place is so popular with the CenPho crowd.  You'll see suits, students, and joggers alike in this place.  I can't speak to the coffee, but obviously Yelpers are pretty high on that here.  I would imagine the Brophy/Xavier/Central High students probably frequent this place regularly.  And yes I'm a little bummed this place wasn't around when I was a student across the street.",

This place is the epitome of a \"hipster\" hangout, and many people seem to hang out here to \"be seen\". Their drinks are good, the environment is good for relaxing/doing some light work, and the pastries are delicious - they also seem to have different ones to choose from every day, and everything is baked fresh in-house. There are multiple rooms to sit in, but seating can still be tough and you might be hard pressed to find anything during the busier times (especially on the weekend). The crowd here also definitely skews younger, and most of the employees too. Overall, I'd highly recommend it if you seek an atmosphere similar to what I've described.",

I've attempted to come here twice before, but tables were packed out and I needed to cram for an exam, not chat with some random guy at my table about philosophy.  The third time, I had no studying to do and therefore got to experience some of the \"culture\" of the location.  That's how I learned that I've been trying to come to Lux for the wrong reason - you don't come here to study, you come here to look and be seen.  You might do some light studying while also achieving the before-stated goals, but it's not your primary reason for visiting Lux.  Lux feels more like a bar than a coffee shop, which might be explained by the fact that they seem to have a full-service alcohol bar as well as their caffeine menu.  Patrons will likely randomly strike up a conversation with you.  They may or may not be on ecstasy when they do.  This place is hipster-center, with baristas who are working frantically to keep up with the large and growing line, and with crowds of people taking up most available seating at peak hours while writing books on typewriters.   That said, the coffee is good, and they look like they have a wide range of food options.  I had a chai and sampled a few other drinks.  The coffee was definitely was better than most coffee chains.  I understand the appeal - if hipsters are your crowd, you'll love this place.  For me, I much prefer a small, intimate coffeeshop where you're automatically greeted with a smile and where you can bury yourself in a textbook for hours on end.",

    "text": "I try to go to Lux as often as possible but I still have mixed feelings about it.   The cappuccino is wonderful; one of my favorites! I can't say that enough! I recommend making a trip to try one if you haven't! The food is always tasty and unique. If you can find a good place to sit I would try ordering one of the items on their menu, really fantastic! All of the pastries I have tried have been delicious also! I am telling you, you need to go!  The only reason Lux gets a 4 instead of 5 is because of the atmosphere. When I go its hit or miss, most of the time I get the impression they are way too hipster - bordering pretentious - to care about your experience. The following are just a couple examples:  I wanted to try a drink at their full bar one night, so I asked one of the employee's behind the bar what he had in his hand and he responded with \"ice\". Yes, there was a piece of ice held in a pair of tongs in one hand, but he also had a cocktail in the other hand... Following his response, he walked away from me and never returned to ask if I had any interest in ordering a drink or to give me any clue about what he'd been making. Most restaurants and employee's attempt to make you feel involved and entice you to purchase something, but no such luck. Unfortunately that experience was followed by another unpleasant one at the bar on a different night, so I haven't felt inclined to drink there again.   I had another recent experience with lux when I ordered a quiche from the front. We waited 10 minutes for them to heat it up but it was never called. So we checked and they said \"oh, it must still be in the oven\".. Although, didn't bother checking on the item or why this was taking so long to heat (since its already cooked). After another 10 minutes we checked with the front again and she finally went to check and said, \"Oh, I guess its been in the oven the whole time\". Needless to say it was overdone. The staff didn't apologize or offer a replacement, sadly this didn't impress my friend who hadn't been to Lux.  I still say you should go, the food and espresso are amazing. I just wish they would come back down to earth a little bit.",

I'm not a huge coffee drinker, but I'd find an excuse to come back here soon.  The atmosphere of the place is pretty laid back in a hipster kind of way.

The people at lux take coffee very seriously, almost to a science, looking at the applied,focused and meticulous moves of the barista. The result is an amazing espresso, thick and oily, an explosion of coffee flavors and zero bitterness....  For those who enjoy, lux looks and feel almost like a 1960's hippie communal cantina except that most the patrons there are deeply absorbed in gazing at their laptops and ipads, facebooking and interacting in cyberspace, certainly not talking to one another. You will find here a hipster ambience, very stylish, very friendly and quite comfortable, as well.  On my last visit there 2 days ago, I was greeted by a charming barrista, but cashed in by a very abrupt, borderline rude young plump woman.... This killed the whole experience for me.... No matter how great the coffee is, the least she could have done is say please and thank you, especially at nearly 8 bucks for an espresso and a medium latte.  Oh well.....The coffee there is still unbelievable, especially if you combine it with the Dutch pancake and the homemade whipped cream.",

I've searched for 'my place' in every city I've lived and visited!  Again, this is it.  It succeeds not only as a coffee house, but also succeeds as a breakfast, lunch, dinner and drinks place as well.  Think \"Friends\" watering hole!  It's big because it stitches together several rooms.  Each has a different personality that serve different purposes...study/reading quietly, TV room; then others for talking with another person, and others for meeting with a group of people.      Great, great bacon mac & cheese, lemonade, iced coffee...it's what I tried today.   Great selection of pastry...which I didn't try!  People are friendly.

Not the cleanest, but they were busy, so I understand. Coffee was ok; too much syrup in my latte. Breakfast sandwich was not good.

Finding this place can be a bit tasking for first-timers as it is easy to miss. When you do find the place, parking just adds on more stress. The place itself is always exceptionally busy, so expect a wait time to order. The good thing is they stay on top of things so it's not too bad.   The cool parts: They serve alcohol. Food is fresh. Did I mention they serve alcohol? Also they are open till 2a for all those NIGHT RIDERS!!! (I am the Night Rider!!)   The off putting parts: The place is busy which means finding a table can be impossible at times (including the back area). My biggest critique goes to their music. Their \"background music\" is obnoxiously loud. It feels like you're at a club and that is disappointing for a place like this. I go here to enjoy good food, coffee, and even conversation. Turning it a bit down is all I ask. This may be just a personal quibble, but that's what I feel bothers me the most.  Overall this is a fantastic place, and you haven't lived unless you've came here for breakfast!! :)",

The service is fast, quick, and easy. The coffee...strong and sssmmoottthhh. This place is cozy and laid back. Radiohead was playing in the background. I had their veggie egg bake which was delicious though I wish they gave me more bread! It was so good. Brought home peanut butter cookies for my boyfriend and those were devoured right away. The atmosphere is great, decor is unique and has a slight hipster feel. They serve wine also which I found to be interesting. And the employees were friendly. Try this place out. I could really go for some of that coffee right about now. The baked goods in the window all looked decadent and they have a lot of vegan and vegetarian options.   (tried a bite of a vegan doughnut that my friend had.....did not like. I guess I like my butter and eggs deep fried in oil. It was just not the same.)",

They don't seem understaffed, but the charming, friendly and attractive children who work there are SOOOOO easily distracted, forgetful and just plain slow when the place gets busy.

If you are looking for a spot to study or relax and people watch..this is the spot.  Otherwise, bring headphones, you'll still enjoy it minus the noise. :) Enjoy!

Before move I received quotes from several moving companies but Poindexter gave mw the best quote. Poindexter was referred to me by Uncle Bob's (Scottsdale) where my furniture was stored. They came to my house to assess the scope of work and gave me a quote with a 'not to exceed' clause. Not only they were the best price wise they did a great job with both moves. They dismantled everything and wrapped them in protected quilts. They hired a staff of six energetic men and two trucks to do the move. Fast but careful they accomplished the job in a very short time. They also followed with me after the move and came down to fix a few items that could not be done at the time of move. I have not claimed any damage from the move.   I would strongly recommend Poindexter - why try some one else and pay more money when you can get the best deal for less.",

It wasn't too busy although there was a very steady stream of people in and out. I had a small, non-fat sugar free vanilla latte ($4) and picked up a homemade, oatmeal creme sandwich for $3.   Pluses: I love the msmatched, kind-of random decor that makes you feel very comfortable. Free WiFi, and a wide variety of baked goods. I can ALWAYS be sold on baked goods. This might be a weird plus, but I was totally loving their ice water with fresh oranges inside. I am probably the only person that never had this before, but who cares, I loved it. Totally refreshing on a hot AZ night.   Neutral: The employees weren't exactly friendly but weren't rude, either...just kind of indifferent. Hmmm, correct that, they were very friendly with the regulars but I sort-of felt unwelcome at first but I quickly got over that.   Negatives: The music is too loud. Maybe that was intentional towards the end of the night but I was having an extremely difficult time focusing on what I was studying. Don't get me wrong, I loved the music but it was a bit much. Okay, alot much.   Bottom line, this is still a great little local coffee shop and I might be stopping here instead of Lola next time...",

There is enough space where I can find a cozy corner, turn on my work laptop, drink coffee, have the 2 egg breakfast with tomato and veggie hash (I opt for the tomatoes instead of bacon. AND. I love bacon, so i think that's saying something about how stinkin' good those tomatoes are).... Where was I? Oh yes, have my work computer on... so Office Communicator is running... ;) ... and I can enjoy breakfast (which frequently turns into brunch) and read the paper, a magazine, a book, make travel plans, etc.   LOVE it.   Also for you futbol fans (that's soccer to you english speaking folks), they will happily play your Barcelona should-be champions, on the big screen in the back room- all you gotta do is ask.   ***Speakeasy bar area. The mixologist takes some serious time and consideration for each adult beverage I've ever had there or seen him make.

I haven't been to Lux in about 1.5 years and since then it has moved into the building next to the old one, tripled in size and is the most delicious, eclectic coffee experience I could ask for. Looking for fresh hand roasted coffee on site, check! Fresh made unique pastries, check! Fresh, gourmet-like food, check! Handmade from fresh (and I mean FRESH squeezed juice) mimosas, check! I can go on....I could not ask for a better place to be a part of my life. Thank you heaven for waiting for me to find you.",

I tried a cheddar jalapeno muffin which was a nice blend of sweet and savory. The coffee on the other hand was underwhelming. I got a whiteout cappuccino and my wife got a vanilla latte. Upon tasting the espresso in both drinks, I could taste an unpleasant bitterness which I describe as chemical or turpentine. This usually means the beans were improperly roasted. I also think the microfoam on the cappuccino could have been prepared better as it was more bubbly than a good cappuccino normally has.   I could have visited on an off day as I know I have had good beans from here before. Off days happen sometimes.",

Lux is the kind of place middle aged women go to pretend they are hip, the place where you won't find any seating unless you come at an odd hour, and most of all the place where I find myself pretending to study but end up just being amazed at people who are actually studying.  Best coffee in town, considering the size of the kitchen and that they do all their baking and cooking in here, the size of the menu and the outcomes of every dish that I've had in the last 4 years are astonishing, from pastries to quiche, mac and cheese to steak dinners this place can make whatever you're craving with honors. Also probably the most hipster bar I've ever seen, but boy do they do it right. Wonderful cocktails and decent beer and wine selection.   To some it's a magical place, to others it's a over-hyped coffee shop. Either ways this place has established itself and definitely deserves a try.",

Located opposite Central High, and a bit tricky to get to, but worth the effort.  My dear daughter and I would meet for coffee a few times a month, closer to home, but NOW, we meet more often and drive further just to enjoy the ambiance and perfectly brewed Joe! We usually arrive soon after they open, which we've learned, beats the morning rush between 7:15 and 7:45.  The morning goodies, from what I gather, are made fresh on site and worth sampling every muffin, cake, scone or pastry! Its hard to decide what to order, unless the cranberry orange muffins are available. Not a big frappe or latte drinker, so I get the dark roast house brew in a to-go cup, so when we leave, it's easier getting our refill on the run out the door...don't be shy, just belly up to the front o the line and the great staff will take care of ya!  And remember their tip, they deserve it!  We sit way in the back, past the restrooms, where it's a bit more conducive to conversation and very comfy couches. A great place to study, or get a bit of work done, too...free Wi-Fi. This is our hang out for Father Daughter time, thanks, Cheryl B., and LUX!!.",

She was very patient and answered all our questions (which we tried to keep short due to the line).  Now, the place itself is super eclectic and there is art and decor to look at no matter where you sit on the inside.  The porch was packed, so we weren't able to enjoy the nice day outside, but the inside isn't a bad backup at all.  We got to sit next to Marilyn Monroe on a pink couch that was comfy and the wood slate table is something I would put in my house in a heartbeat.  Our orders: me - a mocha with a crumb cake, his - vanilla latte with lemon cake.  We didn't realize until we were out of the line that they served full breakfast plates!  That'll happen next time for sure.  The coffees tasted great and the crumb cake was delicious.    Overall: A Fun and artsy with good coffee and pastries galore...yes, please!",

    "text": "Lux is one of those coffee shops in Phoenix that as a coffee lover, you must try once, because whether you like it or not, this is a beehive for people and ideas. Aside from boasting solid roasts, a large baked goods selection, and a full bar, its central location and late hours makes this 'the spot' for hipsters, millennials, freelancers, and students alike. If you like to people watch and engage in random conversation amidst laptop work, or come hang out with your friends, this is the place. I've been approached to be a hair model (not creepy, awesome), gotten recommendations on books, found and returned a wallet, and gotten my laptop work done, all while sitting down by pink Starship Trooper paintings on the wall. Bring your headphones if you want to tune the chaos out, but if you'd rather do that, you should probably go to another coffee shop instead.",

Yes, the parking is tough (although I found that to be the case with a lot of popular Phoenix places) and the entrance is a little confusing (the door is next to the sandwich shop door, although it's worthing peaking in there too because the decor is kitschy and adorable). Lux was an extremely well-curated and eclectic experience. There is really cool lighting, mismatched couches, and an older guy behind the giant mod leather couch mixing some beats. I was so enamored that I walked right by the ordering counter, although the service was very friendly when I did figure it out.   I waited barely three minutes for my iced vanilla latte, served in a mason jar (obviously). After scanning the area and considering the table with typewriter center pieces, I plopped on the couch and set my drink on the tree stump table to watch the woman behind the long wooden bar zest pieces of fruit from giant bowls. I was very tired from my early flight, but the whole thing was surreal and dreamy. I didn't get food, although the baked goods looked delicious. Upon trying to find a restroom, I realized that there are multiple rooms to this beautiful place, each with their own style of furniture and artwork. There is even a patio if that's your thing! I had to run to work, so I didn't get to stay and people-watch, but there were plenty of people there- I could see it getting too crowded to be comfy!",

The art on the walls is always interesting. I think it's a little yucky that some of the furniture is so beat up looking in such a pretty place though.   I've had dessert and coffee here. Both very tasty. The service is pretty good as well.  My one thing is that it always seems to be so busy. And by all means, that's great for them. But I'm always seem to be in someone's way when I'm by the counter waiting for my coffee. And so many people have settled in to be there a long time with their laptops and stuff, and that just makes the space seem a bit cramped.   All in all though, Lux is worth checking out.",

This place did not disappoint. My latte macchiato was delicious. The coffee was perfectly balanced by the milk; all-in-all, a great drink.   Good atmosphere and friendly baristas, too. I appreciated the kind suggestions from the girl at the counter. Will definitely return the next time I'm in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Okay, so I admit it. Sometimes I get a stubborn idea about not wanting to go to a specific establishment due to a fierce loyalty to one of it's competitors. It took me a while to cave on this one. Too long in fact.  Everyone loves Lux and as it happens, they have good reason to! My latte was supremely delicious. The environment is great albeit slightly confusing as far as the flow of service.   I absolutely love the patio area. This place definitely has a Pacific Northwest vibe that immediately resonates with me. The service was really laid back, yet authentically friendly. I was far too busy enthusiastically catching up with a dear friend to take in all that Lux has to offer. There's room in my heart for Lux after all so I shall return. My primary concerns going in were the coffee, service and atmosphere. A+ for all in my humble estimation.   I was a little late to the party, but I had a blast anyway.",

There are a bunch of little nooks in the place, some very public and some perfect to hide and do work. The had a big projector screen hung up playing some sort of sports game but I hear they also do themed nights, which I would love to go back to. Awesome vanilla soy latte. And they have food too! Their menu changes every day I think, but if you follow their Facebook they post it! They serve alcohol here too, which is cool, and stay open late! Give it a try next time you're in Phoenix.",

It's my home away from home--I don't know where I would spend my weekend mornings (which always end up turning into the evening!) w/o lux!  And I used to HATE bloody marys!!!!! Bacon as a garnish?? Pure genius. You get nothing but the best from Lux EVERY time. Everyone I take there is blown away. It's just a pure gem.",

The new location is much roomier, has more seating, and most importantly more table space! I find this to be a great place to study, meet someone or just relax.  If anyone tells you this isn't a hipster bar, frankly, they're lying. However, I find this rather refreshing compared to the rest of Phoenix which can be quite hum drum. And not every patron is a hipster, however hipsters dominate.  The coffee and pastries are excellent and the staff is friendly and personable. They now have two separate counter areas in the new location, one that serves the coffee and pastries and another that serves the booze and food. Also they are now open until midnight, but only serve coffee until ten... which is excellent in my opinion ^.^  Overall, I love Lux and am happy to have them as neighbors! Wonderful place for me to study (especially with extended hours now) and they are certainly helping with my SF withdrawals, being new to Phoenix and such.  Two areas for improvement though... there is NO HAPPY HOUR :'( and their coffee could be MUCH stronger.",

There was what appeared to be a menu on a clear glass wall but it was hard to read and only had a few things on there. Luckily i have my regular orders that i know by heart.   I really miss the intimate feeling of the original building. Although I'm happy they had to expand for a growing clientele a part of me wishes they kept the coffee shop a coffee shop and had the food/bar in the new building.   I've also been here twice since the new building, both on a Sunday afternoon and it was so packed! The first Sunday i was able to find a spot to do work, but today i was unable to and just had to turn out the door after doing a lap around and seeing no seats at a table open. I never had that happen in the previous building... Perhaps when the weather is cooler this will improve.",

The line is out the door and the process is awkward like you need to be in the know to know what is going on because no one tells you! This is where the hate part come from. My husband will not come here with me because of how crowded it is. But the velvet calls my name and I will reluctantlly be back.",

It was a Saturday night, about 10 pm and my boyfriend and I went dressed up (NY standard, not PHX standards) like we usually are to go out and needless to say the minute we stepped foot inside I felt a little out of place. But we forged through the coffee area to the back bar area. We found two cozy seats and were greeted. I have to say although I look very different then anyone working there and most people going there they were all very nice to us and helpful (which I cannot say of all \"hipster joints\" *cough* Cartel *Cough*).  If you like a great cocktail and even to challenge your palate, You HAVE to go hear! They have all quality liquors and mixers and to make it even better, there is NO cocktail menu. They can make all the classics, but the fun part is telling them what you like and don't like in a drink and they will create fabulous concoction just for you! I am talking rose water, lavender, all kinds of herbs and unique flavor profiles and combinations. To make it better, the prices are reasonable! To get a fabulous hand-made cocktail with all top shelf and beyond liquors for $8-$10 is a great deal and  they don't use ice and \"fillers\" to cut you short, with a couple drinks you will feel, let's say, relaxed... Now the Mac-n-cheese with Bacon and Jalapenos!!! YES! It is perfect. Great comfort food, you may feel guilty for having consumed all that fat BUT it is totally worth it and you will love every moment of it! Their baked goods and coffee are also great. The music however... I have been there when they played the whole collection of Metallica (Lord, help me)... It isn't always that awful, however I don't care for the music most restaurants play today, so I digress.  I have already brought a few people and suggested it to a few others.... this is a must try! I tell you what, hipsters know their cocktails, coffee and food.",

What can be said about Lux, that hasn't already been said in its previous 1198 reviews (how about that I'm jealous my review doesn't get to be number 1200!?) The interior is inviting, and the exterior has a lovely view. Their music is pleasant (and can be found on Spotify). The staff are as sweet as the pastries. Seriously, the bakers, the baristas, the chefs, & the bartenders are all so hospitable and personable, and remember your name if you're a regular.  But of course, the Jewel of the Royal-Crown-Masterpiece that is Lux Cafe, is its food & drinks. Review their customer-submitted photos of their coffee and tea. They have a full bar. Yeah! A bar! And they're drinks are fantastic!  And ooooh, but the food though! The Food Though! They're breakfast egg, bacon, & hash dishes! They're pastries! They're salads! They're sandwiches! ... And they're infamous Mac & Cheese with bacon & jalapeno!  just go right now and treat yourself! You'll fall in love with your newly found home away from home; Lux Cafe!",

Hot or iced, either way is very delicious. It's never empty that's for sure but why wouldn't it be since it's a very chill spot. I've been back many times since and happily introduced at least 7 of my friends to this place!

We will NEVER go back so long as the same snooty, shit face, rude, unwelcoming staff is still there.",

I don't know if I\"m hip, but I do know sometimes I get thirsty. For some java. And thirsty for a non Starbucks place to hang. I think the loud DJ music kicks ass. What a great stamp to put on the ever so tiring hip coffee house scene still sprouting up across this great land. Funky art? Seen it. Eclectic rec room furniture. Sat on it. Tattooed and face- bejeweled employees? A must have. But the DJ? That's all Lux baby. My doctor has \"suggested\" (ok, like he totally insists) that a go easy on the caffeine. So one cup of this sturdy liquid beans keeps me going all day. Muffins and scones are great, especially if you get there real early. The Lux crew is friendly and efficient. It's so popular that navigating the small quarters at peak hours can be dicey. I know I've bumped a few end tables in my quest to get out and hear the slosh of a patron's coffee spilleth over. But, you know. Since I'm so hip, I just keep walking.",

If you go often enough, the other regulars will be friendly. If you hate Mac laptops, you probably should stay away. The new tables are great. There are power outlets everywhere. It's next to Pane Bianco. I run into my homies there on the regular. When it comes to coffee shops in CenPho, there is no competitor. Jeff, the owner, is a cool dude. The seating outside is nice. I have been known to spend all day there, and use it as my office away from home and my real office. I seriously probably spend about 16 hours a week there or so, maybe more some weeks, working on my laptop and occasionally people watching. Did I mention that I kind of like this place?",

My favorites are the brioche slices with jam and the honey bran muffins....and the mexican wedding cookies.....and the lemon bars. Service is always quite friendly and fast. They have just plain cool people working here. This place runs smoothly.  So then why just 3 stars A-oK? I'm totally on LUX's side! Good service, tasty coffee and nice bites....but here's why:  The computer people. There are faaaar too many computer folk at this place taking up waaayyy too much room. And they're not considerate enough to just go home after three hours. Now, before anybody has a coronary - just know that I'm aware that computers are a part of our everyday lives now (I guess) and people don't have to be confined at home to study blah blah blah but COME ON. This is a social atmosphere - designed to chat and laugh and make new friends and have coffee. If you're ordering one cup of tea and stretching it out over several hours while taking a seat that somebody with a pulse and some social skills could be occupying - that's just rude.  This place needs to 86 the free Wi-Fi and let people pay for limited times of web access. Period. LUX used to be more of a social atmosphere, but they've caved into the laptop \"nesters\" and set no guidelines whatsoever. So most days you walk in, and the only sound is the music, because nobody is talking. Instead there are over-serious, glossy-eyed lumps of what used to be humans doing their research papers for college or googling themselves or updating their facebook status every three minutes because they're bored and nobody wants to talk to them. And staring you down as you come in like you're invading THEIR space.  Nesters....go HOME. If you can't study without being in this environment from dusk til dawn, maybe you're not that interested in what your'e studying - which might mean your'e in the wrong major. Or your concentration just sucks ass. You can't have your brioche and eat it, too.     Your 1 Computer + Your 8 Binders + 3 Huge Biology Books x  How little you actually study ---------------------------------------- = You're annoying and you need a home office.  other than that, I like going here, but get your frickin' powercord outta' my mocha!!",

Unfortunately, at such time we didnt have any other alternative but Starbucks, until Lola's Coffee opened and welcomed us with open arms. Glad to say I have never looked back.  But putting their demeanor aside, their coffee isnt the best for the exorbitant prices you pay.",

Too bad we all left with the same comment - The young girl taking our order was down right rude.  She was unfriendly in an almost condescending way.  I might go here again to sample some of the food but if I have a similar experience - i won't go back.  There are plenty of other places uptown where the service is friendly and appreciative.",

Guess it depends on how their day is going. Still was in 3 times today #shameless",

So, I ordered the salad with olive oil and vinegar dressing minus the ham, the server told me it would be made vegan for me. After half way through my salad, I found a piece of ham on the bottom. Oh man I was bummed. But, I didn't make a big deal because you know what, mistakes happen and it's nobody's fault. The server asked me if I wanted a togo box but I said no because the piece of ham turned me off from wanting to take it home. He was so apologetic but I told him I understood because us humans are allowed to make mistakes, right? Accidents happen and thats okay. I got my card out to pay and he brought me the bill... for ZERO dollars. WOW!! I couldn't believe it. Usually it's always the people that bit_h that get free stuff and I thought it was so awesome they took care of my salad for me. I am beyond impressed, such wonderful customer service.",

It can be a little confusing going in for the first time because you can either order from the line near the entrance or you can go over and sit at the bar area and order there. If you choose to sit at the bar be sure to ask for Luke. I don't know much about this tall handsome work of art but I can tell you he makes THE BEST drinks in the area. Just tell him what type of drinks you typically like and he will whip something tasty up for you. Don't expect it to be quick though... remember... there is an art to getting the best drinks in Phoenix. Be patient and you will be pleasantly surprised!!

First off they have the best tasting coffee, from cappuccinos to dirty chai's, they're all delicious. The layout and atmosphere of this place is very eclectic and an awesome vibe. From the different art, music, to styles of furniture like stained wood slabs for coffee tables, massive wood bench in center, and mood lighting, just overall has a great atmosphere. When you walk up to the register there is a massive assortment of pastries that blows your mind (if you're on a diet it'll be broken). They also have the best cocktails, there's no drink menu but they make it fresh on the spot, and best of all...they're STRONG! Not to mention flavorful. It's not overkill by any means but if you want a drink for your money ($8-10 on average) then Lux is the place. The staff there is very friendly and proactive, good to even chat with at the bar. Food menu is high quality and frequently changes, I've had chicken salad croissant sandwich, berry tart pancakes, a chicken cous cos dish with a large english muffin. Very different and overall great taste I'm very picky when it comes to my food. So overall this is my favorite place in all of Phoenix so far for vibe, drinks/food, coffee, hangout, all in one...",

    "text": "So this place isn't all that bad, most of their workers are very nice and accommodating but this is the second time I've had a bad experience here and tonight was definitely not okay. I went to buy an apple around 1030 ish pm and the girl at the register with long hair up in a ponytail, striped tee and nose piercing on the barista side was very condescending and when I asked her what my total was because I didn't hear her the first time, the tone she took was sarcastic and drawn out. I decided not to push it and instead go elsewhere but when my friend who was next in line wanted to purchase something, she took the same rude and condescending tone therefore my friend asked, \"Is there a problem here\" the worker answered, \"we can make it a problem.\" First of all why? Second of all she didn't have to be so rude and forthcoming, it really did feel like she was trying to instigate something (I don't know what or why). Lastly, as someone who has worked in the service industry for years and never has written a bad yelp review I felt this was necessary. She also continued to be rude with comments like, \"yeah, just go elsewhere,\" etc. I definitely understand she might be having a bad night or maybe she is just rude but it was definitely uncalled for and uncomfortable for everyone there and not just myself. I hope there is a follow up to this review if the if the owners care about the service that is being displayed when they're not there. PS: her name is Sonia",

    "text": "Welcome to the most overwhelming place in the valley haha! So, this is about my fourth time at Lux and I thought what a perfect time for a review while sipping on a hot Lux Chai! Starting with the Chai, it for sure is not the best I've ever had as halfway through it gets decently water-y but the foam and the first few sips were great! This place is definitely hipster and has a lot to offer. They have a coffee bar with pastries, coffee and tea (I've heard the B&W is great but have yet to try it! Although, I have had the Iced Caramel Latte which wasn't the best..they're passion fruit iced tea was pretty decent, especially with unlimited refills while staying on the premises!) They also have a full-service open kitchen with all three meals and a wine bar! The atmosphere is wonderful, as their is so much seating in such an oddly shaped space! I have yet to try their food/pastries thoe! I keep seeing reviews with issues on parking but I've never had an issue with such! Now, granted, the maybe 15 spot parking lot is ALWAYS full, but the side street that Lux is located on is very easy to find parking on as their is always a space with possibly a very short walk. I would recommend this space to anyone looking for a good meal (as I've heard they're breakfast is great), a place to study, meet friends or have a drink!  Please check out my collection: \"The Valley's Best Coffee Shops + Houses,\" on my profile; featuring Lux Central and other amazing Coffee Shops in Phoenix!",

My friend and I went after class for coffee and breakfast, so we ordered two caramel macchiatos and two cinnamon rolls.   When we ordered our drinks, which every other coffee place in the history of coffee knows how to make, the barista rudely informed us that it wasn't on the menu and they don't make it like that. If I wanted attitude, I would've gone to Starbucks.   After the coffee debacle, we asked to have our cinnamon rolls warmed up. And OH MY GOD! You would've thought that we were asking her to climb Mount Everest! The barista threw the BIGGEST FIT I HAVE EVER SEEN IN MY LIFE.   Long story short, I'm still trying to find the cinnamon for the cinnamon roll and get the burned coffee taste over my mouth.   **Currently en route to Dutch Bros.**",

Their coffees are beautiful, as they add an artful touch to the beverages with cream or milk added. I opted for cold brew with 2 Espresso shots and was not disappointed!! So yummy!

It's now 2:25 and I'm greeted said tender will be with me. I say great. 2:30 I get a water and a menu. 2:40 I order the most amazing Mac and cheese that everyone comes for and a cocktail. Cocktail comes ten min later food twenty min later. It's 3:47 I'm still at the bar I left my card on the table to check out ages ago.  You know let someone else take the car seat. Drink empty ready to go. I'm looking at the bar tender here and there but not even any other staff notices I've been waiting. Food is amazing.  Drink is amazing. It will still feel like you don't matter Here it's almost 4 pm and I'm sitting here to see if the staff can read my body language or eyes. I could speak up but it's not busy yes I have time.

Here is the skinny, it is the coolest coffee shop I have ever been to, so I would say that Lux is an excellent experience!  It was almost a week ago that my friend Jess took me to Lux and I am still geeking out over it.   I loved my coffee, my berry cornmeal muffin, the chocolate chip cookie (with salt on top) that my neighbor let me try, the drink selection, the ambiance, the DJ in the corner playing the cool music, etc. etc.  Groovy things about Lux--  You will love it the minute you walk in. I don't believe in love at first sight... but love at first entrance to Lux?  It happened.  They roast amazing coffees. So a good old- fashioned cup of coffee tastes Delicious. How much is that big beautiful cafe going to cost you?  $2. Are there free refills?  YES!  That is off the rocker cool!!  I have a local favorite coffee shop in Tucson and are my refills free?  Nope. The selection of quality coffee drinks and breakfast treats is still on my mind.  I also am thrilled that they offer soy milk, almond milk and organic milk.  Almond milk is my milk of choice. I wish every coffee shop had almond milk.  I'm so over soy.  So if I was to have an iced chai at Lux, I could pay an extra .50 and have my almond milk. Next time I am at Lux, which will be on my next Phoenix trip... I am having one of those iced mochas that I saw so many peeps drinking.  They put a dollop of cream in the mochas... I can't wait to have my own!  Cannot get over how rad Lux is!",

Yes, death to checking account by LUX. My next novel...  The service is always super and the interior is absolutely beautiful. I like beautiful things. I've taken many photos here over our visits (4 times in less than 2 weeks) and posted them via my blog and anywhere else I can show off my delicious brunching events.  Even when they are super slammed busy on a sat or sun morning they have a routine down to where your wait in line is never awful, we somehow always find somewhere to sit (even with a party of four), and the food/drink is out super quick.   That being said, just because the food is delivered quickly doesn't mean its sub-par. It's ANYTHING but that. Every time my man and I go we order the Veggie Egg  Bake, which is different every weekend, and the steel cut oatmeal. The Veggie Egg Bake is the perfect savory meal to accompany our sweet oatmeal! I seriously have dreams about our trips there. We always order iced soy lattes and add a fun touch with a colorful straw.  You need to go here.",

    "text": "I would give Lux 5 stars if it wasn't for my most recent experience. Don't get me wrong I love this place- from the food to the coffee to the ambience.   However, for my birthday we ordered one of their awesome cakes since it's my favorite. Called and spoke with one of their pastry people she gave me her cell telling me it was the best way to place the order. So we placed the order about 5 days in advance she said everything was good to go. I gave my name, order, and pick up time (1pm), seemed easy enough. Well, my birthday arrived and we went to pick up said cake- well you guessed it, it wasn't ready. The man working the counter looked at me like i was crazy while he went to inquire about my order. We can see him and the girl i'm assuming who took my order, looking around and starting to rifle through things and go through her phone! After waiting an additional 45 min (when i was told they just had to pull it out of the fridge) and watching them slap it together, mind you the man on the counter was the one who actually put the frosting on, not the pastry person, I finally received my cake. No \"thanks for your patience\" or \"sorry about the wait\" or for forgetting my order completely.  So, sadly this is why I cannot give Lux the 5 stars I wish I could. I have been here many times and am a loyal customer and frequent, this experience just left a bad taste in my mouth.  Enjoy their treats, coffee, and food,  but maybe be wary of placing a special order even if they assure you it will be made.",

    "text": "I went to high school in the semi-neighborhood in the late 90s (damn, when did I get old?), and if my memory serves me correctly, Lux was actually open then. It was very hip, actually too hip for me, as I found the servers and the atmosphere very cold and unwelcoming...maybe even mean. Well, a lot of time passed, Lux changed buildings I think, and I was hearing great things about it from Claire F, who still lives in Phoenix. So ~12 years later, I gave it another try, and this time, it totally wowed me.   It's still hip. Like super hip. But this time, everyone is friendly enough to make you feel really welcome. The furniture and decor are really eclectic and thrift-store cool. The crowd is pretty varied - on a Saturday night there were a few people too young to sit at the bar, mostly 25-35s, and a few 50+ sitting eating or reading or working on their laptops.  My favorite part of Lux is that it has a little section devoted to everything: a to-go counter for the bakery items; a more 'restaurant-y' area with bigger tables for ordering off the full dinner menu which varies nightly; a bar area where you can sit at the bar and converse with the bartenders or at smaller cocktail tables; a back room where you can watch a movie or chat; and a quiet room which has no music so you can utilize the free wifi.  We didn't eat dinner, but the menu looked interesting - the special that night was some kind of steak with veggies. We did have desserts (awesome, especially the salted chocolate chip cookie) and drinks (excellent beer list, and 'collaborative' cocktails. Seriously, you just talk to the bartender about what you like).  To top it all off, the walls are filled with the work of local artists, they have a big patio on Central (near the light rail!) and it's located next to Pane Bianco.  If you think you're not cool enough to hang out here, you're not. But they won't hold it against you.",

I try to avoid this place; however, when I'm meeting a friend who lives in the area it seems like the most viable option.  The line to get coffee is ridiculous and there is no sense of order whatsoever in the place.  People kind of stand around behind the cash register waiting for their name to be called to get their coffee.  As far as seating is concerned, good luck finding a place to sit down comfortably.  If you find a seat, keep it, don't get up to pee, because someone will take it.  Lux to me is more of a pick-up joint and not a coffee bar.  Everyone in this joint has a MacBook or MacBook Pro or iPad or iPhone.  Everyone here so desperately tries to be different and unique, but when you walk into the room, all you see are black-rimmed glasses and MacBooks staring at you.  Hipsters trying so desperately to be different, yet they all look the same.  Listen, I really like the overpriced coffee here, it's delicious, but everything else about the place is annoying.  Oh yah, parking also sucks, good luck with that too.",

We actually brought our baby (as I said, just aged-out, so new baby must come along on vacations) and it was super chill. While there was no sitting inside, the outside was a lovely Phoenix evening with a lovely crowd of folks.   We tried out pastries and coffee drinks. The pastries--Red Velvet Cake and Lemon Bar--I wanted to love because they came on adorable mismatching china, but at that late hour they had unfortunately staled.   But the coffee! I had a decaf Americano and it was maybe the best coffee I've ever had. And to be honest, decaf is never good. It's just something to sip on whole others have a cocktail. This decaf, though...  My husband waited in the epic cocktail line (separate from the food/coffee drink line) and asked the bartender to surprise him with something coffee-based. He was served some kind of masterpiece of spirits and freshly-pulled espresso, complete with thoughtful aromatic garnishes. Again, rocking coffee.",

    "text": "I heard this is a recruiting station for those homely American Apparel models. I heard they charge a cover if you don't bring a Mac.  All clientele jokes aside, this really is a place where an average Joe like myself can grab, well, an above-average cup of Joe. And more. This place has some apparently good eats, baked goods (some of which are vegan!), amazing teas, and a groovy beer selection.  I opted for an \"Earl Greyer\", because good black tea owns. This stuff was dank! The barista took the tiny pouch out of a can, and I could smell the bergamot from pretty far away. \"Let it steep\" he said, giving me about five minutes to scour Lux for this review. Here are some observations:  -I have excellent vision, but the menus printed on two windows were admittedly a pain to read. Sure you don't want to have some in print?  -The area to order and the area to wait seemed to be the same place. There is no clear line, but more of an amorphous bunch of people eager for service.  -The layout appears to encourage openness. Too bad most people are too busy typing away to enjoy what could really be a bustling social scene. Come on, there's amazing goodies, great music (I swear I heard some Band of Horses), and a bar. Live it up a little people!  -While the cooks were having a great time, I don't think my barista cracked a smile at any point. You have a great job. Enjoy it!   Overall, I just have some minor beef with Lux's interior. A haphazard design that can easily confuse newcomers appears to be an avenue of pretentiousness rather than a chance to showcase aesthetics.   But I'll stop nitpicking, I like this place a lot. Can't wait to try more!",

    "text": "If your looking for a fabulous place to have some coffee, meet with friends, waste some time or grab a bite to eat, Lux is the place. This local coffee shop is better than any chain coffee place.  Walk into this place and you will know why.  The atmosphere is a place where you can grab a seat on a couch and relax and enjoy your coffee or meal.  This is a great place to bring a lap top and do some work or play. This is a place that you could visit any time of the day or night.  Reminds me of a little coffee shop in downtown Denver that I used to visit.   The coffee is delicious and they have delicious pastries if you like. The only reason I give this a four star is they don't offer a Thai iced tea. :(",

I miss them doing a rotating menu each night but I understand that must be difficult. The menu that they've adopted is a lot of what they offered before and still delicious. Everyone is super nice and always answers any questions you have about the menu. The always changing pastries are my favorite! We especially love the thumbprint cookies and oatmeal cream pies but everything we've had is amazing!",

I suppose I'm easy, but I am freakin' smitten with Lux; beautiful, interesting restaurant with tables full of pastries and derishous foodz pumping outta their neat little kitchen that's in plain sight.     Hipster-ish? God damn right, but I'm the furthest thing from hipster and I felt no less love while I was there.  Seems fat white doodz with their bohemian children in tow (bohemian = I let my kid get dressed in the dark) are just as welcome.  It's nice to be pleasantly surprised by an eatery;  Lot-o-hype seems to be circulating about Lux - possibly because a bunch of  ass-hats were overly pumped about a new 'hip eatery' (entrance is dependent on either a  handle-bar mustache or a 1/4 sleeve tattoo).  Not the case; this place is le-jit.   What did I eat? Biscuits and gravy.  Biscuits and mother-freaking, delicioso GRAVY.  Damn, it was fine.  Not the healthiest thing in the world, but my arteries can go fuck themselves.  Unfortunately, with my dish of choice being so filling, I was unable to perform my duties as 'daddy-disposal' - My child's unfinished portion of dutch pancakes, with fresh berries and what I'm assuming was homemade whipped cream was left for the hungry, more than likely neck tattoo'd kitchen staff.  Vultures.   Can't wait to get at Lux again.  Mmmmmm.",

I order the Chai Latte, to which the chai is made in store, and I feel as if I have completed the tri-force.  When I order a moscow mule, they are out of mint, and the mixologist says that he has been experimenting with cucumber and cinnamon blend that he highly recommends and all of a sudden I know kung-fu and I see 0's and 1's, I know that I have hit a special place.    Lux does what you want it to do.  They bake, cook, saute, brew, and mix everything this world has to offer and the next.  They have a wide assortment of beers, make killer desserts and they dinner menu is varied.  According to Ashley N. (2014), they make the best Mac and Chee which I must confess is mad suspect considering the Tuck Shop winter menu exists in this fair city.  Obey your thirst.  XOXO,  ~Mikey  P.S.

However, I am a creative type and really loved the atmosphere and crowd here. I sipped a carmel latte, which was good, but could have been hotter. I didn't eat anything, but the food looked and smelled incredible. My only little complaint was that the girl who rang up my coffee was lacking in the people skills arena. I mean, we get it, you're tatted up and you don't conform, but it's still a busines and I'm still a customer -- and I'm spending money. I would expect her to at least give the appearance that she likes working there. A smile or a little intro to this place would have been appreciated. I tipped her a buck too, which I would bet most of the hipsters don't do. That said, there are tons of seating options here, all arranged quite well. You can work independently, gather with friends to chat, meet with a client or even go on a date at Lux. You can also meet some really interesting people there if you hang out. Happy to have discovered this little gem of a place. I'll definitely return, and hopefully the grouchy chick will crack a smile this time.",

Mmmmmmm.   :-p  But seriously, Lux is a great place to go for that cup of \"coffee\" you're craving, but consider yourself warned as others have mentioned; Lux is almost ALWAYS busy, so seating and even waiting for your order can be rather inconvenient (think Grand Central Station busy on weekends)....    and for that my review would have been for 3.5 stars instead of 4.",

Fluid motions tap the doser, fill the portafilter just right, tamp and connect to the, from what I've heard, custom made hand-pump espresso machine, to make the most ethereal coffee experience.  This is not your average joe and you have to be ready for it.  I loved the mix of people sitting at the tables, hanging with their MacBooks and enjoying the morning.  Very eclectic group of people.  Great place to sit and people watch for sure.  Bought a pound of their custom roasted, organic coffee.  Was kind of annoyed I didn't say I wanted the espresso roast, but when got back home, boy was i in for a wonderful surprise.  Even their regular roast coffee is an experience.  I asked them to move to Salt Lake.  They said they would.  Can't wait!",

Lux serves iced beverages too, but let's face it: coffee is best served hot.  I sampled the ice mocha, per recommendation of a friend who's been frequenting the joint for some time.  Amazing!  I did feel a little crampy afterwards, but that could simply be because I don't usually drink dairy products.  The Rice Krispie treat was really tasty, but those are hard to screw up.  :)   The place was packed with some cool-looking people.  Everyone seems to keep to themselves as they work on their respective laptops.  In fact, some people even shared tables yet remained fixated on their own computers.  Really this place has a great vibe, and it made me feel like I was back in Europe.  I'd like to see soy or rice milk on the menu.  Otherwise, great coffee joint!",

The other half of the time the music is Jazz and very conducive to drinking coffee and talking and seemingly more appropriate for the environment. Every once in a while there will be a semi-friendly face at the register, but not very often, in fact it is rare- I once made the mistake of ordering a small drink and they snarled at me that they \"only pull double shots\" which I had read only moments earlier on the menu but had already forgotten (mommy brain) but they definitely could have handled that a little more nicely. They have books and other kid entertainment so I know they WANT to be kid friendly but the loud industrial music has got to go. The coffee is good and the environment is cool. The pastries are heavenly. I would have only given them 2 stars but the owners are pretty cool and I have hope that they will become more consistent with the music and service. I haven't been there in  a while, mainly for fear of a bad experience but I will give it another chance.

Seems a bit claustrophobic with so much furniture in there but perhaps it's due to the summer heat.  All in all a nice place to spend a sunday eve.  Thanks Lux!",

We were seated right  away and our waitress was attentive throughout the meal.  They have Kirin beer on tap!  The con's:  The food was not good.  I lived in Japan for ten years and I know Japanese food intimately.  My wife ordered a crispy skinned salmon salad (not really a Japanese dish) that was mostly crispy skin and very little salmon.  She says it tasted good, though.  I ordered yakiniku which was not only a very small portion of meat, the whole thing was drenched in sauce to the point that you could not taste the flavors of the ingredients.  The sauce was not even close to Japanese in flavor.  The prices are ridiculous for everything.  The menu is quite limited in terms of most of the things I would normally order, like sukiyaki, katsukare, shabu shabu, katsudon, etc.  Ginbon is far better and cheaper, albeit that when I ate there last they had some service issues.",

We have had breakfast in many cities, including such notable breakfast cities as Berkeley, New York, and our own Somerville, but this has to be the best breakfast place ever.  The woman at the front desk of our hotel recommended Lux the first morning and during our entire stay in Phoenix we never went anyplace else for breakfast.  For starters the place has a great blue-state vibe--definitely not what we expected to find in Arizona.  And then there's the food which was truly amazing, especially the veggie hash with eggs and terrific toast and (another morning) the best oatmeal I've ever had.   The coffee was superb as well.  We never did get there for dinner but we're thinking we may have to return to Phoenix just to have breakfast at Lux.",

I really love being in their space, and I love that after only three times, Danielle, who took my order, remembers my name, and knew the name of the guy behind me, too.  That sort of personal touch means a lot to me, and despite some of the pretense--like having a DJ on a Friday morning (spinning good tunes, I might add)--it's comfortable and fun.    I like that they serve my Moroccan Mint tea in a cast-iron tea kettle.  I like how they cook all the goodies right there in the same space as the customers, and I like that the people who work there match the style of the space.  Wish they did pour overs and pressed coffee, though.    Their mixed alcoholic drinks have all been excellent, although pricey.  My favorite is the slightly odd margarita they make, and it takes about five minutes to create, so be patient, but it's well worth the time.  Prepared food takes forever, especially if there's a line, so I suggest ordering a pastry behind the glass and a drip coffee if you are in a hurry, but then this isn't Starbucks, so don't come here if you need to rush off.",

There is plenty of seating inside and out front under the covered awning. This comes in handy during the summer months for getting out of the sun, but does that really matter when it's 117 degrees?

    "text": "Still love the coffee.   For the first time ever, I order my coffee and something sweet - for there. While in line, I eyed the sweets. I wasn't the only one, though. A little fly was having his fair share of sugar, flying from scone to muffin to cake. My heart dropped. Luckily, they had a few choices covered up in glass. I chose the massive, super-chocolate walnut brownie.   Somehow, miraculously, I managed to carry two plates to the \"coffee condiment station.\" I set the brownie down gingerly on the napkins. Then I balanced the coffee cup and saucer in my left hand.... while pouring cream slowly into the cup with my right. I made it almost to the door, when I decided to set the brownie plate down and sip the coffee below the rim - before it sloshed all over the place. It was a suspenseful, long walk and I didn't have a clue how I was going to turn the door handle and make it outside. I stepped aside and asked the people behind me to give me a hand. I don't think they heard me, but they held the door open long enough for me to slip outside... and into a wooden bench directly under the noon-hour sun. Wowza.   Since it's always so hard to find a spot inside, I opted for out. My brownie began to melt. The hot coffee tasted great, but it did little to save me from the heat and the sweat beginning to collect down my spine.   Needless to say, I tossed the coffee back like it was a cheap shot at a club, stuffed my brownie in the to-go bag I requested and practically jogged to my car, where I blasted the A/C and drove away.  Upside of all this? I sliced my brownie into small pieces and shared it with my co-workers, who have not yet been to Lux, although I keep telling them to go... Looks like I brought Lux to them.",

I've lived in the area for almost 2 years. how could I have missed this place?  Can't wait to try the regular menu.  One weird thing,  which has absolutely nothing to do with the cafe, is that it seemed almost every single person in the place has an Apple-brand laptop. It was kinda twilight-zoney. And the funny thing is my co-worker asked me the next day If I noticed that everyone had Apple Laptops. I DID! I DID!   :) Go and love it!  UPDATE - 10/20/13  OMG! I just have to update with one of the most amazing cakes I have ever had. It is a slice of Vanilla citrus cake with coconut filling. My tastebuds are doing the happy dance right now. Dee-freakin-licious, people! Earlier, I had the NY strip with couscous with carmelized onions and mushrooms and broccoli. I rarely crave red meat but for some reason I was today and Lux did NOT disappoint.   Also, I was getting hangry (hungry and angry) cause this guy in front of me was ordering like really slow and asking too many questions but this amazing, beautiful  lady with long dark hair and a warm smile, who i can only assume is the manager, calmed me with her amazing customer service and awesome chilean wine recommendation.

There was barely any seating but it was a nice place to go to and get quality coffee, I usually have to settle for Starbucks basically burnt half the time. At Lux, it's smooth and tasty. Not too sweet and not bitter. The staff is always so nice. Go try it once and you will be hooked.",

The staff explained that their usual machine was broken, so they were making coffee one cup at a time on a non-commercial machine. No discount on the coffee even (and it's not cheap)! I considered also the menu, but thought it was too pricy. The atmosphere, while professional, is very noisy. This is not the sort of place I'd meet someone for business meeting. As far as the quality of the coffee, it was ok, but if I wanted to go out of my way, I'd probably be better off going to Cartel.",

    "text": "OK, so I've only been here once, and only to shoot a short film in one of the many, many rooms inside the fun and interesting maze that is Lux.  I had some tea and a breakfast pastry of some kind, which were both great.  I wanted to try so much more, but we were on a shooting schedule (thanks for the space, BTW) and didn't want to look like a hog on-camera.  So it may be tricky finding parking, but you can easily take the light rail here too.  And it's worth it when you get inside.  We were there on a Saturday very early when just a few regulars and the staff milled about.  But as it started to fill up, I could sense the community that develops because of the atmosphere.  It reminded me of the coffee houses in the Pacific Northwest; like Seattle, a place I've never been but where I hear coffee was invented in 1991 by Captain Kirby Starbuck (I jest).    Anyway, it is both a place to sit alone and enjoy your breakfast/coffee on a comfy couch with a good to mediocre book, and a place where you go to meet people and talk because you're forced to by the people hogging the nice seats.  Also, you can wear your Matisyahu t-shirt here and people will get it (they may groan, but they get it).  So go to Lux to make some friends, level up on your hipster points, or just hide out because it's probably better than the Starbucks closer to you where all the unfriendly snowbirds hang out.  Oh, and it appears they're open and night too, serving alcohol, which is a bonus.",

They should probably see why I have been standing there so long. Bad customer service. Another thing is I was waiting in line and the barista started taking the order of the guy BEHIND me...he never checked to see if I even ordered.

    "text": "The thing about Lux, is that it's the kind of place you don't realize is amazing until you can't go there regularly anymore.   When I worked in Central Phoenix, Lux was my daily coffee place on the days I got my ass out of bed early enough to stop before work after driving down from the far Northwest Valley. I'd stand in line like a zombie, roll my eyes at all the try-hard hipster clientele crammed into Lux's old space and pray that my coffee would take less than 15 minutes to come out. It was a means to an end.  Then, I got a promotion that put me at work closer to home, in the suburban wasteland known as the West Valley, where the only options for a morning java are the Circle-K on the corner or one of the 50 Starbucks locations within a mile radius. (I'm a VIP gold card holder now. Yay for me. *blows kazoo*)  But occasionally, I do get downtown. A friend might want to meet up for dinner at Windsor or I might need to turn in some paperwork down at the state department, and every single time I'm near, I find myself drawn up Central Avenue toward my old morning haunt.  Now, when I go to Lux, I welcome the cool reception from the baristas. I relish in the fact that the people who come here know what they want and how to order it properly. I enjoy the moment I get to take my hot latte and my carefully bagged pastry and find a dilapidated couch to perch on, where I can listen fondly to the nearby hipsters talking about art, music and other pretentious things, because it's so SO much more interesting than listening to a gaggle of PTA moms discuss \"super cute\" Pinterest DIY projects to make with their children Braden, Jaydyn and Vadinn.  And let's face it, Lux does make the best latte in town. The temperature and the ratio of milk to syrup to espresso is always perfect and it always comes out with a lovely bit of art on top, even when the line is backed up out the door. The pastries taste fresh, because they are made with real ingredients and served fresh, not made in a factory and shipped frozen across the country to be defrosted the night before they are served.   Joke about the hipsters and the \"Great Aunt Susan's rent-controlled apartment in Bushwick\" look all you want, Lux is popular for a reason and they don't ride on image alone. The quality is in the food and drinks and they remain far ahead of the competition. You will never be bored here, I can promise you that.",

It is also a decent place to hang out with friends.  Plenty of seating with music in the back ground.  I would have to give 5 stars for this.    The food was ok to me.  My wife liked her quiche and that's where we compromised on the rating.  I thought the food had a decent taste but the portions were small for what the prices were.  I don't mind paying more for food as long as there is some knock your socks off flavor but that just didn't happen.    I had the biscuits and gravy with sausage.  It came with 1 biscuit and runny gravy with a little bit of sausage.  Just didn't cut it for me.  I even ordered a side of hash browns that were pretty skimpy too.    Good place to eat if you like to eat kid sized portions.",

My daughter lives within walking distance to it. So she is the one that had me go there first. Breakfast ,lunch, and dinner ,coffee and even the drink! I have to say my favorite is the Breakfast. Nice little place to go, I do not like it when it is packed and too many people here.   But, on off times it is better. Parking is limited. Very worth a try. I really love downtown Phoenix, even though it is much different than most major cities. They are growing and developing ever so slowly.",

    "text": "Oh my God... Where the heck did this hipster haven come from -- and in Phoenix of all places! Seriously, Polaroids on the wall, mason jar glasses and lots of bespectacled patrons.  I saw just how many Yelp reviews Lux had and had to lay my preconceived notions about people from Phoenix and their snobbish ways aside (I'm from Tucson, can you blame me? We're all a bunch of dirty hippies in Baja Arizona). I stopped in on a recent trip up to Phoenix and enjoyed a croissant and a latte.   I was immediately impressed with the vibe (wait, did I just use the word vibe... I think I did), even though I was a little surprised by it's location -- there's not much around it at all. Great music, great art and a laid back atmosphere that's conducive to just hanging out or perhaps writing the next great American novel.  The croissant was to die for, and the coffee was perfect -- apparently roasted on site.  I sat at the juice bar and watched an impressively mustached man create some very interesting drinks. I didn't stick around long, but I liked what I saw. I'll definitely be back next time I'm in town.  The only reason I didn't go ahead and give the full five stars was the initial frustration I had when ordering -- I'm no idiot, but the process wasn't intuitive and none of the staff seemed interested in helping me out. They were too busy updating their Instagram and talking about the next greatest band you've never heard of. That sort of bummed me out, but the yummy coffee soon made up for it.",

As a coffee shop, it does a lot of things right -- there's great music and tables have a mix of people working and people talking. After going to Lux for about six months, I think what keeps the regulars coming back is the environment -- their atmosphere is top-notch and the workers are helpful. It's constantly packed, but you still manage to find a place to sit. The menu has enough variety to keep you interested. I love mornings when there's a DJ around. It's understandably busy on weekend mornings, but there has clearly been some effort to make the process more efficient. I say plan to wait a little bit if you go for brunch; the coffee and bakery are better order options if you don't have much time.",

One of the times I went on the weekend they had a DJ set up playing music. It's a nice touch, however a little loud to have a conversation with another person.  They have a couple different sitting areas so take a look around.  I suggest going earlier, because when 9am hits, it's almost difficult to find somewhere to sit. There is a nice enclosed patio as well. Prices for food are on the high side in my opinion, but I'm sure it's due to the trendiness of the place. Food and drinks are very good! I really enjoy the latte as it's not mostly milk like most places!",

Happy food conversations, enormous figurative painting of the Grand Canyon, and two big pink armchairs just for us. I enjoyed my coffee and stolen bites of super soft and tasty scone thing. After we left and I sat in the airport for hours eating terrible food I'd wished I'd just stayed here instead, getting lost on the way to the bathroom and eating whatever that crispy pizza thing was my neighbour ordered, and people watching in the unexpectedly beautiful oasis in a (to me) strange desert town.",

I don't go there if I depend on the WiFi because it never works and I don't know why they don't replace light bulbs, but if you don't need to see anything you're working on then I highly suggest going at night.

Their menu is surprisingly homey. I ordered garlic mashed potatoes and broccoli, but they had run out of broccoli. I saw a bowl of avocados and asked if I could just sub them instead.

Next time definitely trying whatever concoctions they have at the bar.",

    "text": "I have been a regular \"Lux\" drinker for years, and I stop by there at least 1-2 times a week if I can. I live up in Cave Creek, so believe me...the drive is worth it!  The Cave Creek Coffeee Company near my house has been going downhill fast for years (the coffee now sucks that Dave the owner is gone, and the attitude has gotten much worse. If I see another over- aged Harley biker wanna be... I'm gonna puke lol), and lets face it - when you get past all the artsy visuals, ambiance, wi-fi and the rest...in the end it is about the quality in the cup.   In that department LUX truly kicks ass as the best coffeee in this town on many levels.  LUX is serious coffee - from the freshly roasted beans on premisis to the perfectly foamed lattes with artisan leaves created within the foam (try to get that anywhere else in town, including at the overrated Presse)...the barristas here know their Joe and take no prisoners.   The mocha's have just the right balance of bitter chocolate and sweeteness, without being cloying or over bearing and the result is a nice balance of flavors that flow past your tongue.   I generally drink my espresso straight, and at LUX it is obvious that the perfectly toasted nutmeg colored crema that the barristas pull is long lasting and as good as anything you'll find in Italy or Seattle, As soon as you walk in the door you can inhale the fresh roased beans and the wonderful smells wafting throughout.   The goodies and cakes here have generally been pretty yummy, but I come here for my Espresso fix and so do other serious espresso afficionados.  I noticed a few Yelpers deriding the \"crowd\" here as pretentious, but I have to totally disagree.Honestly I find the vibe refreshing compared to Cave Creek or Scottsdale pseudo/Harley Davidson chic with coffee that tastes mediocre. Yes, many of the college crowd here have full arm tats or are pierced, and you might even mistake this for an Apple Computer laptop camp. But I have always found the LUX bar staff to be EXTREMELY friendly and helpful, especially a gal named Shadie (probably mis-spelled - from Sounth Africa). The people here are just hanging out, lying on the comfortable furniture, or even falling asleep after a good cup o Joe (figure that out!).  The music and regularly changed artwork is nearly always cool and hip.  There is a reason that the New York Times ranked LUX the #1 coffee spot in all of Phoenix last year - the Espresso here is the real sh@t.",

    "text": "I love Lux. I love it. My friendship with Lux has seen me through three past relationships and a current relationship, which is astounding. I would marry Lux, but my life, my lover, my lady, is the the sea (ha ha, I got jokes). I've been going to Lux forever. Sometimes sporadically, but for the past year every Saturday except when I'm out of town, and when I'm out of town and it's Saturday, I miss this g*d*mn place. I went to a sushi place a month or so back and the server there recognized me from when she worked at Lux years ago.   People mention the too-hip crowd, but I have to let you know that they're the kind of too-hip kids that used to be fat in high school. I've never had a bad experience with anyone here except the little kids who make faces at me or offer me their stuffed animals while I'm in line, those d*mn kids (jokes, again). There was, of course, one time this guy tried to take my place and mark it with his apple computer before I even got up from my seat, but I scolded him like a puppy (a strong \"NO!\") and told him he could have the seat when I decide to leave. You might think, \"well, if you don't recognize the too-hip kids, then you, too, must be a too-hip bastard,\" but let me tell you, I'm 31-going-on-65. My goal in life is to become a golden girl, I am currently really excited that there might be a concert band I can join, and my blood pressure goes over the top when I throw rocks into the ocean. Hip, I am not.  Mad props to the owner and his boisterous voice, Shadi (I don't know how to spell her name but she's there most Saturday mornings), the newish counter lady with the short red hair on Saturdays, the many rotating coffeemaking dudes, and the dude who sits in the corner on Sunday by the roaster room and plays music from a laptop over the speakers. There's also a coffeemaking dude at night whose name I don't know, but he's hilarious. You know it's been a rough day when I'm rolling in at 9:45 pm to get some caffeine, and this dude always makes me laugh. He's one of the too-hip people there with thick rimmed plastic frames.  I just realized I posted a review without reviewing the product. OY! The espresso is great. I've never experienced the drip coffee, but I've gotten various espresso drinks from cappuccinos to dolled-up espresso mochas. They're consistently fantastic. I can think of two occasions I didn't like the espresso, and they were both drinks in which I decided to go with soy milk. Every so often, I pull a hippy move and decide to try soy in coffee. It's horrible no matter where you go, so I don't hold it against Lux.",

The people who work there are pretty cool, they made me a couple great big mugs of hot tea and I had a crazy amazing brioche with huge chunks of sweet apples. awwww yeahhhh!  I would give it 5 stars but it is a bit on the pricey side, the atmosphere could be better and there are NO seats at lunchtime. I was standing around for a good 15 minutes like a jerk with my laptop waiting for someone to leave. It seems like they might be able to make more room but its hard to say what the rest of the building is used for.   At any rate, the best thing about this place isn't the place, or even the coffee and food- its the people. The employees are friendly and funny and the patrons are really, really cool. I met 2 people there I knew from Twitter who introduced me to another friend, who in turn introduced me to yet another person. There is a great buzz in this place, lots of people thinking, working and talking all fueled by caffeine. I had a ton of great conversation and thoroughly enjoyed myself. Looking forward to returning.",

I mean, The Smiths, the Cubs improbable 2003 playoff run, a pound of extra-lean Rudy's barbecue ...  ... and now, my run at Lux.  Its like reading a bad book past the first ten pages.  There are just too many OTHER good ones out there to waste your time drudging through this one.  This rule applies to Lux.  My Saturday and Sunday hangovers have now come under the authority of Copper Star.  Don't get me wrong ... had I written this 5 months ago, i would have decreed that my first born would be fashioned with the couture name Lux, I'm sure.  But when I took a step back, I realized I was always really uncomfortable there.  The set up is all wrong.  Its brutally uncomfortable, especially perching my fat ass on a 2 foot wide, pine bench like I'm Sean Marks (trust me, he's a Phoenix Sun that never plays) just to smoke a square.  I'm even tired of the uniform: Seven Jeans/Ironic t-shirt -- possibly with a reference to something delightfully obscure like Herve Villechaize.  The drip coffee ... two thumbs 'meh'  The vibe ... cheeky and flippant.  Just to radical for my hang-over necessities.  Okay, I loved their toast and fresh preserves, but that was a product of their friendly neighbors.  Peace-out Lux.  We had a nice run.  Its not you, its me.  Maybe we can still be friends and hang out again sometime.",

I have on three occasions tried to meet friends to study here (but they all love a loud atmosphere and don't really study, just prop books in front of them in hope the information will fly on a free floating wave length into their brains).

They always have a top notch barista working bar, freshly baked goods from their own bakers, nice selection of music, and that overall hipster vibe that keeps things interesting. For those of you west coast out-of-town-ers, they're similar to Intelligentsia, Ritual, and Stumptown.  When it comes to selecting and serving coffee, they strongly believe in getting the basics right (roasting, grinding, extracting, brewing, etc.) before consuming their time with other details (bean purveying, cupping, etc.).  With that said, their whole bean selection is limited, which may disappoint those (including myself) interested in unique blends and single origin beans.

I just moved here and to have a coffee shop like this, truly one of the best I have ever been to in the U.S., is a huge benefit. The two times I have been I had the quiche which was scrumptious, I did get it twice after all. Come by, you will not be disappointed and you will go away happy.",

    "text": "I love Lux. The new venue is great because there is a lot more room. The only problem is that it's still not enough. This place used to be a great place to just hang and spend the morning on a weekend or weekday. Now it's over crowded and doesn't have that neighborhood feel anymore. Some of the staff is super friendly while others have attitudes.   The coffee is impeccable and the food is delicious. That first sip of my soy hazelnut latte is always the most delicious and compares to no other coffee. This is what keeps me coming back.   If you want to sit for a while, make sure you arrive at the right time. And keep in mind the right time is never the same time. You pretty much have to get lucky to find a good spot. I've started getting my coffee to go. Also, they don't open until 7AM. This is when my shift starts, so I can no longer go before work. A great remedy for this was to buy Lux beans and to brew my coffee in a French press each morning. I'm definitely not complaining about the quality. It's still delicious.   I try to make a visit to Lux at least once a week and will continue to do so....",

    "text": "I had never heard of this place, and honesty, rarely venture West of 7th St.  However, we were having a centrally located, queer friendly group meeting, and Lux was suggested.  I was pleasantly surprised. There seems to be a dearth of cool, laid back, not-too-hipster indie coffee bars in Phoenix, but luckily, there is Lux.  With delicious baked goods (I had a date scone...I don't really even LIKE dates, but the scone was delicious!) including cupcakes and handmade drinks (and you can choose disposable to-go cups or earth-saving ceramic -- love it!), it's adorable. All of it, not just the adorable woman working the register.  We wound up sitting outside, but there was a good deal of room inside too, where people of all backgrounds were busy working away on their macs, with a scattered PC here and there.  Parking was plentiful, something I'm always on the lookout for, and while I did have to wait in line to order, it moved quickly.  I look forward to checking out the Lux a little bit more.  I bumped off a star because my chai was only so-so, but will be back to try cupcakes and a different hot drink",

    "text": "When planning my visit to Lux, I wanted to place an order.  Instead, I found myself thinking about the song, \"Confusion\" by New Order.  Their \"old\" location was too cramped, so moving next door was part of their natural progression.  The new space has plenty more square footage, but the layout of the rooms is a bit of a maze.  It's unclear precisely where to stand to place/wait for your order and there were cardboard boxes and other items all over the floor.  The decor has it's own unique charm with it's mismatched plates and furniture but the furniture pieces are placed so close to one another you practically need to jump over them.  That was a bit much.  What's Lux it trying to be?  Contemporary?  Retro?  It's hard to say.  Even the \"front door\" we walked in turned out to be a \"back\" door.  Why would they throw so much capital into the space without some semblance of clarity?  The food we ordered was OK.  I had a slice of quiche (pictured) which I believe had sun dried tomatoes, among other ingredients.  The counter person was friendly and offered to heat it for me.  My friend ordered two scrambled eggs, hash browns and two slices of bacon (pictured.)  We sat a a table in another room not knowing if a server would ever find us.  A server later brought the food over and left rather quickly; too soon for my friend to show the server the bacon which was just delivered was burned.  My friend gave me a look as if to say, \"How could the server NOT realize this is burned to a crisp?!?!\"  So...my friend had to get up, return the bacon, wait for two more (precooked) slices to sit underneath the broiler a while and by the time she returned, both our breakfasts were cold.  I will say my friend was happy with her coffee and my iced latte was da bomb!  Lux may still be working out the kinks in their new locale.  Once they organize the boxes, furniture and service concerns, they'll be prepped for enlarging their clientele of repeat customers.  If I turn out to be one of them, the path to their small outdoor patio looks inviting and not at all confusing to find.  You may find me there sipping an iced latte and listening to New Order.",

Internet was fast. I came during lunch rush so it was pretty packed and awkward to squeeze into an empty chair.  As people left, it became more manageable. Great for people watching without looking like a creeper (I swear I'm not a stalker though).  Sizes of drinks ran a little small - $5.50 for large dirty chai.  The baked goods looked amazing but I was on a diet and a budget. Great to see cooks right behind the counter making fresh food orders and throwing pastries into the oven. My olfactory nerves were in overdrive.   Only one bathroom of each gender so there were waits at times.  Rooms in the back were a bit quieter than the front but still busy. I also like that they have a bar if you're looking for a drink with some extra kick.  Minus a star because workers seemed a bit robotic.  Maybe it's their job to be efficient but a little personable touches in taking orders can't be that hard to add. They weren't mean or rude or anything, just a little stoic for what I'd expect from an otherwise cool place such as this.",

    "text": "I'm not going to lie - what made me go to Lux in the first place is because there is a character named Lux in the online game League of Legends that I'd been playing a lot, and it caught my attention.  Secondly, I wanted some morning coffee on a Monday morning while visiting Phoenix.  If I were limited to rail travels, I'd tout its easy accessibility it is to the rail, but I had a car, and it's in a convenient location that at worst, requires a U-turn to get to.  Parking was a little sparse, but I was able to get a spot, probably because I was hitting it up after the real main morning rush.  The interior of the place was unique, and sub-sectioned to about three or four different mini-lobbies of some sort.  It's cozy and inviting in most of them, but you better like your fellow man if the picnic benches are the last place to sit.  I went for just coffee, so I didn't experience the food, although lots of people attest to it being really good.  As far as coffee was concerned, out of the five, I guess local coffee joints I hit up in Phoenix, Lux probably had the best coffee of them all.  The staff were all friendly and pleasant peoples, and they mowed through the lines of people efficiently and with smiles on their face.  It's a truly good atmosphere there, and despite the pretty hipster crowd, the air of smug arrogance isn't as prevalent from those who lounge there.  Phoenix as a whole has a lot of great food joints and coffee shops.  Lux easily ranks up there with them, and I'd visit again if/when my travels bring me back out to Arizona.",

There are multiple rooms with couches and tables, quaint corners where you can get some work done. The atmosphere is to the T, and their coffee/eats are delicious. The place can get a little loud and hectic, so bring your headphones or come at an off hour if you're looking to make some power moves with your work. There's something a little Starbucks about the way they run the front, but the staff is friendly and this place has so much to offer over your typical coffee shop experience.   Overall, if you want great coffee and a lively atmosphere, head to Lux.",

    "text": "I so badly wanted to like this place because of all the wonderful reviews and pictures. My experience:  It was very easy to find and I got lucky and got a nice parking spot in the front as someone was leaving. When I entered, it was a bit intimidating. There were people on their laptops and others just conversing and relaxing. When I finally figured out where the line was, I ordered a quiche lorraine, which was way too costy. For one small slide, it is $5! I can get an entire quiche for that price elsewhere. I wasn't sure which coffee to go with, but the cashier at the front was helpful. I got the cafe mocha. I specifically asked for it to be extra hot because that's the way I like my coffee and asked  to warm up my quiche as well.  In less than a minute,  my mocha was ready, so I doubted that it was extra hot as I requested. Not to my surprise,  by the time they brought out my supposedly warm quiche, my mocha was pretty much cold! The quiche was also served cold, so I'm not sure why it took them so long to serve it to me (they were supposed to warm it up). Quiche Lorraines are usually served hot--not at lux apparently.  This saddened me because I was really craving one. I ate it, slowly.  It was not delicious but it was good. The mocha would have been better had it been hot. Other than that, the vibe and atmosphere was not bad. Just a lot of college kids. I don't mind but.... Anyway, I like the typewriters as centerpieces,--pretty cool. I was hoping to make this place my \"to-go cafe joint\" but I'm not sure it's my type. A bit too crowded for me particularly.  I like more laid back type of cafes.... That's just me though.",

I walked in and thought \"Wait...am I in Phoenix or Silverlake (LA)!!!\"   My friend who is visiting for a rotation told me he goes here to study for his boards. Love the decor, vibe, but most importantly, the food!  My friend had the yogurt and granola, I had a strawberry thumbprint cookie, and we each got vanilla lattes. Coffee here is smooth, not bitter, and they top it off with a design in the foam! Lovin' it!   This place is HUGE even though it doesn't look that way from the outside. Plenty of places to sit with your Macbook or a novel and Free Wifi.  I went on a weekend so it was packed, like line-out-the-door packed, but I still didn't have to wait too long to find a place to sit and study.   It's about a 25 minute drive from Glendale so I will definitely be back. Very reasonably priced (if you can afford Starbucks then you can afford this...plus you get WAYYYY better quality). Parking is easy as they have a lot and plenty of street parking. Oooh and I forgot to mention Pane Bianco is right next door with delicious sandwiches, soups, and desserts so you should check it out!",

So I walked up to the cash register. Stood for a minute while the girl rang someone up. Finally a young man helped me, but first he just felt the need to educate me at how it works at LUX. Instead of, \"Hi, what can I get for you!?\" I got a, \"Just so you know the line starts back at the glass, what can I get for you?\" Really!? Is this real life!? How about the line starts wherever the heck your customer wants it to start, because I am paying your paycheck. Nonetheless, I was now at the cash register and realized he didn't ask how I wanted my tea. I then asked  the girl at the register if I can get creme in my tea, and the girl annoyingly told me I could do it myself. Stood and waited for my tea, and realized they must not call out your order at LUX. I walked up to the register (because why would you have a place to pick up your drinks?) and asked if these were mine, which took 3 tries before she yelled at me, \"yeah!\"   Now was my drink amazing? Absolutely not.   So with that said, they will never get my business again.",

Visually, it's almost overwhelming when you walk in for the first time and to be honest, a little confusing. Even at 10 a.m. on a Monday this place was busy. There's no real signage directing you where to place your order so we had to ask someone where to go. I was surprised at how many employees were working. They were everywhere, including standing right next to our table hugging and talking as if we weren't there. That was a little distracting. Lots of people watching and eclectic stuff to look at while waiting for your food.   The coffee was excellent! The selection of breakfast pastry on display while waiting in line was impressive. The food was good. I got the biscuits and gravy with chorizo and eggs. I asked for the eggs over medium and they came out over easy but I ate it anyway since it took a while to get our order. The flavor of the chorizo gravy was wonderful!   Overall, I would go back again and give this place another chance, now that I know how it works.",

    "text": "Great coffee shop best in Phoenix by far! It's right off Central has a good size parking lot and street parking nearby. Also the famed 'Pizza Bianco' is next door if ur looking for some pizza.  As u walk in you have seating everywhere the ordering area ahead of you where they have a large display of baked goods, not a the best sight to look at if you're looking to cut the carbs. Then to the right is more seating and a full alcohol bar. There's even more seating if u go down another hallway which leads to more rooms and to a large outdoor patio. Basically the place is huge for a coffee shop.  I sat at the bar area whipped out my laptop immediately notice very fast Wi-Fi and also a plug power cord below my feet to keep my laptop charged which is key. A bartender/barista came over pretty fast and I ordered a tropical iced teas which was very good.  They also have a full breakfast/lunch/dinner menu. Artwork was plentiful on the walls and the music and ambience screamed hipster cool. Service was fast and everybody seemed friendly. Place itsrlt was pretty packed and I think lots of HS kids come here after school to along out.  Bottom line it's a must see coffee shop in Phoenix I'll def be back with my laptop hopefully to try some other items on the menu..",

I went here early in the morning (7am: that's early). I was hesitant, but I wanted to try Lux for breakfast. The place was pretty empty! Like being first in line to purchase the latest iphone, I was ecstatic!  I ordered the: AUNT GLADYS'S HOMEMADE SALSA OVER FOUR STRIPS TENDER BELLY BACON THREE SCRAMBLED EGGS WHITE CHEDDAR AND HASH - Every bite was delicious!  The iced vanilla latte with almond milk - my go-to drink was great!  We were able to snag a table without turning into vultures. The atmosphere was relaxing and lovely. The only con I have is that you have to wait by the counter to pick up your food, then get your silverware, then self serve water if needed. You leave your dishes on the table or drop it off to the counter. I'm no waitress. It can be hard juggling your plate, coffee drink, and silverware/napkins at the same while walking to your table!  Overall, I was happy happy happy. Thank you, Lux for making me a fan again.",

I have always had a great experience, but lately (the last 6 mos) quite a few of the people there are just rude and too cool to provide friendly service. Sometimes the music is so loud and the workers are singing and dancing around that it is impossible to even think.  If you asked me a year ago what my favorite Az coffee shop was, Lux would have won hands down. Tonight I literally walked out because the guy taking orders was just so uninterested in kindness and providing a pleasant experience I was almost offended.  TWO stars given (not one), because the coffee is still great.",

And if you were so lucky to snag one, you better hope your conversation is cool enough not to get judged.  Mine never are.    Also, come hungry!

The ambiance is pretty awesome for chatting and bringing friends and hanging around. Not the best for getting studying or work done. It gets pretty busy and very very loud. The reason it's not a 5-star review from me is that the service, while speedy, comes with a huge side of unwarranted sassiness. It's a busy place and it's the service industry, so to some degree I guess that is warranted. But, really, it's not. You'll catch a huge amount of it from the baristas. And a note on the loudness of the music: they are not subtle in wanting people to leave. They'll crank the music up super loud and it's usually the most obnoxious dance music. Maybe just go during the day.",

(don't miss it, its a hidden gem)  My friend suggested Lux and I was pleasantly surprised walking into what seemed to be some sort of old warehouse that had been turned into a fun laid back coffee shop/restaurant. There were so many people relaxing enjoying coffee with friends, people on their laptops studying and working and a bar full of laughter enjoying cocktails and food. I had a vanilla latte accompanied by a tasty lemon bar which is made fresh in the kitchen everyday and the menu is always changing. Lux roasts their coffee in house so the aroma when you walk in is absolutely amazing. This seems to be a great place to go if you are new in town and want to meet new people. The atmosphere is very young and friendly, lots of college students.  I will definitely be returning!   P.S. beware... I am told the macaroni and cheese is to die for!",

I had a mimosa that led to two and a fresh pastry after watching them being buttered and baked, To say the least this place has great seating, its much larger than I realized and it was my second time there.

I always heard about great service and even better coffee.  The coffee was better than Starbucks, but how much does that really mean?    I felt the service was subpar.  When I went in for my first visit, I told the cashier that it was my first time in.  I asked if there was anything out of the bakery they recommended, her response was \"everything is pretty popular.\"  I wasn't really sure how to take it.  So I just ordered a muffin and a coffee.  While I was waiting for my coffee, one of the other employees was making fun of another employee, which just made the situation uncomfortable.    I decided to give Lux a second try since, everyone or any place could have an off day.  I would say it was a slightly better experience, but I still got the overall same impression of the place.  I'll keep to the many other fantastic coffee shops in Phoenix.",

I came in around 10:50 pm a girl with long hair in a pony tail and a striped tee was working the register at the coffee side. She was very rude and condescending to my friend and super rude to me when she rung me up, I asked \"is there a problem\" and she said, \"we can make it a problem.\" As a service worker I understand that one can have a bad night but that was definitely uncalled for, she didn't give me a receipt for my order and basically ushered me out. I never write yelp reviews but this is was super uncalled for and unprofessional. Again, I understand she might have a bad day but the way she acted and spoke was unprofessional. I would never speak to anyone else that way. I hope there is a follow up to this and management takes action.",

I would recommend their lattes..... for those who don't like sweet drinks, but not too strong of a taste, order the hot vanilla latte. For breakfast the muffin egg and gravy and the egg sandwich are to die for. Looking forward to my next visit!",

It can be easy to drive right by it, so be on your guard and depending on the time you go there, parking can sometimes be dicey. There have been a few times I park on the neighborhood street next to their shop and walk a little ways, which I don't mind in the least. They have plenty of out door and indoor seating to suit your fancy. I also appreciate that it's always clean and well kept. The staff has always been friendly and helpful too! Coffee is great! My fave is the Black & White mocha which is a drink from the coffee gods! It's smooth and rich, with just the right amount of sweetness! Btw- try their home made whipped in your drink! Their food is great too! I have had several breakfast items and have not been dissapointed, but my favorite so far is the oatmeal. They top it with a mix of cooked walnuts and blueberries! Yum! Don't forget about their quiche either because it's delish! The other thing I really like is their mac n' cheese, jalapeno bacon all the way! Lux is a great place to go for your morning coffee, or any meal really because it has great food and fantastic coffee all in a relaxed inviting atmosphere!",

My husband and I could be considered regulars, we live just down the street and usually pop in twice a week for drinks at the bar. This morning we decided to grab coffee and some breakfast before getting ready to go to work and after spending 5 minutes looking for parking and 3 minutes waiting in line when he asked to order a breakfast sandwich the cashier told him they stopped serving breakfast......it was 11:03....... so after parking and waiting they could let it slide for it being 3 minutes past that? The person in front of us happily got breakfast. Just a shame. Didn't even want food after that. Don't really understand how they don't care for the guest in just the smallest ways. As if putting one more egg on a piece of bread would have been against their policy. Won't be back.",

I went again last Tuesday on a first date, and the place had moved to a much larger building on the same property.  They needed to expand since the place is so popular and crowded (too crowded in the old location).  The atmosphere is still awesome with interesting seating and artwork on the walls.  But even more interesting was my date.  We stayed for 5 hours!  This was the best or second best date of 2011.   However, on the second date she told me that she wanted to be friends because of her complicated life right now.  I'm holding out hope for something more, but meanwhile, I'm going to move on to other women, who I will probably have less chemistry with.    As for the drink and customer service, my iced chai was great, but not one of the best I've ever had either.  They were quite friendly in there, which I greatly appreciated.  Definitely would come back.  Hopefully, on a date which leads to a relationship.  This place is magicial....haha.",

    "text": "Lux is a weekend staple-- Saturday without Lux would be akin to missing a critical appendage.  Well maybe not, but pretty damn close.   As others have said the coffee is fantastic, actually the best I've ever had.  The espresso is always perfect.  I have a weakness for their iced mochas-- really the only iced mochas I've ever liked. Not too sweet, not too bitter, not too anything... just pure awesomeness.  And their whipped cream?  It took me about a year of visiting Lux to discover this sweet surprise, but it is so good.  Still not sure what the special twist is, but it is goooooood.   And their baked goods are better than any I've had at a coffee shop.  Most are made on-site in an adorable little kitchen in the hallway.  My love of baking tempts me to slip in, tie on an apron, and start baking- but I've held myself back from offering unsolicited help.  At least thus far.     The staff is always friendly and always remembers your name (or at least makes a concerted effort to do so). It's generally crowded-- which makes sense, being as it is, in my humble opinion, the best coffee shop in Phoenix... maybe Arizona... maybe the US. Somehow the crowds and loud music never bother me-- and I can always find a seat.   Lux is one of those places that seems like it would be too hip for my taste-- everything about the decor, ambiance, and clientele suggests this, but for some reason, it still feels comfortable and friendly.  Maybe it's the warm embrace of out-of-this-world espresso and brioche.... whatever it is, it's a fantastically addicting way to start my weekend.",

Jake is hands down the best bartender in phoenix. We sat and watched in amazement as he created his masterpieces with care. None of us had anything specific in mind, so all we had to tell him was the kind of liquor we like, he would make a recommendation, and then make it. I'm a whiskey drinker, so he made an excellent (insert name here-because there is no name for it yet) drink, that was definitely what I was looking for. highly recommend coming down here and asking for him!",

I think you MEANT \"cafe au lait.\" It's a French drink, not a Spanish cheer.  Yeah it's crowded. Yeah there are often too many hipsters (my little sister said that she'd have to find some Buddy Holly glasses to wear in next time, so she'd fit in better).

Everywhere I go I look for that special place that doesn't scream St#+%%cks and yet delivers great coffee with outstanding service. Here are my findings so far: Maui - Honolulu Coffee Co. Ann Arbor - The Common Cup, Ypsilanti - The Ugly Mug, Bellingham, WA - The Black Drop, Lettered Streets, Firehouse, and Tony's Coffee, Seattle (So Far) - Vivace Espresso and now in Phoenix - Lux Coffee Bar.  Upon entering the coffee bar you greeted with a smooth ultra urban vibe that is not pretentious, arrogant, nor fake. The service is outstanding, the bakery/deli products are amazing and delicious. The beans are hand roasted in the 'Employee Lounge' and are made into the perfect caramel shots poured into the perfectly stretched milk from a very talented barista.   I know the LUX doesn't need one more review, but I must say that the cool vibe, the fantastic coffee, and the great spaces make for a coffee shop that I might just book a flight to Phoenix from Seattle to visit.   LUX has it dialed in...trust me!",

Those who know me know I'm not trendy or a \"hipster\", but I've never had anyone at Lux \"scoff\" at my Target clothes or un-trendy shoes. And for the most part, everyone I know who goes to Lux really does work while they're there...they aren't just pretending to be on their computer! And if they aren't working, it's probably because the internet is down (which happens a lot more than it should at Lux).   Overall, I really like this place but I can see how one who isn't super trendy or artsy might be intimidated when they first show up. My advice is to go again, a lot of different types of people go there and are really friendly. Plus, the different groups of people will come in cycles...at a certain time it might be inundated with twenty-something hippies with dreads, and another time it might be taken over by 30-something slightly overweight workaholics.

    "text": "As a kid I wanted superpowers. I wasn't picky about it; any power would've been sufficient. Super strength. Super speed. I'd even have settled for being able to break things just by screaming. But alas, instead of super powers all I got where good looks and charm. It's not easy, but I try to live with it as best I can.  Yesterday something happened to me, though. Something extraordinary. Something that cannot be explained with science. Or logic. Or even algorithms (I tried.) I believe I may have stumbled upon the secret to my secret abilities.  Amanda B and I came to Pane Bianco after the Anti-Prop 102/Prop 8 rally. I was hungering for equal rights and social justice, but in the meantime I had to settle for salad and bread.  While waiting for our food Amanda turned to me and said \"I'm going over to Lux. You want anything?\"  And without thinking I said \"Sure. Surprise me.\"  I swear to Cthulu the entire restaurant froze in place. The two girls at the counter, Amanda, even the guy in the make making my salad, everyone, for the briefest of moments, were trapped in stasis by my naivety.   By the power of n00bity, I had stopped time. Fuck. How do I unstop it?  Thankfully Amanda, who over time has built an immunity to my occasional outburst of teh dumb, fixed the situation.  \"Ummmm...there's a lot to choose from. Maybe you want to make it more specific?\"  \"Yeah, hahaha.\" Oh. Great. The girl at the counter has unfrozen herself too, isn't that nice.  \"Perhaps coffee...tea...\"  \"Tea. Iced. Something fruity.\" I tried to laugh the whole incident off, but there was no denying it, we all felt it; I almost broke Pane Bianco with my stupid.   Soz.  After uncomfortably waiting on the patio (my \"ironically mis-matching outfit\" didn't work out like I had planned and the other patrons let me know it), I went into Lux to find Amanda, where I felt the smallest tuggings of belonging. With an interior this tacky, my outfit (comic book t-shirt, rolled up jeans, long black stripped socks, layers of bracelets, pink  faux pearls and business jacket...yeah...) and I fit right in.   If only I had a Mac and a web design project I kept putting off to look at xkcd.   Amanda got me the peach iced tea which I enjoyed immensely.   Peach is one of those fruits, like grapes and green apples, whose actual flavor has been all but lost after decades of synthesized flavors (I predict that in ten years, at this rate, I won't even know what a real grape tasted like).   But Lux's peach tea tasted like real peach. I can't say if they actually used real peach or if they just used some sort of syrup, but whatever they used tasted delicious.   I keep hearing about how awesome their cupcakes are, and in the future I will possibly order one, but first I have to avoid that kneejerk \"Ugh!\" reaction I give when anyone asks me if I want the \"vegan\" option, like that time I giggled and said \"Soy milk? No thanks. I just want regular milk for a regular person\" to the barrista at the Starbucks on my campus.  I will  admit I have an irrational fear of soy, but I am willing to do the right thing and give it a try.  In the meantime, I'm going to see if maybe I can develop a different super power. I mean, stopping the world in its tracks with dumb comments is nice and all, but it's not going to get me featured in any comic books.  I just realized this is a perfect excuse to get some rope and make some people tell the truth.  Given my readers, even I'm afraid of what I'd find out.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for Lux partly because of my desire for independent and unique businesses to succeed but also because I'm an Italophile who loves real espresso and secretly wishes she could wake up every morning in Rome, walk down to the neighborhood bar, and grab a cornetto (Italian version of croissant) and a rich, deep espresso. Since I obviously can't do that, I am always hoping that I can find a place locally that can re-create that nonchalant but cultured atmosphere so prevalent in European establishments and, of course, make some damn good espresso.   Lux definitely gets some points for approximating the refined but casual feel of cafes and coffee shops in places like New York and Paris, and I very much appreciate places that remind us that eating and drinking are just as much an experience as they are about refueling quickly before we go off to our next daily task. However, because \"la dolce vita\" is not just about atmosphere but is also about taste and quality, I have to express my disappointment in the espresso we were served. It just wasn't that good. It was quite bitter, in fact, and it left a bit of a bad aftertaste in my mouth. I kind of expected more from the hype (and from the fact that I paid $2.50 for it).   To be fair to Lux, I've been back since and the espresso and americanos were much better on my subsequent visits. In any event, it's always nice to take a break from the frenzied pace of life and to avoid the Starbucks drive-thrus as much as possible.",

(Damn them for not being open past 10). This is usually the story when anyone spots me here.   I'll grab a small table for myself, plug in my laptop (free wifi), spread out my papers everywhere, then go up to the counter for a large and extremely delicious Velvet Latte. When it's done right, there's a perfect swirl of white cream that forms the shape of a leaf on the surface of the caramel-colored coffee. Mmm.  Since I am ADD I take frequent breaks of course. Like every 3 minutes. Whenever I hear a strange piece of music I really like that I've never heard before (this happens often), I strain to catch part of the lyrics, stick it into Google, find the name of the band, stick it into iTunes and download it. I'm not making that up. Like half my music collection was created through this method. The last few bands I downloaded tracks from are... let me open up my iTunes... Kasabian, Feist, and the Detroit Cobras. I'm not even remotely hip enough to have heard of those before on my own.",

Make sure that when you arrive you give Jency, Eric, Noel and Jeff some serious love - for they are coffee Gods!  There is nothing more refreshing on a stressful day for me than stopping in my favorite coffee shop, getting my usual iced caramel latte with whip and a slice of veggie quiche, sitting on a comfy couch, people watching, and listening to the great music.

I'll have one of those strawberry pastry as well, mmm....so good! Music is a bit off, it was kinda loud.   I think they roast their own beans which I would love to see in real life.

I would recommend this place to anyone who come or lives here but I would come early or later in the day, they do have a long line of people.",

    "text": "I've been to Lux twice since they've made the move next door, and I figured it was ok to give a review. I have been to Lux countless times over the last few years. It has always been the place to see and be seen, with coffee service that is definitely above Starbucks, but I will admit struggles in certain areas.   Lux, in its former space, was a small shop, always packed and definitely had its crowd. If you weren't a part of the crowd, you'd receive a \"look\" of, \"hey, who are you?!\" Look past that and hop in line for a cappuccino and it would make up for it.  The new space, well... it caters to the exclusivity of the \"hipster\" crowd. Walk through the door that you THINK is the entrance... and wander around. The kitchen, espresso bar and cocktail bar are all broken up and there is no definitive flow of service. Also, is that a customer wearing the tight jeans and cardigan? Or is that the staff? Who knows? Luckily I have a friend who works there and was kind enough to show me around and how the flow of service works. If you're not that lucky, best of luck to you, as you're left to your own sense of direction as how to order, sit down, etc. From what I gather, you can order an espresso drink and sit wherever and they'll call your name when your drink is ready. However, I'm not sure about the cocktail bar. The only way I think you would order would be by sitting at the bar? Not sure about ordering food from the kitchen.  I will admit, I haven't ordered any food from Lux yet, apart from a pastry for my coffee. I had a croissant, which was pretty good and went really well with my cappuccino. I'm a fan of a free-pour cappuccino, however the cappuccino that I was served on this visit had the foam scooped on top. This confused me, because I saw other customers order a cappuccino and get one free-pour. Maybe it depends on the barista? Kind of inconsistent. I did sit down at the awkward cocktail bar and order a drink. The bar has normal height seating and a raised bar for the bartender. It's awkward when they lean down and tower over you to deliver a drink. Anyway, I ordered the \"Number 47\" cocktail with gin, Green Chartreuse, St. Germain, lime, mint and cucumber. I'm a huge fan of Green Chartreuse and gin so I was excited to try it. They didn't have any cucumber in house, so they made it without it. Jeff (the owner) commented, \"Well today it's just the 46.\" Hmm... Alright. So I took a sip of the cocktail. It was decent. Nothing exciting at all. It was overpowered by the mint and the lime in the cocktail. It masked the green Chartreuse too much. It really NEEDED that cucumber to mellow out the mint and lime so you could taste all of the ingredients.  Oh well... what can you do when the owner doesn't seem to mind that ingredients are missing?   Overall, props to Lux for being busy at 3pm on a Thursday afternoon and being a successful establishment, which may be from the same established clientele from before the expansion. The coffee and pastry has remained the same, which is ok with me. However, the cocktail bar tries a little too hard, I think. Also, the decor and vibe has definitely turned Lux into the \"hipster mecca\" and excluded the general public from it's demographic. Which, I can't complain or comment too much, because they are doing just fine. The flow of the restaurant is choppy and confusing and the staff is less than considerate (with a few exceptions). There's my two cents, for whatever it's worth.",

You've got all your regular characters - dude who looks like Jesus, hippie chick in her cool hippie skirt, aspiring artists (one overweight hipster even wearing a beret), couples pulling up on bicycles, old guys reading the paper. Truly local people with a sense of silent comaraderie - you just KNOW not to be yapping on your cell in there.  You can feel comfortable and feel like you can disappear for a few hours.  Good, solid espresso drinks, free WiFi.  If you live in the area, you should definitely be a patron and support this local spot (as opposed to Starbucks down the street on Lola up the street).

I wear far too much plaid for that to be the case.  I was looking for a place in the area for a nice chai latte before heading to rehearsals, and this place had the highest / most reviews, figured I had to give it a shot.  I actually went in three different businesses looking for this one, so right off the bat I feel like an idiot.  I ordered my chai, even though I wasn't sure they had it - because there really is no menu displaying what your options are (I'm certain this is in an effort to be cool).  The beverage was ok, nothing special, but ended up costing me almost six bucks.  I will give them this - the ambiance is pretty amazing.  There are many places to sit and chill, lots of nooks and funky chairs, including a pretty cool back patio.  Outside of that, I just felt out of place and uncomfortable - despite the great soundtrack and pretty people.  So - I'm sure if I were cooler, or younger, I'd dig this joint, but it's just not my cup o' tea.",

    "text": "In my search for a legitimate Chai Latte that embraces the spiciness of the traditional product, Lux has been my answer until I can find a better place. They make their Chai from scratch every morning and it is simply delightful. My other drink of choice here is their fresh squeezed lemonade which could be a hair cheaper but is simply delightful.  The people working here are great and now how to do their job well. Since I spend most of my time in Chicago I only get out here a couple of times a year and some recognize my face after a long absence and try to remember my name. Don't think they have ever gotten it right when they guess but the fact that they try and know I get an extra spicy chai is nothing short of impressive.  You will either love or hate the decor in here but personally I love it. Forget what the style is called but basically if it was 1970 and you wanted to design a futuristic place I think you'd get close to this. Always busy but I have never not been able to find a seat if I needed to stay for a bit.  All in all, this is my favorite cafe I have ever been to right now and I am confident you won't be disappointed. One thing I ask though is that you don't get your coffee \"to go\" when there is open seating. Bring a book and relax for a bit while you enjoy your drink in a \"for here\" cup with beautiful latte art on top.",

I went in today and purchased less than 10 items, mostly meat and some odds and ends I forgot to get.  There was one check out clerk.  There were all kinds of people waiting in line and several with very large (shopping carts full).  I first tried to get the cashier's attention but either the man literally ignored me or was deaf.  I waved my arms and yelled, nothing.  OK so I go up to the front where a very nasty attitude young man responded to my complaint to use the self service line.  I told him I never have and never will use the self service line and I don't intend to start now.  Open another line the place is backed up.  He ignored me.  A lady employee saw I was really getting irate and asked me if I wanted her to help me use the self serve line and I replied NO I want you to keep having a job.  With this I again asked the young man to open another line or I was going to FRY's and he responded, fine have a nice day.  This happened around 3pm 2/26/15.  I have no intentions of being a cashier and if a store wants my money the least they can do is not FORCE FEED ME SELF SERVE.  I really don't give a dam about greedy stores wanting to get rid of more employees.  I walked out and I really think that we should stop being puppets and allow stores to dictate to us but to cater to us or the he** with the store and go to stores that still have customer service.

Staff is very friendly and Sammy is a good guy who helps run the place. Thanks for opening your doors Lux.",

The type of customers who go to Lux greatly varies depending on the time of day. I showed up one day at 8 am and the line was to the door with mostly middle age- older customers. But then you get there at 9 pm and it's 100% full of hipsters. The drinks at the bar are great. I usually have no idea what I want but the bartenders are wonderful about creating something I never knew I loved. My only issue is that it can be difficult to find a seat sometimes. Also, their macaroni is fantastic. Don't think, just order.",

And the places to sit are all very hip, cool set-ups - not just 10 look-a-like tables and chairs.   My only problem? How they've laid out their customer flow. One prob at the old place was there was always an awkward bottleneck of people waiting for their drinks... and to my amazement, they've cloned the problem at their new place! Unreal! Whoever space-planned the new layout should be shot! \"i have an idea - because this place gets really busy, lets direct the long line of people into a little circle in front of the register, make this the same spot people wait for / pickup their drinks, and also the same place people use the condiment bar, and we'll have everyone awkwardly climbing over each other. Perfect!\"  That said, their coffee is still the best in town. So there's that too.",

    "text": "The brewed coffee is okay, depending on the roast. The espresso drinks are disgusting. Their \"house blend\" used for their espresso drinks is WAYYY too roasted. Honestly, I think they scorch their coffee beans that they use for their espresso drinks. Additionally, they don't rinse the espresso spoons so each drink has burnt espresso residue.  ALSO, their chai is fucking horrible. Worst chai I think I have ever tasted in my life. I basically payed 4.75 for iced milk. Not strong at all. If I want espresso drinks, I usually go to Citizen or Grinders.   Their food is pretty pricey as well and their portion sizes are pretty small. 10 dollars for an overdressed salad? No thank you.   Other than that, if you can over their hipster vibe and the non prescription glasses (which is fucking annoying, did you not graduate from high school???) , the atmosphere is great to crank out homework and it's the only coffee shop that's open late in Central Phoenix.   I'm not old enough to drink at their bar yet, but from what I've seen, it looks pretty nice and they have a variety of alcohol.   Oh and the brown haired girl, I think her name is Sasha, looks pissed off all the time(she is pretty hot though) And the tall white guy, I think his name is Sammy, is pretty bi-polar. Sometimes he is nice; other times he's an asshole.",

I had a very productive time there with the accompaniment of a nice atmosphere, beautiful display, good music and of course delicious coffee. I ordered the velvet mocha to start. It was rather sweet, but sweetness isn't always a bad thing. By lunch time I was famished so I ordered the pulled pork plate. I was happy to see veggies mixed into the meal as well as good sourdough bread sliced thinly to complement pork. The pork was very tender and the portion size was enormous. I had a lot of eyes gravitating towards my meal. Oh so delish. After a few more hours, I ordered the hibiscus tea and must I mention there are free refills so before departure, I got a refill of tropical iced tea with a touch of the organic orange blossom honey made available on the side bar. I was rather impressed with the space availability even if I shared a 6 seater table with another person. He was nice himself and inquired my whereabouts. I thoroughly enjoyed this place. I even took the light rail which was literally on the same street of the cafe. Convenience at best with a touch of lux-ury.",

    "text": "I can't believe I waited this long to try Lux. I'm new to Phoenix and had just about given up on trying to find a place to go and sit and work around creative people AND get good coffee while I'm there. As an academic, I've kind of built my life around working in good coffee shops. So when I moved here I figured I'd have to rethink all of that. Not so! Lux is my new fave.   The coffee is real: espresso drinks are made by hand, not machine. I agree with others here that the beans aren't that great though. Even though it's not the absolute best coffee I've ever had (I'm a lifelong Peet's fan), it's certainly not reason to skip going here.   On the other hand, the service is AMAZING. They remembered my name, made sure I got stamps on my frequent buyer card, and offered to heat my croissant in a REAL TOASTER and not some lameass microwave. I got a nice little pot of jam and a smear of real butter, too. They seemed to know I was new there, which indicates to me that they have a ton of regulars and make a sincere effort to get to know them.  There are plugs and free wifi and I don't feel pressured to leave before I'm ready. Lots of great people-watching, too. (Last time I was there, a woman in her mid-30s wearing a Slint t-shirt came in with her kid-- very cool.) There's nothing dirty about this place and I don't feel like I'm sitting in someone's basement, drinking coffee off of thrift store furniture. It's very much an adult coffee shop that encourages you to hang out for a while, either indoors or out. (FYI, there are nice benches and grassy spots around the building in addition to the tables under the awning out front.)  I only wish it were bigger, a little quieter, and much closer to where I live. I also wish it opened before 7 but that's just because I need something to make me want to get up earlier and get working.   To be honest, since I moved to Phoenix 6 weeks ago I thought I was doomed to a life of grading my students' papers from any number of commercial or mediocre coffee shops. I have also had a hard time finding places to go where my people are at. You can imagine what a sigh of relief I expressed when I settled in with my cappuccino at Lux. So nice to be there.",

You can really get creative with your lattes here and their selection of desserts is always interesting and changing.   The space itself is what really makes Lux a winner. The place is surprisingly huge with plenty of seating, but it gets crowded quickly, especially at peak hours so be wary of this if youre coming in with a big group or to study. That being said, Lux boasts one of the most homey and earthy, yet diverse interiors of any local downtown coffee shop, which makes even the large crowds worth bearing. Come in the fall or early winter time for some lovely outdoor seating or come in the evenings to enjoy a DJ and watch this place transform into a chill late night hangout spot.   Parking here can be a bit of a strain and even trying to find it when driving down central. I always seem to miss it the first time. But alas, maybe that's more my incompetence.   Things I would recommend here besides the coffee? The jalapeno Mac and cheese definitely. The coffee crumble cake is also an unexpected delight. I'll be returning to try some more of their wide assortment of pastries so more reviews of Lux must-haves coming soon.",

    "text": "I'm only reviewing Lux Central now because I was waiting for the breakfast sandwich to digest. It took 2 weeks, and I'm not kidding.   We stopped here on our way to the airport. We were looking for some good coffee after mediocre cups all week long, and chose Lux Central based on the reviews that raved about their coffee.   This place is hard to find. To find parking, you have to turn down the side of the building, and you'll see their lot. When we got there, the lot was full, so we ended up parking down one of the side streets. Luckily, someone was leaving. This all happened before 11am on a Friday morning.   Their coffee was not good, it was watery and lacked taste. Sure, I'm a bit of a coffee snob, but I was sure anything would taste better than the hotel and resort coffee I had during the week. I was wrong. So wrong. Disappointing.   We ordered 3 breakfast egg sandwiches, 2 without bacon. They forgot one of them, and we had to spend another 10 minutes waiting for it, on top of the 20 we had already waited because it was so crowded. Boo. They only had 1 cook working?  The sandwiches were hot, but they were soaked in cheese and left a rock in my stomach for 2 weeks. My girlfriend couldn't even finish hers.   They have a pretty extensive breakfast menu. Perhaps the other menu items are better, but I think it's pretty hard to screw up a breakfast sandwich.   If you're looking for some good coffee and a breakfast sandwich in a hurry, look elsewhere.",

    "text": "Back in high school, my friends and I would walk here for coffee after school, and it was always THE hangout spot on Friday nights and weekends. Several years later, I still love this place, and live and die by their house-made chai. I love that it's not artificially sweet, isn't too heavily cinnamon-flavored- it's a good spice blend, and pairs well with alternative milks (they have almond, soy, and coconut!!). The coffee is roasted in-house and even a simple latte is beautiful and perfectly balanced! The drip coffee is also delicious and is a screaming deal considering the quality of the coffee, plus you get free refills! The WiFi is strong, the vibes are good, and the music is super chill. Some yelpers have complained about the music being too loud, but I think it's just the right volume so you won't overhear your neighbor's conversation, and can work without your thoughts drifting too much.  The food is also amazing, and they have great pastries that they bake in-house with options for gluten-free, paleo, and vegan. My one suggestion is to make sure you charge your phone and/or laptop before coming to do your work here because many seating areas are not near outlets so if you plan to spend a few hours here, you might run out of juice.",

For whatever reason, most of the time that I come in and hear loud talking, it's coming from the staff in the bar area. Today was no exception. but not just loud, but using inappropriate language. I get that the music is loud and you guys are striving for a cool vibe but I don't need to hear you're personal conversation and foul language. I was not sitting at the bar but well across from it, where you order the food. Initially, I thought it was a loud group and then when I looked up it was the staff.  I know I have to deal with public customers, but staff should be held to a different standard. The other reason for two stars is because every time I'm here there are flies all over the place. I'm constantly flicking them away from my hair. Maybe it's my shampoo but it's really annoying.",

So versatile! I can say that I participated in all of the above.   The coffee is delish and their pastries are great! They make everything right there which is always a bonus. The mac n cheese is TO DIE FOR! Seriously, don't go without trying! Their alcoholic drinks were also unique and super tasty.   The environment is super fun, sometimes they even have a DJ there mixin' some beats! There's tons of amazing art on the walls, and they even have a projector and put games and whatnot up to watch. You can tell that the staff is proud to be a part of something so special. They were also so friendly and willing to make a suggestion.   Whether you have work to do, want to grab a bite to eat, or wind down with a nice drink, stop by Lux, they got it all!",

This place is very relaxed and every part of this coffee shop has its own little taste of individuality. The major plus was in the back where the big screen tv is at... friendly staff, great music, free WiFi and it was just an AWESOME experience.

It is bustling, offers interesting seating arrangements, and a list of unique concoctions/food items - all of which would make this cafe a wonderful place to go with a group of friends. I will say their home-made cream is AMAZING! With all that aside. This location has become a tourist attraction which means it floods with people during the weekends. Parking is a challenge and seating can also be scarce. This is not your hide-in-a-corner-and-study cafe. The music and ambiance forces those interested in studying/reading to put on headphones and escape. Overall - good for those looking to socialize in a busy cafe but no so great for those interested in being productive.",

It's very unassuming to the point you may think you are walking into an old abandoned warehouse or somewhere but once inside you find some of the best home grown coffees, fresh baked pastries and desserts and best bar with the coolest bartenders. The vibe is hang all day and anyone is welcome with a sometimes dj even during the day and free WiFi.  I come for breakfast and get the quiche they always have at least 3 options that's my fav breakfast dish but they have a bunch of hot stuff. The macaroni is the best in town. That's my word. And if your feeling fancy fancy add veggies to it. I sometimes just stop in and grab a macaroni it's a healthy portion too so you can share. Yesterday I popped in for afternoon cocktails and had the Black Manhattan it was delish. I'm just always satisfied. The playlist was on point yesterday too. I'm never here less than 2 hours because it's a vibe!",

A bit on the pricey side but still worth a try.    Other Yelpers have mentioned this place being \"hipster\" and yes, it's soooooooooooo hipster - it's intimidating.  Like I said, I have frequented Lux, almost daily, yet they have not offered me a \"punch card\" -- the only reason I knew about it was a co-worker told me about it (buy 10, get 1 free, or something along those lines).  Kinda bummed me out cause I like saving money and I've been a frequent customer...  I also order the exact same drink every time yet they don't remember nor do they remember my name (or how to spell it correctly) - which is cool, I get that they aren't mind readers or are supposed to remember who you are or whatevers but still, maybe more customer engagement would be nice.

The parking lot is small and is located at he back so you'll be entering through the back. There are two fairly large dips going from the street to the parking and back to the street so lowered cars should park on the street. It was even hard to clear with a standard car going at parking speed.   The place was packed with lots of students when I visited. There were no empty tables or seats. The line for drinks was about 6 ppl deep but it moved fast. This place serves a wide variety of food and drinks from coffee to wine and from cakes/pastries to cooked meals. This place is a one stop wonder. Get your breakfast lunch or dinner at the same spot.  The handcrafted coffee drinks selection is bigger than many places so you get lots of interesting choices. I had the velvet latte drink in a large size. I love the fact that you can pick larger sizes for a little bit more as opposed to other shops who don't give you that option. The velvet was fairly sweet tasting. I think it'll be better with a little less sweetness or probably an additional shot in this drink would do the trick. The drink tasted ok, not among the best lattes I've had but it was good enough.   3 stars for the drink, 1 star for parking, 5 stars for a wide variety of offerings, and 5 stars for opening real real late. No other places gives you high quality coffee at midnight. Overall 4 stars.",

The vibe was less of the impassioned conversation and music I remembered and more like the basement of a college memorial union. This was all fine but the service was not good. The guy at the register was really struggling. He was not friendly or attentive to my questions and kinda flung the tea selection at me. When I chose one, he said they were out of it but looked just a little harder and found it. Next I asked that my gallette (quiche type pie) be heated and he put it in the oven and looked right at me and said, \"what can I get you?\". When he realized it was still me, he rung me up the wrong amount. I had to correct him and then he dropped some change before giving it to me. Several customers got helped and still no acknowledgement of me waiting for my food. I finally asked someone else and she got me the gallette and she was very nice. It took me a bit to find a seat but then I tried the gallette and it was cold, like the guy at the register forgot to turn it on. I asked the girl who got it for me and she \"heated\" it again and brought it to me and it was only slightly above room temperature. At this point, I just ate it. It was tasted fine and the girl was nice but overall, the place was struggling.",

    "text": "I've heard a lot about this place, so I decided to make the trek out to Lux Coffeebar and get some work done. There's a parking lot right next to it with ~15 or so spots. Or, you could street park for free, but it seemed a  bit packed bc the nearby apt residents park there I think. It's in the same vicinity as a pizza place as well.  I slipped inside and it was darker than I imagined it would be. Fairly full - and I went at noon on a Friday. There were tons of pastries and baked goods [~$1.50-4] behind a glass barrier - leading up to a line of people ordering at the cash register. All the workers were so friendly.  I just ordered hot coffee to stay [$2], which comes in a ceramic coffee cup and free refills! The coffee tasted very smooth and not bitter at all.   The seating/table arrangement is very interesting - a combination of regular tables and just armchairs w/ coffee tables and a bar. Lux was also louder than I expected it would be - the music was playing fairly loud in the background, which made everyone else speak over that.  But overall, I would love to come back and try their actual food and sweets.",

    "text": "When my wife and I are feeling particularly crusty, we like to make the drive to Lux.    Any given time you go to Lux you should expect a few things:  First, an insane amount of people crammed in to every nook and cranny of this eclectic space. People from all walks of life line up to get their coffee.  Seats are insanely difficult to come by.  People smell bad many times, and everyone is very occupied with what they are doing. The DJ in the corner is playing some strange granola-y music that you've never heard but makes you feel cool just listening to it.  Atmosphere is ON POINT and LIT and all that.   Whoops, what really should have been first was the insane parking situation.  There are rarely spots in the lot, so you might have to park on the street, which, really I would recommend first since the lot is a bit toxic (last time I squeezed into a spot there I was greeted with a nice note filled with expletives from my parking neighbor talking about how he should have scratched my door, etc. for parking so close to him).   Really, these two first points just add to the appeal of Lux, because it makes it feel that much more urban.  The coffee is great here.  The light roast is on point.  However, you haven't lived until you've asked for some \"whip\" in your coffee.  Just do it.  (My aunt always asks for a \"'skosh of whip\" and is known as the skosh lady for that reason).  My only gripe with this part Lux is the fact that an \"iced coffee\" costs like $4 or something insane like that.  I think they just pour a double shot of espresso over ice, but really that is an insane price.  It's tasty, but I'd almost rather get hot coffee and ask for a cup of ice.....  The pastries and baked goods are great and there is always an assortment to choose from.  They also have a full breakfast and lunch menu and everything I've had is great. I've vowed to my wife that one day I will splurge and spend my savings account on the NY Strip and eggs menu item.   Anyways, Lux is awesome, and if you don't like it you're probably wrong, because it's the type of place that you should like even if you don't like it.  Mostly because they have identity and understand what they are.  I think that's cool.",

    "text": "Lux is my favorite breakfast/coffee shop in Phoenix. Everything on the menu is super delicious and filling!  For coffee I love sweet and milky, so I get an iced velvet with extra velvet (basically an extra sweet white mocha). I love them so much I wish their iced cups were even bigger! But another large to go works too  ;) Oh and don't ever forget to ask for their homemade whipped cream!! SO GOOD!  The ambience inside varies on where you sit (couch, bar, back rooms), but either way you'll feel so relaxed and hip. They do get pretty busy, and although it has never happened to me, I imagine sometimes there isn't anywhere to sit.  For breakfast, I typically order the Aunt Gladys. It is SO much value on one plate!! One big stack of hash browns, scrambled eggs, bacon, topped with some delicious salsa! It's super filling and I can't rave enough about the quality of the bacon. It's a tender belly pork bacon and once you try it TRUST ME you'll want to find out where to buy for home!  I have yet to try enough of their famous case items but I'm working on that ;) Lookout for updated reviews!  Bottom line -- if you're anywhere near central, or are like my friends who are willing to take a 30 + minute drive, definitely come in here for a coffee, pastry, or full on meal! You can never go wrong with Lux!",

The service is great and the drinks/food is fresh. The first time I ordered the biscuits and gravy with an iced velvet...AMAZING! I haven't been to another breakfast restaurant that makes biscuits and gravy to literally perfection, and I am very critical on biscuits and gravy! The second time I visited Lux I ordered the biscuits and gravy again with a fried egg on top and a hot velvet. Once again...so amazing! While we were eating they were squeezing oranges and the smell encouraged me to get an orange juice to go. And that is how orange juice is supposed to taste! I can't wait to go back for mimosas next!! This is one of my favorite places and I will keep coming back...and so should you! :)",

Open until 2am, serving coffee until midnight, morning, noon or night this is the place to be! It's relaxed atmosphere makes it the perfect place to grab a corner, sip a coffee or tea, have a cocktail, a bite to eat, a quick treat, work, study, or to just hang out with friends. The coffee is made to order served and designed with flare, feels like a toasty warm hug in a cup! The black and white is my absolute favorite! Even when ordering the to go cups they've taken time to add their foam design flowers or hearts, good to the last drop it's coffee made with love! Add one of their delicious baked goods with plenty of varieties to choose from(loved the blueberry white chocolate cookies) including vegan & gluten free and you're tastebuds will be in hipster heaven! I have yet to really eat their food, except for the amazing Mac N Cheese with jalapenos & bacon, it's comfort food with a kick! I love everything about this place, I'll be back soon!",

Lux provides quality service and food for the locals and visitors coming thru Phoenix. I have not tried any main dishes but they are well known and yes I have only tried the Mac and cheese with jalapeno bacon! It's the best Mac and cheese ever, therefore I might say! Coffee is wonderful, pastries are fantastic also fan favorite is the pop tarts all homemade! So let's talk about the interior it's a very dim and may look like it's packed and cluttered but they do also have different rooms, wifi everywhere so for all your exploring needs! It is in a hidden street but your gps will definitely lead the way! But if you are in central Phoenix, make sure you come by! Stay hungry and cool Phoenix!",

After about 10 more minutes of discussion and questions regarding whether or not I would drink raw eggs (I don't even usually cook eggs, let alone drink a raw one, but sure, I'll try something new...), the mixologist had an idea of what she could make for me.  Overall, the drink was fine.  I wouldn't want to order another and was glad when it was finished so I could stop drinking it.  It kind of tasted like a Christmas tree & pine sol.  And had raw egg yolk in it.  I'd skip the bar portion here - or just get wine/beer.    On another note, the coffee & cookies were great!",

He has been amazing to my friends & me. Not stingy with cocktail ingredients, knows how to have a GENUINE conversation, basically makes you feel like you're the only person in the world that matters.   My friends were craving Micheladas & he made it flawlessly. & theeeen, he proceeded to make a Thirsty Crow that exceeded any of my expectations. Because we're from the Bay, my sister was craving a Philz mint mojito. He didn't know what that was & when we gave him the basic idea, LAWD HAVE MERCY. This guy can mix.   For lack of better terms, I.can't.even.",

    "text": "There aren't many of us out there, but I'm Luxy enough for this to be my neighborhood coffee stop.  Now don't go telling people my dirty little secret; but truthfully, coffee isn't really my 'cup of tea'. You know what is my cup of tea? Tea! and Earl Grey takes top billing. Earl really knows his tea, and Lux has that too. With a few minute walk, bike, or scooter ride from my front door to Lux, the wife and I like making this a frequent stop for a hot beverage or cold, people watching, dessert, or snack outing.   While here, I wouldn't be surprised to see one of the top billed Yelping regulars, out of town coffee pilgrims, or Juan Valdez himself. I'm told by my buddies and my girl the coffee here is just that good.  Lux has a menu of fresh baked pastries, goodies, and other breakfasty items, like eggs, veggies, and bacon. There's also a full bar back there for those of you who venture past the coffee and pastry line. Careful though, 'cause Lux can get packed during morning, lunch and evening hours with most of the prime spots filled up already by gaggles of laptopians doing a work from \"home\" type of thing.  Now I've not personally worked from a coffee shop before, but I sometimes wonder how much 'work' is actually getting done. Maybe people just claim to work and are really just hanging out for the uber cool ambiance or the free wifi. I think Mr. Valdez did have is iPhone out the other day trying to connect up to the Yelp app.   The walls here are spotted with local artistry that is on a seemingly endless rotation. Come back in a week or so and you might find something new hanging up there. If your a light rail fan, pop off at Campbell and Central and stop on in!  Happy Yelping Phoenix! It's time for today's caffeine fix.",

The menu used to be imaginative but is now dull. They used to employ a chef now there are just cooks (who try extremely hard). The cooks are great but need guidance. With that said, the mixed drinks are outstanding (along with the beer selection). The staff work their hearts out and appear to enjoy their jobs. Very friendly folks.   The real disappoint is the appearance. The furniture is falling apart, upholstery shredded and it has a dirty feel.  I mean OMG a homeless shelter is in better shape!!!!!! They use the walking space to store food. If you are in a wheelchair forget it. They have packed the tables, chairs and logs so close together that even on crutches you are risking additional injury. If there is a fire your life is in serious danger because one fire exits is blocked and the large heavy door to the \"patio\" maybe locked. And, I believe, at times, it far exceeds legal occupancy. The ADA and the City should send inspectors.  Come on owners, I realize profit is king. However, please don't fall into the typical pattern of a great and amazing start followed a year or so later by mediocre dinners and no concern about keeping the place in at least good condition. With the money you appear to be making I think you can afford an upholsterer.",

    "text": "My friend and I woke up this morning craving croissants and she suggested I stop by the Lux to and buy three.   I stood in line and looked over the baked goods but did not see any croissants. As I waited, I watched a young, skinny, hipster wearing a trucker hat taking a middle-aged woman's drink order. His eyes rolled several times as he scribbled on the paper cup. As he set it on the back counter for the barista he turned around and faced me. It was my turn to order.    I went to college in Portland, Oregon and live near Hawthorne and 39th where hipsters run the streets like rats in a Mumbai sewage ditch. All the cliches, the tights jeans, smoking Lucky strikes, bicycling everywhere. The predictable clothes and messy hair? Fine. What I can not handle and the reason I am sitting here writing this review (with croissant crumbs all over my shirt) is the attitude.  I know hipsters and the games the play.   I asked the guy if they had croissants and he looked quizzically at me. After a pause he told me that they did have them earlier in the morning. Another pause and he told me he would check to see if there were more.   He then stood there staring at me for maybe 8 seconds. I decided to play the game and stared back. We were locked in eye contact for maybe 8 seconds. He then sneered and found the croissants.   He was very questioning of taking them to-go and seem very confused and disgusted while putting them in the to-go box.   The young woman at the cash register never made eye contact and, like the croissant guy, looked befuddled and annoyed by my standing at the counter and ordering croissants. Swiping my card was a a chore for her and handing it back to looked arduous for her.   As I drove home I felt judged, deflated, and angry. The only thing that made me feel better was the croissant. I warmed it up in the oven and covered it in butter.   Good croissants. A-hole staff.",

I'm not super familiar with the food but anything that I've ordered in the past has been fine. Personally, I cannot study or work here because I get too distracted with how many people come in and out but that's just me. The staff here but they are all nice enough and they make consistently good stuff.   One thing that seems to annoy me every time, however, is their stamp card promotion, or lack-thereof (you get a free drink after buying 10). It is totally worth it if you go there often. It might sound dumb, but I always feel like I'm inconveniencing someone to either stamp my card or get a new one. Then, when I get my free drink, it seems like I'm a horrible person for using a system that they have available. If you're a frequent patron of Lux and had no idea they even had these cards available, I'm not surprised. They don't advertise it for some reason. I was going there for years before I found out it was even available. I just happened to be eavesdropping on the the guy in front of me in line. Then when I asked the cashier how long they'd been doing it for, the condescending, teenage, hipster cashier said, \"Uhh, like, forever. It's been years or something. Where have you been?\" Hey, thanks. I've actually been here. Cool response though. That was super helpful. Maybe it's a stupid pet peeve of mine, but I feel like you should let your customers know if you have something to help them out. Maybe I'm just not cool enough though.",

    "text": "Long gone are the days when Lux would have something called Tango Tuesdays, which were Argentine tango lessons being taught right in this here coffeeshop.  That's right. Tango lessons.   A bunch of chairs and tables would be moved back to create an ideal milonga space. Depressed Mode would fade out  for the dramatic strains of Astor Piazzolla. And this random couple would appear out of nowhere and start dancing in the middle of the room while the other 4 people sitting around (me included) would continue working on their laptops or studying. This would go on for about an hour. Every Tuesday.   That was circa 5 years ago, and I never saw anyone else ever get up to tango. Which is probably why it eventually stopped. A missed opportunity, in hindsight. I could have made major headway in Phoenix's numerous tango halls. Alas.  Today, Lux is even more bustling than it used to be (sometimes overly so). A full-on Apple army on every table and couch inside, while actual human interaction (aka talking to your friend) is mostly reserved for the outdoor tables.   But long gone are the days of being treated by an oftenly complained about surly cooler-than-thou barista. Don't get me wrong. There are still cool baristas working there. But service has been consistently excellent and friendly for quite a while now to every customer that walks in. They also still make great coffee product (caffeinated soy lattes and decaffed Americanos are my usuals nowadays - and apart from one bad mishap years ago, the espresso is always done just right and the soy is never curdled or burnt).  Doing work or studying here - well, that more or less depends on you and whether you can shut out the loud music and continuous cacophony. For me, at times it gets to be too much and I eventually pack up and move to somewhere quieter, and yet other times it all just clicks and I plow right through my work despite all the noise. So take that for what you will.  But as for the music, regardless of the noise level, there's always great stuff on board. And sometimes the most random. Most recent example: a steady stream of Hot Chip tracks followed by \"Party All The Time\" by one Eddie Murphy. Sadly, I was the only one in the entire place old enough to recognize and truly appreciate this unexpected masterpiece. But it served its purpose.  As Lux continuously does, a longstanding gem of a coffeehouse in the expanses of the Arizona desert.   It may no longer have a lone couple awkwardly dancing tango in its midst, but it does serve a pre-bust and pre-Pluto Nash Eddie Murphy crooning overhead for your listening pleasure.  It's the important things.",

    "text": "I've been here so many times, and I continue to come back often. The only way I can write a review now having been here so many times is with pros and cons.  Pros:  -The bakery items- The fresh croissants, cookies, pies and all sorts of tasty morsels are always made form scratch and will satisfy any sweet tooth craving. -The food- at 5:30 every night the dinner menu goes up. There are always a few staples like the mac and cheese, and also new and local daily creations that are every bit as delicious. I have never had a meal here that I didn't thoroughly enjoy.  -The bar- Prices are average, but they do know how to make some damn good drinks. Also they have a decent wine selection. -Coffee and tea- they hand roast all their beans in house. Coffee and espresso are yummy and strong. They have large cups for drinks and have a great selection of hot teas. I'd recommend the toasty almond one.    Cons: -The space- I love the cool hodgepodge/industrial look about the place but a coffee bar, restaurant, and bar all together makes the place seemed a little cramped with storage in all the halls and nooks. Trying to scoot by people without hitting them with your bag is normal.  -The crowds- Avoid coming on the weekends or at dinner time if you are not by yourself. There WILL be HUGE lines and no seats for groups. I have stopped bringing people here for brunch, its just not worth it. Thats how crowded it can get. This is not as big of a problem is you are just coming alone, there will always be a single seat somewhere.  -The seating- there is so much furniture in this place as they try to accommodate more patrons. The bar seats are shoulder to shoulder. And you could be sitting on anything from a super low looks like its from the 50's couch, to a upright plastic reading chair, or a picnic table bench. And all of the furniture is becoming dilapidated from all of the traffic: torn, stained, sagging. Its not that appealing. Outlets are scarce.   Overall I still love the food and drink, and that keeps me coming after work, but I avoid the high traffic times. I like their late hours but find it more crowded. I would still definitely recommend checking the place out, on your own, on a weekday, around happy hour, and you should have no problem finding a seat/outlet, and enjoying some food and beverages.",

The last time I visited (my 4th time, in total) I ordered a decaf americano, and I was pleasantly surprised. After last time, I'm going to give them another chance. -Parking. Is. A. Nightmare.  On the plus side, they have really good dinner foods (mac n cheese) and an (overpriced) wine bar, if you're into that scene/old enough to enjoy that.  Why I updated my review to include a third star:  I visited an old friend for coffee, and she insisted we go to Lux, because she really likes it there. So, we went, and I got a simple cup of their light roast coffee (only $2. Not horribly expensive.) and was, once again, pleasantly surprised. It was smooth enough to drink without cream, milk or sugar.  It was a Friday at lunch time, and it wasn't so busy. There was room to sit down, room to talk, room to wait for my cup of coffee without worrying about stepping on others' toes. It was my first actual /nice/ experience at Lux, and I'm happy about it.",

    "text": "Lux continually makes some of the best espresso drinks in the Valley in my opinion. Their lattes and mochas are something I drive over 15 miles for every week.   There are a lot of other options when it comes to Phoenix, but Lux has a great pastry case to match the coffee. Their lemon tarts, coffee cakes and giant cookies are always good. Only problem is that sometimes the place can get really busy on the weekends and there's nowhere to sit inside. That can be a problem when its 110 F out, but if you go at night there's generally seating available.  As for everyone talking about the \"hip\" scene it attracts...ya there is a lot of that sometimes but everyone is friendly and it's a fun place to people watch at the very least.",

Food is excellent, coffee is great, atmosphere is perfect for the variety of needs one coffee-goer might have and the bar has a great selection of  well thought-out beverages. This is where you go to enjoy quality food/beverages, so if you don't appreciate that (and aren't willing to spend a couple of extra bucks for it) this is not your place. The decor is fabulous and I love that they show all the soccer games in the back room. Try their breakfast & a mimosa- it won't disappoint.",

A large latte is now 5.75, which is almost as much as a cocktail which is 10. The coffee has become so overpriced I do not see myself coming back unless it changes. Furthermore the owner is incredibly arrogant and only ever greets those who are drinking alcohol. Kinda rude considering their coffee cost more than some of their drinks. I will stay that for a coffee shop it's way overpriced. As for food. The breakfast is good, but again overpriced and not as great as places like postinos. Where they thrive is their drinks and pastries. The pastries are, overpriced, but delicious and the bar service is incredibly during nights. You go in and say what you enjoy drinking and they'll often make you a custom drink according to your likes and dislikes. They almost always give drinks on the house and they are fairly priced.",

    "text": "Fly to the Northwest and get some lessons. You don't have to sacrifice customer service for cool. Being new here from Seattle I know my standards are probably too high but the coffee shop is the 21st century pub. The idea that a cross section of community could be in one place is the value a coffee shop adds to community. That old, young, and all the other things that make humans different could come to one place is a pretty great and NOT new idea. I travel a lot, so my kids (15,13, 12) and I have a tradition that has become a pretty important time in their life and a great experience for us. Before I leave on a long business trip we go out late (on purpose) cause my kids think its cool to go out late, to a coffee shop, they usually get a hot chocolate or something and a get a drink, we laugh, drink our favorites, tell stories, I teach some valuable life lesson that they probably don't catch, we post some instagrams, then we go home, they sleep in and I'm gone providing for my family when they wake up.  I am not bothered that this \"coffee shop\" doesn't serve coffee after midnight. I don't care that its a little hard to find (it added to the adventure) or that it was a little confusing when we walked in where to go or who to talk to (felt like we entered somones private club). What spun me is how we were treated. Lets start with - there was someone who worked there folding napkins who I walked past 3 times and finally had to stop her from what she was doing to find out who to order from, she then gave me a dirty look like I was bothering her and when she saw my kids with me she looked at me like \"what the hell are you doing here?\" I knew this was True when I OVER HEARD HER TALKING TO A COWORKER ABOUT US, AND MY KIDS BEING THERE!  Lux if you don't want kids there, hang a sign. And if your going to talk crap about your customers at least text and and take my money so I don't know it. And if you don't like your job, get a different one.  The only positive, and the reason I gave this 2 stars instead of 1 is I finally got some help from the bartender who was pretty kind.  Terrible first impression.",

The layout is  maze like and you will always find your nook and place to sit and study or sip on that delicious cocktail. More so, their beer selection and wine is on par! I was so surprised, as a vino lover, they had the coveted LIOCO chardonnay, this winery is notorious for only distributing to high quality local places, the only other places in Arizona I know of that have this wine? Are Binkleys (fancy!) and Postinos. The food here is also served late and that is key for someone who is out of work late and needs to do some tidy up work but also catch a delicious dinner (vegetarian friendly as well!). I am so happy to see this place transform form the former next door little coffee shop into something this extrinsic and delicious place on all counts.",

The setting is very comfortable for the lounger that wants to just sit and sip a cup of java and carouse the cyber connections out there.  There are cubby places to sit for all tastes, and the folks there filled most of them!  The motif is very earthy and the lighting is just right.

I don't pretend to be an expert on coffeebars especially since I don't drink coffee, but after living up the street for this place for a few months and always seeing it packed when I'd drive by, I jumped at the chance to check it out when some friends were there earlier today.  I gotta be honest, this place was nuts.  I was confused upon arrival and had to look at my watch to check the time because I thought I'd just walked into a nightclub.  This place was PACKED.  I mean not a seat open at 5:00 on a Tuesday.  Music was blaring inside!  My boss called me from NYC and literally asked me if he was interrupting my bar time because it was so loud.  Anyways, loud (bad) music aside, I still had a good time.  The people watching was fantastic.  Such a wide variety.  I mean you had so many different angles covered.  You had your hipsters typing away on their laptops trying to look very important, the tortured artist at the table next to me feverishly writing in his journal, the section that I can only call the hairdresser's corner because all of their hair was immaculately coiffed and standing about 3 feet high, to my friends who were doing actual work at a table, sending out invoices believe it or not.  And then there was me, jaw gaping open the entire time, obnoxiously staring at everyone around me trying to get my bearings.  Since I did not eat or drink anything, I should probably point out that I will be returning to Lux for the people watching alone.  It was that good.  I'd imagine it would be mildly difficult for me to work here with the loud electronica music blaring in the background, but that's alright, I'm willing to sacrifice work for just a little while longer : )",

I almost didn't write this review since I'm at this Phoenix hot spot all the time.  However, I realized something earlier Saturday when I went inside a competitor's store searching for something to satisfy my sweet tooth.    I walked in competitor x, scanned my choices, and walked out.    That's when I made a beeline for Lux.  Hands down, Lux has the best dessert selection around.  Not only is everything made from scratch at this locally owned business, but the quality is outstanding, and in most cases the portions are generous.      Wanna know the best part?  Sometimes the desserts have those crusty edges, you know, like homemade! The chain coffee houses might see this as a flaw - but at Lux the imperfections make this coffee bar perfect.  Lux is across the street from Central High School, just south of the Campbell and Central light rail station,",

    "text": "Lux is the place in Phoenix (I prefer Cartel in Tempe). Their espresso is excellent, and the majority of their baristas really know how to work it.  Most of them are super nice, too (most notably the very cute Jane who may or may not still work there).    Marked off a star because of the occasional totally indifferent barista (one of the guys in particular, though I refuse to name names), as well as the annoying clientele.  I have attempted to start conversations with fellow customers here, but they just are not having it.  I've decided that I just don't want to spend time in such an unfriendly place, even if the baristas ARE fantastic and cute.",

It was in a 16oz cup that costed more then a venti at Starbucks. Was this because of superior quality? Hardly. Hipsters can't make decent cup of joe. Its too mainstream for them. I was in the area, and remember seeing it, so I wanted to give it a try.  The atmoshpere was crowded and cluttered. Overall just messy. I feel like I walked into a sweat shop. OH did I mention hipsters? The pastries looked good. But i'd never purchese anything from greasy hipsters without it being FDA approved. And these bitches were making cupcakes in plain view.  If I ever were to come back, it would be to simply take pictures of all the patrons and post them at <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FLATFH.com&s=7ee0300fae80037063f1a4d9769def4dc50555ae9f049e711a5fc4d5748df267\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">LATFH.com</a>",

    "text": "So I have a bit of a crush on this place.  Lux happens to be about 20 miles away from home passed about just as many coffee shops but I find myself making the trek here several times a week.    I find Lux to be a bit of a love hate kind of place.  Parking can be  a battle because even though there are a lot of spots and on street parking, it can still be a battle finding a place to tie up your horse.  With free wifi and plenty of seating, Lux is a place you WANT to plop down for a while and do whatever it is you have to do but here it's \"coolness\" works against it as even with plenty of seating, It can be a bit like the 101 freeway at rush hour trying to find a place to sit.    I wish I could say the coffee was what brought me in but to be honest, it's average at best.  The SERVICE is pretty good and the staff friendly and attentive.  The food items i've had both baked and prepared freshly have all been adequate (the Mac n Cheese with bacon and Jalapeno was tasty, served in a large portion for the money and well executed but fire roasting the japapenos prior to adding them in would have elevated this dish to excellence!)  So what keeps me coming?  Well, I can't think of anyplace i'd rather to go hang-out, MacBook in hand, to get some work done and people watch.  The atmosphere here is GREAT!  A mixture or modern and retro furniture, exposed beam ceilings, varied work spaces, and locally produced art are on par with and in my opinion rival similar concepts in NYC, Seattle or San Francisco.  Did I mention the full bar?  Fancy an adult beverage to take the edge off of that paper you need to write or the power point you're putting together for the \"big proposal\" at work?  You're in the right place.  The bartenders here will gladly mix you up anything from a classic coctail to a trendy CenPho treat to whet your whistle.  I'd give Lux 4 stars if it were a bar that served food and happened to have coffee.  If your looking for great coffee i'd recommend Press Coffee Roasters, Cartel Coffee Lab or Echo Coffee. Lux is definitely my choice if you're looking for a place to socialize, sit and get a little work done, plow through homework or just hang out and people watch.  If the coffee were better i'd rate it 4 stars but as it stands, they only get the third from me because the whole package is so appealing.",

Outlets are plentiful and it's a great place to get work done. The food is delicious (and if you don't like it pane bianco is next door) and the pastries are dangerously good. The coffee is excellent and roasted in house. They're also surprisingly affordable, except for the meals and alcohol which aren't cheap but Aren't too expensive either.",

I always happen to go on the late nights, so this review may not be accurate for other times of the day.

This coffee shop and bar is always bustling with activity, making for a noisy atmosphere. They are very busy. This makes service and food prep times slow occasionally. But it's always worth the wait. The food and drinks are delicious.   Overall, the staff is friendly. But there have been a night or two when they let their exhaustion eat away at their good moods, and all they really want to do is get your order out and move along.

I'm mainly a morning Lux patron but today I decided on dinner. I've already had the burger, steak, Mac and cheese etc. today I decided on the Tender Pork Belly BLT and mixed greens.  It was the perfect blend. To start, the artisan bread had flavor. Too often restaurants take for granted sides or basic ingredients. At LUX, if it doesn't improve the dish, they don't use it. No microwave here. Just the right amount of Bacon, Lettuce and Tomato with some type of aoli. This is so important. Some places don't focus on the taste but go for a big huge sandwhich filled with one ingredient over all the others. Well.... my big huge sandwhich blended perfectly without trying to pile it on for looks instead of taste. The vinagarette for the mixed greens is outstanding.  I wasn't in a particularly happy mood upon arrival but the down to earth cashier broke out a smile when he greeted me and changed my demeanor. And a double chocolate chip cookie for dessert.  Overall, I am glad I stopped in and am adding dinner at Lux to my options.  Oh and the cocktails!!!! Excellent. This is a unique place you will not find anywhere else",

Their baked goods are out of this world and they always have seasonal treats! Sometimes, i'll meet a friend for one of their drinks by dialect (they literally make you a drink based on your favorite ingredients!). I have loved every drink that they have made for me! Their ingredients are so unique and fresh.   Lux has a super trendy/cozy atmosphere and it is right near the light rail and heart of Downtown Phoenix. I know that i'll be back soon to park and work for the morning/afternoon or to catch up with a friend!",

Coffee was good, although as a coffee aficionado and an avid coffee shop adventurer there are far more entertaining and friendlier coffee shops in the valley. At the end of the day my experience was not terrible, but sub par to say the least. If you're looking for a good alternative to this place I would suggest Altitude Coffee Lab or Cartel Coffee.",

Their Iced Chai is pretty great and their Passion Tea is really nice (charged, but not cloyingly so).  The only reason I give this 4 stars instead of five is because their floors are hard to maneuver if you have a disability like I do. The furniture is somewhat cramped and while it adds to the ~vibe~ it's embarrassing to be slowly and gently leading myself along a very careful path. Also, the stones set into the ground of their outside seating area--Don't get me started on what a minefield those are.  BUT seriously, this place is great. Food, atmosphere, drinks are all 10/10.",

    "text": "I started coming here when they opened. It has changed a lot! For anyone returning after a long time, you'll noticed they  moved into the cooler, larger building next door and gave their old area to Pane Bianco. The current building has an open sitting area but there are also 2 other rooms if you need it, but sometimes it's occupied so plan ahead.  Menu isn't the biggest I've seen but there is still a lot to choose from. They keep fresh food and a full staff on hand at all times so they can handle whatever is needed. You may think the staff comes across as \"too cool for school\" at first glance, but when you talk to them they come across as familiar, approachable and attentive.  Their famous coffee and other drinks are priced how you'd expect. When they were in the old building, I fell in love with the pastries. I was delighted to find that they had expanded on the amount of pastries available. The first thing I bought was a lemon cookie. Then I came back twice for those cinnamon rolls TWICE. I had to come back because they almost always sell out. The good news is, they sometimes make them twice a day. If you have something specific in mind(only if you are specific), just call ahead to see if your favorite item is up or not.  They have a full menu now, which is nice when you want to bring your laptop to do business and then stay for lunch. The meals and are a little expensive but I had a beautiful BLT with the most epic macaroni, which made both worth the price. I enjoyed it so much, I came back the next week with family and we ate breakfast with that same tender belly bacon kissed with a delicious char that was in my BLT.  Yea, everyone knows the atmosphere is trendy, but there are other points to bring out. The buy fresh flowers from the nursery next door sometimes, they keep local art on the wall, and the outdoor seating is great if you bring your well-behaved pet. Interestingly,just like a good Trader Joe's store, they have their own resident artist who keeps things hip and fresh. I would love a gig like that!  Last, I don't know why I like this, but I am in love with their eclectic interior design. Mid-century-modern furniture in an industrial style building with a rustic exterior. They even have industrial-style bathrooms. Someone pointed out to me the bathrooms usually have Charmin toilet paper, which may not matter, but it's the little things that count sometimes.",

This place has really tapped the arse of every possible stream of revenue. Coffee... fancy coffee... freshly squeezed juice, homemade pastries, sweet and savory, packaged cookies, breakfast lunch and dinner, cocktails  If you are lucky. Chocolate chip almond paleo cookies- but if you are GF, make sure to ask them to use a different spatula to avoid cross contamination!  My only gripe - (gosh even typing that word I sound grouchy!)... is that it seems they ALWAYS run out of gluten free baked goods EVERYDAY, VERY EARLY. AGHH! .... Seems like quite the missed opportunity for them. They do a great job at creating what they do, but golly, make MORE. If people ask you all day for these things, and you are always out at 10:00am. hmmm...   Anyways. When out of GF fresh goodies, you will be directed to bagged peanut butter cookies. Blah. No thanks.   Alright enough grouchy lady this morning! I do LOVE this place, love the vibe, the dutch pancake (savory) is crazy good etc.   Every Phoenician should know this place. Just saying..",

I had just sat down in a corner spot and was setting up my laptop, notebook etc. when a very abrasive man asks if we're holding the two seats next to us.  We were not but it was a very tight space so I had my laptop bag and notebook there.  He answers for me and says no, you're not, takes the two seats and then a woman with an infant and one or two other kids join him.  He left us no choice but to pick up our things and move to another table.  He was so entitled and unapologetic.  I kept seeing him throughout the restaurant engaging with the staff so I figured he worked there.  After a quick google search I found out that the rude man was the owner.  I cannot believe that an owner would be so rude to customers.  I hate that this happened because I will not return to a once favorite neighborhood spot.",

While I wasn't particularly enthralled with the idea of oatmeal that morning, I went with it since breakfast with an egg allergy is often a difficult - so one option is better than none.  Holy hell, was I glad I opted for the oatmeal!! This might have been one of the best oatmeals I've had served to me yet! Served in a giant coffee mug, it was covered with a generous pile of warm toasted pecans and juicy raspberries, with a mingling of raspberry juice and (I think) maple syrup to sweeten the oats underneath. It was filling, it was simple, it was delicious, it was heavenly.   As I board my flight back to my home hundreds of miles away, I don't know whether I love or hate them for setting the oatmeal bar so high when I can't go back every time I'm craving this decadent bowl of oatmeal. :)  Coffee was also good!",

What I cannot and will not get over is an unapologetic staff whose epic error led to me breaking 5 years of meatless eating because of an order mishap.  I ordered the red pepper tomato quiche. After 20 minutes waiting for the quiche to warm in what appeared to be a 200 degree oven, I double checked to make sure my name was on the plate at the counter. When I dug in for the first bite, a wave of nausea and panic washed over my after realizing this was a piece of the bacon spinach quiche. I returned to the counter and explained that I had ordered the vegetarian quiche, and the chic who took my order asked the chic behind the counter which one she served, because she was sure she got it right. The chic in the kitchen said she put them out in the order she got them. Then they spent some time looking around in confusion and murmuring a bit,  meanwhile all the quiche had been sold. So the counter chic simply turned to me and send, \"well we don't have anymore of that one.\"  Thanks. I told her I was more upset about the fact that I had just put bacon in my mouth after 5 years of no meat than there being no more quiche. She did give me my money back, but no one apologized or offered me any recompense. I'm over you being cooler than me, but I'm not over you having no soul.",

I've been there many times and that's saying a lot considering I don't live particularly close to the downtown area. I always say that no date night is complete without a visit- it's the type of place where you can plop down on one of their comfy couches, order endless shots of espresso and stay up all night talking. The staff is very friendly. In fact, I came in on a particularly busy night (weekends get crowded but I've never seen it like THIS) and a worker stopped and had a good ten minute conversation with me, just chatting. Sometimes, great customer service really does say it all. Also, remember those scrumptious baked goods that I mentioned? They are AMAZING. I tried their flourless chocolate cake and it absolutely knocked my socks off. One last suggestion? Hungry or not, try their mac and cheese, you won't regret it!",

PS...if you ever want to smell what heaven smells like, walk down the back hallway.  The baked goods smell is AMAZING.",

    "text": "Lux is one of the best places to have a cup of coffee in central Phx.  The drinks are pretty good; they used to be better a couple years ago.  Maybe they changed there espresso, who knows?  I love their new location: it's designed so well.  I love mid-century furniture, so it's still a pretty nice spot to have a cup of coffee with my girl.  I haven't had the food yet, but I will soon.  Since they now serve food and drinks, there is more of a reason to go to Lux.",

    "text": "I went to Lux a few years back and had a really bad experience that made me not want to go back. In short, I'm a friendly guy and the owner was behind the bar and while he pulled my coffee I tried to chat with him a bit. I found him to be such a rude douchebag that internally I said 'This place will not last.' I took my coffee and left and figured I'd try the next place to open in this spot.  Well, Lux is still around. And so am I. And Monday night we met again And I was very pleasantly surprised.  The coffee was not that great - a bit too acidic. But that's a personal taste issue, so I'm not going to spend any time on that. The place itself is great. The couches and chairs have a very pleasant lived-in feel. There were MANY people in there, but it felt cozy, not crowded. I have driven by and seen when the patio is full and people are spilling out, and I would probably stay away at those times.  I have read reviews that said basically 'the place is full of hipster douchebags' but that's just bigoted nonsense. Yeah, the place is full of hipsters, but I found the ones I chatted with to be quite nice. Everybody seemed to be having a good time, or studying and smiling.  It's a great place. Loses a star for the poor coffee, and loses another star for that experience I had a few years ago (no Yelp then)",

Two dings: (1) sometimes the staff is standoffish and a little \"too cool\"; and (2) the baked goods are not very good.  I have ordered a brownie, cookie, cake, whatever, countless times and I am always a little disappointed.  If the baked goods were better I'd be here twice as often...then it would be the perfect coffee house/dessert place.",

I went for Happy Hour like I have done at all the others I have visited. Happy Hour menu was not offered.  I had to ask for it.  Then the waiter told me some items on the menu were not available at that location. He said all he had was a \"corporate menu\" which made no sense to me.  Then why give it to a customer?  I asked for a glass of the happy hour wine.  Guess what, that too was not available at that location.  I ordered the chicken with pine nuts and the falafel off the tapas menu. The chicken was awful--very dry and guess what--no pine nuts. Falafel was way overdone.  I sent both back.  I ordered a flatbread which was burned on the bottom.  I was done at that point. The waiter was very apologetic and said they had been having complaints about the happy hour.  He also said there had been lots of complaints about the chicken being dry. There is obviously management issues at this location. I will not be back.  There other locations in town that are much better.",

You have to make a U turn about a quarter mile from the actual entrance to the place.  Their hibiscus tea is my drink of choice and I do rather enjoy their pastries.  I go here quite often to study, but it definitely can be a little bit noisy in here.  There is free wifi and free refills on tea drinks.  I've had their mushroom soup and it was quite delicious.  From what I've been told, their lunch menu items are pretty good.  They also don't mind if you bring outside food when you come.",

There are several rooms and within those rooms, nooks and crannies so you can choose solitude or conviviality, depending on your mood.     The food is A+++++.   All the old favorites are there -- great coffee and melt-in-your-mouth pastries.   I personally have only been there for coffee...yet.    But I heard ooooohs and ahhhhhhs over the rest of the menu items.   You know it's good when people are planning what they will have on their next visit before they have even finished their meal.  There is a bar now and what looks like a very well chosen wine collection.   Enjoy!!!!",
