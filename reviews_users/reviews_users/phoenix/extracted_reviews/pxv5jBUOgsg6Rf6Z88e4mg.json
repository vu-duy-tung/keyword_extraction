They do have a great craft beer selection but almost everything is a 12oz pour ranging in price from $7 to $8.50 which is a bit pricey if you ask me! When we inquired about the wine about half of them weren't in stock. The fish tacos were good but nothing spectular and parking is flat out horribe. The major upside to this place was the sweet patio overlooking Indian School and the quick service. I would definitely trek the 1 mile to OHSO for a beer/ hangout if in the area again.",

There are plenty of great places to hang out at in that neighborhood. I expected this place to be on par with the rest of them. I was not happy with my experience there. I couldn't tell the help from the customers. No one was in any kind of uniform at all.. The crowd seemed very college like (young and immature) the staff seemed the same way. Great for a very very young crowd, but not my cup of Vodka martini. You can keep this place. The food was not worth the money either, I tossed half of it in the trash when the busboy came by to collect our plates. I will not be going back to this place unless they bring it up several notches.",

We waited quite some time for the server to come back.  We needed to ask for utensils because we weren't given any after the food arrived.  It definitely was not busy at the time.

    "text": "My review might be slightly more helpful because I wasn't here on a Wednesday Night for the phenomenal Wednesday Special like almost everybody else was here for.  The menu is very limited and for the most part you are going to order a pizza or a burger and drink wine or one of the many craft brews they feature.  I can't say we had the best burgers out there anywhere because I haven't been everywhere but I can say we had some doozies of very good burgers priced less than Vegas and better than what we had in Las Vegas at one of those specialty burger places.   Ivan Burger $12.00 Hangover Burger $14.00 Most craft brews run an average $8.00 VS. Las Vegas close to $20.00 a Burger  They only have a couple burgers to pick from on the menu and they can be altered slightly. I went with the famous Ivan burger. It is extremely large and is a half pound burger patty with the usual lettuce,tomato,onion, choice of cheese chipotle Mayo on a pretzel bun. It comes with tasty battered fries. My burger was cooked a perfect medium just like I asked for and had a nice crust. It was a very juicy burger but not too much as it didn't fall apart. The pretzel bun was strong enough to support all the weight of the sandwich fillings. It really was a tasty burger.   I think at least half the people out there might think like me and admit the burger is too large. I split the burger in half because I knew that would be plenty. But would have enjoyed it more if it was smaller so it would be easier to manage. For me it was very thick and still delicious but too thick.  My husband tried the Hangover Burger. It's basically an Ivan Burger but with an added egg and he said really good bacon. I don't know how he ate that whole sandwich but he did and said he had to because it was really good.  The Attic is located above a sandwich shop and uses the name Cave and Ives on the outside of the building and on the receipts. The steps are easy to climb but if you are handicapped an elevator is available.  The burgers we had were VERY GOOD! The Pizzas looked good! Lots of craft beers.",

Had to be done.]  Burgers, Holy BeDazzled Wonders of Pretzel Master Pieces. I am in awe of you.   WHY  Wednesday night $10 Burger + Beer deal. My life has been empty before knowing about this sweet deal! You can select ANY divine beer off their selection to match their burger.   But, before I move on to THE IVAN BURGER, let me cover why this neighborhood bar should be yours. (However, I don't want you to come here. Where would I sit? :)  I arrived early to meet friends for a Yelp UYE. (Thanks Jeff E.!) Thirty minutes to kill so I ambled over to the bar. (As a side note: They have an elevator! This is important should you not be frisky in your step. Or, perhaps, may have consumed too much during your time at the bar. Just an fyi. So, FYI!)  THE BAR The staff was super nice and directed me to the bar area, as well as letting me know there was seating available in the outdoor patio area. The outdoor area looks lovely, with a charming fireplace and copious amounts of comfortable looking seating.   I never made it that far. There were some regulars at the bar who stopped me and insisted on helping me up to a bar stool. Before you judge, yes, I'm that short.  Also, I'm using walking sticks. So they were just being super nice. Anyhoo. The next bit will make ANY gal happy: They have purse hooks. WOOT!  In what can only be described as a PRIMO seat I faced Camelback Mtn. Being early has perks. Holy smokes. Watching the sun set is amazing from the bar. The outside patio view is probably killer.   The bar rocked as there were two super nice bartenders spinning their attention out. LOVE them. The regulars rave about the bartenders for a reason, the bartenders are really that great. So are the regulars! I was so surprised to see adult talk amongst \"regulars\". Usually people who spend too much time at a bar, well, scare me.  Not here! I can't wait to go back! These were articulate adults from the immediate neighborhood. A solid conversation crowd. (The guys were discussing the merits of the different beers. Nerds!) The clientele changed slightly I noticed as the night progressed. Younger, but well behaved.   HAPPY HOUR Wowza.  $2 off Bottle Beer $1.5 off Drafts $2 off Appetizers Until 6pm  Subscribe to their Facebook page for other delightful promotions. (I did after my visit. They've got a sense of humor too.)  BEER They've got lots of it. Good stuff. Multiple types of porter. 'nuff said.  THE DINING AREA No reservations, generally four tops which can be put together for larger groups. There's a long table in the back. (That's where we sat. It comfortably accommodates 6. We had about 8. All good.)  Mood lighting is conducive for intimate conversations.  THE BURGER DEAL - Mr. Ivan This fella is huge. You can't split or share him with a friend. You should come hAngry. He's HUGE! Filling and well prepared with your choice of cheese. Tomatoes, onions and chipotle mayo never tasted so delish on a burger...until you tried it on a pretzel bun. Seriously, you've got to try.  I dinged the review a star for the fries. I'm sorry :( (They're stringy and were almost air dry. Like chips.)    Bookmarked for regular visits. Loved it!",

That burger everyone loves so much was on the menu before the attic was the attic.   Anywho... I came on a Wednesday and sat out on the patio in the beautiful weather Phoenix has a tendency to offer its residence this time of year. I peered over the selection of craft beers for something that shouted at me. Yes. A fine selection of funkwerks brews. I chose the deceit and the saison. And both would receive high markings from me on BA and untappd. I also ordered the Ivan burger and fries as part of the running Wednesday special. The fries were fresh and crispy and well seasoned. I love burgers. Love them almost as much as I love my first born. Especially gourmet, prepared medium, and housed by a pretzel bun. You need a good dense piece of bread to support the weight of such a delectable hunk of beef and apparently the attic knows what's up. This burger really is all the rave. Everyone should try it at least once. Peer pressure!   I will most certainly be back. Most certainly for the beer and burger on Wednesday. Also don't forget that you're brews are $1.50 off for HH before 6 every weekday. If I wasn't saving myself for AYCE pad Thai I would be on my way there now!",

The fries, in my humble Idahoan opinion, were cut fresh and seasoned perfectly, the patty was the perfect size and the pretzel bun was maybe the best I've ever had.  Add to that a couple pints of my first Jewish IPA (HeBrew Hop Manna IPA - it was Hasiderific!) and I was completely content.  This was my 1st venture to this area of Phoenix, and I found out there's a bar across the street called The Little Woody?  Sold.  I will be back, and it will most certainly be on a Wednesday!",

The food is delicious and so is the selection of beer sooooo I guess it's all kinda worth it.",

The worst part is we got up and walked out past two servers and they didn't say a word...they could have cared less.

I was really excited for this place and wasn't disappointed on the whole experience, however a few things fell short to bring my rating down a bit. We got the wings to start on top of the burger/beer deal to get our engines starting. I'm a huge fan of wings and if cooked properly with a good sauce can satisfy me the rest of the meal. I asked for my Arcadia Wings to be extra crispy. Unfortunately the wings were not at all. Though tasty and flavorful it didn't have the bite that I asked for. Next were the burgers. We both got the Ivan's and asked for medium. By the time we got them they were  almost well done. A little dry for my taste which makes a burger not a burger. What saved the night was the pretzel bun. If the wings/burger came out as I asked this place would have been epic, but fell short based on those two items. Maybe just a bad night for the staff.",

I don't think we could've picked a better night because every Wednesday is host to the Ivan burger special! Lucky patrons will get one Ivan burger and one craft draft for 10 bucks. Yes, you read that right friends. Maybe you'd be more impressed if you knew just how delicious that Ivan burger is, on a pretzel bun with all of the right fixings and chipotle mayo for a little kick. It truly earns it's distinction as one of the top five all-time burgers (so sayeth the menu). And when I say craft draft, I mean it! These guys have a great and varied rotating selection. And if you want something outside of what they currently have tapped and perhaps something more difficult to come by, feel free to buy a bottle or two from the coolers up front to try with that burger instead. Overall great food and great service at the bar. Definitely prepare yourself for a wait if you are into eating earlier. This place is a bit small and is busy as a happening happy hour spot. I'll be back again in the fall (if not sooner) to take in a brew and the view when the outdoor patio space is once again open.",

    "text": "The food had good flavor and the staff was nice, but the attention to detail and customer service was not all there. I went there around 10pm last night and sat myself at the bar. I waited a while so I could before I even got the bartenders attention. She seemed to be talking to either a friend or to someone who had just gotten off of their shift. I then decided to try to get her attention and finally did. I placed my order with her (I think her name was Sally or Suzzie). She had blonde short hair. I ordered the burger and she didn't ask how I would like it cooked nor did she offer a drink menu or ask me what I wanted to drink- which I found odd especially since she was the bartender. I then saw that there was a beverage menu near me from someone who had already left so I browsed. Then I waited again to try to get my order in because she was talking to the same person. The person she was talking to noticed I was wanting something so told her during their conversation. The bartender made a great IPA suggestion and that's what I got and she gave me water. Then my order came out and it was not on gluten free bread which I had asked when I ordered it. The lady who brought out my food went and got this fixed while I waited again. After my meal was brought out, I noticed I was not given a napkin or utensils. I ended up saying something to the girl who had given me my food and she felt bad and offered to bring me some, but there was an extra set of unused/wrapped up utensils from two seats away from me so I ended up using that (this was my choice). The food server lady was super nice and friendly. The burger was good, but in some areas it was not cooked and was red. I told the lady who had given me my food and she asked if I asked for it cooked a certain way and I told her that was something I was never asked when I placed my order. She then told me that the burgers are normally cooked at medium, but that this should have been mentioned to me. As you can see from my review that everyone was very kind, but the service was just not there. The bartender lady was on her phone texting and looking at Instagram from what it seemed, and it seemed like they were ready for the restaurant/bar to close. It's sad because as a company you just can't forget about the customers that are there in front of you and the experience you are giving them. I chose to go here instead of another restaurant, bummer that the service wasn't there because it could have been a much better experience. I probably won't come back or recommend this place to anyone.",

Just a week ago I was there celebrating my daughter's bday, and it was perfect. I didn't see the owner or mgr there otherwise I would have mentioned it right there.",

The server didn't know what I was ordering off of their Sunday special menu because he \"just got there.\" For how few guests were there, it took quite a bit of time for the food to arrive. The burger tasted decent enough but was spicier than I imagined it would be and the sour I had ordered definitely doesn't pair well with spicy. We tried multiple times to get the server (or any server's) attention so I could order something to wash it down but he didn't make it back to our table for 15 minutes after our food had arrived and we were done eating. There was little acknowledgment when we were headed out after paying, either. Overall, very lackadaisical and underwhelming service.   I won't be back-- I'll spend $40 on a meal somewhere that has personable staff and chilly A/C next time.",

If I'm a vegetarian why would I want a burger that tastes of meat?! I decided on the Caprese, which promised \"hand-pulled mozzarella\". When I got my dish it was not only sour af but the mozzarella was definitely straight Costco cheese. My partner ordered a burger with fries both of which were bland, seasonless and cold. The server wasn't very knowledgable when it came to drinks or anything on the menu for that matter and while the management seemed nice enough I would advise they train their servers better so they can talk about the menu knowledgeably.  I would also advise they change the verbiage and prices on the menu to accurately reflect the (poor) quality of the food. Overall this place is in a great location and good for happy hour but terrible for dinner.",

They have a giant ever-changing selection of beer with excellent prices that includes something for everyone, even wine drinkers like myself.

Bo Bites, it's all good Let's go and make a reservation for two  Yeah, I, I know it's hard to remember The reviews we used to make It's even harder to take a pic That you're here eating next to me  The Attic is located upstairs in ... well the attic - wink.  Actually its just plain upstairs if you want me True opinion.  Came in on a Wednesday happy hour and apparently it's $10 burger and beer night!  Super awesome in my books.    They serve mostly craft brews so I went with the Avery Karma, a pale ale from Boulder, CO.  The ale had a crisp hoppy taste.  For the burger I went with their special, a mushroom and swiss cheese burger.  Overall, it was okay since I didn't really care for mushrooms in general.  The burger was not as juicy as I would like it to be even though I ordered it medium.  The bun was probably my favorite part.  Nice and toasty, but soft in the inside.    Service was okay, except I would appreciate more smile I guess.  In the end, I think I would definitely return to the attic for it's atmosphere.  It had a sports bar lounge ambiance with a classic view. - Enjoy!",

I ordered the Ivan Burger with bacon cooked medium well.  The burger was very tasty and cooked perfectly.  The burger does not come with pickles so make sure you ask for them.  The burger is also served on a pretzel bun which was actually really good.  The fries were decent but you don't get many of them.  The burger and fries were about $12 ($1 more for bacon) and a craft brew will run you about $6.  The bacon was a little too done for my liking but that was the only flaw.  I recommend going during Happy Hour from 3pm-6pm because you can get $2 off an appetizer and $1.50 off of a draft.  Finally, the best day to go is on Wednesday because they have the Ivan Burger, fries, and a craft brew all  for $10 total.  That is almost 50 percent off the regular price.  Check out this place for a great burger!  It's one of the best places in the Valley for a burger and a brew!",

I had been once when it was Caves and Ives and the elements that contributed to its demise are still present: super-loud atmosphere and staffing that is not adequate to give top-notch service.  For a restaurant that was supposed to be out of business, they should take the name off of the side of the building, and don't run the credit cards with the old name on the receipt.  So the good things: 21 beers on tap with a good national selection; as a supporter of locally-crafted beer, I wish they would feature some of the excellent AZ beer being made.  The burger was huge and would easily feed 2 pretty hungry people.  But my medium-well burger was cooked more than the other burgers that were ordered medium, and the \"no mayo\" part of the order was missed on one.  As near as I could tell, there were only 2 waitresses and the bartender (no hostess) waiting on the whole restaurant. And they were literally running back and forth, so while I appreciate their efforts, it's poor form for a well-run restaurant.   The noise level was truly deafening and the vibrations from the air handler on the other side of the wall next to our table were bad enough that I will not be visiting again, but if you don't care about communicating with the folks across the table, go enjoy a potentially great burger and a beer for only $10 on Wednesday night.",

The beer selection seems good, but the couple I tried wasn't impressive.  The burger was a bit greasy and light on the red onion (if the patty's so gigantic why would they just put a shaving of red onion on it??).  The santa fe dry rub wings were a little gross - too much chili powder? - the powder was just too much and not very good.  The chipotle ranch sauce that it comes with was good though and used it for my fries.  The flatbread pizza was too light on the red sauce.  The crust was decent.    The service was SLOOOOOOOW.    This is definitely more of a place to relax and drink than to eat.  The atmosphere and service says as much.  The food doesn't seem to be the focus at all.  Seems like maybe they should put a sign pointing to the front door or something too.",

Although the meats on the meat platter appetizer were tasty, I was expecting a little bit more for $11. Most of the meats were very similar, and there were only two types of cheese, neither of which were that great. I would go back to get a drink and try a different appetizer....but wouldn't be my first choice for a burger. With that said, I did like the place, staff was friendly and food was good, just nothing special.",

    "text": "This place has been on my list for about 7 months.  Due to their hours and location I just haven't been able to get over here until now.  The Attic is a great spot on the south side of Indian School and 44th St.  It seats around 30 people I would estimate.  Great patio looking directly at Camelback mountain.    We ordered the meat platter, a pretzel with hot mustard, and the Ivan burger.  The meat platter for two was huge and consisted of prosciutto, cappicola, salami, red bell peppers, pickles, crackers, bread, and cheese.  It was pretty good.  I would have liked some olives and figs to add some sour and sweet to the plate.  The hot pretzel came out fresh and to our surprise it was Asian hot mustard not regular mustard.  The Ivan burger was very big with a huge pretzel bun.  It was very very good.  Fresh, juicy, and good toppings.  I cant say its the best burger Ive had in AZ but I would never turn it down that's for sure.  This was enough food for three people to share and still be full.  The beer selection was the highlight for me.  21 beers on tap and no BS domestic listed.  This is how its done future restaurateurs.  Take notes.  I enjoyed a Stone enjoy by and it was outstanding.  I am looking forward to coming back again and trying out some other items and taps.  Wish they opened earlier during the week for lunch and Id be back sooner.  It would have been 5 stars if not for a few issues: valet parking is not convenient when the parking lot is so close by, our beer menu was filthy, the waitress didn't fill up our drinks the entire time and it took a while for our food, not a full bar service.",

I had several craft brews, got a spectacular view of Camelback Mountain at sunset, and got to eat someone's leftover half-burger.  No I'm not homeless. What the fuck?  It's just that this old dude ordered a burger split. When it arrived, the chick he was scamming on was all...      \"Who's that for? I don't eat read meat! Do I look like I eat red meat?\"  Yeah, yeah, yeah. Sit down and shut the fuck up I'm thinking to myself as this haughty little ingenue delivered a scene reminiscent of Scarlet 'fucking' O'hara in Gone With The WInd, her every word punctuated and overacted.  After her performance, she hastily stormed out. That's when I nudged the guy and asked if he was gonna eat that.  Anyways, I got a great craft buzz, ate a good half burger, and made it down the staircase without getting all knotted-up.   All things considered, this was a five star in my book.",

The Grind is my other favorite spot but definitely more creative menu options and 20+ beers on tap here. The Attic is famous for the Ivan which is not bad at all after it got ranked top ten in the world by a legit burger afficionado guy. Yet my favorite is the Holmburger and it's Crack sauce. Yes Crack sauce is my favorite. All burgers are on a pretzel bundle which is made at the bakery downstairs (Sacks) Most burgers are $10-15 prepared to your level of pink and come with a choice of sides fries side salad and maybe something else? I usually get the wings as appetizers. The house wings crispy areare my favorite. Not a huge fan of the dry rub version(forget flavor name) Thursday tends to be a a featured burger day. They have appetizers and entrees that they rotate (listed on bottom of weekly beer list also weekend brunch stuff they rotate. There was an old manager named Ryan who really brought all this together and totally passionate about food and beer as well. He's no longer there but still plenty of quality staggy that have been there a while. Tiffany is one of the bartenders that is usually there always peppy friendly and honest. I've never had any service issues so don't that random article from a while back on azcentral 3tv or whatever keep you from checking out this spot.",

There are several good locals that would probably benefit from being on tap in a place like this. The craft beer industry is a small industry and needs to grow. Only through local support will this happen. Everywhere in the east coast and west coast there are specialty burger places that serve local crafts, and sometimes exclusively local. I wish I had seen the same here. Great potential to tap into this emerging market yet it is unrealized.  Aside from that the burger was excellent and the fries were \"meh\".

    "text": "The Attic is the new name for Cave & Ives. It's been taken over by new owner (who happens to be very familiar with Cave & Ives), but all the elements we loved about Cave & Ives are still intact. The official grand opening for The Attic is in August, but they are in fact open now!  We were so bummed when Cave & Ives closed in April. It was our favorite restaurant in the valley. We used to drive 40 minute to get there at least once a week. When we heard that Cave & Ives was reopening under a new concept and new name, we were hesitant to go back. We didn't want to ruin the fond memories we had of Cave & Ives. Now we kick ourselves and say, \"Why have we not been back sooner!\"  As soon as we walk through the door, we were greeted with familiar faces and some very pleasant surprises. Ryan, the bartender that we loved for his great service and beer knowledge, was still there. In fact, they added more taps and now serve even more varieties of beers than before. They no longer have the large selection of bottled beers, but their draft beer selection was, and is still, very impressive. If you don't know what to drink, ask Ryan. He will not steer you wrong. In fact, we often choose to sit at the bar because Ryan is there.   We were ecstatic to see that the menu hasn't changed too much either. The burger is still being served and all the pizzas are still the same. If you go to The Attic for the first time, YOU MUST ORDER THE BURGER!!! Ryan just informed us tonight that their burger was named one of the top 10 burgers in the United States! The Burger is a grill 1/2 lb. patty topped with grilled onions, chipotle mayo, spring greens, on a pretzel bun with your choice of cheese, and a side of French fries. If you can, order the bacon, sauteed mushrooms, and blue cheese.  You can also order The Hangover Burger, which is the burger with a fried egg and bacon strips. If you're into spice, ask the server for Da Bomb. They keep it behind the bar. Our second favorite item on the menu (by a very close second) is the steak salad. They didn't have it this time, but Ryan assures us that the steak salad will also be coming back soon.  We were so happy that the experience of going to The Attic has not diminished our memories of Cave & Ives. The new decor with darker walls and pops colorful art is a plus. The music choices and more relaxed atmosphere made the place better. We also discovered that they added a burger challenge to the menu. Each challenger will need to each more than the last challenger (1 more patty, 1 more egg, 2 more strips of bacon). The winner gets to rename the burger and get their picture up on the wall. My husband is psyching himself up to doing the challenge on Tuesday!   The Attic might be a different name, but same location, great service, delicious food, and excellent beer selection.",

The only things to watch out for: The patio is deserted in the summer.  I wish it could be covered more or have some more misters.  Because of that, it can get pretty crowded inside.  I bet when it's not the summer the patio is great though.  I've heard parking can be a pain, but I didn't experience that when I was there.

Two...don't let \"friends\" hang out and dominate the scene every damn day. Allow good paying guests to enjoy the atmosphere without your \"buddies\" bringing in outside beer and homemade lemonchello to show off. Save that for private. This is a business first.

    "text": "I used to frequent this place quite often with over 100 check-ins on Untappd just from stopping by over the course of a year for a beer or two after work or just a place to have a good burger (highly recommend the Holmburger!) and catch up with friends. The beer selection is great and usually changes often which is very welcomed!   Unfortunately the past few times I've been there the service has really dropped down where I am barely being waited on and servers only stop by to take orders or drop off food. Last time I only had one beer, not because I only wanted one, but the server never stopped by even though we had  empty beer glasses on the table. It wasn't even a busy night...  The worst part now is that even though they have a great beer selection with many uncommon beers, you are now CHARGED FOR A SMALL SAMPLE! I sometimes like to try a small taste before I commit to a large glass, now I'm charged for both! When you have 30+ beers, it's nice to sample one or two first before deciding on one... Horrible policy which is driving away myself and others I have talked to there. We had a good run over the past year, sadly I won't be back...",

They seated us outside on the patio which was beautiful! It wasn't crowded at all, and the noise level was perfect!   We ordered wine, and several different appetizers! Let me start with, they were delicious!!! We had wings, a pretzel, bruschetta, and caprese! My favorite was definitely bruschetta (but if you were to ask my stomach it would argue that the wings were favorite), the flavor of the Brie was so good! I found one of my new favorite happy hour places!   I also saw in the menu that they are known for their burgers,\" I WILL BE BACK \"(say it like you're Arnold in the terminator)! Hehehe.   Honestly, what made this experience for me was not only how awesome the atmosphere and food were but how fabulous the staff was! They spoke with you on a personal level, they even took Brittany C.'s and I yelp tags and wore them around the bar! Classic. Thanks for such a great ending to our girls night out!",

I ordered the Margherita Pizza & it's one of the best I've ever had. My other favorite Margherita pizza place is LGO & I still like their sourdough crust the best, but the toppings on the pizza here blow LGO out of the water in my opinion.

Near the fireplace outside would have been a great place to have dinner except the weather was just a little too cold for me. There was a large party out there enjoying themselves though.   I ordered The Ivan, hold the cheese, please. According to the menu, it is one of the top 5 burgers in the world, and I don't disagree (although I haven't had all the burgers in the world, yet). I made a New Year's resolution not to eat another pretzel bun, but since it was still 2015, I figured why not. Add avocado too, and bring it on with fries. I'll start that healthy eating in 2016. I wanted the full meal deal and paired it with a cider. Glad I did!",

Overall, it was also a little more on the pricy side for burgers, but definitely worth the flavor and size!!!",

We ordered drinks and wings for an appetizer and didn't see our server again until our main food order came out. Our drinks sat empty until we had to ask the person that ran our food to find our server for us. Then once we received those drinks, we finished eating and drank the drinks. We had to ask two different people to send our server over with the bill. We had the Ivan burger and a mushroom and sausage pizza. Both were amazing which is why this place deserves the three stars. The lack of service really ruined the experience. We have decided that we'd go back because the food was so good, but we'll sit at the bar next time and not take our chances with the service.",

My boyfriend and I had come in with a couple of our close friends to show them how truly amazing these burgers are.  3 of us had ordered the special burger of the night \"da bears\" which I wish they would keep on the menu. But anyways when we all had ordered the beer that you could get without getting charged extr (they have little peppermint patties) next to them I feel like is a waste of ink on their menus since the waitress charged us full price for the beers and just subtracted 3 dollars from each when we did not order the other beers on purpose because we wanted the 12-14 dollar deal that comes with a burger and beer for the above listed price that you are told won't change if you get the appropriate (peppermint patty dotted) beers.   With that being said I'm not sure how often my boyfriend and I will be back since we are not a huge fan of places changing their prices and not being a good deal. I guess good things can never last right?",

I've watched over the past year (from living in the neighborhood) the snowball effect of more and more 'regulars' and more and more smiles in the restaurant.   My opinion is 3 simple things will bring you back to an establishment: 1)  Good Service 2)  Good Food & Drink 3)  A memorable, positive experience each time you're there My wife and I continue to be impressed each and every time we go in.  Frankly, they are really finding their rhythm with an unmatched and constantly revolving beer taps, a food menu that is diverse and centered around quality and an ambiance with their patio/TVs, and bar area that is very intriguing and compelling to stick around.   Bottom line:  It's a craft beer place - first and foremost.  There are At LEAST 20 different beers you'll likely NOT find anywhere else.  If you're OK with traditional beers at traditional sports bars, taverns or medium priced restaurants - that's OK, because their knowledgeable staff will guide you to what you're palate is thirsting for.  My wife likes wine - and they can help you with that, too.  The food menu provides a good range of 'comfort', 'healthy' and 'unique' - but all fresh and the utmost quality. My personal favorites:  Taco Tuesday, Burger Night Wednesday and Sunday (at 10AM) for their unbelievable breakfast choices!  Seriously - where are you going to find that diversity at ANY other craft beer restaurant!?   Ultimately, you'll need to give it a try for yourself - leave it up to them to prove to you like they did my wife and I - that you'll want to go back!",

I had the ginger cider which was good. We started with the arcadia attic wings. They were a little sweet with a spicy kick on the end.  Good but next time we will try the buffalo wings. My husband had The Ivan burger and I had the Hangover burger. Both on pretzel buns and chipotle mayo. The patties were juicy and cooked to perfection   And savory.

Nice selection of craft beers, including some relatively rare finds.  The not-so-good: indifferent service from the only server working the room. A manager asked if our drink orders had been taken (they had) as he noticed that we had nothing but water after we had been seated for quite some time.  Fries came cold, as if they had been cooked well before the burger.  Two burgers/two beers with tip was over $40.  Not worth the $ when paired with poor service. I would only consider a return on a Wednesday when burger/beer combo is offered for $10.",

One where we were not committed to buying a ticket for a lame table full of appetizers and the promise of cheap champagne at midnight.  We arrived here just after 6. The area around the bar was full, it was in the low 50s-mid 40s, so a little chilly to be on the patio even if there was a fire and a couple of heaters.  We chose a high-top next to the bar.   This was perfect.  Very casual and relaxed environment. Good for a first date, a night out with friends or even dinner with the family.    They have a nice rotating selection of craft beers on tap and in the bottle.  Food wise they offered a daily special (Cioppino on the night we were there) and are known for their burgers.  We wanted a little something to wet the appetite so we ordered a few wings (Louisiana wings, a little salty even for my salty palate, like they reduced some Franks RedHot a little too much but still edible).  We also shared a pizza.  It was very good and agreed that we needed to come back to try the infamous burger and to enjoy a warm winter sunset on their patio.",

I came with my boyfriend (whom is a kitchen manager at another similarly themed craft beer & burger restaurant) on a seemingly slow night. We were excited to try this spot! There were only 6 other tables at the time we arrived so we anticipated a fast & accurate experience. Well, it was anything BUT fast or accurate. It took over an hour for two burgers & fries, & when it did come out, it was the wrong order all together. There was not one thing that we ordered (other than fries) that actually came out to us. And the server provided no reconciliation for the wait time or the wrong food, she honestly tried to displace the blame on us for \"asking so many questions about the menu\" that we confused her. I'm sorry, it's our first visit!!! This place isn't welcoming AT ALL & the servers walk around like are completely annoyed 24/7. We didn't even eat our food, other than a few of the cold French fries that came out with our wrong burgers. This place may have had good food at one time, but now they are just arrogant & lazy about their product. Like other reviews say, the market is overly saturated with burger joints nowadays so I'll gladly take my time & money to an establishment that actually appreciates their patrons. This place is laughable.",

The Happy Hour specials were decent and I was pleased with the selection that they have for drinks. Our server was friendly and attentive. I'm excited to come back and try more food.

He knows how much I love burgers so he took me on Wednesday for the burger and a beer special. I was almost going to stay home because I was exhausted but I am glad I went. It is a small space but cute at the same time. While I was looking at the menu I saw that their burgers were in the top10 in the world. That got me excited to try it. The beer selection was very different because they were beers that are not as popular to the area but I found one that was really good. Then... my burger came out. Holy cow, literally! It came out in a pretzel bun with fries. I had to strategize how I was going to eat it because it was so big. Once I took my first bite, I was in heaven. Burgers are one of my favorites so you can imagine that I was enjoying every bite. It just melted in my mouth. I am making my mouth water right now just writing about it. Anyway, great place and I will definitely be back.",

But the patty wasn't hot, it was slightly warm so that was a minus but still very delicious. The side salad was so good! They make their own ranch, best ranch I've ever had. They have a special I guess Wednesday's Friday's and Saturdays but our waitress failed to tell us that before we ordered which I would have liked to know.. But very good.

The only downside is it is a bit of a drive from my residence. My favorite item would be the Ivan burger, it's a substantial and tasty burger. On a side note I went to their Boulevard Brewery event last night as I saw they would be serving Kansas City style barbecue. I had the brisket sandwich with potato salad and mac and cheese, that was some of the best barbecue I've had! The brisket was well cooked with great taste and consistency. Hopefully they make barbecue a regular part of the menu at some point in the future. I am a fan of the Attic and I enjoy being a customer!",

    "text": "First off, let me say that I am a young, 5'10\" moderately fit male who CrossFits only 2-3 times per week and occasionally eats vegetarian. My friend brought me to the Ale House for a burger on a Thursday night after a dust storm. It was a late dinner, but don't get me wrong I am an early bird. Admittedly, I was not used to the pacific time zone. I do think coffee helps me to get going early in the mornings (both my brain and my colon), but no more than a half of a cup before my GERD really flares up. A doctor recommended Tums but then I sometimes get constipated which interrupts my early morning CrossFit schedule. After climbing the stairs to the Attic Ale House we were caught off-guard by the HORROR that had unfolded in front of us. The front of the restaurant reminded me of a warzone left for us to piece together the backstory. It appeared a patron had emptied their stomach and guts in a projectile fashion onto the doorstep of the restaurant. I could only imagine that the restaurant cast a curse so damning that he or she was able to make it only to the doorstep of the restaurant before being condemned to the most gruesome thing I've seen since Saving Private Ryan. As we tippy-toed by in disbelief we hadn't processed what we had witnessed until we were inside the restaurant. Most people would have left right there. For whatever reason we were drawn in further, ravenous zombies determined to find food. Maybe our subconscious could foretell the meal that was coming our way. Maybe we were scarred from the sight and couldn't dare to pass by it again. We didn't turn back. We wandered like shell-shocked soldiers to the bar and sat down. I ordered the Amber Ale and the HOLMBURGER with sriracha crack sauce. What I later devoured that night was the BEST BURGER I've had since my short time here on this planet. And I'm a cheating vegetarian mind you! The crack sauce lives up to the name, making this the best burger I can remember. HIGHLY RECOMMEND, 5/5! I rarely still lose sleep at night and wake up vividly remembering what I saw on doorstep, but would definitely go back when I am in town again The Holmburger with Crack Sauce was well worth the experience. Well done Ale House!",

    "text": "The Attic has 24 of the best craft beers you've never heard of.  I consider myself pretty knowledgeable about beer, but this place reminded me that there are so many good beers out there that I've never tried.  A must try for the craft beer lover.  Our server told us that the beer menu changes daily.  I believe it, because the paper beer menu on our table had a slightly different list of beers than the two dozen or so written on the chalkboard on the wall.  The Attic does a good job of describing its cornucopia of malty offerings - giving the origin of the beer, the bitterness units and the % alcohol.  There is an early afternoon happy hour that is great if you want to catch a football game on a Saturday or Sunday.    Oh yeah, and the food was pretty good too.  I enjoyed the cheese platter, which had a good sampling of fruits, nuts and artisan cheeses.  The gorgonzola and apple salad was phenomenal and full of flavor.  I didn't have one of the cheeseburgers, but they looked pretty juicy.  Did I mention they have a rooftop patio?  The whole bar and restaurant is on the second floor.  Tha patio faces north, away from the sun, and was a pleasant place to sit on a nice fall day.   The only complaint I had was the service.  It was friendly, but glacially slow.  It's fine if you plan to spend an afternoon meandering your way through the beer menu, but if you're hungry you might be annoyed by the long wait for your food.  To be fair, we were a large party, but on the other hand the bar wasn't THAT busy.  Overall, though, worth checking out!",

I ordered the Ivan Burger and a craft beer for $12 and my partner only ordered the beer I had. The portion was big but the burger was bland so I boxed my half burger and salad. The cost for my burger and beer was $12 but my partner beer was $7.50.  Again, he had the same beer I did...that's way overpriced. Can't say we will be back any time soon.",

Explosion of unique flavors such as Sriracha candied pancetta and something they call \"food crack sauce\" I've only been here twice and will most def be back.   P.S. they have burgers available any night and many beer pairing to go along with the already good food.",

We arrived there at 5:13pm and sat down at a table in the bar area. As I was viewing the menu to order a glass of wine, there wasn't much of a choice, but I got a glass of the Pino Grigio since I love wine so much. As we waited for my glass of wine, a conversation about baby veil started to take place around the bar. There were 3 gentlemen that started to talk about how awesome baby veil tasted. They went into great detail on how the animal is to be taken away from its mother, have its legs crushed so it can not walk, and put into a sealed container where the baby cow eats little to nothing while all of its muscle is eaten by its starving body. Not only did this conversation start and continue for the next 3 minutes loudly, but the bartender was also involved in the laughing discussion on how baby cows are mistreated to provide human consumption. I then asked for my check and let the bartender know that I was deeply disturbed by the conversation being taken place around the bar. She said nothing to me, and brought me my check right away. The conversation continued as my fiance paid our bill and we left the establishment. We will never step foot into this establishment ever again. The thought will remain and shame on the staff to allow such conversation to take place and continue in a public environment.",

Since it was a Wednesday, they have a special for their burgers and beers. I decided to order the hangover burger which comes with an over easy egg. I was pleased with my selection because the burger had quality ingredients such as a pretzel bun. \"The bite\" for this burger was rather large but I was able to make it happen, lol. I absolutely love their fries because they remind me of pommees frites. I loved them so much I almost wanted to ask for another order, but stopped myself because I was extremely full.

Parking can be a challenge, but once you've snagged a spot head upstairs to check this place out. The service isn't exactly overly friendly or attentive, but the wait is worth it. Take a seat, figure out what kind of drink you want (they have plenty to choose from), and check out the menu. I highly recommend a burger medium rare on a pretzel bun...holy smokes it is delicious! The fries are top notch as well. Some other good options that I have found yummy are the caesar salad, pretzel app with cheese sauce, and the pizza. My only knock on the food is that if you do not order your burger medium rare or rare they tend to come out like hockey pucks, and no one wants one of those burgers.   The Attic is a fantastic place to grab some food, drinks, chill and watch a game. The view is spectacular and the environment is relaxing and pleasant. Don't expect to be in and out quick cause the service isn't swift, but like I said before it is worth the wait.",

    "text": "Gastropub to me implies diverse selection of food...This place misses that mark.  Pros: good service, decent selection of craft beers, ample TV's to watch the games.  Cons: the menu selection is extremely limited, you have a choice between hamburgers, pizza or salad, that is it. We were dissapointed the menu offering was so narrow and when the food arrived it was average. You would think for only having basically 2 products on your menu it would blow your socks off. Also it is an open air concept so both inside and outside (of course) is exposed to the outdoor temperatures which in the winter/cooler months it gets real chilly inside without a jacket.",

The Hangover is also amazing. It has saved me many Saturday mornings! The egg and bacon is cooked to perfection.  You may think the food is my favorite part of the Attic Ale House. Wrong! You need to see this beer list to believe it. They have all the local favorites, but also rotating crafts from all over the country. The list changes daily and there is always something for everyone.  I will definitely be back. The patio is too good to resist!",

I went there on Saturday evening and there was only one cook and the burger showed because of it. The bun was the only good thing, I also paid a dollar more for the grass fed beef, couldn't tell the difference.  Service was slow and if the burger was built up to what \"they\" say it was then a slow service would have been forgiven. After reading the name \"the attic ale house\". Well that should have said it all.",

My husband got a burger and I got fish tacos. The tacos were okay - fresh but not very flavorful. My husband loved his burger, it was nice and juicy. I think we missed out on ambiance of this place as I didn't even see what the whole restaurant and deck looked like because we were right next to the entrance. Honestly they shouldn't even have a table there as I don't know who would enjoy that spot.",

I had their Ivan burger which was delicious, but HUGE.  Beyond that, I had downed beers the rest of the night and had a good time. I must say that I wasn't overly crazy about the service. The bartender while reasonably efficient and polite wasn't the warmest or friendliest. It was pretty busy so I definitely take that into account but her attitude was noticeably contrary to the overall warmth and cheer of the place and the patrons which was disappointing.

My first impression was that this is a little oddly shaped establishment, but I have a feeling that there are some regulars here. Dipsomaniacs in need of social interaction, aren't we all at times?  The Beer diversity and level of interest The beers are interesting, but the diversity is skewed. I still liked it though, but two of the beers I wanted to try, they were out of. That quite a lot on a list that contains 12 beers. I want more beers on the list!   The Service There is a cute blond behind the bar, and she is working perpetually. She has no need to check in on you and your needs to quench your thirst, so if you want her attention you need to speak up, flag her down. She was clearly unimpressed by the jokes from the peanut gallery, disregarding if it was an homage to her beauty or a annoying applause as she accidentally displaced glassware into the bar or the floor. I cannot imagine working where people stare at me all day. It would be like working in an aquarium - if we disregard the humidity. In regards to the knowledge of the beers, I didn't feel that I was dealing with a brew pundit.   Conclusion I did enjoy this place, and time just went extraordinarily fast in here. They do have a rotation and will be getting even more interesting beers on the menu, and that will be very nice to experience. But if I wouldn't already known anyone here, I don't feel the atmosphere is such as I would strike up a conversation with strangers in my lonesomeness.",

Four businesses....no \"The Attic\"....until we realized, the name was not just cute and memorable---it's the location. Going through the iron gates, we climbed the stairs and found this cool spot. It's not very big and that patio isn't being used due to work being done outside, but this place was full.        They offered a limited Sunday menu that boasted chicken wings and salads but most of all...The Ivan Burger. A massive amount of meat cooked to perfection, topped with the works (you can add Bacon and mushrooms as well) along with a chipotle mayo that got my tastebuds a goin'. If that doesn't make your mouth water the pretzel bun will. This burger is straightforward and a hunk of heaven.          Naturally I can't eat a burger without a brew to wash it down with. The Epic Sour Apple beer I picked was great. It had tangy, sour hints while not tasting too sweet like a cider. It was so good that the guy I was with liked it more than his more \"manly\" beer. I hold the title for fruit beer success.        All in all, I want to get back up to the Attic to see what they have in store on their regular menu, what a good hide away!!",

    "text": "Wowzers, now this is an awesome gastropub. No ifs ands or buts about it, they have probably the best burger I have ever tasted here, ready for your enjoyment...  ~Fud/Drink~ \"The Burger\", as they call it on their menu, is one of the best burgers in the world...its ranked. Yep, I know. I am not a big burger person, especially in the latter part of my young life. I am much more content with a fish or chicken dish than a greasy burger. But I must say I will gladly cross the line drawn in the sand for this burger. Upon picking up an already half eaten burger, I immediately noticed the weight and density. I was floored. It is impressively heavy, packed with yummy mixed greens, shaved red onion and the choice cheese tonight being provolone. The chipotle mayo is sublime, mixing the beef together along with the pretzel bun. Overall, this definitely constitutes the afformentioned ranking...its damn good.  Plus we enjoyed the burger and beer $10 special which they offer Wednesdays. The entire tab including my lone beer I ordered on the side would have come out to over $28, however the special shaved off $2 from the burger and an additional $6+  on our bill....IMPRESSIVE! This deal is on par with other nightly specials in the area... I fail to mention the fact that the beer selection is very good, they offer enough lighter varieties for me to try, but they offer something for every beer drinker.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ Inside it may seem a bit cramped, but its not...the layout is quaint and you are surrounded by fun sings and album covers of indy bands. They have a few TV's with sports on, and the patio also provides a couple TV's as well. It is darker inside than a normal food spot, which lends to The Attics trademark chill vibe. Waitress was average in speed of service, nothing to write home about. I had no real questions to ask...next time I will pick their brains more. Awesome hangout bar, really relaxed atmosphere, once again.  ~Extras/Rating~ Wednesday...$10...Beer....Burger....Special... JUST DO IT!  They get 5 stars. Why? Well, they have an amazing selection of crafts, an intimate setting and atmosphere, insanely tasty food, and heck, the best burger-beer deal in town..I mean, its the best burger and some of the best beer...IN TOWN, lol! Its a no-brainer. Bank it! Shoo-wop!",

The new place is definitely a pub like experience mostly because of the menu.  They added a ton of TV's which was kind of fun, but the vibe still points towards a classier joint. They still have a great beer and wine selection and the decor is awesome...but again, and maybe I'm confused...its a pub!   We ordered wings and the cheese plate to start. The wings were fantastic, so was the cheese plate but here is what makes me laugh, the cheese plate looks like it was plated by a pub but tastes like it belongs in a wine bar. It was cubed artesian cheeses that were all delicious, with great sides of nuts, fruits, olives etc.  I ordered the Margarita pizza and boyfriend had the breakfast burger, which was HUGE but good.   I think I am just confused on what direction this place is going towards, menus and beers say pub, wine, cheese and decor say more of a wine bar with a little sass.  Needless to say, for the wings and beer alone, we will go back.",

Although I'm not super impressed with their pretzel on the app menu, their bruschetta is delicious and so are their pizzas and burgers. They often have specials (i.e., special price for a beer and burger, or beer and pizza, etc) and they're totally worth it. It's a fun atmosphere with a patio that overlooks Camelback. It has a ton of TVs if you're also looking for a fun place to watch a game (without having to go to a huge place). It can get pretty crowded during big games though, so plan accordingly.",

Most places with a good burger use the bun as the thing to hold the meat; The Attic's pretzel bun is so delicious you could eat it by itself.

    "text": "I had been hearing about this place for a couple months now. I finally got the chance to go today and see what the buzz was about.  The menu isn't too large; it's comprised mainly of pizza and burgers, appetizers, and a few salads. I heard the burgers were good so I decided to go with The Holmberg - pepper jack, strips of fresh jalapenos (I love fresh jalapenos - nice touch), candied prosciutto,  sriracha, spring mix, onion, tomato,  topped off with \"crack sauce\" (still not exactly sure what it is), on a pretzel bun. Well...all I can say is amaaazing! Truly one of the best burgers I've ever had. I'm not sure if it was the candied bacon or the crack sauce or a combo of the two but it had this sweet syrupy taste to it which may sound weird but man does it work. It was so good. My compatriots who tried it agreed that it was delicious. My friend had the hangover burger and said it was pretty darn good. My other friend had what I believe was called the Sicilian pizza. I tried a sample and it was pretty good.   I also had two, yes two, glasses of Moscato. Mmm a burger and Moscato...don't judge me it was a good combo! Pretty decent Moscato. My friend had a couple different IPA's...I think they have different ones every day or every week? I'm not a beer drinker so I can't remember what the waitress said.   The only real complaint was the price...it's a tad pricey. I think both the burgers were $14. The pizza was $15, the Moscato was $8 a glass. That's pricey for burgers and in such a casual atmosphere but the burger is so good I'd come back and pay It again when I'm really craving a good burger, but It will keep me from going often. On Wednesdays though they have a pretty good special - The Ivan burger plus a beer for $10 if that's your thing (beer...Bleah lol).   Overall, the food is great so I'd recommend this place and I will go back in the future.",

Service was good, our waitress was happy to climb on the table to turn down our fan when we got a little chilly.  She was very genuine with her opinions of the menu and was very excited about her favorites, so we felt confident when we placed our orders.    I had the Ivan burger because I keep hearing great things about it and the menu boasted some kind of \"top burger\" award.  It was good, for sure.  But I wouldn't put it at number one. Top 10 maybe.  It had all the traditional toppings, including a chipotle aioli that wasn't too spicy for the likes of me.  The beef was tender and cooked just right.  I took half home, and it warmed up the next day to almost the same quality it originally was... that's the mark of a good burger!  The happy hour is pretty good with discounted beer (long list of options), wine, and appetizers.  The Attic isn't really in my neighborhood so I don't think I'll be a regular, but I wouldn't say no to a return trip!",

The young guy walked away without placing us on a list and after several minutes he asked if we were ok and still didn't place us on a list or let us know how long the wait was. Too many good places to eat to put up with this type of attention. As we walked out they could care less about losing business.

Daily specials in addition to the extensive menu of salads,  burgers and delicious pizza.  Portions are very generous.   If you are a beer or cider person this place is a MUST.  Extensive list of taps and bottled beer, not your avergar run of the mill stuff.    When the weather is tolerable, there is a great patio to enjoy views of Camelback from 2 stories up.   Also apparently there is a Sunday brunch !?  Had no clue but saw the menu.  Definitely need to try it out.",

Although, I just went here for dinner with my boyfriend, that's the vibe I go from this place: somewhere friends and families can come together to relax and enjoy a meal and drinks. While being here I saw a variety of \"customer types\". There was a few guys on the outside patio watching a golf game and drinking some beers, there was a group of friends having dinner and drinks, and there was a family also having dinner. I really wish I would've tried a burger because I feel like that's what they're known for, but we got the Two Brothers pizza and the traditional buffalo wings. Neither of these disappointed. I don't know how to word this other than the pizza had the perfect thickness. It wasn't overly doughy to the point where all you taste is bread and it wasn't too than to the point the bread is brittle and breaks off easily before you bite into it. The wings were just for my boyfriend and he liked them. I'm the foodie in the relationship and he rarely has a significant opinion about restaurants, but at the end of our dinner he said \"I'd be open to coming back to this place.\"  We live right down the street and plan on coming back for random weekday date nights.",

The restaurant is located upstairs on the 2nd floor and has both inside and outdoor seating. The outside patio is big with an outside bar, tvs, couches and tables. Some of the seating is right on edge so you can overlook from the balcony which is really cool.   The staff was awesome!!!! We had a lot of fun talking with them and the service was great.  We sat outside in one of the lounge couches and relaxed while enjoying some wine and appetizers. We ordered the bruschetta, caprese, dry rub wings, and pretzel. All of it was super good and filling between the 3 of us. The bruschetta was desert like and delicious. I also loved the pretzel dipped in the cheese sauce.  Overall everything was super good and I'm looking forward to coming back! I highly recommend. Would be a great place for happy hour or to watch a sports game!",

    "text": "This place, to me, is always so tempting and sounds good all the time. Except, unfortunately often times is unsatisfying. First off, I will say I love/hate their best selections. They constantly change up their beers which is awesome, but don't dare fall in love with one too hard, for it may not be there during your next visit. Its definitely their thing, but just something to think about if you're one to stick to comfort or familiarity. Whats awesome though is they now have a full bar, so liquor is a go! Their dry rub wings are amazing, super flavorful and juicy. Pizza is decent if you were to compare them to places specializing in pizza. Now to their burgers, a hit or miss. Sometimes there's too much, sometimes it seems lackluster, or sometimes depending on who takes your order, you're not able to order it medium rare (been told a few times that they can try to note in the instructions for chef to cook medium rare, however itll be closer to medium). Then other nights I ask for medium rare and it comes out perfectly. Last thing I do want to mention is service is not as consistent as one would like or expect from an establishment that's been around for a good bit, especially for a place smack dab in Arcadia. I remember one night my table waited 20 minutes to get the check after politely asking for it. Another 15 for server to come back to collect payment. And I can definitely understand how it would be frustrating to split checks but it's a very common request nowadays and other places have seemed to accommodate and adapt. She came back (we were a party of 8 and split the tab 5 ways) and provided us 1 pen. All things aside though, you can't beat the vibe/ambiance, the now (just became open bar, plus they've always had a decent wine selection)  drink options available, the view of Camelback, and upstairs patio on a beautiful fall evening.",

But what is really what makes me give this place one star is the fact that they think it is acceptable to not run their AC in the dead of Summer in AZ. We spoke to multiple waitresses and they explained that the manager was cheap. The tables on both sides of us also complained about the heat. We had a hard time deciding if it was hotter inside or outside and it was 93 degrees that evening. This alone made it impossible for any of us to enjoy or dining experience and one glass of water every thirty minutes is ridiculous.",

The Attic has the best burger in the greater Phoenix area that I've had.  Close in regards to other great burger spots in the area, but what set the Attic apart was a fine attention to detail in patty flavor, consistency, and freshness and less about adding flare to cover up a bland patty. It was juicy, buttery, meaty, and had the perfect consistency for a medium well patty.  The craft beer selection (unlike the other \"craft beer bars\" in the area) had balls and didn't focus on the general low ABV wheat beers with fruit added that Phoenix is known for.  Complete with bold selections from a triple IPA from Founders brewery and an Horchata Imperial stout from Elevation, the Attic has 21 taps filled with rarities and craft-tastic options.   The Attic is a must if you enjoy great food and craft beer.  Go there immediately.",

I am pleased to report my expectations were met, and exceeded, in every aspect from the diversity of craft beer on tap, to the quality of food, to the manner of service.  Cheryl was our waitress, and I couldn't be more happy with her service; she was friendly and responsive to our table of 8, including having amazing beer floats made for us, in order to celebrate my birthday, which were *not* menu items!  The Ivan was a fantastic burger: large, and delicious. If you are a fan of sours you may be interested to know they had both New Belgium's La Folie and Anderson Valley's Blood Orange Gose on tap, two of my favorites!  I'd strongly suggest going with one of the burgers, instead of the pizza. A couple of people in my party ordered pizza, which they said was average, while everyone else who ordered a burger thought it was way above average.",

I was really in the mood for a beer, but their beers we're primarily the heaviest, most high alcohol choices possible. I'm all about a nice craft brew, but most times I got stuff to do after I drink a couple pints. I dont want to be feeling like a comatose glutton after my food & drink. There needs to be some variety in their beer menu.   The burger i got here was average, I didnt end up getting a beer since I wasnt in a mood for a heavy 8% abv brew, and the service was forgettable.

Every time we needed the waiter it took at least 15 minutes to wave him down, and he really didn't come over unless we made a very pointed attempt to get him to come over. Even after simply asking for a drink menu it took him a solid 10 minutes to bring it. We went with 90 minutes before we needed to leave and towards the end we felt like we were cutting it close and had to rush. The restaurant wasn't crowded at all when we arrived, so that wasn't the root of the problem.  The burgers were really big, and perfectly fine. But I'm not really positive how they're award-winning, when I wouldn't even consider them in the top few burger places within a 2 mile radius. The sauce on them was really good, but the burger itself was nothing special.",

I ordered the charcuterie meat platter like the other two times I've been here and the Sicilian pizza like the last time. The charcuterie meat platter is my absolute fave and the only time I order such platters at restaurants. The pizza is made pretty well. Their service... Everyone's friendly, but I can tell today that they're understaffed because as we're trying to get our bill our waiter is non-existent and unable to flag down. The manager is just as friendly and so often checks up on us.  Edit: I thought I posted my edit but I guess not. I wrote this before I got the bill and frankly I was dissatisfied when leaving. The waiter only paid attention to the large party and the tables outside. My table and another had a hard time flagging him down and it took maybe 30 minutes to get our bill. The manager had offered to get us a box but must have forgotten.",

The menu is quite basic and limited.   They claim to have an award winning burger.. idk Was trying to figure out if it's just bar food or something more culinary. We ordered some drinks and lunch. And waited... a long time for the food. To be fair, we were super hungry, so after 20 minutes we waved down a server and asked her to have the kitchen go ahead and send out whatever was ready, instead she proceeded to question us about what we ordered... 'a salad, burger and fish tacos'.. OK finally she went into the kitchen, and came back out but never came back to give us an update on our food.  Finally the salad arrived, and then 5 minutes later the burger and tacos came. The food was oh-kay, but not worth the wait, price or lack of service. We walked out, and a young man was sitting on his phone, who casually looked up and said goodbye.  It is a very laid back environment, so if that's cool with you, then enjoy :)",

    "text": "I hate to do this to a place that I have really enjoyed going to over the course of the last few years, but yesterday I had a terrible experience here. It started off fine, my wife and I wanted to sit on the patio and our server, Alex, came up to us and he seemed like a cool dude. He asked us right away if we knew what we wanted to drink and told him that we needed to look at the menu first. He then didn't come back for a while and then we ordered some drinks. I personally did not care for my beer at all. It was super bitter. However, this wasn't even the disappointing part. So we decided to share the Ivan burger, the happy hour chicken wings, and the happy hour bruschetta appetizer. The bruschetta appetizer came out first and I kid you not there were multiple moldy spots on the sides of the bread. Unfortunately, I did not notice this until my wife and I already took a bite of the bruschetta. It was gross. So our server comes over and I explain to him that there is mold on the bread and he doesn't seem apologetic at all. He was just like \"oh do you want me to have them make you another one\"? I'm sorry but after knowing that you have moldy bread I don't think I want MORE of that. I was hoping that since they served us rotten, old food that he would comp our chicken wings or our drinks or something? But nope. In fact, once we got the bill we noticed that he actually charged us more for getting a side of wing sauce to go with the wings? Super stingy, super unprofessional, and he clearly wasn't looking to make the customer happy. It's one thing to serve your customers moldy food, but it's another thing to act like it's no big deal when you do. Very disappointing experience, and hopefully this server gets talked to or management can train staff to handle these situations differently. Sadly, I had to cross this place off my go-to restaurants in Phoenix.",

It took awhile for our bartender to acknowledge us, but she was busy, we ordered some water and a couple of drinks.  It was Happy Hour until 6:30pm on Saturday, so we always feel lucky when we stumble into a good happy hour, especially on a Saturday (win!) $2 off glasses of wine.   I have a gluten allergy and while they do offer a gluten free bun ($2.50 extra I believe) I decided to have the Ivan burger without a bun and have it on a bed of lettuce with a small side salad and some balsamic dressing.  I chose pepper jack cheese and added mushrooms.   My husband also chose the Ivan burger, with the pretzel bun it comes with, he chose to add bacon and cheese. Also got a small side salad with a side of ranch.   In comparison to eachother, our side salads and they were completely different salads. Mine had cherry tomatoes and red onions. My husband's came with cucumbers, tomatoes and red onions.  Honestly, the service could have been better, all I really expect is for the server or bartender to pretend they are happy to serve me.  Refilling water and asking what temperature our food should be is the standard for service, not the exception.",

I tried the Baked Pretzel and the burger special (I'm blanking on the name). Both were delicious, but the burger was perfectly cooked with crispy onions and tangy BBQ sauce on a well-toasted pretzel bun. There is a great beer selection as well. I will definitely be back to hopefully sit on the outdoor patio and try some of their other food options.",

    "text": "It's a cozy sports bar that specializes in acclaimed burgers as well as craft beers. With a fireplace, comforting wooden decor, and a stunning view of mountains down the road, The Attic feels like a little slice of Sedona--aesthetic, yet overrated.   Let's start with the good. The Attic is formidable in the realm of craft beer, with rare finds from remote breweries like Tombstone to keep your Untappd score higher than everyone you know. While heavy on IPAs (that stopped being cool in like 2016) there's something for everyone. Promoters from the well-known O'Dell brewery stopped by my table to greet me and give complimentary glasses and stickers, which is a testament to this establishment's acumen for building relationships with the industry.  Nevertheless, I was left content yet unimpressed by the food here. I suppose I'll get the coolest aspect of the burgers out of the way--they're very vegetarian friendly. My date ordered an Impossible burger, and it's cool they have both that and a bean-based option. For myself, I went with the Holmburger, complete with candied jalapenos and \"sriracha-candied\" pancetta. The star of this burger, however, is the pretzel bun. The bread was incredibly dense and thick, so much so that you kinda feel like you're gorging on that rather than what's between it. It was also cold, which is a bummer when I'm so used to premium buns being warm and a little toasty. Perhaps pretzel is treated differently?  Nevertheless, it just tasted like a regular bacon cheeseburger, and the fries they came with were soggy and bland. Sorry if I'm nitpicking, it's just average. Nothing I would recommend going out of your way for, even with the Wednesday deal, which grants $5 off any burger + beer. It's OK. Just OK! Deal with it.",

    "text": "Well this is a bummer. We've been here a few times before and had very good experience, food service beer selection all good...... however this will be our last time.    Service was maybe the worst we've ever had and that is saying something. It was Trisha or Tonya or something else that totally did not impress me.  She had very nice hair but her hands and nails made me doubt she had washed them in the last 24 hours.  Obviously new since she didn't know the beers and was overwhelmed with basically everything.  It's too bad she may be a nice person but sucks as a server and needs to look for another profession.   It took at least 20 minutes to order and receive our first beer. Thank god i knew enough to put in a order of wings, hoping they would come out hot and hold us over. Wings were delivered hot and crispy that was the high point of our meal.   We ordered a burger to split again hoping for the the best.  It was the Ivan split order medium on pretzel bun.  When it did arrive like 40 minutes later it was flat heated god knows how many times in microwave to the point it was well done and and the bun literally looked dried and dead.  The food around us looked great buns and burgers looked awesome ours sucked.   We'll be staying in Scottsdale no reason to visit this place or any other establishment in \"Arcadia\". What a joke!!!",

Came here with a friend to watch Game 2 of the Stanley Cup championship and chose this place out of pure convenience for the both of us since it was the closest from our locations. It was a Wednesday, and they had a special - get any burger & a draft and get $5 off. For my burger, I got one of the veggie burgers since I'm not a big red meat eater & I didn't see any white meat burgers on the menu. The fries were yummy but the burger was honestly overwhelmingly healthy and are for True vegetarians (not me).   The atmosphere here was awesome. There were TVs by the bar, outside by the patio, and all around the seating areas inside. It was easy to find a seat/table and watch the game comfortably. It was too warm to be out in the patio but I'd definitely consider sitting outside next time. Overall, this is a super solid place if you wanna watch any game and be comfortable.",

    "text": "Came here with a group of friends on a Friday night and got seated on the balcony. There were overhead heaters so even though we were outside, it was still nice. I got a pint of the Figueroa Mountain and a green tea shot (whiskey, peach schnapps, sour mix, and sprite). The beer was what you'd expect for a lager, nice and light. The green tea shot was really good and easy to drink! If you're having trouble deciding between which beer to get, you can get free tastings!  I got the chicken tenders, which was part of their Friday specials. It comes with 2 sauces - I got the attic and honey bbq. The attic sauce is their specialty sauce which contains buffalo sauce. It doesnt seem like they're consistent with their ratios in making it though because my friend and I compared ours and they were very noticeably different colors! Mine was more red, which indicated it had more buffalo/hot sauce. The order comes with fries and only 3 chicken tenders, which didn't seem like much but I was full by the end - probably because I ate a bit before coming here. I thought the chicken tenders were alright - there wasn't anything special about them on their own and I had to dunk them in sauce. I was intrigued by the attic sauce but it's very thin and I much preferred the honey bbq sauce. The fries were very mediocre and I probably could have done without them - and I LOVE fries. I liked the ambiance of the restaurant but I would order something else if I came back.   They have limited parking in the back and most of them are parallel parking spaces, so it would be a good idea to carpool if you're going in a group when it's gonna be busy.",

I punched the coordinates in and headed on over, up the stairs and in we went. The space is definitely interesting and my beer senses immediately started tingling. The rows of beer taps and the writing on the walls (all of the wonderful beers to swill down) told me that I would like this place.   And I did. Quite a bit. I was pleasantly surprised by how good the wings were and they were less expensive than many places are so that was a perk. The wings were soon followed by the Hangover burger, which was cooked as ordered and was everything I was hoping. The worst part of my meal was simply picking which beer I wanted to order next!  The service was good enough, the place was busy, so I am not going to complain. I cant quite put a finger on why I have just remembered to review this place and why I haven't returned. I think I will make my triumphant return to the place of many beers and good food sooner than later.",

I came for a Friday fish fry sometime in the last year and the fish was amazing. My friend and I tried to come back again and the server insisted they never did that? Idk, maybe it was a 1 time gig or something but they should make it an all the time gig. The only downfall of this place is the service. Terribly slow. Usually takes forever for someone to even greet you. Drinks will sit empty for a while and if you ask for any extras, plan to ask for them at least 3 more times.  I'll personally tolerate bad service for good beer and food though.",

Also they were terrible at refilling drinks. Skip the pretzels, but the wings are good. This place has great potential but the dining experience left us super disappointed. Despite going during happy hour and splitting two apps and one entree, our bill was still $40 total so not a great value (we didn't get any beers either).",

The fries that came with were also nice and crispy. I ordered my burger medium rare and unfortunately recieved it medium well. I'm not too snarky with burgers so I let that one go.   The beer list is also pretty decent but pretty pricey as is the menu ($12-14 for a burger, around $7 for draft beer). I'm rating this place 3 stars as the burger was not how I ordered it and our waitress was somewhat slow and not as on the ball as I would have liked. Either way, cool place, nice seating, and a great atmosphere. Will definitely come back.",

    "text": "I called the restaurant in November to see if I could reserve the patio for a bridal party dinner. I was given Ivan's name and number as he was the manager and the one I would work with to arrange the event which took place in late January. I figured two months was plenty of notice and, if the restaurant could not accommodate my group of 15-20 people, the manager would let me know.  I had been to the Attic with my friend before (the bride) and I know it is quite \"cozy\" (small) but I figured, if we could reserve the space ahead of time, all would be good. SO, after speaking with Ivan at least three times over the course of the last two months, we show up to the restaurant the day of only to find that we do not have a reservation. It was as if they had no idea we were coming! They seated us at their largest table near the entrance which wasn't large enough to accommodate the entire party. I asked our totally overwhelmed server if Ivan was around and she went to get him. When he comes over, I remind him of my name and that we had previously spoken on the phone and that he had assured me that the outside patio would be available to accommodate our party.  His response was \"I will see what I can do\". 20 minutes later, he has set up tables and chairs for us outside, however, there is still not enough seating for everyone and it was a very tight squeeze with all of the other patrons who were on the patio.  It was clear that my party was somewhat of an annoyance to Ivan's other guests (not our intentions, whatsoever!).  We had to wait for another party of 4 to finish their meal before everyone in our group could have a seat. In addition, it was also clear that the restaurant was not expecting such a large group because our waitress and servers seemed very overwhelmed. It took a couple of my friends 20-30 minutes and multiple reminders to receive their drink orders.  We were at the restaurant for over 4 hours before our meal was finished. That being said, most everyone I spoke with enjoyed their meal and, once we were comfortably seated, the atmosphere was enjoyable.  I think the servers and kitchen did everything they could to make the night go as smoothly as possible and I understand how difficult it is working with such a large group.  The reason I am giving the Attic 2 our of 5 stars is that, while Ivan was able to literally \"squeeze\" us in at the last minute, there was no apology; no acknowledgement that he had inconvenienced any of us as well as other customers of his on the patio that night. My advice, if you do choose to come here, is to come with no more than 4 people and don't bother calling in advance.",

    "text": "I found this place through the Arizona Beer week event.  I wanted to try something new for my birthday so I thought I'd give this place a shot.  It is appropriately called the Attic because it is on the top floor of a two-story building.  When you walk in there is a small lounge seating area.  To the left you walk in and see the tiny kitchen that is open for guests to see.  The floor plan is long and narrow with dim lighting and tables on either side against the walls.  The bar is on the left and has seating on the inside and on the outside where there is a good sized balcony with a walled fireplace and tables as well as a bar height top with seating along the outside parameter of the balcony.  I tried the Ivan burger.  This is probably the best burger I have ever had!  It is 1/2 lb. beef burger with your choice of cheese. It is simple and comes with red onions, tomato, and dark green lettuces, and it has a creamy chipotle mayo all on a pretzel bun.  So juicy it melts in your mouth.  It also, comes with sweet potato fries which are also good.  I had the pleasure of meeting the Owner and creator of the Ivan, (named after him of course).  The rare beers they had on tap for the beer event were really good also,  I was very happy that I chose The Attic to go to and enjoy for the evening.   If you are looking for a great burger you must go to the Attic!",

This time however was the first time in my life my boyfriend and I actually got up and left prior to putting in an order. This completely rude and bitchy blonde waitress knew nothing about the menu and was visibly irritated at our simple questions- do you still have the peach Belgium beer? Which wings are the crispy ones that are not as messy as usual wings? We had these things last time so we wanted them again without looking at the menu. Her answers: beer- whatever Is on the menu, ok which is most like that one then since its not on the menu anymore- i don't know, whatever is on the back was her reply.  wings- whatever is on the menu, ummmm that would be the dry ones- mind you we didnt even look at menu cuz we just wanted what we had Last time. When we asked if they had iced tea and whether it was sweetened or unsweetened she rolled her eyes like too many questions or something. Her entire demeanor sucked. Shes a server and those were basic restaurant questions so that we could have what we had last time, nothing she should have been so visibly annoyed about.  We believe in positive energy so we left and went to Sushi Brokers instead. Please fire that rude server- I wish I had gotten her name. Turned a wonderful experience at a new place right down the road to a place we will need to decide if we will go to again. Their food is excellent but depending on the server, your experience may not be worth it.",

    "text": "This place was recommended  by a co worker because of the burgers.  Decent place and my guy and I decided to split a burger and ordered a MEDIUM cooked cheddar n bacon burger w/fries. At first burger came (cut in half for us to split) and it was clearly RARE!  Tons of pink (which the boyfriend cannot stand).  We explained to the waitress and she completely agrees and returns to the kitchen. After a short time the burger returns cooked WAY MORE to a medium however the fries sat while they took the burger, recooked and put BACK ON NOW SOGGY/BLOODY BUN! This burger plate we AGAIN return that and request a new bun and remotely warm fries. The waitress apologizes and agrees to make a new burger (very nice btw). So new burger comes promptly and.....PINK!!  Ugh! I was ok w/the pink this time but my (prefers hamburgers of 'leather' status) man was unhappy.  So after going through all this we finally ate .....and .....NOT anything to write home about.  The meat was decent but NOTHING i'd tell friends about.  If I'm gonna pay $13-14 bucks a burger it better taste above most else and this DID NOT. It was decent but so is some neighborhood bars for $8.  They did take 50% off our burger which was really cool I felt but....we most likely will not be back.",

With camelback mountain in the distance, the patio is the perfect place to enjoy one of their many craft brews while waiting for wings or a burger. While the food is good, the Ivan burger (apparently rated one of the top in the country) is the star of the show. The only thing that could use improvement is the service, which left much to be desired!",

Ryan, their beer pro, is knowledgable, and remembers what we typically like to drink, so recommendations are on point, and always let's us try new beers! Can't complain about the view of Camelback either. They offer events weekly, such as special tappings/brewery events/dinners... so always something interesting to taste. A couple TVs if you're looking to watch a game. Good vibe, wether you'd like to socialize with your own friends and not be bothered, or meet new people. Highlights for me include the burgers (and I'm not even a big burger fan), and the bruschetta (amazing unique sauce). Unique space on a second story, great view, good food, awesome specialty beer selection, friendly perople who remember your name (or at least your drink)...what's not to like?",

The pepperoni on the pizza were nice and crisp and had good flavor to them. The cheese wasn't bad. The edges of the pizza were nice and crisp which I liked, however where this dish fell short was the crust. Aside from the crust edges, the crust was doughy, soft, limp and had no texture that it should have because that's the point of the pizza crust. I wouldn't order pizza from here again. I then had half of The famous Ivan burger. On the menu it stated the Ivan was one of the top 5 burgers in the world. I beg to differ. The Ivan has to be the best burger on this planet! The meat was juicy and flavor exploded in your mouth with each bite of just the meat by itself, not to mention the amazing fixings they put on the burger, and the bun was phenomenal. I would have given two stars based off of the pizza but I had to bump my review up to 4 stars after that burger.",

I had missed the night that the group went to the reigning king, Relish.   Well I can say there is a new King.  The Attic. Among 8 guys, I think 6 of us agreed this was the best burger we have discovered so far. I have since been back 3 times with people who are not part of our group but who also love a good burger (well, who doesn't) and so far, everyone has loved it.    Didn't think I would care for the pretzel bun, but it's the perfect foil for the perfectly cooked egg atop The Hangover.   Only criticism I would have is that my burgers tend to get slightly over cooked here. But still delicious.",

    "text": "May I give negative stars?  After a long week of coordinating 700 state tests for my school, I felt that I had earned a nice break, so happy hour at the Attic it was!  My friend does barre classes nearby and suggested the place.  I had high expectations- I could say I was disappointed, but that would be an understatement.  When I left there I had intimate knowledge of what it feels like to be treated like a third class citizen. My friend and I were blatantly disrespected by not one, not two, but THREE different employees. They didn't even try to feign any sort of semblance of customer service. I've been to some pretty sub-par places with so-so food and crappy service, but this, by far, was the worst experience I have ever had ANYWHERE.   IT took me a good week to stop being aggressively  pissed off. I can't say anything to the quality of the food because we never got that far, but I can say that if you're feeling masochistic, this is a great choice.  Yours truly, a great lover of a good glass of Pinot (gasp) left an almost full glass there to be poured down the drain.  The saddest part of my whole experience is that they don't even care. The older blonde hostess (who looked to be the manager) didn't even try to pretend to care. This is not some 5 star elite restaurant-and I've been to some- and they certainly don't treat people like this.   I feel it is my duty to warn people to stay away from this place.  Check out Oh-So or Postino or even Chick Fil A for that matter.  Trust me you'll be glad you did. :(.  Still pissed -and it's been a couple weeks.   I live in this area, and trust me I will never set foot in this place again. EVER  Someone requested to know more of the story, here is a kind of synopsis: Let's see, how to trim down the convoluted story -here it is is a nutshell:   They knowingly, and rather arrogantly decided to seat another couple before us (the gentleman was wearing scrubs, READ:  doctor)  Then they argued about it (two people).  I saw the couple actually walk up the stairs and my friend's name was already written on their chalkboard.  But, NO, they were right!  Not the couple mind you, the employees! The waitress/bartender threw our change at us (literally) and said some snarky comments as she walked away (mind you, this is all while we're sitting on the \"waiting\" bench.)  The manager and the other hostess OPENLY talked about us and pointed at us and proceeded to argue with us as we walked out - as we finally made a smart decision and left.  When I left and the valet guy asked how our night was, I asked him if we were on a hidden camera show.   I told one of my other friends about it and she found a blog called \"How I became a douchebag diner\".  Google it, that pretty much is a parallel to our feelings as we left, but of course more eloquently put.",

Anyways, you have to walk upstairs to get to the place but I didn't mind that at all. Me and my bf were greeted by two very polite men that were behind the counter and we were prompted to seat ourselves wherever we'd like. I love that :) anyways, we ordered the bruschetta and pretzel as an appetizer. The pretzel was good as well as those little cheeses and mustards that came with it. The bruschetta had a little too much tomato and Brie. The entrees we had were 'The Ivan Burger' and the Margherita pizza. Both were very delicious, the pizza was more than I expected..i definitely would come back just for it. Our waitress was very cute and nice and  knowledgable but I forgot her name. But this place is very cool and next time I come back I will try their patio. Did I mention that it has a fire place?? Yep I'll be back.",

I enjoyed the various beer pulls hanging along the wall and the outdoor seating it's classy with a fireplace and has an incredible view of Camelsback mountain.  However, that was the extent of this experience.   I had the \"Hangover\" burger and the \"Santa Fe\" wings. The burger I enjoyed the bun and although the burger was decent, I've definitely have had better and their fries are served well done, brown? For $14 and this highly reviewed/recommended place, I was expecting a WOW for my tastebuds, but that didn't happen.  The wings were on HH special six for only $3, great deal and I did like the wings to have them again.  I'm wondering if during our visit with a party of 4 and other customers filling in, more servers would be ideal. It was took a long time for service including not getting any refills of water or other beverages, food came out slowly and my burger didn't come out with the other couple with us. Our waitress said , \"we don't know what happened, it was put on the ticket and entered into the computer, but didn't come up? No apology but said we're making it right now.\" Okay, no biggie.  We were enjoying our company and stay.  I ended up getting refills for our table of waters and sodas for myself and my friend at the bar next to our table. I didn't think anything was wrong with this, since I thought I was helping out our waitress since she hadn't come around and we were out of drinks throughout our stay, but the second time I did this our waitress was clearly not happy I did this and made a comment directly at me on what I was doing, I answered I'm getting us our refills and smiled. Talk about Awkward.   Should I give our service the benefit of the doubt? I don't know, I might try them out again socially with friends but I know there's a lot of other places to try and recently many of us dined elsewhere and the burger quality of the beef was great.

We went up the stairs to find a chalkboard to put our name on the waitlist... cute idea. We waited a short amount of time and were seated. The place was very busy, but our service was fast, friendly, and efficient. The husband and I each got the Ivan with bacon, I got a side salad and he had fries. The burger was a very standard burger. It wasn't anything I was terribly excited about, but it was large and tasty enough for the price. I will say, I wouldn't want to pay full price for this particular burger, but the hangover burger sounded good. The salad was tasty and had a great balsamic vinaigrette. I would come back here for their specials again and would like to try their happy hour, but I am not sure that I would come here on a regular day (the hangover burger is 14$.... that's a bit steep).",

First impression of The Attic was the annoyance over having to just find the place.They didn't have a clear sign on the road. Second was the required valet parking. I don't care if it's \"free\" (let's be real, you still need to tip the guys), but showing up at a tap house, you're not exactly expecting to hand your car over to someone.  When we got upstairs, they had a clearly marked sign that said SEAT YOURSELF, so we thought, \"okay,\" and started wandering around for a place to sit, squeezing ourselves all the way to the back and then circling around. No seats. Got back up to the front and asked one of the servers, who looked at us like we were stupid and said, \"you need to be put on the list.\" Okay. Take down your sign guys, why would you have that posted? So we sat in a small section off to the side waiting and proceeded to watch several other groups come in and do the same thing we did. Unfortunately, we couldn't warn them without jumping up and catching them as it is incredibly noisy on the inside and they wouldn't have heard us from where we were.  Food was alright, but not remarkable. Certainly not worth the hassle. And the beer was good, but it's not exactly hard to come across good craft beer in the valley these days.  It would have to be someone's birthday, or they'd have to have some damn, good special tapping for me to go back.",

I told the sever we had 4 adults and 2 kids, she relys \"I only have a 4 top if you want to be seated now\".  Soooo, do I tell the kids to wait outside?",

My friend and I also split a burger with fries and a pizza.  She has a hollow leg, I swear.  Anyway, the food was great and everyone was really friendly.  Aside from the meat and cheese plate (to die for) I think the fries were my fave...super golden and crunchy on the outside...thin but not shoe-string...and I don't even like fries that much.  So there you have it!",

Our most recent date night was definitely on my list of worst restaurant experiences. They got the order for our burger wrong and did not offer to correct it. Instead insisted on bringing another bun with no sauce or onion. Although annoyed we agreed but when our bill came we saw that they charged us for an \"extra bun\" . Well the other one was just thrown away so not sure what the extra charge was for. We had it removed before paying but I'll it was definitely not a good customer service experience.",

I have had the pizza here, the hangover burger, the pretzel, and the wings and they have all been spectacular. For my beer drinkers, you'll love the selections on the list and they are so much more than your different pale ale options, they have some really interesting beers on tap! I had a plum beer and a chocolate stout beer and both were outstanding.  Katie should be your go-to if you want good service and a chick with knowledge on brews. My friend also asked her for a \"smooth\" wine and Katie hooked her up with one and she loved it.   I'd suggest to take full advantage of the patio if the weather permits and enjoy the view. This place is great!",

Got to the top of the stairs to be informed by some poor staff person that this restaurant is charging a $10 cover because they're showing some UFC fight. WHAT. I guess I wasted that Lyft ride.   They have a downstairs area (sacks) they've served folks in before. Never mind that it's super weird to charge a cover to watch tv, why didn't they just charge upstairs and not downstairs? We saw several other people leave disappointed. Wonder if they made enough from the cover to make up for the lost business that night and in the future.",

Walk up the stairs to the second floor and you'll find the Attic. The sign that greets you says to seat yourselves, so we chose prime seats on the patio overlooking Camelback Mountain. Happy hour is 4-6:30pm, Mondays through Fridays, and features $2 off all appetizers, $1.50 off beer by the glass, and $2 off wine by the glass. The beer selection changes frequently and there's a decent wine list (I got a Moscato and my friend got a cider). For food, we ordered the fish tacos (a bit cold) and the bruschetta with pancetta (good flavor, but a bit cold). Service was fair, not awful, not stellar.   Solid place to hang out after work. I will probably come here again to try one of their burgers and to enjoy the patio.",

It's really frustrating to find a place that has great food and great hospitality. (Also with a fantastic beer selection)  My husband and I walked in on 04/18/15 at around 11:20am to grab a bite to eat and something to quench our thirst. We decided to sit at the bar because it was just opening time and figured we would talk to our server/ bartender. SHOUT OUT TO LINDSAY!!! She's been the first person to just talk with us... about the craft brew scene, traveling to different breweries and other awesome beer related stuff.   Then the food came... I ordered the Holmbuger?? I believe was its mythical name. It was beefy, it was spicy, it was sweet, it was juicy... it was just heaven between two pretzel buns.   Needless to say we WILL be back because it's not just good food that makes a great place, it's the people that work there and care.  ALSO SHOUT OUT to the guy wearing the Sriracha Shirt (you know who you are) who asked us if we were happy with everything while we were walking out. The fact that this guy sincerely cared about our experience made me want to write this review and give this place the 5 stars it deserves.   Thank you, Kerrie",

The staff all around were great though.  She was helpful with her favorite picks and guiding our indecisive nature to a brew that would be in the neck of the woods of our palate.  The attic is definitely known for their burgers but we tried the Pizza since we were .  Sausage and Mushroom was the choice and it was pretty decent.  Thin crust that was a little flimsy but the dough was tasty, toppings good and cheese plenty.  I'm holding back that star for maybe a crispier crust next time.  If you're looking for a patio when the weather is better their patio is a great look at Camelback and for the sports goer they have plenty of TVs to keep your conversations minimal and your cheering at a maximum!",

    "text": "So my Aunt has been raving about the burgers here.  I like a good burger joint, though this place isn't technically a burger joint.  It has pizza, but its not a pizza spot.  The inside is like a sports bar, but its not really a sports bar.  It has a decent wine and craft brew selection, but its not really a brewpub.  So okay, this place is pretty much impossible to classify.  Which I assume is pretty much the idea.  For the record, I am aware of the social media snafu that occurred here months ago where the general manager viciously attacked an angry customer on social media for her poor review.  I guess the fact that this business is still standing must mean they took appropriate action to satisfy their patrons (or at least I hope so).  At any rate, my experience didn't have any drama, but did involve some good food.  Didn't do any appetizers here as I was told to come here for one reason.  The Ivan.  This burger was so hyped by my Aunt it was borderline ludicrous.  The specs:  a pretzel bun, huge juicy patty, tomato, your choice of cheese (I went cheddar), mixed greens, and chipotle mayo.  Fantastic burger.  The chipotle mayo and the pretzel bun absolutely make the difference.  Quality of the beef was excellent.  I got mine with a side salad, but you can get fries too.  For dessert we got the chocolate molten cake.  This was a disappointment.  The texture of the chocolate was fine, but the cake itself was rock hard.  It was edible, but not especially impressive.  The service we received was friendly throughout.  Our waitress got confused by a couple of the orders we put in, but quickly rectified the situation so no need to dock her too many brownie points for that.  Tonight they had discounts on their burgers so I saved $4 on the Ivan.  Total cost for tonights meal including the burger, side salad, a beer, and a chocolate cake, tax and tip was about $25.  I'd definitely come back to try some of the rest of their menu. A couple of tips, get here early as parking in the area is pretty limited.  Also, sit outside if the weather is right.  Its not as noisy and has a great view of the Arcadia neighborhood.  And take it from me, the Ivan lives up to the hype.",

The only reason this place doesn't get a 5-star rating is because the staff here rarely smiles.  And I mean RARELY!!  Sometimes they're friendly-ish, but most of the time they just seem sapped of any sort of enthusiasm, so service drags.

Climbed the winding staircase to this treasure at the advice of a friend. restaurant is clean and wide open, patio overlooks Arcadia landscape and you're up high. Happy hour is indeed happy, $3 wings and many specials.  If you're a watery beer drinker, beware, this place serves craft brews and there are no baby beers on tap. We enjoyed several brews and perused the menu. The ambiance is, well, mixed. Some hipsters enjoying the days while right next to them were some more \"picky\" clientele. I won't say more. This is Arcadia, the locals are allowed in, pleasant or otherwise.   We tried an order of wings in every flavor and their specialty of the day, an Italian sandwich featuring Salami, which was beyond our expectation. Hey, the bread was good. We like that. The Attic Wings were a not-too-sweet soy/honey mix that really hit the spot. The buffalo style, well, pass on these, they seemed to be thickened with flour to the point of the sauce sitting on there 1/2 inch thick.  My veggie friend had huge hot pretzel and enjoyed that.  The chef came out and spoke with us and he seemed really interested in our experience.   Off happy hour pricing looks high. But hey, that's what Happy Hour is for.",

I was expecting the Sicilian pizza to be a little bit more tasty. Hangover hamburger had bacon and eggs which earned the accolades from burger magazine as one if the best. The best surprise were the fries that come with the burger. They were prepared perfect, crispy but not over done.  The place is upstairs with a small parking area. If you are into beer, this is the place for you with a huge selection on tap.  The service was good and friendly. Could see this place as a great place to hang out to eat and drink",

We meet up on a Wed night, mostly because they have a wed night special of a burger & beer for 10 bucks! Man that's a great deal!   I'm not really a beer drinker, but overheard a fellow Yelper say that Stouts are like a coffee base/flavored, I like coffee, so this might work, I saw the #6 was a Bells Cherry Stout, and that's the one I picked.  I enjoyed the stout, it didn't taste the same as a normal beer and it has a heavy body to it. I liked it. It went well with my burger too.  The burger in this beer & burger deal for 10 bucks is the Ivan. Let me tell you, Ivan is beefy, juicy and messy, just the way I like it.  It's on a pretzel bun, has lettuce, tomato, chipotle mayo, cheese and bacon if you like. I ordered mine medium rare, and it was oooohhhhh ssssooooo goooood!!   The only downside for this evening was the fries, this was my 3rd stop for a burger in a just a matter of a couple of weeks and I again run into SHOESTRING FRIES!!! Come on PHOENIX, these are not real fries!! But these were worst then shoestrings; they were the mini shoestring, the half pints of the crew!! Now I am an Irish girl and love me some spuds, so you betcha those half pint mini shoestring fries were eaten up!  Other than the shoestring fries, everything else was a perfect, The Attic is a great find and I look forward to coming back.",

We get the last indoor high top table with a glimpse to the outside patio.    The charcuterie & cheese plates were awesome!  The charcuterie featured at least 4 meats, pickles, artichokes, and a horseradish cheese.  The cheese plate had half an apple, 3 cheeses including an herb cheddar and Brie.  This was served with seeded crackers and crostini straws.  I subtracted a star because they did not explain the charcuterie or cheese types to us and it does not detail the cheese selections on the menu.  I enjoyed chatting in the lively weeknight environment and our service was just enough to be taken care of.  We never had an empty water glass and never felt rushed.",

Definitely sit outside, there's very few times in AZ that you're able to without dying of heatstroke :) Thanks for a great experience everyone   Love the location, loved the appetizers and bottle of wine half off on Sunday's!! What I didn't love....... Have you ever had a waitress who is very attentive and friendly? But then it turns into OVERLY attentive and friendly to where it ruins your experience? Oh my.   I'm all for up-selling as I have been a waitress, but there's a difference from up-selling and basically badgering every time you come by the table. I couldn't enjoy my bottle of wine. My husband was also getting irritated with her. I'm sorry but you shouldn't come by our table literally once every 3-5 minutes trying to get us to order something else.   After we ordered wine and an app, \"this app is also great, wanna order with your wine?\" \"no thanks, we're just relaxing and will order more in a bit.\" Five minutes later-- \"Wanna order another bottle of wine? Your entree?\" \"Nope, we will let you know.\" 3 minutes later-- \"what entrees are you looking at and I can tell you more?\" Husband asks opinion. She says, \"I'd recommend this, alright should I put the order in?!\" WTF, NO!!! I clearly said I wasn't ready 3 mins prior, and I'd like to eat dinner with my husband when we're both ready! Why is that so complicated? The entire time went exactly like this and we were literally there maybe an hour.. Not all day or anything. It's very annoying and makes me question whether your food is worth it to even come back. Writing this made me more angry and I bumped it from 3 to a 2 star.",

But, what once was $10 for a delicious Ivan Burger and a craft beer is now $14 to $16 depending on the beer you order. They also used to have a weekly beer rep doing a mini sampling of a line of craft beers and handing out swag. The Wednesday I went, there was no rep to enhance the beer and burger experience. I also get the impression they cycle through waitstaff frequently. At least half the times I have been there the waitress has admitted it was her first week working there.  Call me old fashioned, but if I am paying $14 for a burger, I expect to be in a place with better than a basic sports bar atmosphere.  However, if you are a fan of burgers, they are still tasty. They pair well with their nice selection of craft beers on tap. Finally, their main drawing point and reason for their \"Attic\" name comes from being a rooftop bar with a of Camelback Mountain (if you overlook the busy Indian Bend Road below)",

I wanted to try the saison, but the server had never tasted it and knew nothing about it (She actually didn't even know what it was until I pointed to it on the menu). Upon asking for a taste, I was told that I could not have one because their tasters are all 2 ounces. I said that I did not need anywhere near that amount...just a small squirt in the bottom of the shot glass to get an idea of the flavor. Amongst other excuses about not allowing tastes to keep the prices down, I was told that they have \"special\" taps that can't pour under 2 ounces. That's when I called BS. No reputable ale house, brewery, or most bars for that matter, would trousers to provide a small taste and risk a customer not being satisfied with their order. So I told the server that I would simply order and then send it back if I didn't like it since they were giving me no other option and she knew absolutely nothing about it. When I received it, as soon as I touch my lips to it, I could tell it was pretty much a sour... Something I definitely wouldn't have wanted had I known. Anyone with any knowledge of their menu should have known something this obvious about the flavor profile. I sent it back, but was still charged. I would've argued to take it off, but my friend decided to pay for it rather than make it an issue. Too many other great places in town so no reason to return. Hash kitchen is opening next-door, I will definitely be going there for brunch next time instead... or to roaring fork if I want a burger.",

I come every Wednesday for the burger and beer special. They have featured amazing collaboration burgers with the likes of Little Miss BBQ. There is complimentary valet on busy nights, but I park on a side street if they have valet. Get the Ivan, everytime, all the time. And be sure to check in on Untappd, 100 check-ins for forever happy hour prices. Sunsets....camelback....TVs for days. Best place to go for sour beers at a reasonable price point. Wednesday's any beer and burger for only $10.",

I am curious yet skeptical by nature so when I read the claim that The Ivan Burger is in the top 5 of burgers in the world I thought Id give it a shot. Happy to say my skepticism was pulverized!. Coming from Los Angeles there are a lot less gastropub \"foodie\" type places in Phoenix than I am used to and I am glad I found this place.   The bar was cool, the staff was friendly, and it was very clean. The crowd is pretty mellow but definitely there to drink. They have an ample bar with a lot of craft option. The only Con is that it was kind of confusing to find. Hint: it's called the attic because it is built into like a loft section of a commercial building.  TLDR: Order the Ivan Burger. Go up stairs.",

    "text": "My wife and I wanted to try something different, so after a Google search of best burgers in Phoenix, this place showed up. They do not appear to have a website. We thought we'd give it a try and our first problem was parking. It's 'complimentary' valet, unless you want to park on the opposite side of Indian School and Jay-walk across traffic. I didn't have any cash on me, so this put me immediately in an awkward position. I asked the valet if there were any ATMs inside and he recommended I download an app for my smartphone to pay him. I explained that my wife and I both have flip phones, so app downloading is not an option. He suggested I ask for some cash back at the end of my meal. I told him I would try it.  Next, we went up the stairs that leads to a tinted glass door with no writing on it. Would it kill them to stencil THE ATTIC on the door? We could see the restaurant through the windows alongside the top, but we were not certain the 'blank' door led to the entrance of it or some other business that might be upstairs. We walked back down the stairs and a bit further along the building only to realize those are the ONLY stairs, so back up the stairs we went for the second time.  When we walked in, a sign said to seat yourself and I could not find any employees anywhere. So we grabbed a table. Outside looked nice, but not when it's 110 degrees outside! Soon after we were greeted by a young man who poured us some water and said our waitress would be with us soon. That's when I realized the employees apparently wear whatever they want, t-shirts, polo shirts, pants, shorts, etc... This makes them completely indistinguishable from the guests!  While waiting, I counted 6 flat screen TVs showing football, grey paint on the walls, and the noise. Yes, it gets very loud in there in such a narrow, long space with people talking. I SAID IT GETS REALLY LOUD IN THERE AND MAKES IT HARD TO TALK TO THE PERSON YOU'RE DINING WITH ACROSS THE TABLE!  It's clear many of the guests dining here really love it, so the whole place has this great energy to it. Still, a $12 burger? A $14 burger? That's a lot of money for just a burger. Everything I read online and at Phoenix New Times was that their IvanBurger was to die for. My wife ordered it without the bun (lettuce wrap instead). Its a pretzel bun, which I think is a poor choice. They were also offering potato skins for $6, but you only got two. Two potato skins? Who does that? Most places bring you an app plate with 6-8 skins for the same price. So I didn't order that. Instead, I thought I would try the cheese pizza, since I read their pizza was good, too.  As we placed our order with our waitress, I asked if they had Coke or Pepsi? She said they had RC cola. Whoa! RC cola? Kalil drinks, like they serve at Arby's? Yes. So I ordered a beer instead. I'm not much of a beer drinker, but I ordered the Hawaiian 'Maul' which was a pretty good beer, but again, I'd be happy with a Bud Light - I'm just not into beer.   My wife order The Ivan with small salad ($12) and my cheese pizza ($10) and beer ($5.50) and just water for the wife. The Cave & Ives total was $27.50 +  $2.29 tax.  The pizza was cooked perfectly on the top, and barely at all on the bottom. The dough and cheese were very fresh, but the sauce tasted like its main ingredient was sugar. That's fine if you're dining at Peter Piper or Chuck E Cheese, but I expected something more 'adult.'  And that, therein, is my problem with this place. I think if I was in my 20's or 30's I'd want to dine at a hipster place that's hard to find the entrance, see my peers working without any uniform and watch the game while drinking microbrews. But at 47 years old, I can't and do not want to eat a burger that's over 10\" tall, with bacon and cheese and a pretzel bun. I just want a good burger on a whole wheat bun without the cheese or the bacon. Let the meat speak for itself rather than drown it with all the condiments. A restaurant called Charr offers it numerous ways, to serve all kinds of customers. I don't think most people over the age of 45 are in the demographic of who The Attic is trying to appeal to.  With all the condiments pushed to the side of her plate, my wife ate her lettuce-wrap burger and was very pleased with how it tasted and she was very pleased with the location and the atmosphere and the prices. Overall, though, she'd like to try coming back when the whether is cooler and we can sit out on the balcony and try some different menu items. The pretzel sounds amazing, but I was afraid if I ordered it, I would have no room left for dinner. Maybe next time.  Every one of the staff were very friendly. The menu is EXTREMELY limited and the prices are, in my opinion, about $4 too high for the burgers.  I explained the valet situation and the waitress did permit me to add an extra $2 to her tip, and she gave me that $2 cash back, which I then handed to the valet (also very courteous and professional) as they retrieved our car.",

Just a great meal all around.  I only had one but it was a delicious Belgian that paired great w the burger. Was unfiltered but really smooth and pretty potent. The ambiance and service is very good. Would like to hang out on the patio next time and sit by the fireplace. I plan on coming back and introducing it to some friends.  As a bonus - it's right above my favorite deli spot Sacks.",

I actually get sad if I'm in Phoenix and forget to eat here. One of my favorites for sure!  One time we got there and there was a waiting list (written on a chalkboard), after putting our name at the bottom and a few people were seated, some guy walks in and writes his name down at the top thinking he's outsmarted the system and will be seated with his friends who have yet to show up before everyone else. I politely mentioned it to the hostess, and she told me she saw him do that in the past. I told her where his name should have been placed given the 10+ groups that were actually before him; and she kindly noted it. Really lovely hostess, she's been great many times in the past as well; shes one of those people that actually cares about her job.  Either way, great establishment, and I will certainly visit and recommend to others!",

The flight was not what I expected, but we really enjoyed the Bourbon beer.  A good pils with the fish rounded out the evening nicely.  It was packed as expected, no valet, had to park across the street.  No evidence of the brewery personnel being on site with swag, as was publicized.  That was disappointing.

I have had better burgers at pretty much every other place around here, OHSO, Delux, Christ even the Chicago hamburger company down the streets sliders tasted better as far as I am concerned. Myself and my gf came on a Sunday afternoon, as I was walking up the stairs I stepped in a huge piece of fresh gum, obviously some uncultured swine that had just frequented the place must of spit this out, to say the least it was pretty gross, it took a minute to scrape off the bottom of my shoe, and was not the best start to my experience...we walked in and the bar was moderately busy... and all the tables were taken, I am not sure if there is suppose to be a hostess, there was no one around so we decided to seat our selves on the patio, to what seemed to be dismay of our server. She was horrible. Dulce. Poor attitude and not very friendly. Had to get up to ask for drink refills, also seemed like there was a huge issue with asking to turn the misters on outside, they turned them on and then a few minutes later turned them off, where I had to ask to turn them back on again it was just over 100 outside.  It took forever for our food to come out. On appearance alone the Ivan which probably stands close to 6 inches high looks pretty impressive, but taste wise...I was really not impressed. My Gf had the same thing...she too was not impressed, and she did not finish hers. The fries were mediocre...and as I said in general so was this experience here. Probably will never go back.",

The chipotle mayo was well paired with the burger and I even dipped my fries in it. The atmosphere was comfortable and not too pretentious and prices were reasonable. The view is amazing and I would certainly return.",

    "text": "This place used to be called Cave & Ives, which is very missed! The gentleman who owned it previously did however make a wise choice to sell it to another gentleman who knows restaurant biz as well. The Attic is a very delicious burger joint. They have the world's famous burgers and were appointed as one of the top burger joints in the United States. Which to my liking, they were excellent. You have to definitely try this place if you are a burger girl like me!",

    "text": "The Burger at The Attic is one of those burgers you can judge on looks alone. A glistening patty of beef that sits atop a pretzel bun stacked with fresh and well thought out ingredients. The full list of ingredients consists of a bakery-fresh pretzel bun, 1/2 pound of juicy beef, spring mix, tomato, chipotle mayo, and your choice of cheese (and you have to add the optional bacon). The burger pairs many complementary flavors and a blend of sweet, savory, and spicy along with the combination of fresh premium ingredients will make your mouth water. I'd personally suggest adding on the bacon and selecting provolone cheese. The chipotle mayo does plenty to bring a little bit of kick for your tastebuds. Egg was offered as an upgrade/option but I believe it wouldn't do much to complement all the veggies on the burger, and it would make the entire burger unmanageable. This gem is like hitting the jackpot... easily the best burger in Phoenix.",

Totally awesome. They apparently change featured beers  regularly so each trip should be a fun experience. We were also lucky to hit happy hour. $1.50 off on beer and very reasonably priced appetizers. Where can you find 3 types of chicken wings each  less than $5.  Plus you get a great view of nearby Camelback Mountain. Put this place on your wish list. You won't be disappointed.",

I really enjoyed the Bruschetta maybe more that the burger since it has Brie cheese on it along with a pesto aioli and a distinct sweat/slightly spicy additional aioli. Service was friendly and attentive. Great spot on a beautiful day.",

I wasn't hungry enough to order the huge burger that looked awesome as it kept passing by. Enough tv's to catch a game. Downside was that service was slow enough to be kind of annoying. Other than night, nice place to come chill for a little bit.",
