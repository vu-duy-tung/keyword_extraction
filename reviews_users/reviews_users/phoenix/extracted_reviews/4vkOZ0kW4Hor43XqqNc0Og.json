YES    The only complaint I would have is this: I typically dine solo and order appetizer, soup and entree.  I have a few bites of each and expect to take the rest home as leftovers. They always pack everything in small styrofoam container which would not be able to hold half of what I had left. They're throwing away MY food to save costs on to go containers.",

    "text": "Overall this place is worth a try. Really small and limited space with about 5-6 tables suitable for a whole of less than 20 people at the same time. The roasted duck salad is refreshing and the duck is crispy. The fried pineapple rice is a little bit different- not served in a pineapple as its bowl but instead, on a plain plate, which to my view, kinda impaired the flavor of the dish. The mango sticky rice can be better if more coconut milk was added. The service is fast, I guess because of the limited space and customers waiting outside. But the downside is that the waitresses came to our table so often just to check if we're still working - it's understandable but a little bit rushing. For this reason, i only give it a four-star.",

This restaurant's packed every day for lunch so that's a sign that their food's tasty. I always get the pad thai  and it's to die for!  The only  \"negative\" part about this restaurant's its size. It's ok for a small group but sometimes we're 10-15 people and we have to go somewhere else due to the fact that they can't accommodate a big group, which is sad because their food's very good and I know all of us really enjoy it.",

The four of us (my gf, her bf and my bf) arrived just around dinner to a cozy restaurant. We ordered our drinks and we decided each of us would order a dish.  We started with spring rolls and dumplings, and for our mains: drunken chicken noodles, BBQ thai sausage, cashew nuts with veggies & beef and a red thai curry. Since they weren't family style dishes, the non-noodle dishes came with sides of rice so that worked out great for us.   Everything was really delicious and flavourful! The spices weren't overwhelming and portions were really hearty.  I definitely agree with positive reviews of this place, some of the best Thai food I've had :)",

Nothing to write home about but acceptable. The portion was a bit on the small side, but the food came out really fast! So if you are looking for a quick bite to eat and you are not that picky, this may be your spot.   HOWEVER, do NOT go there if they are busy. I went back a day later with a friend and colleague for lunch, and because of a conference that is was in town, the restaurant was packed. I understand that it is hard to provide good service when it is busy, BUT even accounting for that, the service was really unacceptable. First of all, they put a glass of ice in front of us. Not water with ice, but literally a glass ice with a thimble full of water. We couldn't drink anything out of the glass and so we asked if they could dump the ice and give us some water The waiter actually said no!! He said he was too busy to do that. I was speechless. Then they brought our main meal, which came out fast, but we did not get our soup. We had to ask for it twice and when it arrived, one person only had some lukewarm broth. The spring roll was also lukewarm and soggy. All in all, it was NOT a very satisfying meal. Then they brought the check on our table when we had barely started eating!! I am giving this place two stars because my experience in the evening was ok, but I would give them no stars for lunch.",

My oldest daughter and I stopped in here after not being able to get a table in Cibo (a downtown pizzeria) due to the crowds downtown for First Friday.  The restaurant decor is nothing to dial home about and is EXTREMELY small and tight. This is not the place to go t if you want a quiet meal and or hear the conversation of those at your table.  Our dinner was interrupted by a loud group of 15 that was seated directly next to us about halfway through our meal and who kept bumping into our table...so much so that we hurriedly finished our meal to get out of the place.  The food itself was very bland and the food lacked flavor and attention to detail. The lack of detail even shows up in their business cards...someone misspelled Phoenix ( spelled as Pheonix)  on the cards they give out to customers when you leave the restaurant to drum up business for the Ahwatukee and Scottsdale locations....",

The phad Thai was different than what I usually consider phad Thai to be. The Thai basil had good flavors if you can get past the smell. The kitchen was playing loud rap music and could be heard pretty easily and kind of ruined the ambiance and atmosphere of the restaurant. They had lime in the water which gave it a refreshing flavor.",

Service also not good at all . Very dissapointed",

    "text": "Thai Basil is right across the street from my work and I finally went yesterday.  Cute atmosphere. Lunch specials were a good value. The starter salad, although consisting of only lettuce, had a very tasty dressing.   I ordered green curry with tofu and vegetables. One reason I ordered it was because of the great selection of veggies including broccoli and green beans it says it comes with on the menu. However it only came with onions, a ton of carrots, undercooked potato, and a couple pieces of eggplant. I was so sad! The curry itself was tasty, with a perfect medium spice. But I can't get over how many vegetables were omitted in the dish. Just unexcusable.  Service was okay. Pleasant enough but we did have to wait a bit to get our check. I probably won't return, unless coming with friends or coworkers. I prefer Vegan House.",

My pad thai chicken was way too sweet they poured a ton of the sauce... it was almost soupy. It tasted  better when I put the lime. We were very hungry but this is one of the only times I cosodered sending back an order. The thai basil on Tempe in comparison does pad thai better.

She adjusted our tables after I put two of them together and one of them wasn't leveled. She got on her knees and adjusted each table leg down to the correct size.  The menu had plenty of items to choose from. I don't think I've ever seen that many curry options. I ended up getting the red curry tofu and told them to make it really spicy.  It tasted amazing! There was a few beverages I wanted to try but didn't get a chance to order them. I'll try the mango smoothie and Thai iced tea next time. I'm hoping the mango smoothie is similar to the mango lassi at Indian restaurants. My fiance had allergies she didn't mention to the server such as peanuts and tofu. When we got our plates her dish had tofu in it and the server exchanged it without giving us a hassle. Later on she realized her sauce had peanuts in it and that was replaced as well without any issues. We had a great experience and will be coming back. The restaurant looks really nice and clean. If you want Thai food and you're in the area this place is an easy choice and no brainer.",

I'm not a big water drinker, so I ordered a beer. :)  Ordered the red Thai curry with lamb.  Ordered it \"Thai spicy,\" but I've had hotter.  Still, delicious!  The coconut curry sauce was excellent--on par with a delicious bisque.   Price was nice. Just under $20 for dinner and drinks.  I'll come back.",

I do have a qualm or two with the food, it was really heavy on the oil and having a love of Thai food it was not what I was used to at all. I'm used to chicken satay not being greasy but my napkin was filled with grease after just eating a piece (and no that was without peanut sauce). I had the spicy noodles medium which had a great spice but was also drenched in oil. There also were not a ton of veggies in it which I am used to but still good even though the next morning my husband and I paid for the amount of oil in the food.   The waitstaff leaves a lot to be desired - really nice folks but slow and they don't listen all that well. My husband asked for sweetener for his tea 4 times and still never got it. The table next to us )who was seated after us) got their food sooner and it was an epically long wait for the check. Is eat there again in a pinch but I'd try something else having the option.",

Other than that, I've had good dishes here--pad see ew is the best I've had. I'd be a bigger fan if I hadn't found meat in my food once here after ordering a vegetarian dish. Made me wonder how well they cleaned their grill. Still...I go back for the Mee Grob!",

A very small side salad with Thai vinaigrette dressing was put on my table, as soon as I sat down, along with the menu. The lunch menu is a single laminated sheet, listing popular dishes & drinks. Once ordered, the lunch dish was brought out quickly.   The Pad Thai with pork I had was pretty typical. Its portion size was just right.

I headed South on Central and was looking for the Thai place on Adams and Central (apparently there are more than one there too) anyway I forgot at that point you are on 1st. Well I was parked and the place looked nice so I ate here. I was seated and given the lunch menu. They promptly brought out a glass of water, silverware and a cup of broth soup. The menu was pretty typical Thai Lunch Specials for here. I noticed the BBQ Pork and that sounded good so I decided to give that a try. The soup was mostly broth but it was tasty and just the right temperature. I was surprised when they brought out the order what looked like two thin sliced pork chops on a bed of greens (Cabbage...) a pile of white rice a Spring roll and two cups of sauce. I tried the spring roll first because I am a huge fan of them. I was instantly disappointed. It was not only room temperature but it lacked much of any filling inside. The dipping sauce was ok but it would have been nice if they had some hot mustard on the table to add a bit to it. Next I cut up some of the pork and dipped it in the BBQ sauce. All was forgiven. This was very good, cooked properly and very tasty. The service was very good and the price was certainly fair. It is not one of the best Thai places in Phoenix, but it is very good and I will be back again.",

The tables and chairs are so close together, you feel as if they stole the design out of a French restaurant playbook. We visited at high noon, their busy hour. We were seated right away, poured water and 15 minutes went by before someone came to take our order. Another 20 minutes progressed before 2 out of 3 meals were served to us. 10 minutes later, we were able to flag down a waitress to inquire about the 3rd meal. They left to get it and came back with a different meal, stating they forgot to make it so try this alternative instead. Meanwhile, the fan above us sat motionless (much like the wait staff). We asked if they could turn it on, they said yes but did not turn it on. Our drink cups were empty half way through a spicy meal. Finally, a waitress can by to fill them... half way. Strange I thought, why fill a glass only half way? The bill came quite timely. Processing my card took another 10 minutes. Overall, the food was quite tasteful. The wait staff looked harried (including some guy dressed in a Hawaiian shirt rushing 4 huge bags of ice into the back kitchen. All the time we were there, I noticed they seemed to be several steps behind. Patrons around us had a similar dismayed look on their faces. Hope they polish this aspect because the food was made well.",

I told myself I'll just ask for half the salt next time I order because I realize I'm sensitive to food. But when the waitress asked if I wanted a to-go box for nearly ALL the food left (I just picked) and I said, \"no thanks it was too salty for me!\" she gave me a puzzled look and had a weird power trip and tried to make me feel wrong for saying such a thing! She looked around with a face of sass and said, \"it's the same sauce we use on everything!\" I said, \"and it's too salty for ME, which is why I don't want to take it to go!\" She said, \"ok well maybe tell us not to put so much next time.\" Even though that's what I originally planned to do, bad customer service is never appreciated! Undecided if I'll return! I feel bad for writing such a poor review for the establishment when really just this waitress should check her attitude before going to work!",

The Singha beer was excellent and everyone liked their food OK- except for me. I ordered the chicken satay off the appetizer menu (basically the most americanized thing that I could get), and the chicken was undercooked. Like, super pink. We hailed the waitress, she apologized and promptly took my plate to send it back. A few minutes later, after everyone else was basically done with their entrees, I got mine back. And guess what - it was still undercooked. Not as bright pink as the last time, but definitely tinged with pink. I ate whatever white parts that I could find, not wanting to tell the waiter a 2nd time. But I should have. I found it especially weird because   the restaurant was practically empty - what are the cooks doing back there if they are not checking for the pinkness of the poultry they are serving?

I love the simple stuff like Thai Basil with Chicken or fried rice. Ingredients taste fresh and have unique flavor. The service is good and there is indoor seating. They deliver sometimes, but if they are super busy, you may have to go pick it up. They serve a lot of dishes with Jasmine rice and theirs is perfectly made!

I don't usually do that either but in this case, the lettuce was brown and there were literally two pieces of tofu in the entire roll.  The Panang curry, my dish of choice, was average but my Thai pudding with sticky rice was great.  Wouldn't give this place a second chance but the staff was friendly to say the least.",

We've been to two other Thai basil locations and have had nice experiences each time so we decided to take a trip downtown to try out your location yesterday, July 3.. We first checked Google maps, then your website to confirm the hours and all said that you were open... I tried calling with a question, a few times but there was no answer (we figured you were just busy!) AND the outgoing voicemail message ALSO said that you were open... Likewise, there was NO indication on your Facebook page that anything was different about your hours this weekend... So we headed downtown, found some parking and PAID for parking then walked over to the restaurant... As we got near we could see there were no lights on, and when we came up to the door there was a simple paper sign stating that you were closed for the holiday weekend (July 2-4)!!  REALLY?!?!!  You could have made a little more effort to let that be known!!  We chose your restaurant over other restaurants, we were both very hungry and looking forward to try you out, SPENDING OUR TIME AND OUR MONEY TO GIVE YOU OUR BUSINESS, only to be greeted with a simple paper sign stating that you were closed for the weekend.  I hope that you will take notice and have more consideration for your potential future customers... DISAPPOINTING :(",

The people were attentive and really nice. They came to fill up my water frequently and came occasionally to check up.   They didn't have happy hour. I would recommend it.

The Moscow mule tastes great and was served in a traditional cup. The tempura was good but it took forever to be served. We went at a time when there was not too much crowd, hence we were really not sure why it would take that much time. But overall good food served here.  We definitely recommend this to other!

Noticed this was a \"signature\" Thai basil, so I wanted to try it one day.  I expected it to be better than the normal Thai Basil locations which are usually pretty good.  Walked in, sat down, put an order in for Pad See Ew with beef to go. Was excited and couldn't wait to dig in when I got back to the office.  First impression, the food looked, inadequate.  Didn't see enough noodles.  Took a bite, and the beef was very chewy, and the flavors were sub par - heavy on the sweet side which I did not expect.  Was starving so ate the little portion and finished with a disappointed and unfulfilled feeling and a bad after taste.  It's the worst experience I've had recently.  I have to assume that every Thai Basil is run completely independently.  This location ruins the brand.  Will go to the other locations but never back to this one.",

It was pretty busy and there was just one girl working the bar/ cash register/ drinks/ and taking orders. I must say she did a very good job at servicing everyone in a timely manor. I ordered the tofu pad Thai- medium. Medium = HOT. I ordered extra limes to help with the heat. So if you like hot but also like to be able to enjoy the flavor then order mild. My Hubby ordered Thai BBQ chicken and it was not spicy at all. We also had the fresh rolls with peanut sauce. They were excellent!",

    "text": "Update - Have become a regular and love the Cashew Chicken.  Good service and great for take out.  ----- So first time to any of the Thai Basil's around the valley.  It's a nice downtown location on Adams and Central.  I grabbed my order to go, but they had a good happy hour special that I didn't get to take advantage of since it was take out.  There was a bottle of Mekhong sitting on the bar, which sounds like a spiced rum, and the special was the Mekhong Ginger Lime Long-Tail.  Will try next time.  As for the food, the Cashew Nut had a rather zesty flavor especially on the backend, but I ordered it medium spicy and it fell way short.  The over all tast was good and comes with rice.  But the Pad Thai, I think they need to go back to the drawing board.  Very bland and didn't really activate the palette at all.  Almost like they only used half the seasonings.  It did have mushrooms, green beans, carrots, cabbage, and maybe some bean sprouts on the plus side.  Portion size was large, but really need to double down on the seasoning and spices for that large of a portion.  The service was very friendly and accommodating while the decor was inviting.  I'll definitely give it another try, but shoot for something a little more exotic like a curry or drunken noodle.  Always willing to give a second chance.",

When you call for takeout, they remind you of which location you're calling. I like that because some people are idiots and will probably go to the other one. I loooooooove the curried noodle dish. I've eaten it in the restaurant and ordered it for takeout. The service is super friendly and the place itself is really nice.  Call ahead before going, though. I drove down there one night after checking their hours and they were closed. Who does that????? That's the main reason I'm worried about this place staying open. It gets a good lunch crowd, but they need to work on dinner, too. Prices are reasonable and on par with the 87 other Thai places Downtown.",

The food itself was slightly disappointing. It took about 10 minutes after I ordered. Presentation on takeout was awful. The various vegetables were nice, but the noodles were unevenly goopy. I had a level 3/5 spiciness, but it was really mild. The beef was bland and the texture wasn't good.  I wouldn't order any noodle dish or anything with beef from them.

The service, once again was excellent. I was greeted at the door and offered a table, brought water and a salad within 3 mins.   I tried a new dish based on Yelp reviews: Pad See Ew. The dish was good but not great. I think my issue was with the sauce: it was rather bland.  Also the noodles were so roughly chopped that the dish looked like a hot mess. It had about 3 ounces of beef, three small broccoli spears and a few carrots and onions mixed in as well.   Again, good tasting but not great. All told it came to $9.76 plus tip.   Another visit, 2 years later. Arrived at 1:15 on a Monday afternoon in January. Eight full tables. I got the Pad Thai lunch special with beef. It came with a very flavorful broth soup, a veggie egg roll which was forgettable plus the entree, which came to $10.05 plus tip   The Pad Thai was thrown together from the various components:  the rice noodles and tofu were premixed and then the beef, bean sprouts, spices and peanuts were poorly added. I gave them a 'pass' on that because it was a lunch special which needed to be quick.   The cleaning dude was a bit annoying. He wiped down the entire restaurant during service, including the windows just inches from the other diners. Also, all the cleaning supplies were kept in the men's room, including the mop bucket, all cleaning fluids and backup paper products.   Frustrating.",

    "text": "Vegan review: I've eaten at various Thai Basil locations previously, including this one, and have asked if the curries are veg/vegan and been told yes. On my most recent visit, the server checked with the cook (thankfully) and confirmed that the curries have fish sauce, but the stir fries other than pad Thai would be entirely plant-based if ordered with tofu/veggies. I've pretty much given up getting Thai curry at most places now except for Chon Thai, which goes out of its way to make sure the curries are vegetarian/free of any seafood ingredients. I wasn't too hungry anyway, so I just ordered the fresh rolls with no shrimp.  The fresh rolls were a disappointment. They were mostly iceberg lettuce with a bit of unflavored, uncooked tofu. The sauce wasn't what I'd consider to be a peanut sauce - it was more of a thick sweet and sour sauce with crushed peanuts on top. I won't be ordering them again. I've had the red curry and the panang before and liked them, but didn't realize I was eating fish sauce.  My dining companions got a few items that were vegan and looked good -  both were stir fried noodle dishes with tofu but I don't remember what they were called. I think one was the Pad See Ew and the other was the silver noodles but am not certain. My friends said they were okay but not great.  Service was prompt and friendly - no issues. In short - it's an okay place in a pinch, but nothing to go out of your way for.",

One ordered pad see ew and thought it was too sweet.  I loved my Thai ice tea.  Our little kid ordered pad Thai and this is the first was saw an orange colored pad Thai and it tasted very sweet.  The other kid loved his chow mein. My husband ordered moderate spicy yellow curry but it was too spicy for him,  while the rest of us ordered mild. We visited the restroom and a mopping bucket was in front of the restroom door.  Personally I love what I ordered.  Worth a try!",

Overall it was good but highly recommend the pad Thai with shrimp.  This is a small place. No real bartender to make real mixed drinks. The house wine ( Chardonnay)wasn't very good either. Reasonably priced. Overall just ok.",

We were greeted promptly and we'll attended to poo ur entire experience. The staff wasn't very well versed on the drink menu, but that was fine! They actually had a pretty extensive drink menu compared to other authentic thai places.  We ordered the combination appetizer plate to share. This had some sort of chicken skewers, fried tofu, egg rolls, wontons and sweet potato pancakes with a variety of dipping sauces. Everything was pretty good, but the variety of hor dourves was really what made it great!  I ordered the thai green curry with tofu and my fiancee had the chicken pad thai. Both hot, but not thai hot (which I always assume is code word for pain). My curry was fabulous. Creamy and flavorful only made better by the hearty serving of vegetables and steamed tofu (my fav) swimming in it. C was very pleased with his pad thai and we both cleaned our plates, even though the servings were quite generous. I would absolutely recommend it and return myself!",

We called a day in advance to reserve for 24 people and even confirmed the reservation again.  Our reservation was set for 7pm on 1/20/018. We arrived early at 645pm to ensure we would be seated. However, when we arrived we were informed by Rambo very nonchalantly that he gave our seating away.  He was unapologetic and seemed to really not care as he was more concerned about the others he could seat at the smaller and fewer tables that were available.  If I could give this restaurant a ZERO star.",

Other restaurants I've tried their coconut soup was typically bland, but at Thai Bail this soup would perfectly describe what thai food is. Every spoonful is bursting with bold delicious flavors such as lemon grass, cilantro, coconut milk, and other Thai spices.  I normally order mild or with a little spice which why others has told me my soup is bland but at Thai Basil that isn't an excuse, it was very delicious and did not disappoint.",

I will defiantly want to hit this place up before any event at chase field or if the suns are ever decent enough to see.   My first visit I did an sweet and sour chicken with a side of rice. Huge portion that last most of dinner and most of lunch the next day. Next time was loosing my pad Thai virginity. Now I didn't study abroad for 6 weeks in some god awful green peace program on Thailand...so I am not an authority on if this is \"authentic\".....but honestly, if you are hungry and like tasty goodness then this place will make you happy. So drop the cartel coffee and your thrift store copy of \"animal farm\" and just eat.   Additionally, the main waitress has remembers when we come in and insists we sit at \"our table\". Cute as hell.",

With each dish, they ask what level of spice you prefer and what type of meat.  If you're sensitive to spicy foods, just choose no spice and you'll still get a flavorful dish.  We tried the Pad-See-Ew (with no spice), Red Curry (w/ medium spice), Curry Noodles (w/ mild spice), and Drunken Noodles (w/ medium spice) all with chicken.  Highly recommend the curry dishes.  They're soupy, warm, flavorful, and just all-around delicious. We will definitely return to Thai Basil on our next visit to Phoenix.",

It was around 1pm and pretty busy, full of people that work in the surrounding area, I assume. I was quickly given a table, and then quickly rushed into ordering.   I went with Number 13, Panang Curry. It came with salad and a veggie egg roll. It's a great deal if you just want to fill your stomach, not really caring about quality or taste. Everything seemed a little watered down. For example, the sauce that comes for the egg roll seems like they added water, or a simple syrup type thing. The curry it self wasn't very tasty, just heavily spiced.   Everything was just kind of disappointing. I did like that my water glass was pretty much always full, but that was the best part.",

You'll be rushed in and out, but that's the hallmark of a lunch joint that turns tables and fills tummies. While you're seated, you will notice that the decor is a little nicer than your typical hole-in-the-wall lunch spot, but the prices scream \"nice find!\" With lunch entrees ranging from $7.99 to $9.99, and including one spring roll and soup (salad in summer), you won't be disappointed. The quantity of food is certainly plentiful, but the service isn't particularly engaging or inspiring.  Side items are cheap, ranging from $1 to $2 for various rice sides in case the quantity the comes with your lunch entree isn't enough. Thai Basil offers the full gamut of curries, stir-fry dishes, and noodle items that you would expect. I didn't notice anything on the menu indicating what dishes were designed to be spicier than others. Y'all know that they call me Spice Fiend for a reason! On the opposite hand, if you're very averse or sensitive to spice, you may want to assert mild.   Although I insisted that my Eggplant Garlic Chicken be prepared \"Thai Hot,\" it was anything but, while one of my coworkers specified \"extra mild\" for her Pad Thai and intimated that it was barely edible due to the heat. Different strokes for different folks!  All in all, I'm glad that my local friend led us here for a quick and tasty lunch that was friendly to both wallet and to palate. It's hard to find a lunch for less than $10 that is truly satisfying and filling, while still being freshly-prepared and brought to your table!",

It was pretty comical but there were 4 of us having wine so it was the economical thing to do.   Our table of 5 split a few starters (potstickers, spring rolls, and fried shrimp & vegetables) that seemed like frozen appetizers they popped in a fryer. It all tasted good but nothing special.  Pad thai at level 3 was pretty darn good and perfectly spiced for me. Everyone else seemed to enjoy their meals (green curry, seafood combination, etc.)  Overall good experience but nothing I'd go out of my way for.

Food, was delicous! I had the papaya salad. First time trying it out. Asked for it medium heat. It had all the staples of thai cusine sour, sweet, salty, bitter and spicy. It had great bite in both heat and texture. The papaya was shredded like noodles. Zesty lime, jalapeno, thai chile. Wow!  The pad thai too, medium heat. Just remember that when you order it, it only comes with tofu. If you want an additional protein like: chicken, shrimp, etc. You need to ask for it. It comes with a lime wedge, spring onions and peanuts on the side. It had great sauce coverage. It had the great flavors of sour, sweet, and spicy. Delicious!  Price was great. Between me and my husband. The two plates mentioned above with thai tea about $30ish with taxes not including tip. Not bad.  We will surely be back.",

Fresh green beans, just the right amount of spice (I got a 3,  but probably will get a 4 next time). The service was great, never had to ask for a refill on water and the jasmine tea paired perfectly with the food. My friend had the green curry, which he liked as well.  I'm actually heading their for lunch today since I'm downtown for jury duty. Great place to eat downtown.",

    "text": "Yummy and fast lunch for a good price  Stopped in for some Thai for lunch.  This place is across from the Wells Fargo building and gets a good business crowd.  Very friendly young people took our order and bussed the table.  Did a good job of keeping drinks filled throughout the meal.  I also liked that they made sure I wanted real spiciness for my meal. So many restaurants are timid with the heat.  Maybe I looked non-pale enough that they believed I could handle it.    An \"adult\" came and served us our meal.  Excellent curry and noodle dishes.  And the spice was there as desired in my dish-- just the right level to give some heat while not totally overpowering the flavors.  Eggroll and soup were only okay, though.  My associate and I came away thinking the service, value, speed, and food were worth the visit.  We'll stop by, again.",
