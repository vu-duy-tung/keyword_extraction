Even when it's really busy, we have amazing service and we come so often, the waitress knows my boyfriend's order- I like variety and do a different burger every week. My favorites are the Juicy Lucy-fur, Rocky Point and the Buffalo Chicken Sandwich. It's an extra $2 to substitute chips with French fries, so I wish the French fries portion was a little larger, but the food always tastes amazing! Never had issues with my burgers being over or under cooked! Definitely recommend going on a Thursday night at 8:30 for trivia- it makes a great date night and you can win a gift card if you win!",

    "text": "This is an extremely average restaurant. I got the Arizona burger(?) I think. It had guacamole, pickles, sour cream, and jalapenos. It was pretty much what I would expect from any chain burger place. Nothing super special. My meat was a little dry and not medium well at all. I got it on a pretzel bun which was pretty hecking awesome! Couldn't tell you if it was freshly made or not. Either way it was warm and really good.   I really don't like the chips they give you. They were fried fresh and that's for sure. But they had no seasoning on them. I couldn't find any salt on the table for them. I really would have preferred fries. The chips just don't go with the burgers at all.   But the kicker was the service. Carly was great. Dude with the bandaid on his face was horrible. He brought out my food and literally dropped it in front of me. Then walked away angrily. Like sorry for eating here I guess???   Also, do you really need every inch of wall covered in TVs that are all of the same chanel? Could we hang them higher than 6 feet off the ground? I hit my head on like 4 of them",

The staff was friendly and very attentive.   For food we ordered the mozzarella sticks for appetizer and the cheese was not melted. When you order mozzarella sticks, you expect the cheese to be oozing out when you take a bite. They still might be trying to figure out their cook times since they just opened. My husband ordered the Juicy Lucy burger with fries, which was in fact was not a not so juicy burger patty. I did like the seasoning on his fries though. I ordered the California Ruben Sandwich (added bacon) with sweet tots. The bread had way too much butter on the sandwich, I felt like it left a coating in my mouth, so I didn't finish it. If you order bacon, ask them to make it crispy because my bacon was very limpy.   I don't think I will be returning for lunch or dinner, but I will be back for drinks and watching sports on the amazing selection of tvs they have.",

The burger is so thick, I got it medium. It was nice and juicy and made a pool of juice in the bottom bun so I couldn't eat the whole bun. The Mac n cheese was so good and it was my first time having a Mac n cheese burger. It had tomatoes and bacon but the bacon was lost in the sandwich.  The wings were also good and a decent size! They were nice and saucy like I like them! Juicy wings of perfection! They played a lot of 80s retro music including dancing queen and the YMCA song from the village people. It's like I'm at a gay bar! I like the placemats that you can color...wait were those for kids? My bad!!!",

    "text": "Despite the explosion of Cold Beers & Cheeseburgers (aka CBC) locations throughout the valley and elsewhere, I actually had yet to set foot in a CBC location until today.  Scottsdale-based Square One Concepts (proprietors of other valley restaurants such as Wasted Grain and Bourbon & Bones) is the brainchild behind this growing chain of burger joints (10 strong as of when I write this) which have received mixed reviews from those I've spoken to.  My Dad wanted a good burger for lunch on Memorial Day and it just so happened that CBC's central Phoenix location was open nearby so off we went to satisfy our curiosity (and hopefully a burger craving).  The central Phoenix location sits along 7th Street between Missouri and Bethany Home Road, alongside a large and growing list of new restaurants lining this stretch of the valley.  Burger joints are a pretty easy find in CenPho so one would think CBC would need to offer something unique to survive in this saturated market.  CBC's answer?  Variety.  Both the food and beverage menus are impressively extensive with about two dozen burger options (including the ability to build your own), plus upwards of 100 beers to choose from.  And that doesn't even account for the lengthy wine and cocktail options.  Or the hot dog, sandwich, or appetizer options.  Seriously, reading through this long menu is tantamount to reading those long binder menus at the Cheesecake Factory.  And while it may seem a bit overwhelming, CBC doesn't veer too far from the types of items you would likely expect to see at a sports bar setup.  There's just a lot more of them to choose from than say a Zipp's or a Twin Peaks.  Anyhow, I started off with a Scottsdale Blonde Ale for my beer (one of about 20 AZ produced microbrews on the menu).  After looking up and down at the burger menu, my eyes stopped and transfixed on one burger in particular.  The Pastrami Burger.  Pastami, swiss cheese, coleslaw, and thousand island dressing atop a 1/2 pound burger patty and sandwiched between a toasted artisan bun.  Came with a side of twice cooked lightly seasoned potato chips.  Total cost for the food, beer, tax and tip came to about $28.  I was actually really pleased with the bun they used as it held together just fine despite the inevitable mess a piled high burger like this can make.  The burger was also delicious, though as a point of comparison, I would give valley favorite Rocket Burger the edge in the Pastrami Burger pecking order.  Rocket's version has more meat and tastes just as good for a cheaper price.  Still, I'd give CBC's version pretty high marks for their version.  I've seen some Yelpers state that this location has bad servers.  We experienced nothing of the sort as our server was friendly, attentive, and efficient.  I won't disagree that the prices for the food here are pretty steep compared to most sports bars and thus why I can't give this place a 5 star rating.  But taken as a whole, I was impressed with the food I had, the variety of options to choose from, the stellar sports bar setup with plenty of TVs for big game days, and with the staff that took care of us.  You can find plenty of other cheaper sports bar options in CenPho and around the valley.  But during happy hour and on game days, CBC might very well become one of my go to's.",

First, it's setup with TVs everywhere with every sporting event you can imagine playing. Next, huge bar with an enormous beer selection - a must have if \"beer\" is in your title. Then several unique appetizers, we had the buffalo chicken tot-chos (like nachos) and our friends got the regular tot-chos = both unique and tasty! The burgers selection was vast, but the also have sandwiches and a mac & cheese section on the menu! I got the CB & CB burger, grilled onion gruyere cheese - it was gooey and delicious. I really enjoyed it! Plus they have the biggest pacman in the world - so fun to play!",

We asked for a extra slice of pickle but what came were four pickle slices. Potatoes chips also came but were cold and greasy. Our first clue should have been we arrived at the height of lunch hour and the place was virtually empty.

Waitress only stopped by maybe twice in the hour I was here with friends and family. Once to take a drink order and food, and the second to ask if \"the food was ok?\" Had to flag down the waitress a few times with an incorrect order, water refills, and finally the check. For as large as this place is you would think they would staff plenty of waitresses. Correction. Waitresses found. They prefer to hang at the hostess stand vs. make their rounds. Managers also are pretty sparse. Looks like they prefer the patio drinking sugar free Red Bull. To be honest. Most of the staff look unhappy to be there.",

The place was very loud at first, but I got used to the noice after a while. I ordered a custom burger which immediately became my favorite. I will definitely be back soon. Also, I would like to add that our waitress was fantastic. Friendly, informative and very attentive. I highly recommend this place!   P.S.  A couple of tables from us there was a family with a young 11ish boy eating a burger, therefore, even though this place has a bar and serves alcohol, I saw a child eating a burger.  Also, I would like to mention that we did not have any alcoholic beverages, therefore, I cannot comment on the beer quality.",

You can build your own burger and they have a wide range of different add on's. I'd avoid the gluten free bun because it falls apart easily but the second time I went I tried the pretzel bun and it was phenomenal. Different variety of sides you can choose from fries, to salad, to mac n cheese etc. Definitely a great spot to watch games if your a sports fan. Loved the experience overall.",

We both said no, she turned around and walked away without saying anything. We wanted to order a appetizer. It she walked away. She came back with 2 waters sat them on the table and walked away again without saying a word. When she cam back we both ordered a cheeseburger the same. Ay so we did not make her mad or confuse the server.  After a while she brought our food too us. I asked for the check which she promptly brought to the table without a word. Later the Manger \"Mark\" came by the table to ask how were we doing. I told him I like the restaurant if I would make a comment on yelp about the server we had. Very poor service",

Sad part is was inside for approximately 15 minutes and only the hostess provided my fiance and I water after seating us promptly. We looked over the menu and decided on a B.Y.O.M.C and a Hangover burger. We waited patiently for a waitress to great us, after about 5 minutes we started to get irritated. We decided we would wait about another 5 minutes and in this time frame multiple waitresses had walked by chitchatting but never stopped at our table or greeted us. Others where seated by the hostess as well and a waitress came right to them and greeted them. The total time spent inside was about 15 minutes and we decided that was enough and left. On the way out the manager happened to be by the door and I told him what had happened, he did offer to have something made to go but my fiance and I where tired of waiting already (we do appreciate the kind gesture). I hope when we return the issue is fixed, until then I will be leaving Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers one star.",

I believe they use their extensive toppings and odd concoctions to distract from a purely average hamburger. It was not the worst food I've ever eaten, but nothing fantastic. With a name like this, you really should perfect the very food you're named after. It's quite pricey, and any substitution is upward of two or three dollars.   As far as the service went, again, nothing to write home about. I presume they were quite busy due to patrons going to watch a fight. This is fine, and expected on a Saturday night; however, there were plenty of open tables and booths. Still, we were crammed between a door and large opening to the patio. It was extremely uncomfortable and highly unnecessary. The food and drinks took quite a while to be dropped off, and nothing was very hot.  All in all, I'd save yourself the time and money. You can get better food, better service and a cheaper bill elsewhere.",

We had an amazing waitress who was patient with us because we needed time figuring out which delicious burgers to get. We got wings and mozzarella sticks for appetizers. I ordered a bacon PB&J burger which I've never had in my life....amazing. Just unbelievably yummy which I hoped for and didn't expect to enjoy as much as I did! My son got the Arizona burger he said he loved but couldn't finish...these burgers are big! I will recommend this place and will go back.",

I had the 1000 island burger that comes with cheese, lettuce, 1000 island dressing, and pickles. SUPER tasty!   My friend had the bacon blue burger that came with bacon, blue cheese, avocado, and caramelized onions! It was huuuuge and looked really good as well.   The menu is pricey, but these patties are really big and well worth it!   Only con: all burgers come with chips and it costs two dollars to sub another side such as fries, even though they're the same price.....  Ps- lots of gluten free options!",

The hostess recognized we were wearing team apparel and made sure we sat by a television with a perfect view of the game we wanted to watch. The beer selection was very extensive as well as their list of unique cocktails. Their Bloody Mary bar was a disappointment, but the rest of the alcohol menu made up for it. We only purchased the chicken tenders appetizer to split but the portions were plentiful and enough for the both of us. I am hoping to go back soon, try a burger and upgrade this review to 5 stars!",

There were some other customers that had not been seated yet blocking the view of the tv standing right in front of our table. I tried to ask those customers to just step out of the way. They didn't listen. There were some staff members standing close to the table. Well the hostess (the girl with black hair and her right arm tattooed) responded when I called for her attention. I said these customers are standing in front of our table and we are trying to watch the game. Staring at me when I said that she rolled her eyes and turned away. Great customer service. Glad she thinks it's okay to treat a paying customer that way. I chose to watch the Sunday football at this place and I get treated this way. If you ask me my request to enjoy my time here was not as important as her need to socialize with her coworkers... hope management will talk to this woman about her lack of customer service and that maybe her priority should be her job.   I would like to say though our waitress was wonderful.   Just wish my experience her wasn't ruined by this woman's total rudeness!",

We had great service from Tiara we met two managers both very nice. We had two appetizers they were tasty liked those. The husband had a PB and J burger which he really liked. I had a burger that was supposed to have truffles and yummy cheese bacon etc... it was less than satisfying and when it comes with a price tag close to 16 bucks it should be like mind blowing good.  They took the cost of the burger off without saying a word very nice.  They had only one bottle of the beer I was drinking a bit odd for a Saturday. I would come back for beer and appetizers especially if there was a good event on. The burgers meh!!",

After another long wait we finally got our burgers. We waited over an hour and 10 minutes for our food in a restaurant that was practically empty. We were told by our waitress that the manager would do something for us. BIG DEAL. She gave us $5.00 off our $50.00 meal. She gave us a coupon for $5 dollars off on our next visit. That meant nothing because we will NEVER be back. Something is terribly wrong with this restaurant. We heard our waitress asking other tables \"Not to hate her.\" Poor thing.

Suggestions for this new establishment:  --Let people order 2 and 4 oz beer samples (and charge for those), like half glasses of wine. --Offer make your own flights. --Put items on the plate that the menu says will be there --Offer better sides --Advertise your lettuce wrapped sandwiches better, put it right on the menu --Educate your wait staff better --Chuck the disgusting brown rice and black bean veggie burger, which are just punishment to vegetarians.  No vegetarian wants a starch patty served on a bun (starch on starch). --Offer more sauces at the table.  Our server was a bit clueless.  She didn't know the difference between black and green tea.  She offered no alternative when someone in our group wanted to try some beer but didn't want a full pint, even though the restaurant offers flights.  My sandwich had almost none of the advertised sauce on it and was dry and inedible.  My sisters' veggie burger was smothered in a sweet terriyaki sauce that she said was gross (so the sandwich was sweet rice and beans terriyaki on a bun).  No one came by to offer drink refills until after our check came.  The joint has cement-like floors and is very very loud.  You have to shout to hear each other... just too many minuses to come back.  Glad you're crowded and doing well, but we won't be coming back and chance a repeat on the food or service.",

I see people complaining about slow service or inattentive managers, or even how expensive the food it. I spent $13 on a well thought out, well cooked, great tasting sandwich. I give credit to places that serve me menu items I can't easily make at home myself without making a mess or having to clean up a bunch. There a plenty of places where you pretty much get a burger and a bun and not much more for 8 to 10 bucks. As for the kind of service my two servers where great but you know what? They are people like you and me. They have good days and bad days. You have some that work their a** off to serve you and others who just need a paycheck. I am not excusing poor service but to say any given place is bad based on one less than perfect day is pretty short sited in my opinion. I only say that because I see reviews where they say I come here a lot but TODAY it sucked so I give it 3 stars. What about all the good days? Just my opinion",

If you have any intentions of actually talking with people at your table this is not the place to go for dinner. The wait staff is always friendly, always slow and hard to find once you have received your food. The menu looks amazing and the burgers/sandwiches mediocre at best. It seems like the cook staff has a problem with timing a table foods to be ready all at the same time. Cold and undercooked and other meals hot to burnt. Wrong burger delivered and it took at least another 10 minutes to get the correct burger(in the meantime the rest of us have eaten) and the new burger was close to raw. The tv's are great if you don't care to hear anything and there is a large selection of rather standard beers(but they are cold).

I'm miserable many days of my life at my job, but still, I have to show up and appear to give some sort of interest.  Ordered the tot chos, two burgers medium, and two sodas.   The waitress took our orders, delivered our drinks, and that was the last we saw her until she dropped off the check.   No \"how's your meal\", no refills on the drinks.   The wait staff just walked by staring at our empty cups and kept on walking if you tried to stop them.  The tater tots were cold and old, but at least the chili sauce and cheese sauce were warm.  The burgers were meh.  One was well done, the other was raw.  Not rare, but brown on the outside, red, white and stringy raw on the inside.  The bun was stale as well.  The best part of the meal was the potato chips (fortunately I did not spend the extra $3. for a side of fries as a substitute).  For the $50. we spent on dinner, was definitely not worth it.  If you want sub par service or  mediocre cafeteria food, this is your place.  Definitely won't come back, especially with all the other edible options in close proximity.",

By the look on her face she was not happy to be there.  I then told her it took me over 40 minutes to place my order because the line was busy.  She told me it was an issue with my phone and that they had been getting calls.  Hard to believe.  I thanked her for being rude and paid my bill.  $19. for a mediocre French dip and poor service as well. I don't understand how any owner would allow this behavior not if they want return customers.

    "text": "I was so looking forward to trying this new place in central Phoenix. I finally had the opportunity this past Saturday. Man, I was highly disappointed! I ordered the BLT. When I first picked it up, my bread literally disintegrated and fell apart. The crusts came off and where my thumb barely held the bread, that spot came apart too. It was as if I punctured my thumb through the bread intentionally. The bread was stale, dry and old...hence why it fell apart. I will say the bacon tasted great though. So I proceeded to have my bacon and tomato instead of a True BLT sandwich that I had ordered. When the waitress finally came back to check on us, I showed her the sandwich. She didn't apologize at all. She said she'd call a manager over. A manager came over a few minutes later and looked miserable as can be, like he didn't want to be there. No smile, no apology, nothing. I showed him what was left of my wannabe sandwich and he said he'd give me a slight discount on my bill. Pathetic resolution. For as many restaurants as there are on 7th Street and Central Phoenix, you would think he would want to keep my business and have me come back again. He proceeded to give me $5 off my bill. Whohoo. The BLT was I believe $11 plus the onion rings I ordered were another few bucks added on. So I basically paid way too much for 3 slices of tomato and about 5 strips of bacon. Try the BLT at The Garage down the street - you won't be disappointed. Furthermore, they serve what looks like homemade chips with their high cost plates. The chips that we received had no flavor, only the top chip had any seasoning salt on it and they tasted burnt. Nasty. If you order any other side, you're going to pay extra. We could have gone to many other burger places in the area and spent half as much as we did here and had a better meal. This place is not worth the hype. High costing food, drinks and the staff clearly doesn't care about their customers or retention. Save your money and go elsewhere. There are tons of restaurants in the area that are much better and the staff is more attentive and smiling.",

When our appetizer came out they were barley warm. Cheese sticks and truffle fries. My prime dip was very chewy and was ordered WITH OUT onions and came out with them on it. Was sent back and all they did was take them off and added more cheese. I found a small piece as I was eating it. That was a scan I hate onion and thought I was going to throw up  lol. My wife's burger was good but was over cooked. Very disappointing because I of the good reviews and wanted to find a place to celebrate mine and my wife's birthday. Not until February. We may try them again just not sure.",

Good burgers, and can do gluten free burgers and fries are also gluten free (no cross contamination) which is really rare and a huge bonus.  This time was terrible and we may not come back. We sat at our table for over an hour with no food (and a two year old). They eventually brought out the kids sliders about 45 minutes in. We never did get our food at the table...a bit over an hour in and food finally comes, to the table next to us who had arrived after us. I actually feel worse for the people on the other side who had been waiting even longer than us.   We finally got them to just pack it up for us to go. Apparently was an issue for everything coming out of the kitchen and had been that way for three hours. Yikes.   Still two stars cause of really good gluten-free non  gluten contaminated French fries.",

This is a sports bar that serves burgers and beer!!  What are they thinking?!  I am getting extremely annoyed over this disturbing trend in the area.  There is no purpose for Valet when the parking lot surrounds the restaurant.  Valet is for when parking is off site.  Why would the owners choose to make parking such a hassle?  I do not know anybody who prefers Valet.  Who wants to wait in line to park your car and then again to pick up your car.  I can only come to the conclusion that the owners care more about profit than making their customers happy.  That's a shame.  If more people would complain and refuse to do business at places that only have Valet maybe they would get the message.",

    "text": "I've been waiting for a long time to try this place after the rave reviews my east valley friends gave it.  It hurts me but I'm giving it one star and that is for the beer menu and because I can't give it no stars.  Our server was fine, not the worst I've had, far from the best.  I also tried to keep in mind that they just opened 5 days ago.  We started off with the pretzel and cheese, it was very plain and the cheese was cold. Ok, so I won't get that again, no big deal, we came for burgers anyway.    We ordered 3 burgers. 2 were med/well and one was med, we got two rare and one well done which was pretty much the opposite of what we ordered.  Besides being cooked wrong two were what we expected.  I did the unthinkable I guess, I asked to add cheese, minus the tomato and I wanted mayo on the side.  She asked if we wanted fries instead of chips, yes please.    Now my burger...I ordered a bacon cheeseburger which is about as simple as it gets. I got the wrong cheese, 2 slices of tomato and no mayo and my medium/well burger was so raw I could hear it moo.  My husband did have to go to flag our waitress down so I could tell her this was nothing that I ordered.  She came and offered to take mine back but because I was now over this place I just asked for the mayo so we could move on with our night.  Whatever, just a place we wouldn't come back to.  No big deal, there are plenty of restaurants in North Central to choose from.    Then the bill comes...we were all charged an additional $2 for the fries. I guess it does say this on the menu but if the server is asking if we want something INSTEAD then she should also mention it will cost you.  The thing that put me over the edge was the 50 cent charge for mayo.  Seriously?  That is a pretty common thing to put on a burger.  So let me get this right...You served me the entirely wrong burger and you add 50 cents for the one correct thing you didn't put on my plate until I asked again, after you knew you gave me the wrong food?    I'm disappointed that this place was not all that my friends have told me about. We won't be back and that makes me sad.",

The best times to go are during their happy hours because it's unlimited toppings. I built my own Mac and Cheese which was very delicious. Everyone else had cheese burgers which looked really good. Definitely a lot of food.  Our waitress was very patient and fast with us. I know having a large group like ours could be overwhelming but she handled us very well. Our drinks were always filled and our food came out promptly.  This place was pretty fun. They have a ton of TVs around with different channels and a giant Pac Man arcade machine.

Our service was timely and none of us felt that the drinks/food took too long.  I had the 1000 Island burger which was delicious. Both the regular and sweet potato tots were awesome!!  Everyone loved their meal and we didn't think that it was overpriced.  Two things they should consider: 1) They planted a large cacti right next to where bike parking is...definitely not the best planning as 2 people in our party stuck themselves with the thorns.  Need more areas to lock up bikes as well. 2)7th street is a really busy street!  I hope that the bars/restaurants in that area consider spear heading an effort to get a lighted crosswalk for people trying to run/bike back and forth to the different businesses!",

When I asked about a menu item the waitress answered abruptly and left quickly - I waived down the check after waiting 10 mins of her not returning to our table.

The \"Juicy Lucy\" was about twice the cost of the original (Matt's Bar, Minneapolis) and was fairly tasteless. The bun is much too big (thick) for the burger and the quality of the meat, even if it was terrific, could not get through. The chips and the Tater Tots were terrific.  Given the name, I expected a great deal more, especially flavor in the burger.  Will NOT repeat.",

The waitress then stated \"food ticket is up in line and will be out shortly.\" After this, did not see waitress for 32 minutes, then food arrived. By the way, the restaurant at this point was nearly empty.   Wasn't till my table asked a new waitress what's the status, then as the new waitress proceeded to the back, she came out with the food. As if the food had been just sitting there...   When our food arrived, deliberately asked for NO cheese and add onion (as waitress repeated when taking order/wrote down). When she took plate to the kitchen and brought plate back, it had no cheese, but was STILL missing onions. The bread was EXTREMELY burned that it cut the roof of my mouth.   The waitress to say the least was not attentive. When speaking with the manager, he could only really defend the bad service which put my family and I unease.   Will not return.",

I usually go to the ones in Old Town or NScottsdale and have never had any issues, everyone is usually super friendly. The food was great as expected but the attitude having waitress didn't mention that the French fries were an extra cost.. you don't want to know what her face looked like when I asked her to double check my tab. I didn't make a big deal about the couple dollar difference but it would've been nice to know and maybe I would've stuck with the chips had I known. I think this place can use a little staff development but other than that it's is very nice and the food is still great.  Another item to mention is the Valet.. you have to valet here so just beware.",

You will get to watch the game you want even on a busy Sunday, and I've always been able to find at least a seat or two at the bar.  Good beer selection, you can mix it up all day, though I do wish they had a few more specials. They do have a beer of the month special and $3 old styles if you're ballin' on a budget.  The food is good. They make a tasty burger, and there are a lot of choices. A tad expensive for a burger joint but I haven't been disappointed by the taste or portions.  Service is great at the bar, I cant speak for the wait staff as I haven't sat at a table.  Pretty solid sports bar overall. I would recommend edpecially to sports fans.",

Service- I sat at the bar ordered a beer which was the only thing good by the way. This place did not make me feel welcomed, especially from the bartender female. She passed me by a lot of times n finally I had to waive her down to say I'm ready to order. Keep in mind it's Monday and it's not busy at all. Not good service.   Food - I ordered the Mac n cheese burger cuz on other yelp reviews it looked so juicy n delicious. I got my burger n oh man was it one of the driest burgers, non- flavored burgers I have ever had. Bun was dry, meat was dry AND the Mac n cheese. Previous pic look good... fooled me. I give it a 0 rating due my experience. Place looks good though with all the TVs!",

The beer selection is phenomenal which immediately makes it a hit in my book, and it has a TON of TV's that are playing the sports I like. It's always very clean and the service has been good every time we have eaten here. Being that it is essentially a sports bar, I was pretty sure my fiancee wouldn't be a fan. The food however, is enough for her to tolerate my beer guzzling and sports watching ways. We go on Wednesday's for dinner where they have a Build Your Own burger with unlimited toppings off the sheet. Hook that burger up! The parmesan fries are really good, so are the buffalo chicken egg rolls and the buffalo chicken nachos are a huge plate and are very good. We are fans of Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers.",

Love Cold beer and Cheeseburgers best for dinner though! We had an AWESOME waitress that night who took great care of our table or 10 plus two kids. She was very attentive and provided excellent service. We tried a few appetizers- the veggie plate and the pretzel with cheese before happy hour ended. We each ordered individually. I got the ham club sandwich with fries. My date had the Juicy Lucifer and they really enjoyed the burger with onion rings as well. Overall we had a great experience here again. It is great for families or small groups etc. Parking isn't terrific but luckily they do offer valet!",

    "text": "I will NEVER patronize this establishment again. In the grand scheme of things, it probably doesn't even matter, but I want to forewarn others about how I was treated and express concern about the parking situation. I resent having to use the valet to park. I want to park my own car and even the valet will not allow this. If you have ever valeted your car and come out only to find the rims have been cheese grated, you have damage to your car, or things have been stolen from inside your car, you may also be reluctant to valet as well. We ended up parking in a \"To go\" parking spot and ran in for one drink. Within three minutes the server let us know that we would need to use the valet or our car was going to be towed. I asked to speak to the manager and \"Sean\" came over. I respectfully let him know we would be leaving, but I wanted to provide feedback about the parking situation. I noted that I do not want a valet to park my car for a variety of reasons and inquired where else I could park if I wanted to spend money in his restaurant. His answer...\"anywhere else.\" I don't know what that means. He then noted that if we didn't leave, the police be arriving to give us a parking ticket. A parking ticket? The last time I checked, the police do not issue parking tickets on private property. Sean was argumentative and repeatedly interrupted me. We then went down the street to Camp Social where there is NO valet. The manager there explained that bars use valets to cram cars into the lot and increase their revenue. They have contract with valet companies and do not want customers to park their own cars because then they cannot fit as many cars on the lot. Oh...and Rehab Burger, right around the corner has NO valet, has parking for days, and offers much tastier food in a much friendlier place.",

    "text": "CRAZY BAD EXPERIENCE....  Went Sat for my Birthday with 7 others and 2 children. The place was half empty and so the hostess said they got a table ready...and it was a high table, so with our 2 toddlers in our arms told them it wouldn't work. They wanted to stack high chairs, and we told them that is unsafe.   So they told us to wait til they got another table ready....45 minutes went by and so we asked if the table was almost ready. With the hostess on her phone and gossiping with other waitresses, she looked annoyed that we were asking her. She told us they're trying. ANOTHER 20 minutes went by and I asked again knowing there are booths open and told her. She said for us to hold on (while she's still on her phone). ANOTHER 15 minutes went by and my sister asked and the hostess told us it'd be another 45 minutes. So we had to leave because our kids were getting restless.  I'm not sure who manages this place, but they need to put their hostess in check. She only has ONE job. Coming from a restaurant background, this is COMPLETELY unacceptable. She said there are only 2 tables in the whole place that work with high chairs and they were taken. If that's the case, they should be the VERY LAST tables given to anybody that excludes that requirement.  Because we waited there almost an hour and a half without getting seated, we were unable to find a restaurant around without a long waiting time. So we had to call it a night and go home.   Thanks for ruining our evening.  I'm just glad we didn't spend $300 in your restaurant. That's the only good thing that came out of it.",

BUT, we went this past Sunday, and the waitress was sweet, but we waited a LONG time for our food. Mine was great, but my son's burger was ordered medium-rare, and came out so raw he couldn't eat it. Given your name, not getting that right would be a deal-breaker. more kitchen help? More practice on burger temperatures?? We're rooting for you!",

    "text": "I really want to like this place, but it always falls short every time we stop by. Tonight it was a toss up between CBCB and Culinary Dropout and we decided to grab some burgers. I ordered the BBQ bacon burger and asked for it to be cooked medium rare, with a side of tots. My tots were warm, but not hot, and my burger was burnt and dry. The manager offered to remake my food for free, but by the time he had come, everyone at my table had finished eating. In the end, I sent my food back and our check was comped. Our server was sincere about apologizing for the mishap. I appreciate the FOH staff trying to make things right, but we've given this place so many opportunities. They just don't execute well with the food. It seems that every time we've visited either our food is overcooked, something is missing, or the service is amiss. We all decided that we're not going to frequent this location any longer. Try stopping at the one in Old Town Scottsdale or Gilbert if you really want to come here.",

    "text": "They do indeed have a large selection of beers and burgers. Now on to everything else about this black hole, no soul, rather eat at home, copy cat crap hole.  The room is large and any wall space not dedicated to city code allotment for light and proper exits, is dedicated to the mighty poor resolution flat screen TVs. Let's just say there are 30 TV's, that means you get to see a nice variety of watchable events, right? Nope, you get to see 30 of the same game. Yet somehow I had to sit in a cantilevered fashion to see a tv at the right distance so that the images weren't distorted and pixilated.  Then there is the issue of general volume. The sea of flat screens stacked corner to corner provide perfectly flat sound reflecting surfaces to frame the irritating audible assault of what is an obnoxious mixture of mostly crowd noise from tvs competing the hysterical scream/laughs of the youthful and bubbly staff, who all seem to enjoy working with each other... so much so that after getting one drink, I was not asked nor responded to by our waitress Alyssa for the rest of the night. Until bringing us the check. That said, she was very nice and competent when we had her attention, as she wasn't even the worst or most blatantly apathetic. Attempted outsourcing to various other staff with repeated head nods, finger raises, smiles with a slight motion of an elementary style hand raising to politely ask: \"May I have another please?\"   The menu looks on par with the other trendy burger places in up scale central Phoenix, similar to Joe Midnight Run, Zinburger, Hopdoddy... Prices ranging from 10 -18 bucks for burgers and the standard sides. All my gleaning tells me that they are following he blueprint for those aformentioned trailblazing institutions, but doing it well and with large portions.  And finally, the joys of valet parking. I understand the need for valet at certain locations, especially when self parking is difficult. Go Green Valet, with their throw back outfits of white knit polos with pleated khaki shorts looked cute mimicking the buns inside the restaurant with their cool hair style. I likely would have been able to wipe the gel off the cars moon roof, had they not closed the valet drive. And by closing the valet, I don't mean physically by putting signs or cones up to discourage incoming 7th Street traffic. I mean just with the words \"we are full.\" The lot does not have another obvious exit, so the shock and obvious irritation of the valet that we going to have to pull forward to turn around was a little, not cute. It was an unfortunate pairing of circumstances, to drive down the street to Bashas and walk a block back and then only get a single glass if water, and a 12 oz bottle of 5 dollar woodchuck. This seems to be what a useful valet service would do for you, but instead they block out almost all on site parking, then don't have the staff to keep the place flowing.  The first visit is likely my last visit, fortunately the lack of service saved my about 30 dollars in food and drink orders, so that is a win on a certain level. Can't wait to see what this space will become next!",

The wings, which are actually drumettes, no flats , came in three flavors and I decided to get the classic buffalo which ended up not being hot at all, despite what the waitress had told me.  To my disapproval the wings also arrived at room temp.  Wings (used to ) generally come with celery which to me is strange because at some point in history we changed our standard and have lost carrots and celery as the standard pairing item.  The menu stated that the wings came with veggies, which is great because again, that is rare, but the veggies did not show when the wings were dropped off .  When I asked where the veggies were, the waitress said \" You have to ask for those, we do not just give them to you.\" Weird... the menu says it comes with veggies but you must ask.  Anyway, she brought them, and there were both carrots and celery, woo.  Why am I focusing so much on the veggies?! Because the veggies ended up being better than the wings...I have had way better wings.  I probably will not return, but give it a shot yourself and check it out.  The staff was friendly, which I think should be the norm and not considered anything out of the ordinary, but then again we ARE living in strange times...",

    "text": "Great environment to watch the game. Great Thursday night trivia spot (at least the one in Scottsdale used to be, if my memory serves me). Great big menu with lots of choices.  Here's my question: when you have good quality food, why overseason it? Had the Hangover Burger (jack cheese, sauteed onions, grilled tomato, bacon, fried egg) today while catching some football and a side of sweet potato tater tots. The burger was yum, but the eggs had some type of a Mrs. Dash seasoning that was saltier than a Scottsdale chick who just learned that the mimosas weren't bottomless, and the same went for the tots. Hoping to stick to more basics next time and see if this spot can't redeem itself to my tastebuds. It's called \"Cold Beer and Cheeseburgers\", for goodness sake...why wouldn't I want to like it?!",

    "text": "I'm giving 2 stars because the food was pretty good... my advice to management is not allow takeout orders if its \"too busy\" to put the order in or even put them together correctly. I placed an order for pickup and was told it would be ready at 6:30. SO I actually got there at 6:45 just in case. When I got there, I gave my name to the hostess and she \"put together\" my order and said thanks! I noticed the bag to be a little light (I ordered a total of 4 things) so I checked the bag and there was ONE burger in it.... so I go back up to the hostess and shes scrambling trying to find my order, finally does and tells me they havent started it yet and  \"sorry its busy\". I looked around, there was no wait, spots at the bar open, but whatever not the point. Finally come 7:15, some other girl brings me my bag, I count 4 boxes looked much better but I was fuming and ready to get home. I get home and my burger that was supposed to be a 1 pound burger, was not. So I wasted 5 bucks on that. There was tomatoes on my sandwich which I requested none, thankfully I'm not allergic. The pretzel was hard. I loved the wings tho, so like I said, the food was ok. I do takeout alot and this was super annoying. Like I said, if u cant handle your dine in clientele and takeout orders, then dont do them on the weekends when \"you're really busy, oops.\"",

The only thing I didn't appreciate this evening was that the waitress informed us she was leaving the check so whenever we were ready, but this was only 5 minutes after we got our food. Why would you have your servers do that? I had an alcohol beverage and was watching the football game, how do you know I didn't want another drink? We went even asked if we wanted another drink. Which I did but I felt like I was being rushed out of there so chose not to. The service was good up until that point. I hope this isn't a regular practice.",

My order came with a beer but only if I ordered one of the tasteless \"light\" versions of Bud, Coors, Michelob or some other obscenity.  I didn't want that crap! Hello, we're in Phoenix - micro brewery capital of AZ.  So, on top of a hot dog that was crap I had to pay for a beer I didn't want since the beer I did want was Kilt Lifter...yeah, a LOCAL company - imagine that! Buying local - CRAZY, I know.  Buddy asked me to try the burger and it was 95% salt!!! I mean damn! Way too much!!  Complained to manager who did nothing but say \"yeah, it depends on the cooks.  Sometimes you get good ones and sometimes you get morons who are to free with the salt\"  That's it! No \"I'm sorry, how can I make this a better experience for you?\"  Nothing.  So, I'm never going back and I recommend to ALL who wish to try this crap shack to remember to tell the server to tell the cook to HOLD ALL THE DAMN SALT!!!! Just a thought ;-)  PS.  Bartender was hot but not too bright...did understand the \"light\" beer was free with hot dog because it's crap beer and cheap - I'll give her that.",

We were seated immediately by a nice hostess. About 5 mins later our server arrived to get drink orders and appetizers ordered. It took about 10 minutes for us to receive our drinks. It took about another 20 minutes before our apps arrived and then we were finally able to place our order for our entrees. It seemed like the waitress would disappear multiple times. It took forever for our food to come out. A couple of men brought our food out finally. It was good from what I had. There was no issue with the food and that is why I chose 2 stars. The waitress then came by and asked one last time if we needed anything and then she disappeared. We had to ask the hostess if we could get the check. She had to go in the back to get the waitress. We finally got the check and some to go boxes. We waited as she disappeared again into the back. We again asked the hostess if we could pay the check with her. There was a manager standing there who assisted us. He asked about our experience and ww informed him of our experience and that we probably would not be returning any time soon.

TL:DR Waited 15 minutes, Never got serviced, so couldn't eat.   Would I go back? I don't know....really angry about it since my girl was expecting a nice experience and the restaurant made me look bad and worse she was hangry!",

    "text": "This place overall is NOT \"A-OK\" so I'm revoking my 3 stars and giving 2. The only reason I didn't give ONE is that my experience was not completely horrible.  I came for a burger and was hoping to get a deal during happy hour. I got the happy hour burger (All American) for $8 just to see how it was. The burgers you get are served with a little cup of potato chips. Cute. Fries are extra.  Well it was nothing special in appearance or size although it was passably delicious. Get it with bacon added. If I had to pay regular menu price of $11.50 for this simple grade school caff burger I would be SO PISSED. For $8 at Red Robin I get a lot more, nice presentation AND fries.  The normal burgers range $13 to $19 for a double!!  Are you serious?!  It's not even a Wagyu burger! Like I said, fries are EXTRA $. So I scarfed my burger and left. I parked out back, and walked by a VALET BOOTH that was just set up in anticipation of the Escalades, Navigators, and jerkwad sports cars that must flood in with the hordes of uptown office escapees. Well THAT explains everything. Another wallet-milker restaurant that serves mediocre stuff to money-flinging vanilla plastic people who didn't grow up knowing the value of a dollar.  I guess they eat at The Vig restaurants too.  There are LOTS of better burger places. If I showed up for the first time and saw a mandatory valet parking, I would've chewed out the valet and bailed hard! Valet parking for a burger?! Sit on it, Potsie. In fact, I'm not coming back EVER. Better places deserve my money. AND I've read in other reviews that an employee and the valet were being royal jerks! The more I think about this place the ANGRIER I GET!  I hope more people rant about these shenanigans.  This pretentiousness needs a pie in the face.",

They warmed up their marinara sauce and it was soooo good! Dinner was amazing, we are vegetarians so it was really cool we could sub out the regular beef patties with impossible burgers. So this is all the good stuff, the reason why they didn't get 5 stars is because of how much the extra pricing is. Just to sub out their homemade chips with regular fries was $2, and an additional $2 for switching out the burger. We both did that not thinking it would be that much more.  Either way, we loved the place. We would definitely go back again. Just would make sure to make happy hour to get better deals on the food.",

    "text": "We arrived to Cold Beer & Cheeseburgers early on Superbowl Sunday and had our choices for tables, we chose one of the corner tables to accommodate out group of 4 and waited for about two hours for the game to start. Once the game started and they turned on the sound we were extremely upset because we were on an area in the bar where the TV sound was terrible, you could not understand anything and the voices form the broadcast were muffled. By that point the bar was full and there was no way to get another table so we had to suck it up. We did ask the waiter to change the volume of the TV and adjust the speakers but we had no luck.   Walking around the bar we could tell that we were just unfortunate to be sitting on the wrong side of the bar. So, make sure to sit on the center and avoid the corners if you are interested in watching a game and hear it at the same time.   I really liked the beer selection, it is always exciting to try something new and our server was knowledgeable to suggest different beer to try. I wish they had a flight to make the experience even more fun.  The food was okay.. I had the burger on a gluten free bun, and while the burger and fries were good, the gluten free bun was terrible and felt like cardboard. I ended up  just eating a bun-less burger patty.  Room to improve but overall Okay in my opinion",

Just a note, it is fairly loud inside as you can imagine with all of the people and games and such.  I enjoyed it but for some it might be too much.  It was a fun atmosphere.",

    "text": "Awesome vibe and atmosphere for sports. Awesome beer selection. Love that its also a full bar. Food is ok. Tons of bar seating. During tolerable months, there is decent number of outdoor seating. My biggest knock on this place though is that holy hell, you need to improve the audio or sound system in this place. A sports bar that plays sporting events is only doing it half right if all they care about is the visual. During interviews, commentary, post/pre events, you cannot understand a word. At the very least turn on the subtitles if your audio system sucks that bad. Also, if you know for a fact that it's going to be a huge night due to a PAYPERVIEW UFC fight that you obviously support since you paid for it, can you maybe staff appropriately? Two bartenders? Really? Saturday night with a prime payperview fight, the place is packed to capacity, including the outside tables in the middle of Phoenix summer for crying out loud. I would have rated this place 1 star due to the lack of service but I honestly at many points felt bad for the 2 bartenders. Not their fault. The two working were obviously doing their best.   Ultimately, what I truly want to say is that a sports bar doe not simply mean you have a high number of screens. Fix your audio, a lot of sports fans actually want to hear the commotion. I'm not adept at reading lips, and the worse instance to to start learning is when you're drinking beer watching sports.",

Burgers - high quality meat, fresh toppings, lots of flavor. I like customizing burgers, and I like the Monterey chicken sandwich a lot. The chicken sandwich was shockingly *~moist~*, which is always appreciated.   I love the sides here - the tater tots are awesome, the onion rings are huge and very tasty, the fried pickles are banging, and the asparagus is high quality - huge spears.   The side salads are a nice side option, and compliment the heavy burgers.   Wide selection of beers, and great deals on beers of the month.   Servers are always attentive and thoughtful.   Check out this spot on a Monday when it's a flat rate to customize Mac n cheese, or on a Wednesday to customize a burger for a flat rate. I think there's a happy hour, a trivia night, and specials for events/games too.",

First, the \"unique\" hamburgers they offer can be found at most hamburger joints that offer creative burger options.  Second, their pricing is not justified by the quality or portion size. Not to mention that the price of the burger does not include fries or a side.  Third, the service there was abysmal. The waitress took an unnecessary amount of time in getting us menus, taking our order, bringing us our food, getting us our checks. If there was a reason the service was so slow, it was not evident as the restaurant was not busy while we were there.",

Our waitress came back several times to ask if we needed anything and hostess that sat us was happy and smiling.  It was a good visit but nothing really stood out. Food came out quick and hot but for the price point and hype I guess I expected way more.   The place is hip and trendy with the upscale sports bar feel, lots of TV's with any kind of sport imaginable on.  The food although picture perfect was just average. We ordered several appetizers to share, a buffalo totchos and a CB onion dip. One BYO burger. The tots fried perfectly and the buffalo sauce and blue cheese was flavorful but there wasn't enough of either and the thin sliced chicken had no taste and didn't really add anything to the dish. The onion dip and homemade chips were good too but again just average. The BYO burger was ordered with onion, pickles, bacon and lettuce. Patty was thick, maybe a little too thick, cooked well but honestly tasted like any other burger place in town with a little more from my pocket.  We opted to not have alcohol but the beer list is lengthy and they have something for everyone.  We will return, everything was good it just didn't blow us away. It's a casual, centrally located joint with a upbeat vibe.",

First the building itself is pretty amazing. It sits in the heart of the Central Corridor on 7th street between Missouri and Bethanyhome. The exterior wood, the metal and patio are very inviting.  Interior: From the time you walk in and see the big window on the keg cooler directly behind the host stand to the pure awesomeness of all the TV's inside you can't help but be in awe!  Food: I went out of the norm and went with the PBJ burger which our server suggested and it was out of this world. I know it doesn't seem like Bacon, Peanut Butter, Jelly and Chipotle should ever be combined together, let alone on a burger....but it was amazing!  Beer: Over 150 selections between Draughts, Cans or Bottles, enough said. I went with the house CBCB IPA that Four Peaks made for these guys. It was surprising light and refreshing, more in line with a sessions IPA than a traditional hoppy IPA.   Service: Good, very personable and was able to answer all our questions. This is a busy store but wouldn't think it just opened in late March. Seems like these guys have the magic touch and can't wait to see where they open next.  Keep up the great work!",

First impressions, the place is set up well, we were happy to be put on the patio because there was a TV directly in front of us. We started our meal with their buffalo chicken egg rolls, they were surprisingly awesome so we were pretty excited to continue our night there since we would be there for a few hours. Everything was going great until we asked for the patio TV to be changed to the fights, not a soul was on the patio except us, it was oddly slow. They said ok they'll see what they can do.. so 10 min go by, no waitress, no TV change. I saw a busboy and flagged him down and asked about the TV and he said he'll see what he can do... nothing... 10 min later we realized we haven't seen any waitress or anyone and we were sitting there with out menus ready to order our main entrees. So 5+ min go by and here comes our waitress again and we asked about the TV and she said, a manager was supposed to come over. We ordered our food at this time. No manager showed up so I went and found one, he told me the TV could be changed but they couldn't put on the volume because it would change the entire restaurants sound... so eventually our food came out, I ordered the Juicy Lucy cooked to medium. My burger was genuinely cold to the touch... the cheese in the middle was solid... I took a bite in to the burger and it was rare... I'm talking dead rare. I went and found the manager AGAIN... by the way the waitress never came back to our table... he apologized about the under cooked meat, didn't offer to correct it, didn't offer to comp it, didn't offer anything. It was very unprofessional the way the whole night went. I wont be back, my money and time is to be spent in a place where they want my cash. Plus you would think a place with burger in their name they would be able to make a burger. Working in customer service means you service customers... tell the manger and waitress that for me.",

    "text": "My first time to this location(9/19).  I got the Philly Cheese Steak, with jalapenos and peppers, it comes with them.  They forgot the jalapenos and peppers.  I couldn't find a waitress and went to the front, to get a menu, to confirm it came with them.  It does!  When I asked if I could get some jalapenos and peppers, I was told they would have to make another sandwich because everything was mixed in a pot together. Then a manager, not knowing my irritation asked how everything was.  I told him to tell the kids in the kitchen to stir the pot once in awhile.  He gave me another excuse and said it was not pre-mixed.  He gave me $5 off of a $68 bill.  It is a $15 sandwich that I have still never received, they should have made another sandwich.  I could care less about $5.  It did seem like it was a standardized response, probably because they make a lot of mistakes. I will give them one more shot, in case this was an odd day.  I have a strong feeling it is just how they operate.  Returned today to give them a second chance. We got there at 11, place is empty.  The young girl, sat us in the back corner (far SE, worst spot in the house).  I told her we'll take a high top.  Then we sat there for 15 minutes, nobody came to take an order.  Got up and walked across the street to the Culinary Drop Out.  They were great.  We walked by the CB&C manager, he said, \"By\", in a dopey way.  The owner needs to visit this location.  It really is horrible and can't compare to the one on Scottsdale Rd.",

Such a shame because my brother came to visit and we thought we could take him out to have a good burger and we had to spend the rest of our weekend taking turns in the restroom. I don't recommend this place. Spent $80 just to get diarrhea.",

She came back about 10 minutes later and got our food order. As a server myself, I always make sure to check back within 2 or 3 minutes. We ordered mozzarella sticks, I did B.Y.O.B and my friend got a veggie patty with asparagus and tomatoes. My burger tasted really burnt, plain and my chips had zero flavor. My friend's veggie patty had a weird taste and wasn't edible, her asparagus wasn't edible (tasted like fish). Our server never came to ask how we were and if everything tasted okay. We waited almost 20 minutes before asking for our check, food hardly touched, she never asked if something was wrong with our meals since we didn't eat anything. When asking for our check I let her know we weren't pleased and something was wrong with our meals. She took our cash and card, even though we forgot to mention it was half and half she asked after our card was charged if it was supposed to be half and half. She had slight attitude after  returning our check, we won't be back.",

Four of us sat at the bar, where you think the service would be on point - especially when there were only 8 other people at the large bar.  We ordered food and viola 45 minutes later our burgers arrived cold and next to lifeless fries.  The cheese on the burger had that glaze and consistency of a plate that had sat in the service window way too long.  There is nothing that could bring me back to this chain.  Given the mediocre reviews of them all, I'm surprised they are still expanding.  I hear the time clock ticking away as they run out of new people willing to take a chance and finally have to improve or close.",

    "text": "I decided to try this place despite the mediocre reviews. Big mistake. We were seated and given our first round of beers quickly, but that's where the good service stops. We ordered appetizers that were brought out 30 minutes later by a different server. They were fine, but how do you mess up a soft pretzel and tater tots. Our server never once stopped by to see how they were. Once we were done with the apps, we asked a manager to send our server over so we could order entrees. She cane over and took our order, but then we didn't see her again until we paid. After waiting with empty beers and no food for an hour, we went up to the bar to order another round and check on our food. 30 minutes later (an hour and a half total after we had ordered) our food came out. We got the steakhouse truffle burger ($15) which was tiny, undercooked and served on a soggy bun. The chips that came as the side had absolutely no seasoning on them and were too hard to even eat. The hot and smokey mac and cheese ($12) was ok, but basically tasted like microwaved velveeta. The manager stopped by to make a joke about us \"finally getting food!\" But never offered any apology or compensation for our wait. It took another 35 minutes after we were done eating for anyone to come clear our plates. We asked for the check, paid and ran. Being a server myself, it takes a lot for my patience to run out at a restaurant, but this was inexcusable.",

    "text": "I used to go to the cold beer and cheeseburgers up in old town Scottsdale quite a bit. I can say that the Scottsdale location I have never had anything but 5 stars from there. So when the one at 7th street opened up I got excited because it was closer to my house. Not only does it have valet only but the service was so bad that it will make me never go there again. It took forever for us to get in our appetizer order but the waitress didn't seem knowledgeable about the menu. When we got our food they didn't substitute my side (which is a $2 up charge for fries), they over cooked my burger and we didn't even make a manager touch the table. Then we didn't see our server for about a half hour to the point that the water the my wife drank was empty and the water I had that she took because she was thirsty was empty. We had placed both of them at the edge of the table to make sure that the server could see this but she didn't fill them when she finally dropped the check off. Then to put icing on the cake after an hour of waiting so I could pay we finally brought the check to the bartender. Come to find out that she couldn't run it and went searching for the manager. Finally about 20ish minutes later the server came back looking for the check to run the card. Again the manager didn't not come to check on this/us or comp the meal that they messed up completely. I should also state that the restaurant was maybe 30% full while this was all going on so an excuse of them being extremely busy can't even be considered. I will never go back to this place and probably won't go to the one in Scottsdale either because of this.",

    "text": "Ok, this is why some restaurants thrive, and some just do \"so-so\". The hamburger was very good, however, you are forced to get a side of overcooked potato chips, or pay more for any other side. $13+ the side. My husband ordered a side of french fries. I had a few. I felt like they were basically salt sticks, with a little potato. I mean, the level of salt was at an unhealthy level for even a normally healthy individual...and I actually like some salt. I had the chips, which had a sort of bitter after taste because they were simply over cooked. And I ordered a side of coleslaw, which had no flavor and was basically a small bowl of raw cabbage. But at least it wasn't inedible because of salt. Notice to restaurant cooks: THEY PUT SALT ON THE TABLE...BUT WE CAN'T TAKE IT OFF IF YOU INUNDATE THE FOOD WITH IT! Anyway, the manager asked us how our meal was, and we told him about the salt, but he said next time to order it without it...not sure he cared if we come back...because if he did, he would have taken it off the bill. How much can a handful of fries cost...a lot less for him than it did us. And last but not least, the number of televisions in the place made it perfect for people who no longer have anything to say to each other...especially if you have a headache from sitting there with twenty huge screens burning your fricking retinas out. Service was just \"ok\". Burger was good, but not enough to bring me back. And while we're on the subject of nickel and diming people...10 parking spaces available...but huge parking place in the back are valet parking only.....complimentary? Riiiiight.",

    "text": "Well, I think this will be my last visit. What a bad experience! We were sat quickly during happy hour, just a few minutes before it ended. A waitress came over to take our drink order but told us she couldn't take an order for any alcohol (yes, at a place with beer in the name) because she was underage. Our waitress came over and we placed our order. The first girl brought a round of waters, then our waitress brought another tray of water and started to put them down. I told her we were good and didn't need 8 waters for the table, completely oblivious. My husband and I built our own veggie burgers, he added tots and I got a side salad, boy $2 up-charges. Our friends ordered and built their own turkey burgers with up-charged sides as well. It took over 20 minutes for our order to come, my side salad was two days past it's prime and very limp. My husband had ordered jalapenos and Bbq sauce, it was missing both. The veggie burgers immediately fell apart and I found the patty to be disgusting in texture and flavor, despite what we piled on it to disguise it. I eat a lot of veggie burgers and ended up just eating the bun it was so bad. I the party of the half I ate and the other half on my plate, she asked if I wanted a box and I said no, no question about whether we liked our meal. Our friends both had missing add ons and had to wait over 10 minutes to get them. I'm not sure if our waitress (Stephanie) was oblivious or just didn't care but she pretty much sealed the decision not to return to spend $15 on a nasty meal and bad service.",

The drinks were amazing and we ordered the buffalo chicken egg rolls--also great! When the food came, one of the busboys (I assume) took our appetizer plate when we weren't even done. That was kind of strange. We got our burgers and only ate half. Unfortunately, the turkey burgers did not taste good at all. There was no flavor and they did not taste right (they ended up making us both feel sick the remainder of the night). Overall, it seems a bit over priced for the quality of the food. Not sure if we will be rushing back. Kind of disappointed.",

I'd rather it out of a box than what they serve.  What did we have? Here's a list: Buffalo tater tots - friendly note, the chicken tastes like it was boiled or something and then shredded. It was kind of chewy. You know what I mean, that chewy chicken taste? Not good at all  Veggie burger - ok so points because it's homemade but points taken away because it was super tasteless.  Fries, tots: these are extra and don't come with your meal like our serve led us to believe. Sneaky on CBCB part if you ask me. So maybe you fix your ways of doing things? Talking to you management.  Chicken wings: seriously no flavor. None. And they were sooooooo dry.  Burger: the bun was stale, beyond stale, and the burger (I was told) didn't have much flavor to it.  Dip sandwich: they don't serve it with ANY aus jus. NONE?! Seriously?!? We had to ask for a side of it. Positive and the bread was fresh. Negative and the sandwich was tasteless.   See a theme here with their foods?  Note: fries DO NOT come with your burger and the servers DO NOT make that clear so it's an extra charge if you want fries with your sandwiches.  The chicken wings are dry AF. Seriously. No joking around. So sad.   Positives (and there aren't many): the beer selection is pretty decent and they do a rotating monthly beer special that is decent.   So again, I repeat... Come for the beer. Eat somewhere else for the food.",

I haven't been to a cold beer location in many moons and decided to give it a whirl.  My cocktails were great... I particularly enjoyed the CBCB spritz? (which is what I think it is called- a twist on an aperol spritz) that was effen cucumber vodka, aperol, bubbles, and club soda which was awesome!  I had the veggie burger no bun with both chips and slaw.  The slaw was traditional but maybe had some dill in it to make the slaw flavor memorable.   I loved the veggie burger!  We also had Mac and cheese to which I just ate the veggies out of but my husband got so full he didn't even order a main!  Service was good.  Props to the bartenders who made it happen with almost all of the bar-top full!  Thanks!",

We did that ourselves at the bar, our orders were also incorrect upon arrival to the table. I would say $60 dollars for sub par food and pathetic service is well overpriced.

During our meal, our waitress came by our table three times - first to take order, 2nd to drop off our drink order and a third time to deliver the bill. No refills on our drinks, no \"how's your meal?\" or \"anything else?\". A different server walked around with our food and attempted to deliver it to two different tables before figuring out it was our order. We had more interaction with the parking lot valets.",

However, my friend ordered off the kids menu (she asked, they obliged), and she said \"I'd like my drink to be an iced tea\" the waitress brought over a large cup of iced tea. We received our bill and they charged my friend for the large tea. We brought it to the waitresses attention, she was very obviously irritated, and a guy came over to our table, my assumption was he was the manager. He didn't introduce himself, or state is role, but when on to say \"if you order off the kids menu, you get a kids drink, not a regular sized drink\" my friend was nice and said Ok. He then went on to say \"next time you'll have to ask or clarify with your server\"  So, my issue is this, the waitress should have said \"did you want to kids size or regular size\" or she could have said \"that will be an extra charge for the larger size\" I'm of the opinion that it's the server's responsibility to know their job, and it's the manager's responsibility to train them in this area. Therefore, because of lack of training, and poor communication I will not return to this location. There are plenty of other restaurants in the area.",

We ordered our burgers medium and they came out very well done and really didn't have much of a taste. It was very heavy on the bun and the toppings/sauce was pretty limited. Really it just tasted like a lot of bun and cooked meat. The chips had a nice texture and crunch but not much flavor. I was looking forward to a juicy and tasty burger, but as another reviewer pointed out the taste was pretty average and a bit dry. I don't like to say negative things in reviews, especially because I think this is a very neat establishment and a cool concept, but I'm hoping it will be good feedback to the restaurant.",

    "text": "THE WORST SERVICE. We started out with a quick 35 minute wait for a party of six--no big deal for a Friday night in Central Phoenix. But then we got GABBY. And I hope that you don't too. She declined us the opportunity to place our order three times--\"Let me get your water\" then \"let me grab your drinks\" then \"I'll be right back.\" But then she never came back, and 45 minutes after sitting down we hadn't ordered. Then my friend went to the bar to get a beer because he declared that it would be faster than waiting for Gabby. We all protested his actions at first, but then realized that he was right--Gabby never came. When Gabby finally rolled around (long after my friend retrieved a beer from the bar), we told her we were going to venture elsewhere where they would actually take our order (and noted that she served our apps to the table next to us). She proclaimed \"this has never happened before,\" which we could only assume meant that she had never waited a table ever, because otherwise we were sure it must happen often given her performance. And then we left because there are a lot of good places in Central Phoenix with delicious burgers. Why waste your time here? We wandered over to the Parlor and were happily served delicious pasta and pizza. Now we're hoping this terrible cheeseburger place closes and makes space for something deserving of our beloved neighborhood.",

The burger I ordered was supposed to be medium-well, but was SO over cooked and dry. The outside of the burger was charred pretty badly too. I've had a great experience at the Scottsdale location, but this location was a total let down. Very bummed considering I live pretty close and was hoping for another great restaurant on 7th street.  The reason I'm giving 2 stars instead of 1 is because the server was attentive and the draft beer was great. Otherwise, a very underwhelming experience. Hopefully they improve the quality of the food or I'm betting this place will be closed within a year.",

    "text": "Cold beer and Cheeseburgers has the potential to be a great sports bar. They have good craft beer on tap, bottles and cans. They have specials almost every night of the week, and a select craft beer of the month.  We started our meal with a couple of cold beers. Since it was Tuesday, all of the cans were $3, even Ballast Point Sculpin! We ordered a couple appetizers. First up was the Spicy Chicken Wing dip. It was served with house made chips and it was surprisingly spicy! Most places take it easy with their Buffalo Sauce, not here! Flavor was good, but it said it was mixed with Bleu Cheese, but it wasn't discernable. The chips we're good, thick cut, light salt a little tan and not very greasy. We also got the Happy Hour pretzel with cheese. Two big pretzels with a slightly crunchy exterior and a soft crumb inside. It was a  a little too buttery and the cheese was a little overwhelming. The cheese had a kick  as it was blended with jalapenos.  As their name implies they have cheeseburgers, and lots of them. I went with the staple American Burger, comes with American cheese, lettuce, tomato, pickles on a brioche bun. IMHO this is a good American standard that allows the burger to be front and center. As this was my first time, I wanted a good baseline. I ordered it medium and it came out perfect, slight char on the outside light pink on the inside and not too greasy. The flavor was amazing. Definitely a good cheeseburger. I also ordered it with the sweet potato tots. They were definitely sweet! However, they lacked the crunch you expect from tots, hard to do with sweet potatoes. As always we had our picky little food critic with us. He's 8 so he ordered a grilled cheese and fries. It was good, made with three cheeses, American, Swiss and Cheddar. He devoured the fries, we didn't even have a chance to try them, but there just fries.  We were stuffed so we skipped dessert. There is a third thing that CB&CB have, that might appeal to the more masculine crowd, attractive young waitresses in tight yoga pants. Definitely easy on the eyes. Even my wife raised her eyebrows a couple times. What the servers made up for in looks they lacked in actual serving ability. The hostess offered our son a coloring activity and a kids menu, but didn't get us either. Our waitress was not very attentive, didn't say her name when she came to the table, never smiled, and never really checked up on us. We had to get her attention or she would just walk right past. She was more concerned with playing with her hair then anything else. I also didn't see the Manager rounding the tables to check on people. I'm assuming that they had two managers staffed that night, because there were two guys wearing polos standing at the front counter. We were there for an hour and a half and usually they round every hour or so.  I would give this place a second try, but they need to work on the staff. When you go out to eat you expect good customer service.",

    "text": "My husband and I dined recently at the new Cold Beers and Cheeseburgers.  They were very busy, which was understandable, however, after an extremely long wait, I noticed the group next to us, who had come much later, had received their order. It seems they received our order,and needless to say, we chose not to accept it after that was discovered.  We asked to see the manager, who did not offer a drink or dessert for the inconvenience (and extremely long wait), merely said if we had 15 minutes he'd have food to us.  The burgers finally came, at this point we were annoyed,and opted to take the food home.  And the cheeseburgers were not that great for all the aggravation!  Many places in Phoenix to get a burger, we will not be going back.",
