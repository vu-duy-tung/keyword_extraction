    "text": "I live up in north Phoenix but was in the area so I decided to give this place a try.  Besides the greeting I got from the host that seated me, a server didn't come to my table for about 15 minutes- which was odd considering that she was serving both booths that was on either side of mine. A lady came by who I'm assuming was either the manager or the owner and asked if I had been helped yet. I told her I hadn't so she took my drink order. The server then immediately came by and said she didn't come by sooner because she thought I was waiting for someone. Rather than making that assumption, I feel like I should have been asked or at least been given water. My food order was ready to go also so she read it back to me, then informed me they were completely out of avocado. Not her fault at all but how the heck does a sushi establishment not have avocado on a Saturday evening at 5:30 pm... when they had opened their doors 30 minutes prior. Other than that, the sushi was ok.",

    "text": "$2 sake during happy hour + me = pure bliss. We had a really good time here. had Drinks and apps and everything was very good. Spring rolls are bomb! okay due to the fact that sake was only $2  a round lead me to learn the hard way that it is possible to drink to much sake...let's just say the next morning was one of those where recollections of the night before trickle in slowly throughout the day..but all in all i was very pleased with my experience. Did not do dinner but dinner looks very appealing and we will def be back to try. Cool, mellow atmosphere. Pretty big place and good size crowd as well. Service was good as well, they do ask you before they seat you if you will be drinking and they give you a wristband to wear. def recommend trying this place during happy hour!",

Sushi itself wasn't bad but the place seems to cater to a crowd that's more about the Sake Bombers than about the sushi - so good move with the restaurant name. If you would gladly eat convenience store California rolls then this just might be the place for you. That said, dinner was a decent price for what I got. Quantity over quality? Sometimes that's ok with me. I had the Chicken Katsu dinner and some salmon sashimi and it didn't make my wallet explode and leave me living in a cardboard box holding up a sign that says \"will work for sushi.\" Plenty of parking. Place is on the south side of Broadway just west of McClintock. Sushi on Garth! Roll on Wayne!",

    "text": "This is definitely one of my favorite sushi places! The rolls are good quality, and if you go during happy hour, pretty reasonably priced, too. However, they are not stellar, and you can definitely find better quality elsewhere.   Staring with the positives:  -Great happy hour and reverse happy hour specials. Their drinks are pretty good, and the Black Raspberry Lemon Drop is awesome.  -Unique sushi rolls with fun names. Don't expect traditional here--it's definitely Americanized with a college focus. -The atmosphere is wonderful, and the low lighting and interesting seating kind of makes it look like a club  The negatives: -Your server will be hit or miss. There's a couple there I really like, but there are many who can be neglectful.  -It can get pricey. I don't mind pricey sushi, but when they're non-traditional, I don't like paying too much. Going during happy hour really helps! -If you're waiting to be seated, they take you to a waiting area with water, menus, and appetizers. I just don't understand why they can't convert these into more seating space.  It's definitely a college hangout, and it's a great place to go for a few drinks and rolls if you're not too hungry, or heading out late. They're open until the wee hours of the morning! Also, a good tip is they have a pretty cool lunch program with punch card. Definitely check it out.  Overall, great place, and great atmosphere. They do have a lengthy process for checking IDs, but I'm indifferent since it's so close to ASU.",

In light of the fact that there were only 6 people in the place I felt like the wristband proving my ability to drink was uncalled for. (Im 36 and bald) but whatever.   2nd visit, sat down at 945 (weariong a wrist band) my gf had arrived much earlier and ordered me a beer. (they gave last call at 930) She also explained that they were gonna close at 10 so I needed to hurry, at 10:06 I had almost finished my food and we had paid the bill so no one was waiting for us. the server was friendly as could be.  The sushi chefs started changing their shirts and turning the lights off in the area we were sitting. There is a reason most \"chefs\" are hidden in the back, they all have the social graces of a masturbating monkey.   So in a nutshell, it cost me $80 to find out that the idiots behind the sushi bar run the show at this china star super buffet-turned-sushi bar.  to the owners, Spend the $80 wisely because I was one of 3 customers in the entire place and I wont be returning. My guess is you wont be the last business in a retarded long string of failed restaurants in that location, unless of course you get a whole lot better.",

Right up until she dropped off our checks she didn't treat us like a a server should treat a customer. And My friends and I are all servers so it takes a lot for us to not tip 20%...

There are plenty of seats, a great beer & cocktail menu - but the main attraction is the sushi chefs. They know their stuff! Today we had Steven, and he turned us on to some of of his favorites. Every sashimi dish was a little work of art, complete with their signature jalapeno fixins. Who'dve thunk jalapeno would be such a perfect pairing for tuna and bass?  Make sure to ask for their special albacore belly. It's quickly seared, but raw and pink as a jewel inside, and the ponzu sauce is perfect.  The service is great as well. Our server Owen was attentive and helpful, and another gal (with great nail art - didn't catch her name!) never let our water get below halfway before offering us a refill.

They sat us a table after a short wait and we put in our order AS SOON AS POSSIBLE since we were on a time crunch (two special rolls and a salmon skin roll).   After over 30 minutes of waiting, while watching others who were seated after us receive their food, our server apologized for the wait and said it should only take another 5 minutes.   After another 10 minutes, the manager came to apologize and offered us a complimentary bowl of edamame.  After another 7 minutes of watching other people being served THEIR edamame, our two special rolls finally arrived. I asked where our salmon skin roll was and we were told it would be another minute.   When our server finally brought the edamame, I told him \"we don't have time to eat that but if you'd like to take that [edamame] back and comp the salmon skin roll instead, that would be awesome.\" I then witnessed him ask permission from the manager. When our salmon skin roll never came, I asked again how long that would be and I was told that it was actually cancelled.   I thought to myself, what the hell is going on? I explained very courteously that this was unacceptable, and the best the manager could muster was a slew of excuses including \"It's busy\", \"Your rolls were more complicated to make\" (which they really weren't), and my favorite \"You can see we have good reviews; this just happens sometimes. Sorry\".   As a manager, your job is to make sure that the business is profitable and that all of your patrons leave with a smile. I told her that we weren't happy and all she could do was make excuses for why our experience wasn't important enough to salvage.   If she had even put in even an ounce of effort and listened to an unhappy patron, our anniversary dinner might not have been such a disaster. Instead, we were late to our movie, we paid full price for the food we ate, got a bowl of edamame that we didn't order and hadn't the time to finish, and the other roll we did order was cancelled, not comp'd but canceled.   Tisk, tisk, tisk. I'm sorry but this is about as bad as customer service gets. And the last two times I came I wasn't impressed either. But we were craving sushi and I knew this place had decent rolls.   Moral of the story, if you wish to experience of feeling unvalued as a customer, come here during their dinner rush.   Let's just say I'll be exploring alternative sushi restaurants in Tempe from now on.",

I had to coordinate a large dinner group and they very kindly called to confirm the day of, as well as set everything up for me before I got there without me having to wait 1 hour before getting seated (like other places that don't allow reservations on Fridays).",

    "text": "This place is awesome!  My wife and I stopped in on a Friday night before heading off to the Tempe Improv. At first blush, it seemed a little dark. The decor is very black and red...almost like you'd find at some after hours club..only with more windows...or any windows, for that matter. But, it wasn't anything that was going to deter us from coming in.  We were greeted by the hostess who was pleasant enough. She was certain to point out the current specials drawn on the dry-erase board located by the hostess' stand. On this night, the Baja Roll was the flavor of choice. We obviously weren't ready to make such a snap decision before being seated, but we did let the idea simmer while were shown to our table.  Once seated, we took a look over the actual menu. There are several pages offering up varying concoctions, including dinner plates, sushi rolls, and even delicious cocktails available at the full bar. We knew we were about to run into a two-drink minimum in the very near future, so we opted to forego the drinks this time.  After a few times through the menu, and after deeply considering the current special, we had made our decision. For both of us to share, we decided to get two different rolls, as well as an appetizer: The Playgirl Roll and the Baja Roll, plus an order of Mussels.   The Mussels were the first to arrive. Perfect for sharing, and very nicely seasoned. The only downside to the mussels was that we didn't have forks...we had chopsticks. I am absolutely TERRIBLE with chopsticks, so I had to do a little work. Sure, I could have asked for a fork. But what would have been the fun in that, right? Plus, it made my wife laugh, and that's always an added bonus.  After our appetizer, we found ourselves face to face with two beautiful creations. The Baja Roll came on a plate with a surprisingly spicy sauce in the middle of the plate. As the manager explained during one of her many trips to our table, the Baja Roll was kind of like a fish taco, but with a Japanese twist. She was absolutely right. Delicious! Couple that with our salmon, cream cheese and avocado Playgirl Roll, and our dinner was amazing!  I'm honored to be the 100th review for this awesome Sushi spot. It turned out to be a fantastic date night dinner. Hopefully, we'll be back sometime in the near future, if only to improve my chopstick skills. I mean, I'm REALLY bad with chopsticks...comically bad.",

When I get to a sushi place, I am excited about sushi. I always order too much sushi and can't eat it all.   I've been to Sake Bombers twice now and thought I would throw together a review. All in all, it's a bit better than average. I'd probably give it a 3.5 if I could.   It's a far cry from traditional sushi, but that's fine with me. In fact, my favorite thing we got last time was the Chimichanga Roll that had chicken in it and some killer salsa to dip it in. The more standard rolls are good as well and the girl likes it and she's got much better taste in sushi than I do.   Price wise its very reasonable for sushi and if you want a good place to knock back a few for a nice low price, the aptly named Sake Bombers definitely fits the bill.",

That said, it's a fun neighborhood place to go on a Friday or Saturday night, have a few drinks, and enjoy guilty-pleasure sushi.

I found it kinda odd that they check IDs at the door and give you a wristband, but it sort of reminds me of a waterpark, which is exciting I guess.   The happy hour specials are definitely the biggest reason to come here, but we got a little carried away since everything was discounted.

We get it every time even though it's one of the more expensive one's, but be careful with its habenaro sauce(use sparingly. You can also order that sauce as a side anytime). The sauce is bomb! & all the rest is always fresh and good! The sake bombers are a decent price & my friends always have a few while I have an icy cold Kirin.

    "text": "Fuck it - I'm giving this place 5 stars.   It's far too easy to be a sushi snob I guess - which is funny since we're in Arizona - but I meet them all the time. It's also kinda funny to me how sushi-lovers love to hate sushi restaurants. It's like you ask a sushi fanatic where to go and they snidely scoff and mumble something about an exotic little place off the coast of wherever that they've probably only been to once if at all and suggest you might as well pick up a steamy dog shit off the lawn and eat that if you're going to eat at whatever place you were asking about.   I think it's meant to make the rest of us feel stupid for not being an expert. Well I'm a novice - I've only been to about a dozen different sushi places probably less than 50 times. I like the stuff, but I'm not from Japan or anything... I don't have it in my blood. I just know what I like and I tend to get the same or similar things wherever I go.   So given my experiences with sushi places and restaurants in general, I have to say this place is great. The servers were friendly and attentive, the decor was nice and kinda swanky without being overdone, the music sucked but wasn't too loud, and the food was quite good. If that doesn't make a 5 star joint, I don't know what does.  We had a roll and a teriyaki chicken dish from the menu along with a small bottle of sake that we bombed. Everything was crazy good. Oh, and we had edemame as well. The roll was pretty huge compared to most places and the chicken dish was ridiculously huge. For all the food we had, the prices were pretty reasonable.   To be honest, I expected this place to suck. The location, the outside, the name, etc... it all kinda gave the impression this wasn't going to be any good. Well, it was... so I guess... don't judge a book by its cover?   This isn't a chain, it doesn't smell fishy inside (at least it didn't when I was there), and it's clean. Compared to places like zen32 or stingray, this place holds its own. I think it kicks Ra in the ass - and I kinda like Ra okay. I ventured into the bathroom and it was clean and nice, but a little hodge-podgey (2 different styles of sink)... nice though... and clean.   I was actually a little shocked to see so many negative reviews after enjoying it so much... I guess that's the beauty of this site - it's all opinions, so nobody gets to be \"right\" and nobody has to be \"wrong.\" If you're like me and you enjoy your Americanized sushi restaurant grills, you may really enjoy this. If you're a sushi genius, your mileage may vary.",

    "text": "I got a call from a friend the other night that a new sushi bar had opened across from her  local laundromat. Not knowing exactly what to expect from a sushi bar called \"SakeBomber\" I diligently made my way down to Tempe to check this place out, hoping to find another great sushi happy hour (which runs Monday through Friday 5-7 p.m. as I write this review).  I definitely got the nightclub vibe from SakeBomber. It was low lit with colored lights lighting the bar, there were flat screen TV showing sports and hip-hop music playing just slightly too loud (perhaps they're taking a page from the Ra play book).  There was no wait for a table during the Wednesday night happy hour. I ordered edamame, a crispy california roll and a spicy salmon roll. My friend got a spicy tuna roll and a crispy eel roll. While we didn't do any SakeBombs (hey, you wanted a legible coherent review right?) we did enjoy some $1 warm sake.  I'd love to write you something more descriptive here... but all I can really come up with is that \"the sushi was pretty good.\" I enjoyed it, but it didn't knock me off my feet (although the spicy salmon was actually spicy, a nice change from most other places I've tried in the valley). The rolls were slightly larger than what gets served at Sushi 101 (what I would classify as SakeBomber's most direct competition). The only problem I have with this is that it gets difficult to get the entire roll in your mouth in one try.  After reading everything above, you might be thinking to yourself, \"Why the heck did he give this place four stars?\" Price. Although this wasn't the best sushi in the world and I personally didn't care for the atmosphere, as I write this, the happy hour menu is probably the most reasonably priced I've found. Edamame and two rolls during happy hour  was only $11.  I'm definitely going back to SakeBomber... not only do I want to try some things on the non-happy hour menu that looked enticing, continuing to go at happy hour will hopefully keep the sushi monkey on my back from continuing to eat a hole in my pocket.",

We were seated immediately and our server, who had a great butt, came over and asked for our drinks. We ordered some baked tofu and also edamame. Baked tofu was awesome and the miso soup was good too. As for the sushi, a friend ordered the Vegas roll and she said the jalepenos on it were kinda unnecessary. I had an avocado roll and the veggie roll sans cream cheese which were both good.  Sake Bombers gets a -1 star for letting us continue to drink sake...two bottles of sake between three girls. And gets another -1 on the fact that our server, mr. cute butt, did not ask for our phone numbers. Scratch that...it wins one star back for the excellent service and very friendly staff.",

    "text": "Alright, so here's the thing:  I like to drink.  It's something I do well, and I figure that anything you can do well should be done often.  With that being said, I do not take it lightly when a restaurant names itself after an alcoholic beverage (we'll get to Jimmy Buffet's Margaritaville later).  That being said, it was my brother of all people who introduced me to Sake Bombers.  He said to me \"Las Vegas rolls, chicken wings and a sake bomber will do you just right.\"  He wasn't lying.  The problem that people may have with me reviewing a sushi bar is that I don't eat seafood.  I'm allergic to a lot of it.  So you may be thinking \"Why in the shit am I reading this, you twit?\"  Well, because I'm not allergic to alcohol or appetizers, two things that Sake Bombers does well.    The chicken wings they serve have an Asian influence and a spice to them, though I wouldn't call them spicy.  They're a dry rub, not sauced, and they're swear-to-god delicious.  Now, I don't eat sushi, but I'm told by all that accompanied us that the Las Vegas roll, with jalapeno in it, and the White Castle roll, with cream cheese and horseradish, are delicious alternatives to the more standard fare.  As far as the alcohol goes, during happy hour you can get warm sake for $1, a full bomber set for $5, and a Kirin or other Japanese beer for $4.  They have a variety of other cocktails and such, so every type of drinker will be pleased.  The mood is right, tv's and music playing, the crowd is mixed between college-types and after-work specials, and the service is good.  If you don't go to Sake Bombers, I'll fight you.",

After only a couple visits, the manager and staff recognized us and knew our preferences.  2. The prices are reasonable. This isn't some basement bargain sushi but it's not going to empty your wallet either. For those that are on a bit of a budget, they have great happy hour and reverse happy hour deals as well as daily food and drink specials.  3. The food selection is great and so is the taste. This is one of the only sushi places I can bring my non-sushi-eating friends and we are all happy with what we ordered.  In addition, the atmosphere here is great. It's not blaring music like it's a dance club, but it's certainly not dull. The decor is great and they often have sports on half their TVs and other programming on the rest (I believe they had G4 on the last time I was there).  After looking over my review, it's clear I'm not a good writer. Oh well. The point I'm trying to make is that this is a great place and I highly recommend it to everyone.",

I really liked the art behind the bar and the over all feel of the place. It also had kind of a sweet smell? My only complaint was the music that was being played, It was some R & B hip hop type crap. Maybe it wouldn't have been so obnoxious if they had turned it down a little.  2, The Service: Awesome! Our server stopped by our table to refill our drinks the second it looked like we finishing them up. She was also kind enough to point out this guy that was carrying a giant knife on his hip, or as she said \"do you see the guy with the machete on his side\" .  3. The SUSHI : All we had were rolls this time. I saw a couple of rolls that I had never seen before \"Boston California roll\" and a couple of others, but that one.. Holey SHIT! Amazing!

I almost thought there's none. The service was alright, but if you're coming here with a date, I guess it could be romantic since the atmosphere is pretty chill.",

Poor service staff. Sub par quality of fish. Badly constructed rolls and dishes. Terrible sake selection, yet they have the confidence to use the word 'sake' in their name.   This place is so bad you might as well get your sushi from a convenience store.  Apparently they also think they're a club and want you to wear a bracelet to identify yourself as over 21 while you sit at a table for dinner.  Absolute garbage.",

But the con of my meal was the salmon dynamite roll, it came out on a plate and it just wasn't what I was expecting. Instead of standing the roll up in a line, it was laid flat on a plate with a handful of this under seasoned salmon mixture and broiled with panko. It was just not my thing. Wasn't horrible enough to not finish but blah, not worth ordering again.  They do check IDs at the front if you're planning on drinking, if not they waive you through.  Overall I'd come here again, the prices weren't all bad. Service was pretty quick.",

Three stars as this used to be our go to sushi place but after our Valentine's Day experience, am doubting we will return. Called in reservation and what was supposed to be a 20 minute wait turned in to 40 at the door. The hostess claimed to have called my husband's name but butchered it so badly, no one understood her and she marked us off the list. Got seated after inquiring and given a bowl of free edamame for our wait. Ordered 4 rolls and waited another 45 minutes with no food. Looked around and others who came in after, with no reservation, were getting food. Finally got the attention of the sever who shared they were behind but quickly returned with one roll and then a second. After waiting two hours all together, we canceled the last two rolls and asked for the check and a box. The manager did apologize but their customer service is terrible and free edamame was not worth the trouble.",

They have a happy hour menu and a reverse happy hour menu. Ask them about it.   For food:  My boyfriend and i got sea bass, and tuna. One order has 2 pieces for $3.5. We got one of the special rolls, playgirl and volcano rolls. Playgirl was alright. I wasn't a fan of fried sushi, so volcano was eh. overall, the sushi rice was mushie, :/ At the end, we ended up getting yakisoba, and that was eh as well. For the food, i'll give it 2/5 because I had better.  Dranks:  My boyfriend got Sake bombs with your choice of beer for $7? and if you were to get a beer for itself its already $5...mind as well add an extra $2 dollar and get some sake going. What I really like were the Flavored/infusion Sakes. Lychee sake was pretty good. I believe it was $6.5. I think it'll be more worth it if I taste the sake a bit. It felt like it was all lychee syrup :/. For the dranks, i'll give it 3/5.  I think this place good for group events and such but only for happy hour. As for dinner? elsewhere.",

Lets start with the negatives as always:  - You do have to wear a wristband in order to drink alcohol because apparently they were part of sting operation for serving under age groups. You will run into a lot of ASU kids here. - I've seen small children in here on a couple occasions, which you don't typically see at Sushi joints. I don't roll with screaming kids. - The sushi here is good, but not mind blowing.  This place is the most bang you will get for your buck from a sushi perspective. I'm sure everyone has already raved about the happy hour, but in case this is the only review you read: They essentially have an all night happy hour, due to happy hour coinciding with reverse happy hour.  Both of these have great deals, here are the links to those menus:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsakebombersushi.com%2Ffiles%2FHH_3_12_2012.pdf&s=4b3f1073a008b26198a1e5a0b4cb1da9307c272825ebc7f516c5fffd607f116e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sakebombersushi.com/file...</a> <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fsakebombersushi.com%2Ffiles%2Freverse-happy-hour-2-5-2012.jpg&s=08216c49a2e6462e93684758bfd94a512a2ce7d452832a8301dd447d117f85eb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sakebombersushi.com/file...</a>  If you like Wasabi, GET THE FRESH WASABI.  It will make you wonder why anyone would ever eat that play-doe wasabi again.  Another favorite of mine is the lyche sake.  This shit is no joke people. Order it.  They have an excellent variety of drinks, sushi and apps.  I've always had great speedy service. The ambiance is superb.  As always, I'm not good at being positive, so the fact I'm giving out any compliments should blow the doors off your Geo Metro.  YA FEEL ME?!?",

We seated ourselves, per the sign's instructions upon entering, and were greeted almost immediately. The waitress did not hover around while we were going over the menu and deciding what all we were wanting to get.  I wound up settling on the L6 off the lunch menu, which featured two full size rolls from a stated selection with miso soup and a bitter salad on the side. Overall, I wasn't displeased, but the place is not deserving of stellar or amazingly fantastic reviews. The spicy tuna roll was not spicy at all, and the texture was a bit off. The tootsie roll was fine, but I have had better at other sushi bars.   I would go back for the lunch special, but this would not be my go-to place for high-end sashimi.",

I understand that you probably got busted serving someone underage, but please.  The check id three times before being seated is ridiculous.    We also asked the hostess if we can sit in a booth, and she led us to a table.  I understand if there are no booths, I can survive.  Too bad there was a booth open, so we of course asked to sit there.    Our server seemed annoyed that we wanted  to put out separate checks on separate orders, that way it can be easier to split the check at the end.    Another negative, they brought out the \"fried apps\" even before the miso soup or edamame at the table.  How did that happen?  Eventually we get the soup, and have to ask about the edamame.  Turns out they were out and had to make a new batch. They did not even bother to tell us until we aked.  Asked for some eel sauce on the side of the app, told it is a dollar upcharge because it is labor intensive for 3 to 4 hours?  Not one other sushi restaurant has ever charged for eel sauce.    The rolls, were very much subpar.  All three of us ended up rushing home feeling the urge to use the bathroom in a very negative way.  This is the first and last time I will ever go to Saki Bomber.",

Well your real good fried rice with a long history Of filling little bellies, like the one in me Before I put another piece of roll in my mouth You better make sure it doesn't wipe the smile off my face!  Hit me with a sakebomb Why don't you hit me with a sakebomb Hit me with a sakebomb Fire Away!  First opinion when I first walked into Sakebomber was Wow!  I think I like that modern sushi them mixed with traditional Japanese decor.  The place was definitely hip and had a huge sushi bar.  Drink selection was pretty good too!  LCD TV screens help lit the room while the sushi chops away.  I wasn't too fond of the layout of the tables since I thought was pretty close to each other.  I have the tendency to feel someone is listening.....haha!  Moreover, I'm not too knowledgeable about sushi so I let me two counterparts do the ordering.  However, I must say the best dish of the night had to go to the fried rice.  Yes, I'm sure it had a long history Pat.  The rice itself was not made from the traditional rice like most Asian restaurants.  I believe they were actually made with sticky rice rice; if that makes since to you gwhy-los.  I think that's what did it for me, but it was also well seasoned and even though we ordered the vegetarian one - I'm sure the one with meat taste just as awesome.  My second intrique dish was the sakebomber fries.  Breaded with panko I believe and fried.  This was different and it taste like it was fresh cut potatoes.  Kudos for that cause I love fresh cut potato fries and to add that extra crunch!?  Yum!  The rolls we ordered were nothing too special and probably and second thought in my mind.  My two friends that join me that night quoted -- \"It's not bad.  I like the fried rice, but nothing stand out for me\" Kathy H.  While Ms. Tang quoted \"Food was okay.  Good service. Fried Rice was the bomb\". - sakebomb?  Maybe next time - wink!  Service was indeed good.  Our hostess was very pleasant while putting the pink wrist band around my wrist.  She explained they got busted for serving underage kids.  Hey you that's underage -- you know who you are -- if you want to drink stay at home or wait til your 21!  Quit ruining it for the rest of us!  Anyways, our server Yoshi did a phenomenal job and was quite knowledgeable about the menu.  He sold us on the fried rice and it was a winner!    Overall, the food was okay, but the server was tops.  Price wise -- going for HH is a recommendation.  We had a party of 3 and it came out to be about $20 per person.  Next time I drop by think I'll get hit with a sakebomb! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "Great service, quiet place and dim atmosphere. The best value and price combo sushi for what you can get in Arizona thus far that I have discovered.   Not super loud like other sushi places nearby typically are. Reasonable prices; got 5 rolls or so and split between myself, my boyfriend, and a friend.    Came out to only $20 per person and we were super full at the end without even loading up on appetizers or alcohol at all.   For those complaining about sushi being expensive, that's the norm for most places as the quality and special preparation are what you pay for. Also try and get bar seating so you can talk to the super awesome chefs and watch your sushi being made in front of you!",

The Dragon Roll is very very good, and the eel it's topped with is delicious. Sometimes sushi restaurants use cheap eel, which is fatty and gross, but here that is not the case. I also regularly enjoy the Crispy California roll, the Tootsie roll and Shrimp Tempura roll.   I love the atmosphere of the restaurant. I have experienced great service here time and time again, which is key for my return. The wait staff is always super friendly, quite hospitable and give good recommendations.  I love this place.

When I walked in I felt like it smelled a little funny, but that went away once we were in the dining area. If you plan on drinking, they ID you at the front entrance and give you a wristband. Sort of odd, but I guess necessary if you're trying to keep a business open.   It was HH while we were there (5-9pm), so we ordered a couple of apps and rolls. We had the pork gyoza, crab puffs, california roll, killer shrimp, and I think the crispy california roll. Everything was ok - nothing extraordinary. The service was good, but considering the HH were pretty high, I'm not sure I'll return.",

The carding and the wristband at the front wasn't that big a deal--it didn't take up too much time, so I was okay with that. The place was maybe about half full, certainly not as crowded as I was expecting for a Friday night, but the service was still suuuper slow. The appetizer, pork gyoza, came out pretty fast, but there was a huge gap between our appetizer and sushi. We were starting to think maybe they were waiting for us to order cocktails before they finally brought out our first plate of sushi, California rolls. There was another big wait between the California rolls and the tootsie rolls.  The pork gyoza was okay but expensive, almost a dollar per gyoza. The sushi was nothing phenomenal, but what can you expect in Arizona?  The most annoying thing, though, was that we paid cash, and we were supposed to get $19 and some small change back, but our waitress gave us $14 and small change. They stole even more than what we would have tipped, considering the terrible service. Literally never going back here.",

Ordered the 8 piece salmon sashimi for $10 and the portions were ridiculously small and thin. Didn't eat one piece of it due to skin still being on the underside. Since the salmon sashimi didn't fill me up, I ordered a Philly roll as well. It had very little rice and I could barely taste the smoked salmon due to the heavy amount of avocado and cucumber. As we were leaving, the waitress followed us outside since my partner forgot to sign the second check; however upon seeing that she didn't recive a tip(I had tipped on mine), she scoffed to my partners face. Although the service was good up until that point it, seemed she was more concerned about getting a better tip than making sure we signed so they could run the transaction. We came in with high hopes due to the other reviews and were beyond disappointed. I will say the only complete positive was how nice the woman with short hair and a name tag was, that's all. I suggest going somewhere else if you're looking for a better experience. UPDATE: After about 15 minutes after leaving my partner and I are now feeling very queasy and nauseous, if either of us begin to vomit or cramp, I will be calling the store to let them know there is something wrong with their food/fish.",

Favors, textures, presentation and yes, pricing. We hit happy hour. Choices were vast and each plate was so tasty. We hit all the categories and each plate was beautiful in presentation and marvelous on the palate.  Each sauce a perfect match to the plate of food.  Beer selection was impressive and the bar appeared nicely stocked. The mules looked especially inviting but I was enjoying the fresh local beers too much to switch. Someone had to drive! Mules will be my next adventure.  Expected this restaurant to be good.  Didn't expect it to be wow!  It was wow! Our waiter Owen  was superior in service and attention to this novice as he navigated the menu.  We will be back...to try soups, noodles and the long list of rolls and bites we didn't try today.

After placing an order on the phone, I was quoted 25-35 minutes for my order, which included 4 rolls and 1 garlic edamame. I arrived 40 minutes later and was quoted another 10 minutes until my food was ready. I was given my edamame right away but it was cold. No apologies for the late food or cold appetizer.   A manager then quoted us another 5 minutes, which then became 10. Again, a small apology was made but no efforts to rectify the situation.   I asked for a new order of edamame because ours was cold, after asking several times, the manager (Rebecca) agreed.   In the meantime our food was no where to be found. We eventually got our food an hour and 15 minutes AFTER I placed my order over the phone.   I requested that part of the bill be taken care of and after negotiating back and forth (and the manager claiming she had no power) she finally agreed. She took off the 2 appetizers, eel sauce, and the fresh wasabi. Nothing in comparison to the rude service and late food.   On top of all this the hostess was rude, said the F word to a customer on the phone, and never apologized for the wait. They did offer us free water several times, so I'll give them that.   Mediocre sushi for way to high a price. Not worth the time.  Side note: it was a Sunday evening around 8:45pm and the restaurant was hardly busy.",

Their sashimi is consistently of good quality, and their rolls are both creative and tasty, with a generous selection to choose from.  Finally, they have a wide selection of Asian beers and Sakes to choose from plus of course a full bar.     The atmosphere is typically lively and service has always been good.     If you're into sushi, you like to enjoy a few sake bombs with your Asahi, Kirin, Orion, etc, and you enjoy a nice lively atmosphere, SakeBomber is a great option!",

It was a pretty cool place when I first walked and the girl at the front desk was really gorgeous looking, Which then gave me a good start of the night. I enjoyed the sushi there which were you're typical sushi like any other place. I also orders a garlic shrimp on a skewer which too was pretty tasty. The only bad experience I would have to be that our waitress was a little forgetful and slow which was a bit annoying but after a few sake shots, it didn't bother me much anymore. The lighting at the place was a a bit gloomy as well. I understand it is trying to make you feel that dim and romantic like feeling but for me it was making me sleepy along with the rest of my party. I would add this to my list of ok sushi places.",

The sushi was well rolled, the wait staff was friendly, the chefs interact with you and if they don't, it's probably cause they're concentrating on making sushi haha.  I like how people show up at restaurants at 945 when they close at 10 and then B about it... get a life, cause obviously the chefs and their families have one.  And why are you watching monkeys masturbate anyways... sick nasty, get a life.  Eat at Sake Bombers more and maybe the chefs will invite you to chill after work.",

Enter restaurant, the hostess accosts us and belts, \"Who's drinking?\"  I look at my fifteen year old son and say, \"Well, I am.\"  She then pinions us to the entrance way with a seemingly mandatory recitation of the specials and some other stuff and when I am just about to ask her to, please, just show us to our table, she finishes.  The decor is mostly black, and the kind of bar lighting that makes you wonder what might be crawling on the floor - kind of revamped, trendy, fraternity house grunge.  The center of the table we sat at had a thick, sticky, old, oily surface on that I didn't think they could get up without solvents so I just put a napkin on top so my arms wouldn't stick to it.  They brought a glass container with a candle in it that was covered in oily smudges and bits of food.  I mean really - it was disgusting.  Ordered tempura appetizer that was seeping with oil - the antithesis of good tempura.  California roll, ok.  Son had beef and veggies with soba noodles, except they forgot the veggies.  We eat nori rolls frequently and have been making our own for years, so we are not new to the concept.  The juicy roll I ordered was not as decribed by the server, who was, nevertheless, very attentive and pleasant and did refund us for the roll.   Also had some kind of \"western\" roll with chicken and an inedible hot sauce, without which, the roll had no flavor at all.  The Creme Brulee was good.  I hated this place.  For more than $80 we could have had a really nice dinner somewhere.",

I tried the stuffed shrimp appetizer and it was dry and zero flavor. My friend had the calamari and it was soggy and chewy. Not only were the appetizers horrible the sushi was appealing. The playboy roll was dry and the spicy tuna on top tasted off. The Tasty Tuna roll was iffy. I probably should have just sent it all back but we were starving. Well we all learned our lesson later that night. I spent a half hour throwing up because the sushi/food made me sick and i know my friends also spent their nights in close proximity to a bathroom. Honestly, I would not eat here unless you are looking to get sick.",

Now if you want to drink at Sake Bomber's, you had better be ready to get carded at the door and wear a wristband for the night.  Its totally not a big deal (if you're over 21), and probably a smart move on their part business-wise so they don't get busted.  The sushi at Sake Bomber's is decent--its not over-the-top amazing, and certainly not bad.  This place does go a little over the top on selections though.  There are so many rolls, appetizers, specials, dinners, to choose from--its a little intense, and perhaps overwhelming for the indecisive order-er.  The prices are average for sushi.  The ambiance is a cross between a lounge and a sports bar.  Sake Bomber probably isn't your best bet for sushi in Tempe, and certainly not in all of the Phoenix Metro Area, but its a good place to go when you want to mix it up in Tempe (maybe you've been going to Sushi 101 every night) or for big groups.",

Have had every server (been there that much) and they are all friendly, know the menu, and recommend the best specials! The sushi is amazing, don't be afraid to ask what's good that day because the chefs know what's up!! Atmosphere is never a let down. You find yourself conversing with the boss in no time, which makes you feel really welcome :)",

I thought I was set. There was even a Native New Yorker for all the Natives to conveine at. I thought I was SET!  I ventured across the street to sakebomber. It doesn't look like much from the outside but when you get inside, it's dark and modern and what some aging hipster thought was cool. The menu is varied and the sushi selection is the usual suspects. It's average sushi. Nothing to write yelp about. But I did like the Chicken Katsu. I haven't been here in a bit, but it's okay.   For the sushi novices, I think this is a perfect place to get used to the flavors of sushi. But for the sushi master, this place will not do... maybe in a pinch but with an even better sushi joint one block south, it's not worth it. I say go with friends who want to try out sushi.",

I dont consider this to be happy hour prices, I could of gone to Kona and it would of been a nicer atmosphere, and better food for about the same price if not less. The stuffed shrmp and the gyoza was good, nothing that is a must have and the rolls were not rolled thight enough. We saw that they had a special for $20 pitcher of sangria. Thank goodness we asked for a sample becasue it didnt look anything like the picture(picture shows red and we got yellow sangria) and it didnt taste good at all. Overall I wouldnt go back, unless as group of friends wanted to go to happy hour and were set on this place.",

It's got the perfect blend of fresh fish with a spicy kick, without overwhelming the flavor of the fish. One of the more unique rolls on the menu.   Eric and Steve, the head sushi chefs, always make great sushi, and are willing to go off the menu if you ask them to (provided it's not too busy).   The bar is average at best. Stick to sakebombers, straight shots, or just beer. The mixed drinks are over-priced and under-poured. They look nice, but they don't get the job done.   Overall, SB's is a great place to get good sushi at reasonable prices.",

    "text": "The Rolls are fantastic! My girlfriend (who loves Sushi even more than I do) says that SakeBomber has the best in the valley, and she may be right. Since she's the expert, we went with some of her favorite signature rolls, and a cucumber salad. All the picks were top notch. If you like your food with a spicy kick, go for the Playboy roll. It was awesome. The prices are very reasonable and it also wasn't too crowded.  We arrived just before 7:00 on a Friday night and were immediately seated.  While the food is fantastic, the place itself is full of negatives.  The good news is none of them are big enough to stop me from coming back, but here are some of them:   The first question by the hostess after asking how many are in our party was 'will you be drinking tonight?' Turns out she cards you, then gives you a wristband. While I can understand that later at night (during reverse happy hour), I'm not a fan of having to eat my dinner at 7pm wearing a cheap piece of paper on my arm.  SakeBomber's decor looks more like it's trying to be a Sushi bar.  Not quite the upscale look most go for, but they went for the poor man's try.  That may actually be a plus now that i think about it.  You can dress down at this Sushi bar and not feel out of place.  They also don't take American Express (my card of choice). Who doesn't take AmEx in this day and age?",

I'm not a fan of their tea, but that's just a personal preference, I think. I enjoy the Las Vegas, but the Spank Me roll was really good as well. We usually mix and match our way around, and right now they're running a \"happy day\" 4pm-9pm special on a lot of their rolls which makes them cheaper by $1-$3, each. Definitely worth it.  Good service, laid back vibe, even if the decor is a little \"college dorm\" with the lighting, but overall, fun, good food, and affordable.",

These rolls are not like the skimpy ones you'll find at Ra and they're cheaper, especially during happy hour.  I will say that a lot of the rolls are spicy, and I love spicy, so that could be why I am obsessed with Sakebomber!  The staff is the best, too!!

We were really excited it was happy hour when we went but only to find out it was more expensive that any happy hour I've ever been too. The sushi tasted like the rice was cooked in sewer water or something other than water. I ordered another roll just to give it other chance thinking it was a bad batch of rice and it was still unsettling. Also they didn't have any of the beer we asked for and finally got a beer close to what we wanted and then over heard the waiter tell the table next to us they were out of the beer we were drinking after 20 minutes. I'm not sure how you run out of 4 different beers that quickly on a slow Tuesday night. Overall had no idea what was in that rice and I don't think I'm going back to find out. Such a bummer!",

The only reason why I knocked off a star is because the serving size is smaller than what you pay for.  I don't believe in eating, but still being hungry afterwards.

    "text": "This place is really more like a 4.5 in my opinion. I just went there tonight for reverse happy hour/ dinner with the BF after both of us having school for around 12 hours today (ugh). We needed a drink. Well, we decided on Sakebomber because it is close to our house and because the place we were originally going to try (Saketini) didn't have reverse happy hour until ten. Anyway, I'm glad we gave this place a shot. It looked a little sketchy from the outside, but the inside was nice and comfortable. We got ID'd at the door and given bracelets, which was a bit weird, but fine with me. Also, the hostess was a really sweet girl, so it made it less weird. We were sat, and our awesome waitress, Joy, came by to get drink orders fairly quickly. The BF got a beer (asaki... I think) and I got the Bahama Mama on Joy's recommendation. They cost 4 and 5$ respectively. My drink was wonderful! It was all banana-y and coconutish and just delicious.   So we ordered cucumber rolls, gyoza, spring salad, and the chimichanga rolls. The BF liked the cucumber rolls (I didn't try them), The gyoza were clearly generic gyoza, but at least this place had good sauce and they were crispy, which was pleasant. The salad was alright, a bit too peppery, but good and fresh tasting.   So chimichanga rolls you may ask. They are rolls that have fried chicken (True story), avocado, jalapeno, rice, cream cheese, wrapped in seaweed and then the whole thing is fried and served with habanero sauce. This sounds like a food eaten on dare or thought up by a very drunk person. Good for them, though, because these were wonderful!!!! I have never enjoyed a sushi roll, mainly because I do not usually like the flavor of seaweed, but it was a lot more subtle in this roll (probably due to the deep fry) and I really liked them. The sauce was super yummy!   So we eat all of our food.....all of it..... and are still nursing our drinks, when Joy comes over and says 'oh, you're still drinking, would you like me bring you some free toasted marshmallows... I thought I heard wrong, but I did hear free, so I said.... ok..... She brought out these delicious toasted marshmallows on whipped cream with strawberry sauce. It was great!... albeit very weird.   The whole meal (two alcoholic drinks, gyoza, two sushi rolls, a salad, and a dessert) cost 30$. Overall, this place was great and I will most definitely be back with as many people as I can introduce to this great place!  Update: Went back tonight for a 'snack' and for the BF's dinner. Got the chimichanga roll..... Even better than last time, if that's possible! The more habanero sauce... the better! We also split the tempura ice cream.... Also super delicious. It's ice cream wrapped in cake and then fried with chocolate sauce and whipped cream on top.... yes it is as delicious as it sounds.  Oh... we had Joy again, and she rocks my socks! Probably the coolest waitress I've ever met, so major props on that!",

    "text": "Sake Bomber is an amazingly beautiful restaurant that is perfectly situated just off ASU campus. They do an age check upon entrance for anyone that wants to drink specifically because they are close to ASU which is understandable if not slightly cheesy for an upscale place. I presume they dont do it at the table in order to speed up service. However as this is a SUSHI (Fish) restaurant I will not spend time analyzing their liquor which was perfectly fine but not super awesome.  Sake Bomber gets a lot of traffic for 2 reasons. 1) they have a very good reputation and 2) they are around alot of ASU students but not on campus. This may mean they go through a sizable amount of fish per day and sometimes it is not always the best/freshest fish. This is what happened to us last night.  I want to say upfront that AAron our server was exceptional. The food came out fast and that was a great plus to this place which is why it has 3 stars.  I ordered salmon roll..it's not on the menu but it is a simple roll I like to order to see the quality of fish before I order a more elaborate roll. I also ordered 2 salmon nigiri presumably made from the same batch of salmon. In both cases the salmon was not a quality cut nor a quality taste. It wasnt spoiled, rotten or off color but it also was not cold/crisp and delicious. The nigiri was slimy and shredded, not a solid piece of salmon.   Now you may think I am over analyzing this and you would be correct. This was going inside my body and also taste is important when it comes to sushi. I would drive extra for great sushi than just get inexpensive stuff around the corner. This was neither inexpensive nor great. It was good but it wasnt awesome.  5 people = $125.00 . Yes my friends did get sake and it was not all happy hour ordering..but it was expensive compared to other places. I presume we are paying for the decor and ambiance more than the actual fish. Perhaps they should rename the place \"SakeBomber - We have Fish Too\" and then the expectation level wont be so high.  ps the 4 TV's in the dining room were a distraction. I think TV's should be kept at the bar not places throughout the eating area.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I have been reading almost every review on here about this place, and have been chomping at the bit to try it.   Arrived there with my wife, and two daughters. We did not get Joy as a server, I made sure to check their names. I think she was off in the middle of the day, maybe working nights only.   Anyway, we sat down and the two girls that sat us/served us were very nice and friendly. I give three stars just for them being cool. I looked over the sushi menu, and all but three (I think) rolls were listed as spicy. I do not eat anything spicy. I am weird, yes I know, but I want to taste every flavor in my food rather than burn my mouth so I can guess if it is good or not. I ordered the Las Vegas roll, and requested regular salmon instead of baked salmon along with nothing spicy at all please. Also ordered the baked scallop roll. We got our older daughter the lunch special of Teriyaki beef, and our newborn we got some hot water to make her a bottle :P (she's one month old). The beef came out first, and all three of us tried a piece. It did not taste that great, and not much flavor to it at all. I ate the miso soup instead. Next came the Las Vegas roll, in which the plate had six super slim pieces of sushi with jalapenos on them.  I was pretty upset, but figured I would pull them off and hope my mouth didn't get burned from jalapeno juice left on the rice. I didn't taste anything spicy, but wow my mouth had this horrible taste of baked salmon. I believe it was fresh, so please don't think it was bad but I just can't stand that weird taste of baked salmon. I gave the rest of the roll to my wife, and told her I would help eat what she couldn't of the next roll. Out comes the baked scallop roll, and this thing is huge. I mean it covered the entire plate. I was very impressed, and thought they totally redeemed themselves. I took a piece, and it tasted like pieces of no flavor fish on a California roll. I do mean absolutely no flavor. I asked my wife to try it so I could know if it was my taste buds or not, and she had the same result. I told her I didn't want to eat any more of it, and was very disappointed about the food. So my wife, being the good girl she is, ate that roll also so it wouldn't go to waste. I couldn't believe it, we paid almost $25.00 for something that Teharu sushi sells for $3.00, and they have a ton of flavor when it's fresh.   If you have eaten here, and think my story is bogus, then don't worry because I am very picky when it comes to sushi. I am still looking for good sushi like I have had in northern California.   So as if the food was not bad enough, the cooks did the same thing as another yelper mentioned. They started changing, and turned off the lights around where we were. The servers were still nice and friendly, but wow it felt like a \"hint hint. . . . . Get out now!!\" from the cooks.  So breakdown: 3 stars = Service from the girls 1 star   = Food -2 stars = the cooks not getting the order right, and being pushy for us to leave.",

It was easy to tell that our Sushi was made with love and pride The Signature drinks were an unusual blend of Boba, Sake, Bailey's and such, but it all worked and blended together nicely.  Try the Ladybug! It's the drink our Server suggested and it was spot on.  This place opened at 5pm today and was jumping by 545.  The eclectic mix of people, the music, and the sports TV was like having great sushi at a great bar/club.",

    "text": "After having stopped by this place's parking lot plenty of times, it was time to see what was actually inside.  The exterior definitely belied the expansive interior of this place. There was ample room in the entrance, plenty of dining tables, and even an area to lounge about for larger parties.  The atmosphere was definitely inviting. Our waitress was kind, cordial and prompt. It was surprisingly busy, late on a Sunday afternoon. They had a fair amount of patrons just enjoying their meals.  Speaking of meals, we ordered the Bento Combo, along with some soup.  The Bento Combos were quite delectable. The chicken and the beef were quite flavorful, and properly season. But, we did have some quibbles about some of the side items we ordered.  The soups were bland and lackluster. I am not sure how long they had been sitting in a pot, but their main ingredients seemed to have departed for the bottom a while back ago. It would have been nice to have seen a bit more sea weed and tofu, plus the seasoning just wasn't flavorful enough.  The Gyoza was overdone, and quite hard. The meat was okay inside, but the tough exterior didn't make it enjoyable. The small side salad seemed a bit wilted, and there was far too much dressing on top. However, the accompanying rice was quite delightful.  All in all, the experience wasn't bad, we likely will be back again if only for the nice service and the atmosphere.",

I've been here multiple times with my boyfriend and I have to say that they've never disappointed. A few times when they've been really busy the service might be a little slow, but they at least continue to check up on you and give you updates on your food and such, which to me is very important. Things happen, but at least address the issue, don't pretend like it's not there. Highly recommend this place. The varieties of rolls are amazing. I highly recommend the \"White Castle\" or \"Crab People\" and always make sure to check out what their special roll of the day is as it usually is also quite amazing!!!",

But other than that we had a lil spread of eel and salmon nigiri, something called an orange blossom roll and a rainbow roll. We couldn't even finish. And our waiter was adorable and super sweet. It wasn't that packed on a Thursday night so it was a perfect date spot.   Date Rating: 5 out of 5. This Rating could be sake induced but idc. Eli looks nerdy cute with his wayfarer style glasses and studious haircut but he's devious. He talked about being the baby of the family and getting away with murder while I whined about being the oldest and basically a martyr for my younger siblings. He likes to rock climb and promised to teach me how to snowboard if I wanted. We planned our next date and he told me I'd love his lazy little puppy. I typically hate PDA so you can imagine my embarrassment when the hostess had to tell us that they were closing in order to get us to quit making out in our booth lmfao",

They are a strong crew and treat you right. Happy hour is lit on prices and seriously all the delicous sushi looks creative and fun, too. Nice to go to a sushi spot that isn't pretentious!  P.S. Only down side (and I won't dock the review for it but you should know) is that the staff is so light-handed that we have to wait for a seat even so 1/2 the restaurant is open (can't even order a beer while waiting). Would love an update here as I understand needing to wait for the server/bartender (been in the industry most of my adult life), but also the manager or host should let you order something while you wait. Also, if you sell shirts you should have them in stock! We've been trying to buy a pair all year long.",

Walking into SakeBomber their are signs with few features for night which immediately capture your attention. The restaurant was busy with normal Saturday fair amount of people but we were sat right away at booth.   Service: Our sever came right over with waters to introduce herself and ask if we wanted anything else to drink. We put in our orders with sushi  rolls to start. My friend recommended Salmon Dynamite roll. It's a California roll with cooked salmon/ crab mix on top.. I think the three of us ate that roll so fast!   Sushi rolls: We ordered a total of 4 rolls, Salmon Dynamite, Shrimp Tempura, Sunshine and Caterpillar rolls. All very good rolls.   Drinks: I got the Thai tea.. I would recommend maybe sticking with soft drink or sake. My friends got hot sake and green tea but reported very good.   I would come back to try additional rolls",

I tried to just go with it and the restaurant was hot, the food was warm; it's not a good sign.  Usually sushi restaurants are very, very cold because they're keeping the raw fish cold.

I'm very glad I did! I love their wide variety of rolls (love, love love the specialty rolls! - the White Castle, Angry Shrimp, playgirl just to name a few) not to mention a full menu from the kitchen if you aren't a fan of raw fish;) they have a decent happy hour and reverse happy hour as well.",

    "text": "Wow....my friends and I went here last night after checking out the Yelp reviews. We normally go to Sushi Brokers or Kabuki, but their regular happy hours had ended for the night. We decided to give Sake Bombers a try since it's right down the street and their happy hour goes until 7 pm. We were extremely disappointed. The only roll we ended up finishing was the Boston roll, which was pretty good. The Crispy California and Tootsie were okay, but nothing great. The eel sauce was a little thick. The Salmon Dynamite roll is also just okay, but the spicy mayo here is HORRIBLE! My friend got a side of it and it seriously looked like someone just squeezed some Miracle Whip out of a tube and added some other flavors/colors to it. It was thick and chunky, and quite frankly disgusting. Do not order the Playgirl -- the fish on top was not fresh, and the ginger soy sauce was overwhelming. We barely touched this roll.   The happy hour was also not very great -- they didn't even have something simple like a spicy tuna on happy hour. Who wants to pay $7.50 for a basic roll that's normally on happy hour for around $4 at other places? I had a stomach ache for about two hours after eating here...I'm thankful I didn't get sick, but this was honestly the worst sushi experience I've ever had.   It's also kind of ironic that the food at this place was so poor, when the sushi chefs and most of the workers were actually Asian. We will not be returning here ever again.",

    "text": "Sake Bomber has very good sushi and excellent sashimi.  Maybe one time in five the sushi doesn't quite hit the mark for whatever reason, but even then it is good.  The sashimi is invariably spot-on.  The lead BT (Owen) is excellent and knowledgable on the food as well.  Definitely does me justice on my beloved Absolut Kamikaze's.  You have absolutely got to try their fresh wasabi, it is the best ever and destroys the paste.  Prices are low to average, every once in a while I find myself a little bit surprised at the tab, but it is certainly within reason.  Actually, the suprises are generally due to loading up on the booze, so I'm to blame for that aspect.  They have some fairly decent happy hour specials, and that helps to cut the bill.  I will say the exterior is basic, but the interior is fairly nice and authentic enough.  It can get a tad noisy, especially on Friday nights since this is just under 2 miles from ASU.  I don't mind this in that our kids go to ASU and to me the younger crowd's vitality is appealing.  Granted, if you are looking for a quiet dining experience you might want to avoid the weekend nights.  Weekday nights are usually fairly quiet.  In total, Sake Bomber is my absolute favorite for sushi and sashimi in the Phoenix area, and most certainly it's the best in Tempe.  About the only downside is that it's a bit noisy on the weekends, but that is not enough to slide the \"5\" rating down to a \"4\".  I guess I would add that maybe one time in five the service is slow since it can get packed quite quickly.  However, the foodservers and BTs are pleasant and knowledgable about their offerings.   Whatever you do, you've just got to try their fresh wasabi.  It's boatloads better than the paste.   Pretty sure it's a $1, but that will be the best dollar you will spend for the year.  If you're the drinking type, ask for an Absolut kamikaze, goes great with the sashimi.",

    "text": "S has been on Yelp searching cool places for me to try during my visit here to the Phoenix area.  Being away from home and wanting some comfort food, S suggested that I try Sake Bomber to get my sushi fix. The location was in close proximity to my hotel so I made arrangements for transportation to the restaurant. The staff at the front desk mentioned that the food there was pretty good.  So, let's put that into perspective...  I'm sure that there are many fine restaurants in the Phoenix area. When I'm visiting I love to experience restaurants (not chain) to get a taste of the local flavor. I'll have to say that SakeBomber is not the best representative of what Japanese food should be...  I arrived during happy hour and the wait staff was very friendly and accommodating. I had imagined that I might be able to catch up on some reading while dining - but this was not the case. A patron of the restaurant, who thought he was being funny, was loud and demanding more drinks from the server. The dark interior, dim lighting and thumping music wasn't conducive to a serene dining experience.   Oh well, I was here to get my sushi fix. I'm thinking that I shouldn't judge on appearances and maybe, just maybe, the sushi would redeem the thoughts that were going through my head.  First came the gyoza and agedashi tofu. The gyoza was ok, but was very disappointed with the agedashi. I'm used to the agedashi dishes from Gombei or Hoshi's - piping hot chunks of creamy deep friend tofu, swimming in that wonderful sauce, covered with bonito flakes, grated ginger and radish. Instead I got chunks of barely warm firm tofu arranged on a platter with tempura sauce and sprinkled with a few green onions. I was hungry so, I ate it.   I must admit that the salmon skin roll was the best deal of it all - 8 pieces of salmon skin nigiri with grilled asparagus and carrots. It was filling as well as yummy. I also had smoke salmon and hamachi maki. The fish was not the best I ever had, but I think that the sake I had during dinner helped the experience along with watching the snow boarding competition on the big screen TV behind the bar.   I called the hotel shuttle to pick me up after dinner. I had to chuckle when the driver asked, \"How in the world did you end up at SakeBombers?\"  \"You see,\" I told him. \"It was like this...\"",

From the street, this place doesn't look like much, but inside, it has a pretty cool, low lit ambience. You are carded from the moment you get to the hostess stand. It's Tempe! Don't take it personal. IF you are of the sipping age, you get a bracelet from that point so that you can partake in what else? Sake Bombing! We had several apps upon ordering. Crab puffs, ( I can't have them due to a food allergy), but they smelled awesome and were gone within 8 minutes. The cucumber salad is always a fav of mine when I am at a sushi place, and this one came with a couple of crab sticks atop. So good. For our sushi rolls, we ordered the special, Miso Sexy roll; the Firecracker Roll; The White Castle roll, (I know you expect the thing to be topped with midwestern burgers!), which was hands down, everyones favorite.. (and no... no burgers!); The usual Vegas roll; we had nigiri in salmon and tuna. Complete with sake bombers and the special of $3 raspberry vodka that you can do anyway; we did seltzer. All that for 4 people, under a $100. We walked away very full and decided that this is now our new favorite sushi place. Sometimes you just never know how surprised you may be by what isn't 'pretty' on the outside, yet amazing on the inside!",

This location probably gets a lot of college kids coming in, and this way the waiters can easily see who can order another round in big groups without having to remember who they carded or not.

The service was okay, not anything to brag about, but not anything to complain about.  Neither add nor lose a star.  Now the most important detail about any place to me is the drinks.

My server Kelsey was awesome, she told me about a \"secret\" menu item, I don't know if it actually is but I told her what I like and she recommended the sesame sea bass and it was amazing. I'm pretty sure the chef(s) we're Mark and Steve? I was so happy with my food and how it was prepared. The sashimi was out with daikon radish which is meant for garnish but it was so good. I asked Kelsey about it and the chefs were kind enough to give me a giant pile of it.   Everyone was so attentive and helpful, I have been there since and I don't think Kelsey works there any more, unfortunate for the company because her service would keep me coming back - however I have seen the same chefs and the food has remained wonderful. Good prices, good food and I personally had great service.   Good sashimi and you've got me. I've been elsewhere since but Sake Bombers is great for the prices you get - if Kelsey comes back, call me, but in the meantime hang onto Mark and Steve as long as you can.",

    "text": "Good food- BAD service.   Food: AGADASHI TOFU!!! SO good! sushi is good, love their salmon skin rolls- chicken teriyaki is really really good.  The reason I give only 2 stars is because the service is TERRIBLE.    Went there with a party of four, place was empty.  They didn't clear our appetizer plates off our tiny table when bringing the rolls out so the plates were hanging off the tables.   We had to ask 2 different people 3 times for the green (sodium free) soy sauce after they brought the sushi (took about 15 minutes to get the soy sauce so we had to sit there staring at it for 15 minutes instead of eating it While one person in our party waited for soy sauce).  When we needed refills, waitress was nowhere to be found.    Also, they  Gave us the check before we asked for it which is strange for a sushi restaurant and we definitely would've ordered more if our waitress hadn't decided for us that our meal was over.   Three different people came to our table AFTER we payed the check (where were they during the meal??). as if they wanted us to leave even though the place was empty and it was nowhere near closing time.  Really Weird vibe from staff at the end of the meal.  The other two times I ate there the service was Okay.  I probably wouldn't dine in again, but I might consider ordering the  tofu for pick up!",

The garlic shrimp appetizer was amaze balls actually. I mean, really really good! The sushi however was below mediocre. Not much flavor and tasted like something I could purchase at a grocery store.

My lady and I each had beers: she had Kirin light, I had Kirin as well as sake. The taste was the usual to be expected from any other establishments. I have remarked though that I am always satisfied by the taste of Japanese beers: I would say easy to drink yet with a bit more flavor than our run of the mill American beers (Bud, Miller, Coors).  We enjoyed edemame, mussels and clams, as well as beef pot stickers. The edemame could have been a bit more salty, otherwise tasted fresh and flavorfull. The seafood was excellent and the sauce that it was prepared with added an extra level of tasty sweet and salty/spicy flavor to which I would say this appetizer is a must try. The pot stickers were cooked well: they did not seem like they were made of paper, amd had a bit of crispiness to them.  For our entree we enjoyed the white castle roll, a rainbow roll, and a playgirl rool. Also had salmon sashimi. All of the sushi tasted fresh and had a good and clean presentation. The sashimi was given to use with an extra green sauce that was high on the spicy scale, yet went away quite fast: it was not unpleasant. The salmon, again, was fresh tasting. The white castle roll is a definite recommendation: it is good! A bit of crunchy along with some good flavor. The playgirl roll was chosen for my lady as it has avocado on top as well as albacore. It was very good. Rainbow roll was also good: a generic roll with many sashimi flavors on top.  The dining room was clean with plenty of space without feeling cranoed. Our waitress was attentive.",

(Happy hour is all day now on certain days, I think, or is otherwise really lengthy and then paired with reverse happy hour immediately afterward)! They have great deals and innovative rolls. Admittedly it's very Americanized but that doesn't make it any less delicious. The quality has never been lacking in the food in the times that I've went, and they are very generous with their portions. Thick-cut rolls, and lots of pieces in them, not like some rinky-dink four-piece rolls that go for full-price. There are always 8, 10, 12 pieces per roll!  Their eel sauce is also unique. They have some honey in it which is unusual but super yummy. :') The servers are also always attentive and engaging, so no complaints there! Atmosphere is also really nice!",

The food still has the same mid-level sushi snap that you'd expect to find at other places like it (RA, for one) but the management has really let it slide over the past four years.  The servers here are just terrible. Rule #1 of serving, if a customer asks where their food is you apologize. Apologize apologize. Don't berate them, or tell them that it's coming up soon. Treat them like human beings. Usually you see a couple career servers in the place but more often than not you'll find the college-aged bottle blonde screwing up orders and talking to her friends about how expensive rent is in Tempe.  Also, NEVER go to this place between 7pm-9pm, as those are the only two hours that aren't \"happy\" and you'll find yourself being charged top shelf prices for some pureed tuna and loads of mayonnaise (an American sushi tradition I still don't understand).  That brings me to my last gripe. The place used to have 24hr happy hour. It was great, and you didn't go into the dark restaurant worried about paying too for bad sushi. Now, you might get hosed on the regular prices and have to sit in this sticky, dark doldrum while waiting 30 minutes for your food.",

It is displayed at the front counter and often times has to be explained to rude customers in front of us why they do that: they are required to by law. I'd say it's a small price to pay to drink and keep underage kids from recklessness. Not to mention shutting the place down.  As far as the food goes, I don't get sushi anywhere else. Sakebomber is the only place I go! And for good reason! Places like Ra don't even light a candle!! It's authentic with a mix of American persuasion and has great original rolls you won't find anywhere else. The prices really range on what you like. It is a well rounded menu.  As far as service, I've never had any complaints. It does get super busy on Friday nights so I recommend making a reservation to a avoid having to wait. The servers have always been very sweet and like to strike up friendly conversations when the moment warrants it. The managers like to roam and make a point to introduce themselves and are very eager to help if you have any questions.  Bathrooms are small but clean. I always recommend Sakebombers to friends and visiting family.",

    "text": "I go here all the time and it's pretty good... MOST of the time. Other times it is just awful but I will hit the positive first.   The food is very good. I especially like the Cherry Blossom roll (Although it is not on the sushi checklist and I have to write it in every time). Typically a great fresh taste, the wait staff and sushi chefs are mostly pretty friendly. When I order to go It usually doesn't take long. All of the times I've ordered the special it was amazing.   But there are some negatives that make me never want to go back.  1) Menu: Sushi menu is not in alphabetical order, descriptions are not posted online and the checklist does not even list all of the rolls on the menu. I've inquired about this and they are \"redoing\" the menu.  That was over 6 months ago.  Get it together.   2) Now I really don't care that the make you get a wristband at the door but they explain it with a written statement taped to the front desk stating how they were recently busted for a liquor violation. I happened to be doing some research the other day and was on the AZ Department of Liquor's website and did a quick search of all the liquor violations in Tempe for the last 3 years. I didn't see SakeBomber on there. I guess it's not that big of a deal but really, why make up a story?   3) Some of the team members are just plain rude. For instance, the other day I ordered a to-go order. I ordered a Cherry Blossom roll, a tootsie make, an Alaska roll and a shrimp tempura. I should've been suspicious as I repeated \"cherry blossom roll\" twice and the woman kept repeating back simply \"blossom roll\". When I go to pick up my order It is a Boston roll... I'm thinking, no big deal, it was simply a misunderstanding but there is more. The woman at the front makes it into a production going over to another employee to discuss what is going on. After a few minutes the woman comes back and tells me \"I don't know if it was your fault or her fault but we will go ahead and replace this, we are busy so it might take a while.\" I think blaming your customers is probably not the best business practice. I believe these two ladies were the owners from the people I've talked to about it.      On top of that we got a teeny tiny (1 oz cup) side of eel sauce with our tootsie maki so we asked for more. They said it would be 75 cents.  I had already paid so I got 3 quarters out of my wallet and handed it to the lady. At first she forgets it so I bring it up when I double check my order (after we waited to have the order corrected). Then the lady rings it in and makes me pay the few extra cents of tax. Are you kidding me? I left you an 18% tip on a to-go order in acknowledgement of the work you do to put it together. That being said, I expect it to be done right. The order was wrong to begin with, I waited over 30 minutes, you included less eel sauce than if I had been dining in, we willingly pay for more, you forget it and then bring up that I am short 3 cents. Needless to say I was quite irked.  4) No bike rack. It's Tempe. A lot of people ride bikes and as a community, this should be something we encourage. It's good exercise and environmentally friendly. There are programs in Tempe that will help cover the cost of installing a bike rack but judging by their previous behavior and their unwillingness to let 3 cents slide I'm guessing they are WAY to cheap to ever install one.      TL;DR : This place is great. On occasion I will have an absolute horrible experience that would typically cause me to never go back but most of the time it is so great so I forgive them. ... Also, it's right down the street :-)",

Since this place is near the ASU campus, it definitely has a younger of drinking age clientele, who have yet to be exposed to outstanding, and fresh sushi.  This place definitely has mediocre sushi, and it is safe to say I won't be back again.",

Their Lollipop roll is my favorite roll on the planet. It's a mix of fish, crab, with cream cheese & masago, and their spicy ponzu sauce for dipping, wrapped in cucumber. Best. Ever. If they ever discontinued it, I would probably stop going! Ha. It's that good. I also am almost always greeted politely by the GM, Rebecca. She's a sweetheart! She usually forgets and calls me Christine, but it's endearing, so I let it slide ;-)  I love this place! It's usually youngsters that are serving, but they're on top of things, and helpful. Prices are really great during HH, too!  You must try the Lychee martini as well. Not a strong drink, but super delish.",

I came by on a Saturday night with two of my friends at around 9 PM and while we didn't mind waiting for a table, the person at the desk seemed a bit rushed and were asking us if we planned on having any drinks before sitting down at the table. The atmosphere was definitely on the trendy side as I saw a lot of younger folks. At times it felt difficult to make conversation just due to the noise levels.  My friends ordered sushi as well as an udon noodle soup. We thought that the sushi was about average and the udon noodle soup my friend liked. As for my order I got the chicken teriyaki dinner box which was average as well. It did take us a while to get our food and it was quite pricey for what we got. I really hope there are better spots in the Valley to get Japanese food...",

Also I know cream cheese was optional.  I recommend you skip it.  It throws the taste all off.    Service was ok too.  Someone is coaching/directing the staff on what they need to do.   Perhaps there is a checklist in the back reminding them.  However the execution was distracting.   To the staff, here are a few tips:  DON'T put the dirty dishes from the next table on my table while you fill up my water glass.    DON'T take my empty plate away a mere .5 seconds after I grabbed the food from it.  Give me time to put the food in my mouth, chew, swallow, and savor the experience of eating it for another minute before you take my plate away.   Overall I would consider coming back, but for the moderate prices, there's a lot more places to choose from.",

I've only ever been here for a happy hour, so I'm unsure if they always card at the door. They get pretty slammed at times so I totally understand making it easy by putting a wristband on the 21+. This is perfectly acceptable. The host is usually pointing out the special by the door while checking ID's. People need to stop complaining.   The staff is friendly and decently attentive. It's a good place for a date or a group. The food is good. Everything's always been fresh. Their Tootsie, Las Vegas (I always get it without jalapeno), and Dragon rolls are good. Sometimes the Rainbow can be a little dry. I've noticed that the Playgirl can get a little skimpy. I think it comes with avocado and sometimes it hasn't had very much. I think that was the problem. I wish they'd put descriptions of their rolls online. I don't normally do spicy but the Lollipop was good. It's just spicy enough to not be overpowering. Any time I've had the eel nigiri it's been a good texture. Perfectly falls apart in your mouth without being mushy.",

The best thing is their fresh wasabi, which tastes so much better than the usual green glob served. The downside is of course that sashimi is quite expensive.  Their sushi rolls, while creative and decently sized, weren't all that unique. Keep in mind practically all sushi rolls taste similar to me so I won't let that affect my rating.",

We walked in and immediately noticed how uncomfortable warm and stale the restaurant was. We were seated promptly by the friendly hostess and given our menus (which were promptly snatched away by my friend who decided to order for all of us). Now the recent is decent sized, and there were only 3 other tables occupied, but it took between 10 and 15 minutes before we were acknowledged by our server and another 5 before she took our drink orders. Or drinks were quickly brought to us and or appetizers then sushi came quickly after. The server was friendly and adjusted the air for us which made remarkable improvement on our comfort level. For appetizers we had the edamame, which was good, Can't really screw that up though (although I prefer mine cold). We also had the tempura sampler with onion, shrimp, potato, and sweet potato. All were tasty and perfectly cooked. The potato was my favorite. For sushi, we had the dragon roll, evil roll, and the play boy. All were wonderful, but the evil roll was by far my favorite and I loved the sauce it came drowned in. Could have had a bit more heat to it but it was soooo good!",

When he said, \"You're not going to like what I say,\" when I asked what he wanted for dinner, I knew that he would suggest something I had previously complained about.  The time before this, I was appalled that I had to wear a wristband for my (relatively) expensive meal. I'm not going to a club or a concert so having my I.D. scrutinized in 484 different ways then told to wear a paper-plastic bracelet seems really silly.  I did hear it was because they were busted for underage drinking more than once so it's for legitimate reasons. Ok back to the present. We went through the whole wristband crap all over again, were seated by the courteous hostess. So far so good. We ordered Kirin and cheap sake for $7 a pop. Sushi comes out and everything is pretty tasty. Boyfriend got the \"spank me\" and \"playboy\" roll which he finally had to courage to order without embarassment.  After our meal, the hostess and what I assume to be a manager and owner brought out this strawberry sauce smore thingy for free and told us that she has seen us in there a lot and wanted us to keep coming back.  A FAR better experience than before--possibly because it wasn't sakebomber frat night and the hoes were'nt hadn't come out to play but I did rather enjoy myself.",

I've tried several sushi places in the area and the best bang for your buck exists at Sakebomber.  I have tried a majority of their specialty rolls and although I have picked out which are my favorites, I am usually satisfied with trying something new. My absolute favorite is the lollipop roll, then the fiesta roll and spank me roll. The sashimi is very good. You have to ask the sushi chefs if they have any great fish, as the quality of each whole fish is different from the next, and they will let you know if one of the selections is exceptionally good that day. They cut fish fresh most days or every day, so the quality will vary between your visits.  As far as drink selection, it's definitely a girly mixed drink-focused drink menu. If you are looking for high quality alcoholic beverages, don't hold your breath. But if you're looking for a place to have a few drinks over dinner with friends, Sakebomber is a good choice.  Overall, this is usually the first choice for me for sushi, only second when I'm trying a new restaurant.",

    "text": "Yipes!  A \"1-Star\"? How did that happen?  Let me first start off by saying this is NOT for the sushi enthusiast.  If you are looking for good sushi, this should be your absolute last resort.  I can say without boasting that I know good sushi when I taste it, as I have visited many sushi places across the country and worked at a sushi restaurant.  This restaurant is definitely geared more towards the \"hip group of drinking kids\".  And when they say that this place isn't kid-friendly, trust me, IT ISN'T.  My husband and I decided to eat here just on a whim and since we did not have a sitter for our two kids, we had to take them.  We arrived in the early evening, so needless to say, it wasn't too busy and we could be served quickly.  It should be noted also, that although both of my kids were quiet and well-behaved as could be, we were still looked at with disgust from the waitstaff.  My husband and I orderded some edamame and simple rolls while our kids had the teriyaki chicken on a stick. We had also ordered two bowls of rice.  The edamame,of course, was fine, as it is cooked in a microwave and it is really hard to screw that up.  The rolls, on the other hand, were far from greatness. The fish on the roll dry and tasteless.  The \"spicy\" tuna rolls we had ordered did not even contain ANY spice. It was purely chopped up tuna, no joke. My kids would not even finish their first stick of chicken as they didn't like the taste.  I tried it for myself, and I had agree with them.  I couldn't finish a single stick either.  I'm sorry, but how do you screw up teriyaki?  Well, now I know.  Our waiter did forget to bring us our extra bowls of rice, but he sure didn't forget to charge us for them.  The food here just isn't good.  Your restaurant can have all the gimmicky rolls they want, but if your ingredients are bad, then it's all for naught.  It's no wonder why they have jalapenos in their rolls.  It's all to block out the taste of the bad fish.  Overall, if you are looking for a trendy sushi spot, this might be your place, but even then, there are much better \"trendier\" spots out there(RA Sushi, whose sushi is still mediocre at best).  Otherwise steer clear because unless you've had enough sake to numb your tongue of the taste of their sushi, you will definitely be left hungry and unsatisfied.",

    "text": "Ok, so the sushi/food itself only really deserves about 3 stars but the fourth star is what makes my friends and I always come back.  During happy hour sake bombs are $5 and they do amazing $3 shots with cute little fruity names like 'green gummy bear' and 'orange sunkist' now you're never going to get tipsy off of one of their $3 shots...that's why you have a minimum of three! Just think of it this way...if you're out at a club you're going to be spending about $10/shot anyway, but at SakeBombers, you're getting 3 for the price of one...are you following? I guess what is also amazing about this place is that it is RIGHT across the street from my house which means my friends and I can walk and there is real no excuse for anyone to not drink :0) come with some friends for happy hour and have some fun!",

    "text": "Great sushi.   I was surprised about how good the sushi was.  It looked like a converted Village Inn, on the outside (and it was), but do not let that fool you.    Its really good sushi and its nice inside.     And compared to some of the other over priced Sushi places in town, its the best value.     Happy hours are good too",

    "text": "Being a native New Yorker, I am very picky about my food and I must say SakeBomber really surpasses my expectations. Just because the restaurant looks like a \"teen hangout\" corner, don't let that fool you thinking the food will be mediocre. The sushi and rolls are great and the price is reasonable. The food is very fresh, and they come in a good quantity (unlike New York city style sushi haha), and the service is good. What else can I say? I wish i would've eaten there more, because now i have to pay even more for sushi in New York that was just as good in Sakebomber.",
