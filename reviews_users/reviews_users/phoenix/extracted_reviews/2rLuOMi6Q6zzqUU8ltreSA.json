I was able to drink this with no milk whatsoever. It almost had a sweet-ish taste to it. I'm incredibly hard to please in the cold brew area so hats off to first watch.   For breakfast I chose the avocado toast with 2 eggs. I do wish the eggs were cooked a slight bit more. They were almost too yolky which is hard to do. It was like a cracked the egg raw when the gold broke open. It was tasty, but I'd probably ask for no oil next time.   2 members of the party chose the salmon frittata and the salmon Benedict. Both enjoyed their dishes.   We also shared a chocolate chip pancake. they are pretty big so sharing is recommended. They make them with a multigrain batter which I didn't even notice, (one member \"noticed\" but I highly doubt she did.. picky). I thought the pancake was great and not overwhelmed with chocolate.   Decent prices for the food as well. I wish there were some of these near home!",

Other favorites are the Bacado Omelet, and the Farmhouse Hash. Their toast is amazing!  Thick, artisanal bread with fresh preserves.  I'm usually full and end up taking the toast home.    The customer service at this location is amazing!  They have been able to make any substitutions that I have asked for.  I usually get the Day Glow juice (now removed from the menu), but the Morning Meditation juice always sounded interesting but I was afraid of the one of the ingredients (beet juice).  My friend felt the same way so we asked if there was anyway we could try as small sample.  They came out with a fairly large size samples (3 to 4 full sips).  And that is how the Morning Mediation became my new favorite juice.",

If they fixed this, this place would be perfect.",

My friend ordered the breakfast sandwich and I got the lemon ricotta pancakes. The lemon rosemary potatoes she had on her plate were sooo good. She said the breakfast sandwich was done really well. I loved the pancakes. The only other place I have had lemon ricotta pancakes that left your mouth watering is in Vegas. So to now have somewhere close is incredible. The pancakes were ginormous! I couldn't even get through half the meal. It was worth the trip and definitely somewhere I would visit again and refer people to visit.",

You can tell the owners put a lot of thought into the design, decor, service, menu, and flow of the restaurant. Both indoor and outdoor patio seating available. In case there is a wait, there are comfortable seats and a cute little coffee station at the entry.   Menu looked delightful and it was tough deciding what to order. Coffee comes with a carafe and they have a bowl of different flavored creamers as well as fancy sugar. They also provide a cold carafe of water for the table.   Decided to try the kale tonic and was a little nervous it would be too grainy but it was so incredibly fresh, sweet and flavorful! Definitely a must try! For brunch we ordered the Italian omelet which came with sausage, roasted peppers, tomatoes and some kind of cheese, served with a side of lightly seasoned greens. Also ordered the elevated egg sandwich -- omg it was so fresh and good! It came with a side of seasoned potatoes so it was nice and filling. Kids menu also has some great, affordable options. We went with the fresh egg which came with bacon, toast and a small bowl of fruit- generous for around $5.75.   There aren't too many breakfast spots in this part of Tempe so First Watch is an excellent addition and we'll definitely become regulars at this gem!",

I understand that Chef Sean has been with First Watch for five years now, and he is responsible for the inventive dishes on the menu.  The service was fast, efficient and friendly. Maybe their parking lot at this location could be a bit larger, but that's really the only \"negative\" I can think of and it's not really something within their control.  I always go for the seasonal specials (you'll see when you get there) and have never been disappointed.",

Well here we are after a morning at the Desert Botanical Gardens.  Yelps app said no wait so we drove here on purpose and the app was wrong.  We waited about 25 minutes, then finally got seated.  There is limited seating out front and from what I could tell limited parking. We were seated outside on the patio, we weren't asked if that is what we wanted.  The patio is covered, and nice, but you have people with their dogs sitting next to you (I do love dogs), but one of our table mates on the patio had a barking dog and my quite relaxing meal was interrupted. The other thing that bothered me is that the people waiting to be seated are staring at you. Okay the food and the service are the reasons why this restaurant got 3 stars and not 1.  Our waitress was very nice, answered all of our questions and provided fast timely service.  The food was very good, but I have had better at other restaurants in the area. I think the damper that kind of pushed me over the edge was the fact that we were not given a choice of where to sit. If was a few weeks ago it would have been too hot to sit outside in the heat.  I really think the people who do the seat planning should be asking  their customers where they would like to sit, like they do a million places all over AZ.  Will we be back.  not to this location.",

They have something for everyone whether you want a traditional breakfast, a quick mid morning snack, or something you've never tried before. Don't be afraid to try a new dish here, they execute them very well with a multitude of modifications to choose from. So far the pot roast hash has been excellent and a perfect example of a dish I have never tried before. The Eggs Benedict are also very good, makes me excited to try a lot of their other meals they offer like their multi-grain pancakes and quinoa bowls.         The environment is very warm and inviting, and the servers are excellent as they always ask if you need anything else with your meal. Make sure to tip them well, they have great customer service skills and very helpful, especially when it's your first time you visit.

I rated so low because while I was there with a friend for lunch we were appalled by what I'm assuming were trainers for the servers since they had just opened. We were there for a while so we got to see quite a showing. The trainers would stand with or behind our server. They would critique the server's performance while still standing at our table. It was incredibly awkward for my friend and I, as well as other customers. We didn't notice anything wrong with the service provided either. Our server was friendly and knowledgeable when we asked questions. The trainers would consistently nitpick about this or that. Not too kindly either... Honestly it was making my friend and I anxious that WE would say something wrong. I just can't support a company that treats it's employees the way we saw when they were only two days into opening... I would have rated one star for all the disrespect we saw in the hour and a half we were there, but the food really was delicious. If you do end up going: the Chickichanga, Biscuits and Gravy, and Kale Tonic are all delicious. Don't forget to tip the servers well! These people definitely deserve it!",

I wanted something light and got their soup of then day - perfect after the gorge fest that is thanksgiving. So nice. Servers were awesome. And watching the crew in the kitchen work well together from our seats nearby, who showed great professionalism, was also nice to see. So happy this new place is nearby.",

Each is unique, style wise; the Tempe location has a community table & really big booths & sadly needs more parking (we all had to park across the street in another lot but, it's ok. Needed to walk a little aft eating). The Scottsdale site is located in a shopping center, so parking is not an issue but the booths are smaller,  needing 2 tables together to fit the 8 of us. Service is excellent at both & the food delicious.  The bacon is so good, I literally have to fight off my grandchildren to keep them from stealing mine. Our daughter loves the Avocado Toast!  There's something for everyone,  from the cage free eggs to the  healthy menu to the vegetarian to the traditional bacon & eggs with toast. The jelly is made in house & delicious.  A bit more pricey than the chain restaurants but, definitely worth it.",

The hostess was more involved with her college friends than to pay attention to my wife and I, who had put ourselves on the waitlist via Yelp.  Once seated, our server was nonexistent. Our food took nearly 40 minutes to come off the line from the time we ordered. Mind you, the couple that sat down next to us 20 minutes after we were seated had their food in under 15. And no, we didn't order the world -- just an entree each, one a hash scramble and the other a turkey burger. But items take less than 15 to cook, make and plate. Obviously our server was not on it.   For the hype, go somewhere else. In fact, the wife and I joked that we should've just gotten breakfast at the Jack in the Box down the road from our hotel... It would have been better and a heck of a lot quicker (and that statement says a lot).",

I will attribute most of my negative experience to the terrible service by our waitress Rachel, however, I wasn't impressed with the food either. I ordered the traditional breakfast with scrambled eggs. The \"scrambled\" eggs were runny and still had the yolk. I would have sent them back, but our waitress disappeared for 30+ minutes and never came back to check on us after the food was brought out. I eventually went to the front desk to ask for our check. A different waitress (Jessica - she was great!!) quickly delivered our check and apologized for the poor service. With all that said, I think I'd rather drive an extra 15 miles to the Phoenix location for better service.",

    "text": "If you are an individual who has lived near Mill avenue for over a decade you have to realize how incronguous it is to have a nice breakfast place open in you area. At one time breakfast, a decent breakfast, was not to be had in the area. Over time that has changed, with places like Ncounter at the top of Mill and Snooze on College avenue. Well, you can add First Watch to that list. It has taken the place of what was once a bicycle sales and repair shop and it is great!  I actually heard from a neighbor that they were doing a family and friends opening with donations to Phoenix Children's hospital in place of paying for the meal. I planned to go in Sunday so stopped by today and ended up staying for breakfast. I have never eaten at a First Watch before and found this place was airy and open with a friendly staff and even though I was warned it is in the testing phase excellent service all around.   I had the Italian Omelette, that comes with a small green salad and toast, along with the a fresh squeezed juice (also amazing), and coffee. Right off the bat I liked that they give you a small carafe for the coffee so you can pour as you need it and the coffee stays hot and it is good coffee. They do a similar thing with the water, giving you a glass bottle from which you can also pour as needed so you never have to wait for a refill, which I like a lot!   The  toast does come buttered so if you want it dry you probably need to ask for it and I also like that a small side of fresh jam comes with the toast, which is a whole grain variety and delicious. As for the Omelette, tasty though I would like the mozzarella to  be a bit more gooey to hold everything together but it tasted great.  Another big thing, the prices are quite reasonable. My omelette breakfast, by itself, was about $10 and the coffee, before tax, is $2.75 so you can eat a decent breakfast for $20 or less. I, for one, intend to be a regular Sunday breakfast person at First Watch and I'm happy to have it as another high quality breakfast option for the ASU community. As it opens at 7 am as older folks in the area can get in and have quiet breakfast before the rest of the ASU community is up and headed out to start the day. Welcome to the neighborhood First Watch! :-)",

I chose the multi grain pancake with blueberries along with the million $ bacon.  But what totally won me over was the morning meditation juice. It reminded me of a tequila sunrise only this was healthy. The one item I was unsure of was the beet juice and even asked if they would make it without it, but was convinced  by the waiter to try. I am so glad I did.  Never thought I would have beet juice but the mixture with orange and lemon juice, turmeric and ginger was an excellent combination. My coworker had the chicken chimmichurri hash which she indicated was excellent as well   Definitely looking forward to another business trip to Phoenix. My only question is when will they expand to Southern California!",

    "text": "uuuggghhhhh!!!  The thing I don't like about this place is that I don't have one where I live so I can't eat here all the time.    This is my kind of breakfast place.  Some days you want to be good and have a balanced good for you breakfast and other days you want to have pancakes or french toast with lots of butter and syrup.  I super appreciate that they give you the option.  I ordered the morning market vegetable omelet.  Excellent.  The veggies were super flavorful and had the right amount of crisp.  An omelet can be kind of rich so the roasted tomatoes and goat cheese really gave it a nice acidic zing.  I also LOVE when my breakfast includes a side salad.  Mixed greens with a simple vinaigrette are where it's at for me.  IMO, this should be a commonplace thing and not something I can only get when I go to Southern California or Europe.    The other dishes in my party were really good as well.  The summer menu has an Elote Mexican Street Corn Hash that was killer.  SOOOO good.  Again, perfect balance of flavor.  The only reason this place didn't get a 5 star from me was the service.  I understand that all the servers were on the younger side (ours was definitely early college aged wearing a side ponytail with a baby blue scrunchie) but that's no excuse for sub par service.  She was around and visible but not very attentive.  Complete aside... I really LOVE their website.  I usually don't count calories but I happen to be at this moment in time and you can click on the menu items to see the calorie counts and manipulate your order.  Example: my omelet was about 800 calories.  If I didn't eat the toast it's down to about 500.  If I changed from whole egg to egg whites, it's now at about 300.  I can usually guess the numbers myself but it's awesome that they can help you out.",

Not sure what happened in their system though.... Yelp said we had 3 parties ahead of us, then 2, then 1, but then it went back up to 2... then stayed at 1 for a while, even though we saw at least 3 parties go through. We figured the system was pushing us bask since we \"requested\" outdoor seating, but we could also clearly see an empty seat on the patio with the menus ready and everything...This whole time we are sitting in the waiting area watching all these people go ahead of us. It was SO frustrating to sit there hungry as heck. After ~45 min of waiting, a waiter came up and asked us if we were on the list because he noticed we had been waiting for quite awhile. After that he seated us, and the meal was pretty good. Very filling.   Overall, the place was a nice sit down place. The parking lot was atrocious, and I would just suggest putting your name down when you get there in person because the Yelp thing obviously didn't work. Maybe try a different location, especially on the weekend, since this one is so busy with college students.",

One of the older girls, Alki, insisted that this was the place to be and that she challenges herself to get something new each time. Since then I've returned multiple times with family and friends!  While I try to try new things like Alki did, I found that the Farmhouse Skillet was my True favorite First Watch dish. There's something about the sizzling meat and potatoes that hits the spot every time. The accompanying toast + jam and fruit is refreshing and a welcoming taste change from the savory skillet.  Definitely check out First Watch if you're in Tempe and you want options that are healthier while still maintaining flavor.",

The lemon chia muffin was great though. I wouldn't order this again, but it was only like $8 I think? So not going to ruin my day! My boyfriend got the chia pudding and it was also very good.

I ended up not being able to finish this since there was so much! The banana crunch granola, multigrain pancakes were delicious!

If they had some more \"craft\" non-alcoholic morning juice cocktails then I'd be tempted to comeback and try them. Overall, it was a pleasant, cute place to eat with good service. There was a couch by the host stand for us to sit at while we waited for a friend which was helpful.",

My son told me he and his brother had Miles as their server the last time they were there and he was just as bad. If I'm spending $30 on breakfast for two people please at least try to fake it.

Honestly, from past memory I was remembering the restaurant as a dated, average breakfast place. It's not! Totally cute and such a great menu with a lot of fresh options. Seriously, every time we go I want to try the whole menu. The waffles and french toast are both AMAZING! I counterbalance with the Tri-Athlete breakfast, which has a lot of flavor for what it is.  As far as this location, it's a hidden gem. We couldn't think of anywhere else to go on a Saturday morning besides Snooze and were promptly told it would be over an hour wait. Um, no. Knowing how yummy First Watch is, we were pleasantly surprised to find this location right down the street with a 10 minute wait. Boom!   Parking is a little tricky since the lot isn't very big, but we found a spot on the street. FYI - Chick Fil A doesn't have any signs that we saw but there was a guy in the parking lot writing down plate numbers, so best to just find other parking.",

My mom and I got the Belgian waffle with strawberry compote, strawberries and whipped cream on it, and it was to-die-for!  Lightly crisp on the outside, and tender on the inside.  Yummy!!  My daughter got the lemon ricotta pancakes, which were amazing, and my sister got Greek yogurt with chia seeds and assorted berries on top, which was also very yummy!  I can't wait to go back and try something different!  Everything was amazing!!",

(Come to find out there was a run happening and thats why it wasn't as crowded as it typically is; although they started to pile in as we left:))  I ordered the salmon and roasted veggie Frittata & my sister had the pesto chicken quinoa power bowl. Both were so delicious...as always! I mix my green salad with my frittata & it always tastes so good. I love the chive drizzle that goes on top of the frittata. I think its made in house. We both had their new juice called the Blue Booster and as always it was fresh, yummy and had lots of antioxidants in it. Our waiters name was Mile's and he was really nice, ask for him if you go to this location, he's very helpful & will make your experience a great one!",

They could easiest fit more tables in there but I like the vibe.  We were waited on timely. The coffee is good coffee (after all a breakfast place needs good coffee).  The food is beautiful. There were so many unique choices it was hard to decide. I ended up with the Benedict Florentine.  My complaint was the yolk was hard. It was more of a hard boiled egg.  Also there was maybe a tablespoon of avocado in between the two eggs.  Disappointing when these are two big parts of the Benedict.  We also had the turkey biscuits and gravy.  Think thanksgiving turkey gravy meets white breakfast gravy.  It was very good. Well seasoned on freshly baked biscuits.  Would I go back? Absolutely but I'd order something else.",

I know I do and Frist Watch is literally right down the street from me.   I started off with a glass of Morning Mediation, this is the only way to drink your oj! It is freshly squeezed orange & lemons with turmeric, organic ginger, agave nectar and some beet, but don't let the beet fool ya, this drink is what a sunrise would taste like. So fresh and yummy!  I also ordered some Million Dollar Bacon to share, these are amazing strips of bacon baked with brown sugar, black pepper and cayenne then drizzled with maple syrup. Oh soo good!  For my meal I ordered the Elote Mexican Street Corn hash, which was seasoned potatoes, roasted summer corn, chorizo and scallions topped with 2 over easy eggs and comes with warm tortillas, even though it's not 100% like Elote, this hash is pretty yummy for breakfast!  So far everything I have had at Frist Watch has not disappointed, can't wait to keep trying out their menu!",

I had already eaten breakfast before my brunch date with friends, so I was looking for something light. The coconut pudding fruit bowl (I can't remember the actual name of the item) looked exactly like what I was looking for.  The presentation was gorgeous when my food arrived. However, one bite and I knew that this was not going to the light mid-morning snack I wanted. The coconut pudding was incredibly thick and nothing like the fluffy pudding I was imagining. The chia seeds also added to its heaviness. Although the taste of the pudding, berries, and granola was great, I really couldn't handle the thick texture. Moving on, I tried the almond buttered toast. Again, it was sticky and thick. I really wanted to like this creative twist on a fruity snack, but I just couldn't handle the texture. If the coconut pudding could be made to resemble the smooth texture of yogurt, it would go down a lot better.",

Food was amazing- nicely well seasoned and just the right temperature. I had expected the chickichangas to be a little spicier (it wasn't spicy at all) but they still had good flavor without much kick. The side of potatoes made it a lot of food, so prepare to get a box. I personally don't like my potatoes too crispy, so these were perfect. I couldn't finish them or my fruit cup, but I still regret not getting a side of bacon. Next time...",

What I have noticed about a lot of breakfast/brunch places around the valley is that they are more trendy, picture perfect spots to eat with your friends and grab a mimosa instead of offering healthy, fresh food. That's why I choose First Watch because it offers farm fresh items on their menu which do not go un-noticed. I always feel regenerized and healthy upon leaving.   I start my breakfast off by ordering the morning meditation drink which you HAVE to try if you are at First Watch. I was a little nervous reading what was in it: beets, turmeric, etc. but seriously it is one of the most delicious and refreshing drinks I have ever ordered.   I have gotten the farmhouse skillet every time and absolutely love this dish. I am a HUGE skillet fan and this skillet is something I crave all the time. It offers two eggs any style, bacon, cheese, tomatoes, potatoes, and avocados. YUM. Toast, fresh jam, and some fruit also is included in the meal.   Overall I would give this place more stars if Yelp would let me!",

The freshness of everything was awesome! My daughter tried The Traditional with extra crisp bacon and was NOT disappointed! Super food and huge plate of food that she couldn't finish! The ambience was awesome- very hip and decorated beautifully. We sat at a comfortable booth that had a painting of a multicolored rooster hanging next to us that i thought was one of the coolest paintings I've seen in a while! Everyone that worked here was awesome as well- from the hostess who sat us to the waiter ( I think his name was Johnny ) even excellent service carried through to paying the bill at the front. Everything was great and we just found ourselves a new breakfast place. So much to try on the menu! We will definitely be back!",

The waiter was cool and gave us a sample of the Kale Tonic, which was also more citrus-y. They give you an adorable glass jug of water but it's just tap so, gross haha.   I had the giant Pumpkin Pancake and it was yummy. More like dessert but that's how I like my pancakes. The chicken sausage was weird and the eggs were cold so the yolks weren't really runny. Sourdough toast with fruit preserves was good but nothing out of the ordinary.  Millionaire's bacon - sweet & peppery served with a drizzle of their tasty syrup Cheesey grits - No flavor other than the melted cheese on top. It was more like a corn cake than the runny version of grits I've tried once before. Weird. Not a fan, even with salt. Farmer's Biscuit Sandwich - really interesting, the sweet spiced apple butter is a nice compliment to the savory sausage and the biscuit was great, not too dry. Potatoes on the side are good when they're still hot and crispy.   My only complaint is the food was cold by the time I tried a bite of everything. It was really cold in the restaurant so maybe that's why, but cold eggs and toast and bacon are disappointing.",

The hollandaise on the eggs was scrumptious. I wish there was more, but it would have added more calories. The Florentine included fresh baby spinach, avocado, and vine ripened tomato. The tomato was a slice rather than diced.   My friend went for the tri-athlete entree. I liked the fresh fruit that came with her meal. There was blackberries, purple grapes, pineapple, blueberries, and honey dew.   I liked that the restaurant was pretty quiet and the service was quick. The parking lot is a bit small and could get crowded quickly. The interior of the restaurant was larger than I had expected initially.",

I found my salvation with a quinoa bowl and threw an avocado on the plate as a pinch batter for the meat. Homerun!

Coffee is refillable but cold coffee is not. I don't understand the price/quantity difference.  Its like charging 10$ for two pancakes.

The line wasn't too long but we opted for putting our name on the list via yelp. It saved us tons of time and once we arrived, the table was ready.  Places like this are great because you pay a comparable price to a chain place, but the quality is way better.  Feels fresh, clean, and friendly. Not the best egg sandwich I have ever had, but it definitely came close. The egg was runny as expected and the toast was on point. Get the elevated egg sandwich if you can't pick something on the menu. Nice place to visit for an out of visitor from Los Angeles.",

I was beyond impressed when our server noticed the eggs on my Benedict may be overdone  and acknowledged it, instead of having to flag her down, and promptly had my meal replaced and comped it without me asking. WOW. I hope this is becoming the new (old) normal.    We were a party of five and enjoyed the biscuits and gravy, omelettes and three Benedict dishes.   Overall, the eggs were delicious and well prepared.   Unfortunately it was a bit too cold to enjoy the adorable patio out front but the decor inside was comfortable and inviting.",

I also tried their Morning Meditation juice which has beets, orange, organic ginger, lemon, agave nectar, and turmeric- just what I needed as a mid-morning pick-me-up.  In addition to their yummy food, they provide great service! Our waiter Manuel had great vibes and was so helpful.",

    "text": "2/24/2017 Yelp review First Watch Tempe AZ 61 W. Thomas Road Phoenix, AZ 85013  (602) 265-2092  Since the first time I've been to First Watch I've always had good quality food and good service. I ordered the elevated egg sandwich which is served with seasoned potatoes. The bacon, avocado, mayo, and cheese were refreshing to my taste buds. All the ingredients they use are fresh and their eggs are cage-free. I enjoyed the sandwich because I feel good after eating it, it is not heavy and greasy like other places I've been to. Instead the food fills you up in a good way. The eggs were cooked over- easy so when you bite into it the yolk will dress the other ingredients perfectly. The portion of each ingredient is made so with every bite you can enjoy the pairing of egg, bacon, cheese, mayo, and arugula. The seasoned potatoes melt in your mouth because they're so light and soft. I recommend this dish to any sandwich lovers out there!   A group of four of us were seated right away which is perfect for a college student who has a tight schedule and needs something quick they had really helpful service. The pricing is a little pricier than some places but it is worth the few extra dollars. You pay for the fresh ingredients and incredible service. I ordered the elevated egg sandwich which was $9.49. They have a range of drinks to order such as; coffee, tea, soda, and they even have a fresh juice bar. When you first sit down they ask if anyone would like coffee instead of just offering you a cup they provide you with a large pot and even provide you with a bowl of different creams. Other items for breakfast/brunch range from 7.99-10.79. The presentation was appealing to the eye and you can tell the work they put into each dish. The vibrant colors of the food made it look mouth-watering and the seasoned potatoes on the side were a crisp golden brown. I also ordered an appetizer that was a little out of my comfort zone it was an AM superfoods bowl. For a breakfast appetizer, it was a little overpriced in my opinion. It was a little over six dollars. The bowl itself is very pretty and balanced with crunch and sweetness. It looks just like the picture that advertises it on the wooden table.    The atmosphere of First Watch is earthy and friendly. The decor of the restaurant is what give it the earthy tone, it is decorated perfectly with wooden tables and benches on the inside and you can even enjoy your meal outside near Mill Avenue. The plates and silverware are simple and make the food pop. The service at First Watch makes you feel at home and the past few times I've been there I've got nothing but incredible servers.  First Watch is one of my favorite places to go for breakfast/brunch and I recommend it to everyone!",

Hubby got the Trifecta and loved it. He also got a plain hot coffee - said it was good but nothing to write home about. I got the traditional Eggs Benedict with potatoes and an extra side of hollandaise. The benny was a large portion and delicious. Hollandaise was really lemony and not as rich as I'd like, but the flavors still balanced really well together with the potatoes. Sweet & Creamy iced coffee was amazing and just how Iike it :D",

He doesn't say anything, just walks away to grad it. Hands it to me, and let's me know my total. No additional comments, courtesy questions, nothing. I looked in my bag, and noted there was no plastic utensils so I had to ask the guy. He seemed annoyed that he'd have to go get them out of the back but then remembered there may be some at the cashier stand.   Once I got to work, I was bummed I didn't ask for ketchup for the potatoes. Oh well. Wish it would've been included or at least offered.   I ordered the chickichanga. Very good. Very fresh. Potatoes were fresh too. Even the hair I found in my food seemed to be fresh. Sigh.   Oh well. Hopefully the service and experience are better for everyone else today.",

Maybe I'll love it after I eat!  After eating review:  Pros:  Hostess (mel?) Exactly what you want,  very welcoming,  all the staff very nice & friendly.   I ordered the traditional. My eggs not correct,  bacon cold, didn't bring toast and than when they did, pre-made up...cold, butter not melted.   My husband and I also shared a pancake  , that came out first no syrup,  I finally got up to ask Hostess.   Our waiter was new, never a problem we all have to start somewhere,  but the whole team must be new! We had several attempts of others people's food been delivered,  ours to there table.   Our waiter took our order promptly,  and than never really came back.  Never brought water or creamer for coffee,  looking around other tables really didn't have service either.   The food took forever.   I gave my feedback to the Hostess,  super professional & sweet, offered a comp on the bacon, we are not those people, we still ate all the food, I was starving! Lol  I don't live in the area and will probably not be back,  but hopefully in a couple months they stabilize!   I still love First watch and will continue to eat there. I think the food service was purely since they are new location.",

We were greeted right away and they invited us to grab coffee and water at a serving station nearby which I thought was awesome. Gerardo was our server and he was great. Very attentive and patient while we looked over the menu. I ordered the traditional breakfast with turkey sausage and gluten free bread. The potatoes were cooked to perfection just as were the eggs. My girlfriend ordered the breakfast tacos and was still extremely satisfied even after finding an egg shell in one of them. It happens and trust me an eggshell isn't the worst thing you can find in your food so we didn't make a big deal out of it. Gerardo was apologetic and accommodating and brought her out another order which was greatly appreciated. All in all, I love this location. The  food and customer service was great and I'll definitely return with more friends next time.   Thanks ya'll! Keep up the great work!",

Thankfully they serve some good traditional breakfast food, perhaps a little too formulaic and \"safe\", but a pancake and bacon dish will delight. The coffee is a bit poor, but like most US eateries, they tend to go heavy on the filter blends and less on the higher grades of beans. If it was my restaurant - the coffee would be a much higher quality.  My American colleague was underwhelmed, but then, he's been spoiled with Mexican breakfasts.  In conclusion it's ok, but nothing that would earn a Michelin star.",

The dish, I believe is inspired by the Turkish menemen, but it was as good as what I had anywhere in Turkey... the dish was served in a pretty ceramic oven proof dish with a side of salad (i substituted with potatoes)... the tomato sauce under the perfectly cooked sunny side up eggs was perfectly prepared, with the right acidity, and peppers and herbs! It was the best thing I dipped my perfectly prepared ciabatta bread for a long while (that is how you eat menemen, btw...) we were so excited that we asked to meet the Manager, Hector, who was great to chat and obviously cared about how his food tasted...  KUDOS TO FIRST WATCH! Please keep menemen on the menu. We will be back to try more things and enjoy your wonderful coffee!!!",

My BLT eggs Benedict had the perfect amount of hollandaise sauce, and with just a hint more bacon could have been PERFECT. The kids meals are very generous and come with a drink.

We won't be back, but it definitely has a wide selection of more country style foods. It ended up being 20 dollars for an entree, coffee and tea.",

The dish was beautifully plated with the toast (whole-grain bread, avocado, and sea salt) and two over easy eggs.   I had to add a lot of salt and pepper to add flavor.   Husband ordered a ham and gruyere omelet which he said was fairly devoid of flavor.  I'd still love to come back, because there were some other options that looked delicious.

I mean it was so cold that my hot chocolate was cold by the time my food came out. I started eating. The food was very good but it was cold after I'd eaten one slice of bacon and 2-3 bites of my omelet. I didn't finish  because my food got cold so fast it was no longer good. I had to leave the restaurant to stand outside in the August (Tempe) heat to warm up. I've heard restaurants make the place extra cool so patrons resist lingering longer, but this was beyond ridiculous. What a waste of good food and hard earned money. If you eat here, order cold food and bring a zero degree parka!",

    "text": "1st time to try First watch.  I ordered eggs Benedict Florentine.  I asked if possible to scramble my eggs.  I expressed to my server how I DONT like runny eggs not fully cooked.  I expressed to the server I like the eggs fully whipped together before cooking.  When it came out I saw the eggs were cooked on the stovetop long enough to chop them up and be able to put them on the bread & tomato.  They were covered with hollandaise sauce and when I pointed out to the server the eggs were still runny, he said it was just the hollandaise sauce.  You could CLEARLY see wet yellow yolk on the plate.  He asked if I wanted to send it back and I said no.  I have developed a healthy fear of what a server or cook may do to the food if the customer doesn't like it.  I pushed the runny eggs off to the side and ate the bread, tomato and 3 pieces of avocado.  We needed a coffee carafe refill and our server had disappeared.  I asked a different worker if he would please bring us a refill.  He gladly did.",

They're massive but too delicious to pass up! The only thing that has been slightly annoying is the service can be pretty slow. Because it's my favorite place, I go pretty often but sometimes it takes 10 minutes for a server to even greet us. But the food comes out quickly and it never disappoints. Also, the parking kind of sucks and I often have to park somewhere on Mill Ave and walk over since only a few spots are available.",
