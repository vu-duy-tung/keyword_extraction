The food was nice and fresh, but I feel like the burger could have been seasoned a little more. The fries were pretty good, nice and crispy, and I do recommend getting the Stand sauce to go with them.

The meat on both tacos were a little dry but a good size. I love street corn and was happy with all the toppings they included: butter, cotija cheese, green onions, mayo, and a chile powder.   The second time I ordered the burger, fries, and chips and guac. I absolutely love their burger! I got it with cheese, caramelized onions, and roasted jalepenos ($.75 extra charge) and it was one of the best burgers I've ever gotten at a drive-thru! If you get the burger, you MUST get the fries because they are freshly cut and seasoned to perfection. Be prepared to be full afterward, also. The guac is different; there is corn mixed in, which gives it sweet and tangy flavors all in one. I liked it! Definitely love this place but would get the burger over the tacos.",

We tried: The Stand burger with fried jalapenos, bacon and gluten free bun.  My husband LOVED it.  Veggie taco was amazing.  The yellow squash topped with pickled cabbage, cilantro and cojita cheese.  Squeeze the fresh lime on top.  Mmmmmm.... I didn't receive any salsa which I wish I had but it was still very good.  French fries were outstanding.  I was worried since some reviews stated pepper on them.  I do not like pepper but these were perfectly sliced and perfectly fried and seasoned.  So good.  I wish I could have eaten more of them.  Was to full for the two of us to finish the serving.  Chocolate Chili milkshake was strange.  A Mexican hot chocolate flavor with cinnamon.  I don't care for cinnamon.  The burn when it went down your throat was exciting though.  Hubby wouldn't put it down.  He was in heaven.  Salted Dulce De Leche milkshake was so so so good.  Can't wait for another one.  We had a groupon or deal chicken or something and hope to see another one soon but will be back either way.  It was HOT and we were forced to sit outside on the air conditioned patio because the 4 tables inside were taken.  The air conditioning blowing straight on you helped but it still wasn't comfortable.  Service was very attentive and the owner or manager seemed very friendly.",

Because it's Made the old fashioned way with real ice cream, heaps of salty sweet caramel goodness and local love, I have to assume it's low in calories and recommended by state and federal health authorities alike.  Regardless it's delicious and worth your four hundred pennies.  The burgers and fries are also quite good--I'd compare them to a rich man's N-n-Out.  Greasey goodness with some some fresh fixings with less of the assembly line feel/taste of the chain.  The owner is remarkably attractive and fit for someone who owns/works at a fast food establishment.  Hence my assumption about the milkshakes resulting in good healthy and longevity.",

They have a special between 11am-3pm, you get a free side of fries. Free!? Sure I'll take it. Should've actually left it, if cooked fully, it wouldn't have been bad. But over half of the fries were way under cooked, a few were still raw.  But what I really wanted from The Stand was the Dulce de Leche shake. I'm a big sweet and salty fan, plus ice cream? This is up my alley. Five bucks was on the high side, but it didn't disappoint. It looked NO WHERE near the picture posted on the main business page here. It was extra blended and the guy actually wiped up the side before handing it over (thank you for that). Regardless, it was delicious! I'll be returning for the shake only.",

The owners have had plenty of time to sort out these kinds of issues, and they just haven't. I don't know if it's bad luck, incompetence, or a mix - but I will steer clear of The Stand in the future. I hope they can resolve the problems because the food is good. But it's not worth the trouble when there are plenty of other good options in the area.",

I wasn't feeling a burger so I ordered one chicken taco and one short rib. I also got fries on the side and a small horchata. The best thing about the meal was the fries and horchata! The tacos were OK. I probably wouldn't order them again. I do have to mention though, that they were generously filled with meat which is great and they double the tortilla. So if you like them they're worth it! I guess I'm just super picky about tacos!   Beside the food I ordered, I also knocked down a star because I was super looking forward to getting a street corn. That is my absolute fave and for a restaurant near me to offer that literally would've made my life! But to my disappointment they were all out :(   I do love that they have a drive thru so I'll be back to get a corn, and maybe to try their burgers. I'll update my review if so! :)",

They are identical to InN Out's . And two soft drinks.  The Burger's were delicious hot and mouth watering. The fries though they look like In N Out 's. They are much better and crunchy. Regretted getting just one order. Definitely recommend this place and we will be back for sure. The staff very friendly and courteous. Was informed by a staff member that they have another location in Scottsdale they serve taco's at that location. Good job folks keep it up.",

The Stand used to remind me of the killer burgers that my dad used to make.  Flavorful, unctuous, sinful, memorable.  But now the quality is subpar.  The meat is disrespected and over cooked and under seasoned.  And now they've taken tacos off the menu?  Sad.  I feel like this location is gearing up for closure.

But it seems as though The Stand isn't what it used to be. Gone are the delicious tacos. Gone is the consistency in the food. Gone is the amazing and friendly service.   Our visits to The Stand used to include a burger and fries for my husband and tacos for me. On a recent visit, we learned that The Stand was no longer serving tacos but we could \"just drive to the new location to get tacos.\" Mind you the new location is a good 20 minutes away. Not just a quick hop over there. We've found the quality of the previously delicious burger to only be so-so and very inconsistent. When we tried to order the '36 St. fries\" the staff couldn't fulfill our order because they didn't have anything to serve it in. Seems a little odd to not have proper plates for their food.   We did check out the food stall at \"The Bar\" which is run by The Stand. Excellent food and service. I think we'll be frequent visitors there more often.

There is one burger the Standard  which comes with 2 patties and a few options to that which the Carmelized onions are pretty good. The burger is very tasty with the char flavor off the grill loaded with lettuce and tomatoes. I tried the short rib taco with Pico De Gallo and was pretty good.  Also had their chocolate shake and french fries. Chocolate Shake was nice and thick and came with a boba straw. The fries were crispy and good.  The main item seems to be the burgers which are pretty good so there are so many burger restaurants in the Arcadia area this one is overshadowed but on a different level from the gourmet burger restaurants and they seem to be just a casual small local owned restaurant.

We always used to get a taco to share with our burgers and often would get chips n salsa which are now also gone. The staff told us the new location in Scottsdale would have tacos but we come here because it's local and won't be driving to Scottsdale to get tacos. The fries were so greasy today I had to wipe my fingers after each fry.   I hope The Stand returns to form as it really was great when it opened but after today's experience I wouldn't rush back as I have in the past.",

    "text": "It's official. As of today, The Stand is my top burger joint in Phoenix.   I stopped here on my first trip out to The Valley, and it's turned into a regular stop ever since I moved here.   The burgers are perfect. They're not too heavy on the meat and not overwhelmed by toppings. There's a perfect balance happening between those buns. A bigger patty or more patties does Not mean a better burger. Someone should put out that memo. I've never had a dry burger here either. They're always tender and juicy.   My verdict is still out on the fries, but I don't come here for the fries so it's kind of a non-issue for me.   The shakes are great. I've had a plain vanilla a couple of times, and hear the dulce de leche is the cow's moo, so I'll be trying that at some point.   If you're feeling Mexicany, the short rib tacos are good. I'm not well versed enough in taco to say how well they stack up against others in the area, but I liked them. The Mexican corn has also been a go-to. Very good.   It's worth mentioning that the people that work here have always been friendly on my visits. At times I've experienced an almost sickening amount of smiley and bubbly here. That's not a bad thing. An aversion to overly happy people is my own cross to bear, and I won't take it out on them.  On the whole, when I think about it, the Stand is my top stop in Phoenix... period.",

    "text": "After my friend Zak helped me with a ride from the airport I offered him a meal to pay him back. Which is how we ended up at The Stand. After pondering whether to get a burger or Mexican I decided to get the cheeseburger with grilled onions and fries.  The fries were pretty great and are a step or two above your In N Out style fries. The burger on the other hand was a bit of a letdown. It was strange because it looked like a great burger and had all the elements needed to be amazing but in the end..... the taste kinda fell flat.   + Toasted Bun + Lotta Juice  - Sauce didn't really add anything  - Burger became a heavy tasting slog towards the finish line  What was more interesting to me then the food was the interior and the bright blue walls of this place. Cool interior and concept that echoes the Echo Park area in LA but sadly the food execution wasn't there. It's the food that lumps it into the likes of 5 Guys, Smashburger, and The Habit of good - not great burger places.  Don't get me wrong eating here wasn't a bad experience; it just wasn't an exceptional one. (But come for the blue walls!)",

    "text": "Good *little* spot for tasty burgers and tacos.   I see lots of people checking in here all the time, and they've got a solid four star rating, of course I wanted to check the place out. Then deal chicken had a run on burgers apparently and were selling $20 to The Stand for just $10, so we bought it. I hate to waste a good deal, so we planned to visit for dinner one day, missed it and planned the next week, over and over. Finally, we landed here for lunch on a random Thursday.   Is it better than an In-N-Out? I don't know, but it was pretty close in taste, and bigger in size. Who doesn't like bigger? This IS America, right? Everything was fresh, tasty, and I left feeling like I'll be back at some point in the near (or distant) future - who knows.  We tried a couple of the ($3) short rib tacos, delish'. A ($5.50) burger with cheese, and we added ($.75) grilled jalapenos to it, also a great idea if you want to spice it up a bit. $2 will buy you an order of Mexican corn, a (half) ear of corn covered with chipotle mayo, cheese, and chili powder. A reasonable sampling of their menu, and over all it was a great (unhealthy) meal.  After ordering, we stood off to the side for a few minutes chatting while waiting for our order to be called, and waited, and waited some more. Before I even realized we weren't getting our order, the lady behind the counter asked me what we had ordered, I guess she noticed us standing there, and everyone else getting their orders filled. I probably would have gone another 5 minutes or so before realizing. Apparently the POS (point of sale)  ;-) forgot to print out the order for the kitchen. Great service, I thought. Thanks for noticing!  My only issue with The Stand is the extreme limited seating. During lunch, and I can only imagine I was not the only person annoyed with this, there was a consistent line of about 5 groups of people ordering food, with only 4 tables inside to sit. Probably not a big deal eight months of the year, but August is definitely not one of those eight wonderful Phoenix months. I am not about sitting outside on a patio during lunch, sweatin to the oldies, and then heading back to work, no thanks. Adding insult to injury, there was a rather large group of people chatting away who were set up at three of the four inside tables that had finished their meal 20 + minutes ago, ARGHGGHHG. That was not very considerate, considering the room full of people holding their trays of food fighting for a spot to eat. Finally, the fourth table cleared out and we were able to snatch it up.  I decided to sit on the same side of the booth as my wife, in case someone else wanted to sit on the other side; I guess no one was outgoing enough to randomly join, but at least I tried. We ate our food, with a bit of small talk, wiped our table and went on our way. There were still 6 or so people aimlessly wandering around for a seat, and the moment we stood up someone else grabbed the booth; all the while the one large group was still chatting away, drinking their soda's, taking up three tables.  I'm not sure how off putting something like this would be to diners, but I'd suggest trying out some friendly, non-threatening signage asking something like \"please consider diners waiting to enjoy this spot too\" to be put out during peak times; like lunch on a Thursday, and put away during other times. We enjoyed the food, enjoyed the service, but didn't enjoy getting cramped up into the little box of a dining room on a lunch break. I'm guessing this is a much better drive through spot than dine in.  Happy Yelping Phoenix! Please, drive on through for your order. :-)",

When you are paying $13 for a burger and fries - and have to sit outside in Phoenix to eat it, you expect everything to be very good.  Today I put in my order and as I was paying I asked for the wifi password.  The young woman at the register said they didn't have wifi.  Well, they do, and right behind her shoulder was a Nest Thermostat - which only works off of wifi.  I pointed this out to her and she said nobody knows the password.  Ok, fine.  You don't want to provide a free thing to your customers I guess that is your prerogative.  I ordered my burger without tomato.  I said it twice to make sure she got that.  Normal wait time, she delivers my burger and fries.  The fries were 300 degrees and had about a quart of excess oil on them.  The burger...  of course it had tomatoes on it.  Then, when I take my first big bite of burger the other woman comes right to my table as I bite down and stands there asking me questions about how my meal was.  Seriously?  She stands there chuckling as I have to chew with her staring at me.  This made everything taste like garbage.  That is THE worst move in a restaurant and for that I'll never return to this one.  I'm still seething that she had to RUIN the meal that I paid and tipped well for.  I was about the 15th customer of the day, and my $2 in the jar were the only $2 in the jar.  A few blocks east on the south side of the street is the Chicago Hamburger company.  Go there.  They don't try and hijack your meal there and have enough seating inside for their customers.",

We wanted the short rib, but they were all out. The stand sauce is pretty great too. Only thing is I wish they had a different bun for the burger. Next time I would like to try the shakes.",

They consistently forget to give me napkins on drive thru orders & have mixed up 2 beef 1 chicken for the opposite.  Nonetheless, Short rib tacos are amazing.  4 stars as service (no napkins and incorrect orders) needs improvement.",

I called and told the owner about the issues and he didn't seem to care.  I go back every once and awhile to see if it's getting better but I just keep getting different tasting tacos with hard stale tortillas and they don't even give you a lime with the tacos anymore.  I'll give them 3 stars because the burgers are still really good.  Chocolate shake is usually good but sometimes has some freezer burn.",

It seemed so unassuming and I never had even considered stopping before- now I'm so glad that I have! The first time through I got The Standard, no cheese, no alterations and a side of fries. I don't know if it was hunger but I swore that was the best burger and fries I've had in ages. The fries were super hot, crispy and seasoned in the yummiest mixture of spices. SO GOOD. I was craving it again and went through, this time around noon but my experience wasn't as great. I added jalapenos and grilled onions to The Standard, ordered the fries and a side of stand sauce. This time it cost me around $10 total because of all of the additions and I don't think it was really worth it. The fries were a little soggy and not as generously seasoned as the previous time and the burger was a little greasier and messier to eat. The stand sauce cost extra and it wasn't anything to die for, though it was good. Next time I'll stick to the regular and hope for crispier fries...and get a shake I've been hearing raves about!",

Their French fries are magnificent... And they make them in house of course :) if you're lucky and the heavens are Smiling down on you... you'll find a potato end that is fried up like a golden nugget in the mix. You can't help but smile while you eat!  The staff is so incredibly cheerful and pleasant... Making sure everything is clean and orderly around the small restaurant.  Even when it was busy, the staff seamlessly acknowledged every guest walking in and out, without skipping a beat for the existing patrons.  The patio is adorable and intimate. Bike racks in front for the neighborhood peeps like us, but a decent size parking lot out back for the rest. No fear if your in a hurry... They have drive thru !  Such a wonderful find in the neighborhood ! GO! RUN! EAT AT THE STAND !!!!  #yourewelcome",

    "text": "As always, skip to the last paragraph if you want the quick review!  I've driven by this joint on the north side of Indian School Rd. more than once and today I had an opportunity to stop and check it out.  I was getting it to go, but went inside to see what the place was like, rather than use the drive thru window. It is small, but what would you expect from a place called \"The Stand\".  I found it very clean and busy.  It was 12:30PM on a Monday.  There were three people ahead of me in line and a couple of people taking orders.  They moved us through pretty quickly. I ordered a burger w/cheese, a short rib taco, vege taco and a chocolate shake.  This will end up being two meals for me, but I always like to try a few different things when I go someplace for the first time. She asked if I wanted fries, I declined, she countered with \"It's free fries Monday\".  OK, I'll try the fries as well. My order was ready in about 10 minutes. The staff were friendly and you definitely got the feeling they were working hard to get things out as quickly as possible. Despite the small menu, they have some good offerings for the masses. I feel their pricing is fair.  The ingredients seemed to be of better than average quality, so I expect to pay a little more than average.  How does it go, do a few things and do them well.  Holds True at The Stand as far as I'm concerned.  The burger was reminiscent of old school In and Out, back when they were just in California, but just a touch better.  The shake was delicious, although could have been a touch smoother.  Fries were good as well.  If you like crispy fries, you'll probably want to request that when you order.  Vege taco was delicious.  Very well done.  Short rib taco was tasty too.  Will I go back? Yes, if I'm in the area and want a quick and tasty lunch!",

Its not that I wont eat a burger like the ones here because obviously they are good.  But getting burgers that are smashed and thin and such is just depressing to me. Its like going to an upscale mcdonalds. I am all about deals and here for the price you pay I would rather go down the street to grab a full size burger medium rare with a over easy egg on top. Now thats my cup of tea per se.  My boyfriend loves this place and i enjoy it as well. Its just not on the top of my list at first to go to... its more of like oh...okay. sure...whatever.

    "text": "I was born in this neighborhood, so I was curious to see who the next \"victim\" would be at this notoriously cursed location. I saw \"burgers and tacos\" and I was interested, I appreciate a simple menu. Place looks great, all modern tables and chairs and everything else. I will keep this review simple:  Pros:  Burgers were awesome, it's really hard to find a good burger in this town without going to a sit down restaurant. Taco was awesome! Shakes look amazing, interesting flavors, Dulce De Leche / Banana Chocolate and so on. Didnt try the fries but looked like you got a  good amount of them for the money.  Cons: \"Hecho En Arcadia\" ??? The staff had this stupid phrase all over their shirts and it was painted on the outside of the building. You arent from here, you moved here from out of state, like everyone else who lives in \"Arcadia\"   OVERPRICED BOTTLED COKE! $2.49???? This is straight up hipster tax. You can buy these glass bottle mexican cokes at circle K for 99 cents all day, but if you go to one of these new hipster \"dive\" restaurants, they try and play it off like it's some rare treat to have a bottled coke and want to charge you a premium to experience this delicacy.   Over attentive staff. This seems like it would be in the \"pros\" category, but you go out to eat to sample the food and chat with your friends. It was really hard to talk with my friend and enjoy our meals when there is someone reaching in front of your face every five seconds grabbing at your straw wrapper and tray. I literally just finished my taco when a kid comes up and tries to grab the tray from under my nose. Chill out dude, I've still got a lime and hot sauce on there that I might want to play with. I actually had to tell him I was going to keep the tray with me, which led to a quizzical look from him. So I was sucking on my lime, talking with my friend, and another staff member comes up and just snatches my tray from under me without asking! Pretty annoying.  Overall, food is good, if a little pricey ( $6 for a burger $3 for fries $2.50 for a coke. That's kind of a lot for a burger joint. ) Place is nice and clean but a little douchey, trying to bring some Scottsdale pseudo-diveyness to my neighborhood.",

Hearty & spicy with quinoa, black beans and tons of flavor. My boyfriend tried the braised short rib taco and he loved it. It was very savory and packed with meat. I'm sure we will be back to satisfy those late night munchies. Oh, and the drive-thru only took 5 mins. Not bad.",

The burger comes with two patties with cheese and you can add caramelized onions, roasted jalapenos, and bacon. It does suck how all the good toppings are extra but it's worth it. The fries are hit and miss. When they are crispy they are delicious. Especially when you dunk them into their Stand sauce. However, they have been soggy a few times. Lastly, their shakes are some of the best I've ever had. The best one is the dulce de leche but the banana one is amazing as well. They have cool drinks like horchata and homemade lemonades. I would definitely recommend checking this place out. It's a little on the pricey side but for the quality of the food I think it's totally worth it.",

However, I'm only giving them three stars because of the fact that they no longer serve tacos at this location. I was a big fan of their tacos so I was disappointed to find that they are no longer available. Apparently they have decided to sell burgers on Indian School and tacos at their new location at Scottsdale and Shea. What, why don't you sell both items at both locations? They're both good, but neither one requires specialty equipment.  That being said, if you want a burger go here, but just don't expect to get tacos.",

My friend Jason was just there raving about it, and I remember John Jay from John Jay and Rich coming here almost every other day so I knew I had to give it a try. I was not disappointed. Its pretty simple. Order your meat, add cheese, add toppings, add fries and a shake or soda if you would like. There are few options and that means they can focus on quality. I added bacon and roasted jalapeno peppers.  Be warned my friends... these jalapeno's were NO JOKE! I pulled a few off because I was starting to sweat. The meat itself was delicious and juicy, the cheese was ooy-gooy and plenty, the bacon was thick, and the fries were crispy. My -1 star was for all around service. So bad. I think they were stoned out of their minds and it was slow so at least they weren't busy but I cant tell you how uncomfortable I felt and how many times I had to slowly repeat myself. No smile, no common courtesies, no direction. They had one of their friends sitting in a corner who they were paying far more attention to even as they took our order. It was just an odd experience. Made me regret not taking the drive through. I am also sad I didn't get the chance to try the tacos before they pulled them from the menu but oh well that burger was great!",

    "text": "You would think it would be hard to screw up a simple burger. Especially when the burger is exactly half of the menu offerings. Well, The Stand did not screw up my burger today, but the service left a bad taste in my mouth.  Apparently, trendy burger joints can only offer a cool atmosphere and great food, but don't know how to run a restaurant. I was actually excited to finally visit The Stand for lunch today because I had heard about it and read up some more on Yelp! I don't recall anyone complaining about the service.  When our group arrived, the line filled the small lobby and snaked back to the door. There were plenty of employees busy in the kitchen working hard to keep up with the counter and drive-thru. I wasn't surprised that The Stand was so busy. I was surprised that the poor girl on the register was the only one taking orders. And she had to expedite the orders to the dining room and patio. And she had to bus the dining room and patio. This all happened with about ten or more people standing in line.  It doesn't matter how good the food may or may not be. It also doesn't matter how quickly the food came out after it was ordered. If your popular little restaurant isn't staffed properly at lunch time to get people in and out (pun possibly intended) in an hour, you ain't gonna be around long.  For the record, the simple options on the menu are tantalizing, the drink options are impressive, the burger and fries were delicious, and the guys in the kitchen deserve a raise for saving the day! As it is, The Stand is on the edge of the lunch hour drive time boundary. It's doubtful I will be back mid-day anytime soon.",

The fries were awful - barley warm, I got the impression they were left over - definitely not a fresh batch. If they would have been fresh, they may have been good. We also ordered two shakes- one chocolate, one vanilla. Again, the shakes were good - nothing incredibly special, but good yet overpriced. Can't say we will return as there are too many equally as good burger joints that are not so expensive.",

The stand having a drive thru, and the double patty with cheese burger costing only 5.99(do yourself the favor and add the caramelized onion) makes this drive thru burger a tremendous and  delicious value.   The stand instantly goes to the top of my favorite drive thru burgers list.   Living in the Arcadia lite neighborhood I've had the stand in the past, back when they used to serve short rib tacos, but since recently returning, it looks like the stand has narrowed their menu down to what they do great.. burgers and shakes!   I will be returning soon and often.",

The burgers, fries and the drinks are intensely flavored. I was shocked at how every bite defined a flavorful meaning where after the meal I was convinced that I had to try the milkshake (something I never do) and let me tell you, it was just as awesome as the rest of the food.  Nice and roomy outdoor seating and right next door to an AMC movie theater makes it a real convenient experience - a one stop shop date!  I took out a star for the pricing, I know it's a great location and the upkeep must be high but the portions do not justify the pricing - enough to make me bring it up, it's a $12 burger in a \"burger joint\".  Either then that they have some nice little hidden items from Mexico like real cane sugar mexican cola in a glass bottle, sign me up!",

    "text": "I hate to do this cause I really wanted to like the Stand, and I'm probably going to be one of the few to say, it was just okay.  Street tacos - $2.99 each. We got the short rib tacos and they were tasty (or too sweet, my hubby says) but soo tiny. I'd like more but for $2.99 a piece, not so much. If it were $0.50-$1 cheaper, I'd be all over it, but not for $2.99, sorry.  The Standard is their burger which is a double patty burger with the usual onions, lettuce, and tomatoes for $5.49. For $0.50, you can add cheese. For $1.59, bacon, and for $0.79, caramelized onions. Again, for that price, I'm really hesitant to add everything on it but it'd be so plain otherwise. So fine, take my money. This better be good. But it was okay. Too much bread for me, with just a little bit of bacon - which didn't appear to be thick cut bacon as the menu stated, and a lot of vegetable.  Price aside, it bugged me some that the food wasn't piping hot. Like some ingredients were somewhat hot but when most of the other items are at room temperature, it kinda takes away from the piping hot meal I was hoping for.  I'd still say give it a go since there were tons of people going for take out, but I guess my expectations were a little high so don't make that mistake.",

    "text": "Burgers and tacos. It's not rocket science. I can make both of those at home and come out with pretty good results because I choose all the ingredients. Fresh ground beef for the burgers and nicely seasoned shredded chicken for the tacos. This is the reason I don't buy burgers from a restaurant if I am eating them at my home. But what if I have a hankering for a tasty burger while at work? The Stand is the correct answer.  So it's another burger joint, but with some tacos, right? Sort of. It's small and cozy with some indoor and some covered outdoor seating. The staff are cheery and helpful. The menu is simple and easy to order from. I typically go with The Standard with cheese and fries with a side of Stand Sauce. The Stand Sauce isn't a terribly complex sauce but that is sort of the beauty of it. It compliments the fries perfectly.  The burgers and fries come out hot and very fresh. You can tell the quality of the meat in the burger from the first bite. The fries are equally telling of the quality. A little bit of Stand Sauce with the fries and you have yourself a home run of a burger lunch. It is a hearty burger but not too large as to create a coma once you are back at your desk. The serving of fries is equally portioned just right.   I hope you have read this far because this is the important stuff right here. Get the lemonade. Don't hesitate. It is strong but balanced. I have had the peach and strawberry which both were extremely tasty. I had to water them down a little bit but I like that they serve it with a good strong profile so that you can water it down if you like because the other way around simply wouldn't work. I believe there is a daily rotation on which type of lemonade they are serving. I have never been let down by it.  This is Phoenix so I recommend getting there as close to or a little before 1100 so that you don't have to sit outside in the summer. In the winter the outdoor seating is wonderful, however. It also helps quite a bit to be toward the front of the line so I can get back to my desk in time with a little lemonade to spare.",

Essentially, the only thing left on the menu is burger and fries.  And that wasn't very impressive.  The fries were soggy and tiny, like they collected all the little scraps of fries from the bottom of the bag, cooked them until they were just limp enough, then tossed them in our bag.  Stand Sauce?  What is that?  The Stand burger was just okay.  Honestly, for the price, InAndOut is far superior in both burger and fries.  I know.  The Stand in Arcadia once stood tall, and business was booming.  So much so they opened another location in Scottsdale.  I guess that is where all the attention goes now.  Buh-bye, The Stand.  It was nice while you lasted.",

The place itself is quite small, it's a order at the register and pick up your own food type of deal, unless they aren't busy they will bring the food to you. We got the standard burger with grilled onions. The burger was quite tasty, the standard actually comes with two patties, cheese and the regular fixings. We also ordered the fries to share. I was disappointed as the fries tasted like they had given us leftover fries from a few hours ago. They were cold, soggy, and some were super crunchy. The girl working at the register wasn't friendly either, she didn't like to answer the questions we had since it was our first time. Overall this experience wasn't outstanding.",

I would give the service ZERO stars if I could. We waited in line for 35 minutes and right after my friend placed her order to go the girl said \"I'll be right back.\" I tried to explain to her that we were together and could she just please take my order so our food would be ready at the save time. She ignored me. Another employee, a short female with glasses and a headset told her to deliver food to the dining room. While I stood there and waited to place my order the employee proceeded to dry trays and stare at me... even  though I tried to explain that we were together she would not take my order. Needless to say my friend's food was ready before I even placed my order. Then when my order was ready it was placed on a tray and walked to the dining room when they called my name. Both employees knew my order was to go and that I was with my friend. I feel like they were intentionally passive aggressive with my order because I tried to explain that it didn't make sense to take a pause in orders between two customers who are together. Common sense! My friend's food was cold. The fries were over cooked and dried out in the center. My burger was very dry.  Total shame because I work in a large medical office that gets lunch out a few times a week. This place is literally around the corner. I wanted to like it!! Instead I say... keep driving... go to Smashburger instead!!!",

On to my absolute favorite part of The Stand experience...their milkshakes. Oh. My. Goodness. The Banana Stand and the Salted Dulce de Leche milkshakes are to die for!!! They are SO creamy and honestly the best milkshakes I've ever had the pleasure of sucking down. Once you start, you won't put it down until it gone.   Their staff is very friendly and the owner has been on site every time I have visited. He has made my boyfriend and mines visit feel extra welcome. I can't wait to go back!

Well, I'll be back for THAT combo, as this will be a regular burger joint for this ex-in-n-out lover...adios to the drab and welcome, my new romance! Hey really, this is a simple double burger with just the right bacon, grilled jalopeneos and carmalized onions and the typical tomato and lettuce accoutrements. Had to try the hand-cut fries, of course, which made a great pairing; crunchy and flavorful, just how I like 'em. Was it typical? I'll find out soon enough.  Service was spot on, as I \"dined in\" outside, and the meal was brought to my table with a smile, and afterwards an offer for a free refill on the soda. Simple, Satisfying and Smooth!",

Now the burger is the only thing I've tried here so its all I can speak to. Its two freshly grilled patties (I order mine with cheese which was melted into the patty just right), set atop your ordinary bun with cool veggies and a sauce that gives it a juicyness, yummm! Its messy but so good. Only bad thing is I live around the corner! I see lots of cheeseburgers in my future.",

I drive up to the window and I get no salutation and don't even get noticed for almost 10 minutes. There were no other cars in line. And it was just after 12pm. Finally get my order.  Tacos not too bad. They're suppose to come with salsa, neither one of my tacos had any salsa. I also ordered chips and salsa on the side, the tiny containers are ridiculous. These containers are the kind you see at other places where you pack salsa to go. In my opinion, the salsa was not enough. The chips are tasty but a little hard to chew. First few were nice and crunchy, then they started getting dull and greasy.  I like supporting local businesses, but not sure I'll return. Good luck.",

He ordered the burger w/fries and I got two chicken tacos w/fries and a small  ice tea. Our total bill was a pricey $18.79.  Although well staffed, it took 10+ minutes to get our food.   The burger consisted of two thin \"in-n-out\" style patties that were pink in the middle and a side of under-cooked fries. Yuk!  The chicken tacos were the small \"street\" tacos, which that had a couple pickled onions, cilantro, and cheese on top. The chicken was over cooked and chewy. The tacos themselves were over priced for the portion size ($2.49 EACH)  Overall, the owners of the Stand have done a great job at fixing-up a dumpy looking building in this east Phoenix neighborhood. However, it's the FOOD that keeps a place like this in business and they are following in the footsteps of the doomed businesses that have gone before them in this particular location (Maui Dog and Rick's Philly). So if you are hungry and in the neighborhood, I would advise you to keep on driving...",

    "text": "The burger was really good but I must say because of it's location and fact it has such limited parking and gets so crowded it makes it really inconvenient. We got there right around 11:30am knowing the lunch rush would come shortly and I'm glad we did. A line formed minutes after we sat down and it got packed, the Dining room is small but they have some outdoor seating in the patio. The burger was delicious juicy and well seasoned with fresh toppings, gooey cheese and their special stand sauce which is basically like a 1000 island type sauce was very very good. I scarf my burger down in minutes! The fries were really good and looked fresh cut and seasoned with both salt and pepper which you don't see often, that was a plus! My husband also ordered a short rib taco, very good the beef was super tender and the toppings and salsa were very fresh. The banana stand shake was bomb with fresh bananas and banana pudding mixed in and the salted caramel shake was delish also. Bummer on those were they didn't come until we were almost done eating, guess a large order for shakes came in at the same time. I slightly compare the burger to in n out although they use fancier lettuce and their sauce is a little different. I did enjoy this place and the staff and service were great I'm  Glad I got to try it but the annoyance of it's location, limited parking and fact the cars using the drive thru basically blocks your ability to exit most likely will prevent me from returning, besides I don't live close and there is also no bathroom! I had to scarf down my food so I could hurry to find a bathroom elsewhere but not the end of the world. Definitely worth trying but be patient and know it's a small place and gets packed, I suppose that does show you they have quite a fan base.",

The building is small, but cute and clean with a few seats inside and a handful outside in a covered patio area.  I ordered The Stand burger with cheese and Niman Ranch bacon and shared fries and chips and guacamole with family.  The burger was one of the best I've had in a long time; great flavor, good sauce and fresh tomatoes, onions, lettuce and pickles.  The fresh cut fries were also excellent, not too crisp but not soggy.  The chips and guac were also great, it will be a tough decision next time which side to order.  I highly recommend The Stand and will definitely be going back!",

    "text": "I think my expectations of the food were set too high. Don't get me wrong, the burger was pretty damn good. Got it with everything: cheese, grilled onions, bacon & jalepenos. The last two are what made it great. Thick bacon & roasted, peeled jalapeno that was actually HOT (not for noobs). Fries were ok. The choco-chile shake was, well, a chocolate shake with powdered chile in it. I guess an extra dollars worth. It was good but no help against the jalepeno. Luckily the waitress(?) was nice enough to refill my soda many times. Did I mention the service? Very good, especially for a counter type setup. She even exchanged my hot salsa for mild after I tasted cumin in it (oh how I hate cumin, it kills the flavor of everything it touches). The mild was excellent, tomatoes, cilantro & chunks of garlic. If they put the jalapenos in it it would make a stellar hot salsa. As for the short rib taco, disappointing. The meat was ok. No better than a barbacoa taco anywhere else. The pickled cabbage is a little off making the taco taste, as my daughter put it, \"like taking a bite of cologne\". And the dry, store bought tortilla crumbled making a mess. For $3 a taco it should be fresh-made. All in all it was \"ok\". I'd come back for the burger or maybe the fresh squeezed lemonade but that's it.",

    "text": "Summary:  Clearly, The Stand is competing against In-N-Out.  For a few bucks more, The Stand gives you a significantly higher level of product from a slightly broader menu, and sold by a local business.  It reigns supreme in the hybrid restaurant category somewhere between In-N-Out and Delux.  Round 1:  The standard ($5.50) vs. the double-double ($4ish).  NOTE:  All prices are from memory since neither website publishes prices.  Although the burgers share a physical appearance (two cheesy patties, wrapped in paper, fun/sloppy presentation), The Standard burger feels, looks and tastes less like a chain burger and more like something that someone made just for me.   Big plus.  Except for the bun, every ingredient is superior to In-N-Out.  Thicker burger with more beefy flavor due to their meat mix, crisper thicker, fresher lettuce, excellent amount of sauce (I find INO to be too saucy in order to cover for the more bland burger), fresh onions (INO uses stale onions that give you stank breath-- hence people's preference for the \"grilled\" onions).   The only drawback is The Standard's spongy firm bun, which helps with holding the sandwich together but lacks the texture and flavor that a pillowy soft potato bun gives INO burgers.  Verdict:  The Standard.  Not really close.  Round 2:  Stand fries ($3) vs. INO fries ($2ish)  Fries has always been INO's biggest weakness. They are slim, hot, and often crisp, but they have absolutely zero flavor and usually come without any salt on them.  I HATE having to add salt to my fries.  Dumb salt packets.  The Stand's fries rock, some of the best I've had at a burger joint, even better than Delux when considering they cost $2 less.  A good sized portion comes fairly crisp, and best of all, they are very well-seasoned.   Verdict:  Stand fries, in the blink of an eye.  Round 3:  The Stand's chocolate banana shake ($4.50) vs. INO's chocolate shake ($2.50).  I think INO gets way too much credit for its shakes.  They're too thick to pull through a straw, and they are just pure soft serve.  The Stand takes actual ice cream, actual milk and, for the banana shake, actual banana and banana extract, to make their shakes.  The difference is obvious from the first sip.   Plus, The Stand has more than the boring vanilla, chocolate, strawberry options.  Verdict:  You had me at chocolate banana.  For the record, the tacos at the Stand could use some work.  I like the idea of tacos as a burger alternative, and the tacos are large, made with fresh ingredients including pickled onions (more of those, please) and above par tortillas.  But the chicken and short ribs didn't have a lot of seasoning-- they just relied on the taste of the well prepared but under seasoned meat.  If I wanted to \"honor\" the ingredient, I'd go somewhere fancy.  For a taco, give me some kick.  No kick found, not even in the spicy salsa.  My service was excellent (I got comped an order of fries just 'cuz).  The store was very clean and was well remodeled.  The inside seating didn't seem like it would work for a highchair, but the patio probably would.  The drive thru is a nice idea, but only if you called ahead and no one was in front of you.  My order took 6 minutes from when I placed it at the counter.",

    "text": "The Stand is simply incredible. As others have mentioned, it's much better than it looks from the outside.  As for food, their burgers are top notch quality--they're nearly every bit as good as you could get from a restaurant like Red Robin or Delux for half the price. In fact, the hamburger patty itself is more moist and delicious than those from most pricier places. I've never tried their shakes, but I've heard nothing but good reviews from others. Their peach lemonade (seasonal) was incredible and perfectly balanced, and their short rib tacos were superb (they were better than the short rib tacos from Chelsea's Kitchen). The only thing I'm not a fan of is their fries. They're very similar to In-N-Out's fries in cut, and they're probably just below In-N-Out's fry quality (which I don't care for to begin with).  The only other significant negative I can think of is their bathrooms. They're just outside the restaurant, and they aren't air conditioned.  Overall, I can't imagine giving The Stand less than five stars. The pros so dominantly outweigh the cons that the cons seem almost insignificant. If you're debating whether you should go there--go. If you're not considering going there--start considering...then go.",

    "text": "\"Okay\" is the appropriate way to describe this place.  The difference between two and three stars seems a bit extreme, as it wasn't bad by any means, but it certainly doesn't have me excited to go back anytime soon.  I feel comfortable giving it three stars because the service was excellent; the staff was super friendly, helpful, and very welcoming.  I also think they did a nice job with what they had to work with in the existing building.  It's simple but comfortable, and a good environment for their type of product.  Where the Stand falls short though is where it's most important, the food!  I had a couple of short rib tacos, the lady had the veggie tacos, and we ordered a side of fries, chips and salsa, and a dulce de leche shake (we wanted to make sure we got a good variety to try, I guess...)  The ingredients definitely seemed to be of quality and fresh, just like they advertise, but nothing was really that 'great'.  Short ribs are typically very juicy, tender, and succulent, these tacos were almost on the dry side.  The veg tacos had a good mix of veggies in them, but again did not really serve up anything that would make us regulars.  I guess I might be less critical on the taste and finished product if it weren't so expensive.  The tacos weren't cheap, and either were the fries.  The fries were good, comparable to the regular fries at five guys in taste and price, but think about 1/8 less quantity than you would get in the lunch bag portion at 5 guys.  The dulche de leche shake was good, plain and simple - it didn't disappoint, but I'm not craving to have it anytime soon either.    I really wanted this place to be good, as it's a few blocks from my house, but the product at the price point just doesn't deliver, and one or the other has to give.  The shake and the fries were good, but nothing I couldn't get over at zinburger or many other spots in the area.  Granted, I did not have the burger on this go round, and the place is still very new, I just didn't feel like I was getting my money's worth.  Either the food would have to be significantly better to get me to pay sit-down taco prices (overhead of a sit-down Mexican restaurant aside) or the prices would have to come down to get me to feel like that quality of food was 'worth' it.  Maybe it's a case of this business not really finding its identity.  They seem to be trying to serve higher than drive-thru quality food at higher than drive-thru quality prices while still trying to maintain their 'drive-thru 2.0' type image.    I guess given the many good food choices in the arcadia/biltmore area, this one just didn't have anything to set itself apart and get me to go there instead of any of my other options.",

I find it hard to believe they would prefer to get burned on a $50 order vs a $6 order....just doesn't make sense.

    "text": "The drive-thru was ridiculously slow for a weekday night. No reason why it should have taken that long. In-N-Out has faster service. So don't go unless you are willing to wait.  We asked for a side of Stand Sauce and didn't receive it, so we had to turn around and get it. 50 cents for the equivalent of a ketchup packet... no thanks. It's ripped off spread, anyway.  The burgers were okay, but they kind of crumbled while we ate them. The fries were tasteless, greasy, and undercooked. I liked my gluten-free bun and jalapenos, but they weren't worth the additional charge.  I'm not sure why this place is so popular. The Stand is obviously trying to reinvent the wheel, and mostly fails miserably. Just go to In-N-Out, where you know you'll get good service, a correct order, and good food.",

The quality of the burger was great and the service was good overall. It would be nice if they offered a kids burger, kinda hard to pay full price for a kids burger that only has ketchup and a patty on it. Overall I recommend this place but maybe only for nights without the kiddos.",

The tacos are good but have too much of something, I think vinegar on the purple adds. The fries .. they're fries. Potato. Not amazing, but, legit. The best part of my meal, and I've been here two or three times, is the banana shake. Delicious.  But I have to take a star away from what would have been a four star experience because this place is too expensive. If you get a loaded burger, fries, a taco, a tiny little tub of their sauce, and a shake, expect to pay well over $20. Yikes! And I thought Carl's Jr. was bad on the price. My meal was good but worth maybe a little bit over half of what I pay at The Stand.",

The new owners did a great job of working with what they had to make the building inviting (paint, planters, etc) to customers to get over the stigmatism of a dive joint.    The burgers and tacos are premium grade!  One of the best burgers in central phoenix.  The fries are also good.  One of my favorites is the Salted Malts.  It will set you back nearly $5, but it's worth it.  One added perk, they serve their malts with a wide straw!  Few things are more frustrating that having to suck a malt thru a narrow soda straw.  I shouldn't have to turn red in the face just to enjoy a malt.     Most of the seating is outside.  It's shaded, but I'm guessing that it will be less desirable during Arizona's summer's months.  The service is also very good.  They do have modern kiosk cash register systems that are quick and convenient.  Definelty a must try if you're a Arcadia/Central Phoenix local.",

    "text": "It was a Saturday afternoon, there was a line. You can't always depend on a line to be a barometer for a place. Today, no shakes because of machine not working. I told a customer who was waiting in line that this is why you always keep a backup plan, even if it is a wooden spoon and someone has to make them by hand. I could not get a receipt either because they ran out of paper. Burger is supposed to be grounded  on premises so the sign says. Customers commented that it is a In-an-Out knockoff while I was in line, which is not a bad thing. But their attempt is novice. The burgers, people like them but they are not fantastic, especially if I have to wait for over 30 minutes and it cost me$6.00. What is happening to our restaurants in America. People seem to think that if they get a reward or something called the, \"best of\" that they can just do what they want for the sake of making money! You folks can eat here but there is nothing special about this place except that maybe they have enough people in the neighborhood to support them! The best burgers start with quality beef grinder on the premise, then cooked on a wood smoked grill and everything is made in house, or locally sourced organically. Sorry but buns, ketchup, mustard, pickles,fries and other accoutrements can be done in house!Then you deserve to-ask $6.00 for a burger. But overall, support them because they are doing the best they can. I think there were some events nearby and that's why they were so busy.",

Second, it takes way too long to actually order and receive your food. And last but not least, I was last the person to put an order in before they ran out of burger patties. How do you run out of the only thing you make? Literally their menu consists of The Standard Burger and fries. There were about 8 people behind me who left. The only reason I gave it 3 stars and not 2 was because their fries were fresh and crispy. The burger... ehhh it's like a glorified Five Guys burger.",

The fries are equally as good. The shakes are out of this world. We had the chocolate chile, banana stand and salted dulce de leche. It is extremely filling but well worth going into a food coma.",

    "text": "I enjoy a good burger, and this place delivers. When it comes to a good burger, I care less about price and focus on the crave. I must say, I have never been more satisfied eating a burger. This place is a must if you're wanting a tasty burger while in the Phoenix area. The menu is very simple, they offer your standard burger, fries, and a soda. Add some cheese and additional toppings for a few cents more per option. The total amount is about $10 per person for a full meal, which is totally reasonable compared to checking out a full size restaurant that tries to \"wow\" you with a good burger for $15 just for the entree, which fails miserably compared to a burger from here. This place is very small,  inside and out, so don't expect much of a fabulous atmosphere and dining experience. However, this place is charming and well kept. I would recommend calling in your order and arriving five minutes earlier if you plan to eat in their dining room or, taking out. Otherwise, their drive-through and take-out can get very busy at times too.   To those who have made mention or compared their burger to similar chain restaurants with the same concept; need I remind you of the difference between a good burger that surpasses the simplicity of you're average value burger chain.   Overall, if your palate is craving a good burger then you must check out \"The Stand\".",

    "text": "Before we left Phoenix we stopped at the stand. I had found a list on the top 25 burgers in the US and this one was on there. The pictures online showed a plain burger and thats what I like a burger that doesnt need too many toppings to taste good. We had just ate about 3 hours earlier at los reyes de la torta but I didnt want to pass up the chance to visit this burger spot on my bucket list. The location is small and not crowded at all.  From the picures on the wall this must be the original location they have some of the original items from when the stand was only a stand.  We tried all the drinks available and that was the peach lemonade, regular lemonade, and horchata.  The best one was the peach lemonade the horchata was not good at all.  The burger was great I kind of felt like shake stole there recipe from this place.  The reason I give this place 5 stars is the dulce de leche salted shake it is probably the best flavored shake I have ever had. I have had alot of shakes but I am always straight vanilla. The shake brough back memories of my trips to mexico were i would have candies with cajeta. Cajeta is very similar to caramel but a Mexican version of it.  I took the shake with me on the way home to California I kept thinking that the stand was the best place I ate at while on this trip to Arizona. We will be back at the stand for sure.",

Classic burgers are flavorful due to a proprietary blend of short rib and beef, while the shakes get modernized with a great salted dulce de leche flavor that will knock your socks off.

The only things old school about this place are the design and service- dig the roadside signage and genuinely nice cashiers.

    "text": "I was told by one of my customers \"This place is the S***.\" Well, I don't know about that but it was pretty decent. The customer service was great. The young lady greeted me right away, making me feel welcomed. I love the simple appearance of The Stand. very casual like you might expect from a little \"mom & pop\" place. The simplicity of the menu is great too. I've always felt restaurants need to go back to KISS, Keep It Simple St***d. The simplicity of the menu makes it easier to decide what I want and it doesn't congest the kitchen with a vast menu for the masses. That said...  I had the double cheese burger, an order of well done fries and a small Diet Coke. This was nearly $12. Sticker shock? You bet. Being totally honest, I thought about Red Robin for that price. However, the menu's description of the beefs quality cuts, no doubt played a huge roll in the price point. I felt like the burger was lacking flavor. At least salt the patties while they're cooking, but nope. The meat was very thin and cooked so well done, the meat had a crunch. I would have liked my fries to have a crunch, but no such luck. The portion size was great, winning over In-N-Out's fries. Again, no seasoning, but alas, there are salt shakers on the table. The fries are hand cut, similar to the aforementioned fast food establishment, but I ordered them \"Well Done.\" Well done as in crunchy. Nope! Not crunchy, limp and soggy. I could see it immediately when the young lady brought me my order. I asked \"Those are well done fries?\" to which she replied \"Uh-huh.\" Hmmmm.... Ok. I used to cook in restaurants when I was younger. These fries were cooked in oil that was too cold. I don't say this to bash The Stand, but merely offer a critique in deep fry 101. French fries love soaking in 360 degree oil. At best this fryer was set at 340. Notwithstanding, I will go back. I'm always a man of second chances. I am curious about their tacos. They looked amazing. This place gets four stars because I was mostly impressed with the service.",

We are excited to go back and try their tacos.  Everything is made to order, so food is super fresh.  The burgers are somewhere between In-N-Out and Five Guys-- it will be our new go-to fast food burger joint.  Fries are shoestring outta this world good.  Oh! And the staff is super friendly too!",

    "text": "Can I just say that The Stand is my FAVORITE burger place. Sorry to my Cali crew but The Stand wins out over In N Out, but just barely. That being said, this place just oozes the idea of a little neighborhood hamburger stand, Uber cool. I met my AOB boys here for lunch. Now as I said, this is a burger stand. I stress burger because they only have 1 burger on the menu, The Standard ($ 5.19). Great name for it as well. To be fair they do have a burger that's not on the menu but you'll have to ask the girls at the counter what the secret menu is (a la In N Out). The Standard is a TWIN house-ground ALL Beef patty masterpiece. It comes with what I would consider 'The Standard' burger toppings; lettuce, tomato, onion, & pickle plus they squirt on The Stand sauce as well. That's it. And for anyone that likes a humburger, that's ALL you need. Myself, I like Cheese on my burger and for ($ .50) you can add that as well. Aside from cheese, they offer some other add ons, which they call 'Stand-Ins' for you to make your burger, yours: Thick Cut Applewood Smoked Bacon from Niman Ranch ($1.59),  Butter Caramelized Onions ($.79), Fresh Grilled Jalapeno Peppers ($.79), and a Gluten Free Bun ($1.79). Go ahead and get your creative brain a flowin. If you're not in the mood for a burger, try the Taco's. Seriously. Other restaurants that sell Taco's should really come here and check out what this place accomplishes for the paltry sum they charge for some dang good Taco's. You can get your Taco 3 different ways although they all start with a nice corn tortilla; Short Rib ($2.99), braised short rib, pickled red cabbage, cotija queso fresco, diced onion & cilantro. Chicken ($2.79), roast chicken, pickled red onion, cotija queso fresco & cilantro. Vegetarian ($2.59), fresh seasonal vegetables, quinoa, black beans, pickled red cabbage & onions, and cilantro. The Stand also offers a few sides to compliment your burger masterpiece or Taco's; Hand Cut French Fries ($2.29), Mexican Street Corn ($2.59, only when in season), Tortilla Chips ($2.09), add Salsa for ($.70), & Chips & Guacamole ($3.79).  S & T ordered The Standard and I ordered The Standard with Cheese plus we all got the hand cut fries. No complaints from S & T but let me tell you that my burger was amazing. The twin patties were cooked & seasoned perfectly. They had a nice crust but were oohh so juicy. The bun was fresh as were all the toppings. I also added the caramelized onions which elevated this cheeseburger to a whole new level. And those who know onions know that they have to be slow cooked down with butter, not oil. OMG. Winner winner cheeseburger dinner. Our fries were crispy and delish. If you're concerned about the fries not being cooked enough ask for them crispy.  The Stand also offers Coke products & iced tea ($2.29/$2.79), bottled Coke from Mexico ($2.49), and some incredible fresh lemonade, flavored lemonade and Horchata made on site ($2.70/$3.29).  But the real deal meal enders are the hand-spun shakes ($3.99) for Vanilla or Chocolate or splurge for a specialty flavor ($4.49) like Salted Dulce De Leche, Chocolate Chile or Banana Stand. Yummy frozen goodness. Oh, and these bad boys are THICK. Note to drive-thru people: You'll need to give it a bit of time if you plan on trying to drink it through the oversized straw they give you. The Stand epitomizes EVERYTHING that is good about having taste buds. Great food, great prices, great employees, uber cool old school feel. 5 Stars.",

    "text": "We were in the mood for some burgers and fries for our Friday evening out but decided to try something different from our usual burger joints.  Location & Aesthetics - located on East Indian School Road in Phoenix.  The restaurant cannot be missed with its bright blue colored exterior, and large sign 'The Stand' (no relation to Stephen King's novel). There is a drive through option.    Parking was available on the side and rear of the restaurant but in my opinion not adequate for large crowds.  If dining in, the restaurant had minimal seating inside; there is some seating available under their covered patio which offered lots of privacy from the peering eyes of motorists from East Indian School Road.   For the minimal parking and dine-in seating (-1).  The outside seating was comfortable with music playing and a large dehumidifier to keep patrons cool (no misters).  I'm guessing it might be a bit difficult to eat out on the patio during the middle of the summer months.  Menus - clearly displayed over the cashier, simple, and easy to read.  They offer one burger with and without cheese; stand-ins which I didn't try; tacos and sides, and drinks. The offer a variety of drinks including horchata and a drink called a \"Jamaica\" which tastes like sorrel (a drink known in the Caribbean) but upon further research I discovered it's Hibiscus Iced Tea (hope I'm not wrong on that). Staff offered us samples of both to try.   Service - Staff was extremely friendly and greeted us immediately as we entered and asked if we were dining in and took our names.  They answered any questions we had about the menu and drinks.  Food - For me I ordered the Standard burger (2 House-Ground All Beef Patty, Crisp Leafed Lettuce, Fresh Tomato, Sliced Onion, Dill Pickle, and Stand Sauce) without the cheese, a chicken taco and a side of fries with the \"Jamaica\" drink. Despite the burger not oozing with juices and had a dry look to it, it was supremely tasty!  The burger itself was well seasoned and fresh along with the ingredients like the lettuce, tomato, onions (not overpowering), and the dill pickle.  I couldn't really tell whether the Stand sauce was in there or not but, if it was, it didn't deter from the taste of the burger.  The burger wasn't greasy, messy, or full of oils.   The fries was fresh cut, well seasoned with the right amount of salt and again wasn't oily or greasy. The chicken taco (Warm Corn Tortillas, Tender Roast Chicken, Pickled Red Onion, Cotija Queso Fresco, Fresh Cilantro) was also extremely tasty and my only regret was not ordering more, and even if I did, the wifesky would've put the kibosh on that one!  All of its ingredients were fresh, well seasoned, and served hot.  Even the tender roasted chicken tasted as if it was just made. The entire meal wen down easy and most importantly I didn't have that, \"I feel overly stuffed,\" feeling post-prandial.  Despite it being a little out of the way from where I live, I'd still very much love to visit here again as I thoroughly enjoyed the burgers, tacos, and the exotic 'Jamaica' drink!",

I mean what kind of burger is a burger with no cheese?? Kinda disappointing because the meat was dry and the bun tasted like the walmart buns. The horchata was good the rib taco was good too. The taco was good but holy he'll $3 something for one taco is pricey asf. I still like street taco and you get a more flavorful one for $1.25 each. The employee was really friendly and good service. Food was disappointing, it's hard to find a good burger joint. I think l.a and home Is the only place for me so far.",

Also carry Mexican Coke, which is better than regular Coke.  Handily better than burger chains like In and Out, McDs, BK, JIB.  Maybe on par with 5 guys, but being a local place, definitely gets bonus points.  Definitely will be back.  I want to try the lemonade.   Place was clean inside.  Service was friendly and prompt.  Arrived at just the right time, when it was empty.  As we finished, the afternoon rush started, and it was time to go.  Inside, is TINY.   Might be able to seat 15 people.  While there is outside seating, summer time is not the time to be outside.    If you go to get a burger there, I recommend get it to go or drive thru, unless it is empty and you can grab a seat.",

I was going to hit up Sip next door but was intrigued by the Stand and the words \"Burgers and Tacos\" painted on the side. Once I arrived, I realized that they aren't selling tacos or street corn. I ended up getting a standard burger (w/bacon and cheese) and fries along with horchata. All three were some of the best examples I've had in a long time. If you're ever in the mood for a burger, this place is amazing. I added jalapeno to my burger because I'm a sucker for hot peppers and I was stoked to see that they were diced fresh jalapenos. It was fantastic. Because I can taste the fine quality ingredients in everything I tried, I really wish they still had the Mexican food and would highly recommend they bring those items back, anyway they can.",

I ordered a veggie and a chicken taco, they came out quickly and tasted very fresh and flavorful. Unfortunately there was a big bone in my chicken taco. I hurt my tooth and tried to let a worker here know and I was shocked at her reaction. She looked at me, never apologized and acted annoyed that she did not apologize or even offer to fix the situation. I had even mentioned it to her. I probably won't be back based on the lack of customer service.",

I wasn't much of a fan of either taco but the fries were pretty good. I understand having a simple, small menu, but it goes without saying that then, the items on the menu have to be amazing. It would've been nice to see a grilled chicken option in the burger category.  As far as the service goes, however, they're really nice and efficient at moving through the line and getting orders out. I wish I liked the food more because it really is a great concept!",

Burgers are pretty good if you are a fan of the in-and-out style of burger. I do wish they had a single patty option, as the double stack is pretty big.   The short rib taco is better than the chicken, but I'm not the biggest fan of the pickled veggies on them. I just pick them off.  Fries and guacamole are great!  The chips are strange though. They use a different type of oil that I think is supposed to be healthier. Both times I've tried them all I can taste is that oil and it has a strong smell too. I always get take out and I can smell the chips in my kitchen for hours after they've been in there.  I have no real complaints. It is a good place if you are looking for a quick bite that's better than a traditional drive through. But be prepared to wait a little longer too. They make your food to order, so unless you want to spend a significant time in your car, I would skip the drive though if there is even a single car in line.",

I would compare them to McDonald fries. But natural. Better than a lot of burger shops. Then comes the taco..eww it was sweet. I couldn't for the life of me figure out where the sweet juice was coming from. It was nasty. It was a bad attempt at Mexican food. Or whatever Kind of twist they were trying to create. Then the tea incident. I was given no sweetners for my tea. This was a negative. The food was notably clean. I would return.",

They \"get\" great customer service and always ask for my name when I order even in the drive through.  I haven't had a chance to try a shake yet mostly because I save my calories for a Standard with Cheese and fries.  They are also always happy to modify my burger as I am not a lettuce, tomato, onion fan.  Only gripe is they use a lot of pepper on both the burger and on the fries.  I like well seasoned but the beef is amazing and flavorful so no need to add anything else.  Same with the fries, salt is all you need!",

You know it was good because after we devoured (literally) our burgers and fries, we stood back in line for a dulce de leche shake (after hearing someone else on the patio exclaim to his fellow diner - \"This is the best shake I have ever had!!!\" - so we knew we had to get one). It did not disappoint. They were even giving out samples of their banana shake, which was equally delicious. I am definitely going to be coming back because the service was attentive, the food came out quickly (despite the power apparently going out half an hour before we got there), and both the indoor & outdoor spaces were hip, cute & clean. In my opinion, the burgers here are better than In N Out or Five Guys. The Stand....I love you!",

My wife and daughter split a standard burger with cheese, I went for the standard with bacon and cheese and my little guy wanted a taco.  While trying to get him to decide which meat he would eat (he said he wanted cinnamon, not a helpful response.....) and figuring out what I would need to take off the women at the register mentioned kids options.  These include grilled cheese, quesadilla, kids burger and tacos where you choose your meat and toppings.  We chose ground beef and added cheese.  The boy was happy, we were happy.  Tried a couple of shakes and chips and salsa.  All really good.  Salsa a little different profile, but I liked it.  Also had fries which were perfect.  Patient with ordering and the split up the burger and shakes without issue.  Very accommodating and attentive service.  Only wish I of the kids options earlier, but know I know.",

The menu is pretty limited when it comes to their burger. They have \"The Standard\". But when you make something right, why deviate from it? I got mine with jalapenos and we ordered some fries.   It was busy, so the wait was a little longer than we expected but it was definitely worth it.   The burger and fries are so fresh, hot and good! If I could just make one minor suggestion, it would be to toast the bun on the grill a little bit. I  Needless to say, I felt like a huge fatty after I left. I'd definitely come back again.

The juicy flavorful patty between two fresh baked buns topped with FRESH ingredients will have you floored and satisfied. I cannot stress enough about how FRESH the ingredients are. Including the lettuce, tomato, onion, cheese, beef, buns, jalapeno, and even condiments. Each bite was so good. Very juicy. Perfectly seasoned. And again you can't help buy acknowledge the superior fresh ingredients. Their delicious fries pair nicely. They have homemade horchata which I didn't try. But I did try their carne asada tacos and I was impressed.   Overall a great little find. If your a burger connoisseur like myself, I recommend giving this place a visit. Order it to go and pair it with an Arrogant Bastard. If you add a little bit of a kick to the burger like Tapatio, or if you added jalapenos, Arrogant Bastard will definitely react nicely with the spicy tones and of course the after taste will mix nicely together with the seasonings. And because of the fresh ingredients you'll be able to go back and forth between beer and burger while enjoying the zesty fries.",

    "text": "I am officially a Stand junkie. It only took one time.  I found The Stand on Yelp a while back, and when we tried to go they were closed for a holiday party (nooooo!) so we had to ignore our burger cravings and go get hot wings (well, that actually wasn't so bad). Last night my boyfriend REALLY wanted a burger and insisted we go.  I had visited their website and figured there was no way the burger was going to look like it did on the website...I was wrong. But, I get ahead of myself. We walked in and ALL the staff were super nice. We ordered two Standards with cheese, drinks, and BF got fries (with their special sauce on the side). I totally forgot about their street corn and am cursing myself for not asking about it (but it's seasonal so maybe I'll have to wait anyway). BF got the grilled jalapenos on his burger, I didn't.  HOLY MOLY. They brought our burgers out and they were gone before I could even snap a picture. They DID look just as awesome as they did on their website. When does that ever happen? The beef cuts combination they use for the burger (short rib, chuck, brisket? I think that's right) makes it the best burger ever. The bun was awesome, the pickles were perfect (not the crappy kind you get in a jar, like most places throw on theirs). Overall, it's a super simple, not fancy burger that is perfection. The fries were a little crispy for my taste but the sauce that came with them was awesome.  The combination of the awesome food, super reasonable prices considering how great the food is, and beyond-nice staff means this will be one of our new go-to places.",

The shake was much better than most I have tried around town. The burger was fantastic! perfect ingredients and meat all served on a fresh bun (which might have been a Hawaiian bun).

It's soft, toasted really nicely and with all the delicious ingredients in between I almost forget it's even gluten free. I've gotta say I'm not crazy about the tacos but I crave these burgers constantly. It's a rare gem to find a drive through place with such high quality ingredients and really decent prices. I've never had any issues with customer service, everyone I've dealt with has been extremely pleasant. Any one who hates on their burgers is delusional.  If you're feeling naughty get the dulce de leche shake, it's ridiculously good.",

I thought the burger was great and priced very reasonably for an upper echelon fast food burger. I am picky about what toppings I like on burgers, so I was quite pleased that my order was correct.  I docked one star from this review because I thought the fries were disappointing. For one person, the serving size is too large and the cost is too high (this is the same problem that Five Guys has). The fries were mediocre tasting as well.",

You can't go wrong with their tacos or burger; both are solid (Chicken tacos are a personal favorite). Milk Shakes are quality too (especially salted caramel). In a perfect world, the Burger Kings and McDonalds out there would be replaced with establishments like this. Nothing crazy, just good solid food made well.   One huge plus side here too is that they are great for people who must eat Gluten Free. Pretty much everything on the menu is either already gluten free (all the tacos, fries, chips) or can be made that way (the burger). They even have gluten free hamburger buns, which I don't see at too many places.   I'd love to see this place be successful, because fast food that is actually GOOD is in short supply. It'd be great to see places like this start popping up more often.   (Sad side note...this used to be the building where Maui Dog was...hate to see that place go, thought it was great; but glad the building was taken over with something else good like this)",

I still think Five Guys is a great contender. The place just looks like a little wooden Shack. We arrived 30 minutes before they closed and the cars were wrapped around the Drive Thru. We just ordered The Stand Burger with Cheese which is your usual Lettuce,Tomatoe,Mayo,Onions on a Kaiser Roll. The Burgers were meaty and big, their French Fries were Shoestring and good. They sell Tacos and  Milkshakes too. They have a newer location with an extended menu. I might try them too.",

Not to mention I cannot enjoy a burger without a french fry and the fries at the stand are so overly crunchy and thin that it makes them non enjoyable for me. Plus the sauce tastes exactly like the sauce at Cane's and even that didn't help with the flavor of the fries.  However, the staff is super friendly and welcoming. Our order taker was awesome and helped make the experience nice. The food just isn't anything worth going back for.",

All in all, probably the best burger on this side of town.  I ended my meal with a vanilla shake-pretty good for a burger joint, but over priced at $5.  Perhaps the speciality flavors are, but not the basic chocolate or vanilla.  A special shout out to the water.  It's simple and free, but the water was some of the cleanest tasting I've ever had in a restaurant.  I asked and they told me it came from the fountain so I know they're cleaning the spigots well if the water was so good.  If you're around Indian School, hit The Stand.  You won't be disappointed.",

If you're coming here when it's busy it's better to park somewhere else and walk to it because the way the drive through is set up if it's backed up with cars it literally(I'm not exaggerating in the least) traps everyone else who parked in the parking lot, especially since they put a chain up so you can't just drive through the alley to a side street. Food is positive 5 stars and worth it every time hands down never had a bad burger or bad service here. Parking lot set up is negative 5 stars and just park in the parking lot next to it instead.",

So, with no plans for food last night and both of us having the night off, we looked up our bookmarks and hit this place up!  It's a smaller location with a tight parking lot that also has a drive-thru as a part of it.  When walking across the parking lot, be sure to pay attention to incoming cars since it can be a bit of a blind turn for them and you will be walking directly in the parking lot pull-in and drive-thru pull-in path.   Once you are safely inside the menu is short and to the point. You can get the classic burger with or without cheese and a variety of toppings. There are a couple of types of tacos and two or three options for side orders like fries or chips.  Finally, for drinks they have bottled sodas, bottled water or milkshakes!  We both had the classic with cheese since that seemed like the staple item on the menu and when we try a place the first go round we like to try what it is known for.  We each also ordered a side of fries.  I had a shake and she opted for a bottle of water.    The burger was really tasty and I had swapped the regular onions for grilled onions, and I preferred that way over her regular ones. The fries were definitely delicious, but a touch over salted for my taste - we could easily have split an order instead of getting one order each.  The stand sauce was a great addition to pretty much everything edible on the tray!  We'll be back and we'll be trying out those taco options!",

The burgers and fries are above par, and beat the average burger drive-thru by a lot more than a stone's throw.  I'm guaranteed to keep comin back to this nice little spot.",

Everything from their burgers, fries, tacos, shakes, etc. are very good.  Their overall service, however, is what always leaves a bad taste in my mouth. I have never been to a fast food joint with as slow of service as The Stand. Do not go, whether it's through the drive thru or the lobby, unless you have at least 20-30 minutes to spare. Even if you're the only one there you'll be waiting a good 15 minutes. I understand quality food takes longer than two minutes to make, but The Stand is outrageously long. Sometimes the food is worth the wait, but overall I wouldn't make it a place to frequent unless you're extremely patient.",

    "text": "Great place to grab a burger with the family or alone.  The Good:  Easy to find, good parking.  Inside is clean and cute.  Lots of staff there to help with anything you need.  It's one of those classic, limited menus that stood the test of time.    The food has a really nice presentation to it.  See my pic and others.  Everything looks fresh and the burger is carefully wrapped.  Lot's of attention to detail.  There is a SNAP when you bite through the fresh veggies.  The taco is a nice change, try it once.  A burger, taco, and large drink is $11 and change.  The bad:  Well, unfortunately, I just didn't like the taste of the burger that much.  It's not bad by any means, just not on my tops list.  The combination of spices just didn't hit me the right way, and I didn't get as much veggie taste as I would have liked.  The bun was dry, cracking up a little as I got more into the burger.  That being said, it's still a nice place.  Everyone else seems to like it so maybe it's just my palette.  Everything else about the place is good so I have no problem recommending it.",

Their double party burgers were to die for and cooked perfectly. They have a sort of sauteed onions (and I don't even like onions that much) that make it even better.   The fries and sauce need a paragraph of their own. The fries were cut small (my favorite) and not over done or too soggy. It was a mixture of both textures at the perfect level. The sauce could seriously be eaten by itself. But I just really like sauce, good sauce, mind you. It wasn't just mayo and ketchup, there were spices from another world.   Go here. The coke is huge too and comes in a glass bottle, and made with real cane sugar.",

The order was short rib taco, the Standard burger with cheese, and a Standard burger with cheese wrapped in lettuce.  After I signed my credit card receipt and they were getting my order ready, he opens the window and asks I would like a gluten-free bun, obviously noting the one that was wrapped in lettuce was most likely due to a gluten allergy.  He was absolutely correct.  They wrapped it in lettuce, as originally requested, and sent a gluten-free bun also.  Both observant and kind.  Come to find out, 99% of their menu is gluten-free so people with allergies or Celiac's will be happy to know that.  Thanks again The Stand-Eva, Ron, and staff.    Please go and support this place for my own selfishness of being able to keep going there myself!",

It must be a great place to work too, because there is surprisingly low turnover for a restaurant, and staff members always seem to be moving fast and enjoying themselves. The thing I like most about The Stand is, even though they got busy and popular right away, they have not become complacent. I'm there often enough to notice that they continue to fine tune their food and operations, tweaking cook times and chop-thicknesses and packaging materials ... settling for nothing less than perfection. In fact, I'm going to get myself a burger right now. And a shortrib taco. Jealous?",

As for the food, we had a cheeseburger, the pork taco, the chicken taco, fries, and chips with guac. The food was \"eh\". It's like a Honda Civic. Will it get you where you need to go? Yes. Are you rushing to the dealership to buy one after winning the lottery? Probably not. Good enough for lunch but probably won't come back for food. Just more heaven in a cup with a giant straw.   Staff was cool, ambiance was relaxed, patio was weird and cool. Check out The Stand for a milkshake.

I usually spend more than $10 for what is essentially a fast food meal. I tried the drive through once, which took about 45 minutes to get some of my food. The rest was acquired after they realized I was still there after they shut the window on me. It wasn't busy, maybe not a typical experience, but definitely unacceptable.   3 stars for good food. Missing the other 2 for bad service and a little overpriced.",

Mouth watering meaty burgers on a crispy toasty soft moist bunn. With  pickles. The street corn has a delicious variety of spices on a white ear. It came on a stick in a cup! Vintage building in a historic part of phoenix, awsome people. I highly recommend this place to anyone who enjoys in n out because the Stand is simply 10 better!

It was good, but nothing special for me. However, i later tried the tacos and that will now be my go-to. The chicken tacos were delicious, but the braised short-rib tacos blew me away! So juicy and flavorful.  But the stars of the show are the shakes. Shakes for days! The Banana Stand... Chocolate Chili... Salted Dulce de Freakin' Leche! No lie... I double fisted the first two today. I feel like a disgusting human being... But I can't wipe this smug, satisfied smile off my face. Time for a nap.",

The staff are all helpful and really friendly. Get the Stand Sauce too... My favorite meal is the double burger with fries. If you are in the mood for something else, the tacos are so flavorful you won't be disappointed. They are soft and the meat is marinated.

Even though it was a busy lunch hour all of the staff was pleasant polite and efficient. They came to wipe down our table before we said anything, and were very prompt to clear away our trays, etc.  My husband and I got two short rib tacos, the chips and guacamole, and a large Horchata.  The only redeeming thing about the Horchata was that you got free refills -- otherwise it had way too much cinnamon and didn't taste like authentic horchata. The tacos were ok -- they are reasonably priced but all I tasted was the spiciness with no depth of flavor from the meat. The guac was standard, nothing to write home about.   Might try this place again when I'm in the mood for a burger but for now, it's not something I'll be craving in the near future.",

    "text": "A cool little burger joint tucked away in the Arcadia neighbourhood on Indian School. A definite step above fast food, though not quite as good as some of the gourmet burgers served on Camelback in the same area, like Delux. What looks like a little tin shed outside is an old-school diner on the inside with about 10 tables; also has a drive-thru. Most of the seating is on the covered veranda, with only 2 tables inside, so I imagine dining in during the summer when it is busy can become an issue. The menu is extremely simple - 1 kind of Hamburger, called \"The Standard\", 3 kinds of tacos (veggie, short rib, chicken), side of fries or chips & salsa, and milkshakes. That's it. Makes it easy. The Standard is nice tight little burger that doesn't disappoint. The taste and texture reminded me of an In N Out burger - so if you love those, The Standard is right up your alley. Nothing that special about it, but it's done right, has a solid but soft bun, and the meat has its own unique flavour when mixed with their special sauce. For $5.69 its not the cheapest burger around, but it's definitely worth more than your average dollar menu cheapo burger. The short rib taco is pretty good also - nice flavourful meat. My one complaint might be that there is too much topping of cabbage and salsa etc...I'd rather just savour more of that meat and not let the corn tortilla get too soggy. The service at the counter was rather unremarkable but they were competent, so no complaints.  So that's about it - I can't go back to try more of the menu, because there is nothing else to try. But if I am in the area and craving a quick burger as opposed to one of the Camelback Burger-row restaurants, I'd probably go to The Stand again.",

The bun was soft, the meat was cooked just right.  There was a great meat to cheese ratio, and the pickles and sauce really added the right touch.  The fries were also delish.  Seasoned well and the \"stand sauce\" was zingy and great with the fries.  Didn't have shake, but I'll be back to try one of these bad boys soon.  Almost everyone around us has one and they all looked great.  I also had a bite of the short rib taco, which was good, but for me the burger is where it was at.  Definitely be talking about this place for awhile. It's a good thing for my waistline it's not too close to home...",

First visit today, clean interior, friendly staff, and a refreshingly simple menu. Ordered a short rib taco, fries, and a coke - in a bottle! I know, right? I sat in the outdoor area, and the noise wasn't bad at all (it was around 3:30pm on a Saturday). Food arrived in reasonable time, not too long to have me wondering if they'd forgotten me, and not too quick to have me thinking I was in a McD's.  Very tasty taco, fries that reminded me of Smash-burger (in a good way), and thoughtful presentation. A big step up from a hole in the wall. I hope they make it. Probably back tonight to try the chicken taco.  My advice: don't blink.",

The owners or workers will be sure to stop by your table to check on you, refill drinks, and ensure everything is swell. A detail like that is unexpected in this mega casual sort of setting.   The Stand is very small with only a few tables inside but many more outside on the enclosed patio.  (So on a hot day, sitting outside is not ideal) If you are planning on meeting a group, it may be difficult to find seating. We were only a party of 2 and were lucky enough to grab one of the tables inside on a very hot summer day.  There is a drive-thru as well, if you just want something to go.  If you are looking for one of Phoenix's best new 'hole-in-the-wall\" joints, this is it!  Update: still a fan but knocked off one star bc i dont think the burgers are out of this world.

The tacos are tasty too, though I'm not sure I'd pay 3 bucks for a tiny, not-so-special taco again.  Really they should put 2 per order at that price for the size of these.    They cram too much ice into their beverages too.  I love the ice (tiny cubes, mottled), but they displace so much of the liquid that you don't end up with enough.  They should also do something about the bathroom smell in that hallway when you walk in.",

Once we got our food I went up and asked for sauce for my burger and she gave me two packets. I returned to my seat and we were eating our burgers and halfway as we were finished the employee comes to our table tells us that the sauces are not free that there is a charge for them !!! I can't believe this place had the nerve to come in and interrupt us during our meal for something so minor it's so dumb!!! Either looked at her and said are you serious? I asked are you really going to charge us we were pretty much almost done with their meal? She said yes I have to. I gave her my credit card and she went to charge it. Worst experience I've ever had at a fast food chain with payment. Most ridiculous thing I've ever had to experience. Also the most unprofessional burger chain I've ever ordered from. Will not be coming here due to the unprofessional customer service",

The default is that they come with some sort of salad dressing added, so I had to request it be omitted. I admit I generally prefer only veggies on my burgers. I don't care for pickles, relish, or any sort of slimy crap. The manager seemed offended by my request.  There was no spicy mustard or salsa option. Fries were good, but not in the same league as Z's Greek just down the street. My wife said the tacos were OK, but not up to Julioberto's standards. The interior decoration was very good, a substantial upgrade from the prior incarnation. The place was very clean. The prices were high compared to the other referenced standards. We went on a Sunday, and the place seemed crowded with an obviously after church crowd with many church ladies and kids.",

I may have to go on a heist to steal it from the restaurant or maybe just bribe the guy at the drive-through for the secret?? The burger was more than enough to eat as a meal by itself with two patties and lots of fresh toppings. The meat was well seasoned and juicy, so wear a bib if you eat it in the car. I had burger juice all over my shirt even though it's wrapped in paper. I had to hide my shirt from my dog when I picked her up from daycare. That was the best milkshake I've ever had! The catch: I don't like milkshakes, not even the ones I've made in my home, and I don't order them from restaurants. In fact, I'm lactose intolerant. However, I saw so many pics of this on yelp that I had to try it because..... Now I'm no glutton, but ever since I had that meal (which was incredibly filling by the way), I've been dreaming about going back to get another milkshake and more fries. I almost went back the next day but was afraid the guy at the drive-thru might recognize me. Yikes!!!",

All the right toppings come together! One suggestion: I wished they would serve a single patty burger. Then I may be more likely to add fries or a shake. But after not being able to finish or truly enjoy either after eating the burger, I'm more likely to just get the burger in the future and call it a meal. Plus, I usually treat myself with a burger and don't eat them regularly, so one beef patty is enough to satisfy my craving.",

The burger was outstanding, the blend and ratio of chuck/brisket/short rib is spot on.  I opened the wrapper for the taco and there was a huge chunk of meat, quite a lot of protein for a $3 taco.  The flavors were great, but it was a little dry.  Perhaps if they were to shred the meat and mix it with the basting juices?  Overall a great little local joint.  I knocked them down from 5 to 4 stars because of the service.  While the entire staff was very friendly and personable there didn't seem to be much organization resulting in very long wait times inside the restaurant.  It took about ten minutes to get my food after I ordered, when I walked outside the cars in the drive through didn't seem to move much.  I'll definitely go back, but perhaps just not at noon on a Monday.",

The atmosphere is very cool. Fresh ingredients all around. The owner, this giant who has to duck to walk out of the kitchen, strolls around the front and back of the restaurant and HELPS his staff. We ordered a burger a piece a couple baskets of fries to share (huge portions) and two salted dulce shakes, I opted for diet coke and to try a taco. The burgers were off the chain!!!! They were juicy and flavorful! The shake was so thick it came with a special tube(not a straw) to suck on! The taco was dry , but if u like a good rubbed beef taco u will live it. I went really for the burger so I'm still happy. As we are the giant owner came out and chatted it up with us. You could hear how proud he was of the place and his desire to serve fresh , good tasting food to HIS neighborhood! We will be back!!!  Definitely a stop you must make when diving through Arcadia.",

    "text": "I read about The Stand in the AZ Republic, and I was intrigued by their limited menu.  There is a double burger, and 3 kinds of street tacos: short rib, chicken, and veggie.  They also have fries, chips & salsa, and a variety of beverages...including milk shakes.  I am a sucker for the milk shake, and when I read that they have BOTH chocolate chile and salted dulce de leche shakes, I KNEW I had to try this place.  The very next day, I went with a couple of co-workers.  The first thing I noticed about the place was the big, bright blue BIKE RACK out front.  There is a drive thru, and the place gets busy for lunch.  The service was fast and friendly, but another coworker who went today on my recommendation said she waited a long time in the drive through line.  We found our burgers, fries, shakes and lemonades to be superior, and we all plan to go back to The Stand again.  I hope to be on my bike next time!",

    "text": "I don't write too many reviews on here, mainly because I'm lazy... However I have to write a review for The Stand because I believe people should know how good it is. (And selfishly I want them to succeed so I can keep eating there.)  Starting with the design, clean, modern, minimalistic. The same approach was taken with the menu. Small, clean, and to the point.  Pricing - VERY reasonable for what you get.    Tacos - So far I tried the short rib and the chicken. The short rib packs plenty of flavor and is very well balanced. The chicken was good for sure, I just feel like the short rib is where it's at. (A+ short rib) (B+ chicken) I may be bias on this one...  Burgers - Cheese or no cheese. Fancy toppings optional. I tried \"The Standard\" with cheese. Clean, simple, no bull shit all American burger. Topped with their signature \"the stand sauce\" reminds me of a homemade in n out burger. Tasty to the max. (A)  Fries - Handcut, Real potatoes fried golden and tossed with sea salt. Clean flavor with no greasy after taste. (A+)  Milkshake - Damn they're tasty. In fact, I will go on record saying it's the best I've ever had. I've tried the Banana and the Dulce de leche, both amazing and hand made. Bonus points to The Stand as well for being awesome and supplying a proper big ass straw for a thick shake. If nothing else it's worth the trip and soon to be long wait just for the shake.   Summary - The Stand is not revolutionizing the world in how crazy they can get with their menu by putting over thought shit on there. Instead they took good food and made it better. I can say that after being to most of the burger spots in Arcadia and the Biltmore area that The Stand is one of the best.   P.S. - to anyone who may question this review I want to make it clear that I am in no way affiliated with The Stand either personally or through business. I just happen to think it's really good.",

I ordered the vanilla and she ordered the banana one and decided to add chocolate to it. We were both thoroughly impressed! The shakes are made with delicious ice cream and had the occasional specs of ice in them that separate the \"real\" shakes from the \"made from mix\" ones.  Friendly, professional service as usual from the owners who are dedicated to making their new business a success.",

    "text": "Looks like \"the Stand\" downsized their tacos in a big way. The wedge of lime is almost as big as the tacos itself and then we have the inside of the beef taco which hardly contained any short rib at all. The tacos were good, but not worth $3.00 each, maybe for two, but they have to make a profit somewhere. Look at the other photos and then my tacos - hardly any meat and it took 12 minutes to make two of them when it was only mildly busy. The veggie taco was decent as well, but put some more veggies in there please. Salsa was fresh and full of good ingredients and corn tortillas also seemed freshly prepared. I suppose this could be considered a light lunch, but you will have to add chips or another side for a meal.",

But opted to try it out as i was on a kick of trying new places around my office. I was completely surprised by this place. The short rib tacos are incredibly good as well as the chicken tacos. It's a very relaxed place to eat, nothing fancy on the inside and the patio seating offers a nice breeze. But the tacos are incredibly delicious. I wanted to try their street style corn but it was not in season. They put pickled cabbage on their tacos which was different, not a fan of pickled anything but my coworker thought it was great. Comes with cotija cheese and add the hot sauce with some lime... And it's a great tasting taco and inexpensive lunch. Great place, have eaten there a few times and it had become one of my regular spots.",

    "text": "The Stand is located in the building that used to be Maui Dog for those of us who remember it.  They splashed a new coat of paint on it and upgraded the drive thru.    I did the drive thru on a recent lunch break.  The speaker doesn't work well and the lady was laughing the entire time I was ordering.  Very odd.  Then she asked me my name and if it was cash or credit.  Even more odd.  The entire ordeal felt uncomfortable.  I just wanted to order some food and get back to work.  So 13 minutes and $8.46 later I received my fries and cheeseburger.  The fries were very tasty at first.  I thought they were cajun or seasoned.  They were salted just right and the oil tasted fresh.  After stopping to eat I realized they were slightly burnt and that was why I at first thought they were seasoned fries.  It wasn't bad at first but I realized there was no way I could eat them all and I started to get a burnt taste in my mouth.  The burger was a good size and tasty.  If In-and-Outs double cheese had a step brother it would be The Stand's burger.  Almost identical except the patty was slightly thicker.  It was juicy, cheesy, and executed nicely.  I would definitely order one again.  If not for the burnt fries and price tag this would easily be a 4 star burger spot.  While I appreciate the quality, almost 9 bucks for double cheese burger and fries is too much to become a regular rotation.  And please, it's a drive thru, no need to ask personal questions and payment options.",

    "text": "When THE STAND moved into my neighborhood I was excited. The burgers and fries have always been good. However, they come up short in one area. I now have been there a total of six times. When I first ate there they always seemed to get the order wrong. I credited this to them being new. However, several times later the same thing and I then swore The Stand off. It had been a year since I last went there but tonight my wife and I were craving burgers and I thought I would give it one more try.   This evening I went in and ordered 2 cheeseburgers and two fries. I also got my wife a vanilla shake. The burgers were ordered not to include pickles. I even mentioned it the the cashier that they had trouble in the past getting the orders right.   I arrived home, the burgers smelled great and my wife loved the shake. However, again as appears to be their usual pattern....the order was wrong and one batch of fries was missing..... putting a damper on what would be a great meal..  I thought about not calling but it did upset me so I called and spoke with RON. I told him what happened and I was upset that this had happened to me in the past and I described the employees as idiots. Clearly, this upset him and he told me I could not call his employees idiots and hung the phone up on me. I had to phone back twice and finally got him to speak to me and I asked him about getting the money back I spent on the fries. He told me to come down and get it and hung up again.   I returned and I asked if the tall man was Ron he said he was. He handed me the money and I tried to explain that this was a continuing problem of not getting orders right. He started to go off on me inside and walked me outside...... He was waving his hands at me and telling me how much he cares for his employees. He also told me not to come back and that he could have me thrown out. And asked me if I have ever made a mistake.... and he was making a deal about it only being an order of fries. I did feel a little intimidated by him and the parking lot is really poorly lit. I am sure the customers walking in were wondering what he was yelling at me about.   I told him I had a right to express my opinion and that I did not use any swear words or threats, just that I was upset at a consistent problem of not getting orders right and also I was not given a receipt. He said he had a right not to have me there. I told him I was going to explain my experience on YELP and he said he didn't care about YELP.   Finally, the food is good at The Stand... but clearly RON does not know how to handle customer complaints or that employees would be called idiots after such continued poor service. And now after being there a couple of years they have not worked out the snags with orders. In my opinion Ron clearly needs to learn some diplomacy in dealing with upset customers. And no worries, I will not be back.",

It's quite a drive for us, but we were up for an adventure, and the place is in my old \"stomping grounds\" - the part of the city where I grew up.  This is a place that follows the philosophy of \"do few things, and do them well.\" On this, our first visit, we tried their burgers, fries, and lemonade, but not their tacos or shakes.   Their order-taking process is efficient, and the staff was delightfully pleasant and helpful, always with a smile.   They made my burger \"to order\" - that is, I was able to specific what condiments I wanted on (or left off) my burger. And they got the order right.  They do accept credit cards, too.  The food was DELICIOUS! It was prepared properly, presented simply and neatly, and was hot when delivered. The burger was served with one-half wrapped - so you can hold it on the paper while you eat the uncovered portion. I'm not a fan of this, but that's just me. So I simply unwrapped it completely and at it without the wrapping around it.  The location is rustic and spartan, but it was clean. There was lots of staff busy keeping the place (tables, chairs, floors) clean.  It's a long way to travel for a burger, but the food is good - if you are ANYWHERE in the neighborhood, be sure to drop by.",

Fresh cut fries are always a hit for me. The wait time was about average given the lunch time rush. If it is always like that though it would be an issue. It was difficult to get in the back to park because of the drive thru line that was wrapped around the building and to the street.   All in all, I'd go there again for lunch occasionally since it's close to work and more affordable than the upscale places and better quality than McDonalds.",

Sauce was good but not a fan of 'leaf' lettuce on a burger....shredded Iceberg to me is the best way to go.  did not try the frys but was intrigued by the tacos so I tried their  short rib taco, its was nice  different  salsa was good and fresh.....if I went again  it would only be for the tacos, 'if' I went  Im on the other side of the valley doubtful it would be worth a second trip.",

Small and very crispy, like a whole boat full of the yummy pieces you find in the bottom of your bag when you get fast food.   Service was very friendly. When you dine in they stop by to see how everything tastes and to clear your trays and trash for you which I thought was a very nice touch.

Shake was really good burger was ok (extra for caramelized onions and Niman ranch bacon but in n out is cheaper and tastes almost the same.... The horchata was good very heavy ice.

Probably twelve or so tables or seating areas with both indoor and outdoor seating. If you sit outdoors, note you will be next to Indian School road so it can get a little noisy but it's nice cozy and private area . I had the S'tand'ard with cheese - my wife had the 'Stand'ard without cheese. Comes with all toppings lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle and special mayo-ketchup blend sauce. Great tasting and moist burger (although well-done) and the bun/toppings were fresh. Plenty of burger for the average person. We also ordered one order of FFs. One is a good sized order and the Stand uses shoe string fries (my favorite) and it seem like they double fry them - because they were hot and very crispy. So if you like your fries thin and crispy make sure you get an order. Would definitely recommend the stand for a quick bite when in the area. My wife and I would certainly both go again.",

    "text": "Dined in for lunch with a friend.  There's very limited seating but I managed to grab one of the booths thanks to fortunate timing (and a nice employee asked me if she could wipe it down too).  Limited parking too, but again I had good timing and someone backed out as I pulled in.  There was a pretty good sized group in line ahead of us (five people or so), but the cashier was competent.  The food was delivered pretty fast as well, and I appreciated how many people they had working behind the counter.  Standard burger: The two thinner patties together provided a lot of meat!  The taste was similar to In-n-Out or a meatier, firmer Sonic.  It was okay, but I don't love well-done beef.  Bun was fine, cheese seemed like standard American.  Fries: My generous buddy gave me some of his order of these.  They had a really great herb mix (very similar to Smash Burger's fries) sprinkled on top.  The fries themselves again reminded me of In-N-Out in their shape and texture.  I don't care for how small and greasy they are, and they only taste good when they are hot.  Not bad though, and the server was nice enough to bring extra ketchup (and a bigger water cup for me, which I was grateful for as theirs are ridiculously tiny).  Salted Caramel Shake: Amazing.  This was SO good!  I loved how salty it was.  It had generous ribbons of caramel that I scraped off the side of the cup with my straw afterwards.  It was just the right size, and I appreciated the extra wide, extra strong straw that could handle the thick shake.  Their pricing is very affordable at a solid fast-casual level (more than Sonic, WAY less than Ingo's and Zinburger).  Their pricing is actually HALF of what Zinburger charges for their more basic burgers!  With that in mind, I appreciate this place for what it is: A cheaper alternative to the \"fancy burger\" places, and a solid \"better burger\" restaurant.",

I thought a cheeseburger and short rib taco sounded great, especially considering it came with my two fav ingredients: onion and cilantro. Well I was really hungry, drove into a very busy drive thru and decided to dine in. Only one problem: one girl was working the register for drive thru, naturally, and there was a guy both working as a runner and a cashier which meant I did not get service until 10-16 minutes later . I ordered what I wanted and thought it as nice that they offered free fries on Mondays. So I get my order, decide to find a seat outside and find that my leggings nearly ripped a hole when it got caught on a sharp end on one of the cheap aluminum chairs. Had there actually been a rip I would have been so angry. But only, just a pilled part that I need to scissor off. Also, my taco did not come with any cilantro like it said it would as well, although he food was good.Anyway, I wasn't all that impressed with my first experience. Not sure if it's worth coming back...",

I'm also quite a fan of the fries - they are a bit salty as some have noted, but that tends to be how I like my fries anyhow so no complaints here.  The tacos aren't quite as fantastic - the ingredients sure do taste fresh, but the combination on the whole is just \"good\", not great.  If you're really hankering for a taco, I recommend the short rib over the somewhat bland chicken.  The salsa is a mild disappointment too - the \"hot\" salsa is anything but, though it does have a decent flavor.  Service here is friendly, if somewhat chaotic and occasionally a bit \"too\" friendly (like asking if you need a refill 3 times even after you've said no).  The decor is great, doing a neat job of intertwining the burger shack feel with Arcadia stylings.  The patio is small but nice - completely enclosed, hiding the traffic and noise of Indian School (for the most part).  All in all I strongly recommend The Stand if you're looking for a burger - if you're looking for tacos, though, you may find better options elsewhere in town.",

If you want food fast, go to a burger chain.   The burgers are good. Better than any chain.  If you are expecting the best burger in the world, you're expecting too much for around 6 bucks. They are good burgers and I think they are worth the price.   The fries are....... Salty!  Yes after reading other reviews, I have to agree. They need to change their seasoning to have a third of the amount of salt that they use. It looks like it has other spices like pepper, but still way to much salt and I think they need to watch their temps on the fries as mine was overdone.   The taco I had was the short rib taco. For almost $3 it is tiny. The meat was a little dry, and I'm not faulting anything else about it since mine was togo and food changes consistency when you wrap it in foil. They just need to watch how long they cook the rib meat.  Until they figure that out, you are better off buying another burger instead.   I would definitely go back, and next time I would ask for fries with no salt and to watch the time on it in the fryer.",

They charge pretty much for everything you order, I think even the ketchup and stand sauce. All we ordered was a burger cut in half, an order of fries, two short rib tacos and a coke and large horchata. This was $28 and change! The food was not all that. The horchata was warm and had an after taste like when something has gone bad (sour) I won't leave my in-n-out burger for nothing in this world, amazing food and reasonable prices. We were going to order some shakes after, but with our deception. We were afraid to spend more money and those be bad too! I honestly would have requested my money back. We pretty much tossed everything half through. We didn't like it. It hurt to spend $28 and toss it in the trash. Sorry just our opinions.",

Fries were soggy and very disappointing, burger was mediocre at best.  Friend got a horchata which was entirely too sweet it was more like a syrup, so she asked if she could get something else and it was as if she had three heads, so she just grabbed a courtesy cup of water and took her seat.

Having had it recommended as the most amazing thing ever by a foodie web site, I'm feeling distinctly three-star-ish. So split the difference, as the place is well-intentioned in a flustered way, and neighborhoods need good hamburger joints.  Certainly, it was the best-smelling burger in recent memory. You get two thin, seared patties that are most definitely well-done. Any juiciness comes from the Russian dressing, the tomato, and really first-rate pickles. The fries were workmanlike, if lukewarm. When twilight falls and the Muzak plays Pink Floyd, you will eat the fries anyway.  Y'know... same price as fast food, hipster ambience... I'd eat here again simply because you don't find yourself soaked in grease and self-loathing at the end of the meal.",

She gave up about halfway through hers, so I picked her burger up, removed the bun and toppings, and just tasted the beef by itself.  Yup...great texture, not an ounce of flavor.  So I picked up another chunk, grabbed the salt shaker and poured literally 4 grains of salt on the chunk of meat.  Not a bunch, only four goddamned crystals.    Holy shit, I could suddenly taste the beef!  There was flavor!  It was buttery and rich!  What the fuck?  Did they skip salt?  I don't want a salty burger or anything but crap, use SOME.

    "text": "Elote... maybe this word doesn't spark a culinary craving in the back of your throat like it does for me... but there are few places that have figured out the perfect way to serve roasted corn.  This is only the 2nd place I've experienced this (Elote in Sedona being the first).  Granted, I came here needing food after a night of drinking - so the bacon cheeseburger helped too.  Only other thing I got was a large Dr. Pepper - and they have the good ice, so this was a solid choice.  What I'm saying is, if you are in this area and you need to get something quick that isn't a 'chain', this is a solid choice for sure.  GET THE CORN!",

With that being said, they do have a couple tables inside and a counter to order from, and a drive thru as an alternate option. However, the only food item on the menu is their Standard Burger.  Now on to the good stuff, The Stand's Standard Burger is perfectly garnished and delicious.  Always get with Cheese! The way the burger is presented and wrapped is nothing short of perfection - you would never have guessed it from its outside! Everything is made to order including the fries which I think are some of the best around. They are seasoned well and the Beef is 100% house ground beef.    One word... Shakes.  I have tried Vanilla, Chocolate and Salted Dulce de Leche.  They are all to die for.  The Salted Dulce de Leche was great, but a little to sweet for me. You can't go wrong with the Chocolate or Vanilla :)  Do yourself a favor and swing by!",

I ordered 3 burgers and fries and the wait was just about under 10 minutes, not too shabby. My burger was topped with roasted jalapeno and holy moly they certainly aren't the generic, decorative kind! The real deal jalapeno FYI (appreciate it). My husband compared the burger to In-n-out which I didn't see the comparison besides the secret sauce.. it tasted similar to thousand island. The French fries were crispy, yummy and you really can't eat a burger without fries, amirite?",

This is a no frills burger place. The menu is tiny and that's important. \"We make a few things and they're awesome!\" The Child had a Standard with cheese, fries, and a chocolate milkshake. I had a Standard with cheese and bacon only, fries, and a Mexican Coke. So good and fast. Meat was cooked almost well, but was still extremely juicy. The fries were twice cooked and didn't need any additional salt. The Mexican Coke was the perfect touch and I never do caffeine or soda. The Child's shake was thick and she couldn't finish it.   Whenever I want a burger and fries, this will be one of the few places I go!",

    "text": "My friends had been hyping this burger joint since I landed, so I was eager to see what it had to offer.  One night after they finished work / school, we finally made our way to it.  It has a drive-thru, but we decided to go inside.  My friends told me that they have both burgers AND tacos.... but now it seems this location only has burgers.  Turns out this happened within the last two months, and a new location which they call the GRANDE Stand, opened in Scottsdale... they have burgers, tacos, AND a bar apparently.    So I was limited to a burger, fries and milkshakes.  So what did I do?  I GOT IT ALL!!!  I decided to do the Standard burger, which is a double patty that comes with lettuce, tomato, onion, etc.  I got the fries that come with \"stand sauce\", and I went with the  Banana Stand milkshake... my goodness.  The burger?  Top 3 best burgers I have had, and I don't regularly eat beef anymore.  The fries were bomb too, especially with the stand sauce, though with some bites I found the sauce to be quite salty.  Despite being salty, I absolutely loved the flavor.  As for the shake... I can't believe I once said Checkers / Rally's had the best banana milkshake ever.  No... this shake had big banana chunks in it and it tasted wonderful!  It was visually appealing too, with the yellow swirl on the cup.    I'm sure it disappointed many people that they got rid of their tacos, but their food is great nonetheless.  I don't think I'll be going to In N Out anytime soon.",

The place is literally a stand. A quaint little casita on Indian School surrounded by a some other restaurants and a drive through that was busy the whole time we were eating there.  We both ordered a cheeseburger and fries. We had envisioned that it would be just a single patty cheeseburger so imagine what happened when we got served our hot juicy burgers and found two patties between the perfectly toasted buns and melted cheese?  We were stoked.  I knew I shouldn't be eating a burger this size (it was big to me) but after one bite I couldn't imagine not eating the whole burger.  We could not believe the quality or the taste of this burger. This was hands down the best burger we have had in Phoenix to date. It was hot through and through, every bite was full of flavor and meaty juiciness and of course the cheese perfectly melted and the tomato, onion and lettuce were perfect additions to the burger.  Even though our server told us that the burger would be cooked medium well, this burger was juicy through and through. I love this burger and can't believe it took me seven months to find a burger this delicious and lovingly made. It was out of this world and just like how I imagined if I had paid some fancy Food Network chef to cook one for me. It was that good.  No wonder they get all these \"best of, \" awards. Absolutely deserved.  As far as service, the front of the house staff ringing up our order and serving us were friendly and helpful and quick to bring out our food.  Can't wait until next time, as this is our new favorite burger place in Arizona.",

The shake was so thick and delicious. The fries are seasoned perfectly and the burger was fantastic. You definitely have to get a cheeseburger...the cheese and special sauce make it. It comes with two thinner patties and I actually like that a lot. Sometimes when the patties are too big it makes for messy eats. I didn't get a bite of the taco since boyfriend ate it but he and our friends who have eaten there before said it was awesome.  The staff is fun and pleasant so we will definitely going back here again!",

You can get GF tacos, and they can also make them vegan or dairy-free, which is great. They have gluten-free buns for their burgers - I just wish they made turkey burgers too, and my life would be complete and I'd have to buy them roses every valentine's day! They've got a lot of kids working there, but they are hard workers, so don't be turned off, thinking it's just another fast food joint run by people who don't care about what their doing - their food has real love in it, and it's quick service, with a drive thru that is typically open late.

This is something much more rare, and better than most chain burger places. The Stand has managed to do what most places fail to do, be really good at a couple of items on the menu rather than a lists of only decent items.   The limited menu at the Stand is there for a reason. Order anything on there and it is almost guaranteed to be a satisfying experience for you. Their Dulce de Leche Shake is a nice mixture of milky, carmel-ly goodness that is a nice compliment to their rich and meaty tacos and burgers.   Definitely make a stop here if you ever have the chance!",

They only do buglers and tacos really, they have some sides but those are their specialties.  I went with a cheese burger, and fries, easy order. The burger came with a double patty and basic toppings. I loved it! I could tell it was made just for me and that goes a long way in my book. The fries are great, nice and crispy.  You absolutely have to order the salted dulce de leche milk shake, I have never had something so good in all my life, wow. Salty sweet and creamy, this is a powerhouse of a milkshake.

Things I love: fries are perfect, the standard with cheese and buttered onions is on point, the chocolate chili shakes are out of this world, and I also like a half dulce de leche half banana shake.

It took us at least 30 minutes to order and get our food when there were only four cars in front of us. i can understand how drive-thrus can get backed up. It happens. All the worker had to do was apologize for the wait when we got our food. We complained about the wait and we got a half hearted apology. I would like to go back because the food is good and I want to support a local business. My only hesitation is the long wait. It is hard to wait that long in a drive- thru.",

My only complain is that the short rib taco sauce tasted really salty... Almost too salty.. The flavor is almost good tho. Chicken taco was pretty good as well. Got the hand cut fries, again great flavor but the kitchen put too much seasoning that it was crusting on the side of the plate.  I wanna try their burgers again.

If you show up at lunch, there will be 10 or more people in line and it'll take them at least 3 minutes to take each person's order. So plan on waiting. The people in the kitchen, which you can see, are not busy because the person taking orders is also busing tables and can't take orders fast enough. Unbelievably inefficient. So if you're with a group, the first person will get their food and be done eating before the second person's food even shows up. What a nightmare.",

The Stand sauce is awesome on the burger and the fries. I order my burger with a single patty (the default is two) and the closest burger I can compare it to is In N Out, if In N Out were homemade.  They also have real ice cream shakes, which are tasty. I seldom order them, because who has room after a burger and fries? The chocolate chili shake is lovely but a little strong in spice (at least to me), and the strawberry shake is amazing, full of fresh strawberry. I keep meaning to try the banana shake, maybe next time. You can also customize them, such as ordering a strawberry and chocolate shake, or banana with caramel.  My only gripe is the seating situation. I know the place is small, but when they're busy and you're standing in line waiting to order, it's hard not to feel like you're sitting in the laps of the other diners already seated. The outdoor seating is a little more spacious, and lovely in nice weather.",

    "text": "I had been eyeing this place for awhile! After running into the owner while out and about in Phoenix, I decided to finally go try it because he was so pleasant to speak with.  The place itself is small. If I lived closer I would definitely take advantage of the drive through! The menu is small but that's what I prefer when I go to a burger joint, no messing around just good old burgers and fries! They also have shakes. I got the stand burger with a side of fries.   The food didn't take too long to come out and I was surprised at the size of the burger, it comes with two patties of meat instead of just one! Next time I go I will make sure and ask for just one. The burger was great, had an awesome burger sauce, good quality meat and a fluffy bun. The fries were on point too! To be honest it reminds me a in and out, but this place is small and local which makes me prefer it over in and out.   My only complaint is that the restaurant is so small, and doesn't have the best ventilation so you are literally dining in smoke and you leave smelling like a grill.",

If you love milkshakes you have to go for the Dolce De Leche Milkshake made with real milk and Carmel this milkshake is top notch.

    "text": "My son and I are on a quest to find the best burgers on the east side and The Stand came highly recommended.  They didn't disappoint.    The Stand is, in the most classic and best sense, a burger joint.  It doesn't pretend to be anything but a burger joint.  No fancy fixtures or sexy atmosphere. In the land of Waygu beef burgers topped with heirloom tomatoes and shredded kale served on a brioche bun with mixologists slinging $15 cocktails, this is refreshing all by itself.  We placed our order at the counter with Kristen (who made a great first, second and third impression) and took our Mexican Cokes to our table.  If you haven't tried Mexican Coke, I highly recommend it, especially if you are older and remember the days before New Coke (such a debacle).  As my son predicted, our orders came out quickly and nicely presented.  He ordered the Grande Royale and I ordered the Arcadia.  For about $8, you get a double patty (my guess is between 8 and 10 ounces) with all the fixings you can stack on a bun.  We both agreed that the meat was terrific (juicy and flavorful) and the toppings were fresh and delicious.  He loved the bacon on the Royale and I, of course, loved the grilled onions.  This is another place where you should eat the burger upside down as the bottom bun can get a little soggy.  My son and I parted ways on the fries.  He loved them, especially dipped in the 'Stand Sauce'.  I'm more of a thick cut guy and thought they were OK.  The Stand Sauce is a bit like a slightly spicy aioli crossed with Thousand Island dressing.  It was great.  If you are in the mood for a burger, a real American burger, with good beef, fresh toppings and no pretension, check out the Stand.  You'll thank me after the first bite.",

There is literally only one burg on the menu w/the alt option to add cheese. I got mine w/bacon, no LTO as well because I honestly don't like not having options.   The burg w/cheese was $7 and change. It is a double patty burger and I had mine w/just the cheese, pickles, bacon, and house sauce. I wish they would have acquiesced my request for \"xtra sauce\" because the sauce was tasty. The burger was OK, but not mind-blowing and tbh not worth the stand alone price tag (u have to purchase fries separately). The fries were good.  Don't know that I would go out of my way to come back, but the staff was nice, the small seating area was clean and it has a cult-following for a reason.",

You can add extra add-ons for a $. They also offer Fries and shakes. My friend and I dined in, surprising was not busy. We ordered 2 Standard Burgers and shared an order of Fries. The food came out hot and fresh on a tray. The Fries were amazing! The Burger was good. I'm glad I tried this place.  My only comment is, does the paper wrapped double double burger with special sauce sound like a familiar offering at another well known burger chain that you know of...? If it does then the same order is much cheaper than The Stand for the good Fast Burger and Fries craving.  I would go back only if I was in the area and having a burger attack.

Peach Lemonade was delish! And the fries...Well they were okay, the boyfriend didn't like that there were so many little pieces versus full fries. And I thought they were a touch to salty, but I would gladly order them again! Everyone was really happy to see us, and serve us! The place is sort of small, but it has a patio with a cooling unit on it. I highly recommend this place!!!",

Maybe 5 items on the menu but you can't go wrong with anything. Personally if you haven't bee to this spot order a standard burger with cheese, fries and when they ask you if you want a side of ketchup and stand sauce.. ask for both! Amaaazing!!!",

    "text": "I finally stopped in here after driving by for months; hate to say it, but I kind of wished I'd continued on to 44th St/Thomas and Five Guys instead. As others have noted, it's a very limited menu here, and I went the cheeseburger route tonight. This is an order at the counter place, and then your food is brought out in a few minutes. My cheeseburger was 2 patties of beef cooked to death, not burned but so well-done that the beef was completely dried out, little flavor. Cheese was taste-free. Three thick rings of white onion, two dill pickle chips, a lot of lettuce, and \"Stand sauce\", whatever that is. The white bread bun was as dry as the burger, so no improvement there; its surface cracked while I was eating it. It might have been grilled? French fries were the frozen variety, mostly pieces around an inch long or shorter, varied between crispy (the small bits) and not crispy (the fewer longer pieces). Another reviewer stated that fries were free on Mondays? Not True for me. Full price. Stand sauce\" costs extra. There's better news with the shake:  Deep chocolate flavor, thick, creamy, and a big wide boba straw so you can actually drink it, and the only thing that brought this review up to two stars. There's also Coke hecho en Mexico in 500 mL glass bottles.  Sorry to have to be so negative, but I'm lost as to all these 4-5 star ratings, just don't see or taste it here. I love cheeseburgers, I do, but I couldn't even finish this one. Shocking. I'd have returned it for a do-over, but my dining partner's sandwich was exactly the same as mine, so I don't think it was a fluke. I'll come back to try some of the tacos, and the \"Mexican corn\" sounds good (seasonal spring-summer), but for burgers I'll be dining elsewhere. Life's too short for a bad cheeseburger.",

I was very excited for this place to open and overall disappointed with my experience here. They've done an excellent job with the space and it looks really great. But I have real issues with the food that the decor just cannot make up for.   In my 3 visits, we've had each of the tacos, the burgers, the fries, and the milkshake (pretty much everything on the menu). The burger is whatever (is that american cheese?), the fries are good but nothing crazy and the store bought, dried out taco shells that break in half when you fold em is a straight up disaster. Factor in no beer and I will not be coming back here.   Too bad. Being from the neighborhood I'd like to like this place. But as stated, a better burger and a better taco can be found just down the street.....",

Added Caramelized onions (actually sweated onions) then roasted jalapeno peppers (just canned peppers). The burger was 2 out of 5 stars! Then we go to the the Short Rib Taco's!!! Wow what a disappointment!!!!!!!! The marinade was extremely odd to me! Tasted cinnamon and nutmeg in the meat which totally was not appetizing to me. The corn tortilla was cold and flavorless. Pickled onions weren't pickled long enough at all. Then we have the salsa!!!! Two different salsa's they gave us. First One blended and was lacking flavor all together. Second one.... Well it was chunky and in my opinion it was bottled! Tasted like Pace Picante to me! Absolutely a disappointment!!!! We will never go back! Service was good though!",

Waited a minute more and pulled forward assuming speaker was dead. As I am pulling away I hear someone welcoming me to the Stand and asking me to please wait. The young lady running the drive through 2/19/2018 @ 6:40PM needs to be trained or let go because when a vehicle pulls up it should be immediately acknowledged (especially since there drive through is not properly designed to support being close to the speaker). I went inside to place my order and there was 1 person in the place. The internal staff were proficient and the food did not take long to cook. The food is good here but the prices they charge are close to what I pay at other sit down burger franchises on Camelback.  The Stand was my go to place for convenience since it was a quality burger with a drive through. If they can't fix the drive through they should shut it down completely.",

We do not have out of the ordinary orders- we just get them without buns. Once we ordered all lettuce wrapped and we were brought out gluten buns, we were missing a fry order on another occasion and were never given it after asking about it, and on the latest stop I got very sick after going which means I was cross contaminated somehow.

Another time tried the tacos and it didn't mesh with my palate, I thought they were too sweet.  But I will be back for burgers and fries and of course the milkshakes!",

The fries and shake were excellent.  The service was also excellent.  If you're looking for a really good $5 burger in a casual setting I can highly recommend The Stand.  Also - the outdoor seating was nice - it had a portable AC blower which made it comfortable on a day where the high had been in the low 100's.  Another benefit was that they weren't blasting music in your ear so you could have a conversation at a normal volume.",

Accommodating of allergies as long as you communicate to them. The stand sauce is so good, blows the In N Out special sauce out of the water. Great service too, a lot of younger employees but we always get exceptional customer service. It is a great but dangerous thing that this place is around the corner from my house.",

The seasoning is spot on, the bun isn't soggy from the juices, and the veggies are SO fresh. Also, the meat & veggie proportions are just right. I can be dramatic at times - but seriously this is what I imagine when I crave the perfect burger.  Gotta give it a try. I mean, they even have a drive thru!",

You could get cotija cheese on them if you feel wild.  Everything was fresh, like the faces behind the counter. So young!   The place is kind of small, and probably not suitable for a group bigger than four. Only the inside seats are air conditioned so for the summer you might wanna go at a slower time. The prices are reasonable, you could definitely have some fun ordering a la carte here.   Next time I'll try the elotes.",

The office manager, Kim, who helped us plan our event, was also kind and professional, and made the experience much less stressful than it could have been.

One that you can't get at any fast food place. And I found it. Its restaurant-quality burgers with the convienence of a drive through. Absolutely fantastic. The veggies are all so fresh, like yhey were cut right then just foe me, and the \"stand sauce\" is just right. Its not overpowering and adds just enough to the burger. No need for any other condiments. The Mexican style corn wasn't was I was expecting but it was still amazing!! Corn on the cob with lemon and lime, chili or ceyene or something and parmesean cheese.  This place is absolutely amazing. And I will be back.",

The short rib tacos sounded equally as good and I decided to make the trek from N Scottsdale to The Stand.  Being a late Saturday morning, I expected the weekend lunch crowd.    My eyes might've been a little bigger than my stomach, however I ordered two short rib tacos and one chicken taco and a side of fries.  To say the least, it was worth my trip to The Stand for the tacos as well as the fries that remind me more of Five Guys fries, however with much more flavor.  The manager, Miranda, came out to see how my meal was.  She stayed to talk for a second, noticing that I was a \"newbie\" to The Stand and she was very genuine in her conversation with me (not fake and \"checking off the box with the customer\" like a lot of other places).  In my opinion, The Stand is worth the trip from any part of town and I'll definitely be back!",

Even with this colossal drinking implement you will sooner pop a blood vessel than get any of the sweet elixir to travel though it.   Nope, you gotta pop that lid off and spoon it into your mouth until it melts a little. It's that thick.  Just the way god intended a milk shake to be.  Then theres the chewy chunks of chile that assault your taste buds with a little kick of spice that accompanies the sweet chocolate goodness so beautifully.  Seriously.

The downside is that it's quite the mess, but it's seriously adds to your quality of life to come here occasionally.   Other downside is the size of the restaurant there really is no room and you will have to wait, but this is a great change of pace to any of the chains out there.",

    "text": "I went on a Saturday afternoon. I usually get food for my co-workers and we've been curious to try this place out because it was a diamond in the otherwise rough Indian School Rd. area. I got to the drive-thru at 2:30, thinking that it would be quicker than going in.  I had to be at work at 3, so no problem. Boy, was I so wrong.  As I arrived at the speaker-box, the employee immediately told me to hang on a moment as he was busy with the current customer at the window. No problem: new store, new employees, new things to learn, I understand.   Then ... silence. 5 minutes later, still no response. Cars were starting to pile up behind me so I finally asked if I could order and this is the reply, 'Oh ... yeah, I forgot you were there.'  Cool brah, my self-esteem thanks you.   I ordered a dulche de leche shake, the short rib and chicken tacos, and the burger with fries. When I rolled up to the window, the younger man working the register tells me to wait, again, as the card machine wasn't working and my food would take a little bit. Understatement of the year.  It's 2:55 now and I'm wondering if they're plucking the chicken feathers and scraping the meat off of bones back there because that's the only excuse for having to wait so long. When they finally work things out and hand me my food,  I end up late to work, hastily give out the food to my co-workers, and sneakily eat my own burger behind the counter.   Basically: I don't see the difference in buying a burger from here or 5 Guys even though they say it's made with different ingredients. Both are the same high prices (when you take toppings into account), same patty size, don't come with fries, and they both have excessive juice/oil dripping down my hand. Fries taste exactly like the salt and pepper Boulder Canyon chips except they went a little heavy with the black pepper, and when I asked my co-workers if they enjoyed the tacos, they told me next time to save my money and go to Tacos Sahuayo nearby for something tastier and cheaper.   The only thing i can compliment them on is the dulche de leche shake, but anything else is just alright, nothing special. I hate it when everyone else has a good experience and I'm the odd one out :[",

I had read some of the other reviews and was intrigued by the salted caramel shake. I ordered one and wow! Thick and smooth, not a common combo anymore. The caramel was great and the salted bits really added to the whole thing. I did have some guac and that was pretty good, again nothing super special but better than average. I didn't have the burgers so I can't speak to them. Overall, have a shake, they really are that good but there are better places for tacos",

    "text": "Ok! Got a $20 for $10 deal on Deal Chicken so I had no excuse not to come back and try the banana shake and rib taco I mentioned in my first review. Ohhhh man, that shake is so good. Real chunks of banana in vanilla ice cream blended with banana syrup - it tastes like the best banana pudding you've ever had, only frozen. I'm a huge fan of banana anything (obviously) so this was a real treat for me.  The short rib taco was street taco style with pickled cabbage, onion, and cilantro with some sauce. It was a little spicier than I expected (but I'm really sensitive when it comes to spiciness!) that was probably from the cojita and cremoso or whatever the meat was basted in. It was really good, though! Good thing I had the milkshake to wash it down with. Got the same burger and fries as last time. Muy delicioso.   What I assume is the owner was in again and is super friendly. He commented on my Star Trek shirt and we had a quick chat about the new film while my food was being prepared.   The only con for me is that it's not near my house or anything I ever go to. I wish it was downtown!",

I know, it's pretty terrible. Today I'm off work and flying solo, I finally take my chance and wander in. I'm so very glad I did.  I was immediately greeted by the friendly girl behind the counter, and she took my order deftly. I was pleasantly surprised to find my food ready mere minutes after ordering, and my special-ordered burger (no sauce, tomatoes, pickles; add bacon and onions) was exactly right. The patties were cooked well but still juicy, the lettuce was fresh, and the onions were perfectly grilled. The strawberry lemonade was tasty and just the right amount of tart, but I do feel like they added way to much ice to my cup before pouring. The fries looked a tiny bit underdone, but were still tasty and delicious. I asked for a couple sides of their hot salsa for the fries, it was exactly the right combo.   I'll be back, and I'll even try to sway the missus with promises of what I'm hoping are tacos just as tasty as the burger I ate today. Hooray for another awesome small business successfully making my tummy happy!",

    "text": "F fast food, suckas!! There's a new standard in town. The Stand's Standard burger is a prime piece of meat, made up of chuck, brisket, and short rib (hell yeah!) nestled between a soft, pillowy and buttery bun. It's a fine, quick-served burger with all the right fixins' wrapped in wax paper and served like it ought to be - tasty and a little bit cheesy, assuming you're a big boy and opted for cheese.   This is the kind of burger place that doesn't \"wow\" me to the point of culinary orgasm (see my review of The Old Homestead's burger) but it's not trying to. It's not trying to be something it's not (see my review of Miracle Mile Delicatessen's pastrami sandwich). They're pretty clear about what they are - a brown bag burger and taco \"joint\". They don't say Kobe and give you Sirloin or Wagyu and give you Angus. It's clear. You get a good burger and that's what you get.   One burger with a few toppings to choose from, 3 tacos (short rib, chicken, and vegetable), and a few sides is what they offer out of a small, garage-like space. Side note, the chocolate chile milkshake was awesome too - velvety chocolate with just the right amount of heat to keep you wanting more. They did the place up nice. It has charm with its solid wood tables, steal counters, and awesome employees - smiles ear to ear, friendly \"hellos\" as soon as you walk in no matter what task they're managing at that moment, and a sincere appreciation for walking in, ordering, and chowing. Living in NYC, I get sick of certain niceties. What can I say? It's in my nature to welcome a brutha with a head nod not a smile. Fuggedaboutit! But at The Stand, I felt True sincerity and I appreciated it. In fact, I was all about it. Congrats to the owners for wanting to open up a burger joint and succeeding.   So get your a$$ off the pot, cleanse yourself from the garbage you eat for lunch, and go to The Stand, mutha sucka!",

    "text": "I had wanted to come here a few times before but it never worked out.  One time it was closed, the other time I was still full from lunch.  I was in the neighborhood today and a burger sounded alright.  I walked in and placed my order for a Standard w/cheese and an order of fries.  My total came out to almost $9.00.  Eek!  One reason it can't be higher than 3 stars.  I paid my money and took a seat.   Side story here..............  When I was sitting there waiting for my food, some young dude was either getting interviewed for a job, or he was freshly hired and the manager/owner?  was breaking down the expectations/rules etc.  I pretty much got a front row seat for the way The Stand works.  I got financial info, customer service info, cleaning tips etc etc.  I will be sure to take my knowledge to the next board meeting and present my findings accordingly.  Anyways.....some of the conversation was interesting, some of it was lecturey.  A few minutes went by and my burger and fries came out.  Here is how they were.  Standard Burger w/cheese ($5.55) -  This burger is a more pricey In N Out Double Double.  The only difference is the lettuce they use.  They use hand leafed dark lettuce here while In N Out uses a romaine style lighter colored lettuce.  2 patties, cheese, onions, tomatoes, sauce and pickles.  All of this is stuffed between what seemed like an egg type bun.  The burger was pretty good.  The overwhelming taste/ingridient was definitely the pickles.  They were good too.  The beef was fresh, the cheese melted well and overall it was a pretty good burger.  A little pricey though...its like $5.55 plus tax, just for the burger!  Fries ($2.29) -  These were hand cut fries.  They season them nicely with both salt and pepper.  They were pretty crispy and tasted good.  I preferred them over an In N Out style fry.  I would get them again.  Overall, the meal was good but not great.  The burger was tasty and the fries were crispy and seasoned well.  It is very expensive for what you get though IMO.  I am glad I tried it out, but I'm not purposely coming back and driving down here to eat here again.",

I learned that they have a gluten-free bun option which is a pleasant surprise for an in-and-out style burger and will try it on my next trip.  The staff was extremely pleasant - welcoming on my first visit and I'm pretty sure every single staff member asked me what I thought and they even addressed me by my name.

They have the efficiency of of fast food joint and the attentiveness of a sit-down restaurant. Someone will usually come out on the patio to check if everything is good, and take away trays and trash. Most recently when we visited the tall guy I always see working there (owner?) stepped outside as we were leaving from the patio to say goodbye and wish us a goodnight with a smile and a wave.  It was such a simple, yet friendly gesture that made us feel like we are always welcome back.  I will make it a point to support this local business when I am craving burgers and shakes because they have quality food and I love their dedication to making their customers feel valued. If you have had a disappointing experience with their food I highly recommend giving them another chance.",

I saw a bag on the to go counter and asked if that was mine.  I waited 10 minutes and after that paid and got the bag only to find out that the fries were COLD.  I said I wanted warm fries which they said they would do, but then I thought that means that the burger and taco that I got would even be COLDER.  I will never go back!!!!!!!!!!!!!",

I always order the veggie tacos (best I've ever had), fries with stand sauce (sauce is really good) and the Salted Carmel Dulche De Leche shake which is sooooo yummy. I highly recommend every one try that shake.",

We were sharing. :)  Food wasn't too bad, but the place is a bit overrated in my opinion. I really liked their simple menu and friendly staff. However, their items were not worth four stars. Their burger was very mild - meaning no flavor.   Not sure which part of the beef that they use but I can tell that they are using quality beef but it lacks flavor. Fries were super soggy but tasted pretty good. I did like their sauce though. Tacos were pleasant but not something that I would crave for or want to go back for.  Overall, it was just OK for me.",

I had to wait around 5 mins...no big deal, I want fresh food. The burger was huge and had double patties. Everything about it was bland. The burger tasted purely like grease, the lettuce tasted dirty and it was just plain gross. I'm new to the area and really wanted to try out and support local businesses, however this place  will not get my support. My stomach felt queezy the rest of the evening, I'm sure due to the abundance of grease. It dripped from the burger and every bite just seemed like a bland  deep fryer mess. In and out and Culvers have way better burgers for much less. I paid 6.00 for just the burger here and I would pay more if it was a good burger, but the stand just isn't up to my standards. Soo disappointed. Looks like I'm still on the search for a good local burger joint close to my house.",

I always get 2 of their 3 tacos: short rib, chicken, and they have a vegetarian option as well which is a point in my book. Their tacos are 4/5 in my opinion. The meat is sometimes dry and can be a little too sweet sometimes but they're the perfect size and filled with yummy pickled toppings. Less than $3 each. I also don't come here without an order of chips & guacamole. Chips taste homemade and are served warm which I like! The serving of their guacamole is a little small, not the right ratio of chips to guacamole unfortunately. I had the chance to try The Standard burger for the first time and it is perfect! So close to In-N-Out which is awesome because there is none in the Central Phoenix area. And extra side of The Stand sauce is a MUST. So close to the thousand island flavor of In-N-Out spread. YUM! Every time I come here and see Mexican street corn on the menu, my mouth waters but they never have it when I come in! It's either sold out or out of season. So sad. On the bright side, they have Horchata and other traditional Mexican juice drinks which are always available. The Stand is definitely a must try.",

The last time I went to The Stand, my fiance and I stood in line for about 15 minutes ... with just one other person in line in front us. That person ordered a single milkshake, and it took him that whole 15 minutes to get it.  When we finally moved to the front of the line, we stood there awkwardly, waiting for someone--anyone--to acknowledge our presence. I counted 5 people working behind the counter that night, and not one of them made eye contact with us. After 5 additional minutes in line, we gave up and walked out.  I'd like to reiterate that this experience wasn't an isolated incident. I think a lot of people (myself included) ignore the crummy service here because the food is so good, but when you've given this place as many chances as I have, the whole thing gets kind of old. I really want to support this local business, but they make it so tough.  GET IT TOGETHER, you guys. For the sake of your glorious shakes and burgers.",

I've seen a red headed employee grab money from tip jar then turn around a grab a burger on a tray with bare hands. I'm sitting here now waiting for my food and seeing this.  Service and sanitation need help!",

There's just a little bit of sand under your nails. It's several decades ago.   Time moves slower, service moves correspondingly. Burgers and fries are done simply and well, with no attempts at extra flare - unless you count Stand Sauce. It's not bare bones, it's classic in a way that makes one nostalgic for the idea of a time they may or may not have actually lived in.   Overall, it's a welcome helping of affordable simplicity in a culinary wonderland neighborhood laden with more expensive, modern burger-things.",

    "text": "I've just gotten back from my second visit to The Stand and feel inclined to update my first 5 star review to a 4, now having gotten over my \"first date\" giddiness and tried the tacos.  As promised, I went back today to try them (tacos). Well, they weren't as nearly as good as I had hoped. I ordered one short rib ($3) and one chicken ($2.50), along with another burger (yes, I'm a glutton).  Neither taco came even close to knocking my socks off. Don't get me wrong, both were good, but thats it. The short rib taco was the better of the two, mainly because of the addition of the cotija cheese which was the most flavorful part of either of them.  Both were shredded meat and neither had that punch of flavor I (and every one else) is looking for in a taco. The chicken was a little grainy with much too fine of a shred with almost no flavor. Put some seasoning on that thing!  Short rib is short rib, nearly always great, but theirs lacked that succulent richness that I look for with that type of meat.   They also ask if you want mild or hot salsa ON the taco. I asked for the hot, but on the side because I didn't want the salsa to take over and I had no idea if it was good or not. Boy, I'm glad I asked for it on the side. It is chunky SALSA, not a smooth hot SAUCE, which i prefer on a taco. Excellent for chips, but not on my taco, and it was nowhere NEAR the realm of spicy. My Mom could eat bowls of the stuff.  Considering two stars is \"Meh. I've experienced better\", these are definately a two. With places like Gallo Blaco out there, the taco battle is a tough one to enter, nearly as tough as the bigger burger war that they have also entered.  I did get a cheeseburger that was as good as the first. Quite good and fresh tasting, and a 5 star burger, but only because of the price point.  Service is also excellent. In fact, couldn't be better with them clearing your plate when you finish and having smiles all around. Definitely 5 stars for that. The place was MUCH busier than last week which is a good thing.  Keep your charm, The Stand. I'll be back, but its burgers only from now on.  A side note... I think us Yelpers can sometimes be TOO picky. I'm guilty of it too for sure. We want EVERY burger to be the best we've ever had, every taco to leave us speachless. Well. I'm not sure that every place is meant for that, or even tries for that. How many stars does good food at a good price garner...? With the competition out there can a place like that even stay in buisness? I dunno. Just something for me to think about I guess.  PS - I do agree that adding the choice of green chilis or a fried egg would be a spendid option. I too and am absolute whore for a fried egg on a burger.",

The burger was legit... very large, juicy, and flavorful like a burger should be (not a fancy type burger.... a casual type burger). It comes with two patties (why no one patty option?), cheese, lettuce, tomato, 'secret sauce' served on a buttery bun. It was definitely good for a drive through burger. I think it would be made much better if I got my own burger and added jalapenos and grilled onions (which the husband doesn't like), but I'll find out next time. The shake was also decent (I don't love shakes)... it tasted like straight up chocolate ice cream, which isn't a bad thing. The service was fast and personable. If I were craving a drive through burger again, forget In and Out, I'd stop here.",

    "text": "Decided to check out The Stand to satisfy a burger craving. I appreciate how small and simple the menu is - do a few things, and do them well! I ordered a burger, Mexican Street Corn (I guess they figure we don't know what \"elote\" is), and a short rib taco.  Apparently, the elote is on backorder. The gal who appeared to be in charge told me the vendor didn't have any, but they should be getting some in Monday. I can only hope she just meant fresh corn and they really prepare the elote fresh there. It's simple enough - no reason to order it in pre-made and just heat it. I decided to order fries instead. The place is super clean, and all of the staff is friendly and seem happy to be there.  When receiving my order, I noticed the burger was falling out the bottom of the bag. Not only were they quick to apologize and give me a new (double) bag - they added in a second order of fries since it seems I lost some to the first bag. While I appreciate the customer service there, and felt they were really on point - the last thing I need is a second order of fries. Had I been paying more attention, I would have thanked them but refused. The short rib taco is well executed, but about $1.00 too high. I am spoiled by plenty of close and solid taco options - for $3.00, a tiny street taco better be a revelation. It was good - but certainly not amazing. Beef, cilantro, pickled onion and cotija. Tasty, but not a great value. The fries are quite good - but not fantastic. And the burger was meh. Nothing wrong with it. The patties were seasoned, bun and veggies fresh - but nothing stellar or phenomenal about it. I'd put the quality up there with 5 Guys and Habit - and of the three, will support the small, local one. So yes, I am sure I will be back - there was nothing wrong with it and the staff are a treat to deal with. I just wasn't \"wowed.\"",

That's what made it even more satisfying to find that the food didn't disappoint! I got the standard double patty cheeseburger with grilled onions and a grilled jalapeno plus a side of fries and a salted dulce de leche shake. I enjoyed all of it. The other reviews on Yelp hit the nail on the head when they describe it as a sort of pseudo-in-n-out. I would say they are pretty similar in many ways but I'd also say they have some key differences. I can only commit to saying I like both in different ways. The jalapeno and grilled onions are a must when ordering a burger here, I like anything and everything spicy so the fact that they spread the whole jalapeno out on the burger (with the seeds) instead of little slices from a jar made a world of difference and gave it a glorious kick. The fries were my cup-o-tea, similar to in-n-out. My man thinks they were a little soggy for his taste but I thought they were just as soggy at in-n-out and I devoured them. The shake was AMAZEBALLS but I definitely think I might have gone into diabetic shock after sharing one with Eric. The staff was really nice, but really slow. We waited for half an hour for our food and when we finally got it we asked if it would've been faster to go through the drive thru and they gave an honest answer (which I admire)-- they're just slow. lol Can't hate on the truth! They are fairly new so I bet they will speed up the service with more experience. Can't wait to come back!",

It also showed it was affordable. So hey why not try. We first pull up and the parking is chaos. No light whatsoever and barely any room to park. So we go in and the place looks cute. As we look at the menu they really don't have much options. We both ordered chicken tacos and an horchata water. As we go to our booth I notice something weird on the wall and roof. Come to find out they were flies!!!!! Lots of them. Disgusting dirty flies all over the wall and roof. My husband brings it to the attention to one of the employees and she says \"oh it's okay they don't go near the food.\" 20 min later we get our tacos and they are of decent size but for less than that I can get delicious AUTHENTIC Mexican tacos. Because being from Mexico City I can guarantee these are not authentic. The chicken taste like can food chicken. Oh and the water taste like milkshake not horchata!!!!! So in conclusion please save your time and money and go somewhere with actual Mexican tacos oh and that doesn't have flies. Yuck!",

Order came out quickly. First thing I tried were my buddy's fries, and I give them an A+, lightly peppered and slightly salted without a ton of grease, cut from potatoes with skin on. My burger and taco came out, and I went burger first. They're thinner double patties, thick butter pickle slices, tomato slice, American cheese, lots of very green lettuce, onion, and some kind of sauce. It blended together nicely, but the bun was very plain (easiest area that would take the burger to the next level). Beef tastes good, but it's not grass fed, could taste fresher...I give it an A-, but must admit it hit the spot. The taco was average,I got chicken. I give it a B-. Overall, really good burger, great fries, average taco. Half liter bottled coke is always nice touch. I hear they have good milkshakes, but I don't have room to try one. Give it a shot.",

Sometimes you just crave a good burger, and though there are some good ones around town (and no, not BK, McD, Sonic, or even 5 Guys) I wanted to try this place.  Blown away! Just the standard with cheese and a roasted jalapeno. Bun toasted and tasty, held up under the luscious middle. Lto crisp and fresh. 2 burger patties perfectly cooked and juicy, nice combo of ground beef mixture, it wasn't like a meatloaf (I hate that) and melty American cheese. Mayo I think, and oh yes, for me some toasty pepper for some heat!  Omg it was probably the best burger I've had.......ever!  It was a nirvanic experience that was over much to soon!  Add to that quick, efficient and friendly drive thru service. Five stars easy!!  This wonderful meal has barely hit my belly, and I've never written a review as immediately....  I'll def try the tacos but if I get a burger craving (I get them at least weekly) I'm headed here! I'm telling you to do the same!!!!",

Without a doubt, without hesitation, or fear of contradiction, the absolute best thing on their menu - and it's only there for a few months each summer - is their homemade Lemonade. Really?! Yes! I drive far out of my way just to get it, and I pester them with phone calls several times each spring asking them if they've started making it yet. They have a classic lemonade and often a seasonal lemonade such as peach lemonade, both of which are not just to die for, but are addictive. Yes, I know you've had lemonade before, but not like this. Warning - it is probably the most tart lemonade you will ever drink and it is sweet, but it's flavor is so strong that it makes your eyes roll to the back of your head in delight. With their peach version, you'd swear you were eating a peach. You take that drink and say \"boy that was tart\" and you stop, then almost immediately, uncontrollably you must have more and it goes on like this until even their large size is totally gone. Trust me - tart, sweet, addictive. The best you'll ever try. Now if I can only get them to keep it on the menu all year round!",

The staff is friendly and enthusiastic - they seem to genuinely like working there, and keep things running quickly.  I am hooked on The Standard (with cheese, of course) - a juicy, cheesy creation of beauty pillowed within a fresh egg bun.  I choose to have mine without onions or tomato, keeping the fresh crisp lettuce and crunchy pickles.  Just the right amount of sauce rounds out this treat of a burger.    What is a burger without fries?  The Standard's fresh-cut fries are fantastic.  Not at all greasy, the portion is more than enough to share.

    "text": "A burger stand & a taco stand.  Allow me to stand and applaud.  Okay sorry that was cheesy (no pun intended), but seriously I'm over the moon for this place.  I feel like this place follows the Apple model Steve Jobs preached for so many years.  Elegant simplicity.  The Stand is indeed a simple place with a simple menu but with elegant quality to their food.  Maybe you think I'm overstating things, but truthfully I just love when restaurants focus on doing the simplest of things well.  Oftentimes those that try to be great at everything aren't good at anything.  The Stand knows what they're good at, and they execute beautifully.  I came here Friday after work for an early dinner with a craving for three specific things.  A tasty burger, a tasty taco, and a milkshake (not necessarily in that order).  The Stand has a drive thru, but I decided to dine in this time around.  The inside is a small setup with a few booths and a couple of high tables that can fit maybe 12 people total.  The covered outside patio can seat about double that, but with a name like The Stand you'd probably expect a smallish size place.  Like I said, the menu is simple.  There's one burger option (with a few possible customizations), three taco options, as well as a few side options.  The drink options are much more abundant in variety ranging from lemonades to sodas to milkshakes.  For my visit today it was as follows.  A standard burger with cheese, a chicken taco, and their famous dulce de leche milkshake.  Total cost including tip was $15.  Let's start with the burger.  A mixture of chuck, brisket, and short rib (yup, short rib).  Fresh ground and made to order with onions, pickles, tomatoes, lettuce and their own housemade sauce.  This was glorious.  The burger is actually two patties so plenty of meat in each bite.  Meat was cooked perfectly and insanely juicy.  Heck even the toppings were great with each being cold and crisp like they'd just been cut on the spot.  I'd say this makes my burger top 5 here in the valley.  Next, the chicken taco.  Corn tortilla, roasted chicken, cotija cheese, queso fresco, pickled red onion and cilantro.  Good clean flavors with a little heat from the chicken and a mellowing from the cheeses.  The tortilla held up perfectly and didn't break apart after biting into it and had a pleasant texture.  Lastly, the shake.  Made with sea salt, Mexican caramel, and vanilla ice cream.  This is The Stand's calling card and I can see why.  That perfect mix of the sweet and the salty with savoriness of the caramel to boot.  A delicious, smooth, satisfying cap to the meal.  Its so simple, yet so awesome.  A proud Arcadia neighborhood joint that delivers on exactly what they advertise.  A small but mighty restaurant with fantastic food.  I now understand why so many stand up for the freestanding wonder that is The Stand **ducks tomato**.",

So, my lunch companion  and I thought it might be a good place to stop and have lunch.  The menu at The Strand is simple and straightforward, one burger, a few tacos, sides, drinks, and shakes. On this visit I had  two Braised Short Rib tacos, and fries. My lunch companion had the \"The Standard\", that's what they call their burger with fries.  The braised short rib tacos were delicious. I thought the taco would would be the typical street taco, however the pickled onion, cabbage, adds something your typically Street Taco doesn't have, and made for a delicious taco. My lunch companion said the burger was delicious as well and the fries are fresh cut, not frozen, crispy, and were absolutely the best  The staff at The Strand are friendly and attentive. There is very limited seating inside and they have a enclosed covered patio outside (not cooled) similar to the  burgers stands you would see by the beach. Can you enjoy Burgers and Tacos you should give this trend a try. The food was fresh, delicious, and reasonably priced.",

You finish your meal and you plan your next visit to The Stand as you're wiping the corners of your mouth and smiling. There's one more tiny crispy fry in the basket- don't leave it there all alone!  To me, the burgers taste like a lot like In N Out at the basic level of meat and bun but there's another level of flavor to them and I don't know if it's from the quality of meat itself or from how it's cooked. It's not a thick half pound patty of ground beef, it's a thin pair of patties grilled on a flat iron and they have a delicious crust on each side imparting all kinds of ridiculous flavor.   I've brought friends from out of town here and they couldn't believe how incredible the burgers and fries are and were saddened to learn that it's not a franchise that could show up in DC or NYC for their dining pleasure.  Mexican Coke on ice with a burger and fries at The Stand is bomb.",

Great service, clean location. Cold A/C. I love the business model without the pretentious atmosphere of most \"back to basics\" burger joints.  Prices are fair, food is delicious and I feel it shouldn't be overlooked. Waited a short time, but it was very reasonable given most food looks cook to order. I really want to go back to try the shakes as they looked great.  Only gripes to me, is that the outside seating area could use some airflow, and the fries were a TINY bit overdone for me - but delicious nonetheless.

I had a burger with jalapenos, cheese, onions, lettuce, and tomato (heaven in my mouth). The fries were soooooo delicious. My boyfriend and I got one fry which was perfect because the burgers have a double patty...such a pleasant surprise. They have their house sauce on the burger which I decided to have on the side to try and let me tell you....I am NOT a sauce person. I hate any house sauce restaurants have (this includes in-n-out)....however The Stand has sauce that was great for their burger and their French fries.  The customer service was great! Very kind people which just makes for a great environment!   Long review short, go on Monday before 3 to get a free fry and their burgers are one of the best I've had...and I've had LOTS.",

    "text": "On the east coast where I'm from, it's not uncommon to find In-n-Out clones, because the franchise doesn't really go any further east than I think Dallas.  Many try to copy the formula, and some put out a somewhat decent burger, but when the day is over, they're still no In-n-Out.  During a day trip in Phoenix, I was really craving hamburgers, so doing a cursory search for burgers, The Stand's name came up several times on various aggregate sites and lists that were pertinent to the best burgers of Phoenix.  And this wasn't my first time in Phoenix, so I was aware that there are In-n-Outs in the general metro area, but when I travel, I typically want to try new things.  Needless to say, The Stand is undoubtedly an In-n-Out clone as far as I'm concerned, but I don't necessarily mean that as a pejorative.  Typically, I wouldn't imagine a clone to be in an area that actually has the original, but here we stand.  Regardless, The Stand seems to have captured the loyalty of the locals, and on top of the Internet praise they get, they've captured some legitimate titles within the city proper itself, shown on the walls of the restaurant upon entering.  Speaking of which, The Stand is located on Indian School Road; I know this describes nearly 30% of the businesses in the metro area, so it's like on the part of Indian School Road kind of due north from ASU.  Without a rental or Ubering, I was able to get to it very easily on public transportation, using the 41 line on the Valley Metro bus, with a stop maybe 25 steps from their door.  The exterior of The Stand looks like it used to be a fast food restaurant, but at some point the zombie apocalypse came and went, except The Stand didn't bother uncovering the Windows.  That's my trying to be funny way of saying that it's kind of a window-less building surrounded walls you can't see through, but the interior is kind of a typical restaurant.  Small, but not unlike most.  Service was super friendly and nice, but I have to say that it was kind of slow.  I see some redundancies in how the employees operate, and it leads to some slowdown in taking orders, and I wondered why they only dedicated one register for inside orders, one for the drive-thru, but didn't utilize the third one at all.  It wasn't at all an efficient visit, but the food was still top notch and capable of overlooking the speed.  As stated, the menu is basically an In-n-Out clone.  There's something charming about the simplicity of a place that literally only serves a hamburger with/without cheese, fries, shakes and soda.  Admittedly, the \"burger AND taco\" description of the place was what drew me, because who wouldn't want a burger with a side of taco??  But I discovered that The Stand no longer served tacos, and a part of me was I'm not mad, just disappointed by the revelation.  Seriously, that was a huge letdown, and the business is in serious need of a renaming because that's straight up False advertisement.  Whatever though, the burger was fresh, and tasted about as good as an In-n-Out experience.  I will say that I actually liked The Stand's fries more, as they actually season them, instead of just being given old and crusty salt and pepper packets.  However, the price wasn't very In-n-Out like, since my burger, fries and a lemonade ended up ringing me $14, which is almost twice what the classic In-n-Out #1 costs.  DIdn't think about it until after the meal, but yeah, they can get pricey for a burger-fry-drink meal.  Overall, I was definitely satisfied with the product at The Stand.  It warrants the praise it gets, but from an encompassing experience, I thought their service was slow and the price a little high.  The food and the friendliness are big pluses for them, but in the end, I'll go with a 4, rounded up from a theoretical 3.5.",

    "text": "This is a No-Frills deal burger joint! The menu is extremely simple the standard Burger with lettuce, tomato, pickles, and their sauce, with two patties with or without cheese. You can add bacon for $2 more, or butter grilled onions, or roasted jalapenos. There a lot of hype on the fries so they are definitely worth grabbing!  The burger: Since I have eaten here twice I think I have a great idea and just as good of a perspective is anyone else who's eaten here. Their burgers our made to perfection simply put! The patties are round, juicy seasoned extremely well and not salty or too much seasoning, you still can enjoy the taste of the beef. Both times I had the burger I got everything on it minus lettuce and tomato and I added the bacon, the grilled onions, and the roasted jalapenos. This was an extremely good burger! I tries one of the other burger places here and I would say this one is Light Years better than the other place and is it about $3 cheaper per Burger!  Grades: Burger- 9.75 Fries-8.5",

I'm glad that I asked because I only wanted 1! I probably could've eaten two but this gal really only NEEDS one. ;) The burger itself had so much flavor and I loved all of the toppings, including their special sauce! My only complaint was the bun. It was a little dry and not anything special. In fact, I may order it wrapped in lettuce next time and forget the bun altogether.   THEIR FRIES. Holy heaven, you must get these! They are hand cut and have the most delicious seasoning on them. I could literally eat these every single day and be the happiest camper.   Since it is right around the corner from our house, I'm sure i'll be back!",

If you want it another way, you get story, about how the health department will not allow them to serve them rare, medium or medium rare.   With so many good and accommodating restaurants in the area, I passed on the Hockey Puck. I'd give it one start if I'd have tasted the over cooked meat.

Since In-n-Out's leadership changed their burgers are smaller and less appealing, after trying The Stand food I won't be an In-n-Out customer going forward.  The Stand is a must try for a remarkable priced burger with crunchy seasoned fries and a yummy shake!  The shake cost may seem high for the portion but it's too yummy to pass up the \"Salted Dulce de Leche\" shake!  If you dine in seating is limited and the A/C is just right in this AZ heat!  The friendly customer service and speed of what is delivered was impressive considering the massive line at the drive-tru.  Enjoy!",

I've been going here off and on for several years, and about half the time my burger is very pink. When I order and ask that it be \"well done\" I'm told they won't share it with the cook, because all their burgers are cooked thoroughly. They are not. Today, for the first time in months, I ordered at The Stand and again got a very pink burger, even though I again asked for it well done. Bottom line-don't try this place if you expect to be heard or respected as a customer. There are lots of other burger joints happy to accommodate simple requests like mine.",

The inside is small with about six tables ranging anywhere from a two seater to a six seater along with the patio on the outside. And on a busy night I could see this place getting very cramped inside.  I ordered the standard burger with fries in the Dulce de Leche Shake. The best way I can describe the burger would be like the good backyard burger with all the fixings of lettuce tomato with 1000 Island spread. The fries were excellent not too crispy and not too soggy with a tender center.  Some say that Dulce de Leche was stolen by Prometheus from the gods. After tasting this drink you will be unable to deny that it is something from the divine. My only complaint is that this drink was a tad too sweet for me but if you have a sweet tooth then this drink would be perfect for you.",

The fries, on the other hand, are sub-par. They are soggy and tasteless.   It makes me sad to see The Stand get rid of what made them unique. The last thing Arcadia needs is another burger spot.

Was not best burger I have had but the old coke signs etc along with the friendly staff make it a comfortable local feel. The shake was the reason to go back it was the perfect combination of Carmel and ice-cream. Perfectly thick without being to hard to drink from the large straw. The only disappointment was they had a chicken wing special that was sold out.. overheard young ladies in adjoining booth talking about how wonderful the final orders were and this was the only place they wanted wings.

The Stand burger is a classic American cheeseburger, and it's done well, but is that enough? Within a couple of miles of the stand there are some great options for burgers, and while the price is good and the service is good I feel like The Stand is missing something. Maybe it's because the bun was a little stale on all three of our burgers today. It made eating the burger a \"meh\" experience. Everything else was fine. The burger is cooked and seasoned well, the shakes are delicious and the fries and so so good. But when you have such a small menu and you serve burgers with dry buns it kind of weakens the experience for me.  It's a cool place, so I'll be back - I'll just stop by In N Out in the meantime to clean my palate.   3.5/5",

It's so good I'm sure they have won awards for it.  (2) The standard, which I ordered without cheese on a gf bun, was surprisingly dry, but to their credit all the ingredients were fresh. Maybe the regular bun would not have been so dry? Maybe the fat content of the burger was lower than I'm accustomed to?  (3) The water cup was served in the biggest cup I've ever seen which was a nice surprise.  (4) The fresh cut french fries were suuuuuper tasty. They reminded me of fries you'd make at home.   (5) Drive thru service was slow. But, I think that's normal for this restaurant.  (6) Customer service very good and I did not notice anything that needed to be improved upon during my visit.  Overall, I'd definitely return for that short rib taco and fries....the burger?...not so much.",

As a 10+ year resident in the area, it truly saddens me to post this, but at this point it's just a lost cause & the least I can do is hopefully help someone else to save some time/cash/disappointment. Used to come here & the burgers were cooked to perfection, everything was fresh, the milkshakes were delicious & the employees were friendly. Now the burgers (along with the milkshakes) are hit & miss depending on who is in the kitchen, they continuously mess up your order (as if they actually have more than 3 items on the menu), the folks in the kitchen spend the bulk of their time goofing off rather than putting some effort into the quality/preparation of the food that you're paying them to make, the food is VERY pricey for what you get, & (worst of ALL, in my eyes) the people who take your order are SUPER snobby. Like seriously, no \"hello\" or smiles when you walk in the door anymore, & as you stand there looking at the menu on the wall, they don't even ask how they can help you (or even acknowledge you for that matter). This one small-framed/nerdy (Asian/Latino?) girl just stands there w/ these thick coke bottle glasses on & blankly stares at you instead of asking if you need any help or asking you if you have any questions about the menu/etc. Basic customer service etiquette that even someone like myself could master in minutes... I thought the 1st time might have been a bad day for her, maybe she was on her period or something, so I came back & yeah; Had the exact same experience with her... Like she's a robot or something, & you're paying her to be as bland as possible. Awesome.   Order a burger here now; Expect to have to send it back 3+ times until they actually cook it right/as you actually ordered it. Order a milkshake here now: Expect it to be either super thick (to where you can't even drink it) or \"whipped\" to a point where it tastes more like pure whipped cream rather than an ice cream shake. When made right (aka- with the type of meat you actually requested [i.e. chicken vs short rib]), the tacos were great; The keyword here is \"WERE\" because of course they took the tacos off the menu... When it came to the uniqueness of how it was made & quality, my favorite was the Guacamole & YUP you guessed it: They took that off the menu as well (shortly after hiking the prices). Catching the downward trend yet? You should be.  What's that?? Ohhh, you're on a tight schedule & wanna save some time by goin through the drive-thru? GOOD LUCK... Unless you have no cars in front of you, you're gonna be waiting upwards of 10-15 minutes, regardless of the time of day & regardless of how small your order may be. Whether you use the drive-thru or walk in, you better demand a receipt because they sure won't give you one otherwise (even though they sure WILL remember to have you sign THEIR receipt if/when you pay with a card). \"Oh come on, you didn't get a receipt, what's the big deal\" you ask?? For those on the slow side (including but not limited to some of the folks who work at this place); If you go out to eat somewhere & get SICK (food poisoning/e coli/salmonella/etc), you have no case if you have no receipt to prove that you ate there. Think about that the next time you go here (or anywhere else for that matter) & have to deal with folks who constantly act like they don't want to provide you with a receipt for the food you're about to consume.   I used to really love this place & frequently recommended it to MANY people, but the recent lack of consistency in terms of the quality/preparation of the food, in addition to the lackluster customer service (& piss-poor attitude of the folks who take your cash) has caused me to take my business elsewhere. I'm sure that losing one long-time customer won't hurt them too bad, but if they lose enough customers (which is bound to happen if things remain as they are now) it could spell danger for the company as there are MANY more options in the Central Phoenix Area (Shake Shack, Hopdoddy, Chicago Hamburger Co Inc, BurgerFactory, Lenny's, Smashburger, In&Out, McDonalds, etcetcetc) that are CHEAPER price-wise, that have FRIENDLY employees & are CONSISTENT with the quality/preparation of their food. Had a good run with these guys initially, but all things truly do come to an end, things have changed for the worst here & at this point it's just time to move on. Throw your money away here if you wish, but as far as i'm concerned this place doesn't deserve another cent from me until they hire better people, lower their non-competitive prices, return to the level of consistency that they used to have & put more effort into the quality/preparation of their food. Visit at your own risk, or be one of the smart ones & skip this place altogether.",

I want to like this place, in fact, I do kind of love this place... However, the service is soooooo slow. Don't get me wrong, the staff is so friendly, helpful, and my order is always correct, but everything takes so long to get out.   Two separate examples: One time, we ordered two burgers and two milkshakes. It took about 15 minutes. We had totally forgot to order fries so I went up to order one side of fries and again... 15 minutes. Second example, we went to order 2 milkshakes around 7pm one night, and I understand that they are hand-spun, but it took 30 minutes!!!!!!!! I know there are a lot of people ahead of us, but c'mon. First come first serve works for some places, but I am not sure this is one of them.   They are a small LOCAL facility with great food and I really want to be a regular, but the long wait sometimes seems preventable. I will give them one more chance (or maybe more since their milkshakes are too hard to resist)...",

I have been here so many times and love the food, but the last couple of times have been terrible for customer service. Tonight I went out of my way to head over and stood I line for over 10 minutes. I was 2nd in line. They weren't that busy, but their process flow is TERRIBLE! The girl taking orders would take an order then walk around prepare the drinks and then do other stuff and disappear. The line just kept growing, meanwhile they're taking all the phone orders before attending to us in line here in the building . I waited and then a guy came up to the register to finish another phone order and the line kept growing. Just terrible, I'm all for attending to phone orders but you have to take care of people there in your building with some priority. I wish the service was better or that they actually had some process flow considering there were 8 employees here hat I counted so I don't think they were understaffed by any means. Just really disappointed",

    "text": "The Stand is a Phoenix, AZ exclusive burger joint that would be so successful if it expanded into such places as San Diego.  Having focused our culinary exploration to Diners, Drive-ins, and Dives and Man vs Food restaurants in Phoenix, for our last stop, we decided to try one of the local foodie joints that have not appeared on these shows.  After our positive culinary experience there, this place should be featured on one of these shows.  Think In n Out's simplicity and yummy burgers and fries and that's what you get at the stand.  As you enter the restaurant, you immediately notice the basic menu of hamburgers, tacos, various side items, and shakes.  Love a place that doesn't make the ordering process complicated.  By simplifying the choices, the focus is more on the food and once you experience the food The Stand prides itself on, you'll be a believer too.  There is indoor seating and outdoor seating, but with the blistering heat, sitting inside was a must.  There just isn't enough indoor seats to my liking.  The decor is simple as it's food choices.  There's a large Coca-Cola poster art piece, a decorative clock, and an old Coca-Cola cooler next to the registers.  The customer service by its employees are stellar.  The Stand is a burger place that also sells a few Mexican food selections.  If there are two things that you must order, order the Standard cheeseburger along with the extra priced grilled onions and jalapenos and the short rib taco.  The Standard cheeseburger is comprised of 2 house ground beef patties, lettuce, tomato, dill pickle, stand sauce, and with the added butter caramelized onions and grilled jalapenos, you'll want to order another one.  All of the ingredients meshed well together to make your taste buds happy.  The short rib taco is composed of braised short rib, pickled red cabbage, cotija y queso fresco, diced onion, and fresh cilantro.  Once again, you'll want to order another one.  The taco comes with hot sauce that isn't too spicy, but complements the taco really well.  We also ordered tortilla chips and fresh tasting guacamole, Mexican street corn, one of the best horchata drinks, and salted dulce de leche hand-spun shake.  The chips and guacamole is a good appetizer, my wife really enjoyed the corn, and the shake was thick, delicious goodness.  I asked one of the employees, who just so happened to formerly live in San Diego close to where we live, if the owners were planning to expand.  She said that she's been trying to convince the owners to open one in San Diego because this would flourish there.  We coincidently agreed that The Stand would be a great addition to what Pacific Beach has to offer.  I'm taking a stand to have The Stand open in San Diego or at least somewhere close so that I could satisfy my cravings.",

Also, it's fun that they have real Mexican coke, although they are frequently \"out\" of other authentic treats like horchata and Mexican corn.    The main thing that keeps us away is the service.  Waits are interminable, made even more annoying by the \"aren't we cool\" attitude of the servers.  Pro tip: if you're working in a fast food restaurant, you're there to get people their food, just like if you worked at McDonald's.

Even after a short car ride home, the burger was still great.  The onions and tomato were too thick and assertive for my taste, but the sandwich was meaty and delicious.  The \"special sauce\" provided flavor, without overwhelming.  This place is a good comparison for In & Out, where the burgers are also fantastic and the fries are subpar.  These fries had a nice subtle garlic pepper seasoning, but they were soggy and flaccid.  (Maybe that's only because of the time driving home.) The shake, however, was the biggest disappointment.  It was a below-average chocolate shake.  It had a malty flavor to it, and the straw looked like some giant breathing tube for asthmatics.  It collapsed on every sip. Add the fries and the shake to the high price tag, and you get a 2-star review... but the burger was good, and I'm holding out hope for a better experience next time.",

The guy at the drive-thru was friendly and helpful. I had the Standard burger with cheese and added on grilled jalapenos and bacon. I couldn't help but order the salted caramel - dulce de leche milkshake. I couldn't drive home fast enough to have a fat kid moment on the couch! This was easily one of the BEST BURGERS/SHAKES I've had in AZ. Do yourself a favor and check it out! If you're going to eat fast food, why not support a local, fresh made joint?",

And if you know such good food and are such an expert then why don't you have your own restaurant? ??  All you foodies out there could not even be a busboy never mind a dishwasher in a restaurant of any quality....your mom worked harder than you ever did and made really good food....because she had one thing on her mind while preparing your breakfast lunch or dinner....YOU ...your health and all the LOVE in the universe is why our moms cooked us such fine and tasty meals....the main chef at the stand is number one CLEAN...and we'll groomed the back lot and trash area are also clean Before I eat anything outside of my own kitchen I look at the facility the staffs hygiene and then if the back alley passes the test then we can go to step #2. So we can now take into consideration of any friends who may or may not have made a recommendation  Most of these people especially people in the biz are  Not even aware of real food.....so back to the STAND.... ITS like the Beatles stated while looking for a good meal in Lanka shire bedstye...\"love is all u need\" and the STAND HAS LOVE....BUT more to come",

Upon entering though, it was quite clean and welcoming! However, the place is ridiculously tiny, so the line was literally wrapping around the very limited places to sit. My friends and I arrived there around 11:40 and didn't get our order taken until after 12. We stood in line for over 20 minutes. I understand that it was lunch time on a weekday but what's the holdup with at least taking the order quickly so people don't have to awkwardly stand around. When I finally got up to the front to place my order, the cashier said \"one moment\" and then turned around and proceeded to package up a to-go order. She didn't turn around or acknowledge me for a good 5 or 10 minutes and just continued helping another customer. There were so many employees back there working on that one order. It all seemed quite chaotic. How about one person takes orders while another fills them?  Anyway, the food got to our table pretty quickly, which slightly made up for the awfully long wait. I got the chicken tacos and they were super messy with sauce. They tasted kind of plain though. Nothing spectacular. My friends both got burgers which looked pretty amazing so maybe that's where the specialty is.  All in all, I probably won't be going back unless it's for takeout.",

    "text": "Mixed feelings on The Stand right now. We have been loyal Stand customers since they opened. The burgers and fries are typically amazing and so are the shakes. I love the salted caramel!   My husband and I got off work late last Friday night and decided to pick up some food around 10pm (I think they close at 11pm). We got it home and it was  absolutely horrible. The fries were tiny little soggy, greasy pieces and the burgers did not taste fresh either. The whole meal was very unappetizing and at $20 for two burgers and fries majorly disappointing. We wrote it off as a fluke since it was late, although we have gotten delicious food there late at night many other occasions.  We went again today and although the burgers were close to normal, the fries were absolutely horrible again. They were all brown, greasy, over cooked, soggy, and barely edible.   We are small business owners ourselves and have been going to The Stand for about 2 years with no issues, so we were really trying to give it the benefit of the doubt. My husband called and let them know about our recent experiences. The employee who answered did not seem concerned. We asked if anything had changed about the fries, is there something we need to mention when we order to not get old, greasy fries? And return to the normally delicious, crispy, well seasoned ones? The employee said that they just have bad potatoes right now and there's nothing they can do to change the current quality of the fries. Bad potatoes?? For a place that prides itself on fresh ingredients I'm not understanding how a subpar quality of potato would be used for over a week. Moreover, I don't know how the quality of the potato could be affecting the amount of grease and lack of freshness of said fries.  Sadly, we will not be returning for awhile...",

    "text": "Perhaps typing this review while I'm anxiously awaiting lunch hour is not the best idea, I'm drooling on my keyboard thinking about the Stand goodness! I've been here a half-dozen times now, have brought friends with me and everyone has loved everything they've gotten. I'd say the burger is my favorite item, and if you're feeling like a serious indulgence go for the Salted Dulce de Leche Shake - its like heaven in a cup.   I've ordered and ate inside as well as gone through the drive-thru window there, and each time my experience has been great. They're making the meals to order, so obviously you're going to wait a minute that but that's better than being served a heat-lamp patty anyday! I love that the burgers as seasoned so well, amazing every time. The fries weren't really my thing, but I'm a picky fry eater so that's to be expected. The tacos were really good too, I've tried all of them and typically lean toward the chicken one as my favorite.   Give the stand a shot, you're going to be glad you did. Can't beat hot, fresh, made to order food for a reasonable price! :)",

Little flavor to the burger.  Taco was ok, but very salty...and I like salt.  Not the most organized place.  Employees were friendly, but seemed to be running around like a chicken with its head cut off.  Only about 6 people ahead of us and it still took nearly 10 minutes to order.  What's worse is that the menu doesn't really contain many more items that what I ordered so I'm not sure why they can't take orders quickly.",

We used to be able to get the tacos as well, which meant more variety. We were told we could go to the Scottsdale location for tacos, but this makes no sense when we live within walking distance of Indian School Rd.",

My favorite thing is the Mexican Corn... I have an obsession with it. It's perfect in every way with the onions, cilantro, cheese, mayo, lime deliciousness! My only wish is that it wasn't seasonal. ;) Everything is made fresh, which does mean a wait sometimes, especially when it's busy... but I tell you, you won't be disappointed if you've got the time! I also recommend the banana shake, and this coming from someone who hates bananas... It's delicious, creamy, and entirely refreshing! Burgers are flavorful and delicious... Fries delicious and also flavorful... The best horchata I've had in town, perfect balance of sugar and cinnamon. YUM!... Next on my list is the salted dulce de leche shake.  Oh, and GET THE STAND SAUCE!",

What really makes the Stand stand out is their employees. They are always the best personalities and so willing to be helpful and kind. Honestly, I have rolled through here likely over 100 times and have no ever had a bad experience. I love this place because the ingredients are fresh, the service is great, the place itself is unique and its close to home! :)",

After I sat down from ordering, they bring the food to you instead of just yelling out your order number. They also checked up on me twice after that to ask if there was anything else I needed. Overall this little burger joint was a nice surprise to my day and I recommend you give it a try!",

I work down the street and frequently grab food from the drive thru. The last lady at the drive thru seemed a little out of it, maybe she was new, or the AZ heat was getting to her (and it would be helpful to give napkins out at the drive-thru please!) Tacos are delicious, only a couple bucks, and pretty filling! Get the short rib tacos- my fav! The Standard burger always tastes fresh. They gladly make it by less as well, but the buns are pretty tasty. If you go in the evening or lunch time, when they are really busy don't expect to get out of there very quickly. I went after work to pick up food to go for my family and it took about 30-45 minutes for the food to come out. They could definitely use more space.",
