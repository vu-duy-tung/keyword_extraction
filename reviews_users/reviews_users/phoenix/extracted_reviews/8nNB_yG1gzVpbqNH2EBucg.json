    "text": "This southwestern themed restaurant has its appeals.  So I expected Mexican food with an American twist.  Most places that serve bread when your meal.  But Z'Tejas goes above and beyound and delivers cornbread.  I would have to say this is the best part of my meal.  There are even corn pieces in the piping hot bread in the cute iron pan.  It's fluffy and warm and the perfect way to start of the meal.  I almost got full just by eating the cornbread before my food came out.  I went during lunchtime and ordered the shrimp papaya enchiladas.  Shrimp, papaya, celery, onion and spices are wrapped in soft corn tortillas.  A black bean sauce covered the enchilada.  The meal also came with a corn rice and salad.  I barely tasted the papaya, but the shrimp turned out very well.  It was soft, but not chewy.  The black bean sauce was a bit dry and hardened the enchilada. There were vegetables added on top of the enchildas, but the bell peppers seemed too soggy and bland.  I believe the additional vegetables were superfluous and didn't add to the value of the dish. The salad was not special, but adding corn to the rice was a unique way to serve it.  It blended well with the cornbread that was served throughout the meal.   They do have a variety of food selections on the Happy Hour menu.  I think I'll go back and try some of the other dishes.  And mainly I would go back just for the cornbread alone.  :-) Overall, the food is average, what I typically expect from a chain restaurant.",

    "text": "We were in the neighborhood and decided to try Z'Tejas Southwestern Grill for lunch and were super glad we did as it was an excellent meal!  Ambiance & Decor.  - Very nicely decorated in, naturally, a Southwestern style. Although it is a fairly large room and was getting fairly busy by the time we left, it was not noisy at all. Very nice!  Food.  - The buttermilk corn bread is superb! Served in a small skillet with a side of butter it is airy and really, really good. As yummy as it is though, I do wish they would offer a jalapeno or green chili version.   - Based on our waitresses recommendation, I had the Diablo Pasta (spinach & red pepper linguine, spicy cream sauce, Cotija cheese, and jalapenos) - and I had to agree with her it was VERY good - and VERY rich.   - The better 1/2's Five-cheese Macaroni & Achiote Chicken (Jack, cheddar, Parmesan, Romano & bleu cheese, bacon gratin) was also delicious - and also pretty decadent.  Service.  - We got off to a bit of slow start when the hostess tried to sit us right next to the service area where at least 10 staff members were conducing business, but our request for a quieter table was readily & happily agreed to (but we should not have had to ask as it was not busy at when we got there). Our server while very friendly, and knowledgeable could have been a bit more attentive. A manager walked by to check on things - which I always take as a good sign!!  We are already looking forward to our next visit!",

He was super busy while the hostess went back to her podium to do absolutely nothing.  The food here is decent.  One dish I highly recommend is the diablo chicken.  If not for this dish, I probably wouldn't eat there as often though.  The corn bread is a nice touch and they're not stingy about bringing more.",

A basic margarita should have a good balance but this was just all sour and too bitter.  The trio of dips had very good queso, decent guacamole, and fair salsa.  The chips were plentiful though.  As for the main course, I had the salmon and it was utterly forgettable. Perhaps I should know better than to order fresh fish when you're not near the ocean, but it was just disappointing.

The tamari tuna is basically a sesame crusted seared tuna on a bed of rice and veggies with a great Chile sauce, think of it as an upscale jap-mex fusion.  The tuna itself was of a very high grade, sliced thinly and a dark ruby red. It was tender and lacked the sinuous bits cheaper ahi can have. The flavor was fresh and well accompanied by the tamari crusted sesame seeds.   I also had a small salad with their sesamee ginger dressing, which is so good that  I would order in cocktails if it were not frowned upon.   There was also a copious amount of corn bread so I could get my south western starch fix.",

    "text": "I went here yesterday for lunch. I had no idea what to expect from this place.  We ordered the chips and salsa. I also ordered the smoked duck tacos.   The server was nice and attentive to us. When we arrived, it was around 2pm so it was pretty empty.  Since this is a mexican restaurant, I was expecting different items on the menu. Well, it is a chain so it seems more of Mexican fusion than real Mexican food.   The chips and salsa came with three different types of salsa (one green one that had some avocado and two red ones [one was spicy and one was mild]). The salsa was good but nothing exceptionally. The chips were nicely crispy and they came in two colors.  The cornbread is buttery and filling. It is soft and I can taste little bits of corn in it. It comes with a side of butter but I didn't add butter to it because I felt like it had enough flavor. The cornbread comes out hot and fresh.  My smoked duck tacos were good. I like the side of slaw with it, it gave a fresh crisp to it. The marinade for the duck tacos were a little overpowering. They definitely did give a lot of duck sauce. The plating was nice, it was on a long rectangular plate. It was a little difficult to eat on such a skinny plate. The tortilla was nicely crisp and not too soft so it made it easier to eat. The sauce seems like a mayo-based sauce on top. It was good. I did wish they gave us more slaw on the side though. I like the duck meat although they had lots of sauce on it.  Parking is in the parking lot so parking is easy.  +Good cornbread -Not real mexican food, so if you want real mexican food, this is not the place to come too +Plating is nice +Service is attentive",

Server was pleasant but not trained to ensure customers concerns are addressed.   On the negative - EVERYTHING has chipotle flavor. Even Chipotles restaurant doesn't have this much Chipotle flavoring. I do not like the smoky flavor of chipotle. My husband doesn't mind it but this was even too much for him.   Guac - chipotle Tabasco (luckily we asked for no Tabasco so the guac wasn't ruined)  SW Caesar - Chipotle dressing. It wasn't listed as having it. We probably took 3 bites between us of the salad. Wasted $$. We did mention to the waiter that it was Chipotle dressing (which I'd previously told him I don't like so to keep anything Chipotle off the food). He said \"Oh really?\"  Didn't offer to replace or refund it either.   Street Tacos: asked for no chipotle sauce but it came with it anyway.   On a previous visit: Shrimp and Guac Tostada bites. Asked for no Chipotle sauce but it came with it still on it.   Red Chile and Mango Steak Salad- husband says it was great. No idea if it had chipotle sauce. If not - it's a minor miracle.   Seriously!! ENOUGH with chipotle mayo on every dang thing you serve. Diversify your flavors please. After 2 visits, we are done. Tired of paying for food we won't eat. (We didn't ask for items to be replaced. The first visit I was with clients and didn't want to fuss. Second visit I scraped it off the tacos because my husband was hungry and the waiter wasn't around. Second visit part 2 (the SW salad) I told the waiter and he shrugged it off,saying \"Its a Smoky flavor but not chipotle\". Chipotle IS smoky. Argh.   Could easily be a 4 star if they made orders right and tried other sauces on their food.   OH! The salsa is chipotle too.",

    "text": "katie and i went here on sunday before an ikea trip.  let me start off by saying we were seriously starving, i was so pumped to order my jerk chicken salad. we walk in and theres a 'bloody mary bar' and it looked absolutely disgusting. i alsmot lost my appetite by being greeted by that filthy mess of a germ bar.    i sat down while katie used the restroom and i ordered us water and myself a drink.   katie and i sat talking for a bit and i asked, \"are you going to get a drink?\" \"ya, if he ever comes back\" was her response  then i realized it had been 10 minutes before we saw our waiter again. finally, he came around and tried to make us order chips. we were so hungry we almost did but passed them up. we ordered our food, it was sooooo cold in there I couldn't order my salad, instead i opted for a breakfast dish. and let me just say breakfast is not their strong point.   another 15 or so minutes go by and we can't take it so we order chips.   then we notice everyone around us is eating corn bread. HEY WHERE'S OUR CORNBREAD?!?! we don't need chips and salsa, we're supposed to get cornbread!   so our waiter passes by us again so we ask/shout for cornbread.  then, not even lying, our food, chips and salsa, and cornbread come to the table all at once. so overwhelming  the chips and salsa were not good.  my food was not good- i ordered the breakfast enchilada.  if you eat here, stick to the jerk chicken salad(one of the best salads ive ever had) or the spicy chicken pasta which is perfectly spicy.  2 stars for service 2 stars for food on this trip(usually i would give it 4) 2 stars for sunday morning ambiance(dinner is the time to go here)",

I went there in a recommendation and got there at 6...ordered my food to go with these two girls who are hella young (warning sign).  so i sat and waited, playing my brick break on my blackberry.  I figured they would call me when the food was ready but no one called.  at 630 i got up to see whats going on...those girls in the front were like 'oh whats ur name, whats ur order,' and i believe my order was the only order they took.  they checked by the bar and was like 'oh here is ur order.'  of course i told them,dont you let ppl know their food is ready, and they were like 'oh ok'  idiots.  so i was upset of course and was about to pay when the gm came by and as like ' o my god were u waiting for this all this time?\"  i told him i came in to order and thought the girls will let me know when the order was ready, and didnt know ihad to go to the bar to pay for it, which is way odd.  so he was like hey the food is cold, i will heat it up and just take it, dont pay, its our fault.  so for that i give them a 5 star review from what would have been a 1 star review.",

My parents and I started with the cornbread which was hot, fresh, and delicious.  For our entrees we shared three things which were all wonderful.  The trout salad had delicious and crispy red trout on top of a delicious salad which had spicy walnuts in them.  We also had both the seafood and mushroom enchilada that were even better!  We don't eat shellfish out, and they were more than willing to take out the small amount of shellfish in it.    My parents also told the waiter it was my birthday coming up and they gave us a complimentary Ancho Fudge Pie with a birthday candle on top.  It was one of the most delicious deserts we ever had and seemed like a perfect cross between a lava cake and brownie.  Plus there is a PokeStop on the premises and as we were about ready to leave, I caught a Pikachu that I renamed Z'Tejachu.  After posting my experience on Facebook and sharing it with others, friends who have lived in the Phoenix and Austin areas also raved about their wonderful experiences at Z'Tejas.",

I'm not the best at checking my receipts when I get them as was the case this weekend. Today I came across the Z'Tejas receipt in my purse and started reading through it. I noticed there's a To-Go Service Charge and a To-Go Service Charge Tax!! I may be behind on the times but since when do you get charged to take food home? So do I get charged the same fee if I eat and the restaurant and take food home? It could be that I've been charged this before but didn't check the receipt. The mom and pop restaurants I frequent don't charge these fees. I won't be a regular customer of Z'Tejas any longer if I'm charged to order to go. I'm sure I can find some delicious nachos elsewhere.",

You can still order it and pay for it (the proceeds go to charity). Instead they bring some thick, cold corn chips with a brown sauce (tastes like a smoked chipolte pureed sauce, not a chunky, fresh Mexican food salsa). My friend and I tried it are not fans of the flavor profile. In the future I need to remember to ask them to not bother bringing this stuff to the table.  I had grilled ruby trout salad with seasoned walnuts, a small blob of feta cheese, mixed greens, and a flavorful dressing. The trout was very good and the overall salad was excellent. The price was $14 which I thought was about twice what it was worth. My friend had the mushroom enchiladas and stated that they were very good ($10).  Service was very good and the food arrived in a timely manner. There are both tables and booths and the noise level is not too bad (normal conversation can be carried on). The restaurant looked clean. It was a pretty typical look and feel for this chain.  Parking is plentiful and the disabled parking is close to the door for the mobility impaired.",

Their z  salad is so amazing for such a simple salad we love it with the red wine vinaigrette dressing! Other dishes we've enjoyed in the past are the Diablo chicken pasta, the chili rellano and the achiote chicken chopped salad! Our favorite margarita has become the paradise where they add extra shot of grand Marnier! Perfect place for a date night or for a fun afternoon happy hour! Love love love  Only downfall would be they seemed to up their prices on both the menu and happy hour... At least get back to good hh prices cause that's a huge draw!",

    "text": "It's close , usually pretty good , and fast . I have several favorites that I almost always get. The smoked chicken Chile Relleno is always good.  Popped in on a Saturday and  didn't know about the (new?) Brunch thing going on. Oh well, they had some interesting things, so I ordered a dish I had at Crackers Cafe on Elliott - that was super good there. Migas. Scrambled eggs, cheese, jalapeno or some kind of chilie, tortilla chips, all melted together.  Not.  Couldn't really discern where the eggs were, they had to be so dry... The whole thing was dry dry dry. Cheese? What cheese? I saw nor tasted a scrap of cheese.  I ended up eating the potatoes - that were good , but not what id pay 9.50 for.  Pass this weak version and head the Crackers for a delicious take  on it.  But one more thing that really bugged me... The waitress was super sweet  and pretty good ; I did get the wrong muffin delivered, but since I liked both kinds it wasn't that big a deal.  BUT, the cornbread- that used to be free- is now on a donation program: if you \"buy\" it for $3.00, all proceeds go to a local charity.  Alone, the meal would be big enough. I really wanted no cornbread.  BUT , she spent 30-45 seconds going over it, showing me the card explaining it (on table), And telling me if I couldn't eat it they'd box it up for me! Wow! Really felt pushed to get this $3.00  bread I did not want. I'm ashamed to admit I did order it. And she did box it. And I'll most likely throw is away.  Hey z tehas- show me card- let me read it, and decide on my own. No pressure! I think they may have a contest for who sells more... Sure felt like it.  So, fairly poor quality meal , and $3.00 wasted, while feeling first guilt, then frustration that I caved! Damn.  I won't be back for brunch again!!",

I was meeting a couple girlfriends here for happy hour before a meeting...as usual I was there on time and had to wait for them...I was quickly seated at a patio table and waited for what seemed about 10 minutes for a waiter...browsed their happy hour menu and wanted to go with the hard day margarita. However, the waiter suggested the chambord as it was the most popular...I agreed and it was good but on the smaller side for a margarita.  Went with the street tacos and catfish beignets as appetizers. The food was bland as if nothing was seasoned.   I would possibly go to a location closer to home for a drink but wouldn't eat there again unless I was maybe trying the entrees and hoping for better.",

Actually, both times service has been top-notch. Never a problem with service.  I again had the seafood enchiladas which are stuffed with tuna, salmon, spinach, and shrimp. This is really a delicious dish and full of flavor but the second time I had it, every other bite was cold (one hot, one cold, one hot, one cold) - weird. Also, some of the people I was with ordered steaks medium rare. Both came out well. Disappointing.  They do have this different version of a mojito made with pineapple-flavored rum and mint leaves, with brown sugar. It tastes like candy.",

    "text": "Tonight Z'Tejas let me down. It is unfortunate because I love the food here. I booked a party for six for a reservation at 7:30pm. We were seated right away in the upper level of the restaurant. Our waitress came over right away and took our drink orders. It all started out pretty well.  One of the members of our party had never been here before so he wanted to order three appetizers for us to all share. I recommended the Tejas Trio (queso, salsa and guacamole) and he told our waitress to pick two of her other favorites. Now I understand that he did leave this up to her discretion however, she chose two other items with shrimp and seafood in them. As a waitress I would have maybe considered that not everyone in the party would have liked seafood. I would have understood maybe one other appetizer with seafood but not both. Again, it was left to her discretion so I cannot say too much about this one.  I tried to get her attention two different times to order a margarita, both times she swiftly walked away, maybe I needed to be louder. All things I could have shook off if our meal would have been up to par as it usually is. I had recommended to the other members of our party to order the 21 day aged filet. We had previously had an amazing experience with this steak. Three of us decided to order this item. When they came out they were all New York strip and not filet. Not really that big of deal but when you are a expecting one cut of steak and you receive a different one, it is a little disappointing. My steak was supposed to be a filet topped with a peppercorn crust and topped with a mushroom sauce. It came out as a New York strip, topped with the peppercorn crust but no sauce whatsoever. My dining companions decided to keep the New York strips in lieu of returning them to re-fire filets. I decided to have a filet re-fired because my steak came out completely wrong. I reordered the new steak with the Gorgonzola butter instead of the peppercorn crust because it looked dry when it was brought out.  After waiting fifteen minutes, after all of my dining companions were finished eating, I received my new steak. It was a filet after all but it still came out with the peppercorn crust instead of the Gorgonzola butter. I just feel as though the entire night our waitress did not listen to anything we said. I really am not that picky but after getting all three of our steaks wrong, and getting mine wrong twice I was irritated. This was the place that my fiance and I had recommended to out of town guests and I feel as though it was a big let down tonight. I just do not think our waitress could handle a big party along with serving her other tables.  I still might be back because I know how good the food can be here. I just think we came on an off night. Too bad.",

We came in at 9:40 and the rest of our party came in at 9:54 to find that the kitchen is closed, despite the fact that the restaurant doesn't close until 10. They were extremely un polite about it and it was blatantly obvious that they were angry. As I work in a restaurant I know that although it might be inconvenient to have customers in so close to closing, it is their JOB to serve us. We had just finished my sisters high school graduation ceremony only to be greeted with rude service. Extremely disappointed, won't be returning.",

Food: Very good. Always good flavor with being gratuitously spicy. Mushroom enchiladas are my favorite meal. I've tasted EVERY appetizer and they are all very satisfying. Good portion size for an app, which makes the happy hour prices all the more attractive!   Drinks: Happy Hour Drink prices are quite high compared to other HH's. Otherwise, I guess they're pretty much in line. The Chambourd Frozen Margarita is delish!  Service: Never had a bad experience with the wait staff. Friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. Seem to be perfectly okay with their tables ordering off the HH menu (some servers don't like the small tabs and it's reflected in their performance). Like I said, not a problem here (IME).

And if you're a margarita lover then you must try the Fusion Frozen Margarita. They top it off with fruit infused Patron and it is refreshing and strong! Don't have more than 3! I would always recommend this location to any friends and family!",

The noise level of this place is ridiculous (it maybe the super high ceiling and seating in an open area) you would have to sit close or yell out your convo to one another. The food is average I find myself asking for extra sauce and the menu changes so much you can really keep a favorite unless you eat here every other day. My waitress Maria was a sweet heart. Her customer service made my experience at lot better.",

We walked in the door at 8:45 PM tonight (9/4/16) and were told by the employees at the door that the manager, Tom, had closed the restaurant already. The only problem is that Z'Tejas' website states that they are open until 9:00. Why couldn't we come in to get a quick bite and a quick drink? Also, if the restaurant was closed, why wasn't the door locked to let customers walking in know that the restaurant was closed. Not impressed and very disappointed with the manager at this location and we will not be back!!!",

    "text": "My rating is based on this first review... not on the second.  On my first visit to Z Tejas, I went at lunchtime with 2 guys from Boeing.  We had to sit at the bar since the restaurant was so crowded.  As I scanned the menu, the Grilled Green Chile Pork Enchiladas with green chile sauce and a tomato-avocado chopped salad caught my eye... and I'm glad it did.  I dont necessarily consider myself an 'enchilada' type of guy, but this dish provided me with the best I've ever tasted.  I recommend this dish, with no reservations.  Now for my second review.  My boss and I headed to Z Tejas today.  I figured that I'd mix it up and try something new.  Bad choice.  I was feeling a bit famished, so I ordered the more expensive menu item, which was Jack's Five-Cheese Macaroni Achiote.  The grilled chicken with bleu, Jack, cheddar, parmesan and romano cheeses and bacon gratin sounded like a complete winner.  Where to begin?  The dish incorporates real cheese, which I would normally find appetizing.  However, in this case, the entree was served piping hot, causing the cheese to string everywhere.  Kind of messy for a lunchtime meal.    So, I ate slow, in hopes that the threadlike curd would solidify some.  Well, it did, but it also left, what can only be depicted as an oily scramble, in the bottom of the bowl, due to separation.  Delectable!  Well, I decided to ease up on the 'roni, and move on to the chicken, which was served with skin on.  Visually, the skin looked crispy... but I realized my peepers were punked when I chewed up on some rubbery epidermis.  Swoop Says: skip the mac 'n cheeze, go for the whole enchilada!  In other news, the server at the bar was top notch.  She refilled my palmer again and again, until my bladder shouted: 'Uncle!'.  When you need some pampering, saddle up to the bar.

    "text": "Came here for a friend's birthday dinner. There were 12 of us and our waiter took great care of us in spite of the group size. We asked for separate checks and he didn't show any signs of an attitude at all. At the end, when our checks came some of us realized he had forgotten to charge us for our sodas. When we pointed it out to him, he brushed it off and said, \"If it's not on the bill, it won't be there at all. Don't worry about it!\" Now if only all our waiters can forget about charging us for alcoholic beverages...  As for the food, my favorite was the free corn bread. Fresh from the oven, piping hot, sweet, with whole kernels of corn baked in and served in a mini baking pan. I could have eaten an entire pan of it and called it a night. In hindsight, that's what I should have done. The birthday girl suggested I try the Grilled Miso Salmon since she knows I LOVE seafood, adding that it was \"pretty decent salmon considering we're in the middle of the desert.\" I'll also admit I'm not a big fan of Mexican food. Well, let's just say I'm sure there can be better salmon found in the middle of the desert than at Z'Tejas. The salmon was overcooked even though I asked for medium rare. The mashed potato cake on the side was just a lump of dry mashed potato that tasted like it was leftover and sitting in the fridge since last Thanksgiving. I definitely should have gone with a salad or Mexican dish.",

The ahi tuna appetizer, pulled pork nachos, and the cornbread were enough to change my life, both physically and emotionally. Yeah, that damn good. I won't write about the cornbread, because I want you to try it for yourself....write a Yelp review...and then give me credit. While you are at it, give my friend and fellow Yelper Sarah W. credit as well, because she is the one that turned me on to it.  Want a Mojito that will open your mind to a higher power? Try the Tropical Guava Mojito. Guava rum, X-rated fusion liqueur, monin mojito, mint, lime, soda and sprite. Yeah.   Like I said....happy hour on a friday was balls to the wall.  Get some.

    "text": "I just spoke with a manager this morning about an interesting experience last night at Z Tejas. The food was good. The queso dip would probably taste better and more authentic if it weren't made with American cheese. The guac was not salted. However, our entrees were good and I cleaned my plate. Love the free cornbread. Our waiter was very charismatic with us and we immediately thought, wow! What a great waiter! We thought that he was very nice and professional, even though our entrees arrived really fast, before our chips and dip (not even a big deal). That is when it seems like things took a turn for the worst.   Mid conversation, myself and a friend were very suddenly distracted by an extreme screaming match going on right next to us in the kitchen. It was so loud and clear. My first thought was, jeez I hope our waiter isn't being yelled at -- then, after a quick glance, I realized that the person who was yelling was actually our waiter! Our jaws dropped. The restaurant would get quiet as the screaming commenced. The employees nervously paced and darted their eyes around. Whoever was being yelled at in the kitchen seemed to try to defend themselves, but the waiter was so relentless. We sat there eating, talking, and very frequently stopping to listen to the drama.   I hate that I am leaving this review. However, the manager told me this morning that he would be emailing me. I haven't received that email yet. My friend and I who visited the restaurant work very hard, and it is not easy to just fork over $80 for a couple drinks, dinner and chips with dip... let alone listen to people be berated when we are just trying to chill! I hope to hear from management soon via email like promised. We want to come back because our entrees were fabulous, but last night was just downright unacceptable and unprofessional! We will go to another location if the Ray location is too problematic. Sad times.",

I have eaten at five star restaurants where the bill was over $600 and I was never treated with more kindness, respect, and hospitality then from Jeff the manager at Z'Tejas. Each staff member from the host to Don our waiter was friendly, quick to remove plates and fill up drinks. Jeff made the entire experience one that will keep us coming back!! As soon as he found out my wife and I were new to the restaurant, he did everything and anything to make sure our experience was a great one. We are truly blown away and walked out with how we felt like royalty from this establishment.  This is a legit review. I have never met any of the staff before tonight but felt like family.   Thanks Jeff, Dom and the entire Z'Tejas team!!!!",

    "text": "OK...so it's been 5 years.  I don't come here often, obviously!  We had a company lunch on this occasion.  The place was pretty full, and very loud.  Surprising how loud.  I ordered the steak burrito.  When it arrived it wasn't very hot.  Our orders were called in ahead of time, and we arrived punctually.  There were probably 15 of us, and they had the orders ready almost instantly.  Given the temperature I would say they cooked it well ahead.  My burrito must have been sitting around for (I would guess) 30 minutes to get that not-warm.  So how did it taste?  The flavor was not bad.  Pretty good, really.  The rice that came with it was seasoned very well, I thought.  But the steak in the burrito was a bit fatty and gristle-y.  I expect better quality meat at Chipotle or Cafe Rio, and I certainly expect better here!  All I can say is I'm glad I didn't pay the $13.50 for that burrito.  Yes, that's how much the lunch menu steak burrito cost!  If it was $7 I probably would bump to three stars.  Flavor was good, and temperature would probably have been fine if it wasn't a pre-order for a large group.  So I'll give them those.  Well, at least the benefit of the doubt on the temperature.  But the fat and gristle, plus the portion size (which was small) do not warrant a $13.50 price tag!  At that price the value just isn't there for what you get.  Service was good, especially considering the size of our group.  If there ever is a next time I will have to try something completely different.  For a burrito I could get one at Chipotle for $9 that is twice the size and almost as flavorful.",

    "text": "Four stars for amazing (but slightly pricey) food, with a bonus star for excellent customer service by manager Brad.    After a day of yard work, we decided we wanted a great dinner, but didn't feel like getting ready and going out...take out from Z'Tejas it is!  Z'Tejas is one of the few restaurants whose take out food is just as good as their restaurant food.  They pack many of the ingredients separately so that everything is fresh and the correct temperature.  The steak for the steak salad is packed separately, the tortilla strips and cheese are packed separately from the soup.   Even though it costs them more to pack everything, it definitely keeps the integrity and flavor of the food.   Starter - Bowl of chicken tortilla soup.  The soup has great flavor, but was mostly broth. The chicken that was included was delicious big chunks of white meat.  It came with a side of tortilla strips and cheese (didn't get the typical lime and avocado that usually comes with it - a little disappointing).   Entree 1 - Diablo Pasta (vegetarian version) - I love they have vegetarian options for many of their popular dishes.  The pasta was wonderfully creamy and spicy!   Entree 2 - Red Chile Mango Salad - This salad is SOO good.  It has delicious spicy walnuts, tangy blue cheese, tender and tasty grilled steak and mango dressing.  The flavors blend together so perfectly.  This is one of the meals that you crave!  Aside from their chicken artichoke stack (my other fave!), this is usually all I order here.  I just can't go and not experience the perfectly balanced flavor combo.    This visit - I was actually given the wrong dressing for my salad.  Instead of the wonderfully sweet mango dressing that accents the spicy and tangy ingredients...it was a warm sweet dressing with a heavy red onion flavor.  Not a  good match! :(   After trying to make due and tough it out I just couldn't do it.  The thing I love about this salad is the way the sweet dressing perfectly complements the other ingredients.  Hubby called them and spoke with manager Brad.  He immediately offered to remake my salad and comp the meal.  I would have been happy with either one (leaning toward re-making the salad as I REALLY wanted to experience the flavors, but didn't want hubby to have to drive back over there).  Comping the meal made up for the extra trip AND I got to enjoy my favorite salad    This is why Z'Tejas is one of our favorites!!!  Excellent food and EXCELLENT customer service.  We will be back!!!  Thanks Brad!",

They have enchiladas on the menu and right next to it a plain ol' burger!   All their salads are great! And, I'm not a girl who \"craves\" salads. If I'm going to crave anything it will be peppered french fries. But, man, I crave the z-Tejas Jerk Chicken Salad. Slightly spicy grilled jerk-spiced chicken (spicy and jerked is redundant) with roma tomatoes, feta cheese, tortilla strips (which I omit), salad and a spicy creamy dressing (which I always have them put on the side).  If the description sounds to spicy for you, then try the Pecan Crusted Chicken Spinach Salad as it is awesome as well.   Next time you are out on Ray Road or maybe coming back from Holiday shopping at Chandler Mall, stop by and try Z-Tejas. But for full disclosure, their service could be hit or miss. Ok- I've gotta run....I have a craving....",

We were seated promptly.  Z'Tejas carries the Republic of Tea drinks, so some of us ordered Pomegranite, I ordered the decaf Ginger Peach.  They served us a skillet cornbread (guess that is their specialty \"bread basket\" )  For lunch I had the cup of soup: Gumbo was on the chef's soup special today.  The broth was thick, the sausage was spicy, the chicken was tender and there was just enough rice to consider it a gumbo.  I also had the Z' salad which was a small mixed leaf lettuce with tomato, green and red bell pepper, parmesean cheese and their own string like crutons.  I got the ginger vinegrette on the side.  It was just enough to fill me up, but not make me unbutton my pants. LOL.  The rest of the group had variations of enchiladas: mushroom, chicken and cheese.  The lunch plate size is very good, and included rice and choice of beans.  I am glad restaurants are finally sizing DOWN the portions!  I am tired of doggy-bags that sit in the fridge only to be tossed out.",

My faves include: catfish tacos, Jerk Chicken salad, Diablo Pasta, Wild Mushroom enchiladas, Mac & Cheese w/o bacon, the trout, seriously, the list could go on and on.  My mouth is watering.

Ada G. is addicted to their Chambord Margaritas and recreates them at home for us too.  As for their other food.  I've had a salad I liked and some apps were good but I've generally been a little disappointed with the rest.  My friend B's husband used to be a bartender at Scottsdale so once upon a time, we put in many Friday nights at the bar, sampling the wares.  Nowadays I just go for a \"normal\" happy hour and I'm not having to drive back to her house Sunday afternoon to get my car.  I'd have to say it's a much kinder, gentler approach.  Try them for happy hour.  Sit on the patio, enjoy the weather (unless it's summer) and have a margarita and some tostada bites.  I think you'll enjoy it.",

We met at 6 pm on a Saturday night, and while clearly busy, it only took them 10 minutes to seat us.  The restaurant was nicely laid out, plenty of room between tables, and I didn't feel like I was crammed in a corner.  The noise level was perfect too, something that is missing from so many places.  Our server was friendly and quick, and answered menu questions with suggestions and good information. I ended up ordering the 5 Cheese Macaroni & Cheese, and my date got the El Diablo chicken.  Both were pasta dishes, but very different.  The mac & cheese was gooey and tasty, and very filling - no appetizer and I could not finish my plate.  I really wanted to - the bacon on the top was the perfect touch.  My date's chicken and pasta was spicy, but not overwhelming - subtle flavors playing out nicely together.   The portions were large enough that I couldn't even think about dessert, and was so glad we passed on an appetizer.  Overall it was a great meal, and I would have given them 5 stars, if it wasn't a chain restaurant.",

We happened to meet up at the Chandler location.  Everyone obsesses about the cornbread, but I don't love cornbread.  That's okay because the dip trio is amazing - guacamole, queso, and salsa.  The chicken enchiladas are very popular here, and it is probably because the chicken is smoked/roasted beforehand, so it has a nice flavor.  I ordered a salmon salad, and I loved it.  I normally don't like mixed greens, but I highly recommend it.  It was abnormally spicy for a spicy salad though.  It's so interesting because I feel like Z'Tejas is almost like a Valley version of Cafe Poca Cosa (Tucson); it has the same kind of vibe without all the hype.  Sort of a ritzy Southwestern take on Mexican food.  I am a fan, but the service was abnormally slow and confused when I went there.",

I forgot the servers name but he was a tall younger man with long hair. He did have a red pocket square and looked like the only one with one on (very nice touch to the plain black uniforms by the way) My fiance and I are not really big Margarita drinkers but he recommended the chambord blended margarita and it was ammaaziinnggg. We had the queso appetizer which was delicious! I ordered the shrimp and chicken diablo pasta (by our servers recommendation again)  and the plate was prepared perfectly! I usually go to oreganos for this similar plate but ztejas blows them out of the water! The place and bathrooms looked very clean also. Everything from the food to the service and the cleanliness was on point! I really wish i rememberd the servers name so he could receive  acknowledgement for his great service. We will be returning!!",

    "text": "Ya know, I almost thought about giving Z-Tejas five stars just for having a separate, gluten-free menu, but I just couldn't bring myself to do it because the service was way below what I expect when I eat out.  We, a party of five (including my parents, who were visiting from Scotland), were initially seated at a really cramped table when several booths were open. Remedied this by asking to be moved to one of them. In addition, we didn't receive a kids' menu until we had waited around for about 20 mins. So, picture this, I have a hyper kid on my hands because his blood sugar levels are low and he's ready to chew his own arm off as well as those of everyone else surrouding him. Great... I will say that a very large party (around 20 people) was seated nearby and our server was one of many attending to their every need.  Our server had an excuse; he was new to the establishment and still in training. He was very cordial and was trying his best to deal with my gluten-free requirements. Turns out he wasn't given any training on the menu, with which he was very unfamiliar. Great...way to instill confidence that I'm not going to have a gluten-related \"episode.\" Let me be clear, I don't blame him for this whatsoever. My hat goes off to him for trying. What got me was the dirty look I received from one of the female servers...WTF! What did I ever do to her. Message to her: You're in the wrong line of work, lady. Try collections or repossessions. I almost handed her back my gluten-free steak and vegs. My give up...  The food, when it did finally arrive, was good, albeit a little bland in my case. Why the heck people think gluten-free food has to taste bland is beyond me. I wish Gordon Ramsay would come in and rescue kitchens from their gluten-free nightmares. My parents both enjoyed their meals; they ordered the filet mignon with mashed potatoes and green beans. My son enjoyed his cheeseburger, but then what kid doesn't? And, my husband enjoyed his seared ahi tuna steak, but felt the portion size was a little on the small side (he's a big guy).   Next time, I'll try the chambord margarita. I don't think I can go wrong with that -- at least it's alleged to taste good and it's gluten-free. =) I will, however, be checking out the restaurant in Tempe and not coming back to the one in Chandler.",

I had the potato hash and eggs which was ok but it seemed like it needed something more flavor wise. Maybe a little more sauce on top would have made it better. Also, since I was sick, I ordered the tortilla soup. It was a thick soup and I actually prefer brothier tortilla soups. Wasn't bad though. As always, the cornbread was phenomenal. I also had a red sangria and it was delicious and refreshing. My companion said that she loved her burger and fries. I still love Z Tejas but I will probably just go for dinner there from here on out since that is where they really shine.",

    "text": "After about a year of the guys at work insisting that I go, I finally went.   Foremost, our waitress was really nice. A great waiter/waitress can usually make or break a restaurant experience. She did a great job taking care of us. Although the sun was shinning in my eyes half of the time, the environment was still pleasant. The music was just loud enough to hear but not so loud to have to talk over it and the dining area was roomy. The food wasn't the best food I've ever tasted but it was still worth the experience.   Cornbread - Amazing. You'll find little pieces of corn while you eat. It's literally corn and breading. It's the way cornbread should be. Bottomless basket of chips and three salsas - The chips were pretty good and while the salsas had a lot of flavor to offer my mouth they just weren't as great as I was hoping. Wild mushroom enchiladas - Delicious and different but it could have been served a little hotter. Not spicier, hotter as in heat. Baked seafood enchiladas - My boyfriend's entree. He enjoyed it and was most thrilled about the barbequed shrimp the enchiladas contained. Tropical Guava Mojito - Very sweet but still sooo good. Stoli Blueberi Cosmo - Amazing. I could go back just for the Stoli Blueberi Cosmos and cornbread and leave happy. Best drink of the evening. Prairie Berry Lemonade - Kamikaze in disguise. If you don't like fruit pulp I don't recommend this. There is lemon pulp in this drink. It's served with floating blueberries also. I loved it.   Do I plan to go back? Very likely. If not for the food, definitely for the cornbread and drinks.",

    "text": "Went to Z Tejas in Chandler Arizona last evening for the specific purpose of Taco Tuesday promotion for The Rockin taco festival in downtown Chandler this coming weekend. The promotion was to have tickets for sale 2 for $10, all day long. Once seated and finally wait staff came to our table after a 10-minute wait, we ordered one of the food and drink specials, and I asked about tickets. I was told that they were sold out. This was at 5:30 p.m. . And was told that another location had tickets. Seeing as how there are no other locations in the East Valley I was confused. The taco and drink promotion was for two tacos and a margarita for $12. Which was kind of a joke. The margarita was as small as a cocktail glass, and two small street tacos. The margarita was nasty, but the tacos were good even though there was only two bites to each one. The manager walked by checking on tables and asked if everything was fine. We said the tacos were good and said the reason we came by was for taco Tuesday and to purchase tickets. At that point he told me that they were out of the tickets but the Tatum and Shea location in North Scottsdale had them. The promotion clearly stated Chandler location only. So I don't understand why they would not have them, but Tatum and Shea location does. Z'Tejas completely dropped the ball on this,. I left us with the feeling like this was a \"come-on\", to get people in to the restaurant. I have no need to ever go there again for taco Tuesday or any other meal.",

There were empty tables when we arrived. Management at this location has hit rock bottom.  Obviously they have staffing issues. And the Sunday Brunch has not been worth the money since last Easter when they modified the menu.  They don't deserve the one star but it is the Yelp minimum.  Do yourself a favor, stay away!

We got there early and there was plenty of parking, when we left, the place was getting their lunch time rush. The inside was nice and open and decorated nicely which made for a pleasant visit.  We were seated immediately and our waiter started out with the drinks.  We let the waiter know that we were in a rush because we had to catch a plane, this is typically a good test of the urgency the waiter can relay back to the kitchen, which they nailed, great teamwork guys..  They serve some corn bread with butter which was warm and fresh and had a little bit of sweetness.    I ordered the steak burrito which was covered in sauce.  The steak was nice and juicy and they were ample size cuts.  The burrito had a nice little spice to it and came with some rice on the plate.   The only thing I think needs a little change is the salsa and chips.  None of the three salsa's were particularly spicy and didn't really stand out from one another even though they were different styles.",

    "text": "This restaurant has recently gotten new owners. A few things have changed but the food is still delicious as ever. For example, they used to give out cornbread as part of the meal. Now it is $3, which is donated to charity. I think the reason they did it this way is because no one is going to throw a fit over money going to a charity. But I'm sure they will eventually just start charging for it without donating. Basically, they are cutting down costs but doing it in a \"nice\" way. Other than that, I always love the atmosphere, and there isn't an item on the menu that I don't like. The waiters and waitresses are usually very nice and attending. Even when the place is busy, the food comes out pretty quick. The prices are to be as expected for a nicer restaurant. If you're looking for a unique southwestern dining experience, Z-Tejas is the place!",

I really enjoyed their chambord margaritas, which were on happy hour special. The table side guacamole was ok, not the best that I have had. Everyone was happy with their main dishes, which vary from Mexican, or tex-mex inspired.   The service was ok, my parents commented that they have had some pretty awesome servers at this location, however our server seemed a little overwhelmed, she would run to the table, as us one thing, leave and come back and ask again. It took my dad three attempts to order a beer.   I give 3 stars because the service was average and the food was good! I'll give it another try in the future though.",

Service -Amazing from being greeted at the door to our amazing server Missy.  She is amazing at what she does.  So amazing that I am writting this review a month later after finding my receipt.  She had amazing recommendations and I ran with them, every item she recommended what amazing.  It obvious she's knowledgeable about the menu and knows how to ask the right questions to provide the perfect recommendation.  One of the best experiences I have had with a server and I eat out tons.  Food -Seasoned well, perfect amount of spice to it. -Looked good and came out hot instead of looking like it had been under a heat lamp and coming out with the \"I've been sitting under a heat lamp look\"   My Marg was on point!   Atmosphere -Busy, a bit loud but not unbearable.  It was what was to be expected during Happy Hour. -Clean, tables being bused in a timely manner -Clean Restrooms.  Overall I will make sure not to wait so long to come visit again.  I hope to have the pleasure of being served by Missy again as well.",

Reason I was there was because I had heard great things about this place, however, I as not impressed.   Food wasn't too flavorful, and being that it's Mexican food, you'd expect it to be nothing but flavor. I don't know, maybe Im just used to Mexican food being flavorful and juicy. There food was neither.   Service was good, however. Hence the 3 stars.",

The only thing they could tell us is it's hot out they come in during the hot temps, we are sitting by the bar that draws them to that area. So the manager suggest moving us to another table away from the bar. All our meal plates, our appetizers, our drinks, utensils etc.   We switch tables in the dinning room and encounter the same problem left and right nats. So bad I can feel them hitting my hand every time I bat them away.   All they did was offer their apologies, nice but at that point no one said anything to us about discounting our meal. Or come and try us again when we are not infested with nats!   Funny you can't even go on their website for customer service feed back.  Either way it's sad to think I even finished my meal and paid, full well knowing that there are other restaurants that do not have that problem and it's the same temp for them as it is for Zejtas.  Please know if I could place this feedback on their page I would!!!! Stay clear of Zetjas chandler!",

The atmosphere is casual but the restaurant itself is beautiful!   I have been dieting so my mom and I split the chicken fajitas with corn tortillas. It was very good. They have a roasted salsa that's delicious and the guacamole was very good. Great portion to share.   The service was excellent from start to finish! The hostess was very friendly and went over specials and even recommended dishes when we sat down. The server answered all our questions and was very prompt on refills and checking in with us. The manager also ran our food out to us and checked back to make sure everything was great.   Overall great experience with food and service. Will be back when I'm in town. Thanks!",

We've been here during the week and weekend and again service is consistent.  I say order the table side guacamole and the chamboard (adults only) to start.  Then go with the enchiladas (seafood or mushroom) or the steak burrito (red). Street taco are also a great way to go, now we have not had the desserts so I can't give you any help there.",

Went to Z'Tejas and was pretty disappointed with our first 10 minute experience.  Our table was dirty, bread plate was dirty and no one showed up to place a drink order for almost 10 minutes. So, we walked out.   I mentioned what happened to the hostess and the manager, Chris walked out after us.  We told him what happened. He apologized and asked if we would come back in.  We were set at a clean table and offered drinks right away. And, of course their amazing cornbread!  Next came queso and dip that we didn't order. Our food was brought our right away and was delicious. My husband had the smothered burrito which he loved. I had An enchilada that was outstanding.   Chris would not let us pay our bill and was so apologetic. We definitely never expected to be comp'd. Being in a service industry myself, i appreciate that sometimes things happen. It is the manager and staff's job to rectify the situation. Which they did VERY well.  Thank you Chris and the Z'Tejas staff for turning a bad experience into a fabulous one!   We had an amazing lunch!!!!",

I was disappointed to find that my appetitizer dish in addition to the other plates on the table were dirty.  I proceeded to retrieve three other plates from another table only to find that they too were dirty.   l spoke to the general manager who was very professional about the matter and ensured me that he was working with the staff to correct the issue. The waffles are nothing special but the shrimp tostadas are delicious. So if you can stand possibly finding leftover food on your dishes give this restaurant a try.  By the way I only rated this restaurant a 3 because of the awesome server we had Tammy and the shrimp tostadas.",

The chamboard margaritas are amazing!   However.....we ordered: 1) dumplings.  My son loves dumplings but these were dry and chunky.  He took one bite and spit it out.  And he loves dumplings!  Well $10 in the toilet! 2) fajitas.   - beans - too spicy for me and the rest of the crew could not eat either.  But if you like spicy - awesome! - chicken - biggest high and low.  Flavor wise a wonderful chipotle type nacho spice....yum.....except it was so dry we quit after a couple of bites trying to choke down the bites!   - salsa - none so make sure you ask. - rice and mix was nice but no flavor. - came with cheese (I think I asked for extra but don't think I got it). - came with shredded lettuce - loved that they packed it separately so it didn't get warm - cudose! End: May Try again but in house.",

Tammy was our server and she is timely, efficient, polite, attentive, and knowledgeable of the food and drink menu. She is able to make recommendations.  I had the veggies instead of chips for the guacamole.  You can make a meal of that alone.  Fresh, cucumbers, celery and carrots.  The manager came out shortly after the first bowl of veggies and said they didn't peel them and replaced them before we even had a chance to notice.  They even pull the threads off the celery like I do.  (I thought I was the only one) we had the special.  A chicken pot pie with Cajun and green chili cream sauce.  They precooked the chunks of potato before baking them in the pie.  The Zucchini, carrots and other veggies were still crispy like I like.  We ordered a side of cornbread that must have an extra cup of sugar in it with corn kernels.  They do NOT offer a veteran's discount.",

    "text": "I ordered off of UberEATS and the food was extremely bland - which was rather surprising. The only flavoring that came through on the steak tacos was the raw onion. The steak itself was gray and sad. Also, the dish said it comes with Southwestern rice and black beans - nope, they lied. Just four tacos, for $16.60. $4.15 a taco. I wish I knew, you can get much better street tacos for $1.50 each right down the street from me. I thought I'd give Z'Tejas a try though, and what a let down. Additionally the corn bread is mediocre - tastes like corn bread you'd get premade from a local grocery store that's been under a heat lamp since the morning.  My boyfriend got the Green Chile Barbacoa enchiladas. In his words, \"I feel like I'm eating a TV dinner.\" All of the food was disappointing, and now I know that I won't be paying a visit in person or order from them again.",

I don't typically order all veggie dishes, but with the portos it was hearty enough...too bad I couldn't substitute ALL Porto's, but I understand as they can be pricey (I did ask). They were SOOO BUSY! Way to be on top of things and have a ton of wait staff to help others, I really like seeing that team work.

First off, we go to the hostess, ask for a table for two, and they say it'll be a 20 minute wait and they'll text us when the table is ready. Cool, no problem. We walk around Casa Paloma for a while and then 25 minutes pass without hearing anything. We head back to Z Tejas only to see a large party in front us walking in and immediately being seated. We ask the hostess when we could expect to be seated and lo and behold they find a table for us right away. Once we sit down, I look at the menu and see that the cornbread, which has always been free in the past, now costs $3. Not a big deal but still a bit chintzy in my opinion. We ask the waiter when the change happened and he says \"December 1st. Were you guys planning on just snacking on cornbread and hanging out?\" The rudeness of this statement and the implication that accompanies it stuns me. Believe it or not, just because I'm younger doesn't mean I don't plan on spending money for a decent dinner. So at this point we walk out and I make sure to tell the hostess why we were leaving and ask her to pass the message along to the manager. I will never come back and I will be sure to tell my friends and family not to either.",

To the management team: do whatever you have to do to fix the water situation.  You'll make the cost back on just my visits alone and I am sure others have the same problem.  Lastly, do you really clean the lettuce with that stuff?  To the chef: until this is fixed, use bottled in the kitchen, it's worth it.  One last note, the water taste has been a consistent issue, I've just always ignored it because we like the food so much and can avoid it with tea or coke.  This last time...it was so bad that it crossed the line and required me to adjust my review.",

    "text": "Awful.  Just awful.  I've been to Z'Tejas 5-10x in southern California.  This was my 1st experience at this particular one in Arizona.  We came on 12/23 with a decent size party, about 10 with a few kids.  Waiter was not nice or friendly, not in the Xmas spirit let's say, but that didn't really annoy me too much.  We had a male and female waiter, I won't use their names as I don't want anyone to get in trouble/lose a job/or whatever, and they got multiple orders wrong, despite being corrected during the ordering process.  Example, kids meal, chicken strips with sweet potato fries.   Waiter: \"ok, cheeseburger with fries?\" \"No, chicken strips with sweet potato fries\" \"OK\"  15 minutes later, cheeseburger with regular fries show up. This happened with quite a few dishes.  Then he disappeared for the remainder of the meal.  I think he really hated our table because he kept getting stuff wrong and we continually sent stuff back (black stuff floating in milk, wrong orders, etc.).  He served other tables around us, but not ours.  Maybe he was overworked and had a bunch of other tables, but whatever.  Waitress wasn't much better, but still made errors.  Now, the food.  Like I've said before, I've been to Z'Tejas multiple times.  The food here was so bad.  Steak burrito on rice.  Steak was good, rice was horrible, needed to be cooked at least another 10 minutes.  Overall best thing that we ate.  Chicken salad.  Just awful.  horrible presentation, dry chicken, probably the wrong dressing was brought out, etc.  No redeeming qualities here.  Go to mcdonalds and get a better salad or just go to your trashcan and get a better salad.  Chicken Fingers Kids meal.  Worst chicken fingers I've ever had in my life.  How do you screw up chicken fingers?  It was like eating chicken flavored chalk.  Overcooked, under seasoned.  Tostada appetizer or whatever it was, undercooked shrimp aka grey shrimp, had to send it back.  Congratulations Z'Tejas, you found food I wouldn't eat for free.",

I think I've had better Mexican in Maine than Arizona so far, it is distressing.  If any of you native Phoenicians (is that how you say it?) out there are reading this review, please drop me a line and PLEASE tell me how to get REAL Mexican food!  Anyhows, this place was very pleasant, I stopped in here late for a drink at the bar, checked their menu and saw the usual American interpretations of Mexican food.  So I can't really rate the food here, but it sure as heck doesn't look like good Mexican to me.  The margarita was their best (shouldn't you get a great one in the Phoenix area?  I think you should) on their drinks menu, made with Cuervo 1800 tequila.  I realized after a few sips that I prefer Sauza Hornitos, but it was passable.  Two inebriated ladies sitting next to us at the bar made the experience more enjoyable!",

Navajo taco special consisted of a few shrimp plopped into a mush of rice and cold black beans, all piled atop a cold and greasy slab of Indian fry bread. Hamburger ordered medium-well arrived rare.

Definitely way better choices in the area",

He gave us exemplary customer service with his energy, passion and knowledge of the food and drinks! The atmosphere was lovely for a late romantic dinner with dimmed lights and a low-volume sophisticated demeanor. The food was fantastic! We started with chips and salsa, then a bowl of tortilla soup and then the baked seafood enchilada which Trevor happily recommended! It was so yummy. You have to try the baked seafood enchilada! They even split it on two plates for us and we were very pleasantly surprised!I had the chambord margarita with a sugar rim and it was phenomenal--good amount of alcohol! My boyfriend had the Z Tejas mule, and he's pretty picky about mules--he loved it!  Great service, great food, great drinks and good prices! We'll be back soon!!!",

Z'Tejas, not so much.  We went for lunch and were seated immediately.  The place we had originally planned on going had a line out the door.    This is a huge restaurant and beautifully appointed.  Servers were all nice and did a good job.  It's a little dark in here.  It was lunch and had numerous windows but unfortunately we were not seated near them. I had trouble reading the menu.  The corn bread and butter starter is a nice touch.  Everyone likes a freebie.  It just wasn't that tasty.  Nothing special.  I went with a dish off their \"seasonal\" menu and it did not disappoint.  That being said, it wasn't overly special either.  The beans and rice were okay also but again, nothing special.  The bill came quickly and we were out the door in less than 45 minutes.  Very efficient.  Not the best southwestern food I've had but it's decent.  Don't expect much.",

I didn't bother telling her, as I didn't want a whole different meal by then.   Restaurant was not very busy.

Not sure what would have happened if we hadn't said anything but they eventually sat use once we pointed out how long we'd been waiting, the fact that we had a reservation, and that there were plenty of open tables... Our waiter had a bit of a smart mouth but at least our food came pretty quickly. Just wish it was as good as it was when I used to visit this location.

This was my first to-go order and one that I can foresee the restaurant and Uber blaming each other for the mishap. I ordered the Z burger, chicken tacos, a smothered burrito,  and a shrimp appetizer. The order was delivered quickly especially on a Friday night. Yet, I didn't receive the smothered burrito leaving one of my family members without dinner. Then I bit into the chicken tacos and chomped on a bone. Major disappointment for my first time as a customer. I did like the shrimp app that was flavorful. I was not impressed with the chicken tacos despite the \"bone happenstance.\"  It was dry and lacked seasoning. My biggest let down was their prices. Items are over priced for the quality. Not impressed. Not authentic. Not detail oriented.  Certainly not recommended to my fellow Yelpers, and overpriced.",

Ally came to check on us often not too much and not too little. She was quick at taking our orders and getting them right the first time(i know it also involves the cook). We started with a trio appetizer, and the guacamole was lacking seasonings, the red salsa was good with a perfect spice to it, and the Chile con queso was not impressive. My mom and I had tacos she had carne asada and I had shrimp. The proteins were really tasty and seasoned just right, but the tortillas were hard on the edges and cold. That part was unappetizing so I ended up eating two of my tacos with no tortilla which is crummy because I ordered tacos. They also brought out cornbread and that cornbread was delicious I could have ate 10 of those, but of course didn't. For sides my mom had rice and it was okay not the best a little dry. I had black beans and the Z salad. Beans were good again a little something was missing. Now the salad was delicious! It was fresh, colorful and it was refreshing eating it. For drinks we had a tea and a lemonade the lemonade did not taste homemade, but I really enjoyed I had about 2 cups of it and that's unlike me. I tend to just drink water with my meals.  The restaurant was clean, staff was amazing, but the food was not so great considering there pricing I expected more. I think I would be willing to go back just because of the staff, but we will see.",

Waited an extra 10-15 minutes - fortunately our clients came in a bit later so they didn't wait as long.   The service was on the slow side. Looking around there weren't that many tables, but still took about an hour to get our main entrees. The table side guac was good but everything else seemed mediocre if not worse. The server got 2/8 orders wrong (I.e forgetting to substitute beans for rice or removing bell peppers). For me, I ordered the crispy salmon and noticed it was raw quarter through the food. Definitely felt the salmon swim upstream afterward. Bleh.   First time at ztejas, probably last time.",

When we walked in, there was no wait and were seated right away. The service was a bit slow at times but our waitress was very pleasant. We tried two different margaritas each and they were all pretty tasty.  As for the food, the chips and salsa were unimpressive for being house made salsas and I wish that they only carried the blue corn tortilla chips (unfortunately there were only 3 in the entire bowl...). The cornbread that they serve was surprisingly delicious. I'm very familiar and very particular with my southern styled food. And this cornbread did not even need the butter that they brought out.  As for the main dishes, he ordered the mushroom enchiladas and I the santa fe chicken enchiladas. He said his was good being paired with sauteed vegetables and black beans. I believed him due to the fact that he did not leave much on his plate! :) As for mine, it was okay. The green chile rice they served alongside the enchiladas was not good at all but the vegetables were okay. The chicken itself was flavorful and had an okay spice level. But the 'bbq' they place ontop in the form of a \"Z\" kind of threw it off.  Overall, it was decent for the price point and the margaritas were pretty tasty. So I cannot think why I would not be back. However, I cannot think this would be my first choice for anything besides good margaritas.",

We got cornbread, chips and salsa, Diablo pasta with shrimp and the New York strip.  My husband seemed to enjoy the cornbread, I think he was hungry.  The chips and salsa were chips and salsa. The steak was cooked perfectly at medium rare but needed a lot of salt. My first bite of my Diablo pasta I made a face because it was something about the flavor. It was Rosemary. I don't like Rosemary. The pasta was not overcooked it would've been more enjoyable if I like the flavor.   So we discussed if we would ever come back and probably not. But if we did we would probably order something else.   Our waiter was friendly!  It was noisy but not too bad. I could still hear my husband talking across  table.  So we gave it a shot and onto the next.",

We were not aware that they had to share the juice. I asked for a cheeseburger well done, no bacon and it was medium well with bacon. I know I probably won't get sick if I eat pink meat, but that was not what I ordered. One thing my friend did like was the jalapeno mayonnaise.

The hosts at the front were very friendly, the one who walked me to my table actually stayed and made conversation for a couple minutes which hardly ever happens anymore.  My actual server was very friendly too.  I was very happy to see that they had a Build Your Own bar where you could pick from a Bloody Mary, Mimosa, Screwdriver and one other drink I can't remember and it was incredibly cheap!  Only $4 for my Bloody Mary!  They had a wide variety of choices too as far as juices, fruits, vegetables, seasonings, sauces, it was hard to decide!  For my actual entree I ordered the Hickory Burger which has barbecue sauce, chopped onions, bacon, jalapeno mayonnaise and a couple different cheeses.  It was delicious!  Kind of a mess to eat but worth every splatter you get on your face and shirt.  I just wouldn't recommend ordering it if you're with someone you're trying to look dignified in front of... The fries were great too.  Nice and crispy on the outside but soft on the inside.  I was definitely happy with my decision to switch up my lunchtime location and I will for sure be coming back in the future.",

Honestly, it's been years since I've felt like a customer as at this point in my living I'm a part of the Z'Tejas family. Every time I'm in I'm reminded from the time I walk in the door that I'm family based on seeing my ChamFruzion being prepared. The staff here over the years has been phenomenal. To this day even former Z'Tejas members that have transitioned away from the restaurant keep in contact and still refer to me as the One and Only ChamFruzion Nick. A True testament to leadership on creating a culture that's appreciated by just the customers, but employees as well! I appreciate you Z!  Nicholas SupperClub of Phoenix President",

    "text": "Do not listen to anyone who doesn't rate Z Tejas 5 stars, I've never been more impressed with a chain restaurant.   The food was phenomenal. Free cornbread and sweet butter!? What's not to love. Can't eat Mexican without free chips and salsa? Don't worry they have that too! My girl had a skinny marg x2 and I stuck with a Diet Pepsi because I was crushing cornbread. My fish tacos were cooked to perfection, her smothered burrito had incredible flavor and I must say the portions were right on as well. Not too much but left feeling full.   The service is what really puts them over the top, our server was Derek, and he was spectacular. Very attentive and was genuinely happy to help and focused on us. The manager even came by and didn't just check on us but offered suggestions, and was happy to refill our drinks as well. Every one there was happy you came in and it came through in every aspect. If you're looking for cheap Mexican and cheap service don't go to Z'Tejas, but if you want an authentic tex mex where the passions comes through in you're whole experience, GO, NOW!",

My friend ordered a medium cooked center cut filet that came out rare. She asked them to cook it more and instead of putting it back on the grill or giving her a new one, they microwaved it! The server told us they did!!! They said they couldn't put it back on the grill for health reasons.  But y'all... we knew... that steak came back grey!! It was so nasty. Luckily they removed it from the bill.... but it doesn't matter, we won't be back.  And in response to the manager - we were in late night, May 11th. It was our Mother's Day dinner. I'm sorry you don't remember something so awful.  What restaurant does that?!?",

Ummm, that's always been a standard of yours and wonder why I was ONLY table without?  Ordered street tacos, margarita, and shrimp tostada appetizer. The margarita was 1/3 of the size of the former Scottsdale location and there was no hint of tequila in it (also $8 on Happy Hour??) The street tacos were fantastic and better than I remembered!! The shrimp tostada appetizer was just okay- too much guac/hot sauce ration- out of balance.  I really wanted your yummy cornbread or even chips and salsa and wondered why it was never offered even though EVERY table had it except mine.  Very disappointing- there's a reason Scottsdale and Arcadia locations closed! Won't be back:(",

This has been one of Chandlers reliable happy hour spots with a great crowd over the years. My crowd type may differ from your crowd type, but the mix of professionals lends itself to a good laid back vibe and ideal location to meet up or socialized. Plenty of other spots in Chandler are available, but the food items and frozen margaritas are what really stands out. Yeah, if you like a sweet fruity taste to your drinks, then definitely go for the special frozen Chambord Margarita (on happy hour special of course) and it's strong & good!!  Happy Hour runs M-F 3-7pm & on the weekends from 3-5pm. Apps I believe are $3.00off so worth it. The food items are really good and I think that is what separates it from the other happy hours in the area. As usual, I went with the Catfish Beignets, Grilled Shrimp and Guacamole Tostada Bites & the Cast Iron Skillet Dumplings...   My only complaint the last go-round was the service I and a few other at the bar received. It wasn't crowded, but we felt rushed and not really appreciated. From requesting more water, getting another drink, or placing a food order, it was just way to difficult.",

We ordered a few appetizers: quesadillas and table side guac. It was awesome that they had the option to add fresh veggies instead of chips for those trying to eat healthy!   For my entree, I ordered the crispy salmon with double veggies instead of rice. It comes with a crab and avocado salad piled on top. The salmon crust was crispy, and thankfully not dry. I loved the vinaigrette that all over the plate. The veggies were string zucchini, squash, carrots and green beans. They were a perfect pairing.   Everyone else in our large group also loved their meals. One got the Voodoo pasta and a few ordered the street tacos. We were all super pleased with the food, the service and the atmosphere.",

We started with the corn bread, which was some of the best I've ever had. Great starter and would highly recommend. I had the hardest time picking my main meal, but I heard great reviews about the enchiladas. They were the perfect lunch size, but they were just alright.

So when a friend suggested this (because I've been working in Tempe), I was stoked.  We came for lunch and from the start things were bad. The waiter was MIA the whole time. I sat with empty water and tea. He delivered our food and never asked about it. I literally had to flag down another waiter to get drinks.  The food was very underwhelming. It tasted old and processed.  By the time we flagged the waiter down for the second time, we asked for the check. He quickly dropped it off and then never came back. The place was less than half full.  I guess the good old days of going to ZTejas will stay in the past. I wish I could have at least gotten a marg, but can't during work. That's one thing I'm sure is still the same.",

The bar area is boring so don't expect a good time ... the cocktails people ... this is all about the cocktails.

When we sat down to order, I immediately asked the server \"Happy Hour all day\".  He said, Ummm I don't think so.  I told him there's a sign on the outside that said Happy Hour all day.  He walked outside, looked at the sign, came in and spoke with the manager.  Once he came back to our table he told us I saw the sign, it definitely says Happy Hour All Day Saturday but our manager said it's wrong. -_-  Cool!  2 Chambord Margaritas please!

It's been about a year since my last visit and I decided to give it another try. Wow, big mistake. We got to the restaurant about 1:00 pm, well after the lunch rush. Although something tells me they don't get big crowds. The restaurant was pretty quiet, not many patrons. We got seated at a booth by a window which was nice. After that the whole experience sucked.  The waiter finally came to take our order. About 20 minutes later he came by the table and I asked about our food. Did they need to go to the store and buy it? And then prep it all? The restaurant was uncrowded. Why was it taking so long?  Surprise! He immediately comes out with the food. And guess what? It was COLD! I was not happy, but since I hadn't eaten anything all day and was starving, I ate it.   It was really gross to eat something cold that would've been so delicious if served hot.  At least the food temp went up to 98.6 once it got inside my tummy. Oh, and the waiter, Ryan, never apologized or gave us a reason for the delay.  Clearly it had been ready for a while and he neglected to get it.  Terrible service.  He never once came by to ask us how it was, as is customary in most restaurants.  Probably because he knew he messed up big time.   I did not see any manager on duty, which may be part of the problem. This restaurant has been in decline for quite some time now. It's sad because it used to be a great place and now it just SUCKS!  And I have to mention that my husband's burger looked quite red inside.  Definitely NOT medium well as ordered.  Please do yourself a favor and go anywhere else but here. Not worth the frustration and the food's not cheap either.  If I could give it zero stars I would.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: Primarily A Staff Review after Addressing our Dining Visit In all fairness, one star less only due to the seriousness of addressing quality control.  Passing through this area of AZ, we had an impromptu lunch catching up with friends here, as they selected the venue based on a previous enjoyable dining experience. Really open dining area, bright, upbeat, and with attentive service. My experience here, I admit, can NOT be about the food per say. Hospitality in Arizona is very consistently positive. Despite our unfortunate experience here, my review will display how the treatment from the venue staff really affects a customer's dining experience in its entirety.  I chose a light appetizer of the mango salsa ahi poke on tortilla bites to share, as we had just had a huge breakfast earlier in the day. Our friends highly recommended the tacos and the mushroom enchilada.  There is a trio of salsa and chips to accompany our meal. I felt festive and ordered a summer sangria and it was delicious.  On the first bite of the ahi mango appetizer however, my guy immediately stopped chewing and pulls out a metal item.  It shocked all of us... As it was the tip of a knife or some blade of a food processor maybe, but the size of his thumbnail.  It is by far the scariest dining incident I have ever encountered.  Immediately, he excused himself to the restroom to remove anything else he had in his mouth still and came back assuring us he was okay. By that time, our server already addressed us, removed our appetizer without hesitation, asked us if we may want something else. Within moments, the manager approaches us to ensure everyone's safety. Initially, before this review, I was hesitant to report on this Yelp forum vs their corporate site, what happened, as I really did not want to make it any more unfavorable as the situation was addressed thoroughly , but in hopes that other diners may ever encounter something like this, gosh forbid, they also will have the management be as attentive and professional as we encountered.  In the end, the staff did their best to remedy this unfortunate experience.  We can see how absolutely sorry they are. They immediately addressed needing to remove any processed food items necessary or already been prepared with similar tools, and all inspection of their kitchen tools in use. I'm confident they are inspecting each item thoroughly and continuously even after this particular incident.   I ordered up a cup of chicken tortilla soup in the meantime and still enjoyed my cocktail.  My guy insisted he was okay and while his appetite, understandably enough, went away, he did not dwell on it any further. We have both worked in the dining industry and while we have never encountered something like this, we genuinely feel it could have happened to anyone, maybe even in my own kitchen.  Maybe exaggerated, maybe not. Scary, nonetheless. The staff addressed the situation very professionally. I don't know myself, what further they could have done. The manager hands me his card, even after learning we were from CA, and insists that if we ever do return, to be certain to ask for him.  He notes that he hopes we will return for another visit in the future and give them a chance again.  Without our asking or expectations, yes they ended up comping our meal in its entirety, still pologizing profusely.  We made sure to leave a generous gratuity because I can't deny our server was anything but awesome and displays genuine pride in his job, even prior to the incident at hand. He had even suggested a new brunch place to check out since we commented earlier how we loved Cracker Barrel in AZ, engaging in conversation with us. I truly feel they wish they could have done more for us.  But, we really couldn't press the issue any further as we were all safe from what we could see.  Made for an interesting lunch topic, though! Relieved no one was hurt, more than anything. Angry, no. Would we return? I feel we may.  My only wish is that they continue to check their kitchen tools and I hope nothing like this ever occurs again.  I think we all learned something invaluable from this situation.",

We made a reservation ahead of time, which was confirmed this morning when the restaurant staff called me, and the food and service were both great. We were provided with 2 servers to help things run smoothly and it worked out really well. The only issues: one server forgot to bring my coworker her drink, but she apologized and made it right immediately upon realizing it; we had just a little back and forth with the order of the checks being passed out (almost all were individual). I really can't fault the servers, though...we were 15 people and 12 of us wanted our own bill. It was fixed quickly and all with a smile and professionalism. All in all, an awesome experience!",

They have an extensive menu with many unique items. Had a Margarita for $5 from the happy hour menu (weekdays 2 - 7).  For my entree, I chose the Anciote chopped chicken salad.  An interesting choice. The grilled anchored chicken was seasoned and cooked expertly.    It was placed on top of shredded iceberg, Roma tomatoes, red cabbage, cotija corn, black olives and pepitas.  Each in it's own section of the salad platter.  Oh, and I almost forgot, we had the Tejas Trio from the happy hour appetizer menu consisting of salsa, cheese sauce Nd guacamole.  Good Stuff!  The service was great with our server actually boxing our leftovers for us along with extra chips.  Nicely done!",

One small gripe is that their beer selection could use improvement.  They did have a couple Four Peaks available (good IPA), but they could stand to have a couple more local or micro options.  We skipped appetizers, and went straight to an entree with the exception of chips and salsa.  The chips were fresh and the salsa was above average.  I had the Santa Fe Smoked Chicken Enchilada with beans and rice.  The enchilada was really good, with the sauce having a good amount of spice.  The cornbread that was included with the meal was worth mentioning as well.  Overall a good meal and I would return when back in the area.",

The menu (I assume because of brunch) was very limited. We got the trio chips appetizer which we both liked. Nothing special but good. DH got a draft beer which was flat. I had ice tea it was fine. I ordered the seafood enchiladas, DH the Barbacolla enchiladas. Both were horrible. Tasteless. There was no spice, no heat, bland and gross. Maybe good for our winter visitors. Our waiter was fine. There was a tray of dirty dishes right behind DH the entire time we were there, besides the fact that it was right by the wait station where at least 5 wait staff placed orders there.

I had the chicken artichoke stack (which I always get) and Tea. $14 lunch plus tip.  However I was disappointed with T'ejas not having \"lunch size portions\" they had a lunch menu that is the same as the dinner menu but without the steaks and a few other items. They also monthly features on a separate printed piece but I thought was a bit pricey for lunch. (Sorry Z) I was looking for  something lighter and smaller for lunch. Of course I only ate half,  but could not take with me because I had no where to store until I returned home.  I assure everyone it was good.  I will return for happy hour and dinner.",

Not a bad eh, which is usually a 2 for me, but more like an I'll-come-back-here-if-someone-else-is-dying-to eh, which leaves it at a 3.  I can say that the cornbread is exquisite. It's what cornbread should be. Corn and bread. It's not cornmeal trying to be cornbread. It's not some yuppie metropolitan height of sophistication's chef trying to be country. It's the no shit real deal. I appreciate that. I just have to remember to appreciate it in small quantities.  The service was pretty on par for it being lunch on a Monday.   My main dish was the seafood enchilada which was pretty on point, but not as good as the one at Blue Adobe. I was pretty annoyed to see it came with tomato even though tomato was listed nowhere on the menu. I will remember that. I may just return and order cornbread with a side of cornbread.",

The shrimp tostadas, fish tacos and tortilla soup are very good as well. The Chambord margarita is delicious and I like the pomegranate-ginger  margarita martini drink, the ginger-sugar rim is very tasty.

We ordered three appetizers and two rounds of the delish chambord margaritas. I am not usually one for frozen drinks, but this was wonderful - like frozen raspberry lemonade with a great kick!  My second time, I went with a big group of kids and adults for lunch. Everything we ordered was perfect and delish and the service was great.  The third time, I went just for the chambord margerita on a friday night with my husband around 10pm. It was standing room only - packed - all the pre-clubbers were getting their drink on.   I have been another handful of times just for the Chambord Margerita. The food is great, but the prices are a bit high for what you get. I will still frequent.",

This particular restaurant completely forgot about one person's food and he had to eat awkwardly after everyone else was already done.  They comped his meal, but since he wasn't paying for it anyway, it was no consolation to him.  No me gusta!",

Z'Tejas has a survey on your receipt  that will give you a free appetizer with the purchase of one entree \"if you complete it\".  Due to this, we have not paid the $9 or whatever amount it is for the Nacho's or any appetizer in years!  We just keep going and turning in survey's.  The service is great.  I think the price is kind of high. . maybe by about $2 per entree, but its good food and the free appetizer offsets the higher price.  Additionally, we've been going there for over 5 years and there's no change in their menu. The menu pretty much stays the same. They have special entree's once in a while, but would like to see new selections added to their menus.  Other than that we've tried almost everything on their menu and its all good. . Great salads too.    Suggestion:  order one salad and split it if your not that hungry. The salads are huge!",

My staples: the fish tacos, the catfish beignets, and now the Achiote Chicken chopped salad!  The tacos and beignets are always delish, but this salad is seriously scrumptious.  It has corn, avacado, and pumpkin seeds in it--which sounds like a weird combo, but it's great!    Today, I also tried the southwester chicken soup.  So good-chunks of avocado with grilled chicken and tortilla chips.  The cornbread is always great too-definite comfort food.

Within 48 hours (I also emailed the review to their direct customer service email), I was contacted by multiple top managers in the company. What was even more amazing was that they didn't try to say \"Oh, we don't have any idea why that happened to you\" or \"that must have been a fluke.\" Instead, they acknowledged that they were already working through issues at that location, apologized repeatedly, thanked me for my feedback, and sent me gift cards with the promise that when I next returned I would have a different experience. And I have! I have been back twice since giving up on them and there is a marked difference - huge improvement in management and staff attitude/customer service, better food quality control, and just an overall happier vibe. I am back to thinking of Z as my \"go to\" place for brunch, happy hour, date night and business meetings alike.",

We weren't cussing or being vulgar language just laughing talking and having a good time. Again outside on the patio during Happy Hour. Apparently unbeknownst to us  another table felt were we being too loud and moved inside. The manager on duty at that time named Chris came outside and asked us to quiet down. And then had the audacity to say he didn't want to offend us. We all all corporate employees who know how to conduct ourselves in public and we're not in any way being disrespectful to others around us. Not only was I highly offended my bday kickoff was ruined. In a time when our country is dealing with so much racial insensitivity it was very offensive and a very poor decision on the managers part to come and ask a table full of paying patrons that were simply laughing, talking and enjoying themselves to quite down. Due to his lack of consideration for all of the customers he cause one of his waitresses to lose a lot of money that night and regardless we never should of been treated that way. I have no interest in ever visiting this restaurant ever again. Highly disappointed! Never have I ever been treated with such disrespect.",

I really liked the the corn bread that's complimentary..haha! Super warm, fluffy and delicious.  Weak wine list, but good margaritas/drinks. Service was great - our servers were constantly checking on us!   Overall, a decent option in Chandler, especially for groups of 2-6 people. Lots of the food is shareable.",

The restaurant no longer has an upscale ambiance like it used to. We had the catfish bignets which were good but not a good value for happy hour. I'd rather make the drive up to Scottsdale for a better experience.",

    "text": "I would like to thank Z for destroying my anniversary celebration. My wife has many many food allergies. So we don't go out too often. But when we do Z was one of our go to places. They used to have a gluten free menu. But they changed to a menu where they at least put a symbol by plates that were. They even once invented a dessert just so my wife could enjoy too. I was always impressed and that's why we came here.  First they sit us butted up against the service line. It was so loud I could not even hear my wife. Then I noticed a disturbing trend. The wait staff used right behind my head as a good place to hold meeting. Those meeting dealt with complaining, a LOT. Throw in some F-bombs and other language fit for a Waffle House and I was starting to get annoyed.  Then we notice, huh there are no markings on the menu for gluten free anymore. Well our waitress was BRAND NEW. I could see her shaking. She was sweet but the vibe of fear was coming through. My wife asked if she could ask what was up. Out comes a lady who said she was there 14 years. She tells us they just changed the menu MONDAY and this was the first time anyone noticed they forgot to mark things for gluten free. Now I am not sure how you miss this or if you are telling me this just to make it look like an over site? Are they going to REPRINT all the menus?  So we ask about fajitas for my wife, USUALLY they are a safe thing and she gets some meat and ton of vegetables. She eats very healthy and simply and understands she might not get the fanciest dishes. The lady comes back after a good wait and says the chef does not know what is in the marinade. THE CHEF DOES NOT KNOW WHAT IS IN THE FOOD. So now I am done. I think they have finally just decided to go the Chilis route. Order frozen stuff, heat it up and pass it off as home made. Well I am sorry, I am ok with that if I am paying 10.99 a plate. But that is NOT Z Tejas. We got up and left and more than likely won't be back.  So if you USED to go to this place because of your food allergies I would think again. I am saddened because we have lost a good place. They used to be so darn nice and accommodating to my wife. I have been known to leave 25% tips here because they always took that extra step to help my wife and I really appreciated it. I have an idea this is what we will see more of because it is hard paying your staff the new minimum wage and not raise the prices. Just wished we would have known before they ruined my anniversary.",

We're not the type to send food back, because let's face it, you don't mess with the cook!  I ordered the fajitas, and usually when fajitas are served, they are sizzling and smelling fabulous, not here! They bring you maybe a qtr of chicken breast and the rest peppers! Husband had the Flour stuffed burrito, steak with red sauce, the description sounds amazing and full of life, however NOT at all what he got, it looked more like an enchirito from taco bell, and that's being nice. Expressed our concern to the waitress, (Not her fault at all);she went and told the manager, and he just stood there and looked crazy as we walked out, didn't try to stop us or anything. Big mistake, because word of mouth can help or hurt Buisness. Dont waste your money or time here, you won't be happy you did.Oh and by the way, we paid over 75.00 bucks! Smh.

I ordered the Eggs Bene Z' Style which has the poached eggs on top of their delicious cornbread with chipotle hollandaise and jalapeno bacon, and a side of breakfast potatoes.  I've got to get over being bashful with my camera because this was a good-looking dish, and tasted even better.  If you're feeling a little adventurous give it a try, you won't be disappointed.  Every aspect of that dish was perfect and I'm still thinking about it.  Mr. M ordered the Hickory Burger and that was another item worthy of a picture.  Cooked medium rare as he ordered it, the smoky flavors were delicious and the sweet potato fries were very good as well.  I can't rave enough about the service.  We had a couple of the $4 mimosas and then for dessert shared a ginger something something martini.    We sat in the bar area and were greeted immediately with an explanation of the bloody mary/mimosa bar options.  The bartender brought us the champagne, and then we added our choice of juice.  The mango juice is a phenomenal choice.  When it came time for the ginger something something martini, we said we were going to share it.  The bartender was so funny and said he didn't want any fighting over the drink, so he made it with 2 glasses and we each got a healthy pour of about 2/3rds the glass.  That drink was one to savor, with I think crystallized ginger on the rim.  Delicious!  Two bartenders took care of us and I wish I would have caught their names because they were prompt, friendly, and funny.  5-stars all the way.  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "My friend and I went to eat here while we were out of town with our kids.  The kids didn't really care either way about the food or service so I'll only talk about kid food quickly and just note what the adults observed and from two different prospective:  We were sat pretty quickly and given our menus.  I thought the menu was boring and lacked any kind of imagination.  My friend thought it was swell.  (Menu has brunch and 10 different kinds of Mexican food orders all \"tex-mex\" style).  They have a Bloody Mary bar and a Mimosa bar which is actually kinda cool and something that I had never seen before.  You order the booze, they bring it to you and you go to the bar and put in your fixins.  The offer different tomato juices, garnishes,  and spices for the Mary's and then OJ and different berries for the mimosas.  My friend got a Mimosa and had fun doing it.  I drank tea 'cause I don't dig on boozing it up before 6:00.    The decor is pretty cool.  They are trying to be super up-scale but it's not really working.  It really just looks like any other chain I've ever been - it was nicer than say......a Chevy's but I wasn't horribly impressed.  My friend thought it was pretty neat and enjoyed the fun liquor bottle tree they had on display.  (Wrought Iron with empty bottles glued to the stems).  Okay - DRUM ROLL - Food time:  They serve cornbread where most places would serve chips and salsa.....I think that's weird.  My friend thought it was cool and said it was very tasty.  I'd just as soon have them take $2.00 off the bill and keep it away from me when my palate is gearing up for the Mexican dishes.  We both got the Smoked Chicken Enchiladas.  They totally don't come with quac and they charge $1.00 for it.  - NOT COOL.  The Enchiladas are not really Enchiladas.  They are two small soft shell taco tortillas with cheese and chicken in the middle of them.  Basically it's a $13.00 quesadilla.  It does come with rice and black beans and it does fill you up but it shouldn't be called an Enchilada.  I thought mine was just A-OK, bland and boring.   My friend got a chicken bone in hers.  It was pretty sizeable - probably about an inch long.  One kid got a burger which he liked.  The other kid got the poached eggs w/ potatoes.  He said the eggs were awesome but the potatoes were pretty poor and he wouldn't order them again.  My friend complained about the bone so the Manager took that entree off her bill and gave her a free slice of pie which was nice of him.  They have $10.00 tableside guac which is about 1/2 an avocado............huh.......all I'm saying is I can totally dice up 5 of my own avocados for that price.  I wouldn't go back.  I wanted to give this place 2 stars because the food was boring and the whole experience lacked anything worthy of memory retention.  I ended up giving it 3 because the Manager cared enough about bones to give away free pie.    My friend hated this place and if it were up to her the review would be lower.  But it's my Yelp, not her's so 3 stars it is.",

The food is identical to what we were used to in WA.  Their chicken chile relleno has a wonderful mix of flavors and is presented well.  And their cornbread is the best.  Service has always been great for us, even on our last visit when our server had a table of 20 plus three other tables and was still able to take our order, deliver the food piping hot, and check back a few times to make sure everything was as expected.  I'm looking forward to our next night out at Z'Tejas.",

I like that the proceeds from cornbread  goes to charity since it makes you treasure it even more.",

Oh, okay....I guess I won't spend more money on a drink and appetizer while wait. Makes no sense.  Update--------  Within 10 minutes of posting my review, the manager Steve came over and apologized for the treatment I experienced. The host that I had dealt with was new and had confused their Friday night seating policy. Steve promised to review the policy at their host/hostess meeting the next day.  After our meal Steve offered free deserts to our entire table.  Feel much better about this place.",

This was our first time going to this Chandler location and boy was it lovely!  We came kinda close to closing time. Around 8:15pm( they close at 9pm).  Our server was very friendly, attentive and nice which is always a huge plus. We were brought out chips and salsa for starters. I am not much of a chip girl but these chips were really well made and the salsa was quite tasty.  We also ordered a round of there cornbread because it is really yummy.  For entrees we both have our tradition of ordering the mushroom enchiladas. I know this may not sound appetizing to some but it is actually quite amazing even if you don't love mushrooms.  The food came out super quick it was awesome.  The prossecco they had in stock was high quality and we were brought little fruit cups at the end.  Overall we had  such a nice experience I am glad to hear they have a location in Austin Texas!",

Greeted kindly at the door, got to our seats, welcomed by our server, McKenna.  She was kind and talkative and inquired about our day.   More so than most, which made me feel a bit more connected to the experience.  The food was all very good (not super duper, but very good).  Wasn't sure what to expect as it's a new chain that I've never visited.  I ordered the turkey burger, and side salad, my wife ordered the Ahi tacos.  The table cornbread was fresh and yummy.  We also ordered table-side quac.  Well prepared, again by our server.  The bar looked entertaining with a beautiful Tequila Tree.  Wasn't in the mood for a drink but certainly would next time.    Everything was pretty good!  Would certainly return.",

    "text": "We heard today from my son who wife and he dined at the resturant Sat. evening about 7:30 pm. Work all day and get a chance to go out to sit down once or so a month and come away with less than expected dining.experience. We watched the kids to give them a chance to relax.  I asked if the resturant was busy and he says it didn't appear to be. The problem is the Fajitas which come, as he says on a platter with the fixings and a separte hot plate with the meat on one end. The meat wasn't hot and sizzling like it is suppose to be but luke warm. He should have sent it back but they were too hungry at that hour and just wanted to eat. I find fault with the server as this stuff should be put up to serve hot and if left on the bank to be picked up too long it isn't the kitchens fault. Like I said, he said it wasn't busy so the server must have been busy doing social things. maybe posting or catching up. But no reason to serve a dish on a cast iron plate if it isn't searing hot.  Don't get me wrong here as I have good reports from my wife who she and friends love  Zs.. i have never been there and i like my food served HOT. Zs just lucky it was my son and not me as you got a pass this time and a pass ain't that greeat. .",

Surely all those people weren't at Fleming's?  FOOD: The chips with three salsas appetizer was ok, but kind of pointless. They bring you a skillet of cornbread automatically, so paying for chips and average salsa is kind of a waste.  We both ordered the steak, which had a very tasty chipotle cream sauce on top. Included were garlic mashed potatoes and some steamed seasonal vegetables. In our case, this meant zucchini and carrots.  The steak was cooked well, exactly as ordered and was a good cut. I had originally eyed the chile relleno until I noticed that it was stuff with, among other things, raisins and apricots. No thanks.  They have a really good brunch that I've been to as well, with a \"Bloody Mary Bar\" where you get the liquor and the glass and get to choose your mixer, veggies, etc.",

We weren't upset about it we were just like hey, what about us? lol. Luckily for us, the person that happened to check on us just happened to be one of the manager's, who name I did not get. But she greeted us with a wonderful smile and asked if we had been helped. Sadly we said no and she took care of us right away with assigning Phillip to our table and he was fabulous. The first round of drinks was on the manager, which was really sweet. Again we were not upset at all, just wondering what happened. At any rate the strawberry margarita I received was delicious as always. We also ordered the Trio, which was on happy hour and consisted of chips, queso, and salsa. Delicious!!! Of course we had to order their signature cornbread, which was fresh out of the oven upon arrival. It was melt in your mouth delicious and yet so bad for you so you know it is extra good. By the time my yummy street tacos came, I was full from everything else.  Like I said before, Phillip, our waiter was awesome, the food was delicious, and my company was as fabulous as ever. Will I come back to this location? Of course! I chalk it up a slight mishap and a busy evening. Plus in the end, the food and service was great so what more could you ask for?",

Burger was dry and overly herby, fries were NOT well done and not even done-done in my opinion - sorta stale even.  Free corn bread is a nice perk cuz it's quite good and served very hot in a little fancy cast-iron pan with a big 'ol steak knife for servin' & a side a' butter.  Everyone you talk to who has been to Z'Tejas will mention the corn bread, the corn bread, the corn bread.  Yippie yay.   It managed to upstage my $11 turkey-blah-ger.  So, congrats, overachieving cornbread, to a job well done!  Service:  Our server was friendly and attentive and she let us talk prior to ordering without interrupting us.  Generally a good vibe here.  Food overall is just...meh, in my opinion.  I didn't try my companions entrees at all, though they had no complaints.

By The Way, I think they should serve complimentary chips and salsa instead of the complimentary cornbread.   Any how, I ordered the Guac and the Chips and Salsa. The 3 salsas were, House salsa (tasted like spaghetti sauce, too sweet, yuck) Verde with avocado and tomatillo ( good but really bland, I had to add salt) and Fire roasted ( most decent of the three but still on the sweet side and I had to add salt.)   The Guacamole was the most disappointing of all though. I did order it with out cheese and onions but that shouldn't have made a difference. It was completely lack luster and flavorless. No Lime juice or seasonings were added to it at all, except Salt, by me.  And I rarely salt anything.  The husband did enjoy his breakfast enchiladas.   The only reason they are getting 3 stars is because I do appreciate them having a small V/GF/VEG menu. Other than that, I wasn't impressed.",

My husband and I went on a Sunday afternoon and they had a martini bar.  Loved it!  I had the under 550 calorie fish with pesto and cilantro. It seriously tasted like way more calories.  I totally recommend this to anyone who likes fresh dishes, good service and a relaxing atmosphere.",

I always go for lots of cilantro and lime. The pork nachos were delightful and really filling. Half price bottles of wine on Mondays and Tuesdays!",

    "text": "Zteja's consistently delivers good food. I frequent the Chandler location for lunch because it's near my office. \"Satisfied\" is the feeling I walk away with every time.... Not ecstatic, not disappointed.   I particularly like that they've updated their menu to include vegetarian and gluten-free sections.  They've always offered these selections, but you had to pick through it and remove meat... but get charged for it!  The new menu allows you to get regular items without meat at a reduced price... me likely ;-).    My favorites are the Ancho Chopped Salad (Minus the meat and bacon) and the mushroom enchiladas.   Their chips and salsa are okay, but not really worth paying the $4 for.  I would recommend holding off for the corn bread... hint, hint... they don't bring it out until you order, it kills their ability to up-sale!   I definitely recommend Zteja's for lunch, its good food with quick service (45min out the door).  My actual rating is 3.5, but that's not an option.",

    "text": "Z how much do I love thee? Let me count the ways... This is not your everyday Mexican food restaurant, they put their own extremely delicous spin on it.  Always good service and more often then not some real eye candy servers too =P Their Margarita's are the best in the valley, very tasty and strong! Well worth the price.  The complimentary corn bread is good but the butter it comes with is the best part, so sweet and delicious, definitely elevates the cornbread.  Shrimp tostada bites, best appetizer ever invented! Some days I just get these as my main meal so I do not have to share.  This is a must on the list when we bring newbies.  Every main dish I've ever had at Z has been great, love the Tortilla Soup, love their Salads, their Trout and Salmon are always so tasty, they do rice and beans perfectly.  I'd have to say where Z really shines though is their weekend brunch.  First you've got the bloody mary bar with all the fixings.  Then brunch comes with cornbread and delicious fresh baked muffins, a delicious sorbet & fruit palette cleanser and the main dish is always so scrumptious.  My favorites are the barbacoa enchiladas, the breakfast enchiladas and the chile quilles.  Sooooooo much food for an extremely reasonable price.  This is why I hit up Z's at least once or twice a month. Love it!",

    "text": "Probably one of the better places to take a date, not to secluded, a busy restaurant yet you can carry on a conversation.  My pork arrived a bit raw so I did send it back, and I was hoping to get some kind of discount for it, but I've had way to many meals at this place so I can overlook it.  A bit pricey, but you can't find the type of food they make any where else.  I wish they had the Chilean Sea Bass all the time but it's seasonal, the most unbelievable piece of fish I've had.",

I liked the variety on the menu, little bit of everything to fit whatever you are in the mood for or can afford,  light to heavy, inexpensive to pricier.  I thought their drink prices were a little high (margaritas were around $8 or more and I thought they should be around $6 for a house marg), but the waiter told us they were still running happy hour, I had a couple of drafts and I was happy with those prices.  We'll go back again for sure, looking forward to it.  And there are lots of places in the valley we would NOT go back to.",

    "text": "I could not figure out how this chain stays in business considering the quality of their food. I conducted some business research and found out they are privately owned by the same guys who started PF Changs. OK, now I get it. This place is all flash with no substance. I have had better food at roadside taco shops. The owners know their audience; people who go into a place to make a  statement rather than to eat good food. If you are a 30sish wannabe pseudo urban sophisticate, Z'Tejas is for you. If you want to have real Tex-Mex food, you might want to pass on this. Plenty of other options in the Phoenix area that offer better quality and an equal or better dining experience.",

    "text": "Loved the atmosphere. The greeter was friendly. Waiter acted like he had better things to do....and in fact, he did. He was hungry. I suppose watching us eat made him jealous. I spotted him in the corner by the kitchen eating something out of a bowl. Nevermind the fact that # 1, I could see him but # 2, that I was eating an extremely spicy dish and my soda was donezo! He made it a point to fill my friends water glass several times, kudos for that, maybe cuz it was free. I had to ASK for a refill, which is a big no-no in the restaurant industry. Your customers shouldn't have to ask, a new drink should be brought to the table when the old one is about half empty. food was okay, expensive though for what you get. And by the way, staff members that stand around talking to each other when you have tables you should be tending to, another big no-no.",
