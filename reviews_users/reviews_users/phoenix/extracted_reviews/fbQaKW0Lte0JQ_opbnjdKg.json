We were in a short line and the service took about an hour to get our food. It was so ridiculous and then they were out of corn tortillas so my mom ending up getting nothing. Not worth it. Cornbread is also getting spicer and spicer which I don't like too",

We take people from out of town on a consistent basis, and there are always requests to return. I have also seen them used for catering, the food translates very well to a catering format. Went by the new location recently, just as good as the Original. The \"festival tacos\" are not to be missed. But The classic enchiladas are out of this world. Unique fun toppings, avocado Crema, pickled onions, great salsas, etc. I hear that someone is up at about 430 every morning braising the various meats, it shows in the quality. Glad there are 2 locations now!",

It just opened and we have been there twice already.  So many great items to choose from and everything is fresh and super tasty!   The staff is very friendly and helpful.   Especially Candice who is there to greet you with smile and very eager to answer questions and guide you through the menu.   How great is that?!   Not many places go the extra mile to have someone greet you and help you make the best choice for your meal~ especially someone as personable and friendly as Candice.   Walk~ Ride your Bike~ or Drive to Gadzooks!  You will be very happy you did.",

A perfect pairing with my soup. My wife chose the double decker Head Honcho's Nachos with jalapeno ranch and the green chile pork and the tomatillo chicken. She commented that they were the best nachos in Phoenix. She paired her nachos with a pink grapefruit margarita which she said was excellent. What a great place to relax on a Sunday with a lite brunch. The staff was very accommodating since this was our first time there. Would highly recommend.",

    "text": "I like the Gadzook's food, but ironically (for a soup place) this particular location channels too much of the Soup Nazi from Seinfeld for my like.  This is particularly True with large groups, of which my family (6) is constantly one.  Mostly the ordering process is relatively painful for groups - lots of choices but one at a time - and I thin the staff in turn are constantly stressed out.  I gave this location a second chance, and it was about the same as the first, with a particular worker asking with my 10 year old child 3 times with considerable annoyance to hurry up and because she was holding up the line.  Frankly she wasn't holding it up, because everything else was still queued up and there were only 2 new arrivals behind my party, but they have an inefficient amount of space to work with, and the lines can just blow out of control here in a heart beat.  First time we came in on a Sunday there was actually a crowd and we had almost a 30 minute wait to get through line, so I can imagine they must be standing on pins and needles behind the counter constantly worrying about whether its going off the rails.  But for $10 meals, I don't need to get in a fight or have my fairly sensitive kid harangued by adults.",

We've come here a few times in the last couple weeks because it just opened and I live in the neighborhood. We love the staff except for the short brunette with short curly hair, she's been rude and disrespectful every time. Idk what her deal is but she's not welcoming. She accused us of trying to steal another customers order after we paid our $40 order. I don't understand because the other associate had just put all of the fillings on our tacos and then the short brunette started packing them up and was grilling us about how many tacos we got. I let the first rude interaction go but four attempts going back later and she's still just as rude...I understand a bad day but that's just bad service. I hesitate to go anymore because I literally don't want to see her and deal with her attitude...I just want tacos.",

I love the Cornbread with both sauces, cheese and add in pickled onions and I am so happy. My hubby loves the Bison and the Short Rib and they also offered Chicken and Pork. The 50/50 Corn and Flour tortillas are the best although just corn is available. If you eat in the tacos are good as well, haven't yet tried the nachos but don't doubt at all that they are good.

I wasn't sure if I was remembering correctly so I asked the guy at the counter if the pickled onions were spicy. He said \"no.\" I said \"Are you sure, because I remember last time that they were pretty spicy.\" He said \"Some people thing mayo is spicy.\" No, no one thinks mayo is spicy and the pickled onions are, in fact, quite spicy. As is the guacamole and all of the meat except the pork. Accordingly, there is virtually nothing for my kids to eat here because their palates are still pretty mild.

    "text": "Definitely the WHOLE ENCHILADA!  Since you can customize your order you can address all of your dietary needs. We had the roasted tomatillo chicken, green chile pork and the smashed jack potato. I think the creamy potato was my favorite. Lots of complimentary toppings to cool off or add crunch to your zesty Enchiladas. They have lots of other options to include tacos, soup, nachos. An added bonus, they open early so you can satisfy your cravings in the morning and beat the lunch rush!",

It looks Chipotle-esque when you first walk in. You order on a line and pick between a few different options. I ordered the chop salad with roasted tomatillo chicken! WOW! The chicken was so juicy and flavorful. I added the pickled onion, the slaw and guacamole. The awesome staff member behind the counter helped me pick the best options. He then took all of the salad ingredients and actually chopped them up together! Every single bite had amazing chicken, dressing, veggies and guac! It was beyond fantastic and I will definitely be back! Give it a try!",

Super casual place and AMAZING selection. I am kind of a brat when it comes to tortillas and usually order my usual flour. When I was told the tortillas were a combo of flour and corn I was immediately turned off.. but when the thing hit my tongue I realized I didn't know what I was talking about.  amazing the meat had great flavor and I didn't know which to try because they all looked equally flavored and seasoned. I usually get my kids a bean and cheese burrito but they don't have beans so I went with the Dilla which was super cute because that's what my 3 year old used to call them anyway.  they ate it UP WITH chicken which I can usually never get them to eat.",

    "text": "Usually when a brand says they are \"redefining\" something it's a lot of marketing speak garbage and their product is no different than anything else. So when I saw \"redefining the enchilada\" on the exterior wall of Gadzooks I was skeptical. But these guys are not messing around. I've never had enchiladas like this before!  My husband and I stopped in on a Sunday night for dinner. My first impression was that it's kinda like Chipotle for enchiladas. You pick out what you want as you go down the line. First time in of course we had to go with enchiladas, although you could get tacos or a salad or soup. I went with the 50/50 tortillas (half corn, half flour) and short rib in one, combo of chicken and cornbread in the other. Red sauce and jack cheese on top. The do not skimp on ingredients. The enchiladas were stuffed and they put a ton of sauce and cheese on top.   Into the oven they go and then you wait for a couple minutes. I added crema to mine after (because why not?).   First bite. OMG. So much flavor. Everything just blended together so well into a meaty, cheese, saucy mess of goodness. The cornbread is outstanding. Next time I'm gonna get one that's just all cornbread! And two enchiladas was plenty. We were both full after we stuffed our faces.   I really enjoyed this place and will definitely go back. I hope they open up a few more locations!",

Gadzooks is an assembly line style of fast casual, delicious enchiladas and tacos.  Their tortillas are thick and chewy, I had the 50/50 corn and flour tortillas which, I think, is the key to these enchiladas.   As for fillings, I got three enchiladas: 1 with braised short ribs, 1 with pork shoulder, and 1 with cornbread.  I opted for the Christmas sauce (Half green sauce, half red sauce) and asadero cheese topped on my enchiladas before they went straight to the wood fired oven.  Once removed, you get to choose the toppings for your beautiful, colorful, warm enchiladas. They have just enough salsas and toppings to choose from without being too overwhelming. Their arbol and Habanero salsas are nice and spicy!   I would definitely recommend this place to anyone with an enchilada craving. The enchiladas are stuffed, cheesy, gooey, warm, mouth watering goodness.",

    "text": "Something I'd like to add to my original review (please make sure to read that as well) is that in my most recent visit, they had a new guy working the toppings area. After paying for everything (including $1.65 for guacamole) I moved over to him. I asked for the guacamole and he gave me something like half a teaspoon, which he carefully scooped from the container. I had to ask for a little more about 5 times until I just gave up and took my food (at this point I probably had less than a tablespoon).  I've never had problems here like this before, but this was kind of pathetic. I assume it's just a lack of training seeing as he seemed very new, but I still felt it should be addressed.  On another note, in the time since I first ate here and wrote my original review, I began eating meat again after a long time. Having now nearly all of the fillings, I have to say they're fantastic.   Through all of this I have discovered that all of their meatless fillings (smashed jack potato, spinach mushroom, and cornbread) are not vegan as far as I can tell, which is unfortunate considering it would be fairly easy to make a vegan friendly filling to accommodate their many vegan options.",

    "text": "Well, okay.  So I broke one of my cardinal rules about new restaurants.  Why not break the other?  Normally, I like to wait a few months after a restaurant opens to give them a chance to work out the kinks, but this time, my daughter insisted we go, so we did.  I also don't normally write a review after only one visit.  However, Gadzooks is worthy.  I was a bit unsure about going here, as I've been watching their construction progress for almost a year, anticipating an unannounced opening.  Well, I guess they did it, and opened about a week ago.  We rolled in about 6:00pm on a Thursday and they were doing a steady business.  Clearly the management knows how to start up a restaurant, as the line appeared to be staffed with seasoned, experienced people.  Everybody was calm, there was no confusion, panicking or running around.  People moved through the line quickly and efficiently.  This concept is a \"build your own\" enchilada or taco.  You start with freshly-made-before-your-eyes tortillas in a heavy stoneware dish.  You fill it with your choice of a variety of meat/vegetarian fillings, add a sauce, some cheese, and it goes into the oven for achieving a cheesy/melty/crispy consistency.  Moving through the line, you order beverages from a fine selection of Mexican beers, margaritas or sodas.  Then you add the garnishes like salsa, house-made crema, cotija, and a variety of spicy sauces.  You can eat there or take away.  We chose to dine on the patio, which was a bit noisy, being next to Camelback road, but we were able to carry on a normal conversation.  I had the 50/50 flour/corn tortilla, with a green-chile pork filling, green sauce and cheese.  garnished with cotija and crema, the presentation made for a tasty-looking treat.  It tasted as good as it looked.  I would have preferred a bit more spice in the green-chile, but that's just me.  Daughter had potato filling, and I got a taste of that.  Everything was clearly fresh-made and quite delicious.   For me, Gadzooks is a welcome addition to my neighborhood and I look forward to leisurely bike rides up to the canal for a tasty dinner.",

    "text": "If you love salt with an undying passion, then Gadzooks is nirvana for you! I am fond of salt. But not this much salt. In fact, we used the chips as foils for the incredibly salty enchiladas. If you know anything about chips, then you know that their main properties are crunchiness and salt. And the chips at Gadzooks are no exception. So good. The best thing we ate there. But especially because they were a \"neutral\" and less salty flavor compared to the insane salt-bomb of everything else. To the managers I say, please, please stop with the salt. This place is gorgeous. We watched it being built all year. Arcadia is happy to have you. (But we here are a health-loving bunch-even if we're eating enchiladas!) The view of the sunset is gorgeous from here. But we can't go back. It was just too salty. I'm not a negative reviewer normally but c'mon, this was insane! I want to keep typing but my fingers are swelling from the salt so I'll have to stop here.",

    "text": "3/5 for food and 1/5 for service. I think that, because of all the amazing reviews, we were expecting to be blown away, but our experience was pretty mediocre here.   As some other reviewers have mentioned, the line is long and the portions aren't very big. The service was what killed it for us, though. I couldn't hear half of what the workers were saying (the restaurant was really loud and they didn't make any effort to speak up), and they didn't explain anything, even though it was fairly obvious that we'd never been there before. They also talk to you from way down the counter, asking you questions about the food before you can see what they're talking about, so we were really confused. I feel like we would have liked the food we got more if we had been able to make choices while we were actually looking at the food in question. The girl working at the cash register was nice, and took the time to clarify some things we were wondering about.   When we got to the salsa/dressing section, we asked several questions about which salsas were spicier than others, etc., and the guy working there just said, \"I don't know, I haven't tried them,\" and left it at that. He didn't offer to let us sample them or anything, he just kept looking at us until we blindly picked one. He also didn't give us enough salsa (half of a small cup) for the chip order, and my salad had the same amount of dressing, so it was dry.  As for the food itself, we got short rib enchiladas (Christmas style) on 100% corn tortillas (they also have a 50% corn & 50% flour option), a chopped salad with pork shoulder, and chips & salsa. The short ribs were juicy and decent, but somewhat lacking in flavor. The enchilada sauces paired really well together, and they didn't skimp on the cheese, so that was nice. The pork shoulder in the salad was the more flavorful meat, and I really enjoyed it. It was probably my favorite part of the food. The pickled onions are really good, but make sure to ask for extra, because they don't give much. As for the rest of the salad, the slaw and lettuce were left bland because there wasn't enough dressing. I would've liked pico, but the salsa guy just looked at me when I asked for it twice, and we had already had a weird experience with him, so I just moved on. I didn't feel like the salad was worth the price, because it just didn't have enough in it. The chips were really good and fresh, but the salsa experience was lacking - we didn't love the one we chose, and we had no guidance at all as to what would have been better.  Overall, this didn't turn out to be the new favorite we were hoping for. We'll probably give it another try on a day where it isn't so busy now that we understand the ordering process better, and hope for better service. So far, though, we haven't found anything \"crave-worthy\" in the food here, and the service definitely leaves something to be desired.",

Everything is clean the staff is friendly. Music is at a decent level and is kind of house music sort of. The enchiladas are like building your own experiment. I tried the garlic mashed potatoes they are wonderful! You will have garlic breath for a while after eating these but boy are they good! Your enchiladas are made to order, so you are in control of what goes in them.The pablano pepper stuffed with whatever meat and vegetables you'd like is a tasty option I enjoyed. They put red, Green, or no sauce on it, two choices of cheese  and throw it into an open oven sort of like at fired pie. After it's perfectly warmed you have more choices to top it with salsa, a slaw mix that is excellent or pico de gallo along with many other dressing type of things.Drinks include your typical fountain drinks, negra Modelo amongst other beer choices, and bottled orange Fanta. It's a bit intimidating when you first walk in the place and don't understand how it works with choices and even which end of the counter to start at, but the staff are very helpful. Be sure to try the braised short rib meat in one of your dishes. Green chile pork shoulder is very good also, and not too spicy. We feel the price is a bit high for what you get, $9.50 for two  stuffed poblano peppers is a bit steep. My husband's two enchiladas were $8 50. Our two meals, chips and salsa, a beer and a Fanta cost $29. Choices of salsa... I would go for that green over the red since the green has a little more cilantro flavor to it.if you want to go super hot they do have the habanero option also. Overall this is a good place to check out. But be sure to bring a fat wallet or a credit card with plenty of space.",

    "text": "Fantastic concept!   Gadzooks is delicious. Their meats and fillings are top notch (bison is my personal favorite), and the toppings/salsas you add on make the flavors pop even more. I recommend getting both kinds of cheeses, the Christmas (both red and green) sauce, and an egg on top, but that's the fat kid in me! There are endless possibilities that appeal to just about any tastebud. Probably the best thing you'll put in your mouth are the house-made half flour half corn tortillas...oh my goodness they are fabulous! The cookies and desserts look terrible, they may be good but I haven't tried them; they just don't look appetizing. Other than that everything else on the menu is perfection.    The reasons I give 4 instead of 5 stars is due to the lack of competency and enthusiasm of the staff and how slow the process and service is. It is also very pricey for the amount of food that you get, but then again it is quality. This location is fairly new, so maybe the staff and speed will improve with time, but until then it's 4 stars.   Gadzooks is great, if you haven't done so already you should check it out!",

I chose the potato option and then the spinach option. They grab corn tortillas..not flour...and begin placing your choice of filling. Then it's basically whatever else you want in. They top with cheese (your choice of 2 types) and put it in the wood fired oven. It comes out looking delicious just like that...with the cheese all melty and crispy. But then! You add all these flavorful toppings. I'm more of a savory person so I liked the pickled items.  And that's not all. They sell some sort of cornbread item, like a cornbread casserole. You have to have it. I'm not good with coming up with other adjectives than great/awesome but that should work...it is absolutely awesome! They have 2 locations, and this was at the Camelback Road location. Great new addition to my bookmarks!",

Another with the potato and jack with red sauce. Also with the same cheese. Nothing fancy. Just wanted to get a taste of the food. Also ordered a bag of chips and guac. I felt really ripped off for a half bag of chips and a small 1 or 2 ounce container of guac for 5 bucks! The chios should have been 1.99 so 3 bucks for a small side of guac the was good for maybe 5 bites? C'mon. It took nearly 7 min to have the order taken after the person in front of me had been helped. The workers behind the counter do not speak up so you can hear them. So one order got red sauce only when Christmas was asked for. In the end, that was okay. The tomatillo sauce as well as the red sauce was nothing to rave about. Too much of a tangy taste to the green sauce and the red sauce tasted like it had been cooked too long. Honestly, their take on enchiladas was terrible. However, the chips were good and tye guac was over loaded in salt and lemon.",

You make choices of what goes on your enchiladas from the scratch made corn or flour tortillas, endless options of meat or non meat toppings and finishing toppings. I was impressed that the tortillas where being hand pressed at my order. They  have \"50/50\" tortilla (half corn/half flour) which was good choice with the meat fillings to hold against the sauce that goes on top. There are so many fillings to choose from and you can choose two different meats. After my enchiladas were filled they were placed in wood fire oven to toast up a little bit. I would caution on putting too many salsas on top as it gets little soggy but have fun and explore the different options. Overall I was very pleased with the quality of food and will spread the word about this new place in area.",

    "text": "I would consider this a higher-end Chipotle, with the caveat that Gadzooks offers enchiladas instead of burritos. (You can also get tacos, nachos, etc.) They have a fair number of protein choices, and I enjoyed the tomatillo chicken and green chili pork in my enchiladas. I loved that they offer half corn/half flour tortillas that they make in-house. Best of all is that Gadzooks builds your dine-in entree in a nice piece of crockery which heats your entree to a nice bubbly, hot finish that stays warm for awhile. There are numerous sauces and toppings to add to your meal as well. All in all it was a good find!",

I'm pleased they have a vegan option to begin with. It's a spinach mushroom saute, with corn flour tortillas (some of the best I've ever had), and green sauce. The allergen menu isn't completely labeled, as they forgot to add it on a few items.  I added all the salsas and the deliciously pickled red onions.   I half expected it to be dry based off of how long it took to pay for my food and wait to dress it. I think that the wait is a little too long right now to be a good lunch spot (45 minutes for two people to go through the line) but eventually it will die down and they'll find a better groove for the flow. It was a bit of a mess paying for my food before putting on the toppings? What if someone changes their mind and wants something on top that costs extra?   My gripe is the amount food I got for the price. One thing that will cause me to go to chipotle over going here is the lack of free quac for a vegan enchilada. No cheese and no meat and I still have to pay $2 for quac? No thanks. Make the vegan potatoes an option during a week and I'd understand a little more.",

We tried tacos and enchiladas with combinations we wouldn't have made on our own. Delicious! We traded half-way through so we could each have more tastes. Imagine my dismay when hours later, I couldn't find my purse. After retracing my steps, I thought I must have left it at Gadzooks. A quick phone call verified my fear. We went to retrieve it, and everyone was so nice and generous. The employees are so delightful and engaged. They have two new dedicated customers...great food and great humanity.

The location is great and the interior was fun/trendy. To my surprise I walked in and noticed it was chipotle style (embarrassed to refer to chipotle in this review because it blows chipotle out of the water).   To start, the girl cooking the tortillas knows what she is doing, she was friendly, fun, and extremely knowledgeable. The tortilla was so fresh and crisp that made you want to just get an extra one on the side to eat.  The rest of the staff was seasoned and excellent as well, they explained everything and were smiling while doing it! I was shocked at the customer service at this place and will keep coming for the food and the service.  I got three enchiladas: pork shoulder, chicken/cornbread, and braised short ribs - literally excellent... I probably wouldn't get the chicken again and just do the cornbread... the pork shoulder and braised short ribs were outstanding.   Excellent job to this staff and owner. Welcome to the neighborhood!!!",

Well, that day arrived when we had to eat from Gadzooks, not necessarily dining in, but we decided to order for take out. The ordering process was excruciatingly awkward as the manager kept asking over and over how I wanted my order despite of my polite and yet loudly-articulate voice.   I understand dealing with customers who are not really familiar with your food could be a bit draining, and that's why I jokingly warned the manager (who was the person taking my order) that it was \"my first time at the restaurant\" and to \"please bear with me\" but she quickly got annoyed and brushed me off to the nice young men working with her at the moment.   To be my first at this place, not the best experience. Me and my family enjoyed the food, I just wish my first time was one that was pleasant and that I felt appreciated. I mean, we shouldn't demand to be \"appreciated\" but if you're a patron who want impolite and you're trying out a new place, that's the least we expect.",

    "text": "This is my second visit to Gadzooks and I am still as impressed as I was the first time. I just love this concept of building your own enchilada since everyone has different likes and dislikes when it comes to food! I ordered 2 enchiladas (one with the chicken and one with the short ribs) with the red sauce and both types of cheese. (I got the Christmas style last time which gives you both red and green sauce, but the green sauce was way too tangy for me). I got pico, salsa verde, habanero lava, and the slaw for my toppings.  My boyfriend ordered 2 enchiladas with red sauce as well (one with chicken and one with pork shoulder). He topped his with pico, guacamole (1.65 extra), slaw, and crema. This was his first time trying Gadzooks and he loved it!  If you look at the size of the enchiladas and think that it isn't going to be enough, don't worry! They fill the enchiladas up with the meat, so I think they are very filling. I also opted for the half flour and half corn tortillas which are delicious and hold up well to the sauce and filling.  I definitely want to come back to try some of the other fillings. I have also tried the cornbread, which is so so good!! It's both sweet and spicy in the perfect balance! The next filling I want to try is the bison. If you're visiting from out of town, definitely give this place a try!",

It's set up was similar to Chipolte, after choosing the protein, you also get to choose what goes inside your enchilada before they heat it up in the oven, like Subway. After it is warmed up, you also get to add the finishing touches. We both ordered soda, $2 and $2 for pumpkin cookie (2 to an order).  There was a group of 20+ individuals having their dinner and the noise was bouncing off the walls, so noisy and irritating. Was glad when we sat down that they had finished their meals and departed. Need to do something with the acoustics.  We will definitely be back.",

Can't miss is as its just east of 40th st and camelback road. The invention of a enchilada pick as you create your enchiladas similar to chipotle is ideal! They do also serve tacos, salads and soups!  Since it was my first visit had to go with the staple flour enchiladas with chicken and barbacoa(short rib). Once you select the tortilla, select the meat, then any topping mixed with a select cheese that then gets put into an oven for a quick bake. The end product is melted cheese with fresh flavors inside. They also have two style of margarita drink machines and a variety of Mexican beers. I went with a grapefruit margarita and unsweetened ice tea. Can't wait to visit next and try our the other varieties of meats and cheeses they have to offer !",

They serve coke products.  2 enchiladas for 8. You can add a 3rd for 3.  2 is plenty for anyone. Next time I may add 1 and split with my wife. One in our party got the nachos, they looked great.  We got the cookies, they are link in, made on site. Excellent. On top of everything they serve coke products my fav.",

    "text": "Mexican food is a dime a dozen in the Valley.  Sometimes you're down to sit down at a fancy restaurant, wait an hour and eat your food slowly and savor it.  Other times, you're in a hurry and want good food fast.  Gadzooks is the latter kind of Mexican food joint.  Fast, tasty, and worth the drive if you are in the mood for something different.  The specialty of Gadzooks is the enchilada--and boy howdy they are right.  Though you can pick tacos, I wholeheartedly recommend getting the enchiladas.  I've tried all of their meats except for the bison.  You can't go wrong with any choice, though the tomatillo chicken and short rib are particular stand-outs.  There are also vegetarian and gluten-free options available.  Add in your choices of red or green sauce (pro-tip: you can go Christmas style and get a bit of both on your meal), several salsas and some fresh cheeses and toppings.  A few minutes in the oven and you're ready to eat.  The speed and taste of Gadzooks are great-you'll go from ordering to eating in about 7 minutes or so.  The chips and salsa are probably the stars of the show, though.  These are not your run-of-the-mill tortilla chips.  These are thick, well salted always served warm.  You'll find that they are the perfect delivery vehicle for one of their several salsas.    I'm not a fan of tea, but my sister is.  She loved their sweet tea, wishing that they happened to sell it by the gallon.    Special notice goes out to Joshua, the manager on duty.  All of the employees were helpful but Joshua went above and beyond, making fresh chips and bringing them out to the table for my party to enjoy.  He also took the time to explain the options that we were to choose from.  I drive for Uber and I am usually in the area.  The next time I get a craving, I'll be coming back to Gadzooks.",

I have heard so many rave reviews about this establishment and they were consistent throughout all locations, today I tried Camelback.  The Good the bad and the ugly ...  The good or fantastic - was the concept, quality of food and service; I mean this was run like a well oiled machine that had my taste buds exploding from the smell when I walked in.  The food did not disappoint- by far the best I have ever had and what's good food without superb hospitality?  Well they were both equal; the Manager Paige was AMAAAAAZING...  CLEANLINESS FOR ME SAYS IT ALL AND THIS PLACE GOWS OVER AND ABOVE..   The bad and ugly;  WELL GREAT NEWS, THIS ESTABLISHMENT IS 5 STARS  everything was perfect.  Can't wait to visit Arcadia again some killer Enchiladas again.   Great job !!!",

We visited our cousins in Arizona for a long weekend and because I saw there are some pretty good reviews for this place, we decided to pay this place a visit.    Yes about the chipotle like- You basically go stand in line. And then choose your protein and ingredients, then they put the enchilada in the fire for cooking.  Got both red and green salsa, and wasn't disappointed! The portions were good for the dollars, and plus they have kids options as well.   My cousins were really happy about this place too, and said that next time someone comes to visit from out of town they will take them here.",

They have fixins to go with your selections that make them stand out and bound to enhance your dishes. Like the sweet & spicy cornbread and scratch made crema or the pickled onions...    The portions are generous and well balanced. The fact that they serve short ribs meat all the time for enchiladas and tacos, that's already a huge win!  Tip:  Make sure you take your time through the line if it's your first time, these guys are super nice and will help you understand how to best order something you will love.  Must Try: The Festival Tacos, as is.  Bon Ap!  T",

With a simple menu, quality ingredients, and an array of toppings for tacos, enchiladas and soup!   I have driven by Gadzooks a million times, and finally stoped in!  I haven't heard much about it, so I'm hoping to get the word out! It's so DELICIOUS!   It goes like this... if you're having these amazing enchiladas or tacos, you choose the protein, corn or flour tortillas, next, the amazing enchiladas sauce, red, green or both! (Like I did!) The enchiladas are served up in a stone dish, then places in a hot open fire!  Once out, you choose your toppings, from the assembly line of goodies!  Extras, are served a'la cart, so you'll spend extra on guacamole, chips and salsa, and sides. But the value is there! I promise you won't go away hungry!   These guys are accommodating, so if your feeling low carb, then do without the tortilla's and make a bowl, lots of greens to choose from! (But, really, splurge, it's worth the extra exercise time!)   So happy I finally stopped at Gadzooks!",

We came around 3pm on a Saturday and it was dead. We were the only patrons there. I know it's an off hour but even on the weekend seemed a little odd.   The ordering process is outlined with options written on the board over the counter. It is a little odd though. You assemble your enchilada base, then pay, then add toppings. I know this allows the time needed for the food to cook in between but no one really explained how it worked so it was quite the awkward ordering process. We also kept having to repeat ourselves even though neither of us speak quietly. Just felt really awkward.   For two meals and one drink our total was about $22. I had pork enchiladas with red sauce, cheese, pico and crema. My girlfriend got two chicken street tacos. Honestly our food was not great... I thought the pork was pretty flavorless. Neither of us were fans of the tortillas either. I know this may be a bit user error since you are creating your own concoction but I still found it to be very blah. Neither of us had any interest in returning at the end of our meal.   It's a really cute spot but unfortunately I just don't understand the hype.",

When I order or dine here I usually get the salad with chicken or pork, add in a mix of cheeses with several toppings (pickled onions, honey slaw, guacamole, tortilla strips, cotija cheese, etc). Every time I've ordered this I've been very satisfied! Beyond the salads, my friends that have visited with me have tried the soup and their enchiladas and they say the same thing, \"When can we eat at Gadzooks again?!\"   Before I end this review I must tell you to try the cookies. They are pumpkin cookies with brown sugar glaze on top. I'm not even a pumpkin flavor fan but the fluffy cookie has quickly become my favorite and has made me re-consider trying all other pumpkin flavor items. Every single person that I know that has tried them loves them! I ordered cookies to go so I could bring some back to the office and they were gone in seconds! Everyone asked, \"What are these and where did you get them?\"   I guess you could say I'm a fan - go try it out for yourself!",

I added the cornbread after seeing it as an option.. looked like stuffing with roasted corn .. then they put the whole plate in a pizza like oven .. I asked for a fountain drink and paid and found a table .. waited for them to call me ..  Turns out once it comes out of the oven you can pile on more toppings ... the young man at the counter had to lean out and call me over so I could finish my order.. oops! He asked if it was my first time and then explained how the toppings worked ..  I went with salsa and honey slaw .. there were a ton of extras - dressing, cheese, salsa, lettuce, etc   The food was soo good.. the corn tortilla was delicious even though it was under all the toppings.. the flavor was good! The meat and toppings were all seasoned well.. the oven put a little crust on top and melted the cheese .. yum!!

Doesn't take much longer than Chipotle remarkably to get your enchiladas, even though there is a step in the middle where they throw it in a gas oven to melt and blend all the ingredients.  I have yet to taste any combos I don't like, whether meat or vegetarian.  I usually get the 50/50 corn/flour tortillas, the short rib filling, and all the free toppings. I add a mix of the cheese, and some medium salsa and sour cream.  For $8.50 you get a pretty filling little meal.  For less than $15, you can get enchiladas, chips salsa and a little cup of guac, and a drink.  The chips are NOT as good as Chipotle, but are serviceable.  I think the price point is about right.  It's neither cheap nor expensive.  My only real downside is that the food tastes excessively salty to me.  Kind of hides the flavors.  I always end up guzzling water for the next day after eating there.  By the way, this place is very vegetarian friendly, with lots of great options!  And yeah, the cookies 2 for under $2, are actually worth buying, even if just to take home.",

Their staff is cool and their presentation is awesome. Love how clean and new everything is. Their menu functions as a build your own enchilada or taco (or salad) and you watch them cook the tortillas right in-front of you. That's half the reason they're so damn good, because the tortillas are uber fresh and supah good.   The chicken and beef are great, same with both the red and green sauce. I also wish i had more cornbread for the road!",

    "text": "To the people in Phoenix, Gadzooks means fast-casual assembly line enchiladas. But to me, Gadzooks will always be synonymous with cool 90s kids that had a bit of \"edge\" to their fashion sense. I'm sure some of you know what I'm talking about. Especially if you grew up frequenting retail malls back when teens did such things.  Anyway, I've visited the original Gadzooks location a few times before I started writing reviews and never had any complaints. But since this second location opened up, I've always been meaning to give them a try.  Now, in most cases, I usually just roll my eyes at these types of \"concept\" places that remind me of the hundreds of subpar pizza joints that keep opening up all over the city. But taking this trendy and tired approach in the form of enchiladas, you say? This isn't something that's entirely too common (at least not yet).  The menu itself is a bit overwhelming. There are a lot of options. Probably too many, in fact. I also wish they at least had a handful of their own creations that people can try, rather than just making it a total free-for-all where you can just do whatever you want. Building your own is fine, but I've always enjoyed the process of experimenting with chef-driven creations. Sadly, you won't find that here.  Minor gripes aside, what they serve here is actually very good and it sounds like most people agree. I keep wanting to try their bison, but it's currently restricted to lunch hours. But in terms of their pork and short rib, as well as whatever other ingredients you wish to add, I was quite pleased. Everything is decent quality and far superior to what you'd find at a lot of cookie cutter Mexican restaurants in the city. For that, I give them some serious credit.   My girlfriend, who is insanely picky about her enchilada quality, was happy with hers. As was I. And I'm sure with further experimenting, I could probably create something even better since I'm kind of on my own in this regard.  Recommended!",

Went with the chicken and short rib version of the enchiladas. Topped off with cheese, red sauce, pico de gallo and red onions. It was a good lunch for about 9 bucks, but just not blown away by this concept anymore.",

    "text": "The pictures of this place looked amazing and really it didn't let me down. So many ways you can get enchiladas and I'm not sure if you could go wrong any way you make the enchiladas. This location is one of two in the Phoenix area. Really nicely designed location but a very small parking lot. I went there for lunch and all the parking spots were gone so I parked across the street. Super packed but mellowed out after the rush.   When I looked at the pictures, I had to try this spot out. Who doesn't love enchiladas!? I can't think of anyone who doesn't! The great thing about gadzooks is they specialize in a wide range of build your own enchiladas but they do have Nacho's, tacos, soups and salads.Plenty of ways to eat delicious food.   First impression when I got up to the order counter, they make their own tortillas fresh. Its kind of interesting cause you order corn or 50/50 corn flour tortillas. Never heard or a mix tortilla like that but love to see a restaurant make fresh tortillas. They have plenty of options that are vegetarian to various meat and ended up going with the short rib. They added a nice amount of meat in each of the enchiladas so expect a full meal. They have a few different sauces from mild to hot. I went with the Christmas so I can have the green and red. After the sauces they added a ton of cheese to cook the enchiladas in a huge oven. After they take the enchiladas out, they have a whole topping bar where you can get options suchs delicious slaw, cheese, picked onions, avocado to just add to the size of the meal. I do think the ordering process is kind of long and a little disorganized. I think it should from beginning to end the process of making the enchilada vs right in the middle pay for the enchiladas then add the toppings. Just seems like there's a better way to make it a smoother process.  Now getting to the taste, it's all around delicious! Like I said, it's very filling but really very good. I love the amount of cheese on top of the enchiladas with the short rib within. So good! The toppings to me ended up being a very good touch to the enchiladas. I really enjoyed the pickled onions and the red sauce. The onions add nice touch of vinegar and crunch to the meal. One of let downs was the tortillas. Maybe it's my preference, but I would of liked the tortilla to be a bit thicker. I didn't even feel like there was a tortilla since they are so thin. I'll probably go with the corn tortillas next time since they looked thicker  All in all, super good food and very filling. Gadzooks has so many options that work for anyone so I'm looking forward to coming!",

I had all corn tortillas and he made them fresh for me.  Husband had short rib and bison.  Loaded with cheeses and I had the LaCrema topping. Husband had pickled onions and honey slaw.  One beer and one soft drink.  It was delicious!!!  You must go!!! It's a great concept.  Spotlessly clean. Great friendly employees!!  And were playing \" Baby it's cold outside\"!! I love it!!!

We went in tonight about 15 minutes before closing and they might have well told us to leave. All blank stares, horrible attitudes and went out of their way to make it uncomfortable. The only thing worse than how we were treated was the poor guys that showed up a few minutes later. It was their first time at this restaurant and based on what they experienced...it will be the last.

The flavors were bad, there was no texture, everything was mush, and it was ridiculously overpriced for what it was.   FOOD WAS TOTALLY GROSS!!!",

The flavor is there many vegetation options which I love and many different sauce choices. I love sauce! I love being able to choose just what you want. Great place too the patio is great and I love that they have a walk up window. Check it out. There are 2 locations I've been to both and they are consistent.",

The food is fast casual, picking each ingredient and topping as you go. Make sure to get a friend egg in top if your enchiladas! The chicken tortilla soup is more like a stew and is heavenly.   Every day they do a speciality meat, but it's limited so you have to show up early! It's worth it.   Great vegetarian options as well.",

The server had on gloves, took cash and then rubbed his face and hands with the gloves still on before asking what we wanted.  Once we ordered three people behind us had there food remade we were told and so ours sat idly while they made theirs. We got our food but they forgot half of it then begrudgingly gave us the rest of our food. We sat down and ate this one note, no real flavor slop of an enchilada. We are One and Done!  Awful food!!!!  Horrible service. Maybe there should be someone over the age of 16 managing the incompetence on a Saturday night. Don't eat here!!!!!!",

There were a few people ahead of me in line, but they were very efficient and it was just a few minutes before my enchilada was coming out of the oven. I liked that they let me make my two enchiladas different so I could try more options (filling, sauce, and cheese).  They came out of the oven sizzling and I added salsa verde, pico, and cheese.  It's rare that I finish all my food and I was scraping the dish clean.  Also snagged some pumpkin cookies to go. They're soft and pumpkin-y with a delicious icing.  Everyone should definitely give this place a try!",
