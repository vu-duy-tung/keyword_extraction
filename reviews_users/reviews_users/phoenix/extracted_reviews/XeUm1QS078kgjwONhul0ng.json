    "text": "I have only had lunch at Pino's so my review is limited.  However I have had lunch there over 50 times in the past 9 years.  Positives, locaton, quick, hot greasy slices, decent sauce and cheese blend.  A good fold type of slice. Clean and bright with big windows facing Thomas. You can be in and out in 20 minutes pre or post 12 Noon.  Negatives -  Cash only - feel free to use the atm with $3 + service charge.  Overpriced across the board.  Avoid the stuffed chicken parm slice, inside is a mystery breading with little to no chicken. Charging extra for a side of sauce when the chicken parm subs come with 1 drop of sauce - lame.   Avoid these items like the plague.    Negatives continued - Ordering a soda means the 48 ounce guzzler.  You must order a small (in a to go cup) otherwise you get a prepoured extra large.  Considering they frown upon free (see rude below) refills if you drink a lot of soda the 48z may be for you.  On a serious note.  Ownership and staff is mildly rude.  Counter staff turns over frequently.  Likely because the owner scrowls and jaws and hawks over the cash register.  Having been here as much as I have I can't recall ever hearing a welcome to pino's or have a nice day.  Ever.    Bottom line here seems more about getting your money than atmosphere, service or attention to detail.    Bottom line = A decent enough slice for lunch.",

    "text": "Man, where to begin? First off I will start by saying that you should not be put off by the service staff initially, they are all quirky and unique which sometimes gets misinterpreted, especially when you are used to robot waiters. With that being said, pretty much anything you get from here is amazing. I usually get the pizza Margherita, which is simple, just cheese, sauce, and basil leaves (yum!). The crust comes out nice and crispy but still slightly malleable, so when you pick up a slice it holds its own weight until the very tip drips down with oodles of cheese going everywhere, the slice is begging to be devoured! If I'm not in the mood for margherita, I'll grab a sicillian slice, and WOW talk about next level awesome sicillian. You are lucky if you ever taste anything like this in your existence. If I don't want pizza period...then I'll go with the spaghetti and meat sauce, or the pasta primavera.   Also if you get a chance, Pino is a really awesome dude too, probably one of the nicest guys I've met, I'm not sure if he actually remembers who I am when I come in, but he definitely greets me like he does :) and also he is extremely passionate about his food, and because of that he gets the 5 star rating.",

When I said something about wanting more vegetarian options the reply was \"we'll make it work! just let us know.\" There is no Alfredo on the menu, but the waiter guaranteed that it'd be no problem for them to make. The 4 formaggi pizza was fantastic. The spaghetti is great, so is the cal-zone. Everything on the menu is served with good sized portions, enough so that I have leftovers. Which is awesome as I am the queen of leftovers.  I highly recommend this place and if you want something not on the menu ask, they are more than willing to accommodate.",

The order came out very quickly and the waiter was very attentive and even threw in a bit of cheesy humor for measure.

After having a buddy recommend this place due to a raving review of a lamb dish, I finally decided to give it a try.   When you walk in you can just smell the aroma of fresh marinara sauce. For me, that's always the first test - does the place have a good red sauce or not? Well after plowing through the linguini side that accompanied some of the best pork chops I've ever had, I can say \"mamma Mia!!\" (and not to Abba tunes mind you, more like to That's amore).   The special that I chose was 2 pork chops in a gorgonzola cream sauce that I found greatly enjoyable. The pork was cooked thorougly, and still moist.   I can also say that the otger staples are highly enjoyable - fresh mozzarella and meatballs get an A+, as well as some of the crispiest salad I've had in a long time (barring my weekly trips to the farmers market).   Go and mangia!",

Italian owner Pino is always smiling and welcoming his second family, his guest.    The Menu definitely has it's New York flavor with just a simple folded paper with all the items.  His Pizza's are delicious try something different every time you will not be dissapointed.  One of Pino's specialty pizza's is the Pinos Pasta Pizza a very interesting pie that packs the carbs, but you will want it all the time.  Calzones... What can I say about them?  I will put anyone up against Pino's!  His calzones are simply amazing.  You can mix and match them to your liking.  His ingredients are superb!  If you like Prosciutto Di Parma make sure its on your calzone with some tomatoes, fontina cheese and he will do the rest.  I can talk about this place for hours.... I have been a longtime customer and Pino is working on helping me with my Italian after all the visits I have made.    Parking is tuff so be ready to walk.  His place is small and cozy he does have some servers that can occasionally need a kick but the food and some good wine will erase that thought pretty quickly.   Buona Fortuna",

    "text": "how in the WORLD does this place get a 5???  Like a good little planner, I called 30 minutes ahead of my intended pick up time, it was after all 1pm I thought maybe there'd be a lingering lunch crowd so I wanted to give them ample time. Arrived to an almost full parking lot so I thought wow I'm glad I called it in. well there are no rewards here for that! Upon entering, what seemed to be the assistant manager or at least the alpha of the cashiers told me to 'step aside over here' because I was a pick up. Then in the next moment she says oh actually go ahead & get in line. I look to my right & see a line of, not making this up, no less than 13 people. Excuse me??? I said, isn't this why you call in an order, to avoid this? to which she said \"well we just want to make it fair\". Whaaaattt????? oh i'm sorry i didn't know this was the USSR bread line version of pizza joints. maybe they should call this place Politically Correct Pizza, instead of Pino's Pizza. In economic times like these, you are just plain stupid if your company misses the customer service beat. I will NEVER go back to this place. Now, you're probably wondering, but what the pizza good? tasted like a rubbery triscuit & $23 for 2 truly small pizzas (smalls at other joints are not THIS small, geesh). their crust is absolutely horrible, it's a painful ripoff of cibo or bianco but doesn't even come close! what a trainwreck.....",

    "text": "Nice, simple pizza place on Thomas near Central...makes for a good lunch for those of us that work downtown and need to get out of the office occasionally for lunch. The inside is bigger than I thought it would be and it's very simple, which is fine.  There are a few tables outside as well.  The parking lot out front is TINY, but supposedly you can park around back as well. We parked in front of the CPA's office next door with no problems.  Although I didn't see it advertised anywhere and it's not listed in the menu I took with me, you can buy pizza by the slice, which is very important for me to rate a place as a good pizza joint.  Secondly, my slice of cheese was under $2...another plus.  The slice was large, greasy without being too greasy, and had a healthy ratio of cheese to sauce.  I also ordered a caesar salad...it was large enough so that I could have ate just that for lunch. The only negative was that for the size of the salad, it didn't have enough dressing.  The speciality salad for the day looked delicious and my two co-workers who ordered it really enjoyed it.  For my salad, slice of cheese pizza, and soda, my bill was $10.  Service was quick and Pino's offers call ahead and delivery for those that can't enjoy a leisurely lunch.",

I'm a fan of simple pizza: not too much sauce, lots of cheese, and a great crust.  Pino's offers just that.

We got the Bruschetta to start as an appetizer that we decided to send back because of the awful taste. We ordered a Margherita Pizza and a Penne Primavera Pasta. To say the least, My husband and friend got sick from the pizza right after eating. The pizza was extra greasy. Puddles of grease formed in the bowled shaped pepperoni. My pasta was hard, greasy and soaked in sauce-not tasty.    The highlight of the night was when it came time to pay -they had included a charge for the appetizer that I had sent back and no longer was at our table. When I asked the Waiter about the charge of the appetizer,  the waiter answered verbatim, \"of course I charged you for the appetizer,  otherwise people would come here all the time order, send it back  and not expect to pay for anything,\" he was very loud and angry.  So there you have it --horrible service and food!!",

To start off I was encouraged they used the exact same pizza ovens as the places I like in NY, not some conveyor belt pizza over. The crust is tossed, not pressed, and well done is the way the pizza is done.  From the online menu you may not know they sell pizza by the slice. Cheese slices are $2.50 + .50 per topping, but why mess with a good thing. Sicilian squares are $3.50 and stuffed pizza is $3.95  The cheese slice was great, the crust was crisp, the cheese was rich yet done enough to have some of the oils separate, the sauce was flavorful and not sweet and there was a hint of basil.  The Sicilian slice was great to with a True twice baked crust, and just more of all of the great flavors of the cheese slice.  The stuffed veggie pizza was good two. Like a mini Calzone sans  cheese, the crust was crisp on the outside and moist on the inside the filling was subtle but fresh.  Their menu also had pastas, salads and sandwitches. I must come back to try the pastas too.   During lunch one orders at a counter and then picks up the food from the counter when your number is called.     Bottom line, great pizza with out the crazy waits or prices at other good pizza places in AZ.",

    "text": "Pino Martino owner of Pino's Pizza al Centro, immigrated to Phoenix from Basilicata, Italy approximately 30 years ago.   Pino's specializes in Italian and New York pies with their signature thin crust. He also offers delicious specialty pizzas. Pizza is available by the pie or by the slice. It's the perfect spot for lunch or dinner. If you prefer an authentic calzone, Pino's is the place to get one. In all his dishes, Chef Martino uses only the best and freshest ingredients. He makes his own sausage and never uses the likes of canned tomato sauce or puree.  If you prefer a sandwich or a salad, you'll find a nice variety to choose from. I especially like the caprese made of fresh mozzarella and basil. The thought of the Italiano panini made with Pino's home made Italian dressing and imported prosciutto, makes my mouth water.  Chef Martino, himself, is always in the kitchen. If you go when it's not meal time, he might even have a moment to stop by your table and tell you some True tales of Italy.   I LOVE Pinos!",

    "text": "absolutely awful service.  Eaten here for 20 years and cannot believe they can't get a simple pizza order right.  Sat there waiting for ONE hour for the pizza, took it home and open the box and got a vegetarian pizza (I ordered the meat lovers).  Tried to reach them on the phone, waited 5 minutes, got hung up on called back and finally got the rude cashier who took my order.  No apologies, nothing.  Just Oh there must of been a mix up in the kitchen!    Drove back over there and she pushed the money in my hand (DIDN'T GET MY TIP BACK THOUGH!) and again uttered excuses about the kitchen making a mistake.  Never will go back.  this is the SECOND time they haven't been able to produce a correct order.  My time is valuable and I wasted 1.5 hours waiting on a pizza for nothing.  Very disappointed in the service and ATTITUDE of the cashier.",

I'm from the east coast and I have always searched for good east cost tasting pizza. It's all about the crust and Pinos crust is thin, chewy and charred. It's wonderful! And the Marianna is to die for. So far, I have tried their pizza and their calzones, both excellent. However if you get pepperoni and sausage, it's a little greasy, but it's pepperoni and sausage, so what do you expect. Thanks, Pinos for giving me a reason to go into the office :)",

    "text": "After our first choice for Pizza turned out to be unfortunately very closed, we decided to head up the street to give this place a shot.  Possibly because it is located a couple miles down the street, this place always seems to be mentioned along with Pizza A Metro, so obviously I was more than willing to give Pino's a shot.  What unfolded was a very average experience.  None of the pies looked particularly interesting; I went with the vegetarian.  It was basically a step above a Barro's supreme pizza as far as toppings are concerned.  The crust was better than what you would get at a pizza chain, but it was a little harder than it should be, and somewhat lacking in flavor.  Nothing seems particularly bad, just underwhelming.  Not to mention, it cost almost $20 for a pizza and a drink.  A little steep for that neighborhood, I think.  It's really difficult to justify ever going back here when Pizza A Metro is just down the street.",

    "text": "Went here today for lunch after not being here in like 15-20 years.  This place has been around awhile just like Johnny's Red Hots and First Watch.  Others in the area are mostly new-comers and chains.  Pino's was great then and still is!   The front parking was full as were most of the tables with local business people, firemen, cops, etc.  I ordered a couple of slices, one cheese, one with pepperoni and black olives.  They were both fantastic.  The crust was delicious and the flavor of the sauce and the pepperoni was outstanding.    I'm not sure what the previous reviewer Kris M was talking about.  This place is authentic.  The place Kris refers to a couple of buildings down (Z-pizza) is not.   Don't get me wrong - Z has it's place but anyone over the age of 14 knows the difference between authentic Italian and a funky California based chain.  As for the pepperoni, they use an authentic aged and cured pepperoni, not some packaged and processed American version of pepperoni.  And as for Kris M making fun of the name, IT'S THE GUY'S NAME!!  Seriously, how immature are you to make fun of someone's name???  It's a common Italian fist name.  Grow up!!  Like the previous reviewer said - try them yourselves!  If you're looking for authentic Italian, you won't be disappointed!",

    "text": "I finally decided to stop by this unassuming, petite, yet charming Italian joint for a quick lunch.  What impressed me the most about their pizza was how the crust was thin, soft, and airy.  I typically look for a gooooood crust and Pino's did not disappoint.  I might in fact enjoy the crust more than the toppings themselves.    I thought the sauce tasted fresh and light while the cheese and pepperoni maintained that greasy consistency that you see at a lot of places.  Do not let the outside appearance of Pino's fool you as the interior decor makes up a lot for the limited parking space and simple exterior design.  As someone who has seen it all, from Paris to New York, I very much appreciated the essence of Italian art being incorporated into the walls that surround the contemporary dining room.  What I liked especially were the exposed, red bricks near the ordering counter, the fancy column structures and classy lighting that made you feel you were dining at a ritzy ristorante!   Being that it was my first time here, I will definitely venture to more items on the menu such as their panini and pasta entrees.  I have a feeling they will be just as pleasing as what I had today.  The best part was paying under $7 [1 Topping Slice + Bag of Chips + 1 Lg Drink].  So for the simplicity in taste and quality with a touch of Italian culture, Pino's has made it into my lunch rotation.",

Pino is usually there, cooking away in the kitchen, but he remembers us and always comments about \"not seeing us in a while\" or how we \"came all this way for pizza!\" Because we don't really live close to the downtown area /: Still, we really love this style of pizza and we love buying a loaf of homemade bread before we head home!",

Things to know when dining-in : They are pretty stingy with silverware and napkins when you dine-in. They charge you for anything extra, sauce, dressing, butter, cheese or parmesan cheese to go, drink re-fills.  Thing to know when placing an order to go: I placed a deliver order for two large pizzas for my office. When they delivered the pizza they did not bring any parmesan cheese or peppers. The delivery person told me they never carry any with them. When I called Pino's they informed me that they only provide it if you request it when you are placing your order. Seriously!! You are delivering to an office someone is bound to want parmesan cheese and peppers. I called to speak to a manager but she wasn't there. They said she would call me back within 24 hours. Still no call.   If you dine-in or order to go know that you need to request everything!!!!! I wanted to give 2.5 stars but you can only give whole stars. Food is good but service ehhh.",

Update: the pizza is still great, but customer service is one of the worst I've ever seen. Any specifications that you may request are \"too hard\" for them to do.   I requested a large pepperoni pizza and asked them to leave a little area without pepperoni and put some mushrooms on a  little area because I needed just a slice for it vegetarian friend. I was told that's too hard to do because they cut the pizza after it is baked.  I didn't need it to be a perfect slice of mushroom. It's not rocket science. So, I decided to order a calzone with mushroom for my friend. It was $42 for a large pepperoni pizza and a calzone. I'm assuming that included delivery, but seriously, how much can delivery be to go 2 blocks and then throw a tip on there, it would be $50. This place has no concept of customer service and when you ask to talk to the owner, they make excuses as to why you can't. I work at a nearby hospital and have introduced many people to Pino's pizza and they've gotten a lot of business from us. I am passing along my experiences and discouraging the people, that I once encouraged , from giving them anymore business. So disappointed Pino because you do make a great pizza.",

Last time we dined in we had an awkward experience where one of the meals wasn't anything close to expectations, we hadn't eaten more than a bite of the dish - we shared our feedback with the waiter - in a really nice way with the waiter. He was sincere in saying sorry and asked if there was something else my wife would like instead.  They prepared the other meal, never saying 'hey, we're happy to make you something else but you will pay for both' so I was surprised to see the expense for two meals in place of one. When I spoke to the cook/manager? he didn't offer anything up, no refund of any meals, just a 'sorry'.    Ok, so I thought, no more dine in - but we'll get 'to-go'.  So tonight we order two pies, both were to have sausage, and I go to pick them up.  It's True I didn't approach it with the same attitude as I would with McDonalds or Jack so I didn't look at the pizzas.  Get home, and one of them doesn't have sausage.  We call up and the girl first hammers with questions saying she was sure it had sausage....um, yeah, one did but not both and that was the request.  So she was SUPER kind and after some dialogue said she'd credit us $1.75 for not putting the topping on.   Cracks me up because when I walked out the door, the cook/manager was sitting out front at a little bistro table and said 'thanks, I made those pizzas'....well, congrats - you sure made them...just not to what the customer specs were.",

The pizza isn't the best in town, but we were fond of the service and neighborhood-y atmosphere (friendly, casual). The last 4 times we've been there over the past few months, the service has been actually awful.   Once we had a new waitress, who said it was her first day as a waitress, for which I felt bad because...why wasn't anyone training her?! Last time, the waitress was actually rude, and barely checked on us, even though we would have ordered more if she had. Her loss, Pino's loss.  Used to feel like an old friend. Sadly, no more. Not sure we'll ever go back, because you want to feel welcome when you frequent a place.  If you do go, I recommend a plain cheese or quattro fromaggi pizza or the lasagna, which is often on special.   Oh, they used to serve budweiser (regular, not light) in frosted glasses, and there was something old fashioned and delicious in it, but they don't seem to do that anymore either.   There is also one great Italian waiter, but we never get him anymore. I guess we're not good enough to get real waiters?? Ha.",

We decided on Pinos tonight to try something new and support a small business. Instead we went home hungry and angry. It is highly likely in a city this size that we will find a different establishment next time we get a craving for pizza.",

With calzones, pasta, sandwiches, salads and desserts, there is something good here for everyone.  Pizza is available by the slice in both thin crust and Sicilian, however I prefer my pizza fresh, so I order a 10\" for myself.  My favorites are the Bianca, and the Carnivori.  The sandwiches are large, and enough for even the hungriest of men, but I suggest having it on the homemade focaccia bread.  The salads are huge and big enough for sharing or you'll have some to save for later.  Parking can be an issue here with only a few spots out front...But us regulars know about the hidden spots in the alley behind the building...",

I have to admit I never thought I'd ever step in this place either, let alone review it with four stars, but I am, and all thanks to a pasta loving friend and an indecisive day.  My review is based solely on their pasta primavera, which, after trying for the first time, I went back on my own to have it again. Three more times. This is huge for me.   The portion is perfect sized and the vegetables which is mainly squash heaven is just perfect. The bread that accompanies it is soft and flavorful also. It's truly the perfect dish for a non tomato/pasta lover like myself.   The staff is really friendly and always strikes up a small conversation when I come in. The prices are reasonable and for the most part, it seems fairly empty every time I've stopped in.   I don't typically crave pasta, but find myself craving this on occasion, which means it's top notch.",

Meaning, this place DOES take credit cards if your order is over $25!  A lot of other Yelpers have complained that the male owner is a little rude, and his wife (I think?) is the other owner, and she has always been okay.  I guess I am from the east coast, so they seem totally fine to me, but I can see where AZ people think they're a little gruff.  Whatever... I am not paying them to be nice-- I am paying them to cook me some awesome grub.  The best sandwich, to me, is the Italiano because it's the best prosciutto I have ever had.  The texture and quality makes it melt in your mouth.  Also, you can have this sandwich on focaccia (my friends usually choose this option) or the homemade Italian bread, which is my choice.  It's soft and that dusting of flour just makes me all Italo-happy.  It's served with uber-fresh basil as well.  There is a balsamic dressing that is usally served on top, but I ask for it on the side, as I don't like my bread to get mushy.  Finally, the sandwich is pretty big, so it's worth the $10.  (It's gotta be $10 worth of primo prosciutto alone!)  The other key choice is the pizza.  I departed from my beloved Italiano one day (but only because I had already eaten it 2 days before) and ventured toward the pizza.  I am suprised to say that it's really great!  The crust is perfect, and it's just the right amount of doughy.  My advice is to try it.  Get there at 11:30am or 1:00pm for lunch.  Carpool.  Bring cash.  Smell the air when you walk in.  Order the pizza.  Make plans to go back and try the Italiano.  ;)",

    "text": "How to roll at Pino's.  Pino's is one those increasingly rare environs in the USA, a no frills family owned restaurant. First time diners may occasionally get a dose of family dynamic's that don't fit there ethic's or social graces. Hence the occasional negative review. Few people these days understand what it means to work sun up to sun down 6 days a week to make a living. This is the reality of a family restaurant ... you can't always be at your best. I myself have never witnessed any odd behavior, and Pino is the nicest guy you'll ever meet, as is his night time wait staff.   Like many Pizzaria's in the New York area, Pino's is  a cafeteria style high volume take out environment M-F for lunch. Learn the ropes to get feed at rush hour or .. No Soup for You!  Ok I'm just having fun here but you get the idea. Afternoons are slower but I usually avoid that time period because of the limited menu. Evening's are when you want to visit for a True Pino's Al Centro experience. 5-8 PM.   My friend Matt is a regular over here and lets just say the man can eat. Though him I have learned what can really come out of this kitchen, yes some real 5 star specials. Though him I also learned of the \"Italian Style\" Margarita Pizza ... this thing is off the charts, I actually dream of eating this pie. A super huge funky shaped pizza with a super thin crust ... bubbling with gooey goodness ... Oh Baby Baby. Unfortunately its not on the menu. I myself only get one 50% of the time, and never through the wait staff although they say no problem, a \"regular\" Margarita Pizza always shows up. (Still very good but not the madman).  My only success is to ask Pino's directly, an if he's busy its not going to happen. The only reason I am sharing this is because if enough of you ask, just maybe, \"the italian pie\" becomes a permanent feature on the evening menu. My best success is Saturday's around lunch time when it's slow.  Pino's Al Centro is a 30 mile drive for me but I stop in every chance I get. Homemade everything, quality ingredients, straight forward Italian Food. Everything on the menu is a solid 4 star,  a real comfortable family style restaurant with great service and affordable pricing. What's not to like.  \"Buon appetito\"",

I also really like Pino, the person.  i met him before I had his pizza, since I run into him at Lux some mornings while I'm having coffee.  Pino really couldn't be a nicer person, and for that reason alone I would patronize his business.  But the pizza....  There's a lot of pizza in the valley, and I would dare to say there's a lot of good pizza in the valley, but when I say \"pizza,\" my family immediately begins to salivate and we all say Pino's at the same time.  I would guess there are at least fifty places to eat pizza between Pino's and my house, but I don't even bother because I know it would be disappointing by comparison.  We always have the same two things.  A giant cheese pizza and a big house salad.  it's enough to feed three skinny people with slices left over for the next day.  I once ate the rest of the pizza there, but I was both sick and happy at the same time.  I can't speak for any of the other food there and will never be able to since I will ALWAYS order his fabulous pizza.  I've been to Italy on several occasions and his pizza is just as good as any I had there.  Of course, Pino is from the old country, so he brings that love for good food with him.    I'm not sure why I'm writing this review at 11:30pm, since they are closed and now I really want a slice.  Why does Pino have to sleep?",

    "text": "***I paid with a credit card, so I'm not sure what the other reviewer is talking about...maybe there's a minimum at lunch?\"***  Family member said this place was AWESOME and had the best white pizza...told a co-worker about it.. Co-worker went and reported back it was really good. \"Better pizza than Mamma Mia, and we REALLY like Mamma Mia.\" So maybe my expectations were too high, but I wouldn't go out of my way to come back to Pino's.   Service was laid-back and friendly. Refills were frequent, no complaints on service. Our table of four ordered two caesar salads, two 10\" pizzas and one meatball sandwich.   So how was the food? Caesar salad was average. Dressing was served on the side. Normally I appreciate salad dressing on the side, but with Caesar for some reason I always want it mixed in. Quirky, I know, I'm not knocking off a star for that, but just thought I'd mention it. It came with some fresh-baked bread that was AMAZING. Sadly, that bread was the highlight of the meal.  The white pizza was VERY oily. Very. Oily. I also didn't notice that the first ingredient listed on the menu was \"fresh tomatoes\"...I know, that's my own fault, but if I'd been paying closer attention I would have asked for it without. Fresh tomatoes on pizza = gross. At least they were easy to pick off and didn't leave a \"tomato trail\" (you tomato-haters know what i'm talking about). There was nothing special about the garlic/basil/cheese on the pizza. it was somehow too much topping without being much of anything. I will say that the crust was amazing. At least the outside of it - you know, the part that wasn't completely soggy with all the oil. Did I mention the pizza was OILY?  The Carnivori pizza was their version of \"meat-lovers\". I tasted a tiny sliver of it so I shouldn't really judge, but it did nothing for me. Although I will say it was NOT oily, so at least I know that was ONLY a bi-product of the White pizza not just their general method of preparation.  The nibble of meatball sandwich I had was okay. Nothing offensive, but nothing to write home about.   Overall, this place gets a \"Meh-I've experienced better\" 2-stars. I WANT to like it more. I WANT to give it a higher rating, but something just didn't click. The breads and pizza dough are amazing (baked in-house and you can tell!).  I feel like this place has a REALLY strong foundation, and is SO CLOSE to being amazing...but they fell short.  Everything was \"okay\"...Even the oily pizza wasn't horrible. No one could complain about anything they ate...it just didn't provide any \"Mmmm...\"'s...or \"OMG - TASTE THIS!\" moments (other than the bread). I suppose if I lived or worked in the area, I'd go back and find some sandwich I liked, but it's not in my normal \"route\" and I didn't find any reason to go back. Except for the bread....I'm tempted to bump up my rating to a 3 JUST for the bread...damn that was good bread.",

    "text": "I went here last night with my girlfriend.  The Staff:  The woman at the counter was clearly put off by the fact we chose to eat at their establishment. We came in without a \"hello\", or a \"welcome\", she walked up the counter and stood there staring at us silently, waiting for us to order. We had to look at the menu first, which took about 90 seconds, she was visibly annoyed. She took our order and money without a word, or even a smile. On the way out the door I even said \"thanks much\", and still she remained silent, instead looking up briefly with what I can only call contempt, as if she was doing me some favor.   The Food:  I had the spaghetti and meatballs. The only way to describe it was sub-par. There was almost no sauce, and the meatballs tasted like they had been soaking in a Sun City hot tub since the time of biblical creation. The bread was burned, and not just a little, it was black on 3 of 4 sides.   The GF had the veggie pizza, and she said it was good. I didn't try it.   Conclusion:  I won't be giving my money to them again. Reading through the other reviews, I have to agree with Joseph S. You can get better food for less money from people who are happy to have your business.   In all, the experience was so bad that it prompted me to write my first Yelp review, but I don't know, maybe I'm just a jerk!",

A few more tidbits o' info:  the sausage is homemade, so don't hesitate to get a sausage pizza; a slice of cheese pizza is sublime, needs no toppings at all; the 4-cheese pizza is dreamy, order one; try a pizza with pesto, mozarella and ricotta, you'll weep it's so good.  Cheese steak sandwich is worth a repeat visit as well.",

They give you 1 napkin (pizza is greasy), and if you go up to the counter, they have them behind the counter so you have to wait for someone at the other end of the counter to come down to get you more than 1 napkin.  Pretty lame.  I guess napkins are expensive now???",

Mamma Mia's has better NY style and Pizza A Metro has better Roman style, but Pino's is good. The food is on the expensive side for what you get and they nickle and dime you on everything, I mean EVERYTHING. Extra sauce, dressing, red peppers, even paper plates and forks for to go orders incur a charge.   And the staff is usually on the rude side. Not quirky as one reviewer said, but just plain rude. One time they messed up my order and actually point blank refused to make me a new pizza. We ordered a large number of pizzas at work on two seperate occassions and both times they were very late delivering and not apologetic. My boss has since forbidden us to order from them. But if I'm in the mood for their brand of NY style pizza I will stop in occasionally and usually am happy with what I get.  Just be prepared to pay and get less than friendly service.",

In a lot of cases bad service is redeemable, what isn't is a rude, arrogant owner that doesn't value their customers enough to handle their complaints with maturity.  My husband and I have patronized this restaurant several times, usually the pizza is decent.That wasn't the case tonight. Instead what we received was pie that would bring any seasoned pizza-lover to tears. The entire center was a soupy, congealed mess that was completely inedible. We chalked it up to a one-time mistake and figured we could just call them up and make it right.  Called Pino's and asked the polite, young cashier if I could speak to a manager, to which she hesitantly replied, \"Um, well, my boss isn't here, but I can take a message.\" I declined, and instead explained the situation to her and asked for a refund. She then informs me that her boss IS there, in fact, he's the one that made it. She asks me to hold while she tells him. She comes back on the phone and nervously says, \"He says that the pizza is perfect and that if you want to bring the pizza back for a refund that's fine, because if he makes you another one it's going to be the same.\"   I felt so bad for this girl, she sounded so uncomfortable. Truthfully I found it pretty pathetic that he had her say it for him. And considering my husband only made it about half a slice in before declaring that it tasted as bad as it looked, I told her he'd be glad to bring it back for the refund.   When he got there, she nicely handled the transaction, and then Pino made his way to the front, opened it, barely looked at it, and then condescendingly said \"That's the way it's made, if you don't like that style, no problem\", and turned his back to my husband and just walked away. Cool, man. You seem like a really reasonable person.   Maybe Pino and Sammy from Amy's Baking Company are long lost relatives? Needless to say we wont give this place our business again.",

I ordered it with pepperoni, mushrooms, ricotta, and jalapenos. Toppings were generous though for $3.00 for EACH topping, you'd expect fresh jalapenos and NOT pickled jalapenos. The brine from the jalapenos ruined some parts of the pizza. Cheeses and pepperoni were good.   Italian Salad Fresh ingredients and homemade dressing. I don't think it's worth $12 for a salad that has veggies and no meat. I've paid less for a better salad.   All in all not a bad meal... Just super expensive for the quality and amount.",

The pasta came with lots of veggies that appeared to have been stir fried (maybe?).  There was broccoli, zucchini, cauliflower, and mushrooms.  If I come back, I will definitely order that dish again!  but the parking situation is still terrible.  I discovered they do have a few additional spots behind their restaurant, but it's pretty scary navigating that alley back there with cars coming and going in both directions as well as people taking out the trash.  you just have to go veeerrry slowly and carefully.",

After trying to decide between slices or whole pizzas, we felt like we annoyed Pino's wife. She had an attitude because we were confused about our order. She seemed annoyed that we were even there. The other people behind the counter were also not very welcoming. We weren't asked if our food was good or if we needed anything else. It was uncomfortable. As we left, Pino actually came out and said goodbye. He was the only pleasant person there today.",

The penne primavera is so good too! P.S. They DO accept credit cards, just not American Express, which sucks because that is the credit card I have for my work so we don't come here nearly as often as I would like to. Also, I've only done take-out orders so I don't know about the service at lunchtime, however the parking situation is really bad!",

I called in, and the guys were very helpful when handling my menuless call.    Upon arriving, they had my pizza ready and were very friendly.  I took it to go and was eager to try it because it smelled heavenly.  I tried the margerita and found it to be oh, so good. I found the ingredients to be of excellent quality.  Delicious cheese, fresh basil, and firm (i.e. not slimy) tomatoes.  The crust was just right- a yeasty, crispy, tender-chewy kind of yum.  Mmmmm...  I savored my slice like it was the last pizza on earth.  Thanks Pinos!  To hell with the bad reviews, your pizza rocks!",

I had the chicken parm for the 1st time yesterday - an excellent sandwich that maintained its flavor when I took it back to the office. (Probably a bit less sauce & a bit more cheese than I'd prefer, but that's just my taste.)  I've had a couple salads & a few pizzas & have liked them all. We don't come here nearly as often as Z Pizza (which is a few doors down), primarily because of the credit card issue -- currently (for lunch at least) they don't accept cards under $10, and lots of people rarely carry cash anymore. (The policy has gotten better over the years.) Pino's also charges extra for pretty much everything - refills, sauce, etc. I can understand the policies - this is not a chain & as far as I know it's still locally owned, so they probably need to watch their bottom line. Still, the policies affect people's willingness to go there, which is a shame, because the food is great.  (Note: parking is tight in front but there's more in back.)",

They do have an ATM inside you can get cash from, but off course you're getting dinged with a service charge (and I imagine they're getting a cut of that).    Of course, the coworker dragged a group of us there two weeks ago and the ATM wouldn't work for two of our cards, so we had to bum cash from others in our group.

However, bit of an issue when its time to leave and still no food.  Server blamed anyone and everything.  Too busy, cook forgot. large party, blah blah.   Honestly nobody cares about \"why\" at that point.  Someone say sorry and get the food right?   NOPE.    I asked for them to simply box it up and we could take it with.  Server said ok and they would take the item off the bill.  However, server instead brought it out in a bowl ready to eat.  Our server, ANYONE beyond cashier- all missing.  Maybe serious game Pictionary in the back?  It is still time to check out and - Server reappears and disingenuously states \"oh wait we did bring it to the table after all so we are not going to cover the item\".   I reminded him we asked them to box, and that rest of the food was ALREADY boxed.  Server says no, we brought it out and I added a meatball for your trouble.  Not really sure how a meatball compensates for that, but its nice he recognized it was a trouble I guess.   All that is laughable and whatever.  I had planned paying from the entree from beginning and the waiver had been a (now hollow) service gesture.  The 1 star is due to the Server himself.  At check out, he blamed Pino for the fact the item wasn't being covered.  I said thanks for letting me know- would share on Yelp.  Server became irate and began heckling our party (3 families) the entire time during check out with sarcastic comments combined with absurd statements about how this was saving his job.    BTW- FEDERAL PIZZA and SPINATOS have equally good entrees and better pizza with the added bonus of pleasant and professional staff",

Having not yet tried Pino's Pizza, I went in for lunch and ordered take out. I had a beer while I waited and since the counter service was pleasant I left a $2 tip.  Have you ever felt like you got ripped off?  I mean, $20 for a sandwich and a beer for lunch.....wow.  You'd think it was free range chicken imported from chicken heaven.  But the bill wasn't the worst part.  The sandwich ???  Noooooooooooooooooooo!!  If I wanted boiled chicken breast, with a tablespoon of red sauce with mozzarella cheese, I would have gone to the local retirement village.  This sandwich, though portioned right was AWFUL. The best thing about it was the roll. A chicken parm sandwich starts with italian bread crumb battered chicken, pan fried, with oh....let's say PARMESAN cheese, perhaps some melty provolone and a nice smothering of a FLAVORFUL red sauce.  This had NONE of those components. First time, shame on you, there will be no second time despite the prior decent reviews.",

I went in for dinner last night with a friend and feel the need to do SOMEthing to spread the word about this little gem of a place with FRESH, authentic and delicious food.    I'm Italian raised by FOB parents with a huge extended (Italian) family and lots of great Italian food lovingly made and offered at every turn.  Last night I felt like I was at one of those extended family/friends gatherings with food that could only be made by . . . a real Italian who puts his heart into it.    I could go on about the dishes last night:  Caprese salad, Brussel sprouts with Italian sausage,  Sfingiolone, THE HOMEMADE BREAD, and the famous pork chop with gorgonzola cream and a side of spaghetti marinara. . . but I hope you try it for yourself.  He's always making new specials from the old country that I've often never heard of and they're delicious and always always fresh.  A very modest, very casual place which looks like a pizza place at lunch, if you come for dinner, it can feel like you're at a much fancier place because of the good vibe and sense of privacy you can get at the farther away from the entrance tables.    If you peek in the kitchen, you'll know HOW FRICKIN CLEAN this place is kept (and I value that a lot)!!   This place has been around for 20 years or more and retains it's commitment to great, fresh, authentic (Pino is from Italy, can't help it) food from PIZZA to their delicious specials and pastas and HOMEMADE BREAD.  Pino's humble always underplaying how great his food is and one of the hardest working owners I've ever met.  He's (almost) Always there cooking, shops for his own fresh food before they open, you'll find him cleaning near close of day etc. etc.    Lucia, his wife and co-owner is sharp as a whip, fun funny and runs the place like clockwork.  WHY this place isn't packed every night is beyond me.  If I lived nearby I couldn't help but frequent it more often.",

Ordered a slice of cheese pizza for my son, and a cheese steak for myself. My son got his pizza in a few minutes as he got his order he asked the gentlemen who handed him his pizza for a side of ranch. The cashier yells across its .81 cents. Not a problem paying for extra but everyone in there turned and looked... As I was digging in my purse for the change a man I'm assuming to be the owner walked up and gave him the ranch I offered to pay it but he said no it's ok. I thought it was nice of him. I waited about 15 minutes for my sandwich when it came my son had already finished his pizza which was ok he enjoyed it and was full. He just got the cheese pizza as he is not a fan of toppings, the slices are pretty big, crispy... I didn't eat any so I can't elaborate on it. My cheese steak was pretty big, steak, mushrooms onions and spinach and tons and tons of cheese... I liked that my bread was so crispy and crunchy... I don't think it had much flavor other than cheese... I've had cheese steaks at other places and I can't say that this one was any better than I've had I actually could say I like another places better. At 12 dollars for it... I think I'll stick to my other spot for cheese steak. I'm not saying it was bad... Just not memorable.... The place is decorated nicely, pretty dim.. Bathroom was clean and pretty dim as well.

A few coworkers and I come here every week or so for our lunch hour and are so happy with every experience we have. The pizzas are huge and crafted with just the right amount of ingredients.

It's not cheap, but the quality of the food is supreme.  The antipasto was standout--several quality meats and cheeses and all the rest of the ingredients were unquestionably fresh.  My pizzas have always been perfection--a perfect medium-thin crust with tasty sauce and a compelling combo of cheeses I can't identify.  It's the kind of food you don't feel tempted to gorge on because each bite is savorable and satisfying.  Be sure to call before you show up--their hours are minimalist.  Be prepared to park in one of the neighboring lots as there's not much space.  Bring cash.",

The large pizza is huge! They make it fresh with fresh ingredients.  The service was outstanding and friendly.

Their Greek salad is humongous and amazing, with bursts of flavor from kalamata olives and feta. It's yummy with shredded pizza mozzarella on top too! The bread on the side is fresh and tasty. When I feel like a complete glutton, I go for the calzone, but be warned - it's about three meals' worth of food! The service is always good and everyone is super friendly. I'm not a huge fan of the pizza itself, but not because it's *bad\", but because NY style isn't my bag. There's plenty of pasta and sandwiches available though, in addition to calzones and salads - so any discerning palate should be pleased! Oh, yeah - beer and wine only, and the hours can be a little sporadic.",

Time was short and I couldn't get to their other location. So I stopped off here--had been before--pizza is OK, nothing great. What gets me is that each slice is 3 bucks--no lunch special. I know, 3 bucks, who cares, whatever. BUT, if you are going to charge that much for a slice, have the decency not to nickel and dime your customers to death for EVERYTHING else. While waiting, one of the seated customers came up to request some extra jalapenos for his sandwich. They charged him for them. When I asked for a cup of water, they told me it was 50 cents...after spending 7 bucks on 2 slices of mediocre pizza. Really? She asked if I wanted napkins when I left. I asked if they were free. She gave me a dirty look.  Not sure why, after what I had witnessed, it was a legitimate question. The food is 2 stars. The nickel and diming--unforgivable. Way too many other places with better slices to waste your time and money at this gouge hut.",

Not the incredible, gotta get it before it's gone, it's so worth the long lines (which there weren't).. mumbo jumbo I got. I will definitely go again (nicely dressed, and prepared for a restaurant), and perhaps I will have a better review. But as of now, it gets a 3..  I like the lack of servers though.

His New York Style Hamburger is nothing short of amazing. The parking situation sucks, as they only have about 6 spaces for a restaurant that gets busy every night of the week. They hours are lame as well, M-F 11-2 and 5-8.... Pino... you gotta stay up later! To sum it up, the food is incredible, and they have a nice little beer/wine list, but just be aware of the short hours, small parking lot, and no cash policy.",

The pizza is right up there with the few best places in Phx if you like Ny pizza( oil on top and all) I had a salad too. It came with fochaccia which I did not think was great,  but I  like the Garlic or Rosemary kind, so freepass there. TIRIMUSO- I have had it all over the world, since sadly I am addicted to the stuff, and this is one of the top two I have had. EXCELLENT! If I weren't in public I would have licked the plate clean.TEEHEEE- On my birthday I did lick the stryofoam container clean since I was in the privacy of my own home-teehee! The service is good here too.I went early so missed the crowd. ( Like 5pm on a weekday)  The man from France helped me on both occassions and he is very nice.

We'll be back for the desserts for sure!   The place is decorated with a mix of pop art and Italian rustic charm. It would seem more authentic with less pop art, and more Italian art.

After hearing about this place for several years from my brother we went to the family owned restaurant down the street perfectly nestled away in downtown. I haven't stopped going since, the space is larger than I expected and it is decorated tastefully and very clean!! The owner was greeting customers with the staff in a laid back manner which made me instantly comfortable. After sitting down we were quickly waited on by an exceptional waitress and I ordered a wonderful glass of a white moscato as it was Monday and I earned it. We ordered a classic cheese pizza and the BEST chicken parmigiana sandwich EVER. I've had a lot of parm in my life and this was amazing. The chicken was not breaded and not too thick or hard to bite. I could take a bite and have just the right proportion of cheese, chicken, amazing sauce and the lightest yet crisp bread which made for the best sandwich ever. It was so good but I still tried the pizza and I'm ruined... No other place will ever be like Pinos! I've been back weekly since and look forward to going again soon. I really have to try some of the specials though including some pastas, I did see a few that looked amazing but I can't cheat on my parm.. Cheers to the restaurant we all want to find - just leave room for me when you're too packed to seat anyone else because word gets around how amazing the food and ambience really is.",

I'm not a fan of ranch dressing but the ladies are and we ordered it on the side for dipping (comes in the sandwich).   We were a group of 7 who staggered in slightly apart, all placed separate orders and came together at one table. Food was delicious and this was a great find for satisfying food and drink in a long day of meetings.",

To me Federal Pizza has some of the best pizza in the Valley.  This would come in second for me.  1 slice is huge!  Not like the $5 slices you pick up in DC huge but bigger than a normal slice of pizza.  The waitress asked if I were ordering more than one slice.  She said, \"if you are then you should just order a 10 inch pizza because of the price\".  One slice was almost 6 bucks, a 10 inch was around 10 bucks and change I believe.  Next time I'll just go with the 10 inch.    I ordered the pepperoni and sausage slice.  Homemade sausage might I add.  Man ... it was soooooooo good and pippin hot.  Note to self and others:  Let it set for longer than 2 minutes before you try and take a bite.  Trust me!",

Okay... so we're basically at $30 after tax and tip we're over... but nope. Not budging... we must order more before they'll deliver. \"Do you want a cannoli?\" she asks. No. We do not want a cannoli, so we order a drink. We've achieved their iron clad minimum. She tells us it will be 30 minutes, okay sounds good. It's 11:10 when she tells us that.... smash cut to 12:55 and we're still waiting for our $28.50 pizza. (By the way... a Margherita pizza is cheese and basil. Imagine if we had actual toppings) The pizza finally arrives and it's congealed and cold and the drink doesn't have a single ice cube left. I call and tell her that it took 3 times longer than she said and the pizza is now cold. She says, oh sorry. Okaaay... well we're not happy and would like some compensation at this point. \"I'll talk to my manager\" *wait on hold for awhile*  She picks back up \"Pino's, how can I help you?\". I remind her what's going on and she says \"oh, I thought I accidentally hung up on you\". *back on hold.......* She picks up and says that she talked to the manager and he said because we took the food they won't do anything and that we should've picked it up if we wanted hot pizza. So, basically it's our fault. By the way, I've eaten here before and the pizza is really good... but apparently it has a window because today's experience is a deal breaker. Sucks to pay so much for a cold congealed pizza that you waited almost two hours for. And then to receive such POOR CUSTOMER SERVICE on top of it??! Bye.",

The pizza has a thinner crust with very gooey cheese, which is what I like.  I ordered half cheese and half with their meat combo.   Tastes like quality ingredients on both sides.  I also got the cannoli, which was serviceable, but not the best I've had.  I'll skip it next time.  Nice atmosphere, remember that there's parking in back because the front lot can fill up during lunch.  One caution:  I ordered a 10\" half cheese, half meat.  The cheese is $10, the meat is $15, and they charged me the whole $15.  Not the end of the world, but $16 and change (after tax) for a 10\" pizza that's half cheese is a bit steep for me.  Something to keep in mind if you're planning on doing half cheese.",

    "text": "I have been coming to this place for years and can only rave about how delicious the food is.   Its not uncommon to find the owner sitting at your table for a bit, regaling you with stories of Italy, or boasting about how many of the meats he uses are shipped fresh from Italy. Or how the mozzarella and pasta are made daily by hand.  And oh man, you can tell. The place may not look like much from the outside, but the cozy and comfortable inside makes you almost feel transported to Italy itself. When you're seated, you're enticed with the daily specials; each one sounding more delicious than the last. The pork chop in gorgonzola sauce is by far the best, and its so large you'll have plenty for later!   Their pizza is thin and greasy, with fresh mozzarella and delicious house made sauce full of tomatoes thats clearly been simmered with some type of meat. I'm usually not a fan of any marinara sauce, but this one I could drink. I would buy it by the jar if they sold it lol.   My usual go to is their calzones though, which are gigantic and topped with more delicious cheese, pepperonies (I always get their pepperoni calzone) and a tiny amount of spinach. They're not overtly stuffed which I think is a shame but they're filled with large and small pepperonies and plenty of cheese. They give you the same sauce thats on their pizza, which as I've stated is basically addictive so none goes to waste...though its definitely gone to MY waist...  My one complaint is that when I found this place everything was very moderately priced, even their house specials were less than 15$ a plate. Now they're over 30$ and even the calzones which were less than 10$ are now closer to 13$. I used to order take out so often that they recognized our names and memorized our order but since the price increase we rarely order from here anymore. I would still definitely suggest this place to anyone looking for authentic and delicious Italian food in an intimate yet casual environment.  Plus the calzones are by far the best in town (since 4 brothers closed years ago) and especially the best downtown.",

They should bring the pizzas out to you, but they don't.  It's a little less expensive than Z Pizza just down the street, and it's better as well. I'm actually craving it again. Phoenix has some of the best pizza in the country - this place isn't the best in town, but it's another prime example of great Phoenix pizza joints.",

    "text": "Sorry, guys.  Pizza was solid in terms of dough/crust quality. Other than that, super super greasy (actually needed to do the paper towel dab move to get the grease pools off), lousy and sparse sauce, and just plain overpriced. $20 for a takeout large pizza in central Phoenix (cheese with a smattering of greasy pepperoni) is just way too much. Management clearly is in the nickel and diming business. I dined in once and the bread basket was $5 and olive oil (2 ounces as it was advertised) was $3. Wow, guys, charging for the olive oil? Must be good. Also, hairs in my pizza. Also, any place that looks as though they are purposefully hiding menu prices (no prices on menu thru Yelp, no website with menu and prices) in my experience is usually over priced. Don't have a better place to point you guys to other than Pomo which is on the higher end of the scale in price and quality. Basic takeout pizza options in Phoenix still suck! Back to fired pie. At least the product is worth the price there.",

    "text": "Stopped here on a Saturday early afternoon, because someone had recommended it to me. We split a meatball parm hero, and a slice of cheese pizza. Everything was fairly good. In fairness, I bet the pizza is better freshly made than reheated, so I do plan to go to try. I am really interested in trying some pasta dishes and definitely the lasagna.  The place was completely dead when we were there, but it sounds like this place does most of its business with the office lunch crowd.  Plus we were there at a late lunch hour for a Saturday. So no big shock. We talked to Pino for a bit.  He is a very nice man. He is from south of Naples, and he has that European spirit to him. He speaks passionately about his ingredients, about Italy and so on.  If I had just gotten this same food delivered, I am not sure if I would make a point to be back soon. But knowing more about the ingredients he uses, and his variety of dishes, I am looking forward to going back and trying other things including a freshly made pizza.",

    "text": "One of my favorite lunch spots in the downtown/uptown part of Phoenix. It's the classic family-run Italian restaurant with some of the best pizza around.  Service is always friendly and prompt, which is no small feat at lunchtime, considering the place is typically packed. I think I've probably tried half of the menu, plus a number of the daily specials, and everything is consistently good. The New York style pizza (pick up, fold in half, go nuts) comes in large slices with generous amounts of toppings.   As for pasta, I can honestly say that I don't believe I've ever had an overcooked dish here, which is not something I can say about most Italian food restaurants. The ravioli is very good, as is the tortellini (when it's on special). I'm also partial to their salads, which are quite large. Both the chicken caesar and the tuna salad contain ample amounts of meat, which I prefer.  And if you want a great base for a sandwich, you can't get much better than their focaccia bread, which is soft and delicious.  The one thing that does rankle me about Pino's, however, is that they now have a $10 minimum purchase for credit card payment. I understand their reasonings for the move (credit card fees can rack up in a hurry for small businesses and take larger than expected bites out of profit margins), but as someone who rarely carries cash and doesn't always order a lot of food, it is a bit of a pain.  There also isn't much parking in front, but savvy patrons know to check the lot behind the restaurant and come in the back door.",

Perfectly cooked, the 10'' was a large portion size perfect for sharing. The Parmesan topping was fresh as were the greens making this refreshing and hearty at the same time!  Fabulous pizza!

But the pizza is really good, really satisfying. And as far as I know, this is the best place to get a calzone in town. I've had the one at Cibo. Pino's is much better, among the best I've ever had. They put a little bit of sauce inside the pocket and there's a side of sauce for dipping. Everything about the calzone is balanced and absolutely satisfying.   Salads are also very good here. I've never eaten in, I just get takeout. I see another reviewer here shares my one biggest wish: that we could get Pino's on Sundays. Please, Pino's. That's the best day to stay in and have a calzone in front of the TV. Please open on Sundays. Take Mondays off instead. Please!",

Without a doubt when my teeth sank into the awesome slice of Sicilian style pizza I knew I was coming back, and I was bringing more people with me.  I am at a loss for words when it comes to that 4 sided piece of heaven.   The mix of chewy and hot, crunchy and smooth all mixed together in such a wonderful manner becomes the canvas of the artisan.  There are hundreds of ways to do pizza, and only a few ways to do it right.  These guys hit the target.  The crust was strong, the cheese was delightful, and the sauce supported its cast of sausage, pepperoni and spices like an oscar winner.   For lunch I don't think this place has anyone in their league.  Quick service, solid menu, salads that make even this meat lover think twice about what to order; this place made us smile as our eyes wondered about the room seeing what others ordered taking mental notes for future visits.",

Pizza about the same- nice texture but not awesome tastes. Pepperoni on pizza same little slices they use on Red Baron frozen pizzas. We might be back to try some other dishes.  Pro: Nice staff. Good portions Clean  Cons: Prices! Flavorless food",

I was pleasantly surprised by the quality of food they serve.   The pepperoni pizza was great, Caesar salad was delicious and the mixed green with house balsamic was amazing.  The pan roasted salmonbwas fantastic.   The pasta with marinara was very authentic and the portions were huge.  We were just passing by Phoenix and were so lucky to meet up with  some friends here. The tiramisu was top notch.  Lots of cream yet light and fluffy. I would come back in a heartbeat.",

    "text": "I co-worker challenged me to a pizza taste test.  Their choice for favorite is Pino's, so we went there today.  I ordered two slices of cheese pizza, since that is the fair way to sample! The pizza is not bad, but not as good as I like.  You order at the counter, and when your number is called you go pick up your food, so there is no table service.  You lose me when you do not do free drink refills...this is AZ.  They charge .81 for a diet coke refill! The parking lot was difficult to navigate, and we almost got hit by someone when we were leaving. Several customers were coming up to the counter looking for missing food.  It looked like one table was given free cannolli when their order took especially long.  Ours came out quickly enough, and was accurate.",

There was probably a 15-minute wait but it was worth it since their dishes are fresh, hot, and made-to-order and I promise you that your tongue will notice the freshness. My friends, who are regular customers, ordered the Carnivori and a calzone. They devoured it. They visit this place about every week.  The decorations are well done. Very similar to restaurants I have been to in Europe. I cannot wait to return and try their other dishes!  Also, it is awesome to find a restaurant that appreciates military customers.",

    "text": "Gosh. I read some of the reviews here and, they made me so sad! I love this place! The food is delicious, the service has always been great and the prices are so reasonable. I am happy to say that I have not experienced any of the negative things posted in some of these past reviews and we have been there many times.   Walk in - the first thing we see is a young attractive girl with bright red lipstick behind a counter. She has always greeted us kindly.  Behind her is a view into their spotless kitchen. Most of the time, I see Pino in the kitchen and he always happily greets us as we walk through the door.  No complaints there.  Service has always been terrific! Our servers have always been friendly and efficient. Many times, we've sat down and ordered and Pino would send out a little treat to keep us content while we waited for our food - which never takes long to begin with!  The food though...oh, the food! The bread is wonderful. Crusty on the outside, chewy and moist on the inside. I want to eat that bread until I go into a coma.  The pizza crust is the same - crusty on the outside, nice and chewy on the inside. Of course the toppings are delicious too but for me, it is all about the texture. At first bite, you get that nice crunch of crust on the bottom and as you pull away from that slice, the cheese wants to stretch and follow your mouth but happily, the cheese does not all slide off (I hate when that happens!). So yummy! Their calzones are amazing too. Again, nice and crusty outside and steamy deliciousness inside. They have the best meatball sandwich I've ever tasted but be warned! It is huge! Try their specials too - we have yet to be disappointed!  My favourites are Pino's Caesar salad and his simple spaghetti with marinara. I'll start with the Caesar; bright crunchy romaine lettuce topped with a substantial amount of shredded parmesan, croutons and delicious home made Caesar dressing. The dressing is thick, flavourful and just perfect. When I add chicken, it bumps the salad up a few notches too. The chicken isn't that processed stuff - it is freshly cooked, shredded chicken. One salad is a heck of a meal!  The spaghetti marinara is my absolute favourite and it is what I usually ask for. The dish always comes out piping hot and the sauce, which seems simple, offers such complex and subtle flavours of fresh tomato, basil, and garlic. Perfectly seasoned every time - it makes me want to close my eyes with every blissful bite. The pasta has the perfect bite to it too - never mushy. Nice and chewy. It is served with some of that amazing bread too!  I am not a very big fan of tiramisu. Call me crazy but I generally won't order it for dessert anywhere. But at Pino's, I do! It is amazing! I love that it is not overly sweet and that it is so light and creamy, I want to eat the entire huge slice they serve. I love cannoli too and theirs are delicious. Sometimes at other restaurants, the cannoli can go a little stale or soft but at Pino's, the cannoli are always super crunchy and the filling is just wonderful. Normally, I'd always reach for cannoli but here, I just can't resist the tiramisu.  So yummy!  Portions are huge. Last night my husband and I went there for dinner. He ordered wine, I ordered iced tea. He had the Caesar salad with chicken, I had the Spaghetti marinara. We split the tiramisu. Our total bill was under $40 and we went home with left overs!  Pino's is a small, family run business and I like that. I like that we see the same people working there day after day and I like that the food tastes like someone's Grandmother cooked it in her home. I like that the food is not too expensive and that it is not all dressed up and customized to such a degree that it no longer tastes like the original recipe. Now, I'm going to go and finish up last night's dinner. Nothing like leftover spaghetti marinara for breakfast! Bon Appetit!",
