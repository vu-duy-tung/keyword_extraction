It's a nice place to meet since they offer a private room for meetings and you can obviously provide food for attendees straight from the Wild Flower Bread Company via banquet style or ordered individually.  Service is always attentive and good and lattes and cappuccinos are made pretty well.  As for the food, quite average.  Scrambled egg dishes could probably be less dry and as for breakfast sandwiches, they're pretty basic (although the breads they make and use for sandwiches are quite good).  This place reminds me of The Corner Bakery that we have here in S. Cal. but perhaps not as good on food quality and offerings.  Still, it's a nice space with a lot of seating and has a bright, chipper vibe that helps kick start your morning.",

I'm not sure if it was the sweet potato itself or the fig sauce that tasted so sweet (actually a little to sweet for my preference) but the sandwich had a great flavor & was a reasonably hEalthy option.  I loved that this sandwich was very fresh tasting and made with good quality ingredients.  It was also large enough that I didn't need to order anything else so I saved my chocolate chip scone for later.  I Will be going back!",

My understanding is that the owner went to France to find a great chef to create the bread...you need great bread for a great sandwich.  The premise seems to have worked, as the restaurant has now exploded into a chain within AZ.  I personally recommend the Bear Claws and Chocolate Croissants amongst the baked goods.  I usually have the Ham and Egg sandwich on whole grain, instead of the Ciabatta, but both breads are delicious.  I also recommend the banana pancakes.  My only reason for going 4-stars is this particular visit I pointed out the pancakes didn't have much banana (if at all) in the batter.  The staff courteously offered to remake, but they were good nonetheless.   The atmosphere is brighter than other restaurants in this space, e.g., Panera and Paradise Bakery.  They have newspapers for one to browse through, bread samples upon entrance, and great coffee.  Lastly, there are multiple booths, and all have outlets located beneath, which caters to those needing a break from the home office, or the worker on the go.  Cheers!",

My husband is not a sandwich eater....until this one came along.  We are having friends over for lunch tomorrow and guess what?  All requested that we order the same Cranberry Turkey Stuffing sandwich.  And the bacon on it is a plus.  I also ordered some of the pumpkin muffins for dessert.  Delicious.

    "text": "This may be the longest Yelp review in the history of written form, so I apologize. It's worth reading. Please share.  After my last experience, Louis, the founder/owner of WIldflower contacted me about my review. He didn't pull an Amy's Baking on me. He was very kind, caring, and asked me very specific questions about what happened last time. We even spoke on the phone and had a lengthy conversation about it.  It was very nice to get to know him, and understand his passion for good food, and great service. We also talked about some of Wildflower's charitable work with some non-profit groups like Komen.    He was very concerned about my bad experience, and wanted to make things right. Not just by giving me my money back, but by fixing what was wrong.   By the end of our conversation, I offered to come back to the restaurant on my own dime, with no expectations for my money back. I told him that I did appreciate the kind gesture.   A week later, in the mail, I received a refund, a gift card for one meal, AND a receipt for a very generous donation to the Komen foundation. Earlier, I had told him about a friend who was a breast cancer survivor. I was moved by this donation.  Today, I went back to Wildflower, and used my gift card. So in full disclosure, I write this review.  I ordered the a sandwich with roasted sweet potato, fresh mozzarella, fig confit, tomato, arugula, marinated fennel and Balsamic Vinaigrette on Herb Focaccia. It was like heaven on a plate.   The mozza and fig confit was the pairing that is a match made in heaven. Think Stockton and Malone. Jordan and Pippen. Jay Z and Beyonce. Donny and Marie. Yeah. That freaking amazing.  The Focaccia was pillowy soft and a delight. I want more.  On the side, I had the passion mango slaw. It was simply....great.   This was one of the rare occasions that I enjoyed a sandwich without ordering meat. I was shocked, but I was feeling adventurous.  I am really sad about leaving Scottsdale, because this is one place I honestly could see myself visiting weekly.   Last time, I complained about the long wait. Perhaps it's due to the high quality. I'm not sure what happened last time. Maybe it was an off-morning. Read all the other reviews. They are fairly consistent.  I am very happy with my return to Wildflower. I am very glad I gave it another shot.  Louis, you are a great businessman, and your breadheads are fantastic people.  When I come back to visit Scottsdale, I will pay you a visit.",

I do not appreciate his mannerisms, or the rude, snide, and passive-aggressive comments I hear him say.

I had the beef sandwich and it was very very tender and perfectly seasoned.  The bread was very soft and not a disappointment for a bakery like Paradise was.  They had really good iced tea, though I didn't catch the name of the brand.  I prefer the counter service now over having a server, though they lack an organized line or signs as to how their multiple counters work.  Maybe a rope system or something to help when it's busy may guide people where to go?  The only other thing that didn't overwhelm me was the cinnamon roll that I got to go.  It was huge, but wasn't very soft.  Maybe it was because I got it to go and is better fresh in the store.  All in all, the outlets for the computers saved our meeting and the sandwich was delicious.  We will definitely be back for another lunch meeting.",

They are so much, and I can't stress this enough, so much better than Paradise Bakery. They even have delicious baked goods. One of my favorite things to do is go on a bike ride with my girlfriend and stop there for lunch or a late breakfast. They also have great coffee so go to them instead of the Starbucks around the corner. My favorite sandwich is the Chicken Pesto which I usually customize to suit my particular needs. I'm kind of a food snob.",

Neither place is perfect but when I add together the positives and negatives of each; they come out even.  In all fairness though, I've only been to Wildflower 2-3 times, but I've been to Paradise more times than I care to count.  Wildflower has a much bigger selection of salads and sandwiches than Paradise with is nice because Paradise always has the same stuff and it really never ever changes.  Wildflower's menu seems to be very fresh.  Wildflower has a good selection of salads, sandwiches and cookies along with a friendly and clean atmosphere.  The other day I had one of their 1/2 sandwich and 1/2 salad specials.  I got the roast beef and Gorgonzola with a side Ceasar.  The sandwich was ok but pretty impossible to eat without making a complete mess.  The salad was also very good but had too much dressing on it.  My wife got the chopped salad which was excellent and very unique.  I think they stole it from Cowboy Caio.  I would like to go back soon and try some more sandwiches and salads and maybe some of their breakfast stuffs.",

Not overwhelmingly cheesy or lemony, simple yet tasty. The blueberry compote is the perfect sweetness to match the light acidity of the pancakes. Delicious.  Also, the walnut banana pancakes are quite good, as is the banana bread.   The frittata, however, was not very good. A little overcooked and extremely earthy.  The staff was kind enough to refund the frittata, however.  In addition, depending on how busy they are, the wait time for the food can be a while. We waited over 20 minutes for our breakfast, and then it came out separate. Since this isn't really a sit down place, that seemed like a long time to wait.",

Did you know they use cage-free, antibiotic-free, hormone-free chicken in their chicken dishes?  Always very fresh, always consistent, delicious food--and that's as close to perfect as a restaurant can get!  I finally tried something a little different today: 1/2 roast beef and gorgonzola sandwich and 1/2 Caesar salad...FABULOUS! Every bite was pure deliciousness!  Although I'm trying to cut the sweets, I'm going to indulge in a cupcake or a piece of cake next visit....they look wonderful, as well!  This place ROCKS!",

I was expecting a bagel shop kind of thing but they have an entire breakfast and lunch menu along with all kinds of bread, bagels, muffins, cake, and all kinds of other goodies. There were 7 of us and everyone left very satisfied. I only had a muffin and a few bites of the potatoes, but there were pancakes, eggs, bacon, and sandwiches around the table and everything looked great. And huge! Big portions here, I don't think anyone actually finished their entire breakfast.   You have to try the potatoes! They're kind of diced and seasoned and then pan fried and man are they good!   This is Scottsdale dah-ling, so of course it was super nice and clean. If you don't drive a Benz, BMW or Audi they might impound you, so watch out ; )",

On approach I thought I was going to an East Coast Panera Bread, or a friendly neighborhood albeit overpriced Paradise Bakery, but then I open the doors to a cavernous living room with a baking problem.

She came in with a very large dog that had no help vest on. When the manager (female) asked her for the permit for the dog the woman became absolutely irate and started berating her. She then proceeded to pour herself some coffee and realized the dispensers weren't full. A nice young lady replied that she was brewing coffee right now and that she could pour her some. The woman with the dog then proceeded to yell for her money back, saying this is ridiculous and that her manager should learn when to stop talking.   Round two occurs between the female manager and the irate woman about the dog not having a vest on and the woman demands to talk to the owner/superior who could fire the woman. A male manager then steps out to talk to her and she is by no means any more calm. I would hate to see this manager lose her job for some Scottsdale house wife who couldn't be bothered to leave her dog out side a place where food is sold, especially when state law requires a vest on all help dogs. I've been here many times, the service has always been fantastic. I'm currently writing this review while eating my Turkey Waldorf salad (which is delicious by the way), hoping to do some good for a working woman who was treated so appallingly.",

Parking:  This location is in a crowded strip mall area, next to Cycle Bar and other businesses, like a cupcake place, a shoe store, etc.  The parking can get busy, but there's always a spot, though not right by the actual restaurant.   Service: Pretty good and friendly. I have also reserved the large room for meetings.   The individuals who helped me reserve were friendly and helpful.     Food:  Simple and tasty - sandwiches, salads, good desserts such as chocolate brownies, cookies, lemon bars.  The salads are interesting with tasty dressing.  I have tried some of the sandwiches - unique options.  The bagels and pretzels are doughy, fresh and delicious.    Atmosphere:  Simple, there is seating indoors and out. When it is cooler, I noted a lot of people out on the patio area.   Cost: Cheap to moderate - $9 to $15 or so for meals.  I purchased a plastic cup specific to Wildflower in which one can get refills for the cost of a small drink. However, sometimes I am charged more.   Large room:   For business meetings, the restaurant offers a large room that people can reserve. It costs during certain hours, but it is free later with a minimum food purchase.  The organization in which I am in reserved the room. All went well, though I had to request the loud music to be turned down three times. Also, this other group was still in there when had the room, and they seemed annoyed we were there, but we were there at the time in which we had reserved.",

The food is delicious, and the hospitality and sense of community is the creamy and delicious butter on today's fresh baked red, white, and blue (berries and cession) bread. Frank, an associate at this  Seville Scottsdale Wildflower location whom I met today, is an excellent example of the genuine, authentic care and compassion for guests. Here's the deal: I just spent the last three hours in a spa getting a massage and a facial. I walked in the door, face glowing like an angel or an alien, and saw the spicy lemon penne pasta: a summer special that looks mouth watering- and the picture of it drew me in. My eyes must have beamed-I wanted to try the Spicy Lemmon Penne Pasta, but unfortunately I was an hour too early for it to be available. Frank was very compassionate, and assured me that he really wished I could try it today and was sorry that it wasn't available yet. I appreciated the compassion. I decided to try the Lemon Chicken vegetable soup instead (I guess i was craving tart/lemon today!? ). Anyway, Frank brought it over and I enjoyed it. He came over and checked on me and I shared with him that I thought it was delicious. I also said that it could have used more lemon. Frank then exclaimed oh yes, it is even better with lemons. And he offered to bring me a bowl with lemon slices. I took him up on it, and was so taken aback to his kindness and hospitality. When he brought it out, it was even more delicious than the first bowl. I'm thankful to Frank and to wildflower for their focus on fresh and delicious food and amazing hospitality and experience.",

We split the Feta and Roasted Vegetable Frittata and the Lemon Ricotta Pancakes and WOW!  For basically a sandwich/cafe type restaurant that normally pulls off a good sandwich, soup or pastry, we couldn't believe it! The food was just as good if not better than the larger breakfast chains in the area.  The Manager, Frank, is also outstanding! He stopped by our table to greet us, something that is rarely seen anywhere.  We will definitely be back!!",

It was open so in we went.. we ordered the wildflower Ruben sandwich & were not disappointed! I love ordering Ruben's from places around the valley & they made an exceptional version of it here. There was a good amount of meat & it was very tasty, just the right amount of sauce, and the flavor of the kraut balanced the sandwich out perfectly in between a lightly buttered marble rye. There was a tasty side of potato salad that tasted delicious, creamy & love the flavor of the red potato skins.  Aside from the great food, there was Frank...  Frank deserves a post all of his own. As we were waiting for our food Frank took the time to stop by and ask us how we were doing. He made us feel extremely welcome and took his time to not only welcome us during our first visit but provide us with more information about the company. I personally enjoy hearing about what companies are doing to reach out to the local communities & to understand their values. Frank I can see is the cornerstone to WBC & all the other employees were very helpful and kind.   We will be back to see you soon! :)",

My girlfriend got a half BLT and cup of soup-- the half sandwich was the tiniest thing I have ever seen. My 110 pound gf literally finished it in 3 bites.

I was really impressed with the freshness and flavor of my sandwich, and I just couldn't say no to a dessert since they had such a good variety of tea in the place.

The bread was delicious and easy to enjoy, knowing it was gluten-free.   Frank, the manager, was so personable and accommodating to any of our needs.

Also my friend asked for a side of chips with their sandwich (which comes free with it) and we somehow got a side of chips plus the chips on the plate with the sandwich. We checked the receipt and we were charged twice for chips...even though they come free with a sandwich order!?! Awful",

I had to hunt high and low for it and let me tell you, I think there was an equivalent of one chicken nugget!  When I mentioned this to the manager, he said \"oh, we weigh everything\".  Huh.  They should check their scales.  Companion had a sandwich and the bread was stale.  Oh wait, isn't this a BREAD company?  Not to mention the passion fruit tea tasted like, well, nothing.  No passion about it.  Shame on us for trying a chain restaurant.  I'll stick to the independents that actually serve food.  UPDATE:  I am changing my review due to the immediate response of the owner and management.  They responded within an hour and took my review with genuine concern.  They assured me that what I experienced was not normal and they have spoken to their staff.  Based on this, and friends assurances that this is a great place, I will try it again and hope it was a one-time thing.

Compared to similar restaurants, Wildflower is a friendlier, homier place for me. I think the staff makes the effort to get to know the regulars and to be friendly with all the customers. It is, and will remain, my \"go-to\" place for any meal because of those great qualities: great food, friendliness, cleanliness, and fun. Oh, and Wi-Fi too!",

The location was convenient, parking was plentiful, service was friendly (I got my muffin to go). My muffin wasn't bad, but I was a bit disappointed that I could not get a half/caf iced coffee there, only fully caffeinated.  I tried a sample of their jalapeno cheese bread on my way out and it was delicious.   The menu looks good, and indicates that their Caesar Salad has \"traditional\" Caesar dressing, so I'll go back again to try it",

Food is even more fresh, flavorful, and tempting.  Chipotle Spinach salad was great springtime salad. Sweet strawberries and chipotle poppyseed dressing covered up the sourness from spinach. Bacon, gorgonzola, dried corn, and toasted walnuts added the crunch and saltiness the salad needs. Also, large portion of chicken breast.  (Hint, similar to panera's strawberry poppy seed salad)  Cinnamon Brioche French Toast was well made. The hot syrups was a huge plus. The two-piece in kid's portion left us wanted more.  Overall a strong 3 star!!",

I recommend any sandwich or salad and make aure you get the pesto vinagrette salad dressing on the side for all you can dip. The dressing goes with absolutely anything. I would even put it on the potato salad its that good.   On the bakery side they have Pretzels that are to die for. Perfectly salted and flavorful. Dunk them in the pesto dressing as well or mustard! This is now my go-to lunch spot and i never feel gross no matter how often I eat here!   If you haven't tried this place you are truly missing out on a restaurant you'll want to live at! Did i mention they are open late? You can even get your cravings satified for dinner. One of the few lunch places that stays open for dinner.",

That being said every time I come to Wildflower (which isn't that often) I realize I like it more that I thought.   I can't remember the the last time I had any \"real\" food here (sandwiches, salads, soups...). I think I had a breakfast sandwich awhile back that I remember being good. They do have really good pastries here! The chocolate chip scone that's SO GOOD! I've gotten it the last few times I came here. Also, for what's it worth, my nephew really likes the turkey sandwich on the kids menu (which is a pretty simple thing, I know). He's a picky eater, so this is one of the few places I don't mind taking him to.   One complaint I have...no iced coffee refills. It's plain old brewed iced coffee just like Panera/Paradise Bakery and they do refills.   Overall this is a good, higher quality chain restaurant for lunch.",

They ended up donating all of our food (including dessert), plates, napkins, utensils, etc. Everyone raved about the food and we were able to raise more money for a good cause because of it.   Frank and the other employees we worked with were so wonderful and so supportive, and since then we have even used the private conference room at the Seville location for our board meetings.

I ate the better part of one sausage before I had to stop.  But the star of the breakfast was the potatoes - chunky with rosemary and sea salt.  So simple, yet SO delicious.  I will get the breakfast with bacon next time, as they serve applewood smoked.  The toast was their 9-grain, and it was so good, I bought a loaf.  And they used real butter on the bread!  This is the location we will come back to!",

We like the atmosphere and find it friendly and the staff kept the tables clean.    The food is tasty and of good quantity however the newly featured sandwich that was promoted was sold out so minus one star.    My wife tried a paste dish and found it tasty while I tired a grilled turkey pastrami.  My sandwich tasted very good but I struggled with the contents falling out including the honey mustard which left a stick mess.  Next time we are in this area we will return.",

The bread is always fresh and delicious, great selection.  The menu choices are varied.  My favorite is the Chopped Salad.  Each ingredient is presented in rows with the yummy dressing on the side.  A perfectly balanced salad that is not your usual lettuce and toppings.  This place is always crowded for lunch, even the outdoor patio is filled to capacity. I have recommended Wildflower to many people, none have been disappointed.",

    "text": "Hey there. New guy in town on vacation looking for some fast food that was tasty, found this place. Had good reviews, and i was looking forward to eating there. I feel like I was slightly let down.  When I showed up it looked like a good lunch counter. Many options on the menu, polite and kind knowable staff. The \"spicy meatball sun\" jumped out at me. This and a lemonade cost almost 12 dollars. When I got the sandwich it was tasty, but the meatballs were Luke warm and the cheese was just starting to melt. It also only had 3 meatballs in there. I mean come on a 9 dollar sandwich with three meatballs, like come on, there needs to be more substance. The bread however did hit the mark. It kept crunchy and was chewy without getting overly soggy. The sandwich was also advertised as spicy, yeah right. It kept my mouth bored. There were visible peppers on there but they were blandly pickled into oblivion. Like I know that you have to produce many of these a day, but the Subway meatballs are spicier. At the end of the day if you want to grab food there take into account what there is around. Everything here closes early or is sit down. Recommend for people who are just trying to get food fast and not go to mc Donald's. Could of done better. Personally, might go back if I need to, but I will likely avoid it.",

    "text": "I finally had the chance to eat at the new Wildflower location today and all I can say is bravo Wildflower. Another job well done.   First, the location. This area needed a Wildflower badly and I plan on adding this to my weekend rotation immediately. Wildflower went above and beyond for the customer's needs at this location. Did you know that each booth has multiple power outlets so that you can plug your computer in from pretty much anywhere in the restaurant? For anyone who works on the go, they know how much of a godsend this is. If a shop doesn't have enough power outlets, they can lose customers quickly because a computer battery only lasts so long! The restaurant is incredibly spacious and even though there was a line out the door, I found a seat right away because it's big enough to accommodate the large crowds.   So speaking of large crowds, apparently Scottsdale got the Wildflower memo because it was swarming with lunch goers! But the Wildflower staff did a fabulous job with getting each customer in and out in an efficient manner. They didn't rush anyone but they knew how to handle the crowd. Once I got through the line, I was impressed with the friendly and fast service.   Like other Wildflower locations, the food is fabulous as usual. The bread is fresh and soft. And the salads and sandwiches are still tasty. Today, I noticed adorable mini cakes in the case. They would make for a perfect miniature birthday cake for a friend or coworker! I also noticed the arrival of pumpkin chocolate chip muffins. Let pumpkin season begin my friends!",

My favorite salad is the chopped salad, rivals all others that I've had.  The only thing that would make it better is if the salads had the option to have sliced avocado on it (you can add avocado, but it's the avocado that's already mashed up and used as a sandwich spread.)   They have great breakfast too!    The Scottsdale location is great - big, lots of booths, and a large outdoor seating area.  It is much more relaxed than some of the other locations and they have great service.  Every time I have been there, there is a good amount of seating available.",

I was greeted by a not so nice lady who didn't really know if she even wanted to take my order and never said anything to me until I just started ordering. I finally ordered after it seemed that her mind was somewhere else. Although at the end of the day she got the job done. The place in general is super clean and set up very organized and cute. I personally don't like eating alone but I didn't mind eating by myself here for some reason. There was enough space for me to sit by myself away from crows too :-). Also my phone was at like 5% and i had no service but lucky day! They have outlets below every booth and free wifi!! Wooo hoo!! Lastly, the manager (or what looked like) is what made me bump it back up to 5 starts because he came up to me as i had not started eating yet and said \"Hey you haven't touched your food! Do you want me to help you eat it too?!\" very jokingly and it made my day! Very nice staff as you can read and The food you say? ALWAYS a home run I got the triple club and wow it's something else!",

I usually visit for dinner after a workout at Orangetheory (which is conveniently located in the same plaza). I usually get a BLT plus or chopped salad. In the winter months their soup is a great choice as well. They have a rotating soup menu so the flavors never get boring. You can also choose half soup, salad or sandwich combo if you can't decide what you want. They have a large bakery selection as well, from pastries and fresh bread. I have not had one of their pastries, but am always tempted. They also have a large selection of breakfast foods and beverages. The service is usually excellent, quick, and friendly.",

It's a light sandwich and really a great mix of tuna, apples, nuts and maybe a few other ingredients. Instead of potato salad I would suggest getting the potato/sweet potato chip mix.  Each time I have digressed from the Tuna, I've been dissatisfied. I don't know what it is, but I don't find Wildflower to be an above average meal. I wish there was an LGO in Scottsdale!",

And although this is a walk-up and order at the counter place, try bring out your food, brought my mom a water, and grabbed hot sauce of me, even after I had gotten up to walk in to get it myself. Someone stopped me, asked what I needed and insisted she get it. The manager checked on us to make we enjoyed our meal at the end. Everyone was great. Perfect way to start Mother's Day.

I've had little \"enjoy\" letters in my to-go bag and once forgot a muffin at the register and the cashier ran out to my car. I appreciate all their service with a smile",

Not only do the employees give attitude when you are double checking ingredients to make sure an item you are allergic to isn't included. But when you are finally able to sit down at a table you spend your meal being bumped again and again by the young work staff cutting through the tables instead of walking around to the outside. The whole time we were here there wasn't even a presence of a manager on duty to even give them the heads up. Also I know we all love our social media and communications but if you are on the clock- leave your phone in the back and be available for the guest that you are ignoring...   Come on Scottsdale you can do better than this.",

This was my first time here and when I walked in immediately I felt a much more welcoming atmosphere than that of Paradise or Panera, which everyone seems to compare it to but in reality it's no contest. The counter staff was very friendly, particularly Alyssa was a delight. Having never been here before I was a bit indecisive and had a lot of questions, but she was wonderful and gladly answered all of my questions. She offered some great suggestions for me and ultimately I ordered the Chipotle Spinach salad, and boy am I glad I did. After the food came out which took absolutely no time at all I have to say honestly this is one of the best salads I've had anywhere in the Valley. Especially for the price, it's the best bang for your buck. I don't know what they put in that dressing but oh my God it is so delicious, which really I recommend if you're trying to eat healthy because I'm trying to cut carbs and that salad really hits the spot. And that says a lot considering the phenomenal smell of all the baked goodies here!! It was definitely tempting and you bet I'll be coming back here for more on one of my cheat days! I think I've found my new favorite spot.",

I wish I remembered to look at the girl's name who helped us the last time we stopped in. She was engaging, funny and not at all frustrated by the fact that we came in 10 minutes until close. (We were getting food to go and thought they were open until 10. We aren't usually THOSE people.) But like I said, she was cheerful anyway and had us laughing and smiling.  A huge plus is the variety! Lots of vegetarian options and it's always hard to decide what to get. I highly recommend the pasta primavera, hummus plate and the soup bread bowls!",

The food, breads and pastries are second to none, the consistency is excellent and their menu has many selections to choose from.  On top of this, everyone working there is extremely friendly and helpful.  They always greet you with a smile and appear to be enjoying themselves.  Unfortunately, one of  their newer  employees doesn't seem to be enjoying herself as much as everyone else.  She happens to work the register and is the first person, and impression, that the customer is given.  She always appears to be unhappy, disinterested and overall, rather grumpy.  We hate to see one employee ruin or tarnish the good experience everyone else brings to the company.  We would hope that bringing this to your attention will help rectify the situation.   Thanks for the great food and service.",

Not so bad, as I was looking for a light salad-type lunch. I ordered the chop-chop salad which was ok. The salad has wild Alaskan salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds served with Pesto Vinaigrette.   We also had the Emerald Spinach salad with chicken which was better. This salad has spinach, gorgonzola, bacon, red onion, spicy pecans, oranges, strawberries and red grapes with Balsamic Vinaigrette.   Ambiance note: There's a Yelp and Facebook ad on every table. Seriously, the ambiance was institutional and very chain-like. It's a baby magnet and the acoustics are horrible as the metal ceiling caused the noise to bounce all over making for a really loud place to eat.   Last, there's a bakery, but I honestly thought the bread was boring, bland and too tough of a crust.  This place may get a second chance, but only for take-out and no more Chop Chop salad. Portions are reasonable, but a far better salad is served at Paradise Deli with a lot more substance.",

My food arrived timely but it was cold. Nothing like having some cold eggs for breakfast! Naturally, that made the potatoes soggy. The turkey sausage... I don't know what in the world was on it but I couldn't eat it. It was incredibly unappealing and I reflected on what Gordon Ramsey would say at the sight of this fuzzy looking material on the patty... which only added to its rubbery texture.

Also, there are bakery items behind the glass counter. On both days I chose the cranberry scone, which was of the round, layered variety, which some might argue is not a traditional scone, but it was good, nonetheless.

    "text": "I'm never disappointed when I eat at a Wildflower.  It's a better version of Paradise Bakery with a feel free to stay all day if you like (but less pretentious) Starbucks vibe.  I also dig that one of the founders of the company emailed me to address some of my critiques of another location, even though the review was generally positive.  It's great to see that they're paying attention to their customers.  There's a great selection of sandwiches, salads and baked goods.  For the sandwiches I think the secret is in the simplicity and quality.  Most of them don't have more than three or four ingredients, but they seem to put together the perfect combination between those two slices of fresh baked bread.  My wife's caesar salad may have been one of the tastiest caesar salads I've ever tried.  This location also has a few cool things going for it.  There are power outlets under many of the booths, making it convenient for computer and tablet users to do whatever they are doing as they enjoy their drinks and meals.  Like other locations, there's the standard lounge near the front of the restaurant that's a perfect place for waiting for take out orders, or for coffee drinkers to hang out in a more open setting.  And this Wildflower also has a private party room in the back, which is also nice if you have a big group.  If you're anywhere nearby, Wildflower Bread Company is certainly worth a try.",

The BLT is my favorite,  thick bacon and \"always fresh\" avacado.  The Lobster Bisqe is the real deal with large chunks of meat in it. It's so good I eat it for breakfast.   This particular location has a great patio when the weather allows and the pandora stations they play only slightly suck. Indoors each booth has power outlets and people are always busy working away. How cool is that.   Yea it's corporate and a chain but lower your nose, it rocks.   The ice tea is amazing, I always buy a bag to brew at home. Delicious!",

For years, I used to eat at Wildflower monthly for Board meetings in their conference room and I always looked forward to the salmon salad with green goddess dressing.  Wildflower is also my go-to place for soup.  I'm giving Wildflower five stars for the value.  OK, it's not La Tour d'Argent but the food and friendly atmosphere are fantastic for the price.  Great if you live here as I do or are on vacation.  I'd think it's a great location for kids being right across from the train park but also it has a relaxed family feel complete with a perfectly lovely patio so the family can be outdoors.  You have to try it at least once.  Oh, and the breads are seriously made and seriously good.",

I also ordered a cup of mushroom barley soup...that came with no mushrooms? I asked the server and she even seemed perplexed so she went to check with the kitchen. She came back and said I had the right soup...it was a veggie soup with barley. Good but NOT something that should be named after an ingredient that was nonexistence.  Meh.",

Hats off to management who trains and develops it staff in basic manners, friendliness, patience, and timeliness in their duties.  My wife and I both chose from the salad menu and both were extremely satisfied with the combination of ingredients and recommend salad dressings, the bread is done the right way. Panera gets all the publicity though Wildflower \"ownes\" Panera in this market and could challenge them nationwide though, why not stay local and be the best in your segment? Keep up the amazing outcomes your guests expect and appreciate !",

I went to the back of the line to order and was expecting a bit of a wait, but the line moved right along. Three cashiers were taking orders and that explained the efficiency. I set our order flag on our table and went back to get our drinks and coffee and by the time I made it back to our patio table our food was arriving just ahead of me. Wow that was a pleasant surprise! Our lunch was as delicious as it always is and I was reminded why Wildflower is one of my very favorite restaurants!

What I first considered to be just another chain, has proved it's quality and provided plenty a pleasant dining experience both when dining solo and in groups.  Due to this convenient WBC location, I've been here quite a few times over the past few weeks, and I always leave satisfied!    Lately I've been a fan of their chopped salad and chicken salad.  I'm currently eating for two and their portions are large enough to fill me up.  The bread is fresh and delicious.  I'm also a fan of their lemonade but I wish they offered refills.    While I enjoy the fast-casual concept of ordering at the counter and having your food delivered to you, this seems to be a hot spot during lunch and it's sometimes challenging to find a table.  I'm sure it will be better once the weather cools down a bit so people can take advantage of the patio seating.  I learned today that this location also has a dining area that can blocked off for more \"private dining\" for groups.  I may just have to look into that in the future.  Keep up the good work, WBC - I'm sure I'll see you again soon.",

Every time we are in AZ we eat at Wildflower because it is one of my favorite quick stops for good food and healthy options.  We ordered dinner, I had the Superfood Salad, and my husband had a turkey sandwich. The food came quickly and was delicious as always. During dinner we decided that we would get dessert on the way out, but after we finished it was 8:10 and the restaurant had already closed. We asked if we could still get dessert and we were told by the cashier that the register was already closed. Frank came over and not only offered us dessert by because the register was closed he said we could pay for them the next time we came in. We had cash so we were able to pay but were impressed by his awesome customer service and professionalism. The only downside of every visit to Wildflower, is that there aren't any in CA and we have to wait until the next time we are in AZ. Maybe some day hopefully they will expand to our area!",

On a whim I made a last minute decision to grab lunch there and loved it! The atmosphere was wonderful and even though the place was full for a Sunday lunch it didn't seem too loud or overwhelming. The selection was more interesting than Panera. I chose an open faced Chicken Parm sandwich. The homemade marinara was incredibly flavorful and I enjoyed the added touch of mushrooms and arugula. Normally Chicken Parm that isn't breaded tastes dry and dull but this was the opposite!  My only complaint would be that they have a delicious looking pasta menu that doesn't start until 3. I originally wanted to order the Herb Linguini but it was only 12:30. I didn't see that listed on their menu anywhere and it would be helpful to have that listed.   On my way out I saw some amazing looking bagels. I ended up getting some, but they didn't have a dozen deal listed anywhere. It would be nice to have a dozen price listed instead of just $1.29 each. They're delicious enough that I'll still come back for more! Definitely recommend it for anyone on any sort of diet or who has dietary restrictions as well.",

I had ordered the ruben sandwich and had also ordered the mac and cheese thinking it was a side not knowing it was an entree. Frank brought  the meal and later returned to see if I knew about the mac and cheese. I told him no and he took it off the bill and brought me a box for home. What a pleasant surprise. Along with great food and people who actually care about customers I will definitely be back!",

They always make sure we are completely satisfied with the entire service experience. Our food is always prepared quickly and to perfection. We especially appreciate the fact that Jim, the Manager makes sure this location is spotless and  the day to day operation always runs smoothly. Love this place!",

He said he would replace it with any salad that I wanted. I ordered the Strawberry Salad. It was delicious. The manager can over and asked was everything. We come to Scottsdale once a year and always need eat here and enjoy the delicious food and the outdoor patio.",

    "text": "Glad to have a Wildflower location open up by my work. It's a good alternative to Paradise Bakery. The two have pretty similar concept. They just opened up here about a month ago and I have probably grabbed lunch here 8-9 times already. My favorites are the cream cheese potato soup and the wildflower salad. I usually get the wildflower two (choose two from any: soup, salad, or half sandwich) Also the blackberry/orange lemonade is really good. I've tried two different sandwiches and thought they were okay. What brings me back each time is that potato soup! The sourdough bread that comes with it is good as well.",

    "text": "Wildflower bread company is such a wonderful restaurant. I pop in for a quick meal fairly often as I live across the street. The ingredients are always fresh, healthy, and delicious! You order at the counter and then sit wherever you like and they bring your food out to you. The staff is always extremely polite and eager to help, which is great  to see. The restaurant is decorated with beautiful blown glass artwork by Newt Grover. The style is casual but still very nice. There is a great patio and plenty of seating indoors as well. There are fresh made breads and pastries daily that are yummy! I like to take the children I nanny here when we are headed to the train park as an alternative to the food there, as it is very conviniently located across the street. They enjoy sharing the meatballs and grilled cheese, as well as the fruit bowl. My favorite dish- the Sausage & Egg Sandwich, which has scrambled eggs, sausage, green onion, roasted red pepper, cheddar and cilantro on a buttered Ciabatta Roll... It's only 4.89, which is about what you might spend at a fast food restaurant on breakfast so why not stop by here and get something delicious instead?! It's always big enough for me to take half of it home too, which is wonderful to look forward to later. ;)",

Plenty of electrical outlets and wifi make it a good place to work and nibble on the free bread samples and get coffee'd up while waiting. I've been unable to tear myself away from the feta and tomato eggs, I love the way the flavors play off each other. And the bread is great, tastes like someone actually baked it. And there's always more coffee... With Jacqueline's gone, it's my go-to breakfast meeting location in this part of town (or Coffee Roastery...)",

    "text": "Went for lunch today, first time ever. I looked at the menu beforehand so I knew that I was going to order the grilled cheese. Upon arrival, the parking lot was jammed full, took me a loop around before I could even park. It was very crowded but the line wasn't too long. The girl was nice when I ordered-it was odd that they don't have regular iced tea (she DID offer to give me a cup with hot tea and ice though-I declined) oh And she Asked me if i wanted utensils, as thought i was expected to slurp up my potato salad with my fingers or something...that was really weird. anyway, it took FOREVER to get my order (to go) I even had to go up and ask if my order had gotten lost..now sitting down to eat, everything looks decent. My grilled cheese tastes pretty good, but the bread, 9-grain, almost broke my tooth on all the grains. And the arugula was a little soggy (probably due to the wait time)The potato salad was delicious though, I'd definitely want more of that. I'll have to switch sandwich types if I ever go back though.",
