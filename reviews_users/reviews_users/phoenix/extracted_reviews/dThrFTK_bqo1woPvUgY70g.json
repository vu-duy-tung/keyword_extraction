The Location is great and the court yard area is wonderful but with that said you have to have great food and staff to back it!  The service was so slow,  the dishes were dirty, and they never came to clear the plates when we were finished.  It seemed like they just were not well trained. The pizza we ordered was just ok our burger came out well done when we ordered it Medium  and the ceaser salad was the blandest worst salad I have ever tasted..   Very over priced for what it is and the options you have to choose from, Maybe this will just be a drinking happy hour place..   - MNSS Review team",

Our server was clueless and the reason for the 3 stars.   When spending fair money know your role and craft.  When you open a bottle of wine, it is custom to pour a small sample to taste.  Then you pour the the table.  You never just drop the check without asking if dessert  is wanted.   Basic service skills were lacking.   Will probably go back because I like the food, but tonight service makes me need to take pause, service is key in a service business.",

    "text": "Visited tonight with a friend.  Upon arriving, I said we should look around.  The attentive host offered a quick tour and we were both impressed by the various and thoughtful spaces for parties and events.  We chose the patio for dinner (gotta love Arizona in December!) and there were several patio heaters that kept us warm.    So, the food:  We tried the warm olive appetizer and cheese plate.  Both were generous portions, very tasty and we did not finish either portion.  We also ordered the mushroom pizza and found it to be very tasty.  Our server, Alyssa, was very attentive and helpful.    So a small criticism may be in order:  I think the entree prices, aside from the pizza prices, are a bit high by 2-3 dollars but they've made a nice investment in our neighborhood, so I guess it is justified, but I'd prefer more affordable entree options.",

We came on Friday at 6:30pm w no reservation. With a cold drink and good company, we didnt notice the wait time. A reservation is recommended if you dont want to wait. Food was magnificent. We ordered the bruschetta, they are big and you pick 3 flavors. They were excellent. The margherita pizza. The chefs platter, SO good by the way, and the spinach dip. We had a group of 6 and the food was plenty. Table service was friendly, bartender was kind of dry, not too friendly, just an observation, didnt affect my experience, but wasnt very inviting. People at the bar offered to move over so we could congregate in the bar. It was a friendly vibe. Ambience was nice, it was like a very upscale chain restaurant. Decor and colors were great, but the vibe was still very California pizza kitchen, but the food wasnt, food was much better. The bathroom was cute, good foot photo opp. If you know what I mean, high five . (Cute tile, cute saying, cute photo with cute shoes) didnt get dessert, but would totally next time. Pomelo's was delightful",

Pros: Beautiful place, excellent food, live music although I don't know if this is reoccuring.   Cons: Parking sucks. We parked around the corner in a neighborhood. Service is all over the place. Friendly but discombobulated. Lipstick on the glass (stuff happens, no biggie), forgot an appetizer, and just seemed really confused.",

Four of us arrived in the early evening to a very welcoming staff & were seated on the patio right away. Wings were great & the Polenta Cakes were just ok. We ordered two pizzas and they were both yummy especially the Pepperoni.   The service needs some refinement. We waited longer than usual for just about everything.  Also wet wipes & appetizer plates with wings would be appreciated.   My hopes is they will work out the service kinks soon. Would love to give our neighborhood restaurant five stars, it just wasn't to that level the night of our dining experience.   All the best Pomelo!!!  Worst parking situation now that Luci's is open. Thursday evening & no where to park. Can't imagine the parking on a weekend. Not many alternatives, plan on riding your bike here.",

Again not the servers fault, she was filling in for someone who didn't show up I guess. Food came out cold, they fixed it and I thought it was going to turn around. Then it came time to pay...still waiting which is really the only reason I'm leaving a bad review. Depending on how long it takes this may turn into a short story, perhaps a novel, maybe the literary equivalent in length to war and peace. I've been in restaurants for a lot of years...the situation flat out could have been handled better. I've spent a total 45 minutes of my life now at this point just waiting for someone to take my money.  To end the note: Teriana, 5 stars...Sunday brunch 0 stars.",

We had a calamari/shrimp appetizer that was tasty but small. The burger and fries were good and the dinner salads were satisfying, wish there was some crispy bread especially since there must be a blistering pizza oven somewhere in there!   I look forward to Pomelo developing their website and answering their phone and for the service to get more experienced, smooth and professional. Although the menu is pretty basic, we're going back to enjoy the beautiful space and watch The Orchard grow!   PS - There's a big parking lot at the back of the restaurant, so just keep driving back.",

She checked in frequently, but not to frequently. She was awesome! I teach customer service for a living, lucky for this restaurant we are not currently hiring or I would have given her a card. Phoenix is a foodies paradise. But what you do not always find us awesome customer service. Pay Jess well. Or you will lose her!!",

    "text": "I'm hopeful I'll return to give a higher rating -- not because I expect free food, but because of their response.   This place is beautiful! And it's very convenient, situated between where I work and the assisted living residence where my father lives.   I had one fun experience with 20 or so people in a big party. Our food took forever but no one even noticed because it was so much fun. It was only as we were leaving, remarking to each other about how long we'd been there.   My second experience was with my wife, and it was bad. There were kids yelling and screaming in the courtyard. We asked very politely if there was anything they could do, and we felt the response from our server was dismissive and rude. (As parents of four boys 13, 6, 6 and 4, we're pretty tolerant, but we were on date night, trying to enjoy some peace.) The food was passable, but not what we remembered from the night of the party.  I took my father there a few months later, because I often go to Lucy's for breakfast and it's right by his home. I asked the server to surprise me with a signature dish and I gave her some parameters about what I like and was in the mood for (something hearty and savory). She brought me french dip which was blah. The bread seemed like cheap white processed bread, the meat did not taste bad, but it was room temp and not particularly tasty. I asked for a second cup of dip heated up really hot. That helped a bit. My dad hardly tasted his salmon, but didn't say anything. I only noticed when we were ready to leave and I asked to try it. It tasted fishy -- not fresh. Our server was very happy and nice, but a bit over-tasked. Perhaps they had more people than they expected for a summer evening mid-week.  It's a shame because it is so quaint and the setting is outstanding -- and it's in my 'hood.   The reason I will come back is their response. I am starting to write reviews, but it's not my habit. However, I received a \"semi-spam\" automated invitation to something, and responded just on a whim, expecting it to end up in an unattended mailbox. Instead I got a very nice response.   I don't expect things will turn around on a dime, but I will be back. Their response gave me heart that they're listening, and I choose to assume they're striving to improve because they invested in responding. I'll try again in the fall and let you all know how it goes.",

This third visit was a large group and we had a private dinning area.  Other two visits were two of us.  The prices are a bit higher then average, but the food quality and quantity more then make up for the slightly higher price.

We were not given any plates for our salads or appetizer.  Water was never refilled.  My salmon was undercooked but there was no one to be found to flag down, so I ate around the raw center.

    "text": "We should have read the other reviews before deciding to try Pomelo.  We are fans and regulars of Luci's and visit nearly every week.  We arrived at around 4:30 p.m. on a Saturday because we wanted to avoid the Saturday night dinner crowd, especially because we would be dining with a child.  Because we dine early, we are sensitive to arriving at a shift change when service might be light.  We were seated and that was pretty much it.  We waited and waited.  Because we were in the middle of the restaurant, I could see various servers pass by.  A few even made eye contact.  No one stopped by our table to greet us or to let us know someone would be with us shortly.  By this time, another family arrived and were seated outside.  When I saw that this family had been served their drinks, including an iced tea, I started to get impatient.  When it appeared they were ordering, I informed the hostesses we had not been served since we arrived. Problem solved, right?  Nope.  I watched as one of the hostesses went into the kitchen where the servers were, and it seemed like we would now be served.  Nope.    That's when we left.  On the way out, we ran into the person who appeared to be the manager and informed him we were leaving because we had yet to be served since we arrived.  To his credit, he was very apologetic, offered us a free meal, and offered to serve us personally.  These are all great gestures, but with the frustration that had been caused, we chose to leave and eat at home.    If I had read through the other reviews and saw that this was an abnormal experience, we might have thought about giving it another try and skipped this review.  It's very disappointing to see all of the reviews where this or something similar had previously occurred since it opened about a year ago.  There were even reviews where the experience seemed to have been worse.  I also think about all of the other diners who may have had a similar experience but didn't post a review.  One would think after reading a couple of these reviews, the issues would have been addressed.  Perhaps this review will help improve the service or at least save others from a similar experience.    With all that Pomelo could offer in such a beautiful location and for the sake of other diners, I hope they are able to find staff who are happy and eager to create a positive experience for all who dine there.",

We're going back next month and will sit inside - then my review will likely warrant four stars.",

Everyone is so friendly and accommodating. We had a group of 7, and I was impressed by the service and food! We were also given a private room because they saw our party was on the larger side. The green room is perfect! We were asked if we wanted music and if the level was okay. The staff pays attention to the details which we all appreciated! They were also happy to split our check at the end which makes it a lot easier for all of us (even though it's more work on their end).  I feel bad I can't remember the hostess and server's names, but I remember their hair (brunette with short hair and a blonde with shoulder length hair). They were phenomenal!   We can't wait to come back again! I'm dying to try the brunch menu next.",

They all seemed to truly enjoy working at Pomelo and their joy extends to their customer interactions.  We were greeted by a very cheerful and friendly host.  And our server (Christy) was awesome!  She expertly guided us through the menu and again, was a pure joy to interact with! The food was fantastic.  Only minor call-out would be the calamari, which just didn't seem as fresh and therefore, didn't match up with the rest of our meal.  The Brussel Sprouts totally lived up to the billing!  Amazing! I had the Salmon and at Christy's suggestion, had it grilled and blackened - wow!  My wife ordered the Short Ribs and they too were incredible!   The entire experience, including the beautiful, warm and inviting surroundings of Pomelo and The Orchard - just awesome!  Can't wait to return.  Kudos to ownership for hiring & training well, and for creating a work environment where your employees clearly come to have fun!",

One of the other women at my table ordered the same thing but they brought her one that she had not ordered as you get 3.  She mentioned to our waitress who just ignored her and did not offer to exchange it for what she had ordered.  The service was poor and it took forever for them to bring my order.  Everybody was almost done when I finally got mine.  Then to top it all off they charged everybody in our group and extra $8 for some sort of an extra fee which was unexpected and really uncalled for. They never told us beforehand that they were going to do this. This turned me and many others off.  Had been planning to give it a try sometime for happy hour but no longer.'  One of our ladies ordered a mixed drink which they served her in a plastic glass instead of a real glass.  The best thing is the outside courtyard for dining.  Nice atmosphere.  Otherwise, it would be zero stars.",

    "text": "Wife and I tried this place the other day. The interior is really well done. The wood work (trim) is impressive. I ordered a Pomelo Spicy Mule, it was good, different, you could certainly taste the hatch green chili, very good. My wife ordered the Roasted Chicken $18.00  HA! It came to the table and it was a sample piece of chicken. I am not being dramatic, no exaggeration. An entire roasted chicken just about everywhere is at the most $5.99 I'm thinking Costco, any Fry's, perhaps Safeway, a complete whole chicken! This was 2 bites, I didn't want to say anything negative about what she ordered until she couldn't believe what a tiny morsel of food she had in front of her. I ordered the Steak Salad $18.00. It was a small handful of lettuce, excuse me \"field greens\" and some steak. This could have been a house salad it was so tiny. At this point the wife asked,  \"where do you want to go eat?\" I was really disappointed, field greens! Put some in a bowl!! The waiter was polite, even though he seemed like he was serving us something to be proud of. I should have got the burger. If you want fancy food and professional wait staff, visit here, if you want a snack this is your place.",

    "text": "Went there the other evening for happy hour with a friend.   I go to Luci's, which is in The Orchard and owned by the same owners, all the time for coffee with friends, but decided to try Pomelo's for happy hour since I've never done so prior.  We sat at the bar.  Jeremy was our bartender/server.   I did a taste testing of the red wine on their happy hour menu:  the Monttpelier Pinor Noir and the Los Cardos Cab.  UGHHH!     My friend had the Drumheller chardonnay also off the happy hour menu.   UGHHH!!   Since I like manhattans, I decided to have that instead.  I was told the whiskey used, albeit in a manhattan is not on the happy hour menu and I would have been charged more, was \"top shelf,\" and I was led to believe was a decent one.   Uhmmm.  My head said NO!!  The next day I had a raging headache, a sure sign of cheap booze.   How many manhattans did I have?    Two.   Not anything out of the ordinary.    For food we had the calamari and the spinach dip appetizers from the happy hour menu.   Both were good.  No complaints here.     I would LOVE to LOVE this place since it's locally owned and somewhat close to where I live.   The drinks?   I'd have to order off the regular menu if I was going to have decent wine or drinks.  Does that make it happy hour friendly?   Not for me, but I'd go here all the same.   Jeremy is a great bartender, very professional, accommodating, and friendly.  A truly great addition to this establishment.",

    "text": "Previously a garden shop and nursery, the same team that opened Luci's Healthy Marketplace has done wonders in turning this into a night spot and restaurant. Because we had a large group, we got the private room at the restaurant. We started with the calamari and shrimp fritti appetizer which was excellent. My 13-year-old went for the margarita pizza and loved the flavors and the basil. My 10-year-old had the kids chicken fingers but switched out the French fries for the roasted garlic mashed potatoes. My mother-in-law and I both had the orchard pork chop with the vegetables and roasted garlic mashed potatoes. My father-in-law ordered the half rack of bbq ribs. I don't even remember what my brother-in-law and his husband ordered (paella maybe?) but we all agreed that everything was delicious and there was very little food left on our plates at the end of the meal.  The service and atmosphere was great as well. Our server, Jessica, was there when we needed her but unobtrusive and professional. She interacted quite well with everyone at the table from the kids to the adults. As for the location, I loved what they have done with the place, there's plenty of room for dining, a full bar, and plenty of parking out back, and even though it was hot, there appeared to be sufficient misters for anyone who might want to sit out on the patio between the various locations including an ice cream shop and a coffee house. This will definitely be a place to which I will be returning. It's a great addition to the North Central Phoenix area.",

Salad was tasteless and we weren't halfway through before our entree appeared. Felt like we were at Chili's! Entrees were ok but the staff started cleaning up as though they were very eager to go home while five tables were seated, some not having even ordered yet. A bus boy propped the front door open in 40-degree weather in order to sweep the lobby and then left it open after putting his broom away. After several minutes, we asked our server if she could please close the front door since it's a small place and was getting very cold, and she said \"if he's done sweeping.\" As if to say his sidework was more important than the customers' comfort while dining? We specifically asked her not to bring out our desserts yet, as we felt we were being seriously rushed through our dinner experience. Once we were finally enjoying our desserts, the staff turned the lights all the way up in the dining room--with four tables still eating their entrees at 9:30pm. I've never felt more shoved out the door in my life--and at a place that ADVERTISED its special NYE dinner! The meal was not worth the $60 and we felt extremely rushed.",

We've been wanting to try it for awhile but never had a chance because of it not being open during the times we have gone and we ended up going to it's counterpart (Luci's). There was a rehearsal dinner going on in the middle of the courtyard which gave me some cute ideas. We were able to get right in w parking at 7:45pm (no valet). We also probably didn't need to make a reservation (even though it was Friday). We ordered the street corn and Brussels sprout apps. I ordered the salmon and my husband ordered the pork chop. Our friend got a salad with salmon. Staff was very attentive. The salmon was cooked perfectly. My favorite thing was that it wasn't overcrowded and stuffy. My least favorite thing was that they were out of the Mahi dish that I really wanted to order. Overall, very comfortable and easy going.",

    "text": "Unfortunately, this was our first time eating at the Pomelo, and it happened to be for New Year's eve. They featured The Prix Fixe menu at $60 per person which included a glass of champagne, a starter salad, and your choice of 8-10oz lobster tail or an 8oz filet and dessert, or you could order from other menu selections. My sister and I decided to each order from the fixed menu so we could split the lobster [her] and steak [me].  I ordered my steak medium rare, and it came medium well. Not only that, to both of us the steak tasted fishy/spoiled and it was very dry. I mentioned it to our waitress, and she said she would let her kitchen know. The appetizers were great - calamari and artichoke dip. Everyone else seemed pleased with their entrees: pork chops, salmon and braised short ribs ribs (a little dry). Dessert was also very good. The waitress never again acknowledged our dissatisfaction with the steak, even when she collected our plates and there was still quite a bit of steak left. My son is a server, so I hate to cause a big fuss knowing he has to deal with difficult people, so I didn't push the issue. I guess that's my fault. However, I may wait a while and try this establishment again, if ever. Customer service didn't seem to be a priority.",

The setting is beautiful starting with the open walkway and outside seating throughout the surrounding buildings.   As for the food, we started with fried shrimp and calamari which was delightful. The calamari was cooked to perfection which is always a mighty task. We also ordered the baked olives which were tasty however they were just olives warmed up in a small cast iron skillet with oil and garlic. I would recommend adding a side of the grilled banquette they pair with the chefs stone.   For our meals we ordered the Pork Chop (Fantastic!), the House Pizza (Good but pretty spicy / I like spice!), the Mushroom pizza topped with Arugula (good share addition to the table) and the Chef's Stone (appetizer, I think they call it that). All of them were good however the Chef's Stone was overpriced for what you get. Not only that but the plate presentation was a little underwhelming for the $22.00 price tag. I suppose they are hoping people share the tag and the app with smoke and mirrors. Who knows!?   The service seemed a little slow and maybe new but they were smiling and polite so I cannot complain. I will be back.   Also, for my Wife's birthday they did treat us to a piece of chocolate cake with some vanilla caramel with sea salt dessert.  Note : Go on the days where they have Pizza and a Bottle of Wine for $20.00. Now that's a deal!",

The restaurant is very charming and in a lovely setting, plenty of parking, too. Can't say we experimented much with the menu, just pizzas and salad. In the past, we've have their caesar which was great. Unfortunately, it's not on the menu, probably due to the E coli break out. Hope it comes back. We did see hamburgers go by and they also looked delish. Our Yelp check-in was honored for dessert. Yummy creme brulee.",

The courtyard has a lot of greenery and would be a relaxing setting in cooler weather.   The atmosphere in the restaurant is somewhat sterile. The design is simple and safe. With the acoustics and the amount of families, the volume was pretty loud. The vibe certainly seems more yoga mom than hipster.   The staff seemed a little stiff and lacking personality, but there was nothing overtly negative to say about service.   The food is what earns four stars. I had the beet salad and my husband had the crispy chicken sandwich. The portions are modest, but the cooking technique, freshness, and flavor all shine.   All in all, give it a chance.

Unfortunately the evening went downhill pretty fast - a hamburger ordered rare and cooked well done, a second glass of wine ordered and arriving after we had been presented with our check, a check that had errors and took forever to get resolved.  The food is mediocre at best, the service is spotty and we will not return anytime soon.  To our server's credit, he did comp the overlooked hamburger but at that point, our perception of this restaurant is great potential but the staff is not trained and the little things that make a difference between average/below average and what makes you want to come back are missing.  Too bad is our assessment.",

They were having a holiday party so the grass area was off limits so we ended up at the restaurant.  First off when we were seated they handed us the happy hour menu so we chose what we wanted and when we ordered it our waitress told us we can't order for the HH menu since we were sitting outside so I said \"ok, then why did you give us the HH menu?\" She said it's the only menu they have with their cocktails listed on it and what's in them.  So that was really annoying.  Then later I asked for a knife for our fig spread, granted we had no utensils or napkins at all, and she came back with a spoon and said they didn't have anymore knives...wow, really?!?! So we had our bottle of wine corked and paid the bill and left.  They just didn't seem to be very accommodating or professional overall it definitely did not leave a good impression.",

Long story short, we probably won't be back. The food wasn't bad, but the service was absolutely horrible.  Our server was so slow that he almost seemed lost or confused. Our food came before our drinks even though we ordered drinks well before our food. Nothing came out together and we had to ask multiple times for various items. We tried to enlist the help of someone who appeared to be a manager, but she seemed annoyed that we had the audacity to even say anything. She basically didn't listen to what we said and snapped back that she was \"on it\". Let me tell you she was anything but \"on it\". She was flat out rude. Overall the entire experience was a bust and slightly embarrassing considering we took friends there from out of town.",

Someone made a cruel comment about \"the lady in the gray dress\" I too was there and saw her...

    "text": "I SOOO wanted to enjoy the experience more than we have on two of the three occasions we've been here for dinner. The grounds are lovely and the concept fresh, but food and service so inconsistent that it's hard to know what to expect.   Our telephone contact for reservations was super all three times! Really, here's an area where the management really shines, as in giving warm and welcoming first contact. Unfortunately, not so warm and welcoming after that, although we were greeted pleasantly and seated promptly, which isn't always so easy to accomplish.   We had reservations for six at six o'clock to accommodate finals-week schedules of the teens in our family, so I'm not thinking we just hit the staff at the end of an exhausting holiday-week dinner shift. Short story: (1) 10-15 minutes before any contact with a server and that only b/c we flagged down the hostess as she whizzed past, (2) absolutely no overview of the menu or personal interaction with our server, mainly menus passed out and orders jotted down, (3) no follow up or even eye contact during dinner, (4) no suggestion of coffee or dessert, which we might have considered since this was a birthday dinner. However, by then we were sliding into indifference, so left a modest tip and zipped off for hugs in the parking lot. The front desk staff was busy when we left, so the server, possibly inexperienced and certainly not-so-well-trained, may have wondered why we didn't recognize her efforts.   The most pleasant interaction of the evening was with a guy who delivered some of our dishes and chatted up our 14-year old about where on earth he was planning to put that gigantic hamburger! He even paused a moment later in the meal to express amazement at the clean plate. This 2-minute exchange was more what you might expect from a nice mid-range restaurant.   The food was okay, nothing special, and certainly nothing to compare with the setting. Pomelo, and certainly The Orchard as a whole, potentially has more to offer than some of the restaurants only a bit further south on 7th street, where both food and service keep us coming back. I haven't given up on Pomelo, but will be awhile til we try again.",

I have ordered it every time I've been there (which has been 4 times in less than 2 weeks.) Also, the food is good. Nothing crazy outrageous amazing, but very good. I've had the spinach dip, the wings (really saucy, but great grilled) and the burger with fries. Staff are very friendly and abundant. The hostesses have been overly positive and pleasant. We've had super slow service a few times, but I expect that in the first month when a place is trying to get their flow figured out. I would like to think that this place will do well for a long time if they get their service/food times figured out. The neighborhood has been dying for a cute spot like this! I can't wait for the other places to open up at The Orchard. We can walk to this place from our house, so it  will be a popular destination this summer for ice cream and splash pad. Try to Uber/Lyft there on busy nights...the parking lot fills up and you may have to park on a nearby street. I heard that some folks in the area are already upset about cars parking on their streets, but there isn't much they can do about it.",

We had good service and enjoyed our meals so decided to take out of state visitors on Sunday for a late lunch.  Terrible decision!  Seated promptly in the dining room, server brought water and took drink orders, two cokes, one iced tea and one Bloody Mary.  When three of the drinks were delivered we placed our food order.  The place was not crowded and it did not appear they were short of staff.  Nevertheless, our food, one omelette, one chicken sandwich, one tuna tartare and one chicken enchilada took nearly 45 minutes to be delivered.  Still no Bloody Mary.  And the server never appeared again until we looked for her to bring our check.  Finally a manager type person asked how our food was which was when we mentioned the Bloody Mary.  It was promptly delivered.  The food was fine, but the tuna tartare with guacamole was just not a good combination.    We will return, eat at the bar and enjoy their brunch menu, but will likely visit other places first.",

    "text": "Went for a quick lunch during a work day.  Mark was our server.  He took drink orders, delivered them promptly and left.  He never returned on his own to inquire about our lunch order.  Mark even walked back and forth past our table slowly, countless times - even making eye contact with us, but never stopping at the table.  I assumed he was a busser who just took the drink orders and that our server would be by to take our food order.  With 20 minutes of my lunch hour quickly disappearing and no food on the horizon I stopped a hostess who was cleaning the table next to us and asked if she could find whomever was our server and send them over to take our order.  Surprisingly the young man (Mark) who served our drinks shows up.  He took our order and left, never offering to refill our drinks or replace the cocktails with new ones.  After another 15 - 20min our food arrived (a cold vegetarian bruschetta board and an ahi tuna salad).  My two friends had mentioned that they intended to share the ahi salad when they ordered it, but no share plate was provided.  We had to ask the young lady who delivered the food to bring a plate.  Mark returned with a plate.  At this point - roughly 45 minutes into my lunch hour - I asked Mark for a refill on my iced tea and my check, explaining to him that I hadn't anticipated the lunch to take so long.  He returned with my check, but no iced tea.  Without making this review last too long, it took 4 reminders for Mark to bring me the iced tea.   Bottom line, the service was very slow and borderline awful.  Beyond that, the bruschetta board was not great.  All three selections were very dry(hence my persistence on an iced tea refill).  My friends enjoyed the ahi salad quite a bit.  Because neither the service, nor my food were anything worth re-living, I won't be back.  And I can't honestly recommend this spot to anyone.  Sorry!",

Then we shared the spinach dip. It was very good; cheesy, bubbly, and tastey. For dinner my Wife tried the pepperoni pizza and I ordered the burger with fries. Her pizza was the hit of the night. The pepperonis were crispy and the pizza had an excellent wood fired taste. My burger was just ok. It was a grass fed beef burger(which I have never had before) so maybe that was the reason it was lacking in flavor. I tried to put ketchup on each bite and that helped, I also tried sprinkling salt on it and it helped a little too. Maybe grass fed beef is not my cup of tea.  All and all we had a great experience! Service was on point and everything came out as ordered. I would like to go back and give them another try to make me something else.",

    "text": "I was looking forward to trying out this new place and have mixed feelings. The service was outstanding, food was delicious but the thing that really brought my review down is the ambient sound level. The dining room only holds about 50 people but I really had to strain to hear my friend across the table from me and felt like I was almost yelling to be heard. I'm not sure why this is such a reoccurring theme for restaurants...no thought to sound control. In any case, I think if I hadn't been there in the middle of the day, during the heat of the day, I would have sat outside and had a much better experience. Certainly something to try then I won't have to strain to hear and be heard while I enjoy a great meal.",

    "text": "Upon learning about our experience at Pomelo through a mutual friend, the owner personally reached out to my husband and I. He apologized for our experiences and mentioned a few reasons why his restaurant was not where it should have been. Owning my own business I know your only as good as your staff. He mentioned he had some staffing issues and since then he has personally focused on bringing the right people in to change the way they do things. He offered dinner on him just to go back and give it try. Just because we got a free dinner is not why I am changing my review. I'm changing it because not only did the owner personally reach out and try to make a wrong or right but we truly did have a wonderful experience going back.  The food was delicious and the atmosphere is always amazing. I let a few bad experiences make me believe it just wasn't a good restaurant but I was incorrect. I would refer this restaurant to anyone who is looking for an amazing place to experience amazing food with an amazing atmosphere. * excuse the typos",

    "text": "This was my 3rd or 4th visit. I've had a couple of good experiences in the past, but this night was the exception. As much as I enjoyed the food, the service was so-so. Our waitress was very sweet, but not very attentive. And we were NOT a high maintenance crowd? It took SO long just to get our water glasses after being seated. Then we didn't see our server for the longest time and wanted to start quickly with appetizers for those of us who were hungry.  When I asked another waitress if we could order appetizers, she was seemed a bit bothered and said she would get my server. A simple \"Yes! I would be happy to find your server and she will be right with you\" would have been nice. One of us ordered a glass wine as we were eating our appetizers. The wine did not arrive until he was halfway through his dinner. We had to ask where it was! How long does it take to bring one wine glass? Then the birthday boy requested a custom dessert....simply, vanilla ice cream with whipped cream on top, drizzled with chocolate sauce. The waitress went to check and said they ran out of ice cream and didn't have any whipping cream. (I'm sure he would have been happy with just the ice cream and chocolate sauce. Guess the kitchen couldn't handle that) She suggested we walk across the grass area to get ice cream at the gelato counter. Hmmmm, guess it was too much bother for our server to get more ice cream across the way. As we were getting ready to leave, someone asked for a container for 1/2 the ribs he didn't eat. She brought a container that barely fit one rib! And then she  disappeared so we decided to find a suitable container ourselves. Again, a very sweet person, but she and the other young female server I mentioned need some training in timing and checking back with us more frequently. If we decide to return I hope the service improves. There's nothing more annoying than trying to enjoy a birthday celebration with friends and having to search for your server.",

The wine we were served was a different year than the one on the menu, which isn't a bid deal, but we were literally laughed at when we asked about it. We had to ask to have our water refilled and another wine glass brought. Our server brought the check and we had to ask about dessert. He said them so fast that we had no idea what was being offered, so we paid and left. I can't imagine Pomelo lasting in this lovely location if this is the quality of experience it offers.",

Then, when I still had about an hour of my party left, the event staff started breaking down my party and moving it making my guests feel like that had to leave (which some did.) I understood another party was being set up for but then do not make my party part of that area, the situation could of been avoided! My fiance and I were so upset, we left and took our party down the street the the yard. I then reached out to the event coordinator to express my concerns and she told me she would get back to me then just never did. I am sure this place is great just for dining and mingling, but don't do a party here.",

After another 10 minutes, my server finally showed up and attempted to shift responsibility onto the chef, claiming that the chef ran out of the key ingredients for my dish. My server then claimed that he had attempted to pass this message on to someone else to inform me, but they did not.  Between all of this, I also reminded them I had not received the iced tea which had been taken away to be refilled.  The server flippantly shifted the blame upon one of my dining companions, saying that they must have taken my drink.   What an odd situation, I thought... Here I was waiting for my dish for much longer than expected, and it seemed that nobody was responsible for the wait... It was merely bad fortune, the server seemed to think.  The server then offered me an appetizer or a salad, I chose a salad, optimistically believing the restaurant would make it right and offer it on the house.  Not so, I learned later on.  In the end, I waited an hour for an overpriced salad and had to deal with a server who missed the mark on an opportunity to salvage the experience.",

Had to take our check up the host since our waiter never came back to our table once the food came. Food was okay at best. Beet salad was decent,  french dip had very little meat on it.

I'm guessing the fries are made fresh in-house and not frozen which was much appreciated.  Service was very good.  In fact, there were a ton of servers and assistants taking care of the guests and anticipating your needs instead of waiting to be asked for small things like drink refills.  This was very impressive.  The only thing that I wasn't wild about was how loud the dining room was during my lunch.  There are a lot of hard surfaces in the dining room and the sound really reverberated.  All in all it was a nice experience.

    "text": "This is an update to my previous review. Awhile back I was invited back by Pomelo's to try the Chilaquiles again so hubby and I decided to go for brunch today. We were greeted promptly and were quickly lead to a corner booth which was perfect. We both decided to take advantage of their $5 Bloody Mary's. They were very good although a tad bit spicy for my taste. Hubby loved his though! I ordered the Chilaquiles and hubby ordered the French dip with french fries. This time around the Chilaquiles were 100% better. The pork was very tender and flavorful and I had no problem cutting it with a fork. The eggs were nice and fluffy and I liked finding the potatoes on the bottom that I hadn't even noticed before. There was just the right amount of salsa and sour cream layered on top and before I knew it I was stuffed. Hubby's French Dip was very tasty. The meat was cooked perfect and the roll was very soft. The french fries were nice and crispy and piping hot. We both very much enjoyed our brunch and we will definitely return as I would love to try the Ahi Tuna and the French Toast next time around!  Previous Review below:  I went here with one of my meet up groups for brunch. I'm really sad to have to do it but I have to honestly say that it just wasn't that great. Two of us ordered the Chilaquiles and I ended up sending mine back as it was inedible. The pork was so bad. It was tough and fatty and the gristle made me need to spit it out in my napkin. It  did not feel or taste like it had been hardly cooked at all. So I went ahead and ordered their breakfast pizza and that was pretty good. One of my friends had ordered the breakfast enchiladas and she said they were not very good either and were not something she would ever order again. The $5 cocktails they have for brunch (mimosas and white sangria) were very tasty though! The waitress we had was very nice as was the manager who came out to apologize for the chilaquiles. So I don't know as if I would return to this place for brunch but I do feel like I would give it another try for lunch someday.",

The staff is very attentive, at least 4 people come up to make sure we were being helped when we were waiting for our table.   Tried the beet salad and Caesar salad. No flavor at all!!! No seasonings on anything on the salad or salad dressing of any kind on either, very disappointed! The Cesar was so bad I had to send it back.   The pizza was great though, we did the mushroom pie and it was amazing.  All in all we would come back but only for the pizza. If you try this place and venture for a salad, ask for extra dressing on the side! YOU WILL NEED IT!",

The toppings, sausage and onion, are full of flavor and pair well with their perfect mozzarella. Our server seemed to know exactly what we needed without being overbearing; the managers , Matthew and Michelle, were so kind and welcoming. Not sure you can do much better in the ambiance category than Pomelo- hands down the BEST patio in Uptown. Thanks for a great Friday date night. We will be back, soon!",

A nice sit down restaurant/bar with a phenomenal menu or a more laid back order at the counter and find a spot inside or out on the patio to relax. Beautiful grounds and lush scenery makes it a great place to hang out with the family or with friends and enjoy good food. Plenty of room for kids to run around and play complete with a splash pad and sweet shop too. What more can you ask for!",

It is definitely an awesome place to grab a bite... Not only the ambiance, courtesy of a nice patio with comfy chairs, but also, great their great service, & even greater food! I ordered the Pork Lollipops from the appetizer menu, and I was not dissapppointed at all. It was such a nice portion that I no longer needed a main dish. Very filling! It comes with an Arugula salad topping along with some very tasty orange-like Pepperocinis. I also got their street corn, which was very authentic, and off course a margarita. The Prickly pear is a very lovely pink color so it was not only delicious, but good to look at. Overall I had a nice time and would love to be back.",

It was very romantic and we didn't need our husbands to enjoy this evening! The managers stopped by to chat and check up on us. The restaurant had a relaxed and comfortable ambience. Our food was good! We had the calamari, spinach dip, Brussels sprouts, grilled corn for appetizers. We all enjoyed it except some of the portions were tiny, ie the corn. A few of the main dishes we tried were the mushroom pizza, shrimp fettuccine and the braised short rib. These three dishes tasted very good except the fettuccine got cold and hard quickly. But we still ate it all up. Our waitress was super friendly and patient. She dealt with our splitting of the checks with finesse. Lovely first time at Pomelo's. Will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I recently met some friends at Pomelo for dinner on a Sunday night. We arrived a little before 9 o'clock and were aware of the restaurant closing at 10. We planned to eat and visit, but not stay all night. I was very disappointed by how the wait staff rushed us along through the whole meal.... trying to clear drinks and food before we were finished with them. At one point, a busser/server rambled on to a co- worker about how tired he was as he cleared our table. Not long after that, the manager came out and babbled on to us about a 10:15 city ordinance and how we basically needed to leave....as though we were a loud table of drunks. He made sure to tell us it was 10...like you need to be out of here in 15 minutes...I was like really??? None of us had more than one drink and we were just enjoying regular conversation. I felt that was very unnecessary and rude. There is no excuse for treating customers that way. Maybe they should consider closing at 9 since customers showing up then irritate the staff. Neither my friends nor I have a desire to return since we were made to feel like a nuisance for going to eat at Pomelo.",

    "text": "Wow. Ordered two house pizzas and a Ceasar salad for take out. I found this place on Yelp, looking for anything new (and decent) in Phoenix to eat. I was surprised when I arrived to see where this joint was located. I had assumed it would be on the corner at the light but it was mid block. I must say they did a incredible job with the lighting and landscape of this place. I was even more impressed when I finally located the entrance -- by this time I'd walked the entire perimeter I think. Tip: don't park in front as you first turn into the lot, thinking you have hit the jackpot with being so fortunate to have pulled in at just the right moment... because the entrance to the restaurant is accessed from the rear p-lot. Lol.  I cannot comment on the service or staff, as I ordered my food for pick up. The girl that took my order when i called it in was plesant. I can say that the order was ready and waiting when I arrived and it was complete. There were no hang ups or mix ups. I give Pomelo five stars for the quality and taste of the food. Everything was perfect. Yes, I realize it was only pizza and a salad but... it was hands down, the best I've yet to have in Phoenix in my twelve years living in this city. Next time I will dine in and see if the staff and service measures up to the food they serve? I hope so.",

We saved our first visit for our father's day celebration.  We were a bit disappointed to say the least.  We had a reservation (great that they take reservations) yet we were offered the worst table in the dining room.  So we opted for the lounge area.  My daughter ordered the house burger and I had the spicy fettuccine.  My daughter's opinion of her burger was \"it was ok, not the best I've had, but not the worst either.\"  As for the fettuccine, it was tasty, but starchy and cold/Luke warm.  The meals were delivered in a timely manner.     Overall,  I was not sure who Pomelo's is trying to be.  The menu is not very creative or perhaps too creative, far too eclectic, with a limited selection and a bit pricy for the items on the menu.   The grounds are very impressive and promise far  more than what is offered.  Lucci's looked far more interesting than Pomelo's....next time.  One last thing,  as I said,  we went on father's day, not one person offered a \"Happy Father's Day\" wish. Not the hostess, the waiter,  the server,  or the owner/manager.      Please Pomelo's,  pay attention to the details!",

Even though they were quite busy, we were seated almost immediately.   The ambiance is fresh (upscale but casual) and their courtyard is open and inviting. Our server was killer! She had a great personality and was on her A-game the entire time.   Dinner was excellent. My brother's \"birthday burger\" was MASSIVE, my dad said his scallops were the best he's ever had and my Pesto Garden Pizza (add chicken and bacon) was perfection.   The only negative experience (during an otherwise 5 star evening) was in the attached ice cream shop (Splurge). I had noticed the server being abrupt with the customers ahead of us, so I wasn't too surprised to be rushed out the door as well. Strange because there was only one person behind us, yet it felt as if the line was out the door and it was closing time (which it wasn't). I asked if there was a flavor she could recommend that was popular and her response was \"Um...I dun-know.\" Then, my dad asked to sample the salted caramel. She kinda seemed put out and actually sighed when getting a spoon!! Yay. Anyhow, we all have bad days and maybe that was hers. Hoping that was just a one-off.   Overall, it was a GREAT evening for our entire family at Pomelo. Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Wow, this place is outstanding!  Ride by here daily on my way home from work (favorite Strava segment!), and it's always steadily busy. Perfect striking distance from our house, so we stopped in for lunch last Sunday.   Service was fantastic. Sat at the bar, and both bartenders were on top of it. Very friendly, patient and incredibly attentive. Never did a drink go dry, and we were even brought hot towels for clean up after annihilating some wings, without asking. You can tell when a restaurant puts an emphasis on training and service, and this crew was top notch. I'll have to see if they maintain that level of service when it's busier.  Food was really good, and came out pretty quick. Ordered a pizza, wings and a burger. Wings were absolutely perfect, best I've had in years. Tender, slightly crisp skin, and covered with just the right amount of quality sauce. No slick of red oil goo here. Pizza was very good. I'm very picky about pizza, but they do an exceptional job here. Crust was about the perfect thickness, not chewy at all, crisp on the outside and soft on the inside. Really good sauce, great cheese and awesome pepperoni. Reasonably sized and reasonably priced. Home run. The burger was fine, but I wouldn't order it again. It was a bit past medium, lacked flavor, and had a lot of stuff going on topping-wise, making it hard to eat. Certainly not bad, but forgettable. Fries were really good, however.  I'm not a hipster, but I do ride pretty much everywhere. Great to see good bike parking under the water tower. Overall vibe of the place is very interesting; lots of high quality work went into the construction and design. The bathrooms were really cool; lots of 1920's era touches that reminded me of some of the very old buildings/restaurants/train stations in KC or LA.   We will definitely be back, and I'm excited for the other plans they have for The Orchard. Really a cool place, lucky it's so close.",

My group ordered a variety of dishes and they all were delicious! Wings = tender and loaded with sauce  Pizza = sausage from Schreiners, house cheese blend was awesome!! Spicy fettuccine = spicy as advertised with noodles perfectly cooked Burger = huge amount of fries and burger perfectly cooked  Dessert= strawberry shortcake. Large enough serving to share 5 ways   Wonderful attentive servers.  Put that all together and it results in a great evening out!!",

    "text": "I really wanted to like this place. Based on the write up in The Phoenix New Times, we were really looking forward to eating and hanging out here.  The restaurant and grounds are beautiful. It's a new business, I think they may have opened to early, before working all the kinks out of their service. And please understand, I expected that to some degree but what I can't tolerate is negligent or rude service.   - The hostesses were rude and distracted and one was chomping on chewing gum while she was talking to us.  - there were several employees standing around the hostess stand in a frenzied state of confusion  - we were told it would be between 45 mins and 2 hours for a wait. Had a table not come avail while we were waiting on our friends, we would have left. The wait was about 45 mins which is acceptable  - while waiting we sat outside in the cocktail area to wait get drinks and apps. The server was very slow and rude. Based on this alone I would have left  - server inside was pleasant but after we sat and ordered we never saw him again. No one came by to check on us, to see how the food was or to refill drinks or for us to order cocktails.   Good idea on the concept and I hope you do well. Pizza was good, burger and fries were just okay. But average food and poor service make it hard to want to come back when there are so many good restaurants in Phoenix now.",

    "text": "I really wanted to write a fantastic review on this place.  Maybe my expectations were too high.    We arrived on a Monday at 1.  The hostesses were great... it was down hill from here...  Our waitress was slow... never really around... we looked around and it really was not that busy.  Our appetizer came out with our food :(  Nothing like dropping 18 dollars on the chef's cheese/meat plater to rush eating it in order to avoid a cold pizza.  Several olives fell off the plater due to the waitress being bumped by a co-worker. Her comment was \"oh it was just a few that fell\" - We assumed she would bring us back more olives... this never happened. :(   Lets talk about the pizza... aside the crust... it was awful.  It was the most flavorless margarita pizza I ever had.  It tasted as if a can of tomato sauce was poured on the dough and cheese and tomato added... extremely acidic and tart.  We also had to wait patiently... and I mean wait...  to ask for plates for our appetizer and pizza.  One Yelper wrote about the avoided eye contact - the entire wait staff has this.  It was as if they were afraid to help each other out.  Zero team effort.  So simple request like, \"may I have a plate for my food\" will go unanswered until your assigned waitress makes her way to you. :(   I'm going out on a limb of fairness... but maybe some of the entrees are better.  Regardless we will not be back.",

We were able to have the outside patio, which happened to be a very nice evening for June in Phoenix. They had the misters going as well but for once, it was not really needed (although they felt quite lovely) Our lovely server, who's name escapes me, was on top of things all night. I was even able to order off the kids menu (which sometimes restaurants won't let you do) as I didn't want a huge meal nor did I want to have to take home leftovers. Two delicious sliders and fries later along with two glasses of wine, and I was one happy customer. There were two ladies in our party that both ordered the lovely ribeye steak and they both raved about it. I swear if I was hungrier I would have definitely ordered it as it looked AMAZING!   The only issue was parking. You had to be quick in order to snag a parking spot as they are few and far between. I got very lucky as someone was coming out as I was coming in, but had that not have happened, I am not sure if I would have stayed as there really was no parking spots available. All in all, I will definitely be back again in soon!",

    "text": "First, and most importantly, the food is fantastic. The location is one of my favorites in the valley. The orchard is lovely and sitting on the patio is my favorite.  I tried Pomelo's with a friend a few months ago and I've been back four times since then. The food rates five stars, and I don't often go there. Unfortunately, the service is really hit or miss. So, there's a star missing for that. I've had really great service once, okay service twice, and poor service twice.   The food though, we haven't had one disappointment. I've probably tasted at least half the menu. The tuna tartare is excellent, very unique and absolutely irresistible. The calamari with shrimp is some of the best I've found in the Phoenix area. The pizza (not something I typically rave about) is pretty amazing. I adore the mushroom pizza and order it almost every time just to have some to take home.  The cocktails are typically pretty good and fairly strong, though we've had a couple misses. Overall, Pomelo is a strong favorite and I love taking friends there.",

Teri was wonderful and was more than happy to cater to our high maintenance requests. While the drinks were a little on the pricey side, the pours were more than adequate to make up for it.   We started with two appetizers: Blistered Brussel Sprouts and the Garlic Focaccia. I am not a fan of balsamic so the Brussel sprouts were not my favorite, but my husband and friends thoroughly enjoyed them. If you are going to order the Garlic Focaccia you must order it with mozzarella and the pomodoro sauce! While a little on the salty side, this bread was hot, melty and overall had a good flavor.  For our entrees, we ordered the House Pizza which I was afraid would be too spicy for me, but it wasn't at all. It was delicious and a pizza I could eat again and again! The guys ordered the French Dip and Pork Chops. Both were content with their choices.   The service was great! Everyone from Teri to our server to the owner. Everyone spoke with us and made us feel welcome. We will be back!",

Great Mimosa specials and the food is fabulous. The menu has a very eclectic offering from pizza to chiliquillis (which i had and highly reccomend as they are made with a very hearty brisket meat), eggs benedict, and cinnimon rolls.",

    "text": "Very nice atmosphere with outdoor seating (although we sat inside on the very comfortable and soft couches).   We arrived on Sunday at around 11 and had only a very short wait. Our waiter, Alex, was super attentive. He took our drink order right away and was very patient while we chatted with out of town guests.  Once we ordered our food arrived quickly and the coffee was filled regularly (and it's very good coffee).  All our food was very tasty...  To start we had the spinach dip with tortilla chips. The dip was warm and creamy and the chips seemed freshly made.  The rest of our food...  1) French toast-large portion, fresh berries and the vanilla bean marscapone (?) is delicate and yummy.  2) The Yogi-a smaller portion of yogurt with berries and granola. The yogurt is delicious. I didn't try the blueberry muffin but it looks delicious.  3) Eggs Benedict- we ordered both the regular and the corned beef hash, both were fantastic.  4) Pepperoni pizza and mushroom pizza-pretty big pizzas, plenty for two people to share. Both had loads of toppings.  Again, the service was great and they were patient in allowing us to sit for quite awhile.  I would love to come again and sit outside, maybe for another brunch and have a bloody Mary (another person in our group ordered one so I was able to try it).  My only complaint was the persistent fly that continued to bother us but hey, if I were outside we'd have that same issue, right?  Overall a great place to sit, chat and have some great good with wonderful service.",

The portion size was pretty huge.  This time I had the carnivore pizza which was part of the $20 special which was a pizza and a bottle of wine, very good deal.  The pizza had this Tasso ham which is a must try!  It also had sausage and pepperoni.  Crust was very good, made with caputo flour which is supposed to be the best for pizza.  Also had the side salad with homemade Green Goddess dressing which was amazing.  It's made with yoghurt and basil.   Our server was very knowledgeable about the food, recommended the Green Goddess and also had an interesting conversation about cheese.     This place is attached to Luci's and it is a destination in itself.  After dinner you can walk the grounds and if you feel like ice cream go over to Luci's ice cream and candy shop.  It is very peaceful to sit outside on one of the benches enjoying ice cream.    This is a place you will want to come back to over and over.  Bring your friends!",

I chose the carnivore and loved it however the meat on top was a bit hard to bite through...guess having too much meat is a good problem to have. My buddy had the pepperoni pizza and with the ricotta on top was literally life changing. I will be back for some more very soon.

    "text": "Oddly located on a citrus farm in the middle of a community, Pomelo is one of the many ever-so-popular \"concept\" restaurants that keep popping up, with this particular location being one-third of a group of joints owned by Luci's Urban Concepts. Despite opening in mid-2016, Pomelo somehow flew under my radar until recently.  The grounds as a whole has sort of a cute, but manufactured feel to it. Pomelo itself, as many people have already stated, exhibits sleek decor within a somewhat sterile environment.  They offer both tables and booths. My girlfriend and I were seated at a corner booth, or as I refer to it, a \"mob booth,\" as it allows me to visually scan the entire restaurant to prepare for any oncoming attackers.  For starters, we ordered the garlic focaccia with melted mozzarella and a side of pomodoro sauce. Honestly, neither one of us were really impressed. The cheese had zero presence, almost as if it wasn't even there, despite clearly being able to see it. It was essentially nothing more than soggy bread, with the bland sauce doing very little to aid its appeal. On the plus, it was definitely a generously sized portion.  Additionally, we ordered their elote, or as us white folk call it, grilled corn on the cob. Aided by some not-so-spicy aioli and feta, we both really enjoyed its flavor to the point where it was clearly the stand-out dish of the evening. Although hitting your climax during foreplay is never a good sign, right?  We ordered a standard pepperoni pizza and after a brief debate about trying a burger, settled on the spicy fettuccine. I'll give them some credit for the fettuccine being something different, as the addition of chorizo makes it a little more interesting. Although in the end, it didn't really stand out as anything I'd order again.  As for the pizza? I'm overly-critical, but try to always approach all new places with an open-mind. But honestly, it just didn't do it for us. The toppings were okay, but nothing, whether it be the cheese, sauce, or pepperoni, really had any pop whatsoever. The crunchy crust had the charred look, but its flavor reminded me of eating something that has been harshly baked. I can't quite describe it - but it draws comparisons to the pizzas I'd get at Humble Pie or one of those corporate chains - which isn't really a compliment.   For desserts, they offered two options with lava cake or a salted caramel shortbread. Since we've yet to find lava cake that we've liked, we opted for the shortbread. Unfortunately, the caramel overpowered the whole thing, so instead of eating a cookie that's complimented by caramel, you're eating a goopy load of ultra-thick caramel that is complimented by cookie crumbs. Neither one of us finished it, which rarely happens with desserts.  Honestly, I don't want to be too harsh on this place. I mean, nothing was particularly wrong with the food. I believe everything was served the way its intended to be. It just simply wasn't for us.  The server was pleasant, although things seemed somewhat slow. With starters, entrees, and a dessert, we were there for over two hours. Overall, the place does have some potential and will most likely garner a set of regular diners over time.  Although we didn't really like it, since it's a new business, I still think people should try it for themselves and draw their own conclusions.",

    "text": "We frequent this restaurant, especially for the pizza & wine special on Mon. & Tues. I sat at the bar on Wed. w/ a friend for dinner & asked what veggies were being served w/ the salmon. Ordered & didn't get one vegetable the bartender mentioned. Plus, they added meat (chorizo) to the veggies. Huh? Who does that??? Told the bartender it wasn't what I ordered and rather that comping the meal they chose to offer a resolution $3 less than the total meal so they could make a $3 profit. Now, I agreed to this because I did eat 1/2 of the salmon, but, really? Why not just comp the meal? It left a bad taste in my mouth, literally. Plus, the bartender serving us didn't return after my complaint & sent someone else out to finish billing us. In an area with so many restaurants, I don't see how offering such poor service will keep them alive. There was no one in the dining room at 7:30 pm on a Wed. either. Hmmmm.",

It took a while to get our drinks and the waitress came to take our food order before the drinks even came out. It took an hour to get our food and then the food order was wrong. They said the reason the food took so long was because they had an issue thawing out the fish. Lovely! Then they brought out a pizza instead of the ribs (pizza was good) but the wrong order. Then it took about 20 minutes for them to split the bill down the middle on 2 cards. They blamed everything on glitches so maybe I'd try again in a few months when the glitches are worked out but you only have 1 chance to make a first impression. So disappointing:-(",

Not much for choices on the menu and for the type of food, kinda pricey. I had the mussels and the sauce was great but the mussels tasted like sewage, definitely old. My husband had their pepperoni pizza which we both loved. Then we ordered their fig and pear cobbler which was amazing. We sat inside and still flies were everywhere around our food so it felt like sitting outside trying to shoo all the flies away while eating. We will have to come back when they have worked out all of their issues. Staff was very friendly but General Manager should learn how to manage and be part of his staff team.",

The hostess greeted me right away but on her way to seat me got distracted by another staff member and I was just expected to wait for them to finish their conversation. The server came out right away but was very clearly uncomfortable. The service was so robotic the whole way through. I ordered a salad and the mussels. That was a mistake- when the food finally came out, the taste was rancid. Clearly not fresh. I finished my salad, asked for the check and left. The server didn't even ask about the full plate of mussels. I'll spend my money elsewhere moving forward. Not a good first impression.",

Ordered beet salad (excellent) and pesto garden pizza (more kale than other veggies, not a lot of flavor, good crust- but I'll stick to my Papa Murphy's veggie pizza!) and my husband had steak and mashed potatoes.  With as many excellent restaurant choices there are in the Valley, I don't think I'll need to repeat this one",

We couldn't get our checks and then no one came to take our money.  Since I didn't need change, I finally left mine on the table and left.

Plus, their fries are delicious, perfectly prepared, crisp and favorable. Their salads are also beautifully prepared, the Caesar with salmon was perfection. The salmon was moist and flavorful, perfectly cooked. They offer a full bar with an extensive wine list, both by the bottle or the glass. The service was first rate, attentive, but, not overwhelming.

We had a great conversation and he offered me a gift card to return.  Last night we met up with another couple from the Italian Club for happy hour and all of us had a great time.  The food (bbq ribs, brussels sprouts and calamari) were spot on and we enjoyed our cocktails as well.  Mike the bartender was really great and took good care of us.  Ken, 1 of the owners stopped by our table to check in to see how we were doing.  He even brought of samples of the Pomelo vodka that's made right here in AZ.

    "text": "This place is so so cute, and I almost wish we could have saved our first time here for brunch, but alas.  We ordered the $23 meat and cheese board and it was pepperoni thrown in a plate, like 4 rolled up salami slices, a couple of toasted bread slices, some gross smoked Gouda, literally 3 pickle slices, and 3 slices of an orange.  I could have bought all of those ingredients in whole for about $11.  And why orange slices???  I have never had a charcuterie board with citrus.  It was so awful and overpriced...oh I wish I would have taken a picture of the sad spread.  The pepperoni pizza was soggy and the cheese tasted off.  The spicy linguine was pretty good, and the prime rib was delish(it was a special of the night).  Overall not worth the price tag, but cute place to sit outside and have a cocktail.",

My family got the chiliqueles and did like that. My hubby got a burger and the bottom bun was so soggy he had to eat the burger with a fork. We ordered a pizza to go and once again, it sat on the counter in the kitchen for over 15 minutes before it was boxed and brought to us. We watched it as it sat and watched them box the cold pizza. We asked several times if that was ours as we saw it sit and get cold and they said no each time but when ours came out it was cold. Service is still serious lacking! It is weird but everyone in there seems high. We have thought that both times and other people have commented on it as well. Won't be returning again.",

And when we arrived there everything was just so clean and pretty and the staff where just amazing and so sweet ! We order the Napolitan Pizza and I have to say it's by far the best pizza I had tested, our order didn't take long we waited for not long at all ,  the kids loved it we all enjoyed the entire day . We had so many spills with my kids and the staff where more than happy to help us out. If can give them more stars i would ! I recommend this place 100%",

The menu has many things to choose from but I couldn't really understand what type of region the food was since I saw everything from pizzas to My new favorite salmon dish. That's probably the only thing that I can say negative or it could be positive for others because I normally know if I'm going to an Italian restaurant or Mexican cuisine, here they had a blend of everything. My boyfriend tried the pork chop that was cooked perfectly and I had the wild salmon which had this arugula salad topped of on that was very citrusy. The server we had was very attentive and was always checking on us. The place is gorgeous and We will for certainly be coming back again. Thanks for the great experience guys!!",

The spinach artichoke dip also come with an amazing, spicy salsa. The foccaccia comes with a full clove of roasted garlic. My brother and I both got the pepperoni pizza, and it was phenomenal. The Shrieners pepperoni was delicious, and the blend of the ricotta and fresh basil was a perfect compliment. My wife got the burger, which was perfectly seasoned. It has a smokey sweetness to it and the fries were well seasoned as well. Also the bar mixes a nice strong drink. I had a double gin and tonic, my brother had a Belvidere martini, dirty, and my wife has the Belissimo, one of their signature drinks, also very tasty.",

Clearly, teamwork is important here and that's what makes the service so good. I was also really impressed by the food--the spinach dip might be the best I've ever had. We also ordered the mushroom pizza and spicy fettuccine which were both flavorful and delicious. The grounds are beautiful, and I like the intimate size of the dining room.

Dry chicken, soggy pizza and undercooked  rice that almost made me break a tooth. The hostess was super friendly though and made us laugh, and the wait staff all seemed pretty happy. You could tell the difference between the wait staff/management/owner, which kind of says alot. The wait staff was chipper, smiling and eager to please. Management was up their ass, stressed out and running around. And the owners were...nowhere to be seen?....kinda strange. Except there was a lady, in a gray dress, that looked like she was miserable  walking around. So, all in all the place is new and has some shit to fix. I hope when I come back  in a few months the food will have gotten better and the lady in the gray dress will have gotten the stick out of her butt.",

The hummus was not over salted etc. Spinach & artichoke was yummy too! Beet salad? Where is the beet? Lol .... don't waist your money I had the Pork chop mine was cooked to perfection nice & moist. Vegetables were fine nothing special. Garlic mashed potatoes felt over milked , like it cane from a box not a real potato? I like thicker mashed potatoes with chucks of roasted garlic.

First of all, I don't know Alex and secondly this exemplifies the type of service this place has. I can't tell if a manager claims he's the owner. All I know is someone says he's the owner and then proceeds to act like a jerk. I post this so they can see the type of place they run and maybe take the time to investigate and improve. Instead they get defensive and then threatening. I'll admit I probably didn't meet the owner tonight(I just don't know)  but if this is the type of establishment he or she is running, I can't imagine it would be any different if I did meet him/her.

Love the outdoor area of the restaurant with the grassy area- lots of kiddos were running around enjoying themselves. The awnings hanging are the perfect touch. The restaurant itself features a patio area with umbrellas covering shade. In quintessential PHX fashion it was too hot to sit outside today so we headed in. Although late for our resi the server was very accommodating and seated us in a room off the bar in a \"living room\" styled area with a large fireplace and hanging candelabra. The dark green walls and leather booths give it a homey effect- it works.   I really liked the menu & although I'm on a super annoying cleanse & was unable to try Everything, they were really accommodating to my dietary needs and gave me my order exactly as requested.   Our server was attentive & stopped in enough for beverage refills. It was a business meeting so her attentiveness was not excessive or insufficient- Goldilocks rule applies: just right.   Our booth was a bit on the small size. I'd say it was doable for two women, one petite but would be cramped to be both carving at a steak next to one another. They're more of a 2 party booth set up.   My salad was fantastic and as stated, made to my request. The chopped salad looked delicious as did the garlic focaccia bread, which is a massive serving I might add. Great spot that I hope to return too! And also a small but very well appointed bar within.",

    "text": "We sat at an outdoor table near the fire pit during the winter. It was cold, but the fire pit helped. They were able to get the heat lamp working for about half the time we dined there. Everything we ordered including pizzas, brussel sprouts, burger, wings, etc. were good. My friend had a food allergy and let the server know. Sure enough, the kitchen and server did not pay attention and did not omit the item. So she and everything had to wait for her food. It would have been nice if they had offered a complimentary app or drink while she waited.  Without the firepit, it would have been too cold on a winter night.  The inside of the restaurant looked cute. Interestingly, it only seemed like older couples were sitting inside. Afterwards, we got some pastries from Luci's across the fake grass area for dessert.",

The wines were disappointing and the liquor second rate. However, the staff were nice and gave generous pours. We started out with some yummy apps, which included some sinful artichoke dip. Entrees were three pastas, each of which was very good. Desserts were petite but tasty bites. A nice night, but I'd like to order from the menu to get a better feel for this place.",

We were seated outside on the street side of the restaurant where there is a nice fire structure. For some reason, the fire was turned off midway through our meal even though we requested it to be turned back on, as it added ambiance and distraction from the street. Also, once the sun sets, that particular area is not well lit and is quite dark. We ordered drinks, but the wine didn't come out until halfway through the appetizers and the waters took awhile and then not refilled. At the end of our main course, we were given the bill even though we were not offered dessert, which we would have really enjoyed.",

Everyone shared the Brussel Sprouts that were good-but a bit hard & over charred for all of us.

    "text": "I really wanted to fall in love with Pomelo. The charming setting with an extensive, tree-shaded patio is so appealing. The inside is attractive with just enough coziness from the leaf-green leather corner booths and low-key, dreamy landscape paintings to balance the huge windows looking out to said patio. Leather acoustic panels on the ceiling dampen the sound to achieve the right level between sepulchral and manic din. Wanted to love it.  Husband and I arrived on a whim, without reservations, around 6:30 on a Saturday, our wedding anniversary for which we'd made zero plans. Nothing available outside, of course, but a manager overheard us about to leave and offered one of the swanky corner booths that had just opened. These are for just two people, and you sit facing the room. So romantic.  Our charming server took a photo or two of us on my phone, then headed off to put in our appetizer order. And then, we waited.   Okay, a Saturday night, the place was about 3/4 full, a wait is to be expected. But just when I got to the \"where the HELL is this appetizer?\" point, a server emerged from the kitchen with our entrees and moments later, a woman who appeared to be a manager popped up with the appetizer. Hmmn. She was embarrassed and said so, but no, I didn't want the entrees to go back into the kitchen and sit (I presume). So everything on the table at once. Whatev.  My husband adored his Carnivore pizza. The appetizer, a mix of breaded small shrimp and calimari was just okay. I, however, was seriously underwhelmed with my short ribs. Tough, dry, and bland. The mashed and veggies likewise bland. I'd been hoping for big flavors. Nope.  I finally flagged the manager and explained, and he said they'd remake the dish. Minutes later he re-appeared and apologized, but the entire batch of short ribs was undercooked. He took them off the menu.  So. What instead? I went with salmon with a creamy arugula sauce over roasted fingerling and sweet potatoes. Okay, but the salmon was overdone. I can do better at home (my standard for judging a restaurant).  I'd ordered a glass of sangiovese; it arrived at least 10 too warm. We tried for dessert, decaf for me, and a refill of water glasses. The chocolate cake was meh, with that weird, spongy texture that tells me the baker had never had a decent birthday cake. Not Layercakus Americanus. The coffee was lukewarm, and turned cold once milk was added. I never got the sugar I'd asked for twice, and we never did get water refilled.   Oy. The staff's attitude was lovely, but that's not going to fix mediocre food and serving missteps. The latter were not entirely the fault of our inexperienced server (she'd just finished her training), but keeping water glasses filled is pretty basic, even when the place gets busy. Someone isn't paying attention in the kitchen: there's no way those tough, tasteless short ribs (no pan sauce or gravy, either!) should ever have been plated. And when it comes to seasoning, who's their audience? Someone who thinks brandishing a peppermill is the height of daring?  I suspect that lunch at Luci's in the Orchard, their more casual option geared to salads and sandwiches, would be a more successful meal. But this dinner was just ... meh.",

From the start, staff was rude and unaccommodating. It took at least 30 min for us to get service for a party of 12. Also to note at this time the restaurant was not busy inside. Water was brought to one end of the table and left for us to distribute amongst ourselves. Also one of the glasses had lip stick marks on it. The server  was not friendly or accommodating - appeared very inexperienced.  I would not recommend this place for any event or large party. They clearly don't know what they are doing and given the type of space it was built to accommodate such.",

Took a stroll around the place to check it all out, Luci's, the ice cream shop and the outside area before settling in at Pomelo.  First person we were greeted by, a server setting up the patio tables, she was very friendly and welcoming. We sat at the bar, the place was not too crowded, which was surprising for a Friday night...but it was only 5:00 when we arrived. Bartender was quick to take our order, and deliver....again very friendly and anxious to take care of us.  Drinks were delicious - I had a bellisimo and my husband had a sculpin beer (guess you can't really do anything to that but pour, so let's say drink was delicious).  Ordered a couple of appetizers (happy hour $$)  the wood roasted olives -yum! and the calamari both were very good....we followed up by ordering dinners - I had the beet salad and it was HUGE, enough for two, my husband had a customized pizza which he said was fantastic.....so great place, great service will definitely be back!!!  UPDATE: We visited this place last night, and it's amazing how ONE person can change your opinion of a place.  We had a great bartender, she quickly took care of us with water and taking our drink order (sat at the bar).  As we sat there and observed the happenings....one of the bartenders (not ours) got into a somewhat heated discussion with another customer across the bar (something about the bill, to the point that the bartender, very sternly said \"I've taken one wine off, OK?\")strike one, then the same bartender was upset about there being no \"F'n Lemons\" loud enough so that I could hear him, (strike two), really that upsets you so much that you demonstrate that in front of customers? then he said something to our bartender about how long she'd been there...next thing we know she's clocking out.  By this time we had already asked for our bill which she promptly brought, but left prior to our credit card being processed...so we waited, and waited, and waited....  I tried to get the attention of \"mr friendly bartender\"..he was waiting on another customer and said \"yeah, hold on\"...OK...I've been waiting longer to close out my tab then I did to get my drink (strike THREE).  YOU know if you don't like to deal with customers, or are having a shitty day...STAY HOME don't make the rest of us suffer your pissy poor attitude.  Next visit, if Mr Sunshine is still bartending, we're going to turn right around and leave...",

My daughter then ordered a basic Caesar salad which was average for $17. The best part was the manager stared at our table to the point of uncomfortableness & never came over to speak with us.

    "text": "Met a friend after work for a bite. Arrived at 5pm on a Friday and at first were told by the front staff that without a reservation, no tables. Two, at 5 pm? Miraculously they did find us a table, which was great since we did not want to sit in the bar.  Ordered water and a drink, which were delivered promptly enough. We then ordered the Brussel Sprout appetizer, which sounds great on the menu....but is sorely lacking in the execution. Basically, the Brussels sprouts were almost raw...roasting them does not deal with the chewiness if they are not steamed in some way. Finishing them in a little beef broth would have been perfect...but as I realized by the end of the meal, this is the problem with Pomela. They almost get it right....but not quite. The \"bacon\" in the recipe were bits so small they were almost sub atomic particles; particles that could not be chewed and stuck painfully in my teethwhile also imparting little flavor. The biggest problem with the meals were scant sauces lacking flavor and seriously undercooked vegetables.  I understand al dente, but I don't like raw. Hey chefs, it's okay if the veggies have a little \"give\". All the veggies in both meals were just over raw, and they could use a lesson on salt, pepper and spices. I had braised short ribs which should have melted in my mouth and been oozing the brazing juices; they were dry and had no juice, and the gravy they did serve was sparse. As for my partner's meal, the prime rib looked good and was properly prepared to order, but again; meh. Most of it went in to go bags where I will doctor mine at home to make it more palatable with some garlic, olive oil and broth.   All in all, the service was fine and the food just okay. I would go possibly for happy hour as my not oft ordered French 75 was very good. The atmosphere was a bit austere to my taste, and as several reveiwers mentioned, on the  manufactured side. As for the food, lots of choices in Phoenix...I will try others before I return, if at all.",

    "text": "I was very disappointed in this restaurant. Not only was the food a disappointment but the service as well. It tasted as if the food was pre-made elsewhere and just heated up and served to our table. The pork chops were overcooked and dry and the vegetables did not seem fresh. The ingredients used on the pizza did not seem fresh and the cheese tasted as if it were a low-quality cheese. Definitely not worth the prices that they charge.",

After being sat reminded the server we needed a high chair. Another 10 mins went by. No server. No high chair. Several servers stared at our table, despite making eye contact not one came to our table. I cannot speak to the food since we left before ordering. I should have trusted similar reviews.",

Initially when we walked in we were told due to reservations - we were a walk in - that we would have a 20-25 minute wait. Obviously, with a three year old, that isn't going to fly. The hostess (stephanie) immediately recognized this and worked her magic to ensure we got a seat. I ordered the Wednesday taco and margarita special for $10 - hands down the best special in town! The fish tacos are the best I have had in Phoenix. My son got the chicken and fries which he loved. The owner Jerry introduced himself and made sure we were comfortable - going as far as bringing paper for my son to draw on. I would absolutely recommend this place to anyone.",

The grounds are simply beautiful!! Just by walking in, I knew we were going to have a great dining experience. When it was time to report to the hostess stand to check in, we were greeted by the hostess, who swung the door open as if she were anxiously awaiting our arrival. Once we were seated, our waitress took great care of us throughout the meal, even bringing a complimentary slice of cheesecake since Mum and I were there to celebrate my birthday (albeit a week after the fact). We shared the hummus appetizer, the chopped salad, and the roasted salmon entree.  All of our food was outstanding! Perfectly prepared, well presented, and absolutely delicious. The ambiance made the whole experience that much more special. We will definitely return!",

Each time I come in and get told that they can only seat me inside because the outside is full. The second to last time for my friends birthday with a party of 8, we made reservations 3 weeks ahead and asked to be seated outside. A large party had just left and they told us they can't seat us outside because they need to separate to the tables to give them to others that came in without a reservation. The following time I came for a wedding anniversary and they said it will be an hour wait to be seated outside even though we had reservations ahead of time. I asked why she cant seat us at the table that was open, she said it is a 4 top and can't seat 2 people only. Literally 20 minutes later, she seats a couple (party of 2) at that same table that were just a walk in. I was so upset that this kept happening that I finally brought it to the managers attention, who could not care less how we felt. He said he had an issue with the girl upfront, and next time to just say the manager said its fine to sit on the patio. Literally wouldn't even look me in the eye. There won't be a next time, thats for sure!!!",

Easy parking and excellent service. Lunch menu was small but enough options for all. No cappucino coffee. Most of the people had sandwichs, fish tacos and I had the Ahi Salad.  Apps included roasted brussel sprouts and a  breaded calamari dish. The sprouts were good. I did not eat the calamari. Ahi salad was good but a bit bland for my palate.  Probably can kick it up with a ginger miso dressing.  The roasted beet salad looked good on the menu.   Overall a pleasant dining experience. Outside seating looked very inviting in cooler days. Great addition to this north Phoenix neighborhood. Worth another trip to try the roasted beet salad.",

The servers are super friendly and attentive, and give you that fancy restaurant feel :)  The first time we came with my fiance's family, I had the Carnivore pizza which I thought was really good, and he had the Amazing French Dip (which he didn't find amazing to be honest lol, but his brother really liked it). Other than that people had the burger and different pastas, and everyone seemed to like their food. We also had really good appetizers - I would recommend the Blistered Brussel Sprouts and Garlic Focaccia!   This past weekend, to try something different, we started with the Calamari & Shrimp Fritti, which was delicious. We always love calamari, and the Pomodoro sauce was really good (normally I don't care for the sauce you get with calamari, but this isn't just cocktail sauce or whatever, it's spicy and has good flavor). For dinner, I got the Roasted Chicken and my fiance got the Pasta Bolognese. We both really liked them, and you get a lot of sirloin in the pasta! You get a big serving of chicken, too, and the mashed potatoes are delicious. :)   So far we've only been here in the fall and winter, but I can't wait to come again in the spring to sit on the patio. The fireplace outside is so pretty!",

Came here with a group of six and appreciated their willingness to get us in with a days notice.  Really enjoyed a host of appetizers from hummus to the cheeseboard to Mexican corn and brussels sprouts.All prepared really well and very satisfying.  For an entree, had the pork chop which was big but on the dry side although the sauce was really delicious. After all the appetizers, only needed to eat half which was good because I wasn't really enjoying what turned out to be a pretty tough dry slab of meat.  Will definitely come back here and order a bit more carefully - heard from across the table the salmon was good and service was very strong.",

The restaurant is savory and I feel the options to be pretty exceptional . Lots of vegetarian options to carnivore options.  Thursday is burger and brew for $16.  Huge burger, 16 oz beer and fries.  Monday/Tuesday is pizza and bottle wine for $25,  Awesome prices and you'll leave happy.  Spinach dip was hearty, Brussel sprouts (omg) good, grass fed burger is huge.  Soup of the day was specifically made vegetarian base and done honestly superb in flavor.  The restaurant is in a residential type area. The history of the property is cool. I remember what it was beforehand.   There is a meeting room for 16 guests up stairs, a big meeting/party room in the basement, a wedding venue or a great company party venue outside.  Everything is locally resourced and they have their own Pomelo vodka which after taste is like a tangerine crossover. Best vodka shot for those who need a quick release or wake up.   I absolutely recommend this place. The owners deserve our business because they are doing everything they can to build a diverse welcoming and community hip place for customers to enjoy.  Its family oriented with a kiddie water area while parents enjoy a coffee or treat.  They have splurge which is their award winning ice cream shop. Then they have pomelo for people like me who enjoy a good craft brew or drink with a very hearty and flavorful appetizer.   Thanks Ken, Luci, Jerry and Michelle for going above and beyond just because you genuinely care about those who choose to frequent your business.",

It was pretty empty at that hour and we sat in the patio, however the lawn was preparing for a political event, so there was lots of people watching.  We ordered a bottle of red wine and a mushroom pizza. Good wood-fire burning and decent wine- was definitely worth it for the price.",

When we entered the restaurant at 8 the host told us the few areas we could sit because they were closing soon (they close at 9). He took us to our table and you could tell he was upset that we wanted to stay and eat. It 20 minutes for someone to even get our drink order. When it came to our food order the waiter said you better get in your order the kitchen closes in 10 min. Which means it closes at 830....   The food was good as always but the service just always ruins the night.   I honestly don't get why the staff here is so rude. The food and ambiance is so nice but it is ruined by the horrible service. Something needs to change.",

    "text": "So, we have given this place many, many tries. We have come for brunch, lunch, and dinners. I really wanted to have a good experience because it's so stinkin cute and I love the ambiance.   Sadly, tonight, we left before we even got water. The service, once again, was dreadful. The hostess was either new, overwhelmed,  or just slow. We sat in the dining room with only 3 other tables occupied, had probably 4 different walk-bys by wait staff, and no one stopped to say they would be right with us, sorry for the wait...nothing. We had already experienced poor service several times in the past so we knew this was looming like it would be the same so we finally left.   As far as the food....the weekend brunch, in my opinion,  is meh. No flavor at all.  I tried several things on several occasions and they just weren't that good...some I even sent back for the blandness. Chilaquiles...bland...sent it back. Salad...no flavor. Seared Ahi salad...nope...bland. Chopped salad...again...bland. Even the mimosas aren't good...tastes like they use frozen orange juice concentrate. The dinner menu looked promising but didn't stay long enough to try.   I will give credit to the cinnamon roll...it's amazing!  Again, if you have hours to dawdle, don't mind having to track down your server, don't mind kinda meh food, don't mind the bartender being your server and not being very available, but you love great ambiance I'd say go for it.   Really...we gave this place many tries because I really want to love it...but we have just had way too many disappointing service experiences and so so food to ever try again.",

I got the gluten free pizza (pepperoni [ricotta on pepperoni pizza, why is no one else making this a thing?!?! so fantastic]).  I've been gluten free for nearly two years due to a health issue and this is the best dang pizza I've had since going GF.  They make their own crust, using a sourdough starter.  It is not your typical ultra-thin gluten free crust.  It is a little thick (my favorite type) and has a nice crispy crust & edge.  It even reheated fairly well with micro & toaster oven (to recrisp).  This will be my new favorite place for pizza.  My husband got the burger, with all the glutenous rich brioche bun, and said it was delicious.  The fries (also GF) were a bit soggy.  Hoping this was a one-off incident.  I'd love to try the burger sans bun, but I'll be hard pressed to get it when I loved the pizza as much as I did.",

It's November and no where has better November weather than Arizona, so why not open all the sliding doors to the patio open? If you come and the doors are open, SIT OUTSIDE. I can't tell you how many flies we were swatting away! The entire meal from when we got our drinks until the end when we were finishing our cinnamon roll!  Somehow no one outside was having this issue, just us sitting in the corner inside.  Don't get me wrong, the food was delicious! And the service was kind.

Either it didn't get enough time to heat it up or it sat away from the heat lamp before it was served - but it was tepid at best. My entree (halibut, it was terrible, more on that in a minute) was also served tepid, or barely room temperature. The halibut tasted like it had been in the freezer for awhile and then over cooked to compensate . The hostess came by and asked how our food was - when I mentioned that the halibut was not good, she did immediately fix it and replaced it with salmon. But I sat for 10 minutes with no food while they fixed it.   Overall not horrible. But Not Good, especially considering the price point.",

My husband had the Ahi tuna salad which had quinoa and avocado. It was very flavorful and would be very highly recommended. Prices range from minimum $12 to about $25. The wine choices are plentiful.

Since I am from out of town, I made most of the arrangement long distance, and Linda Schnitzer, my planner, could not have done a better job, from the logistics of the dinner, to the food and drink recommendations and coordinating the service at the night of the dinner. Nothing fazed her helpful, cheery demeanor. She was sensitive to price all through the planning and we got lots of value for our $. For example the entrees were fettuccine/pasta dishes, generous buffet servings, and the guests raved about the food. The service timing and attention were excellent. Every detail was addressed both before and during the dinner by Linda and Amanda and the servers. I will be going back whenever I want to treat myself to a charming, garden relaxed setting that is an isle of tranquility in north central Phoenix. Thank you, Pomelo!!!",

In addition, one of the glasses had a lipstick mark still on the rim of the glass.   Our party ordered several different dishes. I had ordered two types of pizza. The crust was burnt with both.

First, let me say the atmosphere is incredible!  Lots of space both indoor and outdoor, as well as some nice private dining rooms.  The colors are way cool and add a nice warm ambience.  There is a great bar and an adjoining living room with a working fireplace to wait for your table.  We sat in a booth and our waitress Sherrie was very accommodating to us the entire evening.    We started with the spinach & artichoke appetizer with chips and it was delicious and plenty for sharing.  We had cocktails and ordered our entree's.  I had the pork ribs that come with French fries and home made cole slaw.  Let me say the portion was WAY too much and I had plenty left over to take home with me.  The others in my party enjoyed their entree's too (one had a pizza, one had the beet salad with chicken and one had the NY Strip).  We shared the peach shortbread dessert and that was the only somewhat disappointing thing of the evening.  The \"shortbread\" was more like a store bought angel food cake than True shortbread and the peaches were not fresh peaches, but it was still a tasty ending to a delicious meal.    This is going to be a very crowded place once the weather cools down so go now and love it while you can!",

The horseradish had the best bit of bite to it and my sinuses were cleared up in the best way possible :)  The garlic potatoes were a bit creamier than I like, but they were still flavourful. We had the small room reserved for a group of 10. Split checks were not an issue, in fact they were offered. Since we were celebrating a graduation, the chef gave us complimentary dessert.... and not the typical one dessert that everyone splits. I'm talking three large desserts so everyone had a generous portion. I think it was a bread pudding with ice cream/gelato on top. I said I'd have just one bite but ended up eating a lot more than one - it was so good!  They also have $5 cocktails all of July, so take a Lyft :)",

We had 3 bruschetta and while the bread had grill marks to appear like it was heated, it was room temperature and soft.  I had the short ribs which were tough and flavorless.  They were served over an extremely large portion of polenta as well as some potatoes and vegetables.  I thought it was weird they served polenta and potatoes on the same dish.  My wife had the spicy fettuccini that per the menu includes asparagus but for whatever reason didn't include it.  We were short on time so we didn't send anything back.  I'd be open to going back but I'd have to try something different.",

It fits really well into the neighborhood, and is great for people of all ages. Pomelo itself sits on the south side of the property, inhabiting an original home with an addition. The atmosphere is cozy, with great architectural detailing and attention to detail. Our table shared the spinach dip and wings for appetizers. The spinach was delicious, although it would've been a bit better if it stayed warm longer. The wings were some of the best we've had, a nice combinations of spicy with a little heat and great flavor. For dinner I had the pepperoni pizza. Loved the added ricotta on top, and the ingredients all tasted really good. Everyone else at my table seemed to really enjoy their meal. We will definitely be frequenting Pomelo and look forward to the other concepts opening to fill out this beautifully done space.",

    "text": "Tried for a second time after a dismal first visit.  To be fair, the first visit was when the restaurant was new.  This time, I found the ambience comfortable, staff friendly.  We ordered the spinach dip for an appetizer, my husband and I ordered a salad \"to start\" (key words) and a pizza.  Our companions each ordered the halibut with a side of vegetables and a salad \"to start\".  Our waitress clarified that they each wanted the halibut dish.  Well, first we received the side of vegetables (about 15 minutes before the appetizer)??  Then we received the spinach dip.  After a few minutes, all of the food came to the table at once.  We indicated that we had wanted to start with our salads, not the veggies. They took the pizza, two halibuts and veggies (veggies by now had been sitting on the table for 30 minutes - back to the kitchen, presumably to put under the heat lamp).  The salad was fresh and tasty.  However, when the food came back, as expected, the halibut was completely dried out.  Our companion did state that it had a nice flavor.  Please note, however, when the food came back, there was only one halibut.  We contacted the waitress who seem befuddled as to what had happened to our other halibut.  Short story, they had to remake the halibut and our companion ended up eating by himself.  Too bad they haven't gotten their kitchen timing down.  Our pizza was soggy and greasy as it too had sat under the heat lamp.  I will say, that I have found lately, that it is imperative as a diner than you indicate your preference to eat your starter before the actual meal.  Many restaurants these days tend to bring all of the food out at once, which I do not enjoy as it makes you feel rushed.  Given the flavor, I'm hoping Pomelo can somehow get on track.",

The manager took responsibility for what happened that day but promised me that it was completely contrary to the goal of Pomelo for any customer to walk away dissatisfied. He also said that changes had been made to address issues at the restaurant that had resulted in my awful experience. I was offered a gift card if I would return to give them another chance.   How can you turn that down? Of course I would return! My schedule is crazy, so it took me awhile but tonight we finally made it back. We were immediately seated on the patio to enjoy what could be one of the last tolerable evenings before the summer heat sets in. We were immediately greeted by our server, Taron who was great the whole night. We had pizza and a French Dip (yaaay-a good French Dip!) with drinks. Everything was fantastic and the atmosphere and service were as well.   Big props to Pomelo's staff for not being afraid to apologize and make big changes. We will be back.",

The reservation was messed up, the person at the front rolled her eyes on me, (as someone who spent 15 years in customer service, I'd say: this is not your place to do that...)  The food:  this time everything was bland.  Salads were dry, my friend's steak overcooked, potatoes had no salt, no flavor.  Nothing was addressed even though she told the server about it.  (I need to add, that some servers there give, a hands down, 5 star service) I still may be back for pizza, since I like the Orchard and it's near me, but I wish I was more excited about eating there.",

The customer service was impeccable, the kindness and generosity of the owners and the entire staff was like no other! The food was the BEST FOOD I've had in a very long time and everything was simply perfect. This is coming from someone who is a perfectionist and it takes a lot to impress me! everything from the flowers on the tables, to the table setups, to the lighting, to the ambience, to the tiny title details that pomelo included was beyond measure. We had a feeling it would be a beautiful evening, but we had no idea it would rock our world like it did! I could go on and on, but if you're thinking about doing a special event anywhere, this place is it. They go above and beyond (I checked out many places) and they set the bar! I HIGHLY recommend Pomelo - you will NOT be disappointed!!!!! :)",

    "text": "7/3/18 Update: They've ironed out the kinks and this is a decent neighborhood restaurant. Brunch is delicious, but can't compete with all the \"bottomless mimosas\" and \"make your own Bloodys\" in the area. Had dinner at the bar recently and thought TJ was a creative and friendly bartender, but has the attention span of an ant. He forgot everything and we had to ask for things numerous times.   After driving by this new project, The Orchard, for a year, I finally checked it out with a friend. It was the second weekend since its opening and the new-ness was evident. The grounds are gorgeous: Lots of outdoor seating, grassy area, misters, and a fun family ambiance. Pomelo, one restaurant in the Orchard development, was packed at 5:30 pm on a Friday. It has a dining room, bar, \"blue\" room, patios, and a private cellar that I didn't see. We sat in the blue room which is sort of a bar area where all servers take care of all customers. There are couches, tables, and a cool giant brass light fixture. Unfortunately the service was really slow and we had to ask for service 2-3 times. They were out of a wine we wanted, an appetizer, and an entree. It was 6 PM on Friday, so chalk that up to poor planning/ordering. They served the wrong wine once, but then didn't charge us for the mistake. We had the meat & cheese tray which was delicious. A Caesar salad and the halibut for dinner were both tasty. I thought the food menu was a little small-I would like to see more items. We weren't offered a drink menu, so I don't know if that exists. But the wine list was good with adequate variety and price range. Pomelo has great potential, they just need to better train their waitstaff and do a better job with inventory. I hope to raise my rating once Pomelo irons out the kinks.",

Everything had this deliciousness, but it was like a tease because you want more! Our table was a bit tight for us. We ended up spilling our wine because it was kinda tight. All good though- we will most definitely be back! Thank you!",

When the dish came out, the eggs were overcooked (cooked hard... not a good look), BUT Pomelo saved itself by quickly taking the dish back and remaking the eggs. The dish was tasty... maybe not the best bene around, but not bad. I also tried the breakfast pizza, which was alright, but not something I would order.

This weekend I was entertaining out of town guests and thought I'd give Pomelo another try and made a reservation for us to sit on the patio.   When we arrived we were seated in the back of the inside, despite there being open tables on the patio. I spoke up, but was told that they couldn't accommodate us because the employee who took my reservation neglected to write down my one simple request.   The waitress promised to \"make it up to us\" but never did. Simple good service or an app on the house would have done the trick. Instead, she brought our drinks (mostly non alcoholic) after our food arrived, and our food came our at all different times. Also our drinks were not refilled one time.   Overall I was embarrassed we brought our guests here to the \"nice patio with amazing Phoenix weather.\" The food was just so so and overpriced in my opinion. There are so many great spots in central Phoenix that you can skip this place- or if you're really curious about the quaint outdoor space, just get a $6 coffee from Lucis and call it a day.",

We brought the matter to the attention of our server who brought us everything on a side plate except the seeds and edamame (they were out) and we proceeded to build our salad to match the menu description.  also they only brought size of missing ingredients for one salad even though both salads were missing half the ingredients. I added AHI to my salad and while generous in portion, it was bland.  The color seemed off (see picture).  If you look at the salad section on the website menu, there is a picture of the Ahi and that is no where near what today's ahi resembled.  When it was time for the check, the server offered to buy us dessert or a beer, but we declined.  The chopped salad with the AHI add-on was $23.  For that price, it better be perfect.  It was far from it.  Our lunch (2 salads--one with protein add-on, side of fries, two draft beers) came to $65 after tax and tip.  The experience did not match our expectations for that price point.",

We had an issue with an allergy due to the menu, but it has completely been addressed by management to ensure no one could have an issue.

Then, once seated (wedged in between two tables - very uncomfortable - as there were plenty of other tables and booths where we would not have crowded other patrons)  it took about five minutes for a server to take our order (and thank God, so we thought, for putting our entire order in at once in the hopes it would expedite the lasaiz faire service we had experienced so far). I ordered a beer and my partner ordered an iced tea. 15 minutes later, our water glasses were empty and no beer or iced tea. Good thing we weren't really thirsty.   Remember those two tables around us? They were attended to no less than three times while we sat there, no water and twiddling our thumbs. That was it. We got up and walked out. Such a disappointment. We will NEVER go back there as there are plenty of other quality restaurants in the area that treat their customers much better.",

The service from hostess station to the table staff was prompt and friendly and our water glasses and drinks were always filled, and it truly seemed like this level of service was going on at every table around us. They were steady but not packed and it was lunch time.   I had the patty melt, which was huge, super tasty, and cooked exactly like I had requested. My boyfriend had his usual... a cheese pizza.  He was really happy with it and said the crust was really really good.  I took half the patty melt home and actually ate it, which is not typical with leftovers for me they usually end up in the trash.    We will go back here for sure.  The space is small but nice, the bar area is great and has TV's and the The Orchard courtyard area is beautiful.  Parking sucks, we were luck to get a spot in the back.",

My friend suggested us meeting here for dinner last week for our girls night and at first I was a little confused as Waze was leading me to a neighborhood.  After a moment, I realized the place was tucked away in between the neighborhood.  Pomelo shares its space with Luci's and an ice cream shop.  The middle common area is adorable with picnic tables and outside eating.  Our service at Pomelo was great.  Our server was attentive and always at an arms reach if we ever needed anything.  We ordered the brussel sprouts, chefs charcuterie board and the mexican corn to share.  The sprouts and corn were fantastic but the charcuterie board was left to be desired.  We had to ask for the fig spread and grainy mustard that should've already come with the board.  It ended up that the fig spread was the best item on the board.  For my entree, I had the shrimp fettuccine which was delicious.  It was perfectly creamy with the right amount of shrimp, which by the way, were quite a decent size. My friend ordered the spinach artichoke dip which was pretty terrible.  Another ordered the roasted chicken to which she demolished it!  I assume it must've been good.  I'd definitely come back again and try their other items and sit outside and take advantage of this amazing weather.",

The space is modern, romantic and bistro-like, playing swing music and sultry French music (in the other rooms). I can see this being a great place to celebrate an anniversary or birthday.   We sat at a corner booth facing everyone in the restaurant. We were welcomed by Brian who took our drink orders and was served mainly by Alexis who took our lunch orders but everyone on the staff was just so welcoming and jovial that we were never forgotten. The manager Chad even greeted us and asked if we needed anything!   We ordered the mushroom pizza and added broccoli (+$2) and split the house fries. Both were delicious. (I recommend asking for parmesan to top off the fries!)   Afterwards we wanted to sit in the salon/cocktail lounge for desert. We had the fig and pear cobbler a la mode which could have easily fed 4 people!  The vibe of the cocktail lounge was really classy. (You could hear more of the French music playing softly) There we met two more incredibly friendly servers (Bridgette and Monica).  The cherry on top of the whole experience was the fun little message I found tiled into the floor of the women's bathroom. I don't know if it's also in the men's room but it was just a nice touch.",

Staff was friendly and kind, it has that just been opened kind of vibe and energy, hope they can keep it going.  Started with a tuna tartar to start, it was guacamole over tuna, which the silverskin was still on so it ruined the texture of the fish. All that effort and they give warmed from a bag tortilla chips, really need to make it special and give a fresh made house made chip. Sigh. Next time I'm going for street corn and pork belly.  Braised short ribs was tender and presented on a platter that was so full it was a bit much.  People would pay the same for a quality casual dining meal at half the portion they give you. Demi glace was so salty I thought they were trying to cure the short ribs after braising it. The meat was cooked well but unfortunately the demi killed it a slow salty death. It came with polenta to serve a small family and more starch... Fingerling potatoes and beans----no seasoning.... Just the oil from the pan.... So anticlimactic. BBQ pork ribs had a nice, smoke, tender, moist with a spicy sauce.... Too bad they were double stacked next to a mountain of fries and cabbage salad. Couldn't move a thing on my plate or manage to cut the ribs apart because there was so much on the platter. Fries were nice, cooked well. I think the menu says coleslaw but it's really cabbage salad.... Cabbage with Mayo based dressing. Real coleslaw usually has salt to sweat the cabbage and some vinegar perhaps for a slight pickling....give you that slight distinct tang. Unfortunately all of the above including flavor was missing.  I am so hopeful that I will return for round two because I really really like the place and I think it was a fluke or I hope it was....",

Service is good, we had an attentive server and one person actually grabbed a high chair for my daughter from the sister restaurant across the yard.  The breakfast pizza is a must try, and the chilaquiles and chopped salad were also total hits with my wife.  The cinnamon roll is also one of the best I've ever had, but I'd recommend you ask to have it after your meal.  The staff is incredibly understanding and genuinely caring and they will go the extra mile to make a good experience great. We really enjoyed this place and will *definitely* be back!!",

    "text": "I discovered Pomelo earlier this year when looking for a great place to take my girlfriend out to dinner. We sat on the patio and thoroughly enjoyed our evening. The ambiance and atmosphere was marvelous. Then just a week ago, I picked Pomelo as the location to host my daughter's high school graduation party. My mother and I worked with Event Coordinator Linda, and it was the best decision we could've made! Linda turned a basic graduation party into a True family and friends event for everyone we invited. We had our party in The Barn, had a personal attendant (Herbert) who did a fantastic job handling all of our needs for a party of 15. The food was excellent along with the service. Hats off to Linda and all the event planning staff at Pomelo! Me and my family will be long time customers to this True gem of a restaurant!",

Indoors has two dining rooms and a private dining room. The bar is well set up and staff friendly. The menu features some interesting starters, great looking salads and a small assortment of house specialties that range from  ribeye to halibut and ribs to pasta. They also have some great looking pizzas. Nice jazz plays throughout. This is an upscale on the inside casual on the outside kinda place. Moderately priced with entrees ranging from 14$ to 28$. I just stopped in for a nice IPA and to check it out on opening day and cannot wait to return for dinner!",

    "text": "I stopped into this place for lunch with one of my friends and our four kids because they were is no seating available at Lucy's which is a more relaxed, kid friendly environment. They did have a kids menu and high chairs so I figured it would be OK if we hey there. We ordered our drinks from our waiter, Ethan. The kids want to pink lemonade but there was none available so they were able to make Shirley Temple's. My daughter asked for some cherries and the waiter checked the bar and informed us that there were no cherries. Then I asked if they had any apple juice for my one-year-old. They did not. I decided to get the patty melt but I wanted to add some bacon to it. He checked with the kitchen to see if that will be OK and came back and informed us that I could not have bacon on my sandwich. I asked him why and he said that the kitchen did not have any bacon. I thought this was kind of strange. He never came back to give us any refills on our drinks and seemed annoyed with our requests for cherries and for kids cups since he brought the drinks in regular adult size cups and any parent knows that that is an accident waiting to happen. Then he came and asked us if we were ready to pay while we were still eating. I found this to be rude as well. My son was very fussy and at one point I got up and left the restaurant to try to calm him down. Once the food came he was quiet and an old lady walked past our table and thanked me for ruining her lunch. I assume her appetite was lost because my child was crying. To that old lady, there's a special place in hell for you. But I digress. My patty melt was OK but the patty itself was rare and he didn't ask me how I wanted it but if he had asked, I wouldn't have chosen rare. Patty was pretty thin so I don't know what the difficulty was in cooking it all the ways through. I ended up rushing to get out of this place because the overall experience was just kind a horrible from the service to the food to the other customers and to my fussy child. I would definitely not go back there. There are way too many better restaurants that I could be eating at.",

    "text": "Very disappointed today in our visit to Pomelo. We rented the green room for my mothers 86 birthday. There was 9 of us and everything started out pretty good. Our server was very nice and overall attentive to us. Some of us ordered Bloody Marys and they were very good. The appetizers were not bad, shrimp and calamari and a spinach dip and chips. Here is where our displeasure showed up 1. One of us ordered the green chili enchilada entree at about 12:15 off the brunch menu. Our waitress came back 10 minutes later and said they were out of the item, really! How many did they serve for breakfast (not sure they were even open for breakfast!). 2. 2 of us ordered the fish tacos..... very average at best, tasted like they were frozen pieces of cod dipped in hot oil. 3. The french dip, again very average, no flavor.  Our previous visit the pizza was good but the chef needs to get more creative with the menu and recipes. If we return it will be for the pizza and wine special.......unless they run out of pizza or wine. :-( Mike",

It wasn't crowded - we arrived around 3:30 on a Sunday afternoon - but the food took forever to arrive. There are two chicken sandwiches on the menu - I ordered the grilled one, my companion ordered crispy. The chef switched the chickens - mine was crispy, with the toppings of the grilled chicken I ordered - his was grilled with the toppings he ordered. Our waitress took them away with apologies and said her manager would bring the correct dishes. Another waitress brought the new, correct orders. The manager eventually stopped by the table and said \"sorry.\" No offer to comp or discount. We waited almost an hour for our food. Not sure we'll return.",

The food consists of quality ingredients but could be more flavorful.  Everything we tried was bland - French dip, blakt chicken sandwich, spinach dip, calamari/shrimp, strawberry shortcake and chocolate mousse cake. Next time we'll try salad and pizza. (Although there are a LOT of pizza restaurants around here these days so it needs to be very good to compete.) The bar and lounge area is so inviting and they have one of the nicest patio seating areas around. I hope they dial in the menu and condiment/seasoning problem; if they do they'll be a top-tier north central PHX dining spot.",

The beet salad needed a bit of salt and maybe some acid.  The artichoke dip was a little on the thin side but we will be back.  My main complaint is the parking.  As I said, I live in the neighborhood and am sad to see the streets beginning to get cluttered with Pomelo customers.  Nobody likes strangers walking down their street and not leaving space for visitors of the people who live on the street to park.  I would like suggest a partnership.  Maybe Pomelo could pay the church on 12th and Glendale to use their parking lot in the evening.  It's always empty and I'm sure they wouldn't say no to a little monthly fee for using their lot.  Just a thought....",

When crowded there should be a walk up section defined as with the crowd standing behind diners was not ideal waiting for drinks. We later discovered that the lawn does have cocktail service, hostess should make this point when giving you wait times.  All in all I will be returning to discover more.",

I don't know what happened here, but I am sad to say it was awful! First of all we made a reservation and arrived a little early. There was only one table taken in the place and the hostess told us since we were early we should wait at the bar. They were open for business and plenty of tables available, why couldn't we be seated? I guess if I didn't make any reservation I could have sat right down? We were going to leave when she said \"Ok, I will make an exception this one time\". My husband and daughter ordered burgers, one was supposed to be medium and one medium well. They both arrived more as medium rare with a red/pink interior, yet they had a burnt flavor. Very strange. The fries were tasteless and had a hard texture as if they were not cooked enough. I had ribs which were not meaty and very dry. Also, the  tomato on my daughters burger was the end of a tomato which should be discarded not put on an expensive burger. We were all so disappointed with our meals and told them. They took one entree off the bill so I am giving two stars for their kindness for that. The greeter/hostess has a bad attitude and the food was horrible so we all said we would not go back.",
