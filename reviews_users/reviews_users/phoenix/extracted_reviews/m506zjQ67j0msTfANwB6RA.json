When I looked at was in the bag I thought....\"I just paid 15 bucks for that\"!   but then I tasted it...the salmon didn't look like much but had a really good flavor and I ate it quickly...then I started with the salad...I didn't even need to add the dressing...it had such a great taste that I waited till only a third of it was left.   And that's only because I wanted to know what a vegan Caesar dressing tastes like...I will go back I'm sure over and over...so happy an organic place like this is so close to me..Next time...I will eat in ...I'm excited to try other menu items there.",

I stumbled across this place while visiting my boyfriend in Phoenix and I had nothing to do so I saw that this place had good reviews so I was like let me check it out. I ordered the Mother Earth bowl because I saw that most people were ordering that. And man, it was the best dish I ever had. Every component of it was super tasty! From the roasted mushrooms to the red pepper miso vinaigrette. The broccoli pesto was also unique. I added meat as well and that made everything perfect. I also ordered the sides including the Indian spiced cauliflower and smashed potatoes. Those were super tasty as well. For a \"healthy\" place, everything tastes super delightful. They also have unique rotating lemonade flavors that are super refreshing as well. I literally go here every time I visit Phoenix (I'm from california). Atmosphere is super cute too! I highly highly recommend this place to anyone.",

Rather ho hum in flavor and presentation, you know, sort of that anemic look.   I do generally LOVE mac and cheese.   It's one of my go-to comfort foods, but not in this case.  Nothing about its taste to make it stand out from the crowd.  Thought I'd try it again and met friends there for dinner last night.   I had the Madras Curry with the added in chicken.   The chicken sort of had that in between boiled chicken flavor/texture and maybe thrown on the grill for five seconds?   It was flavorless.  If you've read my prior reviews, you know I hate boiled chicken.  UGH!!   The mix of the veggies in the curry and the curry was good.   It's the Thai type of curry. It wasn't bad, but I've had it a few times at Thai restaurants and make it myself as well.   The texture, coloring of the veggies was perfect, sort of that al dente texture except for the potatoes.   The potatoes were cooked completed.   Can't do potatoes al dente and make it edible, you know.  I don't know that I'd return.  Both meals were rather ho hum, and there are too many places in town to eat ho hum food.",

Menu is simple, there was only pita bread as a bread option but not included in the salad. They had one yellow cupcake as a option as far a breads go. Baskets at register have brownies and cookies for sale. If you are in the neighborhood, looking for a unique quick bite, try flower child. They also have a very unique selections of teas and lemonades.",

Most recently, I stopped by with my mom after an active weekend at the Grand Canyon on the way to drop me off at the airport. I realized we had time and the Flower Child on Camelback was on the way! We stopped in a the space was big, bright and trendy. The girl at the counter was friendly. Like REALLY friendly. We ordered simple hummus with flat bread, my mom got a salad and I ordered the Thai cashew Quinoa with tofu. We spotted a table and claimed it quickly. I sipped on a local beer while my mom debated between 6 different delcious-looking iced teas and lemonades from fountains.  The hummus came out quick and was simple, but delicious. Garnished with peppers and kalamata olives and accompanied with house made flatbread, we enjoyed it thoroughly. Our entrees came out quickly after. My Thai cashew Quinoa was amazing! The flavor was savory and delicious and the tofu was expertly seared and perfectly flavored. My mom enjoyed her salad as well.  If there was a flower child without an hour of my house, I would eat there several times weekly. Please open in Seattle!!",

The decor is super cute and fits with the hippie chic vibe they have going on there. If you're looking for a quick and healthy meal this is the place",

The iced tea and lemonades were delicious, the food fresh and yummy, and the service was stellar. The non-vegetarians in the group equally loved their dishes. The restaurant is so adorable, SO SO adorable. They even have a cute hand washing station (awesome!). So MUCH YES YES YES! Now if only they could open one closer to Chandler. Hahaha!

Entering the restaurant , I was transported to a big city with a hip local joint where all the cool kids go to eat. Now when I looked around it was a lot of Mature Mamas like me, but let's pretend the cool kids were there. The  name Flower Child first invoked a hippie vibe but this was beyond hippie.  Loved the vintage , garden, uptown feel , with open spaces, peace sign mural and unisex bathrooms.  I can't wait to go back. The egg quinoa bowl I had was super tasty and not what I expected.  I haven't had a love affair with quinoa like some have had so I wasn't sure it was my cup of tea. But I was ready to lick the bowl with its tangy richness. What an unexpected pleasure. Flower Child please open up a franchise in the Northwest Valley and I promise to be your Hippie Chick forever.",

The staff is all so friendly and helpful; there was a young lady at the front asking people if they had been in before and providing help ordering, etc. I went with her recommendation on a wrap, The Rebel, and it was delicious! I got a side of the roasted beet, avocado and tangerines and that was super yummy as well. The portion was large, I only ate half for lunch and had the other half for dinner; which was good because the meal (wrap, side and a drink) was on the pricy side for lunch, about $20.  The atmosphere is light and happy, it's a beautiful space. A good place to hang out and do some work or read a book. Everyone was friendly and seemed happy. I've gone back for lunch a second time and brought a friend, we both had the Flying Avocado wrap which was really good and I had to try their gluten free mac and cheese....YUM!

My friend enjoyed her salad. The hummus was okay, the pitas were okay. They have a lot of tasty looking things on their menu so I'm looking forward to coming back.

    "text": "I'm a surprised fan of Flower Child.  My girlfriend found it while we were looking for a spot to grab a quick breakfast on our way to the airport.  She originally found some basic breakfast sandwich places, but then cam across Flower Child, and she obviously loved it for the vegan and vegetarian options (I say that as if you all know who my girlfriend is and that she's vegetarian), and as they had some carnivore options, too, it seemed like a perfect place.    They took our order over the phone, but we arrived before it was ready.  First thing I noticed was the cute outdoor patio.  There wasn't much to look at, seeing as how it's in a strip mall, but nevertheless, it was a nice place to sit outside.  The inside is also very bright and airy - a very comfortable place to eat.  Their menu is pretty healthy looking with, again, lots of vegan and vegetarian options but something for everyone.  It's a counter order and they bring you your food, kind of place.    We both got the quinoa breakfast burrito - scrambled eggs, heirloom bean, corn, roasted chile, avocado, smoked gouda.  I subbed out the avocado for spinach and added smoked turkey.  It comes with a side of salsa.  Quinoa struck me as a strange ingredient in a breakfast burrito, but it really worked.  This was a delicious burrito.  Not only did it taste great, but it was stuffed and filled.  Probably could have used a bit more protein and a bit less quinoa, but it wasn't overwhelming.  Great find by my love, and a great place for you lucky Phoenixans.  Phoenixers.  People in Phoenix.",

I really like Flower Child, because even though it's healthy, it's not like some places with similar concepts where it feels like you're eating/drinking grass & cardboard. I like the option where you can get a protein (or tofu) and pair it with few sides. This is what I did when I came here.  I got the tofu (which I've gotten in the past and knew I liked). I also got steamed broccoli. It was pretty plain, but it's what I expected and it was cooked well. I also got the sweet potato, which was delicious (it a has a little bit of kick to it)!  It was kind of an unexpected lunch stop when I came in, but it was PACKED on a weekday, which I'm guessing is normally the case here given the area. We didn't have to wait too long (I was with one other person who also ordered tofu and two sides), but for a place that you order from the counter (normally I think of places like this to have quick service) we did wait a little bit. I'm not sure I'd come here if I were in a hurry even though it's a quick concept kind of place.",

It definitely doesn't feel like it even though you walk up to order on your own.  Just love all the details.....even in the restrooms. Anyhow, on to the food....great, healthy, tasty choices. The menu doesn't really change that often, if ever.  There are some standby items I get regularly....my favorite being the Kale Salad with added shaved chicken.  It never fails!  The plates are good too....mixing up the veggies with a protein is always a good choice.  But, I feel like the portions are a little small on the platter style meals (in comparison to the cost, that is).  The homemade natural teas and lemonades are fabulous but also a bit on the pricey side.  Overall, the food is always very good here but the prices just don't line up.  So, the only real negative about this place is I could probably go to a sit-down (i.e. have a waiter take my order and serve me) for the cost of a meal here.",

You get 1 slice smeared with avocado, maybe a half of a small egg, Parmesan cheese and toasted sesame seeds. Then they cut it in 3 slices. I will never come back. I will not recommend someone to come here either. I am still hungry and will need to get more food elsewhere. My friend's breakfast burrito was a good size and he enjoyed it. The coffee was good. Just disappointed.",

First, it was 12:30 on a workday afternoon. The place was packed, AND VERY LOUD. The staff set up tables for us outside. But they put 5 tables up against the outside wall. How are 7 people, who haven't seen each other for 4 months, supposed to talk in that setting? Eventually they cleared 2 round tables for us and we moved to them. Not ideal but better than facing a wall. I will say for a very hot day in June the misters worked fairly well.   I got the skinny cob. It might have been a good salad but it was so slimy and wet, it was kinda gross texture-wise. It was only $8 and I got water. Although, there were good drink options I didn't want  to pay $3.50.   I will say the ordering process was easy and the staff was very accommodating. They cleared our dishes and kept checking back.   Even if we had good seats inside I wouldn't go back because it's way too loud. And the salad was truly horrible. I make much better salads at home.",

    "text": "I really was looking forward to an early lunch at Flower Child this past Sunday March 3rd 2019. I had the avocado toast and the red rice bowl with broccoli and shaved beef (an added protein option).  Not sure of the actual name. The avo toast was delicious, but I couldn't finish the rice, broccoli and beef, because the broccoli was burned.  The burned broccoli flavor and smell literally killed what could have been a great dish. The beef was tender, the sauce was tasty, but the burned broccoli was awful.  Honestly, this meal for one person cost $28 (including a coffee) and I just feel gipped. Too bad.  For the pricing of the food, each dish should really be spot on.",

Too many places right in the neighborhood that are working hard for my hard earned money.  This place doesn't care.

The nice thing about this was there's a little table with cups and a water jug thing with lemon in it. So nice. Otherwise you can get your own drink inside. Her and I both got the mother bowl. It has quinoa, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, kale, and caramelized onions. It was so yummy, light, and the PERFECT combination. Seriously. I definitely will be back to have that or something else.

The noodles however seemed to break too easily, the steak was yummy. A little too thick but still filling overall.  Husband had the Forbidden rice w/steak and he liked his plate as well.  We shared the sauteed spinach & cauliflower - yummy. We'd order it again. Our 4yo had the chicken w/broccoli & Parmesan and brown rice. Broccoli could have been a bit more tender but overall a hit.  Will we be back? Not sure. It's great, but over priced in our opinion ($50). Guess it'll depend how hungry we are.",

I am so pleased with this place! Decor is stunning & inviting all at once. Casual and upbeat. The food was very pure, I ordered two sides, I know not very adventurous. I got the gluten free mac & cheese and the chicken. The girl at the counter was very helpful in answering my questions and making suggestions on what I should try. The food did not disappoint & I am honestly already thinking about that Mac & cheese! I will be back to try more whenever I find myself on that side of town!",

Everything about it was perfect. The staff was friendly and helpful, the restaurant was clean and obviously well run, and the food was outstanding! I had The Flying Avocado bu there were many other things on my he menu that I can't wait to try! It's so nice to have this type of restaurant that serves food that's actually healthy! My only complaint is that there isn't a Flower Child location in Chicago!",

My boyfriend and I tried the strawberry salad, they kindly split it into two bowls for us. The fennel mixed with strawberry and coconut was such a good mixture. We also got two sides which were $7 total. Japanese eggplant which came with cashews and some kind of sauce then sweet and sour squash! This was just such a good combination all together. I highly recommend this place if you are looking for clean eating and a plant based diet.",

The only reason I'm not giving 5 stars is that this place is RIDICULOUSLY OVERPRICED. I get it, healthy, high quality ingredients cost more but this place is over-the-top.

I ordered a plate with three items: butternut squash with toasted huckleberries and maple glaze, steamed broccoli and brown rice. You might think that's boring but you'd be WRONG because it was the literal BEST butternut squash I've ever eaten! I bought the entire meal AGAIN to-go before leaving so I can eat it again tomorrow. I also tried the Wild Tonic kombucha on tap and it was divine. A jun kombucha, it uses honey instead of cane sugar and it was so delicious I would have gotten another one of those too but instead went to their website to see where else I can buy it at the store when I return home to SoCal. There were definitely some interesting folks and I will absolutely go to this restaurant again in another city if I travel to any of their other locations.",

She even gave us tips on her favorite dishes and the substitutions she uses to make them even better.  We settled on the Thai Cashew Bowl and the Mother Earth Bowl with a dressing change that she suggested.  We loved them both, and the dressing change was a great move - thanks Kayla!!!

    "text": "I was so excited to eat here!  I love the name, the \"Flower Child\" since I grew up in this era.  The restaurant is old school, retro, with shelves of vintage objects, industrial lighting, organic foods menu.  LOTS OF SEATING.  A picture of Twiggy is on the east wall, who was one of the 1966 fashion's,  first, super model, ever!  She was short  at 5'6\", weighed 112 pounds, but was influencing fashion, hair and makeup for generations to come.    There is a \"peace sign\" painted over her face, which is strange and confusing,  because she was British and wasn't involved in any Viet Nam protests, like Joan Baez or Jane Fonda were.  So they should use one of their images instead, with a peace sign,  Fonda and Baez symbolized peace and protest, not Twiggy.    In addition, a peace sign is a Missle,  encircled...a little history lesson, no extra charge.    With that said, the food was JUST OK and very expensive.  Two wraps, a tiny plate of spinach, soup and a lemonade put me back $38!!!  Definitely not, \"1960 era prices!\"    We were honestly, still hungry, when we finished.. could have eaten, much more,  than I received at The Flower Child.  Bags of spinach cost 99 cents, field greens, 99 cents.  MY WRAP had some kind of turkey lunch meat in it...  Lose the tip jar, staff didn't do one thing to warrant a tip, no one came by to ask,\" how our food was\", no one got us a refill of lemonade. It is, all SELF service, So why, the exorbitant prices??  $13 For a half a wrap, for heaven's sake.    I got a rap, alright,  \"Baby, I got ripped...\"  My friend had half a bowl of soup and a similar half a wrap, half the size of a normal wrap, (we have bought wraps, before, at Pita Jungle, full wrap, salad and you are waited on for $10.79)  ...this is outrageous pricing...we could have ordered  two meals, with salad and appetizer at Chili's for $22.    Lesson learned, the decor is 5 star, food, service and prices 0 star.  So next time, if I ever return, I will order the cucumber mint lemonade and guzzle a few cups for $3.50 but no tiny food plates, big prices.  Remember it is 1966 inside your restaurant,  your prices should reflect that.",

To be honest it is one of my favorite places to eat in town. I have had numerous meals here with Yelp and without Yelp and even on the holidays and my birthday. I have tried so many dishes I could not review them all. The last time we stopped in they even had a fourth of July holiday meal special. Since it was my birthday my BFF treated me.  All I will say is that I have never had a bad meal here ever. I love their Hummus APP and also their amazing assortments of soda and teas. The food is fresh, the service is beyond amazing, and the restaurant is clean, and attractive. PS- good desserts too.",

    "text": "I am a fan of this delightfully healthy restaurant. With an inviting, open concept environment Flower Child allows adults and children to eat healthy and truly enjoy the food and beverages that are delivered to their table. There are a couple of things to be aware of. First, eating organic and healthy tends to be a bit more expensive and Flower Child is no exception to this rule. For my daughter and I to eat lunch here, the cost is $25.50 without tax and tip. Also, this is a popular place to eat so be prepared to wait in line.   When it comes to food, my favorite selections are the whole grain wraps. There are few places that get healthy wraps right, but Flower Child does! I specifically like the Flying Avocado and Bird is the Word. My daughter orders off of the Healthy Kids menu where she gets to choose one protein(grass fed beef, chicken, or tufu) and two sides (broccoli, smashed potato, corn & quinoa, mac & cheese, brown rice or clementines & apples). I love that they don't serve soda. Instead you have the options of delicious teas, lemonades, water or drinks in the refrigerator. My personal favorite is the green tea, unbelievably good!",

We both got the Heirloom Burrito Bowl (I believe that's what it was called, I can't seem to find it on the menu now! I hope they didn't get rid of it :/). It had tomatoes in some amazing kind of sauce, quinoa, corn, avocado and beans and lots of other great stuff! I would definitely get this bowl again - so healthy and filling without feeling grossly full afterward, and it was so tasty. We also got their gluten free chocolate chip cookie, which was amazing. I feel like a lot of times those kinds of desserts taste like something is missing, but this one didn't at all.   The atmosphere inside Flower Child is great as well. Tons of light coming in, cute tables and different options for where to sit, and it's a great spot to get some work done too. They also have a bunch of outdoor seating options! Next time I definitely want to try their lemonade; they have so many great sounding flavors! I'd love to come in for breakfast sometime as well :)",

It's in a great shopping center of a gourmet grocery store and lots of other stores and eating options.    I love the order yourself places where you don't have to wait for someone to come to your table.  Came with a family relative and had an easy time finding veggie oriented items on the menu. It's grouped into salads plates and bowls.  The salad section alone was pretty amazing I wanted to try everything.  They had a kale salad a veggie salad a Vietnamese crunch salad a Mediterranean one, a Brussels and squash. They even have one called vegan ingredient.  They also list on the menu that you can sub out any dressing for their lemon avo dressing that is sugar free and simple.    Their plates are really innovative in that you pick one two or three items from the menu to make a plate.  The more you pick the price drops down to $3 a plate which is to me a good deal considering everything is organic.    We tried the vegan salad, the forbidden black rice bowl with veggies, and the vegan poke bowl.  Basically you pick your table and they deliver your food when ready.    The space is well lit and modern with cool artwork on the walls and an open kitchen where you can see all the chefs in action making the dishes.  The time to get your dishes was not that long.  Considering it was pretty packed at lunch I was really impressed how on top they were with keeping up with all the orders.   Food we ordered was really tasty and well presented.  The forbidden rice is a must get dish.  So many flavors and super healthy with all the veggies.  The vegan salad was also large in size and very tasty.  Pole bowl was simple but very innovative.    I'm so glad I got a chance to stop here and I think this could very well become my go to spot to hang out when in Phoenix.  Good job bravo!",

Means that a lot of foods have pesticides residue left on them  Flower Child uses only organic products and they are using products that are pesticide free !!!' This is my kind of dining !!! The food is delicious, it's clean it's a fun environment and I like that I can pick and choose the items that I would like to add to my plate I'm not committed to just one whole plate .

We paid $30 for two plates which is common for these restaurants and all options we looked at seemed to be GF, which is awesome. When I asked about the difference between the chicken and the steak add-in's, the register dude asked if I knew the difference between chicken and steak being that one is chicken and the other is steak. I was surprised with his answer and the rest of my stay was weird to say the least. The tables weren't clean, we were pointed around the corner to fetch our silverware and water.  Once we got the food, we were impressed by the portions (Mother Earth Bowl + Chicken and 2 Side bowl + steak). Steak was chewy/fatty but chicken was good. The difference between the chicken and steak included the marinade: steak was slightly spicy and chicken herb-y. The sauce on the Mother Earth was great.  I would go back in the future but would stay away from the steak and asking \"stupid\" questions at the register.  4/5 stars  --UPDATE STARTS BELOW--  My wife and I gave Flower Child a second try and were blown away this visit. Staff was kind and engaging, tables were clean and service was prompt. We also tried some of the GF goodies and loved them!  We will definitely be back in the near future!  5/5 stars",

    "text": "We visited on Sunday, August 7th at 1:00 p.m.  Counter service and food - great!  I had the Freebird wrap - very yummy!  My lunch companion had the Forbidden Rice and stated it was delicious.  This was a 5-star experience until the end of my meal.  Busser service - not so good!  I had literally just ate the last bite of food and put my fork in the bowl - as soon as the fork hit the bowl this guy just grabbed the bowl and walked away!  There was no communication whatsoever - 'how was your meal', 'glad to have you join us today', 'do you need anything else' - nothing.  It was as if there was a mad rush on bowls and the kitchen was out of them and he was getting a bonus based on how quick he could remove them from tables.  I observed him do this same thing with other tables - one woman was still chewing her food and he grabbed her bowl without saying a single word.  People had a somewhat shocked look on their faces - as did I.  My lunch companion wondered if we were being rushed to leave (there were plenty of open tables).  Did I need the bowl and fork any longer? Probably not.  It would have been much better to wait until all parties have completed their meals before removing the entree plates or at least have the courtesy to ask and not just grab and go.  He was young, tall, medium to thin build, black hair, white and wore thick framed black glasses.  All was great until the 'grab and go' - amazing how one person can negatively impact an otherwise good experience.",

After leaving, I began to feel nauseous so I called back to make sure that a manager was aware and to ensure proper inspection of the steak.

Anyway, this was my first time here, but I have heard many great things about it! You walk in, order, take a number, a seat and then your food will magically appear in a timely fashion! I ordered the winter sunshine salad with chicken, while my boyfriend got the \"forbidden\" rice bowl with chicken. Both very good, but the portion is small for the price. Flower child also has a variety of ice teas and lemonades that I believe are made in house, and you can refill for free!  Service is very friendly and fast. The decor is very fitting with the name of the restaurant. It's beautiful and fun. There is a patio outside, which during the day or when it's not winter in Arizona, I can see being a great choice! I would come here again!",

    "text": "Flower Child is my go-to spot for a healthy weekend lunch. Sometimes, it's my go to for a healthy weeknight dinner.   PROs: You can mix and match the proteins and the different formats easily--this means you can tweak your favorites, but you don't have to. The options are good for you, but still manage to feel decadent and often the flavor combinations are exciting (I love the sweet potato-broccoli pesto combo in the Mother Earth, and the heirloom beans - greek yogurt combo in the Late Riser). The roasted brussels and chili glazed sweet potatoes are both sides worth trying.   CONs: during rushes, the walk up and order situation is crowded and confusing and the dining room is not in the greatest of shape. Generally speaking, I'm not a fan of the whole \"order and take your number yourself to a table.\" Once, I took a number and there were no tables... Which is to say, this seems like a system ripe for poor handling. I'm sure brunch here is great, but I'm not willing to fight the crowd to try it out.  I'm also taking a star off because the $7 avocado toast is ONE slice of toast with a quarter of an avocado and ONE egg. What is this, Manhattan? There's actually a picture of it on Y and it looks much more loaded... but caveat emptor that's a trick of scale. IT'S A SMALL PIECE OF BREAD.",

I got the Grains and Green salad with tofu and it was really tasty. The only downside is that they don't give you a large portion so you may leave hungry despite paying over $10 for the meal. Close to $20 if you get a salmon add-on. The tofu isn't too greasy (and it's organic!). My brother got the Indian inspired bowl but it didn't have rice on it.   If you're looking for a healthy place to eat this is it! It definitely qualifies for \"clean eating.\"",

Last night, I really wanted to eat somewhere healthy and that my mom would love (she is pretty picky) so I hoped that Flower Child was the answer and it was!!  We came last night and the restaurant is pretty open, big and similar to the Sauce concept - you wait in line to order at the counter, get a number while you get your drinks, sit and they bring your order to you.  We ordered the Avocado Hummus, the Rebel Wrap, and the Forbidden Rice bowl with shaved chicken = less than $40. We received the hummus first which included pita bread. I wasn't a big fan of it because the pita bread was thin and flimsy and the hummus was alright. I don't think it was worth $7. However, the forbidden rice and rebel wrap were delicious! I think that the portions weren't bad - two entrees and one appetizer filled three people.   I noticed their iced teas and lemonades after we ordered and was considering going back in line to just get a drink. However, after eating our food, I just knew I would be a regular here so I decided to hold off and get an iced tea the next time I dine in. My mom and hubby loved the food too.   The next morning, we placed a to-go breakfast order for the Late Riser and the Green Garden bowls  = a little over $20. It was so filling and appetizing! My favorite was the Green Garden - scrambled eggs, spinach, roasted brussels sprouts, broccoli, charred onion, tuscan kale pesto, greek yogurt, prairie breeze cheddar! I was quite impressed that all those greens can be included in a bowl and be so good!",

There's plenty of seating but it can get crowded especially on weekends. They have some outdoor seating too that's good during the winter. Their prices are pretty good, I don't feel overcharged. My absolute favorite dish is the Thai Dye wrap. Never have I had a tofu base dish was so much flavor! I always get a lemonade. They make them fresh and have different flavors to choose from. My personal favorite is the rose lemonade when they have it. Parking lot can be a little tight but I have always been able to find a spot. You can do dine, order to go, or do An online order. They also have little snacks at the front that can be hard to resist. They cater to gluten-free, vegan, vegetarian with options and their food clearly labeled for each. This is one of my favorite places to grab lunch or dinner in Phoenix!",

Parking:  Near AJs - lots of parking available. This is better than the 44th St location where parking is a pain!   Service: Fantastic! The staff take one's order at the front, then deliver it later. They are friendly and cheery.   Food: Amaze! I love so many things here.  Recently, I ordered the spicy cauliflower, glazed sweet potatoes, and fruit. The fruit was boring. However, the sweet potatoes are delicious with a sneaky spice, and the cauliflower has a crisp caramelized taste.   The teas and lemonades are interesting and fun to mix together.  The cupcakes / desserts taste fairly fresh.  I have also ordered the hummus, which was creamy and well made.   The recent time, the guy I was with had the pho. I personally would never order pho at FC (only at a True Vietnamese place), but he seemed to like it.   Atmosphere:  Fun, light with windows everywhere. There are seats outside, and lots of flowering pots outside.    Cost: The cost is pretty high, but the quality is great.   I went at 11:30 AM on a Saturday, but at around 1pm, we noted the line was out the door.",

Regardless if you need to/prefer to eat gluten-free, vegan, whatever, I can guarantee there is something to satisfy your savoring!   We stopped in a couple nights before leaving Arizona and it wasn't crazy busy. Perhaps, it was because it was right between Christmas and NYE, but we weren't complaining! The food came out quickly and presentation was nice. Better yet, the food was delish!  Bird is the Word Wrap was my choice - so yum!

I was dragged in, kicking and screaming \"There is nothing on this menu that I would ever eat!\"   So my daughter ordered for me.   I thought that MIGHT nibble on the Red Chili Glazed Sweet Potato, Clementine & Organic Apple and Sustainable Salmon (whatever that is) because I refused to go without MEAT!  However, I ended up eating ALL of the Sichuan Green Beans that my daughter insisted I try, half of her Organic Kale Salad and most of her Yusu Brussels Sprouts and Roasted Butternut Squash!  I completely forgot about the salmon. On my second trip, I had ALL of the afore-mentioned dishes, plus the Tomato Toast and the gluten-free Mac & Cheese, something I would only eat if it was made at home or at a reputable soul food restaurant. Anything else always tasted like it came out of a blue box by Kraft - greasy and tasteless.  I was pleasantly surprised by Flower Child's version of a Southern favorite. I passed on the meats - All-Natural Chicken, Grass-Fed Steak or the salmon. These veggies are so well-seasoned make meat an unnecessary afterthought.  I plan on eating my way through the entire menu.  After 69 years of avoiding vegetables by any means necessary, Flower Child has converted me! #IAmFlowerChild",

I am very familiar with other restaurants in the area but this week chose to take a friend out of for lunch and she was keen to check it out.  The service was great at the counter and we didn't have to wait long.  I was taken aback at the price of a bowl plus salmon but thought it would be worth it.  I was shocked at the tiny amount of food, almost as if it was the end of 'pot' Thw salmon was infinitesimal and, for a moment, I thought it was a joke.  $9 for the bowl and $7 for the salmon was ridiculous.  I have no problem spending on good food and I would rather have gone to St Francis and paid $10 more for their Superfood Salmon dish or to Sauce across the road, $13 for a generous proportion of quinoa, arugula and salmon.  I have never been disappointed with that.  I feel incredibly let down as I had high expectations.  There are so many great eating places along the Camelback Corridor that one doesn't have to be shortchanged for a high dollar.",

    "text": "I have been here several times because my boyfriend and I absolutely love the ginger miso dressing, but the last few times we've ordered from them, the food has been inconsistent. The chopped salad I ordered last night came with wilted lettuce and was missing avocado (the best part!), the Indian spiced cauliflower and sauteed spinach were cold as if it had been refrigerated and then thrown in the container, and the chicken and rice soup was just off. The service is generally weak as well; they regularly underestimate the time it will take them to get your order ready. Often times, you can see your order sitting there waiting patiently in the bag getting cold while the cashiers run around. The problem here is not a lack of people working - there are a ton of people behind that counter - but rather a lack of organization. If it weren't so ridiculously expensive for the small amount of food you get, I'd continue to eat there in spite of the inconsistency because it's healthy. We order two soups for one person because you get such a small amount, and we are fit people. If it were 100% amazing every single time, it would be worth the cost and we'd continue to go there despite the cost. But it's not. Consistency is important, especially when you're paying $4 for six bites of cauliflower",

I even wore my favorite Summer of Love tie-dyed t-shirt with matching love beads and headband. OK, I didn't but the Jefferson Airplane was in my head, man. Groovy. Anyway, this place is all about the organic revolution with its heavy emphasis on local sourcing. I came here on a recent business trip to Phoenix and I was trying to keep to healthy eating.  It's an order-at-the-counter type of spot with a lot of seating. The menu appears to span the globe encompassing entree salads, mix-n-match sides, protein-optional bowls, and whole grain wraps. I was intrigued by the $9 Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl because it mentioned three things I like right off the bat. Since I was going to expense it and didn't eat that much that day, I had them add salmon for an additional $7. The sum product was quite a hearty portion with the red quinoa mixed with zucchini, snap peas, onion, celery, shiitake mushrooms, jalapeno, Thai basil, and of course, cashews.  That was quite a bounty of flavor which I kicked up a notch with a liberal dousing of hot pepper sauce. But no, that wasn't enough for me as a slab of fresh salmon was piled on top of it (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2Cyp0Gv&s=ff7b93104ac8ece45ea2a2eb884a57f39f29e2da5b338d9cf1b0290c63a8691d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2Cyp0Gv</a>), and yes, it was a seaworthy piece of overkill. Tasty but I really didn't need it to complete the bowl. Meanwhile, I wet my whistle with a $3 Cranberry Pomegranate Lemonade which just hit the spot with a puckery sweetness (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2B6Bzwe&s=063be8b7bd3d8287d41e3a23a450dee626c761e5d4d916ef415ce03dac37c257\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2B6Bzwe</a>). Free refills were a nice treat of which I took full adventage. It seemed fitting there was a lemonade stand out on the sprinkler-spritzing terrace. Peace, love, and lemonade, man, and put some flowers in your hair.  FOOD - 4 stars...plethora of fresh flavors though the salmon was too much for me AMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious but not quite groovy SERVICE - 3 stars...I ordered it, they brought it, the end TOTAL - 4 stars...where are my love beads?",

I have grown to love this restaurant in the past few years especially after eating in other \"healthy\" spots in the area (I call these places a poor man's Flower Child).  Yes this place is definitely pricey - I spend an average of $16-$18 for a bowl just for myself. Note: you spend a lot less when you opt to not have protein in your bowl. (All the bowls are less than $10) I can definitely justify spending a lot at Flower Child. The ingredients are fresh and healthy and the bowls are absolutely delicious.   My favorite is the Mother Earth bowl. As a not so huge fan of sweet potato, I was impressed with how they made it. It blended so well with the grains, mushrooms, pesto and all the other ingredients. This dish is flawless. I always like adding medium grass fed steak. I've had the Thai cashew quinoa and the Late Riser (breakfast menu) in the past which were very good.",

No, this is a Fox Concepts restaurant, not without funding, that charges a good deal per dish!   So, if you are trying to cut back on any one of a number of nutrients (carbs, fat, sugar, calories, sodium, etc.), don't trust the healthy facade to come through with data.   I'll definitely try again once I know what's in my meal.",

It is difficult finding better vegetables in this town, and the selection of bowls, wraps, or even salads are all above average and won't leave you feeling regret.   I also don't think anyone can top their lemonades, with varieties like Rose Petal or Carrot-Ginger.   I never regret coming here for lunch.",

    "text": "Yummy food! I love roasted or grilled veggies and this place has some of the tastiest I've eaten. The hummus is great as well. My favorite is the roasted Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes. The food is mostly healthy with vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free options. Meat is an option for those who are not vegan/vegetarian but really the veggies here are amazing.   The portions are not the typical fat American size but they are plenty filling. I have heard complaints about paying too much for a little scoop of food. I'm a pig and like to eat. I'm used to large portions so I can see why some people may be a little put off. I will admit when my food came out (I had the roasted sweet potatoes, Brussels sprouts, hummus and eggplant) I was thinking it didn't look like much but It was more than enough.   I like the decor too. It has a lot of earthy tones :)  I do like the whole hippie vibe but this doesn't take it too far. It's a very clean, upscale, hippie/flower child decor. Some of the menu items are a little on the higher price ( a few of the all natural drinks) but for the most part this place is affordable with great food. I certainly recommend this place.",

Could be better: Their assigned seating system seems to be cumbersome even for the staff. Unless you have been here before you could end up in the takeout-only line and not even know it because the line is usually out the door. Their assigned seating process goes something like this... If a number is not given to you, you cannot stand in line to order. Once you are given a number you may place your food order. So just be prepared to stand and wait in a lot of different lines. In my opinion, because of the popularity of this resturaunt, I think they could better serve their customers by offering a traditional wait service with a separate to-go area.",

No holiday decor, no festive atmo during the week between christmas and new year.  I regret leaving a tip on our take out order.  Location was nearly empty on 12/27.  We stepped in to get a quick \"take away\" order only to wait nearly 20 minutes and see others who ordered 5 minutes after us, walk away with their food before ours was ready.  This didn't make sense since there was almost no one there.  No help finding water cups and no lids offered knowing we were driving.  Not a stellar experience for 2 ready-made sides, 4 oz of grilled tofu and a simple tofu wrap.",

The wraps are freshly made and the avocado spread is great.   They have a side dish of corn and it is really tasty, resembling the flavors of corn souffle.   The teas and lemonades are also all great! I tried a bunch of flavors and even mixed. The mango iced tea is my favorite. Next time, I want to try the avacado hummus!",

    "text": "Having been an omnivore (leaning heavily on carnivore) all my life, I never sought to eat at Flower Child which has that healthy image. I couldn't imagine plant-based foods having a variety of flavors. In recent weeks, I decided to incorporate a little more veggies in my diet (due to health issues) and came here to just try it out. That was last Thursday.  I have been to Flower Child to eat 3 times since, and it's only Monday.   I ordered the Mother Earth with the steak as protein. Oh. My. Goodness. It was absolutely delicious!! After my first bite of the ancient grains, I had to stop momentarily to examine what I was eating because it was so very tasty. There was such a variety on the shallow bowl and each was placed in its own little section (well, the sliced steak sat atop the sauteed mushrooms, but they worked well together in sharing that piece of realty on the bowl). The pistachio pesto tasted so good when combined with the ancient grains! Before I knew it, I had finished everything and felt really full. And the steak was not even that big (maybe 4 or 5 oz?) so I had to wonder how I my stomach and palette was satiated by... dare I say... plants and fungi!!  Now, this place is NOT cheap considering the portions, as in I couldn't afford to eat lunch here everyday (I wish I could!), but with how much flavor and texture there is in the food, it's really quite worth it. It's really as gourmet as fast, healthy food goes!  The environment feel cozy even though it's a wide, open space. Maybe it's the decor but it's a very comfortable and clean surrounding.  And how awesome is it that the bathrooms are co-ed AND clean? It doesn't just benefit those who are transgender. I mean, ladies, how many times have you gone to a restaurant with one bathroom each for men and women, and you find yourself crossing your legs in front of the occupied women's bathroom, and wistfully eyeing the men's bathroom with the \"vacant\" sign? Flower Child is very thoughtful of your bladder too in that sense.  Anyway, I highly recommend Flower Child (seriously, try Mother Earth if you haven't before). Both your stomach and tongue will thank you for it!  Oh, an upside to now eating 85% plant-based foods for me? I lost 9 lbs in a little over 2 weeks without consciously \"dieting\" and no exercising at all.",

The food was fabulously fresh, so it would have been well worth the wait.  I was feeling like Kale and they of course had a Kale salad that hit the spot. And there's quite the menu. I don't normally like to repeat places, but this is going to have to be repeated. But if I can give you any advice, check out the menu before you go if you're a first timer. It's a little overwhelming when there's people behind you, and you're not sure what you want.",

    "text": "I really want to love this place. It has so many vegan options that I should be in heaven! But, every time I try it, I walk away with \"meh\" on my mind. It's not that I don't like it - I just don't love it.  Two visits ago I had the Thai Dye, which is a wrap with tofu and veggies. The flavor was just okay, and it was an absolute mess to eat. It fell apart and the sauce was very sticky. I needed a wet nap.   On my most recent visit I got the Forbidden Rice Bowl, with added tofu. Again, it was fine, but it wasn't fantastic. The rice was flavorful and firm, the veggies were cooked well, etc. There was a very light red chili hoisin flavor - nothing too distinct but not offensive. I liked how thinly sliced the carrots and other veggies were, and it was a decent sized serving - enough for two meals for me. However, the tofu was just a block of sliced baked tofu with no flavor. It wasn't marinated or mixed in with the food. It would have been better if it was sauteed with the bowl ingredients rather than just placed on top.   My friend got two portions of the mac and cheese (not vegan) and seemed to enjoy it. She finished it off.  The service was fine and I didn't have to wait to order at the counter, but the atmosphere at Flower Child is what I'll call \"high energy\" - very loud, crowded and busy. It's not a good place for a lunchtime conversation, and certainly not some place I can bring my extended family to since we wouldn't be able to hear each other. It's great for a quick healthy bite, but not a mainstay in my restaurant rotation.",

My favorites are the Mother Earth bowl, the Vegan Ingredient salad, and the gluten free Mac and cheese. They also have many flavors of fresh lemonade and iced tea.   The prices are a bit higher than your average fast casual restaurant, but I believe the spectacular service makes up for it. We came today during the lunch rush and took our place at the end of a very long line. The employees made our wait much smoother by serving complimentary mango pineapple lemonade samples and offering to save us a table for our party ahead of time.   I always leave satisfied knowing I had a healthy, nutritious and delicious meal!",

Everything was delicious! She was right about the Brussels sprouts. Felt like a nice healthy meal & I was full. I took off one star due to the price. For just me with the two items I got was $20+ . I could have gone to a sit down restaurant and been served for that price, here you order at a counter. So I would say it's too pricey but the food was good!",

Today I stopped in for dinner with a girlfriend and ordered the Mother Earth bowl, no grains, extra veggies and no miso glaze on the sweet potato add chicken. It was delicious! The combination of pesto, chicken and the soft sweet potato is great. Despite my picky ish order it came out perfect - except the avocado was missing! For how much you pay at this restaurant I was a little bummed but super hungry and ate it without noticing the missing ingredient until afterwards.   They offer breakfast on the weekends, lunch and dinner. They also have a great grab and go cold case with coffees, juices, kombuchas, etc. They serve kombucha on tap, gluten free sweets and local spirits! Very Instagram worthy decor on the inside. Great spot for healthy food!",

Red chili glazed sweet potato which had a very good flavor and sweet corn and quinoa, which I found flavorless and a waste of $5. I also ordered an Iced tea. all to go. They gave me a cup to fill up my iced Tea. No ice, I asked a server if the ice machine was broken and she said no, we'll fill it. I stood there for over five minutes ( I had the time to kill while my order was being prepared) The lady server and the man she had motioned to all continued to do whatever work they were doing. You know 5 mins is a long time to stare at people working and stand by a ice machine.  Again, my order had to be made, I figured just wait for the ice. I'm in Arizona. I ordered a $4 ICED Tea. Finally, I figured my order was almost done. I gave up on the ice and picked up my to go. As I was leaving another 5 mins later (10 total), I seen them going to fill the ice. Must be a complete pain in the butt to have a ice machine that staff must refill. That place is always busy and I paid $29 for my lunch- They can afford an automatic Ice machine. First world problems, I know. But $29 for lunch- Give me ICE!!! We're in the desert after all. So price vs taste vs satisfaction... I'll go somewhere else next time.",

The flavors are amazing and I love the mushrooms and the sweet potato. I never add meat because I truly feel like you don't need it and it gets WAY too expensive if you add meat to it. The bowl without meat is just $9 which is pretty reasonable. I honestly haven't tried many other things then the Mother Earth bowl so I'm not sure what else is good, but I will say that you can rack up a bill pretty quickly here especially if you are getting meat with your meal or adding drinks. Kombucha on tap is $6. Pretty crazy. Other then the pricing being pretty high, you can tell that they use quality ingredients and it's a great place for a healthy meal.",

When I received my salad, which was given to me by a very bland and uninterested waitress, I noticed a long black hair on the salad. As a clean eater, hair in my salad disgusts me. I come to flowerchild knowing that I will get a quality meal with clean and well prepared ingredients, yet there was a hair in my food. I walked back up to the ordering station and was met with a waiter asking me what was wrong, I showed him the hair and he showed no remorse. The waiter then gave it back to my waitress who had originally given me the salad, who then showed the woman chef behind the counter, whom had no hairnet on. I noticed them both laugh at it. I made sure they made a whole new salad, and it was given to me with a simple sorry. The chef, manager, and waitress obviously did not care at all, and treated it pretty much as a joke right in front of me. This is the first time I have come to a restaurant and the chef or manager hasn't come out to apologize for someone's hair being in my food. I'm extremely disappointed as I considered flower child to be a sanitary place, but after today I realized that they do not take sanitation seriously. I recommend going to another flower child location or another restaurant as whole if you are someone who cares about sanitation, the preparation of your food, and overall good service.",

However, within one day of posting that review, the manager contacted me to apologize for the experience and ask for a re-do. I appreciate her reaching out and making an effort to make amends. She offered us free meals, but we went in again on our own to get an authentic experience. As always, the food was delicious. We got our food quickly, and everyone's meal was as expected.   My brother called in to order 3 meals for pick up on our way home from toddler gym class. When we got there, they somehow had sold our order to someone else. The cashier apologized, but insisted the person who bought it said my brother's name as his pickup name--hmmm.   They said it would be 5-10 minutes to cook the order. After we waited a bit longer than ten minutes (with a fussy toddler), they gave my brother the food. I figured they would at least offer a discount if not give the meals for free, but instead they threw in ONE free $3 brownie, when we had clearly ordered 3 separate meals. They were only mildly apologetic and just didn't seem to really care. It was disappointing.   That being said, the food (Thai bowl with chicken, curry bowl with chicken, and a wrap) was seriously delicious. I'll definitely come back since the food was really good, and I hope to be able to add some stars for great customer service.",

Also oredered the brussel sprout salad and added the sustainable salmon to it. It was delicious. I like salmon and this one was moist and flavorful. This place has a whimsical feel to it. There's a relaxed vibe and the music is loud enough to hear but mellow enough to still be able to hear the person your sitting next to. I will definitely be coming back!",

Can't go wrong with any of their salads -- the Skinny Cobb is my favorite. It's a bit pricy to add my favorite protein (steak) but it's always delicious.

This is Flower Child's third location. They promote healthy eating and divide their menu among salads, vegetable bowls and wraps. I got the Mother Earth Bowl - a mix of grains, sweet potato, avocado, broccoli pesto and leafy greens. It's a popular choice and had lots of flavor (and I didn't add any protein). The decor of this place is beautiful and definitely a great place to stop in for lunch or early dinner.",

I love the GF mac and cheese - it was really rich and tasty, which I didn't expect from a gluten-free dish. The wild mushroom pho was a bit of a letdown for me, maybe because I love the traditional pho served in Vietnamese restaurants and the vegan version in Flower Child had no similarity to traditional pho, save for the fresh herbs and bean sprouts served on the side.

When we arrived, we were able to get right up to the counter to order (no wait service here, although they deliver it to your table once your food is ready). Shortly after receiving our food though, the line was out the door, so get here early or not at peak times.  The food was delivered quickly and looked beautiful. My sis and I split a couple of the dishes, including the Thai Dye wrap and a winter salad with added tofu. Both had great flavor, and I definitely recommend adding the tofu to the salad for some added protein. The tofu had a great smoky flavor, so it wasn't just your run-of-the-mill tofu. I love all of the great vegetarian options!!!!  Price was a bit high for lunch, and we left without leftovers, but for the quality and flavor of food I'd say it's worth it.",

Also ordered the eggplant and potatoes to share with a friend. The flavor is amazing! The price is decent and the Decour could not be any more adorable. I seriously want my house decorated the way this restaurant is. Even the tile work is amazing they thought of every little detail to make this seem like a cozy little restaurant. They beverages they offer are also fresh made and super delicious. I got the passion fruit lemonade and it was amazing. For my refill I got some of the tea varieties that they have and that was also very good. I will definitely go back to this restaurant on my next visit to this area of Arizona.",

I found the prices to be on the higher end, especially for 2 servings (granted large portions) of veggies. But I was in the mood for just that and wasn't disappointed with the taste or the portion.

We took our family out for dinner at the location on Camelback, near my son's school.  We were all wowed! Flower Child's chef cleverly enhances fresh cooked vegetables by playing with complementary flavors and textures that wow the palate. They have both meat, vegetarian and vegan options.  We are in love with Saturday and Sunday breakfast from 9-11 am. The family favorite is the exciting vegan hash that has bold and bright flavors. We were amazed that firm tofu is transformed to a chewy chorizo sort of texture and flavor. It is sauteed with kale, onions, sweet potato and thinly slice organic potatoes served up with a dollop of avocado hummus that has a tangy kick. The combination is magical. The subtler Turkey Scramble is mellower with rich flavors. We were dubious about the Dijon mustard and maple syrup, but they are masterfully amalgamated into the dish together with organic potatoes, turkey, sweet potatoes, eggs and smoked Gouda. Simply sublime!  I enjoy sipping my homemade flavored Kombucha with the meal. They also offer interesting flavored black tea, green tea and lemonades. At Flower Child, the food looks and tastes terrific, making your body feel fabulous, too!",

Fortunately I do not have any special needs so I got the 2 veggie/1 Protein plate...ended up adding another veggie. Everything is top notch. I have to admit that while everything was delicious, the most amazing was the watermelon-tomato caprese type vegetable dish...it was remarkable and had so much flavor.

    "text": "I really don't understand all the hype surrounding Flower Child. I've been to locations in Las Vegas, Austin and Phoenix, and have left feeling ripped off and underwhelmed each and every time. The concept is great--offer fresh, healthy meals catering to a variety of diets. The execution of the dishes is what's lacking. I've found the food to be too oily and over-seasoned (yet somehow lacking flavor), and the portions too small. Sure, you can add protein for $4+, but that's sheer madness for a fast-casual restaurant with small portions. My fiance and I had lunch with no beverages and the total was $25. I ended up giving him some of my food because he didn't have nearly enough.  Several other things about this afternoon's visit bothered me given the prices charged by this restaurant, in addition to the wannabe healthy, hippy, eco-friendly vibes. First, the tables were filthy. Even after we wiped down our table and flagged an employee down to have them wipe the table with a wet cloth, we were left with smeared sauces and other dried-on crud from previous patrons. Second, cups for water and other beverages are all single-use and incredibly wasteful. Unless taking food to-go, glassware should be offered as its much more sustainable. Lastly, I've had a horrible stomachache and headache since lunch, which tells me the food I was informed was gluten-free was not truly free from contamination. All in all, this visit will probably be my last for quite some time. There are far too many better options that cost less and provide a better experience.",

Not only is it more expensive (supposedly bigger portions), now on the kids menu you can't chose any option unless it's listed on there. This isn't fair to me because only one item is vegan, and it's apples. I do not want apples for dinner.  Also, my boyfriend likes steak medium rare, Mac and cheese, sweet corn quinoa and the broccoli. Well now it's $9 for two sides, $6 for the steak and then $4 for an extra side. So for $19 you're getting a meal that you'll probably still be left hungry after. Also, they cannot ever seem to cook his steak medium rare and every time we come here we have to send it back to get remade. And then we got to go this past week and the steak was completely grey, so obviously once again not medium rare.   I say skip this location and drive 15 more min to the 44st and camelback location. More menu items, better prices and they actually cook your meal how you order it.",

This place, just from the menu, had everything we needed: vegan noms, and meaty options for the Brother in Law.   Sitting a few blocks away in the parking lot of Dark Hall, I called in an order to Flower Child: 2 Thai Dye wraps, and 2 Turkey Avocado wraps.  When arriving at Flower Child, just from the outside, this place is GORGEOUS. There are plants everywhere, and the color scheme and set up looked like something one would find in Portland. When we entered the building, I was even more in love. The interior design is awesome. It's eclectic, spacious, the decor is adorable, the interior color scheme pairs well with the exterior, and oh my god It's cute. I was honestly shocked to find out Flower Child is a restaurant chain.   All that being said, this place is definitely pricey. It was slightly under $50 for four of us to dine: a delicious wrap with a small side salad. BUT my Thai Dye wrap was so delicious! The wrap/pita that's used is extremely tasty, and the filling: a thai mix with veggies, thai basil, tofu, and yummy sauce, was delectable.  Everything tasted fresh, and was definitely clean, healthy eating. I know if I lived in an area with a Flower Child, I would definitely be visiting often, trying all the plant-based options I could!",

    "text": "If I can ignore prices, I would probably give this place 5 stars.   Flower Child is situated in a adorable shopping center with other great eats and plenty of parking. There is a different line for to-go orders to the left side of the main ordering area.   Boyfriend and I ordered Mother Earth Bowls (one with steak and the other with tofu) and pretty much scarfed down our food instantly when we got back to the hotel.   We were in the area for a Muay Thai competition and needed food that was going to be satisfying and still nutritious. Flower Child was perfect for this. Everything in the bowl were so well-cooked and seasoned. The steak was super tender to even cut with plastic cutlery and tofu was seasoned well and not left bland.   My only gripe is the price on the bowls just to add the proteins were a little bit over my budget. For both bowls, they were about $30. If you're more expensive that a Chipotle bowl with guac and chips, it's likely out of price range lol. But since we were hotel chilling with no kitchen, it was a great choice for variety and nutrition.   If I'm back in Arizona for another tournament, I would still consider coming back and maybe trying a not as expensive bowl.",

Flower child is the affordable fast casual relative of True Foods. It delivers up delicious vegetables that you can group together for a healthy meal. Think heirloom tomato and watermelon salads, turmeric and curried cauliflower paired with protein (antibiotic free chicken or grass fed steak) or sustainable salmon. Also, I love their fresh juices.   The space is lovely- and very excited that they are in North CenPho!",

I have been a big fan of his big name locations (Culinary Dropout, The Arrogant butcher, the Henry) and even worked at one of his locations as a food runner/ Barback. Each location, no matter the restaurant, has its own feel to it. Each different from one another.. So I had high hopes for Flower Child. Not only has it been listed as an up and coming restaurant, Fox has mastered the Trendy/healthy vibe: atmosphere we find in Flower Child. Unfortunately, this place was a little too trendy for my liking.   From the moment we walked in, We got the impression we weren't cool enough to be there., we still needed a moment to look through the menu. The glaring continued the entire time.   Our first impression of the cashier was friendly. He politely asked if there was anything he could help with and we told him no. He then told us he had fi run to the back to grab something and when he came back it was a completely different scenario. His personality changed. Almost as if he was suddenly counting down the minutes he had left to work. Did not seem happy at all. We placed our order and found a table.   I ordered the protein bowl and my girlfriend ordered a wrap. For dessert we ordered a big chocolate chip cookie which was probably the best part of the entire meal. The protein bowl was good. I was under the impression it was a rice bowl. It wasn't. It had quinoa and some other grainy replacement. If I was into that type of cuisine I probably would have liked it more. But I didn't know what I was eating snd didn't get much assistance as to what we could order. It was clear that we didn't know what were were doing. Some direction in a situation like that helps. \"You guys look a little lost, any questions?\" Or \"have you been here before? Awesome! Welcome! Most newbies Grab this....\" something. Anything would have been nice. But because we were clueless and had no preference, we each picked an item at random. As we walked to  our table, the line cooks continued to glare as if they hadn't seen anyone walk through the doors in hours. It was weird. I would have to say the service was just off. The entire time we felt like we're being Judged from the moment we walked in. As I said,  I used to work in the industry and my girl still does. Whether you're in the industry or not, it's not polite to stare. Weird vibes. Good food. Good menu. Bad service. Arrogant and pompous. We likely won't be back to this location until we're cool enough to know the difference between quinoa and cous cous",

The sweet/spicy sweet potatoes, eggplant, and cauliflower were awesome.  There were three of us and we all loved it.  The ambience was fun and comfortable. Things were clean and service was friendly and helpful. The only minor thing is while the drinks/ice teas were good and fresh, they lacked a little punch.  The tea with rose did not have much rose and the same with the passion fruit one. All and all was great and looking forward to returning on another visit to Phoenix.",

Food also good with a sold selections of healthy options and the ability to customize your plate the way you like it. Anywhere from macaroni and cheese to eggplants. A Sold selections of Vegan people.   I had a plate with 3 sides, Smashed Organic Potato, Spicy Japanese Eggplant, and Gluten-Free Mac & Cheese with chicken. This companion of different flavors on my plate was amazing. I felt like I was getting little of everything. The plate was big enough to fill most people without a problem, yet I found the cost of adding chicken was little on the expensive side($5 extra).  The line can get longer than I'd like specially when it's lunch hours, I also experienced a very long delay in one of my side orders, and no one even acknowledge the delay.    All in all, I would be coming back to try new flavorful dishes as soon as I get a chance. I thought the miner problem I had with my experience was not a common problem and I just happened to be that person.",

Just never expected cinnamon to be put on traditional vietnamese noodle dish.  Anyway, the manager happened to be walking around and asked if I like my meal. I told him I wasnt expecting cinnamon but it was my fault I didnt read the menu closely. He insisted on getting me something else (Never asked for it or insinuate I need to be compensated). That initiative is pretty rare. Anyway he got me a wrap instead and it was yummy.  I came back after that and tried different things. My favorite is the indian spiced cauliflower. Seriously that stuff was BOMB.  I would rate this place 4.5. .5 because some of the people back at the register can be unfriendly/rude. Gave you attitude too which in its own way I found quite entertaining. I never had issue with the servers however. They were friendly and appeared accomodating.  Would like to note though, the ones handling the cash register is generally the first point of contact a new customer will meet. If they experience a poor treatment here and decided the rest of experience suck from that one intetaction, you are likely to lose new customer and whoever else they would have bring next time.",

I ordered the Mother Earth bowl and it came with chicken, pesto, avocado. sweet potato, quinoa, greens, onions, and cucumber. In my opinion, I think there was too much quinoa. There should be a little less of that and maybe more vegetables or even pesto, since there was barely any of that. I don't know if that's a personal preference or an actual portion issue lol the chicken was tender and juicy. The pesto was savory. The cucumber added a much needed freshness and cooking sensation to the plate. The sweet potato les were, to my surprise, \"spicier\" than I expected! It was a nice surprise. Not spicy to me but it had a nice little flavor kick. For personal preference, I would say no onion. They have fresh lemonades and teas. They're delicious. I think I would return here!

While the food is delicious, it's being served lukewarm, like under 120 degrees lately. Someone could easily get sick when food is left between 41-140 degrees.  I have notified staff and the assistant general manager of this multiple times now without seeing any improvements. On several occasions, I even requested that cashier tell the kitchen to make sure my food is hot. And yet, my requests were ignored despite even tipping them. Despite my complaints to staff and management, they have never once even offered to comp my food.   I get the impression the staff does not care. Flower Child is a high-priced fast food chain. Healthy food begins with food safety! There's no point to eating healthy food that you're likely to get sick from. There are plenty of other healthy, safer, and even less expensive options in this area.",

We get our food in like 10 minutes after ordering. Sometimes there's a long line when we get there but it moves very quickly. My favorite things are: lemon olive oil muffin, chocolate chip cookie, flying avocado wrap (surprisingly good flavor), and the sides steak, smashed potatoes, corn, Mac n cheese. The rebel wrap is really good too, but only if you're a fan of horseradish!",

I disliked the taste and I probably won't finish it. And I do not plan another visit. Plus I wasted 13 dollars on that pricey inferior wrap.

I was excited to try the forbidden rice bowl, which has no nuts listed in the ingredients. I have a nut allergy.  The minute I took my first bite, I had an allergic reaction that I can only attribute to nuts.  After walking back up with the bowl, a manager was called up and I was asked if I would like something else.  I opted for the rebel wrap, which I've had before.  When it was brought out, the manager did share that they had coached the kitchen staff on cross-contamination and offered to show me the ingredients.  Excellent customer service, however, would have been to either comp the meal or, at minimum, offer to refund the difference in price between the two meals.  None of those happened.  Not sure if I will be back.",

We decided to head right over that day and was very happy we did.  My brain imagined a sit down restaurant with servers but when I walked in I was surprised by the set up. I wasn't disappointed by any means just not expecting a walk up counter with serve yourself beverages.  Flower Child deserves 5 stars because of the food, why I gave it 4 was because of the price. I ordered The Mother Earth (delicious by the way, complex flavors but simple foods) and I didn't add a protein just ate as is. I added the simple hummus and an iced tea and paid $21. For lunch. That's insane. I went back a couple days later and got the Mushroom Pho added tofu and had an iced tea and paid $17.   I just can't bring myself to pay that much money again on lunch. If I was rolling in the dough, I'd say forget it bring on the steak! But for a girl just trying to pay the bills this will be a splurge lunch.  Delicious however, and totally worth it if it's in your price range.",

This location is great and parking is much more convenient than the 40th Street location! YEAH!!",

Just the right sized portion and kept me full with all the good veggies inside. The restaurant itself was super clean and had a trendy vibe. Also had lots of delicious vegan options, clearly marked on the menu! Wish they had these in Canada so I could visit more often!",

I ordered the minestrone with kale & quinoa. Excellent!! I also ordered the masala curry bowl with tofu. Excellent!! I don't usually like raisins mixed in with my food but the sweetness complimented the dish very well.   My husband ordered the chicken coconut soup. I don't eat meat so I didn't taste it, but he liked it. He ordered a Thai, quinoa bowl with steak. Fortunately the steak didn't touch everything so I was able to taste it. Yum!!! I'll get that dish next time.  2 soups, 2 entrees with protein added and 1 lemonade=$46.   The staff was attentive and friendly. The customer base was a nice mix. This place reminded me of True Food minus all the \"pretty people.\" There are a lot of items I want to try so I will be back.",

Or, they have decided to increase the wrap price altogether while cutting the meal size in half. To spend 30 bucks on two sad little wraps with a couple whisps of lettuce when I used to get the EXACT same thing and it came with a substantial salad and a wrap I got 2 meals out of (dinner & lunch the next day) just another reminder why I don't go to Fox restaurants anymore. They do an impressive job up front, and then quality/quantity goes to hell once a location is established. So bummed out- this place was good (for dine in, take out portions have always been a joke) but I'm doooone. Done.",

    "text": "Flower Child made for an overall great dining experience. The food was delicious, and definitely met my expectations. The service was very warm and friendly. I especially loved theme of nature and happiness represented in the aesthetic of the restaurant. It made for a great mood during the meal.         When I first approached the restaurant, I found that the overall look was incredibly welcoming. The outside of the restaurant was beautifully decorated with wall art, and the cute lemonade stand right outside the door put a smile on my face. I waited in a generally short line to place my order. Placing my order was surprisingly smooth. The employee was able to take my friends order as well and my own under the same table number and at the same time. She was also still able to separate our checks. I ordered a side of their gluten free mac n cheese , their avocado/egg-white toast, as well as a drink. I was excited to try their healthy dishes. The food was a little more on the expensive side, but I hoped that the taste would make up for the emptiness in my pockets. The employee offered us our table indicator and allowed us to choose our table either inside or outside. We got our drinks from the selection of lemonades and teas. I decided on the Rose Petal Lemonade. It was delicious and I took advantage of the free refills! My friend and I decided to have a seat outside, which was nice, but the traffic on the busy street next to us was a little distracting to our conversation. Our food came out surprisingly quick, and was fantastic. The meal definitely rose above my expectations. I enjoyed the food so much, it was difficult to believe how healthy it was! The mac n cheese was great and I could tell the cheese was of high quality. The avocado toast was also really fresh and tasty. I will definitely be ordering these menu items again! My friend and I continued to enjoy the aroma of the restaurant for a short time before heading out. Overall, I really enjoyed the service, food, and setting. I will definitely be back soon!",

Also have some simple understanding of the how the number and table system works. Location was good, clean and uplifting. Had the Udon noodles with chicken. Child had the chicken with smashed potatoes and mac & cheese. (Mac & cheese was a little \"off\" tasting). Not sure why they would bring a child a very hot plate?! Noodles for bowl of soup was a bit too hot as well. Could've used more chicken in it since you have to pay an additional fee for it. My bowl only had a few small pieces. Drink options good and plenty. Will try again. But overall, a good filling and healthy meal option.",

    "text": "I have been going to Flower Child for about two years now, and I used to absolutely love it. It was one of my favorite places to go when I felt like treating myself.   However, I have noticed in recent times, both the quality and quantity of the food has been falling at a steady rate.  I used to get the madras curry with a side of chicken (which is very pricey for what it is because protein is not included with the dish [$13.00 + $5.00 = $18.00 plus tax]) and it was great. The flavors were fantastic, the chicken was cooked nicely and it wasn't dry. However, recently I've noticed the side of protein (which COSTS $5.00 EXTRA) has been getting smaller and smaller in size. The last time I went, I only received 4 small slices of chicken. Unacceptable, considering it doesn't even come with the dish. Also, the dish has been served with barely any sauce recently too, which makes its pretty dry and unappetizing.  My brother used to come with me and he would order the kids meal, which was an amazing deal, because it used to come with a lot and it tasted delicious ($6.00). I noticed that the quality of the kids meal has gone down severely. My most recent visit has me shocked that this establishment would dare serve something as pitiful as they did. For reference, I am going to attach a picture of how the kids meal used to look (around 2 yrs ago) compared to how it looked tonight.   Note the lack of chicken and lack of Mac n Cheese in the most recent order (AND that was a double side of Mac n Cheese). The price has not gone down, so I don't see why the quality/quantity has to take a hit.   This is what happens when a company gets too comfortable with their success. It makes me feel that they no longer want to put any effort into gaining new customers or maintaining old ones.  Flower Child should be absolutely ashamed of themselves. I'm sad to say they have finally lost me as a customer.",

You can add tofu (very flavorful) or other proteins.  I heard people oohing and ahhing over the salmon.     The chefs cooked the food with some precision and even bring it out to people.

    "text": "I've had a positive experience recently at a sister restaurant called Doughbird. Since I was nearby and like the menu for Flower Child I thought I'd finally give them a try.  Flower Child is a casual health focused restaurant. They serve a variety of local produce in choices of salads, vegetable plates, bowls, wraps and more. There are add on Protein Options where meats are naturally raised and the Tofu is organic non-gmo.  There is a menu posted at the entrance and you order at the counter, grab a number, get your beverage and seat yourself in the comfortable farmhouse style dining room or the attractive patio.  I ordered the Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl with added Salmon ($16.) I note I do have a peeve when I go to restaurants when I don't get what was promised on the menu.....My bowl was missing three ingredients that were necessary for flavor. My bowl was missing the Thai Basil, Jalapenos and the Shiitake Mushrooms. My salmon was cooked reasonably well and it was a nice portion but I felt cheated since three ingredients were missing. My bowl was ok at best but tasted bland.  My husband tried the Grass Fed Steak Wrap called Rebel Wrap. ($13.) He said the wrap had very good flavors but the steak inside was very sparse and was chewy. He didn't care for the salad that was served on the side because it just tasted like it was just oil.  The Mix and Match Vegetable Plates sound amazing so we decided to share and try three vegetables.  Our favorite Vegetable that we tried the the Spicy Japanese Eggplant. It wasn't spicy but had tasty flavors and didn't seem oily like Asian Eggplant often is. Our least favorite vegetable was the Indian Spiced Cauliflower. It was mildly seasoned and seemed slightly Indian Style but what we didn't like most was the texture of the cauliflower. It was browned but was dry and sort of raw like.  On my way out someone asked me how things were. I did tell them about the missing ingredients from my bowl and they said that they were sorry and I left.  3 missing ingredients from my meal scant amount of chewy steak in wrap Order at the counter - Sit down service and priced type food.  The food in general was ok at best (OK on Yelp - 3 stars) But I don't believe it is ok to leave out three ingredients from something you order so I must award 2 stars.  I do figure my visit was an off day and normally they do things better but this is how it was on my visit.",

    "text": "Why does healthy have to be so expensive?  We came across Flower Child looking for a place for a lunch and ended up spending over $30 for two salads. They were two delicious salads but it they were still pricey. I had the kale salad with chicken. It was light and bright with the grapefruit and apples and my lunch date had the chopped salad. The highlight of lunch on this warm day was the lemonade. I could have drank that rose lemonade all day long until I floated away. The cucumber was tasty as well.  The restaurant itself was a comfortable casual and the staff was friendly. You order at the counter here and they give you a number and you can watch them work in the kitchen while you you wait for them to bring you your food. There is also outdoor seating.",

From the decor to the healthy food to the super fast service. This place is fast casual dining with tons of healthy options (organic wine and gluten free desserts to name a few) and fair pricing. They also have a great family take away option.   I've tried multiple dishes from their mix and match menu. I especially liked the sweet potato and green bean dishes. Also enjoyed the avocado hummus. Grab a glass of wine and relax on the cute, french-style patio!",

The kombucha on tap was delicious with just the right amount of bubble.

I stood in a long line to get my food and every person had received there food before myself. I couldn't even eat on the menu I was ordering for a friend. After not being able to eat from traveling all day you can imagine I am pretty hungry. Being on meds I get very sick the longer I go with out eating. I waited over 30 mins for a wrap and juice. After 12 mins waiting in line. Another 15 mins to get to another restaurant to get food I can actually eat. Watching the girls sit around talking to each other.",

They also served beer and wine. Win!  I had a skinny chopped salad and added salmon to it. My hunny had steak mac and cheese with side of broccoli. I had a wine and he had a water. The grand total was $45. It's definitely a bit overpriced but the way I justified it is that it's dine in restaurant quality food and price and a fast casual dining experience. The food was delicious! I'm on a strict diet and was surprised at how many options there were. Everyone that worked there was really friendly and our service was great.  The only other downside besides the price was that there were bones in my salmon. Beyond that it was an excellent experience.",

But after debating with my sister one day about where we should eat at for lunch, we decided to check this place out. First off, this place is huge. It has a very large inside eating area with doors that open up to a porch that has more seating + plenty of windows. There was a short line, we picked up a menu and both decided to order the Mother Earth bowl. They have a lot of vegan, vegetarian and meat options which was great. When we sat down, I couldn't help but glance at everyone's plates and see all the colors. I don't think I've ever seen a salad look so beautiful lol. We finally got our plates and I was excited! The presentation was amazing, and the different flavors worked together so perfectly. The bowl was very filling but after finishing, I didn't feel bloated or uncomfortably full! Instead, I felt super energized and content. Happy we checked this place out.",

The simple, yet tasty, menu of salads and bowls made from all-natural ingredients was a huge reminder that contrary to popular belief, healthy and delicious go hand-in-hand. I ordered the Mother Earth bowl, and never did I think I would so deeply enjoy a simple medley of roasted and raw veggies. It's left me with a resolve, stronger than any I've had for New Year's Resolutions past and present, to eat clean and eat green.  In addition to the incredible food, there were a million \"little things\" that made me smile. The restaurant is whimsically decorated with flowers, hand calligraphed signs, and rustic furniture. There's a small basket by the entrance for \"yoga mat parking\" and a sink right next to the dining area for easy hand-washing before eating. The entire atmosphere puts you at ease and I promise that it will do an unexpectedly good job of lifting your mood. As a San Francisco resident, I can't say I've found a salad place in my own health-obsessed city that can rival Flower Child!",

    "text": "Deciding to meet my girlfriend here was an easy choice since it is close to her college.  The parking lot was jammed packed at 12:30 due to the parking lot re-pavement.  However, we were not easily discouraged and kept circling.  MANY other people were doing the same thing and walking towards Flower Child.   Immediately upon entering the patio, Flower Child's casual trendy vibe was on  display.  Patrons were sitting in the beautiful Arizona autumn outdoors and inside the spacious restaurant.  Multiple workers greeted us and informed me of the ordering protocol.  ALL the workers appeared happy and were efficient.   The counter ordering style allowed fast service  which would be beneficial if we were on  a traditional lunch hour.   The vast menu was incredible.  From salads to wraps to bowls to desserts and ALL with interesting mixes of flavors.  We ordered at the counter, took seats outside and were served our lunch. We started with gluten free pumpkin muffins that were absolutely the most moist ever.  I had the Brussels Sprouts salad and my friend had beef with Brussels sprouts on the side.  The salad dressing was barely detectable which made every ingredient pop in my mouth (nuts, cheese, spinach, butternut squash).  It was as delicious as it was beautiful.  My friend's lunch was equally delicious by her gleeful face.  We managed to clean our plates in spite of our lively conversations.  The tea and lemonade bar had unusual flavors.  I enjoyed the pomegranate and ginger selection. I would highly recommend Flower Child to the patron who enjoys crisp flavors mixed creatively.  The menu is huge and I definitely need to return many more times to try more items.  The only thing I would change about my visit would be the music volume. It was such that I felt other customers and I needed to talk above a normal level to be heard.  Outside on the patio, music was not an issue.   Happy employees = Happy establishment = Happy Customers.",

    "text": "My first visit to Flower Child was in California and I liked it, so I decided to try it again while I was visiting Phoenix, which is where this concept was first launched. The menu is quite Californian, serving salad bowls, focusing on organic and sustainable produce, having vegan options, and adopting a farm to table approach. It appeared to be somewhere between an Urban Plates and Tender Greens based one appearance  For dinner, I had started off with a green curry cauliflower soup, followed by a Thai cashew quinoa bowl with grass-fed steak. I also added a side of turmeric cauliflower. The food here was definitely not on the bland side as I initially thought of a place that promotes \"health and wellness\". Everything I ordered was surprisingly very savory and slightly overly salty in my opinion. The soup was very flavorful, and tasted similar to the Thai green curry that you would pair with rice. It was loaded with ginger but balanced with the sweetness of the coconut. Unfortunately, due to the amount of coconut milk added, the soup itself was rather heavy. My appetite for the main course then dropped by 50%.  The Thai Cashew Quinoa Bowl with Grass-Fed Steak did not look anything like a Thai dish but it sure tasted similar to a Pad Kee Mao due to the seasonings used. Think of the rice noodles in that Thai stir fry substituted with quinoa, then mixed with a combination of the sweet soy sauce, fish sauce, and garlic flavor profile. There's also a hint of basil and charred onions. Very creative and tasty, but the strong salty taste became too heavy for me after a few bites. Not exactly a cleansing type of dish. I think I would have been better off sharing this bowl instead of finishing it by myself.  Then there was the turmeric cauliflower, which was solid but nothing special. Somewhat soggy, a bit overspiced in my opinion, better to eat it with something starchy to neutralize the saltiness.  Amongst the other fast-casual restaurants I know of that promote a healthy/vegan/organic lifestyle, Flower Child is probably the least health-conscious. The ingredients may be wholesome, but they were cooked with heavy hands of sauces, spices, and salt during my visit, not exactly what I expected.",

How wrong I was!!! I ordered the Thai Dye wrap (vegan) and my husband got the Madras Curry (vegetarian; I believe there was yogurt in the mix). Both options were NOT boring, instead they were very aromatic and delightful. Helpful hint, the curry needs to be stirred up to spread the sauce onto everything. Although the price is a bit high ($13 and $10) I still left feeling full and satiated. They also have beer and wine options so it's a nice place to go with a group, split some appetizers, and enjoy some beverages! The inside decor is cutsie-hipster and there is a lot of seating options (indoor and out) so it seems like a place where you can go with a larger group! I will be returning!",

Flower Power is in a perfect location to thrive, right at Camelback and Central in the middle of the action. the crowd here is biz professional and really good-looking soccer moms.  i've been here a few times and am impressed with the crowd management. this place, tho new, gets BIZ-ZAY, esp around lunch. the staff behind the counter, the food runners and managers are on-hand and do a really enviable job of running a busy location smoothly.  where Flower Power needs improvement is the food. ------a side of summer squash was only 25% squash ------a side of mac & cheese was cold and tiny, not warm and at least a healthy portion ------the flying avocado is OVER-seasoned with salt & pepper and Italian dressing ------the Thai wrap is OVER-sauced with the yum yet over-sugared dressing  the iced tea selection is respectable.  this may just be a Fox RC thing, or maybe just a young line cooks thing...but when you sell yourself as a \"healthy\" restaurant, and you sugar, salt and sauce your food to death, you are not healthy. you just have healthy marketing messaging.  Flower Power is a nice lunch option with a good location and pleasant service, but when i spend $15 or more/per person on lunch, i want to walk away feeling good about the quality of food i consumed...not guilty about how many calories i just ate because of the heavy hand of the line cooks. a little more modestly in your cooking would do you well, young cooks.  i think the health-conscious among us would be very happy with a healthier menu relying on fresh ingredients unhindered by salt/pepper slam dunks and sauce bazookas.  a good start Flower Power, but a ways to go...",

Their salads are a good size and you can add protein (steak, chicken, salmon, or tofu) for a few extra bucks. Their soups change daily and the 3 different ones I've had were unique and yummy. My husband always orders the forbidden rice bowl with steak and its great. The lemonade/tea and fresh baked goods are also noteworthy. They have a couple of local wines and beers on tap too.   Service is A+, decor is adorable, and seating is plentiful. The ONLY downfall is that for 2 of us we never get out of there spending less than $45-50.",

I ordered madras curry with tofu, and I was surprised that I had to pay an extra $4 for the tofu.  From my perspective, tofu should be the \"basic\" option with the choice of upgrading to chicken or steak for an extra cost.  I don't mind splurging on good food, but the amount of food served was also lacking such that I cannot justify spending ~$13 for a meal that barely made a dent in my stomach.  I walked out feeling \"healthy\" but also very unsatisfied and still very much hungry.  For the average eater who wants good food and is financially conscious, this place may not be a good regular spot.",
