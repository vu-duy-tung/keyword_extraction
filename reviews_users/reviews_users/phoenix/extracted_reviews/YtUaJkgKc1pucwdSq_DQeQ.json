    "text": "I started going to TeePee in 1972 and, having moved away many, many years ago, when I visit Phoenix, I alway go back and, while others may complain about the decor, I get to step back in time. I used to go there for lunch while in high school. I loved the hamburger for 55 cents at the time. If you have a HUGE appetite, order the nachos.  I love the hot sauce in the ketchup bottle. I decided I wanted to have some sent to my house. $60 shipping and it wasn't the same so it must be a \"walk down memory lane\" thing. I still love it when I eat there. The margaritas are great. Ever since GW was a customer there, I do stay as far away from that booth as I can. I'd lose my appetite if I had to look at his picture (really, the only negative but what are the owners going to do? Say no? Kick him out?)  I hope they keep the same decor. It wouldn't be the same if it were to be redecorated.  My spouse, who did not grow up in Phoenix, likes the food. We always stay at the Phoenician but dine, at least once, at Tee Pee.",

Tee Pee has been around for a long time and has hosted some pretty famous people, including George W. Bush (put all politics aside, if the the President of The United States has visited a restaurant, I think you should try it). Make sure you go hungry - the portions are HUGE, even by American standards. Chips and salsa are standard when you sit and the salsa is good & hot (but not too hot). The booths are old & cosy, the room loud with folks of all ages have a grand time, the margaritas are best poured from a pitcher and the food is authentic, old-school Mexican.",

The salsa tasted like straight caned tomato sauce, and a tortilla with just some chicken thrown in it is not a burrito! And the greatest sin of all is the margaritas came is some weird little snifter glass (maybe 8oz), and had the undeniable flavor of powdered mix. YUCK! There are far better places to go in the Valley for good low-end mexican food. Los Betos even destroys this place! Do not believe the the hype! Do yourself a favor and miss this one.",

One top of three pieces of inadequately spicy chilies was this gigantic eggwhite puff and the plate otherwise was coated with cheese.  The eggwhite did not really complement the chilies.  Would not order this again.   My wife's order of taco was also filled with too much cheese.

I had the green corn tamales with beans and rice and thought it was very good. Fresh, well made, and tasty. Of course the Gold Margarita (with an extra shot on the side) may have influenced my taste buds.   Another reason for the extra star was the fast efficient service. We were a group of 7 and everything went smoothly. Drinks and chips served quickly. All our meals arrived together so we could all start digging in without having to wait for the one delinquent taco platter!   Nice traditional Mexican dining experience. I'll be back.",

We arrived on time and proceeded to wait nearly 30 minutes before we were seated.  When they went to seat us they had us at 2 separate tables, one that seated 4 and another that seated 2.  I didn't want to make a scene so I asked if we could pull up a chair to the table of 4.  This was the best part of our visit.  We order our food pretty quickly and and about 20 minutes later our waiter said it would be a little while before our food was out.  We wait about another 15 minutes, no big deal.   When the food arrived it looked like mush.  My wife and I split a plate.  The Tamale was literally falling apart.  The only thing that appeared edible was the chile relleno.  The same with the food ordered by the kids.  Very disappointing.  I will no go back here again.",

It's not the best in town by a long shot, nor is it the worst. It's just a longtime hole-in-the-wall type of place that's been around for several generations of families who are used to its quirks. The bar room is a great, dark place to while away a hot day, and the tight orange-boothed dining room is straight out of 1960. Service is usually friendly and efficient, and many servers have been there for many years.   I see some reviewers on here complain about the food or atmosphere. I agree the atmosphere is a bit divey and food on many occasions leaves a lot to be desired in taste and quality. Yet I find myself going back over and over, as do lots and lots of other people. You know, maybe you just have to live in the area to \"get it?\"",

Not all of them, but certainly their stuffed chile rellenos and green chile dishes.   One of their boastful claims is how former President GHW Bush visited on at least one occasion, evidenced by their naming a menu item in his honor;  'The President's Plate'.  This leads me to wonder if Bush was laid-up the next day with a severe case of red-ass, and if that led to any world war-type events.  I know the day after my birthday celebration I was shittin' razor blades, and god help anyone who came in contact with me that day. So I can see where Bush might be all;  \"Oh yeah, Cheney? Well I'll show that piece o' shit Saddam what swift American justice looks like.  Someone get me a red button to push, STAT!!!

I ordered the carne asada chimi but part of me wonders if that's what I got.  I couldn't taste much of the spices, especially the cumin.  There were also some sauteed onions inside so part of me wonders if I got the fajita chimi on accident.  There just wasn't much taste to the meat which made the chimi average overall.  The rice looked fine, but it had a burnt taste to it.  Maybe something happened with the broth?  I love beans smothered in cheese but there just wasn't much taste to either of them.  After a few minutes on the plate it hardened up and needed to be cut into sections by a fork.  A couple of bright spots....  The salsa is good, both the regular and the hot.  They bring you a massive bowl of chips to snack on.  The waiter, I can't remember his name, was friendly and outgoing.  Also, I tend to like to overall feel of these kinds of places.  Not too fancy and looks old school.  One last thing....  I went there on a Saturday mid-afternoon and the bar section was completely hopping.  I'm not sure what that was about but my guess is that if you're looking for a place to put back a few on a Saturday then try Tee Pee.  I just can't recommend the food.",

I love spicy food and the salsa was spicy.  Too hot for my wife to really enjoy, but I loved it.  I usually add habanero to my salsa, but not here.  :)  Food did NOT come out super fast, that's because it's not pre-made and then nuked. (Sorry Drew) But it's great, we had super service and enjoyed the heck out of this place.  It's pretty close to Sky Harbor too.  Fortunately, we didn't know \"W\" ate there beforehand or we might have avoided it.  That being known now, I'd still go back.",

Although it was very busy, they got our party of 5 (with two toddlers) seated within 10 minutes.  The chips and salsa kept on coming and kept the kiddos happy.  My 4 yr old is a connoisseur of flavorful but not too spicy salsa, and Tee Pee's salsa fit the bill.  The chips were fresh, warm and crispy.  All in all a nice, reasonable dinner, great atmosphere and family friendly.  We'll be back again and again.",

Between the inattentive, uncaring servers and the definite need for the place to be powerwashed inside, I got the feeling that they assume that they will do fine without you or me. Really just a local dive bar that has too many TV's and serves food to some:  this joint needs to rethink their idea of restauranteurism.  I have eaten here twice (never let a bad experience go unpunished), so when I returned last week, I tried the chile relleno. Having eaten rellenos hundreds of places, the promise of a unique experience intrigued me. It was unique, all right!..... Two chiles laying on top of some cheap american cheese with a Baked Alaska top (eggs whites puffed up  and browned to look like a football) over the whole thing. This was not a relleno, It was a FUMBLE! Maybe the WORST relleno of my life.   Perhaps this is your kind of bar, which is why it got a second star from me, but it doesn't cut it as a restaurant, in my opinion. The photos they provide show a kitchen that seems a lot cleaner than where you eat............ maybe they should keep the food there.",

It's sort of Mod meets taco stand meets dive bar-- and I can't explain why that's a good combo but, imho, it is.  It's also dimly lit and the bar area is full of little Christmas lights that make for a great casual date.  However, that being said, I live close enough to order takeout whenever I've had that sort of bad day that needs Mexican food in decent quantities    The food: Albeit a little unhealthy and definitely Tex-mex rather than Mexican and pretty standard fare in that regard, this place is just ultimately satisfying.  Order the beef burro.  It's a must.  I don't think you can love this place as well if you don't.  The chile is perfect- I like the red and the green equally well, just depending on mood.  I'd second the opinions about the rice- it's really inexplicably good.  The chips, yeah, probably greasy but GOOD.  It's all greasy and good.  Don't eat here regularly- it will kill you.  Eat here when you need delicious, satisfying, comfort food and a pretty-cheap Dos Equis.    Service- I've always loved it but had one slow experience.  It's a hit and miss but I usually go during less-busy hours to avoid the crowds that can sometimes congregate.    The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that it's not really authentic Mexican, if that's what you're looking for and the dive vibe may turn some people off.  I personally love it.",

I was part of a party of 6, when we came in for the first time last night, having heard rave reviews and honestly excited to go this 'very good Mexican food' place and was completely let down by the end of the night. The overall experience was HORRIBLE! Our reservation was for 6pm but two people in our party got stuck in traffic and was late to the party. When we arrived the others had ordered and we quickly ordered from the menu. When ordering, the waiter could barely could understand my questions about the salsa and other menu items. Their mild is not a mild but more like a medium and they don't have any other milder options for you. The waiter was very rude when I asked him for something milder. Then when I was asking questions trying to decide between the two menu items, he acted as if I was inconveniencing by asking them, by asking them. We get our food and all eating having a good time talking and trying to hear in a busy restaurant. Let's just say if you a party of 4 of more you not be able to hear each across the table! Then comes the bill pay time, we all had to way 20 min for him to come back for us to check out! Then when we finally pay, we are just hanging out for another 5 min talking about stuff having a good time. The waiter comes back and stands at our table trying to get us to leave. He slowly keeps clearing the table, even finally taking our not done waters and saying to us \"ok, thank you for coming, have a good night, you can leave now\"   I'm sorry but that is simply NOT good business practice and now the next morning the food is making both of us sick to my stomach and throwing up.

    "text": "Phoenix is the home of a plethora of Mexican restaurants.   Tee Pee was recommended to me by the young lady who worked the front desk of my hotel.   She called the place a hole-in-the-wall joint but was positive that I would Love It!  She was partially correct!   I visited Tee Pee for lunch and was impressed with the vibe and feel of the restaurant. As you enter the walls are covered in autographed pictures of celebrities who have visited the joint, including former Presidents.   As a Buckeye seldom do I get to experience authentic Mexican including dining with locals. I heard one local proclaim - \"Hey Jose - You are Phoenix's best foreman\"  It was truly enjoyable and extremely authentic.  The lighting was dim but not uncomfortable.  The bar area included numerous TV's with your expected channels.  Sports and News.  They offer a small lunch menu and I ordered the Red / Green Enchillada and was served chips, salsa along with a bottle of some sort of spicy sauce as I waited.  The chips were cold and not at all flavorful.   The salsa was thick and delicious.   The red sauce had a distinct flavor but is hard to describe.  Overall - add a little salt, use the red sauce, eat the chips and don't complain because your expectations are high!    I also asked my waiter for a cup of queso to go with my chips.   I was told they did not have queso, just cheese.  I thought he was just a dull knife so I said okay \"whatever\".   Well - maybe I am the dull knife because the cheese did not arrive.    When my Enchilada arrived so did my cheese - melted all over the red and green sauce and burnt to a crisp.   My lunch was average at best or maybe it was authentic Mexican that this gringo just didn't understand.  None-the-less it was an average lunch but not a place I will return too.",

And then finally we are ready for the bill...we put our cards down, show him how to split it and 45 minutes later he shows  up with the bill.

One thing that very poignantly stands out is coming back to the Tee-Pee after coming back after living somewhere else for several years. What stands out is the memories of the food. When I left it was good, when I got back it was terrible.   The quality of the food has slid slowly into ho-hum-dom, and then further into what am I paying for? If you've read my profile, you'll notice that I'm HUGE on value. Does what you are getting measure up to what you are paying for? If I know I'm getting 5 Star food and service, I'll pay for it.   It just seems that things at the Tee-Pee have started to change from really being interested in putting out great food for a great price, to playing off the hype that has become the Arcadia neighborhood hotspot places.   It's most disappointing that what was once a favorite hangout, has left me finding other places to get good mexi-chow.",

So far we've tried the machaca taco, cheese enchilada, green chili burro and chicken burro. Everything including both salsas were lacking in flavor and the chips were stale, like last night's or last week's. Overall, the food tasted like something you'd get at a fast food joint like Taco Bell. Actually, Taco Bell is better.   The service was not so hot either. Neither time did they have our order ready when we arrived even though we had called ahead and been given a pick up time. We will definately NOT be going there again. BTW - we tried their famous chile relleno a few years back and were equally unimpressed. It was just a whole lot of whipped egg whites with a little green chili and ordinary cheese. The sauce was okay but not enough to try again. Don't bother going.",

Our waiter came by and we ordered \"4 margaritas please!\" He replied, \"want to get a pitcher of the GOOOD margaritas?!\" Unified, we replied, \"YES!\"  Well, two \"GOOOD\" pitchers later and we were drunk and ready for the check.  Albeit, the margaritas were really good, but they were not $42 per pitcher good!  Our drink total was $84 and definitely not worth it.  When we asked about the price our waiter said that they offered regular pitchers for $18 or the top shelf (or \"GOOOOD\") margaritas for $42.

My son and I ask for more tortillas (as they give you only 2) -- the waiter takes 5 min to bring out the wrong thing, then another 5 before he brings the right tortillas.  Food cold at this point.  They then proceed to charge for extra tortillas.  DON'T NICKEL AND DIME YOUR CUSTOMERS!!!  ESPECIALLY WHEN YOU SCREW UP.  GREAT, PRESIDENT BUSH ATE THERE, WE GET IT.  HE ALSO ATE AT A MILLION OTHER PLACES.  GET  YOUR ACT TOGETHER.",

He took the chips that we were picking at and put them into the fryer again....  gross and yuk! .. salsa is old and was setting on the table when we got there... as it was on every other table with no one there.

    "text": "Why does this place have so many 1 and 2 star reviews? I just don't understand. I have been coming here for YEARS. Even before I went the vegetarian/vegan route. I used to have birthday party dinners here when I was a kid. This place has always been my favorite Mexican place to eat at, and is always super crowded with people. You should have seen it the day after the Superbowl. It was a mad house! But because I love it so, we still waited the thirty minutes and ate here anyways.  The service is sort of touchy. Some times we get really good servers who are friendly, and other times we get the ones who just rush and take your order and don't bother to care about you at all. Really though, as long as the service is fast, I could care less about whether or not they talk to me. It is just nice when they do.   The food is always hot, and always comes out super fast. I always order a bean chimichunga with no cheese, no sour cream, and all beans on the side with no cheese. The lettuce and tomatoes they put all over every dish is slightly annoying and I always forget to ask for them to take it off, but whatever. I love my bean chimi.   Whoever comes here and expects to get 5 star Mexican food is kidding themselves. You can tell from the outside of this place that when you come in here, you are going to get some greasy bad for you Mexican food. And that is exactly why I frequent this place. When I am in the mood to just eat greasy food that's going to make me feel like I just ate 3000 calories, I come here. Because even being a vegetarian, you have to have a place where you go to eat bad for you food.",

I expected grease, I expected a lackluster interior, and I expected mediocre food.  I guess it met my expectations.  Because nothing is too good for my husband's wife, he chose the \"presidential\" table for us, complete with the \"hasn't been cleaned since 2004 presidential plaque.\"  Chips and salsa arrived promptly.  The chips were thin and crispy, but far too greasy.  The salsa was not the greatest either.  I ordered a chimichanga deciding it was going to be my last fat-laden meal for at least a month, or a week, whichever comes first, because I wanted the crispy tortilla.  Unfortunately, only the very ends of it were crispy.  The rest was drenched in sour cream and some pretty seriously bad gray-green guacamole which made the whole thing soggy.  What a sad waste of the deep-frying process.  Inside was green chile, made with beef, rather than my favored pork.  It wasn't too bad, but from what spilled out, I could see there was far too much grease in it.  Not that I was expecting healthy here, but this was ridiculous.  I almost didn't eat it, but I did.  Would I come back?  It's not at the top of my list, but if I say no, I'll end up there next week.  I did see they have pretty good drink specials, and the place was quite busy, so someone must like it more than I do.",

Oh yeah, eat the worm too so you're at least in a position to consume less of the steaming hot mess they bring out on a plate.  What'd you order again anyway?  That's right it all looks the same at this dump.  Melted piles of \"processed cheese food\", the whitest of shredded lettuce you can find and brown or dark brown meat.  Yummmm...  Chips and salsa, you say?  Man, I remember when Chi-Chi's hit my hometown and chips and salsa was something new.  Rewind the track to the 80s when they bring out the chips and salsa but leave the flavor behind.  Maybe that's where the jars of Chi-Chi's salsa went and this place even took the time to add water and wipe the salt off the chips.  Wow!  George W. Bush sat here?  The claim to fame is he ate here and his picture was on the wall near my booth.  The worst President of all time sat at my booth?  Did he make my enchiladas too?  I blame America that this place is still in business.  This place is terrible...  It's possible the sign should say Pete's which is another place to avoid.  I vote to widen Indian School to add two westbound lanes just to put this place out of business.  If you do visit, stop and get some T.P. on your way home.",

    "text": "If you want to know what the real core of Phoenix--and I am not talking about the extreme East LA suburb it's become in the last 15 years--is all about, you need to experience the Tee Pee.  The food is Mexican in the same way that Pat Boone singing \"Tutti Fruitti\" is rock n' roll or Justin Timberlake is an actor, but that's to be expected. TeePee offers you their take on the GringoMex genre and does it well, with mountains of cheese piled atop mildly spiced traditionals like enchiladas and hard tacos, complete with sides of refried beans and rice crusted over by spending a bit too much time under the salamander. The chips are obviously made in the restaurant because they are too greasy to have travelled far. You pay a bit more than would ordinarily seem appropriate for this level of cuisine, but then there's the show.  And the show--on weekend nights, at least--is a parade of dapper, vigorous men in their 50's and 60's who have the appearance of scratch golfers, or at least the clothes for it.  They are accompanied either by one of two types of women: Those about the same age who look like they spend a good bit of time at the hair salon and getting rhinestones custom-embedded into jeans that actually fit their butts, or younger ones with great make-up and pneumatic breasts. Together they float on a cloud of real-estate development money, ferried to the place in various standard-Scottsdale-issue Lexuses Acuras and BMW's. Jocular phrases are bandied about by the tanned multitudes: Trips to Hawaii, facelifts, scapegrace kids being sent to military schools.  And all of this happens in a building that probably started out as a private home at one point, has been added on to over the decades, and still features formica tabletops, painted concrete floors, and vinyl booths.  So go for the show. You can eat anywhere.",

What am I missing here? This food is not very good.  I guess if you like big portion's I do not), then that would be a positive note for this restaurant.    My companion and I ordered a few different menu items, including the Chile Relleno, a Chimichanga and beef taco.  Let us start with the beef taco.  The appearance actually looked good. Crispy taco shell with colorful lettuce, tomato and cheese all over and the beef was decently cooked.  Unfortunately, the bottom of the taco had broken apart from the amount of oil, which make it hard to eat, but not bad.  The chimichanga was huge and covered with what seemed like three different sauces, and way too much of all three.  The chimi itself was not crunchy and totally lacking in flavor, most of it went un eaten.    I left the Chile Relleno description till the end, because this was nothing short of funny.  I have had Chile Relleno around fifty times in my life, minimum.  Never, ever ever, have I seen a plate of Chile Relleno look like this. You need to picture a football sized shell of some white substance with a plate of melted cheese below it. Seriously, it was bizarre and complete disgusting, dish was left completely untouched.  I am unsure how the kitchen lets a dish leave looking like that, totally revolting.  Anyways, I am on my lonesome on this review, based on the fact there was an hour wait tonight on a Sunday and you cannot even get into the parking lot.  Go figure. I will not be back.",

The salsa had cucumbers in it. It was bland. The food tasted old- like it had be reheated 3 times and steam tabled for a while. It was hot but tasted old.  The beans on the tostada were tasteless. The beef in the taco was ridiculously salty. The quality of food was lesser than that of Taco Bell. Greasy.  Not sure why this is a favorite other than nostalgia. They need a menu reboot. Big time. The food just tastes like the cooks are bored. The recipes are tired. If you haven't been eating there since childhood- don't start now. The wait staff is nice. Food came out quickly. Those are the only positives.",

Not in a bad way, mind you, as it is clean and well preserved.  Service is always prompt, and they do a good job of keeping the chips/salsa refilled. On that note, chips are warm and salted just right, but the salsa rates a \"just okay\".  I really enjoy coming here for their cheese crisps and margs. Simple fare, I know, but it makes me happy.  The rest of their fare is decent, though I can't say i have a \"must have\" dish here, though I do enjoy their tacos and 'changas.  All in all, a solid place for Mexican food.  Cheers! RS",

Combination fajitas were really delicious - shrimp not overcooked and chicken tender and well seasoned. Cheese crisp was a great appetizer and the chili relleno was spectacular.   Weird that plates are all too hot to touch - really dangerous hot - afraid some of ours were in the oven for a long time.  Food wasn't worse for wear, but weird.  Space is cool, cosy cafeteria-style bankette seating and there's also a small outside patio. Overall this place looks pretty lived-in, but definitely worth a try.",

I just couldn't chew it anymore while thinking about what it was going to do to my insides. I felt like if I stuck some on my arm, it would be absorbed by my skin and instantly turned into fat and an artery clog.   Let me back up though - the parking lot is a crowded mess where you can pretty much assume your car is going to get dented by another car door. How about some wider spaces and one person has to park on the street? After that, you walk into a dark dungeon where a 9 month pregnant girl directs you through some sort of dark bar into some hideously decorated brighter room with booths stolen from an IHOP that burned down in the 80s.   The table and seats were filthy and greasy and if someone sits behind you, you share opposite sides of a seatback - which is a little too intimate for me...   The margaritas are small and not very powerful or particularly tasty or memorable. The food in general was pretty greasy. The chips and salsa were average. The prices were pretty steep considering what you're getting. The service was decent I suppose, but I felt like I was being served by scary grade school lunch ladies.   I won't be going back any time soon. I left more on my plate than I ate... I also left wanting to puke up what I did consume and start lunch over somewhere good. This food would've been appreciated a little more if the cost was about 1/3 of what it was. It still wouldn't have been good though.  This place seemed pretty authentic to me - it's not like authentic = good... Real Mexican food is shitty - cheap ingredients and too much grease and fat. It's an authentic shitty Mexican food restaurant. Go eat somewhere else.",

    "text": "I feel a bit guilty giving this place only 3 stars, due to the reason I visited the Tee Pee, but being an honest, good little yelper I can not tell a lie.  My Step Father recently passed away unexpectedly here in MD and we had to make a trip out to Chandler, AZ where he grew up, and had wished to be laid to rest. The Tee Pee was one of my Step Dad & my Mom's favorites places to come and eat while they were visiting. For years they would go on tubing trips down the river, and their favorite place to go afterwards was the Tee Pee. It was a tradition.   The atmosphere is definitely casual. It is laid back which I love. The patio is pretty cool, with the tv's and the misters. The owner was extremely considerate and was very, very nice. He gave our huge party complimentary cheese crisps  for every table, as he had heard what had happened, which I will give an extra star, because service does matter. The servers, bartender's, and the owner are all super friendly and pleasant.   The only issue I had with the place was the food. It was terrible. The famous cheese crisps are just a simple flour tortilla with melted cheese. The chips were stale, the salsa average. The guacamole was pretty good however. My brother and I split the chicken chimichanga. It was massive. It was a little too greasy for my taste. I have had better mexican food at chipotle. I don't really get what all the other reviewers are raving about, how Tee Pee serves authentic Mexican food, in my opinion it's simpy Tex Mex. I am from MD and I think I have had more authentic Mexican food in my home town. I thought I would be in for a treat being in AZ. So I was extremely disappointed in the food. Not a huge fan of the margarita's either, the only good thing about them was the salt.   Needless to say I was glad to experience a place that they had loved and enjoyed together. However I think they forgot to mention that they were always hammered after those all day tubing trips so I am sure the food was amazing after several cold beers, and the Arizona sun.",

    "text": "Viva Bush! (are we serious?)  A couple months ago I was reading a SkyMail magazine (I should have known) on my way home from a business trip when I came across a section about Phoenix. In there they lauded the traditional staple, Tee Pee. As an avid a&e girl, I made a note and told myself I'd give it a try sometime soon.  I had some friends in town from out east. On their last night they asked to eat mex food one last time before they headed back (I had taken them to Barrio and a few other clutch spots prior to this).  I was trying to think of some place i hadn't been and the Tee Pee review came to mind.   Vamos   The place looks ok enough. Parking was tight but doable. As I entered, I was immediately greeted by two prominently displayed bumper stickers reading Viva Bush! Upon further inspection, I discovered that this was due to W's trip to the restaurant while in the Valley in 04. Woo hoo. I picked up on their sycophant theme with celeb pics from brad in tool time to larry bird...i guess I can't blame them too much...they appear to be very open about the dire need for a little et-esque action.   To preface I have to be honest -- I'm a guac and marg snob. I could live off of them both and thus my reviews tend to get really jaded when either aren't up to par. So, we each had margaritas...weak, mixy tasting, and small. Guac again was weak (not very flavorful), mixy-processed tasting, and small. Not a complete failure...definitely edible...just nothing special.   For my entree, I had the fish tacos which were drenched in grease and barely had anything in them.  But the fish was grilled or broiled (I'm not sure) and not breaded, which was a definite plus. Others ordered a guac tostada, which apparently was decent but not superb. My veg friend ordered the veg plate which was beans, calabistas, and rice. Again, decent nothing too impressive.  So 3 stars because the food was definitely ok and worth eating. But it's not anywhere near authentic, original, or flavorful.   So if you want some American-Mex that screams Viva Bush...this is your spot!",

I've never had a bad margarita there.  here's a cautionary:  the Chile Relleno is unlike any you've ever experienced before.  you may not like it if you expect a typical relleno.  it's a unique mutation that will have you wondering if the creator took too much acid in the 60s.  some people love 'em, some people hate 'em.  That's all I'm going to say about 'em..  I always sit in the bar (quieter) get the enchilada cheese and onions, crumble up some of the free chips into the sauce and practically lick the plate clean.  soak up the kitchy nostalgiaon the walls and in the orange naugahyde booths. delight in the old-school food.  But don't judge it by what it's not!",

The salsa is from a can and the food is always \"okay\" and I leave feeling gross and wondering \"why did I eat that?\"   I have no idea why this place gets so much credit.",

It is soggy, sloppy and tastes horrible. Today, I tried Manuel's down the street because I finally lost hope that Tee Pee would one day get it right. I ordered the same thing at Manuel's that I typically order at Tee Pee. The takeout was 100% better. Crisp, neat and tasted fantastic. I'd recommend Manuel's over Tee Pee if you're looking for good takeout.",

It was amusing to watch parties of six sit in side-by-side booths for four and two.  The BF and I got  the \"privilege\" of sitting at the George W. Bush table.  Putting lame duck politics aside, the food was pretty lame as well.   The chips were greasy and the salsa was bland.  The Albondigas Soup was the best part of the meal.  The meatballs were tasty (but sparse) and the chicken broth was nicely spicy.  The fajitas left much to be desired.  The beef and chicken were both over- cooked while the onions were nearly raw.  The portions were okay for lunch, but they would be lacking for dinner (and we didn't order off of a lunch menu).    This place has a downscale touristy vibe.  I watched a group of six take multiple pictures of themselves in the quirky booths and of the food.  Perhaps they want the pictures for an exhibit of what Mexican food looked like in the US in the 1950s.  Time has marched on from the Tee Pee.  For wallet-friendly Mexican, check out Mi Patio on 7th Avenue.  For gourmet Mexican, head over to Barrio Cafe on 16th Street.",

It was my first time at this restaurant and I had never heard of it so I was somewhat hesitant, but my trepidation was quickly pushed to the side. Apparently the owners have a relationship with the BS coach and did an exceptional job of taking care of all us. To my surprise, they provided us with plenty of free food and drinks, including some nachos that aren't even on the menu, in addition to taking pictures of us and giving us free t-shirts. They were extremely hospitable, the service was fantastic, and the good was great. I will definitely return and recommend others to check this place out.",

You can get a lot of different basic Mexican items, including the Arizona version of a burrito (called a \"burro\" here). Margaritas are a bit watered down and can be ordered by the plastic pitcher, but if you speak up they'll mix in a bit more liquor for you. One warning--the salsa is hot!

So naturally, I haven't had much luck finding any Mexican food that reminds me of home. However, of the many restaurants that I have tried here in the valley, this one has been the closest and the best...so far.  The dish that I got could've served two people but the idea was to try a variety . The tamale was very good and the cheese enchilada was surprisingly even better. And being someone who never raves about Mexican rice, it feels a little weird saying that their rice stole the show. It was very good. Overall I was happy with the quality and taste.   I dropped in for lunch on Sunday and it was packed. Luckily there was an open area at the bar, where they had NFL games on 3 or 4 tv's. The bartender was extremely attentive, never letting my coke sit half empty and refilling my chips bowl a couple times, as well. I will return!",

The food isn't that good for that long of a wait. That's just my opinion.   If you are hungry or have a big appetite then this is the place to go because you do get a lot of food.  Pres Bush ate here. boo.  I prefer Panchos on Baseline and Central (Clinton ate there =) ) and they give you large portions and it is way cheaper but much much much more tastier.

You can always tell when the place has good food before you even walk in.  The old musty smell of the long past cigarette smoke that still looms and the hard to find entrance to heaven.  Decor is the same as it was back when Bush supposedly came here to eat and the menu still has not adapted to integrate any sort of desert menu to increase profits.  That's ok.  Owners must be doing so well they just do what they like.    This is awesome for those old timers that want to keep the bar area a social gathering for over the hill drinker regulars.   As a suggestion, add some desserts to the menu and make it more of a family establishment.  The bar can stay separate of course.  But the food here is too good to limit to just old has been regulars.    Trust me when I say new generations will appreciate the delicious food served here and the ambience.    Get desserts!!

Specific Items that I was extremely disappointed with were the tacos (taco shells should definitely be more authentic tasting not taste store bought), rice was under cooked and not sure what the seasoning was but is was no Spanish or hispanic style rice. Enchiladas were sauceless and we're just cover with cheese (Most of the plate was). Tortillas were very flour tasting not corn. Salsa tasted like pace picante hot salsa.

    "text": "A shiny and sleek interior, an innovative and locally sourced menu, all brought to you by a celebrity chef is everything Tee Pee Mexican Restaurant is not. Instead you get a divey old building, vinyl booths, a ceiling adorned with Christmas tree lights and an old school Tex-Mex menu that's simple, satisfying and inexpensive.  Each table is automatically adorned with a pitcher of ice water and a squirt bottle filled with Tee Pee's own hot sauce. Within moments of being sat into one of the comfy old vinyl booths a large bowl of chips is brought out and accompanied chunky salsa. The chips are humongous, essentially a medium corn tortilla cut in half and deep fried to till crisp. I just wish that on my last visit the humidity from the rain hadn't made the chips more chewy than crunchy. The chunky salsa was bursting with freshness and a slight throat burn more indicative to pepper than chile. Either way, I love built in appetizers.  I'm a cheese crisp fanatic, almost as much as I frenzy over good chicken wings. So I consider myself an expert by way of sheer cheese crisp volume consumed over the course of my lifetime. Having chowed on so many, there have been many great and not great, the later being a greasy flaccid disappointment. So what's great about the Green Chili Strips Cheese Crisp ($6.75) from Tee Pee? The truth in advertising. Pick up a slice and you'll find its truly crisp and rigid being followed by thick ropes of gooey melted cheddar cheese.    Green, smooth and easy to spread, the Guacamole Dip ($5.50) while good was lacking any discernible heat. After all we're at a Mexican food restaurant and shouldn't we deserve a little bit of heat? Next time Ill ask if they can make it spicy.   The Beef Fajita Chimichanga ($11.25) is an ode to everything that is right about fried food. Huge flour tortilla filled with tender well seasoned grilled beef, onions and bell peppers, then rolled and deep fried to delicate crunch. The French fried burrito is covered with the usual suspects including red sauce, lettuce, tomato, cheese, sour cream and a healthy dollop of guacamole. I didn't feel an ounce of guilt eating the entire thing.  What's good Mexican food without a mainstay like Sour Cream Enchiladas ($8.00)? Corn tortillas encircle molten cheddar cheese and sour cream then draped with Tee Pee's savory red sauce. As soon as the plate arrived I could tell that these were going to be good. Oh, by the way, when they say these plates are hot, they aren't kidding. Seriously, do no touch these or you will get burnt, I speak from experience on this one, heed their warning. However, the fieriness from the plate further enhanced the slightly smoky red chile sauce, making it that much more tangy and delicious. Both entrees were served with moist fluffy rice and thick cheesy refried beans.   Show up in shorts and t-shirt, I don't think you can ever be undressed at Tee Pee but that's all part of the charm. Come as your are, even if you get enchilada sauce all over your shirt, no worries, pre-treating will take it right out.",

A very small amount of average margarita mix. The salsa they initially brought us was bland. Really the whole meal lacked flavor. The service was okay, although our waiter forgot our guacamole. He brought it after we asked for it again. It ended up being the best thing about our dinner. Overall this place needs to kick it up a notch.",

We did have to wait a bit due to the time it takes to make the Chile Relleno.    As far as the food, I enjoyed the Mexican Pizza-not only was it huge, it was very tasty.  I did not try the Chile Relleno-not my thing- but the other person enjoyed it as well.  It was incredibly large-it was easily larger than a football.  I will probably go back at some point.

The El Presidential Especiale is a MUST - i order 86 the onions and add machaca/shredded beef. They are a simple yummy combination with their rice and beans. This is just straight up classic mexican food - not for the snobby. So if you want a more classy joint that's less authentic - hit up Z'Tejas cause this place is not for you. The hot salsa in the ketchup bottles is always a sign of a great mexican joint (and it's hot AND tastey - a combination not many get correct). I will say their chips can be a little on the less crunchy, more oily side but they are more than happy to replace that with some that are a little more to your liking. And their margs are delish as well. This place deserves a 4 because of consistency, friendly and accomodating atmosphere and just downright solid take on enchiladas - red sauce is spot on. Thanks Tee Pee for being our go-to for Mexican food in the Valley of the Sun!",

For water refills forget it because its not alcohol. Also discouraged after witnessing customers he knew being served before our simple and forgotten request. After being delivered cold nachos, no salsa, no water and ignored the waiter then stood by table waiting on a tip. Eek! Methinks not.",

The food was well made and the sauces were delicious!  I love the feel of the restaurant as well.  It's been around for awhile and Tee Pee does a great job of embracing its history.  The only way to make it better for my husband and I was to have a few spicy dishes on the menu.  We love spice and there wasn't anything to order to satisfy that on the menu but overall we enjoyed it!",

Let's be clear, Tee Pee is a dive with good ol' greasy Mexican food, so the 5 stars are based on my love and dedication to this amazing family-owned biz!   We typically meet my dad here on Saturdays around noon for sports, beer, and lunch! We always sit at the bar and have quick + attentive service! I LOVE their chips and salsa. I ALWAYS get a small cheese crisp + guac and Albondigas soup! It is like a Mexican meatball soup. I'm crazy and even order it in the summertime when it is 115 degrees outside. BUT, the dark and cool atmosphere of Tee Pee makes you forget all about the hot sunshine outside.   I know that we'll be back again soon! Thanks for holding a special place in my heart, Tee Pee!!",

The place is chopped up with little spaces every where. looks like 2 maybe 3 patios, but they are completely unused and they look like they have been ignored since April. Enter into a weird space and check in, go through a little opening into a bar, and past that through another 3 foot doorway and find the dining room. The place is very busy so I was shocked to find the smallest restaurant bathroom  ever. In todays world of new sleek uncluttered shinny new restaurants The Tee Pee is just the opposite. Stuff everywhere!!!  I didn't stop in because I wanted a $7 octopus taco and $15 dollar blue margarita I came because I craved good ole Mexican food, you know the kind with shredded lettuce and grated cheese on everything, and the plates so hot you cant touch them and you get warned twice!!!!  BINGO!!! This place is all that and more. It's just like I remember and I haven't been here in 2 decades.  We sat at the bar because on a Friday night there was a wait, and the bar was almost empty, and we like the bar.  Service was swift and super friendly, cold beers on tap, and best of all full service. did I mention the bartender was super friendly, she was!!!.  Dinners arrive and just what I was craving, I had the Tee Pee Special, beef taco, bean tostada and cheese & onion enchilada with rice and beans, It came with plenty of shredded lettuce and grated cheese, and I was warned twice the plate was too hot to touch. My Brothers Fajitas looked a little lack luster, not sizzling and on a regular plate but my brother really liked them. We both liked the ultra fresh chips and salsa, Cold beers and great tea, and for $40.00 plus tip we left completely stuffed and satisfied.  On our way out there was still a wait, friendly thank you's and good bye's and a basket of those starlight mints! There are not enough places like this, but I am sure this place will be around for some time to come.  Old School Mexican food done right, give them a try!",

An institution in Phoenix I learned about it ironically enough from my company's VP who is based in Dallas and every time she and her corporate entourage is in town we HAVE to go to Tee Pee it seems as soon as she arrives, it is her favorite.  Sure enough a big black Suburban will drop them off from their resort like clockwork!  Luckily there is plenty of parking including a spillover lot across the street.  President Bush evidently ate there and they named his meal after him, cheese enchiladas with onion I think, for the former leader of the free world he isn't very culinary adventurous. Nana's Chili Relleno is a favorite of everyone, forget what you know of Chili Relleno this one will shock you if you are not prepared, it is so big with so much egg it looks like your server put a roasted head of cauliflower on your plate it's really more of a souffle.  The Chilis are always very good with a solid flavor the egg coating however can vary.  Sometimes it has a good egg and batter flavor other times it's like a flavorless sponge.  The chips are always good as are the beans, the rice has come out slightly overcooked a few times but it wasn't bad.  A popular spot in Phoenix I like local institutions.",

I ordered the chicken enchilada, i figured you cant go wrong with that. As the server brought out the dishes for my coworkers, i noticed the rag that held the hot plate dipped into the cheese as the dish was placed on the table, this happend to two of the dishes. But the waiter was just oblivious. My dish was flooded with cheese, somwhere beneath it be the enchilada. I figure ok, its a bit much on the cheese, no big deal, ill focus on the actual wrapped goods. As I opened up the enchilada, i noticed there was a good size layer of cheese on top of the actual chicken. To be honest, I think I ate three small pieces of bite size chicken bits. The rest was just flooded with cheese. By the end of the meal, i had enough cheese left over to make a happy face for the waiter. Bummer, I should have taken a pic for your enjoyment. Overall, I will never eat here again, there are lots of other restaurants on my list waiting to be discovered. I give TeePee a sad face. I should have listened to my co-workers warning, never eat at a joint that has a drunk bull as their logo.",

Sort of kitschy decor, with red lights. Friendly staff. Quick service, and really quick food. The restaurant cleared out before 10pm. Chili relent was alright. Chicken enchiladas weren't the best I've had--the chicken was chunks rather than shredded, so it didn't crumble in your mouth, and was a little more difficult to eat. Nothing amazing about the flavor. Very generous servings, and very reasonable prices. It's right down the road from the tamp online place, but maybe don't do what we did and feed your face then go run and jump around.",

    "text": "fair to poor at best.   It has the classic 1970's and earlier Mexican restaurant feel to it, but, the food is lacking the same flare.    The food is more typical of Tex mex than anything you'd expect in Arizona.   If your looking for a classic Mexican restaurant Pedro's still has both the atmosphere and the food.    Overall I can't say I wont go back, but, it's just kind of OK.   Sadly Phoenix as a whole seems to have this issue, where much of the Mexican restaurants are just OK, with a few, very few, standouts like Pedro's or Carolina's.    If you want actual Sonoran food, got me, I have yet to find anyplace here though venturing further south on I-10 will lead you to greater concentrations.",

    "text": "Reviewing Mexican Food Restaurants in Phoenix is a little like sports talk radio folks trying to compare boxers.  There are so many differences.  How do you compare a boxer in the heavy weight division to a boxer who fights in the welter weight division?   How do you compare a light weight to a super-light weight? It's hard.  and it's difficult to do with Mexican Restaurants as well.  When attempting to talk about boxing there is a term people like to use, \"Pound for Pound\", meaning if they weighed the same, this boxer would be superior.    \"Pound for Pound\" the Tee Pee is my favorite Mexican Resturant in the Valley.  Sure, there is a place in Scottsdale that has Green Corn Tamales that are to die for.  LOS DOS, in South Phoenix makes some killer dishes with Hatch Chilles.  But overall if I could only eat at one Mexican food place the rest of my life The Tee Pee would be it.   The Green Chile Burros are excellent.  The Margs are fantastic and everyone I have ever taken there loves the Salsa.  I especially like the Cheese Crisps and when ever I go there I just ask for the daily special, which they have been serving for like 50 years.  A Taco, Enchilada, Tostada combo.  Wonderful.  Check out the Tee Pee, a family run restaurant who is serious about their food.",

As our waitress delivered the plate, you could hear the gasps and people asking \"what's that?\" as she walked by. It was indeed a monster creation. Unfortunately, it didn't live up to its hype. Under two massive mounds of egg souffle, there was one little green chili with a little bit of cheese. My friend didn't like it at all. I liked it a little more than he did, but I think he was right when he said it must be their \"gimmick\" dish.   Even though the Chili Rellenos disappointed, our waitress (whose name I failed to get .. arghhh!)_was excellent. She was so nice and friendly, but not in that sickeningly nice way. She was attentive and incredibly accommodating and helpful.   We would definitely try the Tee Pee again, but would just order something different next time.",

I ordered a bean and cheese burrito, enchilada style with extra garnish. The plate i was given spent way too much time under the broiler and the garnish (roughly chopped lettuce) was was wilted by the time it got to the table. The enchilada sauce was pretty bland, the beans runny and an overall grease taste superseded any other flavors.   Aside from the food the booths are really uncomfortable. Maybe we should have sat in the restaurant area in stead of the bar, but looking around all the booths seemed about the same - lumpy lump. Meh.",

The plates come volcano hot, which I love, as they are very generous with the cheese and my favorite part is the crispy bits on the edges. For around $8, this is quite a bit of food, especially after the chips and salsa. I like how their chips are thin and light and their salsa is nice and chunky, not too hot.  Service: very friendly and accurate service, she was a pro for sure.",

I don't like to complain and as we waited to be seated, I just opened myself up to this famous local gem. I mean, there's a reason it's packed and everyone talks about it, and well, as you may already know or will know upon entering the building - GW Bush ate here so...whatever that does for you. Anywho - the place feels dive-y but it has it's charm. Reminds of places I loved as a kid. But it appeared clean, so I'm good.   We waited awhile, but used the time to look at their menu on Yelp and decide so we didn't hold up the table too long. Sat, had the soggy chips too (as we saw other reviews said, and yeah, we were bummed). But chips are free, not gonna complain - we still ate em - whatever. But yeah - the food was bomb. I get it now. I had the Chicken Burrito and he had the Cheese Enchiladas. Great prices too for what you got, even the pitcher of classic margaritas that we split was only like $9 - dang. I definitely want to come back try some other dishes. We went to another local [Mexican] restaurant the following night that is favorited by locals but is [nicer] and more expensive - but hated it and wished we had just gone back to Tee Pee's (if that says anything to ya [ahem-Ticoz-ahem]).",

They were served super hot, which is a good thing in my opinion.   The service was just below average. The staff was nice enough, but a bit slow and not as attentive as is necessary when you have a table full of people with refillable beverages. Hello!

But the deep fried tacos were a treat and the shrimp fajitas were good. Comfort Mexican food basically. We will be back to try more!

Or the 3 day-old guacamole that came out dry, 1 dollop, no lettuce, none of the sheen that I expect of freshly-made guacamole.  This guac hasn't been fresh in a long-long time.  I used to get laughed at by foodies that thought other Mexican restaurants are the bees-knees and I would say, \"...not me, Tee Pee Green Burrito has more flavor\".  Those days are gone.  I don't know where I'll go, but it ain't this dump.  I've got an earlier review, posted, very positive. I think I'll delete it.  Bunch of frauds, Tee Pee.",

Last night I worked late and was starved so I decided to stop in before heading home.  They were opened late which was nice, I didn't want to feel like I was holding anyone hostage having dinner so late. Lol  Okay thoughts on food, chips were not any different than something I can by at Frys. Not the name brand kind. The cheapest brand. Ok. Not a huge big deal.  I was totally disappointed in the salsa tho. Fresh salsa is sooo easy to make. Fresh salsa is a great first impression of what your meal is going to be like.  Canned salsa means canned chicken.   So I played it safe with cheese enchiladas and a taco. The enchiladas were great, hard to mess those up. But my taco shell came out of a box. I don't even but this from the store. That was disappointing as well.  These few details would make a better difference.  Frying up taco shells and making a fresh salsa with fresh ingredients (not canned.... come on now) would definitely make an improvement.   I keep going back forth on stars here 2... 3... 2...   Would I try them again? ... maybe...  probably.  sounds like I will need to try a cocktail.   Maybe next time the salsa will be fresh.",

Not really a place I'd go to for catching a game as the bar always seems full or crowded but maybe I'm just there during extra busy times. In the restaurant dining area the seating booths are pretty cramped so if you have a party of 4 or more and they are larger folks, just be forewarned...",

He suggested here and when I read the online reviews I begged him to reconsider. He countered with the facts that he doesn't trust reviews and many famous people have eaten here (including a president). I really didn't want to go and I made reservations at The Mission (a place several people had recommended to me) with the hopes that I could change his mind. When my old man picked me up he refused to consider The Mission. We ended up at Tee Pee where we were sat near a restroom that I could distinctly smell from our table. The food made me ill and I was sick most of the following day. The irony is not lost on me that this place is called Tee Pee (as in \"toilet paper\").",

But it wasn't until my husband purchased a groupon for this place, that I was forced to go check it out.    My quick summary: *chips and salsa - meh, nothing special, kind of stale tasting to be honest *guacamole - nasty *Bud Light - A-OK *Chicken Tostada - decent *House Salad - decent but simple (it's just lettuce and tomato) *Service - friendly and attentive although it did take awhile to get ice water, and when we finally did, we were handed a pitcher and 3 glasses.  I realized it was 3 glasses for the 2 of us because 2 of them were stuck together - classic!  Bottom line: I don't eat Mexican very often, but when I do, I'll likely go elsewhere.",

    "text": "Back in the 80's I worked down the street at Old New York and lived across the street at Villa Manana.  I enjoyed coming here with friends and co-workers, sharing pitchers of Margaritas and trying my first Chimichanga.  Fast forward 30+ years and this place is now more of the occasional, sentimental stop.  The chips and salsa are yummy, house $3 Margs are rather tasty compared to many other restaurants house Margaritas.  Listen, I'm really picky about such things.  I don't want syrup and flavor on ice -tasteless, expensive, and lacking that kick that takes the edge off of the day. Lunch was tasty and really satisfied my desire for a taste of the past.  I had the Red Chimichanga, which comes with sour cream AND guacamole.  Other restaurants charge extra but here it's already included.  Two thumbs up. Service was just okay.  Kinda slow but always courteous and professional. Overall a very positive experience. We'll continue to make our visits here at the TeePee part of our random routine.",

Growing up in San Antonio, I prefer this kind of mexican food: no color only shades of brown, heavy on the cheese, heavy on the salsa.  Wow, now that I write that, I doesnt sound so great... but really, that's what I like.  And that's more or less what I got at Tee Pee's.  So food-wise, it's probably a THREE STAR.  But there were some real drawbacks.  The chips were slightly stale.  It should be a small thing, but you'd think a \"landmark\" restaurant could handle keeping fresh chips.  The decor is dated and cramped.  The old vinyl seats are ugly, but more importantly, they are uncomfortable and very small.  Two adults sitting side-by-side had better be very friendly.  Finally, the service is horrible.  And to me, that is easily the biggest problem.  The waitress constantly left our drinks empty and had to be reminded every time we asked for anything.  In reality, Tee Pee's should be right up my alley.  But their \"we're too busy to worry about the small things\" is a big problem.    I'm not sure they will ever get a second chance with me.",

My family has been going to this amazing joint for generations, along with most of Phoenix, and I love showing it off with friends who live down the street and friends who live in Europe! Last night, in an effort to stay home with our 12 week 'young' son, we ordered the Tee Pee with Postmates; which went against every good instinct I had. Although our dinner arrived right on time, as soon as I was handed the bag I knew there was something wrong in Denmark, and that there was no way this bag held the insatiably delicious 3-way Mixed Burro enchilada style with rice and beans, and a Sour Cream Green Enchilada with rice and beans that my vegetarian wife loves, along with chips, salsa and hot sauce. The bag did hold a cheese enchilada and a plain 3-way mixed burro; no sides. I called Tee Pee and spoke with their manager Kyle, who was amazing. He apologized for the other company's mistake, had the right order thrown into the ovens, and it was ready when I arrived. He and his team were all great, especially considering it was a busy Saturday night around 8pm when I called. It would have been just as easy to tell me it was not their issue, to call Postmates and handle it there ~ but the opposite occurred. Kyle represented his restaurant and business with flying colors ~ 5stars the whole way. If you love this place already, then I am preaching to the choir, and if you are thinking about where to find great Mexican food in a super chill atmosphere that is a Phoenix staple, all with a team that gets it, go check out the Tee Pee (in person, or call in an order and pick it up yo'self!) Kyle, thanks again!",

Ok, I don't eat red meat so my favorite thing to order is the chili rellano with a side of the Spanish sauce and a hot, buttered flour tortilla to dip in sauce.  I also love the corn/chili tamale. It's very good. My husband loves the pork tamales. The bar is so fun, but I will say the last time we sat at a booth in the bar the service was bad. Please don't change the decor anymore.

    "text": "Tee Pee Mexican Restaurant has been around for as long as I can remember where even a US President has dined there.  Ordered the Deep Fried Chimichanga with Carna Asada, Rice and Refried Beans and my wife had the Beef Tamale and an open face Cheese Quesadilla.  Good size Chimichanga and surprised by it being served \"wet\" with enchilada sauce over the top. Also came with guacamole and sour cream. Rice was slightly on the dry side and the refried beans with cheese over it was nice and warm where I usually dip the chips into. The Chimichanga had a generous amount of meat which I again ordered with Carna Asada. I generally like shredded beef but wanted to try something a little different. Was a nice change.  The quesadilla was not as crispy as expecting but was okay and I had a bite of my wife's beef tamale which was pretty good also.  Restaurant was busy for a Sunday afternoon but service was still not an issue.  Old landmark restaurant that still serves up some decent food for good prices.",

We waited quite some time to be greeted, ordered Draft beer that took forever, only got 2 sets of silverware for 3 people, then sat for a loong time waiting for food, with no drink refills offered, no explanation or communication.. We had to wave down our server and ask about the food, which she quickly retorted, that the \"kitchen is busy\".. We watched a table that came AFTER us get their food and leave BEFORE us...  So, I think there was an error made somewhere in the ordering and prep process, but no one bothered to communicate anything to us.. Instead our server just deflected, and didn't seem to be bothered in the least bit about our looks of dismay.  Once we finally got our food, it terrible. Never bothered to stop by and check on us, or see how things were. I asked for the manager at the front, turns out it was the guy who delivered our waters, and the only consolation he could offer was free beer, but no apologies, nor did he seem like he was equipped or empowered to be a restaurant manager.   We had an absolutely terrible experience here.  It was our first time and we live nearby.    Needless to say, we were super disappointed and we will NOT be back!",

It smelled and tasted so bad we could not even eat there!! The only saving grace was our margaritas but you would need to drink a few to get over the taste and smell in there.

I can't remember the name of what I had but it's usually chicken with cream cheese. It's pretty good, not great. Boyfriend always clears his plate- clean plate club!

Rice typically too much pepper, tomatoes not fresh, salsa not fresh, low-grade cheese blech.  Tables too small and on top of each other. First-generation mini blinds saggy, bent, filthy and old. Dingy wall kitsch includes glowy virgin, fake and faded plastic greenery. Add to it screaming children who at some point seem to be trying to outscream each other and you've got the essence of the ambiance which is Tee Pee.

The salsa was very flavorful, but the bowl of chips (while hot) were some of the smallest and most broken-up chips we have ever seen. My green corn tamale came cold. Yes, cold. And the rice and beans were average. Hubby's carne asada burrito was better than my tamale but it wouldn't take much to get there.

Years and Years ago Tee Pee was an institution for sloppy mexican food in phoenix. But my last 5-10 visits have all been very subpar. Lets be real, Sloppy mexican food is not tough to make, but being a phx local, it is in our blood to love an enchi and shredded beef Tacos....it pains me to write that the food quality is just plain bad. You can tell the owners have gotten sloppy, probably are more hands off than they used to be, and the restaurant is starting to lose its allure with so many other good spots in phoenix. Really is a sad story. My extra crispy taco came with charred beef on top and then all soggy-ness. I asked the bartender if she thought it was crispy and she replied, do you want me to take it back or something? Yes of course I do, I asked for an extra crispy taco, not a soggy meat rag. Of course, I did not say that, and the bartender did not ask if I wanted another after showing her, it was about the opposite of crispy....A phoenix institution, yes....good food, not anymore.",

Arrived during a busy time at 5:30PM and was told it was over a half an hour wait in the restaurant but the bar was open.  Sat in the bar at the counter and we noticed that several other folks were eating at the Bar so she decided we should do the same.    The Latino gentleman behind the bar was quick, attentive, organized, fun, and engaging.  Margaritas with Tortilla chips & Salsa came quickly and we were being taken care of well.  We both ordered the Green Chili Chimichanga and mine arrived slightly over toasted but still tasty.   Guacamole was very good.  Near the end of our meal we got up to use the bathroom and I returned first to find that the bar tender had given up our seats, even though our sunglasses, keys and her personal things were still on the bar.   Would 5 minutes have killed him to let us finish or order dessert?  Total was $43 including tip.  I had to pay from the food server's walk up area as there was no counter space elsewhere and our seats had been taken over. I've never been thrown out of a bar before, but this sure was a rude ending to an otherwise great meal.",

None of us had.   \"So it's a bit different,\" he explained. Something about 6 egg whites and an egg yolk. Something about half a basketball. She went ahead and ordered it anyway. Only our server and the pictures (I'll post one) can decently describe it. But he had it right on the nose.  Around the table, we had enchiladas (the Presidential Special that George W. Bush ate when he visited - holla!), some (very good) pepper beef thing recommended by the server, and the chile relleno.   Everyone left stuffed, well-treated (Portland, Oregon has NOTHING on Arizona for polite and attentive service), and generally entertained. Mostly on account of the basketball dish, and the signed celebrity photos everywhere.  Tee Pee is what our Phoenix hostess calls a hole-in-the-wall, but it's the kind of hole that leaves you filled to the brim. So there's that.",

However after today's experience, I am compelled to discourage as many people as possible from going to TP.   The food: greasy, bland, no flavor  The iced tea: I think I was drinking dirty dishwater  The meal: fresh from the microwave  My \"TP special\" was a store bought taco shell halfway full of cheap ground beef that wasn't seasoned. They gracefully placed my tostada ON TOP of my enchilada, which means the crunchy shell/tosada holding device was melted to the rest of the food by the time it made it to my table (a mere 6 minutes after we ordered - what does that tell you?)  That's it...nothing serious. No roaches or hairs or any major disaster. But never in my life have I been rushed out of a restaurant, minutes after finishing my \"meal\" (yes, I finished it because I skipped lunch in anticpation of this \"authentic\" dining experience!)  Not even 10 minutes had passed and the \"manager\" (some fat, sweaty dude in a blue polo shirt) came up to the table where my friend and I were chatting and he actually asked us to LEAVE because he had a wait .. !!! are you f-ing serious??? Is that how a family owned restaurant conducts business?? I thought the charm and appeal of a long-standing family restaurant was that they make you feel at home?? Don't these places thrive on word-of-mouth advertising since they dont have the resources that major chains have?? Kick people out on a Tuesday night at 7pm less than an hour after they sit down??

We had ordered ice tea and it was sour. When we mentioned it was old and had asked for something different, she said oh..ok, just one or both of you?  Well.. its sour for both of us.. sooo.. :-/ We waited about 25 minutes for a cheesecrisp-- not a big deal as we weren't in a rush. We didn't finish it however, because it was far too greasy. We had sopped up some of the grease but our stomachs said stopppp.. so we did. --Not before I had asked for pico and was brough a bowl of little onions. I said is this the pico? \"Yes.\" They had two one stall restrooms (one in the dining and one in the bar) which were both full the entire time we were there-- with 2-3 people waiting outside of each.

My boyfriend ordered fajitas which he said he enjoyed and I ordered enchiladas with chicken.  In my opinion, the prices on the menu were set sort of high for only having cheese inside it.  I believe it was around $9-10 for a plate of cheese enchiladas?   So I paid extra to have chicken inside and when it arrived they were drowning in greasy cheese.  I guess in lieu of enchilada sauce, they just put a dump load of cheese on top, melt it, and call it a day!  I probably found five pieces of meat inside each enchilada; I could only taste the cheese.  I seriously felt like I had ordered a cheese enchilada to begin with!    Then it took half an hour to get the check because the waitress kept ignoring our table, even when we were waving our hand to get her attention.  Our total before tip came out to about $27 for two of us, no alcohol or drinks ordered.  I felt I could have gotten better quality food and service for much less going to a chain such as Macayo's and we would have gotten to eat in a cleaner environment!",

On a whim, JD ordered a mexican pizza with fajita chicken instead of ground beef. It came and looked so good I had to taste it. It tasted good too. I was impressed and things were looking great until Ccc-rack! The pizza had some unexpected metal in it. We told our server who later explained to us that the slicer used to cut the pizza had broken and left behind the rivet that JD tried to eat (?)

Once you walk inside, the photos on the wall of famous patrons over the years gives you a snapshot of their (self) important place in Arizona history.   Tee Pee was one of the first places to popularize Mexican food for gringos, from what I gather. Non-mexican families began going out to eat here regularly and Mexican cuisine became part of the Arizonan identity.   Unfortunately, I don't feel like their food holds up in comparison anymore. The authenticity has faded and given way to a new generation of Az-Mex, one that I prefer, if for even reasons of circumstance.   I recommend it for out-of-towners almost as a historical stop but not too much for the food. It certainly isn't bad, if you aren't expecting greatness, but the food won't be what you walk away remembering when you leave.",

A side of soft corn tortillas came pre-slathered in grease, for some ridiculous reason. And for what it was, it was terribly overpriced.  That's not to say it was expensive at all, but Filibertos is consistently better than this was.  Somehow the two green corn tamales I got to go were $10?  Give me a break.

Don't judge this place by it's name (Tee Pee) or by the looks or even the 50's look.  But judge it by the incredible food.  The staple of many places are the chips and salsa.  How about both home made?!? The chips were light and crispy, the salsa very tasty with a really nice kick.  In our group of people (6 from our NOMADS group) there was only one complaint.  The portions were very big.  One couple had taco salads, one chicken and one beef.  Of course the 'edible' bowl light, crispy, and not greasy.  The chicken and the beef perfectly seasoned.  My wife and another couple had egg dishes which were cooked to perfection.  They also said the rice and beans were spot on.  I had an enchilada with steak and cheese that was incredible.  Usually the steak in these dishes is pretty tough, but not this one!  Outstanding flavor and very tender.  The red sauce was excellent as was the cheese on top.  Definitely a go-to place!",

A ton of food (whatever it is you ordered..) with a ton of sauce poured on top, with a ton of rice and beans on the side.  Last time my boyfriend and I went, I ordered the Chicken Fajita Chimi. When it came out, I got instant heartburn just looking at this plate of food I was expected to eat (although that also might have been the result of the white wine and margaritas I had during happy hour). Either way, it was daunting.  I could only finish about 4 bites of my burrito at the restaurant. The good news is, TeePee is one of those places where the leftovers are even better then the original. You heat up everything at the same time, it all turns into a warm, gooey, saucy, cheesy mess and you eat bite after bite indiscriminately on your couch watching reality TV marathons.  It's really best with reality TV marathons.",

The portions are generous for the price, but it's obviously more Tex-Mex than the real thing.",

If you come by when it's not busy, you can sit at \"The President's Table\" which is the table at which President Bush sat when he dined there with Jerry Coangelo, Bob Brenly and Artie Moreno.  If that's taken, ask for \"The Mayor's Table\", where The Morning Mayor Dave Pratt is known to sit when he visits.  Now I'm no fundamentalist, but I still can't deny that \"The Presidential Special\" (two enchiladas, rice and beans) is probably the best traditional Mexican dish I've ever had in Arizona.   Somewhat surprisingly, the shrimp taco is also REALLY good.   If you stop by, make sure you ask for their very friendly owner, Zippy. Ask him to tell you about some celebrity who's come by in the past. His stories alone will make your evening.",

I am a fan of alcoholic beverages, so a few margaritas before dinner seemed about right.  I was not a huge fan of the margaritas... way too sweet for my liking. But i came here for the food:  The enchilada was fantastic. I also had the tacos which were relatively small but very good flavor. We went toward closing time so we were one of the only tables there.   The chimichanga for me was the best item on the menu. The guacamole seemed fresh and made in house (didnt confirm that) and the flavors were poppin'.  One of the better mexican restaurants i went to while visiting Phoenix. I would definately return.",

I think the original founders probably did really care - but Zipp and the gang are really just out for the buck.   Nothing wrong with a buck but when George Bush visited there - their business went up significantly - and they raised the prices - Not everyone in Arcadia is wealthy including myself.   The staff over the years has never seemed to care about whether you were there or not - and I stopped going for a number of years. A few years ago - I broke down and took my wife in on a Friday night ------ out jumps a cockroach - from my wife's lettuce next to her red chile burro - staff just tried to keep me quiet and in my opinion insinuated that I planted the roach. Then they asked my name to take down the information and I told them ---- Nick - then the manager wanted my last name and I told him \"Bush\". They didn't laugh. I did file a complaint with the health department online.   I stopped going again for several years ---- and last month - I broke down and got food to go - it was not bad --- However, tonight did it and I am telling you in my opinion they don't care about the customer. I noticed over the last several years --- business has been down when I drove by -- and they have made some changes now to the structure in an apparent attempt to get back some lost business.   Anyhow ----- tonight I called up and as usual - their phone service was awful -- The fellow answering the phone picks up and yells tee pee - I couldn't understand him - and thought maybe I was phoning a Chinese place. Then when I told him I wanted an order for pickup - he said - hold on let me get one of my girls to get it for you. Come on - this is 2012 - one of my girls - excuse me.   I ordered three chile burros, one cheese crisp, one side of rice and beans. When the cashier rang it up it came to 39 dollars and some cents ---- I thought to myself what the heck is going on (13 dollars a person - notice it was only two side dishes) ---- I said I thought that sounded like a lot --- and the cashier checked the bill - said that it was right - and then the fellow who brought the food out said - the prices are on the menu - I said I believed him, just that it seemed like a lot of money for take out and not very many items. I told them that the pricing would definitely influence me not coming back regularly. Oh I must say the chips were included - and they offered to give me a menu to take - No thank you.   First, if they had kept the quality up from the very old days - gave the customers more and better attention - not over done it on the price increases due to Bush eating there - my guess is that business would not have fallen as it did despite the recession - so now they have gone into a survival mode type of situation and spent a ton of money on a patio ect ect ect. Well I am not going to pay for it - to eat  -- not bad Mexican Food (if there is no cockroach around), but definitely average and that is stretching it.   I will never go back and I would definitely - never recommend it to anyone, especially visitors. Their early success of providing a quality meal, at a reasonable price, in a quaint location - has not been followed by the current owners or staff. Methinks not and never again. I will search for a Mexican rest that wants my business, has quality food and charges more reasonably.",

My husband and I shared a plate of steak and shrimp fajitas for lunch around 3pm on a weekday, along with a couple of drinks at happy hour prices. The food here is standardized Mexican-American to the max, but our meal tasted well-prepared and we left feeling pretty stuffed. especially after an additional bowl of chips and spicy salsa. Tee Pee seems like the kind of place where people would go to drink and eat, in that order. Happy hour prices make this an inexpensive place to drink, particularly for that neighborhood.",

Its family owned and has a lot of menu items. It wasnt bad I just wasnt a fan. Their chips were really greasy but their salsa was really good! The people we were with ordered 2 Chili Rellanos for our 2 tables and I wasnt impressed. When you look at it you're thinking like \"wow\" but there was barely any chili and mostly all egg whites. blah. I ordered one of their lunch specials for my entree which was a burrito with red sauce, chicken and it came with rice and beans. I was expecting it to take a while for our food since it was so crowded but it didnt really take that long. I would prob go back and try some other stuff.",

The prices aren't great but this meal comes with a load of sour cream, guacamole, and chips & salsa and is delicious.  It's an older building and the booths are anything but comfortable but the service and food are great.  They also have a bar attached to the restaurant and speedy take-out service if you don't feel like dining in.  Their small parking lot is often full but it shows how good their food is.

I had the beef enchilada with green sauce, rice and beans.  I'll start with the positive: *The plate was straight out of the oven, so piping hot, I love how the cheese gets all crusty when it's cooked :) *The chips and salsa we decent, and they brought a refill when we neared the end of the bowl. *The green sauce was pretty good, but could have been spicier. *The rice was tasty, some of the best I've had at mexican places like this.  Now the bad: *The enchilada had barely any beef in it....literally had to open the tortilla to see if it had any in there at all. *The booths are really old and made of orange vinyl.  Maybe it's part of the decor, but I think it's time for an update. *The server was pretty non-enthusiastic, we still had everything we needed, but a simple smile would have gone a long way!

Cheesy, smothered everything.  The Happy Hour is killer - you can eat a feast for less than you could at Taco Bell and the food is 100% better than T-Bell. The cheese and onion enchiladas (Presidential Special) was really good. The combo plates were all good and that chili relleno - holy moly was that thing good. We got the one that is NOT battered in egg. The most surprising part of the meal? The chicken wings.  Yes, I said chicken wings.  Good ol fashioned Franks Red Hot style chicken wings - 6 for $3 and they were plump, amazingly cooked wings! Definitely dingy inside (made me slightly nervous) but once you sit down and start looking around you realize that everyone at the bar is a regular whose order the bartender knows when they sit down, the wait staff has probably been there forever and everyone in the place had a smile on their face.  I love Mexican food and I tend to have a soft spot for a good dive bar - if you're like me, do not walk, RUN to TeePee!",

Environment was part of the experience - It was relaxed with a very mixed crowd of college kids, older men in slacks and dressy couples from the Arcadia area. Booths look worn but were clean along with the tables.  Had originally ordered two Margs from the bar, they were not made in time so the bartender brought them to our table (literally in the bar area). Wonderful Chips and salsa were brought to our table almost immediately upon sitting and the refill was prompt once our server noticed the empty bowl. Our server greeted us within 5 mintues, not talkative at all but in a good way. After ordering, our food came out in about the average wait time, enough to enjoy our drinks and converse. GF had the Chile Relleno and it was...unusual. Basically a plate of grease, cheddar, chile and a mound of \"foam.\" They warn you before ordering that's it's not typical Chile Relleno so I cannot complain. I had a wonderful combo plate, served very hot and looking freshly made (no signs of sitting). Prices on drinks and food were reasonable and I would probably compare the food style to Serrano's or possibly closer to Garcia's in the East Valley.  Overall, I'm pleased with my visit and may return.",

TeePee seemed reasonably satisfying back then and I cant decide if tastes have changed that much or the food has objectively fallen off a cliff.   It may be a little of both.   Table service was friendly but inattentive, if that makes sense.  Decor is Flintstones meets Happy Days on the Oregon Trail. Or something.  Which would be fun....if the food was edible.  Prices run a buck or two higher than many Mexican chains; again, reasonable only if the food was better. Or even as good, as BajaFresh, Taco Bell or Chipotle.   In this industry, there's a thin line between venerable charm and past- its-prime trap, and if you insist on lousy ingredients and dont bother to ask customers how they want their heuvos cooked, then even if your front hostess is a doll, you're on the wrong side of that line.",

He asked us what we wanted to drink, and my mom and i debated weather we were going to have soda or Margaritas.  We eventually chose to have a pitcher of margaritas (poor guy had to stand there almost a whole minute because we couldn't make up our mind. Like mother like daughter) anyway, he came back & took our food order. I got a Taco. He came back & gave us our food. We asked if he had forgotten our pitcher. He said sorry and thought we decided not to order it. We clearly did and even told him we wanted strawberry not plain. We had already gotten our food by then and said forget it. He was apologetic. He came with the check and told us we had a little discount. My mom looked at it and found out he gave her the senior discount. Ha ha! My mom is 40 something and def doesn't look like a senior, but that was his way of giving us the discount. My mom was kind of like wtf... Lol but didn't mind the discount. It was a good effort on his part but she has a thing with her age. Anyway my moms dish was delicious. My Taco was okay. I've had better. It was just boring. Chips and salsa were good too. And i love free anything! Our waiter, bless his heart, was friendly and educated about the menu. It was fairly priced. The decor is kind of meh. it definitely needs a remodel. I hated the booths, the springs were broken in some spots. But if the food is good, I can over look all that. I will probably sit outside next time. It has a nice little patio area with tv's. The parking lot is ALWAYS crowded when I drive by, unless It's closed. Great sign, that's why we stopped in. I will have to go back to try the drinks and some other items on their menu. U wasn't very hungry when we went, that's why i only got a Taco. But I love some good Mexican food and def want to try other stuff. Place was busy when we went but had good and fast service. I'll be back and update this once I try more food!",

    "text": "Tee Pee was recommended to me by a friend as the best Mexican food in town.  My boyfriend and I went there on a Sunday night and were very disappointed.  The restaurant was noisy and crowded.  The salsa was spicy, but lacked flavor beyond the heat.    The guacamole was generally flavorless and had the consistency of baby food.  There were, occasionally, big chunks of avocado, which were nice but they seemed out of place in the puree.  The chips were fresh but, again, had no real taste.  I had chicken tacos, my 'baseline' meal for new Mexican restaurants.  My boyfriend had enchiladas.  Again... everything was simply so-so.  My taco shells seemed slightly stale and tasted like what I would get out of a taco kit from the store.  The chicken was tough.  My boyfriend was similarly underwhelmed by his meal.  The rice, however, was tasty.  I'll give them that much.  Overall, we will not be back.  There are too many excellent Mexican restaurants in the area to revisit mediocre ones.",

It was exactly a she described it: good food [not fabulous] old fashioned diner decor.  We had excellent service from a young man who has worked there 14 years who was the only waitperson on duty until 5:00.  He managed to be quick, efficient AND friendly and did not make us uncomfortable because he was swamped.  Seems like there are many neighborhood regulars.  3.5 stars for me if possible.",

    "text": "I came here last night with some gfs to grab dinner and drinks and watch the Angels game.  I guess I was on a subpar Mexican kick, after hitting up 3 Margaritas for margarita shakers.  The place itself is cute, very old school, and I love the comment on the menu that says no cigar or pipe smoking. My and the girlies went to the bar, because it's playoff time and I need my Angels fix.  The bartender was really nice and friendly, and was doting on us the whole time.  Love being a girl! We started off with chips and salsa, which were just okay.  The salsa tasted very sugary, and was way to sweet for my liking.  The margaritas weren't anything special, as they have the sweet and sour mix flowing for the soda gun. For dinner I got two fried shredded beef tacos.  Definitely no street tacos to be found here.  How sad.  The tacos we big and piled with tons of shredded lettuce and cheese.  Yeah...I'm just guessing this isn't how it's done in Mexico.  Actually, I know that's not how it's done. The portions were huge and I'd already been filling up that sacred real estate in my stomach with booze and chips, so I was only able to finish one taco. I'm glad I stopped there, because I was feeling sick and greasy for the rest of the night.  Definitely not a feeling I enjoy.  So even though the food was priced well and the bartender was awesome, the greasy food and lack of authenticity will stop me from coming back on my own free will.",

It's just completely crappy Mexican food and everything I despise about the preponderance of people who honestly think they know how to run a restaurant and make authentic cuisine. It's uninspired, bland, and perfect for anyone from out of town who thinks Taco Bell is indigenous. Please. Go elsewhere. It's also dingy, the waitstaff is bored, and the margaritas are weak.",

    "text": "Well I made my way to Tee Pee last night and it was an experience to say the least. I was on the net at work the other day and watched a teaser for some new show that Andrew Zimmern is coming out with. The episode I was watching was shot here in Phoenix at the Tee Pee restaurant. He of course ordered the chile relleno. I thought it looked interesting so I planned a trip to check it out.      My mother and I arrived and walked in and had a seat in one of the booths in the back room. This is where the wheels came off the evening. The booth was ,to say the least, uncomfortable. My mother is only 4'10 and her whole body was under the table. All you could see was her head sticking up and she looked rather unhappy. We then tried another table and found much of the same. I am not a small guy and I was having problems with the fact that the seat was a bit to close to the table for me. We then tried a third table and found the same thing so we just stayed there. Finally a couple left at a table next to us and we moved for the forth time and this was much more comfortable.      I ordered the green chili chimichanga and my mother ordered the machaca burro. They both came out pretty quickly and looked very good but mine was a bit on the small side. My mothers burrito was much larger. I tried my chimi and found the first bite to have a strange flavour.  It was something like a strong sour after taste. Not pleasant. As I ate my way deeper into the chimi it did get much better but still was not the best I had ever had. Biggest complaint was the shell on the chimi was not crispy at all. I am used to a chimi shell, which is deep fried, having a nice crunch to it. This was pretty mushy and soft.     My mother tried her burrito and was very pleased with the flavor. It had a nice soft tortia and the meat looked very nice. I reached over and had a taste and it was very good. If I would have known I would have ordered that instead. We also ordered a chile relleno to go so we would have a chance to give that a try since it looked so interesting on the Zimmern show I had seen. We finished our meals and payed and left taking our football sized relleno with us for later. I arrived home and had to take a bite of the chile relleno. It was NOT GOOD!!!!!! it was nothing but cheese with chiles laying on top with a ton of whipped egg whites over them. No flavour at all, and the texture was just not appealing. I had 3 bites and threw the rest away. That was $9 waisted.     All and all I would not go back to Tee Pee. There are so many mexican places here in Phoenix that kill Tee Pee in flavour and portion size, and they have booths that are much more comfortable.",
