    "text": "I took a party of 9 people who were attending a conference to this restaurant and was very embarrased. The food was awful. The burger was the only dish that was enjoyed, but it only had 6 fries on the plate. I ordered the chicken fried chicken, which I did not expect would come with country gravy, which I don't eat and sent it back. After a long wait I received it with a large bowl of (I think) brown gravy and no spoon to dip it with. When I got to the bottom of my mashed potatoes there was something black at the very bottom and when I asked the waitress what it was she just looked and shrugged. Two days later and I am still feeling sick. Neither my guest nor I will ever eat at any Claim Jumper again. I hated to even give one star. When we went to exit the floor in front of the door had been mopped and was very wet making it difficult to walk on. This use to be a decent place, but the change of menu and food makes it a complete zero.",

I figured it would be one of are usual spots, but to my surprise he said  we were going to Claim Jumpers. From the moment were walked in we were quickly greated by the hostest with the mostest, he was funny & friendly and laughed at my inability to count to 4. Mike our waiter was friendly, and took great care of our table. I ordered their infamous pot pie and was not disappointed. It was way too much food but tasted so good it was difficult to resist pushing myself into a food coma. I snuck by the counter and quietly mentioned it was a three people bday lunch and before crazy birthday surprises could commence my team decided it was time to go. Before we could get out the door the hostess with the mostest and waiter were bagging up baked birthday to go treats.  Great customer service goes a long way.... thanks for helping us celebrate!   We'll definitely be back!",

She made our dining experience over the top.  I ordered steak & coconut shrimp and my husband ordered the rib eye.  Clam chowder was delicious and the hot cheesy bread was crazy good.  The only reason I'm doing 4 stars is because my steak was a bit overdone (ordered Medium) I did not express this to Desirae so she didn't know.  It's fine because we will come next year when we work the Aloha Festival. Thank you Desirae for your positive attitude and making us feel so welcome.",

The chicken tortilla soup was good , $7 for a cup. My husband added a salad to his meal and it was like a sampler size. Maybe 1/4 of lettuce with some diced tomatoes, shredded cheese and croutons and they charge $3.99 for that, outrageous. My son got the shrimp Fresca pasta which came with 7 shrimp. They shrimp looked like it had been dredged in flour and pan seared. The coating was think and left the shrimp for tasteless. By the time he was done taking the \"breading\" off it looked like he still had a full plate of shrimp this meal cost $19.99. My daughter got the drunk chicken. It has two pieces of 3 oz chicken maybe on top of 4-5 potato cakes and drowned in the sauce. Completely unimpressed with this as well. The sauce did. It have any flavor Other than the tomatoes that were diced up in it. My husband and other son got the tri tip dip. It was the most value and tasted the best. Service was slow. I will. Personally, I won't be going back. There are better places out there for the money and time spent.",

Waitress was very nice but absent most of the time :)  They definitely pay more attention to the bigger table and never get back to you if you are a smaller table which is crap.  Prices were too high for what I tasted, I can't justify the quantity nor the quality for what I paid.  Waitress was overwhelmed with a large table which made our wait longer.  Manager was pea-coking around knowing we were waiting for our food for a while and never bothered to help her.  Beer was expensive :$  It's honestly not that great of a place besides the furniture but I'm not eating the furniture.  Food wasn't that great honestly we could of went to any burger joint or wing joint and got the same thing for a cheaper price if not half and immediate service.  The music that played in the background was loud and more like a diner or a breakfast place music, then it was punk rock, honestly it was annoying.  With the ok service and the little food and the high bill, I definitely wouldn't tempt myself to come here again.  Few years ago Claim Jumper had huge portions of great tasting food and great prices, I don't feel it is the same place :$  Took a good wait to get her to come back and bring the check, god what a hassle.  Paper bill came without even a folder and was wet and crappy.  They do deserve zero star and I paid for what I got :) and there is nothing else to say.  Point blank.",

The hand battered lemon pepper fried zucchini was outstanding. They have a new recipe for their thai slaw. Less sweat and a bit of horseradish now. Window Maker hamburger was excellent, but very big. It was a bit messy (But to be fair, I am a messy eater). Overall, much better than past experiences. I'm giving it only three stars, but will increase it to four if they maintain their recent improvements.",

I had their cake and steak which comes with asparagus but also included a salad and another side. I had the grilled veggies which were great. The steak and cake were good also. Not a huge serving but very filling. My wife had the filet which was good also. One caution is their desserts. They are huge. You should plan on sharing one so choose something you will both like. If you choose the 3 pound chocolate cake, it can feed 4. Leave room the desserts are all yummy. Most are kinda of sweet. So a few extra calories to burn off.  Great place for families or a date.

Some of my family seems to LOVE the Claim Jumper . . . my aunt and uncle went there twice in their week vacation here . . . mainly because they give you enough food to choke a yeti  But what kind of food?  I promise you most of it has spent ages pre-packaged and/or frozen, and has had more than it's fair share of reheating.  The first time I went I had the meatloaf and it had freezer burn.  The grilled veg were mush.  The turkey dinner last night was good, but only a notch above cafeteria food.  Didn't stop me from shoveling it down . . . all I wanted to do afterwards was go home, lay down, and rub my belly  Because see, that's what the Claim Jumper is.  Loosen your belt and force feed yourself.  They should rename it Gluttony Junction         Both of the people who had the steak loved it, felt it was well cooked.  The only real food surprise for me was the fried calamari . . . big hunks of nicely deep fried near melt in your mouth calamari.  The little endive salad that came with it was a nice touch, though way too much dressing  The place is inviting enough, some nice theme design quirks, and our waiter was very attentive without being cloying.  The wait for a table could have been awful, but there were plenty of empty tables in the bar area so we grabbed one.  The drinks are weak as shit though, and I say that not just because our group are all alkies . . . I say it because the drinks were week as shit.  The CJ hefe was meh.  So Gluttony Junction . . . not someplace I'd ever recommend, but with good family or friends, in the end it doesn't matter where you end up.",

They offer a decent soup/salad combo or salad/sandwich combo at lunch for only $7 bucks! The salad is always well tossed and properly dressed. The Clam Chowder is spot on with flavor and creaminess. The French Onion and Chicken Tortilla are not bad but they do leave a little more to be desired. Just recently I had the California Works Pizza and it was sublime and can easily be shared between 2 people. All the portions here are fairly large. Make sure you get a dessert to go so you can split it with family or co-workers, My boss calls this place \"Calorie Jumper\" with good reason to.",

The extensive menu was a small challenge, after asking the waitress about smaller servings we settled on one order of a small rack of baby pork ribs and one order of shrimp and tilapia.  Drinks arrived as did ice water with lemon.  We watched huge servings drift by as we waited.  Our order was prompt and looked great.  Both meals were delicious.  Great presentation followed by great taste.  The atmosphere was lively without being too noisy.  The tried the share one order of carrot cake but we were too full to complete it.  The bill was fine for popular-level restaurant with no alcohol.  All in all, a satisfying experience and recommended.",

    "text": "For some reason, my wife loves this place, so we land here about once every two months or so.  The service is inconsistent - sometimes our server is excellent, other times the service is beyond poor.  Everything on the menu (including the salads) is very heavy in calories, so if you're going to venture here, I'd make it a place to go after a long run or heavy workout.  The food is always fine.  I've never had anything here that was bad or good, frankly.  I'd stay away from most of the fried items, although my wife's post-marathon meal of choice is a Claim Jumper country-fried steak.  The best items I've had here are the steak chili and the fish and shrimp platter I had last night.  The grilled shrimp and tilapia on the platter were good, but the fried fish and shrimp were what I've come to expect from Claim Jumper - fair.  At the end of the day, I typically regret a trip to Claim Jumper.  At an average of 40-50 bucks for two, there are many better options in the Phoenix market.",

    "text": "I will start this off by saying do not EVER go to Claim Jumpers for a special occasion.  I realize that last night was Valentine's Day and they would be a little slow but they were terrible in handling the rush.  We made reservations for 8 pm and the hostess said that would be fine on the phone.  We arrive at 750 and did not get seated until 9:15.  I really do not understand the purpose of making reservations if you will not be seated and hour and 15 minutes after your reservation.  I also had my son with me which made the wait longer in a sense.  As i asked the manager who was on duty and the hostess what the situation was during our wait, they continued to give me the run around and had no idea how they were going to handle the situation for anyone.  We had a party of 4 people and 1 child and they could not find a table, yet they continued to seat parties of 2.  Whoever was in charge of seating did a poor job of making space.  The manager or whoever was at the front along with the hostess was very rude and did not seem to want to be there.  I understand it can be a tough job at times, but it is their job and if you are going to be in that line of business you need to understand what it requires.   Once we were seated they basically stuffed us in a both knowing we had two children with us.  Just very disappointed and bothered with the service early.  When we walked to the back there were 4 empty 4 top tables that would have been perfect for our group.   So when it was all said and done we were there from 7:50 pm to 10:30 pm. Not good for a kid on a school night or for people that need to get up early the next day for work.      With that said, the waitress on the other hand was great and really tried to make up for lost time.  The food came faster than the time it took us to sit down. The food was amazing and in very big portions.  I really want to go back during a slower time and enjoy myself (don't know if I will). It was my first experience and now I know why.  It is very hard to enjoy a meal waiting two hours with kids that are hungry.  We will see what transpires.  Like I said I am not downing the food nor is the waitress, my concern with how they are being run during special events and rush hours.",

We sent it back. I got the top sirloin and it was basically a piece of fat that had been grilled. The kids didn't even eat their food.

Your drink does not go empty without your waiter or waitress coming to fill it up.  You are asked frequently - but not too much - if you need anything.  If a waiter gets tied up and can't get to  you, someone else comes to make sure you are being WELL taken care of. The decor in this restaurant is amazing!!  Deer, elk and buffalo heads adorn the walls, a rustic look throughout the place yet has a warm ambiance to it.   The food is very good.  I pretty much stick with steaks, so I guess how can you go wrong with that.  But, the people I have taken with me have ordered all kinds of different things off of the menu and always give rave reviews of it.  It isn't exactly a cheap restaurant yet it has fared the storms of economic chaos, that in itself speaks volumes to me.  I have not a bad word to say about the place and I will keep coming back.",

Can it be any simpler? This was a late lunch for me, there was Hardly anyone in the place, the cook had plenty of time to get it right.  The fries were tasty and crispy and just the right a out of salt.  At first look, the burger looked like something you get off of a value meal at a fast food joint.  There 2 tiny slices of tomatoes, and I mean pickle slice size tiny,  1 leaf of lettuce that looked limp and paper thin. The beef patty was black in color, with the texture of a charcoal.  Being a late lunch I was so hungry, I wasn't about to send food back, which you never how it would come back. I crunched my way through the burger, paid my 16.00 dollars for a burger I'm sure would have been better right across the street at Carl's Jr., and left not hungry anymore, but not satisfied for sure.",

( and yes i now know how often storms are here:) After driving around, we decided on this place, since we never heard of it. Walking in, my mouth dropped open as i was face to face with the most huge desserts i've ever seen !  i mean these things would be what dreams are made of if they would actually fit into my dreams!    Ok so the lightbulb shoulda went off judging by the desert size, that the rest of the menu would also have steroid size standards, so since it didn't we started with the Avocado rolls.  WOW... no words..  just wow!  AMAZING!    next i ordered the rotisserie chicken with veggies and mashed potatoes, and my boyfriend stuck with the half rack of ribs with veggies and baked potato.  My chicken was extremely juicy and full of flavor to the point where i just couldn't stop eating it.  The mashed potatoes were def up to my high standards and the vegetables cooked and seasoned perfectly!  The plates were huge and also came with garlic cheese bread that was soo good i would've been happy with a plate of that alone.  The ribs were some of the best my boyfriends had ( although he still has texas roadhouse as his #1)  and we both left in a serious food choma.  Sorry humongous chocolate cake, but there was just no room for you today!   Def a fave of ours, so check it out:).",

    "text": "Not impressed one bit. Being new to AZ and remembering what my past experiences have been at Claim Jumpers, I/we decided to try the one in Tempe. We were visiting the area and had plans to go to dinner at another restaurant that was highly recommend, but being that we saw Claim Jumpers on our way to our destination and after a unanimous vote we decided that we'd be headed there for dinner instead.   I suppose our first sign should have been when our party of 7 had to wait to be seated even though the place was empty (second sign). We were finally escorted to our table all the way in the back in a booth next to a hot window (outside temperature was 118) by the way on our trek to our booth we noticed tons of tables empty for parties of 8 or more, why our table took so long to get ready was beyond me. After we were seated, we noticed a stagnant feeling in the air, it was just heat though, from the air conditioning not cooling. After about another 10 minutes our waiter FINALLY arrived, we noticed some hesitation as he headed to our table, but we dismissed it as maybe he had, had a long day already (benefit of the doubt, right?) he then proceeded to ask us what we wanted to drink as he threw (you read the right) our cocktail napkins at us. I finally just asked he pass them to me so that I can distribute them.  You would think even after that, why did we stay??? Well we were all looking for a piece of home.  Finally we order..less then impressed with our food, and I just didn't remember the presentation or serving of Claim Jumpers plates being that terrible. We had to order extra sides because when one of my kids got his plate he literally had 8 French fries, yep 8 because we counted.  To sum it all up, service was terrible and we were not impressed with the dishes.  Finally in conclusion, we should have went with the seafood restaurant that was highly recommend instead.   Live and learn, unfortunately it was a big hit on the wallet for an epic fail.",

No biggie, it has TVs and booths and it's the same menu. We had Amber as our server and she started off great. My boyfriend and I got a salad each to start off with, 10 minutes later we still didnt have them and when we did get them the plates were hot making my salad hot.... to top it off, I literally got 2 bites into my salad and BAM! There was our dinner, super annoying! Only reason I'm giving 2 stars is because my boyfriend (who's bday it was) liked his steak. I on the other hand loathed the southern fried chicken.... it was total breading and hardly any chicken and I had to load the gravy with salt and pepper to even be able to have some kind of flavor for the gravy to eat the mashed potatoes, I could not eat the chicken. It was blatantly obvious I didnt care for my dinner but Amber failed to even ask if I liked it or could get me something else. What a waste of 18 dollars!!! She also failed in the coursing of items. I left hungry which ruined the rest of the evening. The tacos from filibertos I got after the show were better than the dinner. Will definitely not be back and judging by the lack of corporate outreach, it's not like they really care. Lucky for them they have the traffic from the mall so they can count on the overflow of business from the restaurants around them that are actually good.",

Met a high school friend here because I needed to go to IKEA and she lives close to AZ Mills. Arrived at about 11:20 on Presidents Day. Place was just starting to get busy. Hostess greeted and sat us right away. Our server, Christian I believe was his name greeted us immediately and took our drink order. He brought our drinks right away and came back about 10 minutes later to take our food order.  This is where this visit goes downhill. Waited awhile for our lunch to come out. One California Citrus Salad with chicken, one bowl potato cheddar soup and one kids 2 slider meal.   Once our meals arrived my friends salad was picture perfect. My soup obviously had been sitting awhile, a skin had started to form on the top and my son's burgers were ice cold. Not lukewarm but ice cold. Our waiter was MIA for the rest of our lunch until my companion flagged him down for our ticket.   If our service would have been even average I can justify the $40 price tag, but 2 of the entrees were cold. And at $8.99 for a small bowl of soup I expect it to be perfect!   Will we go back to Claim Jumpers? More than likely, but if we receive the same type of service the next time we will probably cross it off of our list.",

    "text": "Had a party here with family recently and was severely underwhelming. This experience is everything you would expect from a restaurant right in the Arizona Mills parking lot. We had been planning this event for a while and had been in contact with the restaurant about our details. Day of, we entered a steaming hot and narrow room where no tables were set up for catered party. There was trash in a corner of the room along with broken tables and chairs stored there. There was a TV but none of the channels changed because the remote controls all of the TVs in the restaurant so that was lame. The food itself was mediocre, and we were served like we were at a feeding trough even though this was a reserved party. They brought out the food in aluminum takeout containers so we could just line up and scoop from it I guess? The portions were not really that big either so an 8-10 of noodles really could only feed like 6 people. Unsure of what they were trying to do or not trying to do? Not a very good experience and reconfirmed why I had never been here before to begin with. Yuck.",

    "text": "I've wanted to try Claim Jumper for a while now and I finally had an excuse to do so with my boyfriend and his family, so we went to the Tempe location. Let's talk about what I call \"A Series of Disappointment\". I can excuse our waiter a little because he was new. I understand there is a learning curve for figuring out time management and checking on the customers. What I can't understand is why you would introduce yourself by 2 different names to your customers. Anyway.... The calzone pizza is on the menu as 1 size. The waiter told us it was 2 sizes, personal or the size on the menu. Which lead into a whole conversation about the difference size, and no explanation why the personal size wasn't on the menu if they serve it. The other 4 orders were placed without any issues. We received our salads, which are labeled gluten sensitive on the menu and the waiter said there was no croutons or cheese on them. 1 of the members in the party wanted no croutons (gluten sensitivity) and another wanted no croutons or dairy (gluten and dairy sensitivities). The waiter made a note of the requests. The salads ALL came out with croutons and cheese. 10 minutes later he returned to inform us the kitchen didn't have one of the meals we ordered so another ordered was placed and immidatly the remainder of the tables dinners came out. This substitution was brought out after everyone else's food. That shouldn't happen; the whole tables' food is getting cold while waiting for the last dinner. Again we had dairy issues, after being specific about no dairy. The potato was also baked instead of mashed as requested. When the new potato came out the waiter made a point to tell us \"we wont charge you for this potato\", like we ordered an extra potato or something. Um no. The kitchen messed up, again. The french fries were soggy, cold, and floppy. The only way the fried shrimp was fried, is if it had been fried that morning. The batter was not crunch and there was a lot of moisture on it like it had been microwaved. The calzone was dough with some toppings and not good dipping marinara sauce. When we got the bill we were over charged for items and there were all kinds of extras on the check that were not delivered to our table. When we talked to the manager about the experience the only thing that was changed on the check were the items we didn't order. After nothing but problems there wasn't even an apology. Despite all of this we came back later for carrot cake to go. We paid for the item and then a few minutes later were told it was out. The waiter at the bar was SUPER cool about it though, asked if we wanted something else, and made up for the error. Which we greatly appreciated. Long story short, I will go back for to-go dessert ONLY (which is the only reason this got 2 stars and not 1).  There is no excuse for that terrible of a dinner experience. 5 out of 5 meals in our party were ether wrong or not cooked/prepared appropriately, including the starter salads which are put together right there at the salad bar. It's not like they're prepared ahead of time and taken out of some fridge in the back.",

However, our server, Bailey, just did an amazing job making sure that we were always taken care of throughout the evening.   My wife had the Jamaican Jerk Chicken Sweet Potato, and I had the Ultimate Fish & Shrimp.  The sweet potato was stuffed with chicken and bell peppers and were just delicious.   The Ultimate Fish & Shrimp's portions were just very generous.   Nothing stupendous here as far as dishes are concerned, but they are delicious and well prepared, nonetheless.  What made this a 4 star rating was just the diligence and attentiveness of Bailey. Her attention to detail was commendable and exemplary.",

Such BS to ask me how I'm feeling because you weren't sincere, when I said I'll just review you he simply didn't care!!! Hope this review makes you think twice about coming to claim jumpers! This place sucks and is over priced! Go to a Ruth Chris and spend your money where quality is 100%! Not this joke of a chain restaurant!! Not to mention Austin Walsh is not CORPORATE!! Read the other lovely reviews on this general manager!!  To claim jumpers get a new general manager!! He sucks along with his annoying voice.",

My husband ordered a personal pizza and I ordered wings.. when his pizza came out and he took a bite it was a soggy pizza and my wings tasted like they were cooked in the microwave; fatty and rubbery . The only good things were the drinks! It's disappointing when you go into a restaurant and have to pick at it because you're not satisfied. They're menu items are wayyyyyy overpriced!

We both ordered burgers on the sourdough bread. It was mostly bread. They didn't put the sauce on mine but did on his. They said they would be medium well. My husbands was medium rare while mine was well done. The flavor was good. Considering the size one could get a better bigger burger cooked right at Carl's Jr. The manager did come over and comped the appetizer. When we mention that there was too much bread and not enough meat, all she could say was :they didn't center the burger right\" after showing her it could fit on one slice of bread cut in half she says :yes that's just how we do it\". Really? You can't just use a different size bread? Or flatten the burger? Oh hey how about NOT PUTTING IT ON THE MENU! Not worth the money!",

The only reason I didn't score this as a five was our 1st server forgot us and blamed it on another girl. The second server was the bomb! I feel bad as I can't remember her name. Will make a point to find out next time I'm there. My boyfriend and I decided on Claim Jumper for date night and it was a hit. He had chicken fried steak with mashed potatoes and a Caesar salad. I had the tri-tip with the BBQ stuffed shrimp, mashed potatoes and a green salad. We ordered the spinach dip to start off with and they brought some bread. Everything was cooked perfectly and tested great. But the shrimp stole the show. It was grilled stuffed with a sliver of jalapeno, cream cheese, wrapped in bacon and lightly brushed with BBQ sauce. Nothing came close to being that good. I fully recommend it to anyone. Will be back again.",

With its high ceilings, expansive open areas, disconsolate surroundings and unending stone bulwarks for walls created a dungeon-like presence.  We were determined in spite of this sentiment, to try a meal, it being our first visit here!  My wife and I were in awe of the size of their menu.  Questioning ourselves how an eatery could support the number of items on their mammoth menu!  Also dumbfounding, is there lack of pricing in their menu, especially in regards to libations.  We decided to keep our order simple - first-timer trial and error as it were.  Starting with a simple Lemonade and Iced Tea.  For appetizers we went with their Mozzarella Sticks.  Our entrees consisted of my wife's Stuffed Veggie Baker (baked potato) with mixed vegetables, presaged by her selection of a Caesar Salad - she was satisfied overall.   I had their Tenderloin Tips in herb peppercorn demi-glace, over sauteed mushrooms and very densely grilled onions on mashed potatoes, which was presaged by a choice of soup or salad, I chose the Tortilla Soup.  Although my meal was okay, the serving was not much to write home about.  The tips were tender and somewhat tasty, but were over-covered with demi-glace whereby both the onions and mushrooms got lost in the gravy! By the way, we were served our soup and salad, not having delivered on the appetizer, which we had to advise our server to remove from the order.  Although the manager approached and very nicely offered free dessert for the inconvenience, we rejected it.  Later, the manager returned and told us that for the inconvenience we experienced, he would be comping my portion of the meal.  This amazed me, as most restaurants of this caliber will not go that far to make the customer happy, thus enticing them to come back.  This attention to customer satisfaction surprised us both.  Now, despite the fact that overall the meal, ambience and service was not completely to our satisfaction, as well as the initial uneasiness and disquieting atmosphere experienced during our visit - Claim Jumper deserves our returning to try more of what that incredibly large menu has to offer!  We shall return.  Bon appetit!",

    "text": "I am haunted by guilt for looking the gift horse of a generous work party in the mouth, but Claim Jumper earned the dental exam. First, our party of 40 was relegated to a chilly patio room where the tables were bolted to the floor, thus stranding groups of four on secluded little islands. I know the tables have to be sturdy to handle the hefty dessert plates, but the steel reinforcement is overkill. One expects slower service with a party this size, but I guess we were out of sight and mind. The appetizers and desserts were especially slow in coming, and adding insult to injury, those who ordered their desserts to go were served a good 10 minutes before those who wanted theirs served. The entrees arrived in such a haphazard fashion that one out of each table wasn't served for a good 5 minutes after everyone else, resulting in a few uncomfortable minutes while we politely waited as our plates cooled and our mates drooled. Injuring the insult with ickiness, the lobster was a rubber-bandy glop of shellfish gone wrong, and the petit filet, not much bigger than a petit four, was tough as cowhide. The sweet potato cakes on the side were dense and delicious with a creamy salsa topping. Had there been more salsa, I would have soaked my entree as well in some sort of liquid as it was painfully desiccated. Speaking of overkill, the desserts will easily serve three average-sized diners. The red velvet cake with buttercream frosting was outstanding. It lasted four days in the freezer. Claim Jumper is just the place for chain lovers who find oversized portions and dizzying prices patriotic and who require steel bolts to rest their elbows safely on the table.",

Colleague had a beer; I had a Lava Flow. Tasted like a tropical punch milkshake but with added alcohol. Yummy!!!    For supper I had the tri-tips with baked potato, grilled veggies and cheese bread. Everything was super delicious!! No complaints here!! I wound up taking 1/2 of it back to my hotel for a next day snack. =)   The desserts looked SO good but I had no room or else I would have tried that Monster Mud Pie. (I think that's what it's called!!)  Waiter was very helpful and funny at the same time. We made sure he got a $20 tip.   Location is VERY close to the Arizona Mills Mall. Go eat, then go to the mall for a few hours and walk it off. =)",

The manager asked if I was still hungry. I said no. Then he offered me a slice of their chocolate cake. Sure, why not? My appetite was gone so I paid my overpriced horribly cooked meal took my slice of chocolate cake home with me and called it a night. Big disappointment.",

    "text": "Two years ago, this place was a 4-5 star experience. Fun atmosphere, good food and large portions. My husband and I had Claim Jumper as our \"anniversary dinner\" place, and used to go probably bi-monthly.   On our last visit though, they had changed the menu. My first suggestion is that if you change the menu, the waitress should start with \"Have you guys been here before,\" followed by a \"Oh well, we changed a few things\" if they say yes.  My staple food is the Stuffed Idaho potato, and I had no notice that they changed the recipe. Instead of a beautiful mountain of chopped brocoli, carrots, and zucchini under a layer of cheese, the potato was covered with greasy onions, veggies, and peppers. Additionally, the skin tasted hard as if it had been microwaved- which is not the norm for a $13 potato.   The Zucchini appetizer had also been changed. Instead of large strips of zucchini with light breading, the recipe is now tiny (as in calamari size) strips with a copious amount of over-salted breading. I used to enjoy being able to taste the vegetable- now all I taste is salt.   There are good things though- the waiting staff is always pleasant, but with a  lack of personality. The chicken fried steak is my husband's favorite, and someone we go with always gets the chicken pot pie and loves it.   Overall: too expensive for their cheapened recipes (2 beers, 1 drink, 2 1/2 off appetizers and two meals was $80). Probably will not return anymore, which is sad since the Claim Jumper has been a part of so many memories with my family.",

It was dry and had no flavor.  She had asked at the beginning \"Do you guys want A-1?\"  I said \"No thanks.\"  A good steak shouldn't need any sauce.  I should have asked for a ton of it.. just ugg..  We also got their artichoke, which was actually not too bad.  I love the one they do at Cheesecake  Factory. if you combine both, you have the ultimate smoked artichoke.    Everyone was ok with their meal and one of my friends loved his.  He got the chicken fried steak.  Cant really mess that up I guess.  it was pretty good.   Id go back, but Im not the fan i used to be of this place.",

The food was always good and we always had a good time. I was sad when this location closed. I thought that the Tempe spot would be good. Wow, how things have changed for the worse!  I took my Mom here for Sunday dinner and boy was I embarrassed. My mother ordered a vegetarian stuffed potato (allegedly, one of the menu \"favorites\"). The potato was obviously reheated in the microwave because it was unevenly cooked and burned in spots. The \"roasted vegetables\" had cold spots and were needless to say, undercooked. The cheese on the top was melted but wasn't warm. The potato was dry and the toppings just didn't help make it taste good.  I ordered meatloaf. I received two small slivers of meatloaf. They were not very warm either. I had the same problem with the \"roasted vegetables\" that my mother did and my mashed potatoes were ice cold. I told the waitress about the mashed potatoes and she brought me a small plate of mashed potatoes that were clearly over nuked. The best part of the meal was the Diet Coke.  Including tip, this meal cost $38.00. Shame on you, Claim Jumper!",

Ten minutes later she finally came to take our order. The table next to us got bread with their drinks. We got ours when we ordered our food. Someone else brought our appetizer, which came after the salad. One good thing, our server did refill our water with the salad and the meal. After she brought our dinners, she forgot about us. She checked her other tables 4 times, while she ignored us. Finally 15-20 minutes after our entrees came she checked on us. Also when she brought my steak, she went to leave without asking me to check the doneness. I had to call her back to check the doneness. The steak was great. The kitchen did a great job. She never asked if we wanted dessert. We had to flag her for togo boxes. Finally she brought the check, after we had been packed up a while. Need less to say her tip was minimal. I normally tip very well, but she did not earn it. I would have complained, but the manager disappeared halfway through service. We love the food, but will not be back, because of the service.",

    "text": "I rarely send food back to the kitchen to be cooked more and I've never had to send food back twice... until tonight.  So why 4 stars? We'll get to that.  When my wife and I first arrived, the place was pretty well packed. Yes, there were tables open, but the greeters were out of menus and had to wait for some to make their way back to the front desk before we could be seated. The greet staff appeared overwhelmed. When we were seated, the person who guided us to our seat (Jason?) didn't really seem to care much about what he was doing.  We had to wait for a bit for a server to show up, but Amy got our drink order and our appetizer order quickly once she made it to our table. The loaded potato skins appetizer was quite good.  We put in our dinner order and got our salads shortly after the appetizer arrived. And this is where things started falling apart. My wife's green salad was fine, but my Caesar salad wasn't as green as it should have been. The iceberg lettuce was turning brown.  Not that we had a lot of time to consider our salads since the entrees arrived very quickly. We both had steaks and baked potatoes. The potatoes were big and fluffy and quite well baked.  The steaks on the other hand... PJ ordered hers medium and I ordered mine medium well. They were both medium rare at best. Hers actually looked rare. We flagged down Amy who was surprised the steaks had shown up so quickly and so obviously undercooked. She apologized and took the steaks back to be cooked more.  Chris, the manager, soon showed up to apologize for the inconvenience and to thank us for our patience. I mentioned the brown lettuce to him and he took the offending salad away. He offered to bring something in place of the salad, but I declined.  The steaks came back and this time... they were maybe medium rare. Maybe. I told Amy the kitchen was making the restaurant look bad. She once again apologized profusely, seemed genuinely upset on our behalf, and took both steaks to Chris. He came by and this time started out by saying he was embarrassed. We mentioned that we'd been at the restaurant in the past and had very good experiences before, but it seemed like this was a really \"off\" night for them.  He agreed that something had gone off the rails and graciously comped our meals.  The steaks arrived again, but not the same ones. They cooked new steaks for us and this time they were just right. Amy stuck around to be sure as we cut into the middle of both our steaks to check them. They were flavored perfectly, cooked perfectly, and we ended up having a nice meal.  Chris gets points for dealing with us both times things went wrong and for crouching down to our eye level for the second apology and taking responsibility for the mistakes. Completely comping the meals was an unexpected and welcomed gesture. He also went out of his way to make sure we understood that Amy wasn't to blame (we knew that, but it was nice to see a manager have his employee's back like that).  Amy gets points for showing her concern for our satisfaction and for being just as baffled as we were over the obvious poor quality of the preparation of the steaks. Meat shouldn't be red on steaks done medium or above, and the first two were red through and through.  Both of them thanked us for our understanding and for not losing our cool (yes, PJ has mellowed me that much over the years). We got Amy to laugh a bit and she got us to laugh as well by asking if she could get us an \"undercooked dessert\" with a perfect deadpan expression. She earned her 20%+ (before the comp) tip.  So, even though we had an adventure of poorly timed food service, confused employees, and undercooked food, Amy and Chris went out of their way to make things right, and whoever cooked the new steaks for us showed us what we knew the kitchen was capable of doing. They screwed up, but they took responsibility and handled the situation quickly and professionally. That's why they get 4 stars for what could have been a 2 star performance or worse.",

    "text": "Went to the Claim Jumper yesterday to check out their happy hour.  I've dined there before and the food is decent. ***This review is for their happy hour only*** Sat down and waited about 10 minutes before we were acknowledged, menus finally arrive, drink orders are placed (I get a glass of wine, my dining partner gets a coke) we wait another 15 minutes to get our drinks and we still haven't ordered.  At this point I'm getting the hungry cranky pains and the irritability is setting in...Drink the wine, calm down...  Finally the waitress comes back to take our order (bringing another coke and he hasn't even finished half of the first).. We order the shrimp taquitos and crab cakes. After another grueling 15 minutes our order arrives (with another coke). The taquitos are a shrimp (tail intact) wrapped in a corn chip and fried, they serve the 4 with some slimy sweet sauce and a poor excuse for dressed up tartar sauce. The crab cake (not cakes) comes out and it was pretty delicious, but at $10.95 it better have been. Here's the skinny on the crab cakes $12.95 for 2, the happy hour \"special\" takes 2 dollars off any app on the menu, knocking it down to $10.95 - what they don't tell you is they take away the other crab cake! Cheeky rip off!  Still being hungry we order the nachos, I'll post a picture later just to show how gross they were. The guacamole was brown, I think they added it prior to baking. The nachos which consisted of cheese and black beans. They were so soggy, I don't think they drained the beans before piling them on. Also the menu boasted of an array of different salsas, there were 2 jars, they were both the same salsa.  Bill came (with another coke) - $30 bucks, I went home and made a sandwich.",

I ordered the citrus chicken salad - the lunch size portion with the jerk chicken, cranberries, golden raisins, pecans, etc. I couldn't finish it. I am not sure what the entree size would look like, but I am sure it would be a waste. Maybe good to share?  I did not order the desserts, although they all look great and are huge. I saw online that a slice of the chocolate motherlode cake has just over 2000 calories. I think I will pass.  The one down thing for the lunch is that my manager ordered from the a la carte menu. Instead of a meal she ordered just a side of asparagus - and 6 stalks were $5.75. It is brushed with oil and grilled. She claimed it was very good, but at about $1 per piece, I don't know if it could be that good...my entire salad was $8.75...  The service was fast and friendly. She brought the food out correctly and had no problem splitting up those order totals for those with credit cards.",

It was sitting around for some time and was in eatable. The entree's were also a jumbled cool mess and I would have sent them back if I had been in the restaurant the meal was best served to my garbage can. Not my best move having this restaurants food delivered but we have had many family dinners there and home delivery from time to time.  The last several trips have ended in some portion of the meal substandard and worth the effort to let Managment know.  It's time to try somewhere else that can make this delivery system work",

When the food came via a food runner, I mentioned I was missing a side and was told it would be right out...guess who never brought the side?  If I saw the waitress before I finished my meal, my hubby wouldn't have gotten up from the table to find a manager who finally brought the MIA side.  He also ended up bringing our check up to the bar to pay, since we didn't have another hour to wait for our server to show.    Other than missing food and very bad service all around, the tri tip was delicious, although too much grizzle making it somewhat like chewing gum.  Very disappointing experience!",

On a monday night, I decide to sit in the bar area so that I can watch the tv, mostly because I am dining alone. Service was on point and was friendly. gave me the tip to try the happy hour mozzarella sticks, and I was not let down. So tasty and crispy. Only thing to improve would be to have more dipping sauce. For my main meal I opted for the country fried steak. I know that this is going to be big but I don't care.  As per usual for any claim jumper it did come out filling half the plate. tasty and easy to cut and eat as it should be. Though once again, it would have been better to have more gravy to go along with it. didn't they used to put gravy under and over top of it back in the day???  Overall, I had a very pleasant evening, and will likely return should I be in the area.",

While we finally out our orders in the family that was seated the same time had already gotten their appetizers and soon after their food. We didn't get much attention or help if we needed something else we had to wait a while for our server to check in with us. The food was okay but if you feel like going to dinner at 6:30 and leave at 9pm be my guest. Better yet don't go to this location I think they were very understaffed.",

The food was decently priced, well proportioned, and satisfying. One of the only times I opted for desert, which was a great choice. I got the Berry Butter Cake, it was simply delicious.

I didn't yelp a place near the movie theatre.  My fault!  I wish I did!  It was a Wednesday evening around 5.  There's only 4 tables with patrons in the saloon area, one waitress.  She was flustered and irritated.  Her service sucks.  The cocktails sucked.  Between the 7 of us we ordered HH margaritas, HH mojitos, HH Long Islands, and HH house.  We all had only 1 HH house drink, after that we all decided to step it up a notch and order regular cocktails ... hoping for less sugar and a higher alcohol content.  The food was only OK.  Nothing special at all ... everything fried for the most part.  We all only had 2 drinks and left the minute we were done.  We wanted to hang around a bit, have a little girl time before watching Girls Trip.  Claim Jumper wasn't the place for that.",

    "text": "When we saw a Claim Jumper, we were pleasantly surprised since we had not been in to a Claim Jumper in YEARS, but had good memories of the food. Despite the reviews, we decided to give it a try for old times sake. Sadly, I think the meat they served me was actually from the last time we ate there... but I digress.   The restaurant was relatively empty when we arrived. Our server was pleasant. We ordered our food/drinks and eagerly awaited the foods arrival. We were hungry after a long day of car shopping and had one more place to stop that supposedly had the car with the amenities we wanted in stock, but food first as we knew it could be a lengthy process.   Our orders went in promptly, but it took a long time for our drinks to arrive (no refills), the. A surprisingly small salad and much longer still for the meals. Both our meals looked good. I eagerly dug into the mashed potatoes for the chicken fried steak, which was delicious. I then took a bite of the chicken fried steak and something seemed....OFF. I chewed for a moment thinking maybe it was an unusual spice... but it was SO WEIRD, that I began to worry that it was spoiled and spit it out. Never in my life have I eaten food that actually TASTED spoiled!  GAG!!!   My husband then tried it, to see if it was a weird spice, and he too thought it was spoiled/funky. I stopped eating and pushed my plate away so I could let her know, even leaving the mashed potatoes since I was sending it back.  She didn't come back for at least 20 minutes. In the interim, my husband shared his chicken salad sandwich and fries with me. The sandwich was okay, but had more mayo than meat, which was disappointing.   When the server came back, she apologized and said the manager would come to see us. We asked if it would be soon, because we had somewhere to be. We should have just asked for the check because A) we waited for another 20-30 minutes with ZERO service or a manager ever arriving. B) we had a car we wanted to buy.   Long, disgusting story shortened, the manager never came but the price was removed from our check. This whole nasty ordeal took 2 HOURS!!! No inquiries or apologies were made, no compensation other than removing the one item from the bill (maybe I would've ordered something else??). We left hungry, grossed out AND the car we wanted to buy had been sold In the interim. Ugh!   I WILL NEVER COME HERE AGAIN!! #vomit",

Well let me tell you the food quality is barely fair, environment dark and the booths are dirty! Appetizer: spinach artichoke dip had an  odd taste of ham or bacon flavor...that really ruined it! Entrees: The hamburger bun fell apart after a bite and the burger itself lacked flavor...15.50 way over priced! The buffalo chicken wrap was mostly salad with very little chicken, tasted ok. Sides: Flash fried Chipotle Brussels sprouts with a mayonnaise Chipotle sauce drizzled on top....no heat to the sauce, so very average. Waiter was pretty good...a little slow towards the end as we were so ready to head out having to ask for the bill.  We won't be back....glad we had the gift card!",

My friend got the Happy Hour Sampler and said he liked everything...he said he is picky with his chicken wings and \"there chicken wings are good!\" My other friend enjoyed the mash potatoes. As a vegetarian My options are usually limited but I was happy with a salad, lemon pepper zucchini and their garlic mash potatoes. The lemon pepper zucchini is really good! I was too full for the mash potatoes but tasted them, they were yummy. The service was good...our waitress was super sweet and the manager even came around to check on customer.

My family was visiting from California where the wait for Claim Jumper is always out the door and it is not unheard of to wait close to an hour to be seated.  First of all, our waitress was very slow and hardly seen, especially when we needed something.  My son ordered a Margherita pizza that came out burned completely black on the bottom. We were reluctant to say anything because it took so long to get it in the first place. Once we were finally able to find our waitress, we had her re-order the pizza. By the time my son got the second pizza, the other 5 people in our party were already done with their meals.    The second pizza was so much worse than the first. It was literally sitting in a pool of grease to the point that it was so soggy it couldn't even be picked up and they used some spice in such abundance that it brought tears to the eyes of the 3 adults who tried the pizza (me, my husband,  and my dad.) When we sent the pizza back AGAIN, the waitress at least apologized and had the manager removed it from the bill.  No other compensation was even offered and the manager never came out to apologize. POOT CUSTOMER SERVICE!! And my son never got to eat anything for dinner other than some of the  loaf of bread they brought out for the entire table at the beginning of the meal.    I wish I would have read the other Yelp reviews before wasting our time and money at this restaurant.",

We were going to go to Joe's Crab Shack across the street but saw Claim Jumpers. So we went there. It was about 7:00pm with a 20 minute wait. So we waited. We ordered an appetizer (the largest one) my husband and daughter ordered steaks which came out PERFECT! My fish and chips and added on fried shrimp (which came out coconut shrimp which I asked for the other shrimp) came out so over cooked my shrimp was very rubbery. The fries were EXTREMELY HARD.And my fish.... the breading was so hard it was hard for me to eat it. The grease??? The 4 bites I took of the fish I felt like I  ingested about a cup of grease. By the time our server checked on us (obviously no 2 bite check was done) my husband and daughter were done with their meals. I gave my food to our server and was very shocked that we were charged for my meal. Granite they didn't charge for our desert. All in all I do not think we will be back at this location.",

I saw the reviews for this Claim Jumper and it was also walking distance from our hotel so I gave the manager a call.  Allison was very friendly and asked to call me back to look at her schedule - not only were we a large group it was Valentine\"s Day!!  She called me back just like she said she would and we worked out a plan for our group.   When we walked into the restaurant it was packed, I mean packed.  The enclosed patio was set and waiting for us.  Our servers got our drink order and jumper right on us.  It is very hard with a large loud group but Danielle and Margret were great.  They handled all our needs and keep up the pass the whole night.  It was a great night for us, the food was good and we had fun.  It was a little difficult at the time we were to get our checks but that can be expected as we needed 14 different bills.  Overall it was a great experience from the start with Allison beign professional and on top of it.  Our servers Danielle and Margret were great we couldn't have asked for better servers.",

    "text": "I'm gonna take some heat for this, but I really don't care.  I LOVE Claim Jumper.  Say what you will about chain this and chain that, but I hold this restaurant higher than your average chain and with reason.  It takes everything bad about American dining - huge portions, over-the-top decor incl impressive old-school ceiling fans, fattening desserts and huge tedious menus and unabashedly flaunts it.  I call it the Sierra Nevada version of Cheesecake Factory.  I've been going here for years - so I may be blinded by the nostalgia value, but I think the food is of better quality than your typical chain.  I very rarely come here anymore because every location is far-flung since Claim Jumper is adored by suburban soccer parents from here to Chicago, but my buddy out in South Tempe got me to make the trek last week for his birthday.  My favorites here are: * Tri-tip french dip, which is delicious and classically Californian.   * Rotisserie chicken with red skinned mashed potatoes or cheese potatocakes as an option. * Country Fried Steak - with the mashed potatoes adorned with a red apple. :) * Parmesan crusted chicken with angel hair marinara. * Meatball calzone which is bigger than your face.  If you can finish dinner here AND leave room for the gluttonous Chocolate Mother Lode cake or Mud Pie for dessert, I would like to meet you and shake your hand just to be sure you are human.",

    "text": "A word of advice when dining at Claim Jumpers, do NOT go there if you are on a diet or trying to lose weight! Oh boy, if this is how the stinky old scraggly gold prospectors would eat back in the 1840's, then I think the Arizona Lottery dude is grossly underweight ( <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nba.com%2Fmedia%2Fsuns%2Farizona_lottery_120.gif&s=1cdabfa08236e478839fedb29bdc975d1a471a7a73354b06152ffbc3df7b4844\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">nba.com/media/suns/arizo...</a> ).  I was fair warned by Chris T. ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/user_details?userid=TQo2DFe6O6LWALv_awgcCQ\">yelp.com/user_details?us...</a> ) that the portion sizes are very large there, and he wasn't kidding! You all know that feeling you get when you eat too much? I don't mean the feeling like \"...wow, I'm full...\" and you keep picking at the food. I don't even mean the feeling like \"...OMG, I can't believe I ate the whole thing!\". What I am referring to is that OTHER feeling, the one you DON'T want to admit you had. The one when you try to think back on it, you start to perspire and hope no one is watching you think about it. COME ON, YOU CAN'T DENY IT!!! It's the feeling you get when you eat soooooo much that .................I'm going to say it...............YOUR EYE'S HURT! There........I feel much better, I said it.  Now, back to the restaurant. It's not their fault that I ate that much, no. It's my own fault because I scoffed at the original warning from Chris. I said \"I'm on a diet, and I can be strong\".   The wait time would have been real long except I called earlier and made a reservation (I suggest you do as well). I went to with my wife, sister and her boyfriend and whenever you go with more than 2 people you have to order appetizers. For some reason you know you aren't any MORE hungry than if you were alone or on a date, but I think your stomach thinks that there is \"strength in numbers\" so you can take on a bigger battle. Anyway, we ordered the cheesy potato soup, some avocado thingys and garlic bread. For my meal I ordered a pile of pasta and chicken. I DIDNT EVEN MAKE IT TO THE DESSERTS (....ouch......eye....pain)!  The potato soup was pretty good, but I've had better. It had a lot of onion/onion flavoring which is a big no no for my wife, and she was excited to order it. I didn't really enjoy the avocado thingys, they had a weird taste when combined with the side of dressing/sauce stuff. The garlic bread WAS the bomb though. Very greasy and garlicky and yummy! It went great with my meal which was a chicken alfredo over linguine (something along those lines). I'm pretty sure they serve their meals on a garbage can lid (or at least a plate of that size). It was piled high and wide.   So here's the million dollar question....\"Why would someone complain about large portion size? Take the rest home and save it for tomorrow\". Well that's because your portion size is reflected in the check. The prices were higher than a normal \"fast/sitdown\" type restaurant but the food wasn't much better. So you pay for MORE of the same that you can't even finish, and if you do finish it you run the risk of going blind!!!!  Now I'm going to put my dark shades on, grab my long, retractable cane and go to Pizzeria Uno.....They are cheaper and I love the \"Rattlesnake Pasta\".......also I think they have a special seat for blind people.   :)",

The food has always been just okay. But THEN. Today, on a lark, I tried the veggie burger, and WOW, it was just amazing. I mean, amazing. It was a Boca burger topped with tomato, avocado, caramelized red onions, garlic mayo, and gouda, which I switched out for goat cheese. Seriously, this thing was heaven. My one complaint is that it was served on very heavily toasted toast, which I don't think the menu indicated, and I HATE sandwiches on toast. This one was delicious enough to make up for the toast thing, but next time I'll ask for it on a roll instead.   I could only eat half of this deliciousness and took the rest home in a box -  it came with a fairly large side salad for $9, which I considered to be a steal. I never thought I'd say this, but I can't wait to go back to Claim Jumper.",

Ya know how some places will give you a sprig of parsley or a twisted orange slice to garnish your plate?  Here they give you a small apple.  Yes, a small apple.  And it looks quite proportionate.  Yikes.  This is a great spot to come with friends.  If you have one of those friends who claims they can eat anything and still be hungry - bring them here.  When you walk in it feels like some old lodge with a large stone fireplace and stuffed animals on the wall.  So don't bring your PETA friends here.  No like-y.    Not only is everything ginormous (yes, I spelled it that way on purpose) but it's actually pretty darn good. This isn't inspirational cuisine or anything, but they do a pretty mean meatloaf and mashed potatoes.  The girlfriend's favorite is their Chicken fried chicken.  Dear heavens.  It's \"needs it's own zip code joke\" worthy.  Don't come here on a hot night with plans to go out afterword.  Come here after something else so you know you are on your way home.  Because there WILL be leftovers.  Enough for one or two days most likely.  And so far everything we've tried heats up quite well the next day.    Environmental note - Feel free to bring your own Tupperware/storage from home.  Use the big purse.  Bring one for everyone if you want.  Because not only will you using them mean less boxes in the old landfill, your food won't dry out or pick up any other fridge flavors.  And since this food may be dinner for the next few nights - these things matter.",

    "text": "To start, do not come here if you have a small stomach. What everyone says is True, you really will not be jumping at claim jumpers as you may break your ankles due to the weight you gain after eating here.   To start, we go here at least once or twice a week every week. We always sit in the bar and have become regulars so just a shout out to the awesome bar staff Lina, Johnny and Vince. You guys are all awesome and if you ever go to the bar at claimjumpers, make sure they are bartending and you will be well taken care of.   As for the size of the food...it's all huge and I can never finish my meal much to the annoyance of my boyfriend...I got their Motherlode Sandwich once and I will never get it again. This sandwich seriously lasted me for the next 3 days. It's about 7 inches tall due to the 16 oz of meat inside of it. That is a 4 person meal in itself. The only thing I have been able to finish to date is their giant baked potato which is huge and comes loaded with chicken, zuchinni and squash in it covered in cheese, they also give you a side dish of alfredo cheese as well.   The deserts are also huge! The cheesecake here is to die for and if you eat enough of it, it probably will kill you. The slices are about 4 inches tall and come with handmade whipped cream and chocolate chips normally. The apple caramel cheesecake is also delicious but to filling.   My boyfriend really enjoys their chips and salsa as they make the salsa there. They have two different kinds though, ask for the fire roasted salsa, it's spicy but delicious. Also he loves their seared ahi (I hate fish).  Over all, it is a bit pricey but you most certainly get what you pay for here. Also the interior is beautiful, it's like a lodge for gold miners. I would highly suggest going during happy hour at the bar if you're going to drink as drink prices are cheaper and appetizers are half off. It's 3-7 pm.",

I went here with a few friends last Saturday after we had our comprehensive exam and it was just alright. I really wanted to order a soup and salad, but that lunch special is only offered on weekdays (which is weird...people don't want to eat something lighter on the weekends? hmmm) and in order to get soup and salad, even ordering the smallest portion sizes would have been around 13$ (which is ridiculous). So I ended up ordering the tomato flatbread appetizer and a cup of the potato soup. The flatbread was fine, nothing to get too excited about, but not bad. It had sundried tomatoes on the top and was a little garlicky. The soup, on the other hand, was not good. It was the weirdest tasting potato soup I have ever had. It had carrots in it and it just tasted almost sour. It started to separate (I could see the cream and the grease) before I stopped eating it about halfway through. My friends got sliders and sandwiches, which I guess is the way to go here  because they said it was fine, I just wish they had some half portion options or smaller salad/soup options for more reasonable prices for the kind of restaurant this is....a national chain.",

I guess ordering fish tacos from a place like Claim Jumper was our first mistake, but this is Arizona and we figured it couldn't go to terribly wrong.  The issues started before we were even seated. We stood at the entrance for a solid 10 minutes despite the place being mostly empty. Apparently no one was paying attention or just didn't care that there were potential customers waiting at the door. We were all hungry so we persevered and were finally seated. As I mentioned, we all ordered the fish tacos. Our server recommended them and said that they were the best fish tacos she had ever had. When our tacos arrived we were not super impressed. The fish fillets on the tacos were tough and just barely warm. The corn tortillas were also tough, almost hard in spots. Everything was extremely greasy and bland.  Our server came back and asked us how everything was, when we told her that it was not good she argued with us! She said that their fish tacos are really good, but of course we couldn't expect them to be great because this wasn't a Mexican restaurant. This is the same woman who had 20 minutes previously told us these were the best fish tacos she had ever eaten! The manager came over and offered us a third off of our bill, we accepted because we just wanted to leave and certainly didn't have time to wait for something else to be prepared.  We asked them to split the bill into three equal portions, which they did without a problem. Two of us paid with cards and one member of our party paid with cash. She paid with a $20 bill (her total was $9) and the server never came back with her change! She just disappeared.  Thoroughly disappointing, I'll never return.",

Went there with a large party of 16 people (for a belated mothers day) ...had to wait outside for 30-40 minutes and when we finally got inside realized half the place was empty?! (I saw the seating chart on their computer which had red X's over most of the seating areas) We were then mixed between booths and tables (with kids) and after we all realized they had a full patio section, for groups, we insisted they move us (which they did) The only good experience seemed to be our waiter was decent and frequently checked on us. Half the food was good and the other half was definitely not resturant quality. I got the roasted chicken with green beans and a sweet potato...what they gave me was one of those supermarket roasted chickens/ a dry regular potato/ and green beans with this inedible seasoning + salt mixture...really???  For this being my first time experience going there it might have ruined things for me...just disappointed",

I have known it  to have a warm and attractive atmosphere where the service is usually excellent and the food is always good. Claim Jumper is a wonderful place to sit and be able to talk to friends or family. There is no loud blaring music. Claim Jumper has  got a huge menu that you can make choices from and you are able to make substitutions to their menu. This visit was no different. I came here to meet my friend for dinner where we both needed to relax and just eat good food and talk. Claim Jumper always has a very attentive wait staff making sure we had everything we needed. I think it's funny that they always ask you if you want dessert considering their portions are huge. Would I come back here again yes yes yes.",

They were really, really good and I was surprised. I don't recall that the food was this good, but then again, it's been awhile.   The corn tortillas were substantial. What I mean by that is that they were thicker and they didn't fall apart and crumble as I ate. The fish was cooked perfectly and the sauce delicious. I was surprised to see french fries with my order and let me tell you they were delicious. Our server was on it and my ice tea was filled quickly without my asking.

    "text": "Well... that was food.   Having been to Claim Jumper for the first time over 20 years ago, I remember when it was a novelty destination: comically large portions of food prepared fairly well. It might not be the best steakhouse ever, but it was a solid meal, one that you may regret if you try to consume it in one sitting.   20 years later, it's clear that the sun is setting on Claim Jumper as a restaurant. I don't feel like Claim Jumper as a concept has evolved with the American palette. Worse yet, quality has dropped. What was once a comically large portion of food prepared fairly well has become a medium-sized plate of mediocrity.   If you've never been to a Claim Jumper, oddly, I recommend going soon. Why? Well, not because it's a particularly good meal, but because I don't think it will be around much longer, and I feel like everyone should go there and see the Dodo of restaurants before it's gone.",

I didnt have to ask for anything. He kept our table very happy while he had the chance. Now for the WORST part... It is the responsibility of restaurant staff to ensure that their customers do not consume to much alcohol. Unfortunately the upitty females at the table behind us had been allowed far to much to drink. It started with them getting loud with the blonde with big fake boobs yelling, \"this is my best friend, isn't she beautiful?\" And ending with the filthy drunk Latina passing out and then throwing up on the floor under the table for like 20 minutes.  I will say that the manager Art handled it pretty well. He stopped everything that he was doing and relocated 5 tables of guests. Unfortunately it just wasnt enough. As good as our food should have been it was tainted with the overwelming smell of throw up. Art really was a crazy rockstar anx really did handle it like a hero but there are something you just cant look past.  I really hope that they had a biohazard team come out and clean because there is no getting those germs and smells outta the carpet and benches of the tables by the pizza oven.",

It took the manager over 20 minutes to come to our table to address the issue with our meal and he only came over after I asked out waitress for the 2nd time.  We saw him walking around the dining area.  He did provide replacement meal for the one not prepared correctly.   The portion sizes are smaller than what we remember.   From now through September they give you a chocolate cake to share.  It was awesome but as with our meal it took a long time to be delivered to our table.

Then after long another wait, a second server arrived and gave us the exact speech as the first asking us if we wanted drinks and appetizers even though we already had them on the table.  I made the mistake of ordering the Asian chicken salad and asking them to hold the crunchy noodles.  As a result, my Asian Chicken salad came out plain; no chicken, green onions, cilantro, etc.  A $16 pile of lettuce mix.  Needless to say, I sent it back.  Another long, inexplicable wait elapsed the salad was returned with the only modification being the addition of chicken.  Fearing another wait, I ate the salad.  It sucked.",

I started out with a Mai Tai - it came in a huge glass, which was a little intimidating, but it was mostly ice, so turned out to be a normal drink. Tasty, nothing extraordinary.  I ordered a 12-oz ribeye along with fried mac and cheese. The steak was cooked nicely, had a pretty good flavor. The fried macaroni was pretty interesting. Had a sweet crunch on the outside, and just regular macaroni and cheese inside.  For dessert I went with a chocolate chip cookie and ice cream - pretty good, and not a crazy portion.  Overall, I liked it, but just don't see a huge draw. I'd probably keep it in the same category as Cheesecake Factory or someplace like that, where I wouldn't make a special trip to go, but wouldn't avoid either.",

Claim Jumper has now changed my mind.  This is a solid 4 star restaurant for a chain.    I had the BBQ burger again without realizing I had it before.  It was a solid representation of a great burger.  It was cooked perfectly with some pink in the center (I ordered medium).  The bun was fresh and tasted like a homemade roll.  The salt and pepper shoestring fries were glorious!  According to my latest experience, this place is no comparison TGI Friday's or Ruby Tuesday's.    I also had dessert on this trip.  I'm a bit of a lemon cake snob as my grandmother made the best lemon cake in the world (it has been scientifically proven). I had the lemon cake for dessert probably against my better judgment.  Grandma Pauline is turning in her grave as I write this but CJ's lemon cake is a strong contender for best lemon cake in the world.  I will definitely be back to CJ's the next time I'm in town which happens to be next week.",

    "text": "I am commenting on Thanksgiving Day food at the Tempe CJ.  I have not been to Claim Jumper in years and had fond memories of the fresh and large portions they typically serve. I was so disappointed yesterday (Thanksgiving Day) to get such small portions with lacking taste. We were all hoping to eat off the regular menu but they only offered a limited menu of Turkey, Prime Rib, Salmon and Tri-Tip.  My Tri Tip steak was at room temperature, dry and so chewy I had to send it back. I ordered it medium rare and it was almost raw. The waitress was very nice and took it back and brought back a medium cooked portion which I could chew and she was kind enough to bring some sauce for me to cover the dryness. Again is was at room temperature.  My friend had salad and it was the smallest portion I had ever seen served at any restaurant.  I ordered soup (claim chowder) and it was also very small but the best thing I ate there.  The mashed potatoes was also a small portion, dry and tasteless and we all had to ask for gravy to flavor them.  The vegetables, carrots, onions, and squash were fair and all very low cost. This may sound petty but CJ is known for fresh food and  large portions and I expected the side orders would at least be their normal size given the price we paid.  I ordered the apple pie and it tasted like a store bought pie and was incredibly tasteless.  I only took a few bites and didn't bother finishing it.  In summary, the waitress was great but the holiday dinner was very disappointing.  I only wish I had taken pictures to add to this post.",

I figured they would give me the dressing on the side so I didn't think to ask about it, my salad was drenched in honey mustard.  I had the Absolut Tortellini which was also drenched in the sauce.  What I didn't like about it, which I wish they mentioned in their menu was that it is loaded with onions.  I like onions but that was way too much, I couldn't even finish it.    The lemon cake and the strawberry lemonade were the only things I really liked.  Our server was friendly and nice but the waitress on the opposite side of our booth that served the customers next to us, kept blabbing on and on about her life, which was annoying, I wouldn't be surprised if the customers were annoyed too; they kept trying to order but she would keep on talking.  Probably will come back once a year, wasn't very exciting to me at all.",

We honestly thought they split one salad between us. Another member of our party was eating the side salad that came with his entree which was bigger that our full size salads. We asked the server and were told that was the size of the salad. We had to order a side of fries so that we didn't walk away hungry!",

I ordered the tri-tip sliders and yes, I realize they were only $4 for Happy Hour, but even for free they would be gross. Initially they came totally wrong and cold, and then the right ones had soggy buns that were drowned in garlic spread. Glad there were only 2. That's all my stomach could have withstood.

After FIVE...count 'em...FIVE individuals attending to our party of three elderly female diners, we finally received our food ONE HOUR after entering the establishment.  We encountered a carousel of personnel for no apparent reason.  There was absolutely no excuse for this poor display of culinary service other than management.  The manager dumped us into a no man's land because we requested a table vs. a booth.  Nobody was assigned to our table.  We had to constantly flag down employees for simple things like, oh...I don't know...THE CHECK???  I will never, ever, ever, ever return to this Claim Jumper location.  EVER.

They could have drained some of the oil before putting it on the bun. And they need a better bun. They jumped on the Brioche Bun craze and it's wrong. It's a good bun for a sandwich. But every bit was annoying with the burger constantly being push out as we both tried to bit the bun. I like a softer bun that keeps everything in place as you eat.      The best part of the meal and an item we will ask for again is the Spicy Thia Peanut Slaw. It's fantastic.      We had a difficult time avoiding the 7 Layer Chocolate Cake. It was huge. Next time.      If you can, give them a try. I never heard of someone coming away disappointed.",

As soon as we got in we were told to seat ourselves at the bar or surrounding tables. All the vacant seats at the bar had trash. Once we sat ourselves it took 10 minutes for someone to give us a menu and utensils. If you really want to go home you may want to assist the guests a bit more quickly.  The server was pushing bus into ordering and trying to make our decision for us. Once we ordered our drinks and appetizers it took another 10 minutes to come back and take our order. The menus were left on the table during most of the meal.  My son's chicken tenders had no flavor and the rest of the meal isn't what I remembered when I use to go to Claim Jumpers years ago.",

When the appetizers were brought to the table I asked if they could direct some air our way as we just could not cool off from the walk-in (Saturday the 27th) as it was 113 degrees outside.  We were then informed there was NO AC. The service was wonderful but the food was mediocre.  We had to return 2 orders as they were cooked wrong. Upon paying the bill we were informed they are no longer part of Landary Cooperation they are now owned by Kelly Group.  The AC has been out since June 15th!!!! What are they thinking????",

Noise level was pretty low, lighting was just right. I came with a party of 5, and we ordered the Bonanza platter for an appetizer. It was just the perfect size for us  then I had the Club Sandwich and it was amazing! Quite a bit of food on that plate,m and slightly greasy but I'd order that again. Drinks weren't bad either. I had two Long Islands and they were satisfying to say the least. I would definitely recommend checking this place out if you haven't before.",

Upon entering the restaurant we looked for any glimmer of hope as to where to go, finally we walked up to the would be hostess who had up until that point had completely ignored us. She did finally say hi and seated us.  It was slow and seemed clean and like most chains for decor.   The server was super nice and checked on us regularly. She earned her tip and we gave her the standard 20, even given the rest of the experience.   We had the meatloaf, the Tri Tip Dip and the Clubhouse. The meatloaf was dry, the dip was super good (in terms of a 12 year old) and I sent the clubhouse back after eating just one quarter. It tasted like stale bread that had been frozen and unfrozen several times.  Sadly a club is something that's really hard to mess up, I've had gas station hits dogs that tasted better.   The server was super apologetic about the food asked if I wanted anything else. She's also the reason this place gets 2 stars. Unfortunately the taste the sandwich left also changed the way the beer tasted to me, so I just went without a new order. Even with that being removed it was $55 for 2 people to eat, which seemed super expensive for the food quality.   Not a great or even average experience here that won't be repeated anytime soon.",

    "text": "The visit started out on the wrong foot.  It's 110 outside and I walked into their restaurant hoping to escape the heat and enjoy a nice meal and a cold beer, courtesy of my $25 birthday reward.  That idea was quickly put to bed.  The restaurant was hotter than the inside of a kangaroo's pouch, with zero cool air flowing through the bar.  I actually had to pull out a personal fan to cool myself.  Then I was told after I ordered all of our food that Claim Jumper's is no longer affiliated with Landry's meaning my $25 reward was not going to happen.  A tidbit that Landry's didn't believe it was important to reveal on their website, which I had carefully checked that morning. Oh well, there is still my cold beer to look forward to.  Yeah....no.  Lukewarm, at best and spilled and splashed on my toes (wearing sandals) and all over our table, without even a whisper of an apology from the server.  Food however, was satisfactory, just a little bit greasy and certainly not the healthy portion sizes that Claimjumpers has always been known for.  Without the Landry's Select affiliation and a clear disinterest on the part of management to run the air conditioning at a temperature above 88, I don't think I will be returning until perhaps the Winter or Fall and that will only be in situations where everything else happens to be closed in my neighborhood.",

    "text": "I used to go to Claim Jumper in Southern California and had fond memories. I've been coming to this location for many years, on and off, not a favorite, but not bad. I've returned because it's in a relatively centralized location right off the freeway that's easy to get to. The food, for the most part, is simply middle of the road. Why 3 stars? Read on for an honest multi-faceted review...  Atmosphere: it's actually a warm and cozy place, pretty darn comfortable, almost a little cowboy-ish, warm woods, leather, stone and even a fireplace when you walk in; love that. It's not too loud, each table and booth feels almost private even though it's not. There's lots of soft surfaces around to soak up noise so the ambience is really pretty good. Great place for large groups because it's big inside, but still good for just two or three also. It's cool that you could come here for totally casual experience or even a business meeting and feel comfortable either way. They have a really nice, spacious bar area with TVs and more comfy seating. I rate atmosphere a pretty high 9 out of 10.  Service: I've always found the service here to be extremely friendly, from bartenders to servers to host and hostess's and even the managers who will occasionally walk around and check on you, a nice touch. Even though they have a lot of ground to cover because the place is spacious, the service is relatively attentive and consistently friendly. Food comes out pretty quick and it's served with a smile. No complaints here. I rate service a strong 9 out of 10.  --- If my review were to stop here, based on atmosphere and service alone, it would be a 4.5 out of 5 stars. But, read on...  Food: here is where the review takes a bit of a hit (that really wasn't supposed to rhyme). It is mediocre, and I've tried lots of it, the result is always the same. While the portion sizes are large, no denying that, the quality and taste are consistently middle of the road, or \"average.\" They are certainly not trying to win any \"well seasoned, unique, flavorful\" food prizes here. All the food is clearly made for the masses. If that's your thing, if you like chain tasting food, and no judgment here, you're in luck! I find the food to be of fair quality, served at fair temperatures, relatively bland, not terribly interesting or exciting, but it works well for \"fuel\". It's not bad, you simply will not likely walk away saying \"wow, that was an incredible meal!\" At the same time, you likely won't walk away entirely disappointed. Basically, it'll get you to your next meal for a reasonable, maybe a tad high, price.  So, do I recommend Claim Jumper? For a general outing where you're not looking for anything spectacular and not looking to impress, it'll do the job. The food is middle of the road, but the atmosphere and service are good. The reason I've returned multiple times is the location. It's pretty convenient. My recommendation is, keep your food \"taste\" expectations low and appreciate the quantity, the atmosphere and the service and you'll be in good shape.",

Got there 6:10 left 7:43 only had water iced tea and three appetizers....took nearly 15 minutes to get acknowledgement, the AC is broke so we asked to increase fan speed....big fat no can do....then the server young lady about 5-5 big fake eyelashes hair in a bun says \"ya know, there are other places to go have dinner that have AC\" ..what? AYFKM? So I tell her I'd like my drinks because it near 85 and it takes 15 minutes because the manager now needs to change serves (likely a good idea) and the second server (Marcie) is about the same listless efforts or they're severely understaffed....here's the deal, I go because the food is good when it's hot, but these two ladies who work in the bar area are the same lackluster nonchalant efforts Everytime...uggg...and the manager...didn't even introduce himself was equally apathetic and paused when I asked him if he agreed with my assessment of the initial servers carefree push customers away mentality...so...if you go here...good luck because the last three times (this will be my last) it's the same malarkey malady managed by an equally incompetent manager ...in my humble opinion....  Look folks, it's a broken AC...I get it...but not the clients fault, and saying they can't manage the fan spped to me seems pretty unsatisfying to this customer...I don't begrudge the bad attitude..hot environmental conditions do suck...but customers comfort is not unreasonable to expect..if you can't don't be disrespectful of the money they chose to spend at your establishment....and the manager, well if that's his staff, then it's a reflection of his leadership and should be on the chopping block because he offered no solutions, just a blank stare...great customer service huh?",

What I really can't overlook, however, is the intrusiveness of the wait staff. On three (3!) separate occasions, I was blatantly interrupted while speaking to my tablemates.   The most irritating instance came when I was in the middle of a conversation with one of my older relatives--the waitress appeared in front of us and cut me off shamelessly, only to start telling someone else at the table about Claim Jumper's \"loyalty program.\" Apparently, her advertisement couldn't wait.   I decided not to make a big deal about it, even after the third time, but by that point I was tempted to ask them to stay away from our table entirely until it was time to give us the check.  While I'm sure she was just fulfilling company policy by pitching us the loyalty program, it is extremely rude to repeatedly bull-rush your way through a customer's conversation. We only see the people we were eating with maybe twice a year, but it feels like our waitress did more talking than anyone else at the table.",

Actually they're outrageous prices for the value... ordered two combo and the chef beat the he'll out of it because it was thin and a half of a chicken breast & beef tip was thin slices 5 pieces dollar coin sizes for $26 and ridiculous prices for a hamburger. Dont recommend this restaurant and we won't be back.",

I had the chicken fried steak....which came out covering the whole plate...it was mostly breading that was too hard to eat. and the country gravy was very watery and had no flavor....  hubby ate his seafood jamb la said it was ok... over $70  for a meal that sucked....and server hardly checked on us to see if we needed more drinks or anything... we will not be going back",

Secondly I ordered the Meat loaf and after about 10 minutes INTO ordering this guy (Manager) comes to the table with a oh well  figure it out attitude to tell me they were out of meat loaf !!!!!!!! I ordered the fried steak what a horrible decision it was advertised as angus beef but it tastes and looked like a Swanson frozen dinner entree  Over all this was a horrible experience  This Claim Jumpers the way I have experienced them in the past does not  meet standards, quality or Management skills I have experienced in the past  You almost get a sense that they know it's bad but who cares I really believe this Tempe location is getting ready to close just by the quality and atmosphere I experienced  I'm going to REDO my Birthday dinner tonight and forget I ever went CLAIM JUMPERS IN TEMPE AZ now that I've Yelped about....

Well we were in town for the Automatic Body homecoming so word got out that Claim Jumpers was the place for dinner.  Our dinner party ending up growing to not only need the large table setup for our group but other booths in the surrounding area.  Drew was very attentive and was able to get drinks and food out in a timely manner.   You wouldn't have known we were in a large party.  Almost everyone was pleased with their food.  We had one steak that wasn't cooked correctly. As soon as Drew came around and saw the steak he says that isn't right and immediately had the cook prepare another one.   They had a replacement steak out in about 12 minutes. Was told it was amazing.  Overall Claim Jumpers pulled off a great dinner for such a large group.  Drew did a great job giving out separate tabs and getting them all accurate.",

I always get the chicken on the side, and they didn't bring it with my meal, so they had to go back to the kitchen and brought it about 5 minutes later.   They maybe give you a scant 1/4 cup of chicken now, and it is not by any means blackened. It tastes either pre cooked or boiled and their 'blackened' seasoning tastes like oregano and (maybe- if any) black pepper.  It was pretty awful. The pasta was a little greasy and bland on its own.  My boyfriend had the tri-tip.  It was alright but nothing special, it was also served a little cold do he was disappointed about that. They used to do a really good job with their food, its too bad their prices went up and the quality went down.",

The manager did give us the discount after I argued with the very green waiter. Food service was extremely slow. Drinks never got refilled. The waiter never came to check on us.

I immediately declined as I had no desire to go to a fancy applebees-esque restaurant......so I yelped the location and saw all the bad reviews.  None the less, my wife and daughter wanted to see her family- so we went   Upon arrival; on this labor day - it was a warm, musty 85-90 degrees inside the restaurant. Looking back at their yelp, this means ac has been broken 2+ months...unacceptable  Our waitress tried her best, but the kitchen/management/understaffing showed through  1. No bread was offered 2. Salads came out over 30 mins after entree order was placed. 3. Food was delivered over 45 mins after order 4. Food was delivered on either a plate that was 200 degrees; or food was cold (my tri-tip and veggies) 5. Drinks were consistently not filled 6. Checks were wrong, we were overcharged 7. Obviously manager hid in back, never came out to try to fix situation or apologize  8. Waitress was sweating bc it was so hot in restaurant.  Dont go here. This location should close. Bring your own fan/mister/personal ac if you dare  I will not be back- not even for family time",

I grew up eating Claim Jumpers back home in California but haven't really had it in Arizona since they changed owners.   The place wasn't very packed when we first arrived. The hockey game was on and in a blink of an eye happy hour got packed. They have a happy hour that is longer than most and runs from 3pm until they close. Knowing this we dove right into the Happy hour menu and were pleasantly surprised. Most places have a small limited menu but Claim Jumpers offers a wide variety with tiered pricing and have almost all your favorite menu items.   The food and service was fast and efficient. The only thing we waited on was extra ranch. A girls gotta have ranch for her wings.   Now I don't know who was making our cocktails that night but I'd like to give a special thank you as these were not only strong but delicious.  I was pleasantly surprised by my experience and think this is a great venue for a night out especially with their extended happy hour timeframes",

We asked for our steak \"Pittsburgh\" style, and our waitress literally said she didn't know what it was and the cook doesn't speak good enough English so she won't be able to explain to him what it is! She then proceeded to take our order and said she'd bring bread. The bread never came...until after we ate our steak. And then no butter.   This location could use a facelift and staff training. Like I said, I love Claim Jumpers food, just hope for a better experience next time.",

    "text": "I wish I had checked Yelp instead of listening to Siri and her opinion. Siri gave this place 4 stars. It's barely 2 stars.  I ordered a sirloin steak dinner with a baked potato and a wedge salad. The wedge salad was the highlight of the meal, with blue cheese and balsamic and other stuff that was just yummy. The lettuce was absolutely fresh and cold, which is how I like it.  The sirloin was 7 ounces, but had gristle, which I don't expect to get at a steakhouse. I ordered it medium rare or it might have been a little too rare. Thankfully, I can deal with that. Not everyone can.  The baked potato tasted like it had been put in the Refrigerator yesterday for making potato skins today. Instead they reheated it and gave it to me as a baked potato. It has that refrigerator taste.  After one or two bites of my steak, I was trying to get the waiters attention so I could request some bread or rolls. Never happened and I finally asked a busboy to get his attention. He did tell the waiter, but the waiter didn't show up for at least 10 more minutes. His name is Nate. After asking for bread or rolls, he comes back another 10 minutes later and says something about that they were baking fresh bread in the kitchen. It's really too late to save the meal for me. I want to order dessert, but I would rather drive somewhere else and be disappointed. It looks like all they have is cheesecake anyway.   The place is huge and relatively empty. Absolutely no reason for poor service by the server. I can't leave a tip.",

Opting for the wedge salad, then salmon accompanied by rice and asparagus, I was super satisfied while dining solo on a business trip to Tempe.  Ingredients and flavors were good and portions were hearty.  With so many food options, combined with a reasonable price point, claim jumper is worth a try.  The table service was good plus they even have a private parking lot.     It would be a miss if I didn't tell you about the desserts.  Over the years, I have consumed the chocolate cake, carrot cake, and the chocolate chip cookie.  All are decadent.  The chocolate cake will blow you away.   Are you feeling hungry?  Salute!",

Today the outside temperature was 111 here in Arizona and they had fans up on walls blowing on you. Not only did this seem unsanitary and unhealthy, it was tacky. A $30 meal each brought cold coconut shrimp, chewy and not even fresh. A hard, very under cooked cool-barely warmed baked potato. A tiny salad. Ribs and tri tip were decent, fish and chips were ok but not hot and the alcoholic drinks were watered down. (i know because I am a light weight and one drink is enough for me). We had three drinks. We told the waitress about the cold potato and she brought another in 2 minutes. It was worse than the first. Very hard and cool. The butter didn't even melt. I left it untouched and she saw it and never addressed it or gave us another option. The whole meal was absolutely disappointing and we won't return.",

    "text": "What does it take to understand that a business, such as Claim Jumper, is there to provide service, in turn, if a customer is satisfied, they will receive return patronage. Well, this is isn't what happened in my case earlier this evening.  The waitress started ok, rushed a little, but I had entered with somewhat knowing what I wanted: chicken. I, I can't remember the exact item-it had mushrooms with a wine marinade-a dinner salad with honey mustard and opted for a baked potato instead of the mashed potato. I also asked for ranch dressing so that I could place on the baked potato. That was the last time I would see the waitress for a long while.  As previously noted, I ordered the dinner salad and realized that it was taking a while for it to be served, so I was about to walk to the front counter to ask why service was taking so long when it was dropped off at my table. The side portion of the honey mustard was light so, luckily for me, I flagged my waitress for a 2nd helping of the dressing; I never received it.  As I was finishing my salad when my dinner plate was dropped off by another server. When I finished the salad, I realized that my dinner had mashed potatoes and not the baked one as I ordered, all the while, I received no additional service from my waitress.  Fed up, I walked to the unattended counter and made several attempts to gain the attention to someone by waving my arms to no avail. I finally spoke to the person who identified himself as the manager. I explained the situation and asked him if I looked like a customer, and if so, why was I being served poorly. He assured me that I was a customer and that the baked potato would be en route to my table shortly.  It was about this time that my waitress finally showed to my table and asked, \"how's your food?\" I asked her why had she had not delivered the honey mustard dressing and asked her to repeat what I originally ordered. She remembered my exact order, including the baked potato, with the side ranch dressing. I pointed to the mashed potato filled dinner plate in front of me and asked, \"what happened?\" No reply.  No reply? Ok, that's when I told her that it was apparent that she did not want a tip, and all she would do was stand there and look at me and give that \"you're stupid\" look, smile and with that condescending tone say, \"thank you.\" I finally got tired of her presence and told her to leave. When she wouldn't leave, I waived my hands to go away. And that's when I got the stupid remark of, \"you don't have to be rude.\"   Now, when the baked potato was finally served, it was on top of what appeared to be a small drink tray, and under the potato was a paper napkin. But still missing was the ranch dressing, which, once again, I had to go to the front counter to ask for it. By the time my order was completed and placed on the table, the rest of the meal was now cold, and ok at best.  During this time I noticed that my waitress was actively serving her other patrons, you know the \"I'm going to show that dude I'm a good waitress\" type of service? When I needed a refill, I literally waived my glass at her, each time she'd look toward me, smile, walk away, and never return. You know, she didn't even make it a point to notify anyone to refill my glass -- each time I had to walk to the counter and ask for the refill. At one point, I was being served by the woman at the front counter, and the waitress smirked.  I finally got tired, opted to leave, especially when the staff refused to ask if I wanted a \"to go box\" for the remaining food, nor a bill. I walked to the front counter to pay, and the cashier looked at me strangely; realizing that she was wondering why I wasn't handing her a bill, I told her that the waitress, nor any staff member had the courtesy of providing me with the bill. Here's when I realized how unimportant I was to the waitress.  The cashier attempted to find the bill on her cash register, and when she could not locate it, had to literally walk to the back to ask the waitress what I ordered. That's when I realized that the reason my order was incorrect, the waitress didn't do her job to notify the cook of my order, nor did she ever intend on providing proper service. But here's where it gets good. When the cashier obtained the bill, she literally tossed it at me. Wow, she didn't have the decency to place it in my hand. It was as if, \"just leave,\" which I did and won't be back.  And the tip? The name and author of a book on how to properly serve.",

My group of 7 showed up around 6pm on a Saturday evening and were sat nearly immediately, the restaurant was mostly empty.  They put us in a side room, which initially led me to believe it was going to be a very pleasant experience. Unfortunately, our server (Carley) was DREADFUL!   I'll save you the long drawn out story and just summarize it by saying:  1. Getting refills was nearly impossible, even when she acknowledged we needed them, she'd disappear for 5-10 minutes. 2. We ordered three bowls of soup but only two arrived, with the third finally coming a couple minutes before dinner. 3. It took almost 50 minutes from the time we sat down until dinner arrived. Including a 10 minute wait to order drinks.  4. After dinner was finally served, we didn't see the server again for 20 minutes. One of the orders was missing something. Too bad. We needed refills. Too bad. She couldn't have cared less whether we were enjoying our meal or needed anything.   Keep in mind, the restaurant was mostly empty. I have no idea what she was doing. Maybe prep work? I still gave her 15% (normally I give 20%) but she deserved $0.",

I ordered the salmon dish with crab and stuffed baked potato. My dish came with no crab and a weird glaze on the salmon. I corrected the waiter delivering it (not our waitress).. and he took it back to the kitchen. My waitress came back 15 minutes later with the same salmon, still no crab, now with a new sauce, and coconut shrimp. I let her know it was still not the right dish and she took it back a second time. Another 15 minutes, and the right dish is delivered...  Except.., they decided to use the same piece of salmon for all three dishes, baked on/wiped off 3 different sauces, and it was dry and the mix of a sweet glaze and lemon butter was awful.  As my family already had to wait for me, i finally gave up, sent it back again, and went without dinner.  I'm not a difficult customer and felt awful having my family have to wait for me. I had heard so many good things, I was so upset and embarrassed",

My waitress name was Cinthya and she was very rude. We came in to celebrate my daughter's birthday.   After we placed an order it took very long for them to bring out the food to us and it was another waitress that brought out the food and I asked politely if she could bring me some chipotle sauce and she never came around to doing that. Almost at the end of the meal I barley saw my server at all.        Then I went up to one of the other servers at the front and told them that it was my daughter's birthday and then a few minutes later my server Cinthya came to the table and questioned out loud in front of everyone at the table and asked \"is there someone's birthday at this table?\" very rudely. This was a surprise for my daughter from my husband and I and for her to ruin that was unbelievably frustrating. My husband responded for a no because it was meant to be a surprise so I corrected it that yes it was my daughter's birthday. A few minutes later she brought out a red velvet cupcake and she light the candle and just threw it on the table without having the courtesy to even wish my daughter a happy birthday.      Then we asked for a to-go boxes and bags, she brought out the boxes but not the bags then she disappeared off somewhere! If this is how Claim Jumper training their employees to treat their customers then mostly likely we will never return to Claim Jumper again.",

Not once we're we asked how any of our food was by the server nor the manager that brought it out to us. We ordered 2 appetizers, drinks and 2 steaks and neither my girlfriend nor I could choke down more than 3 bites. The only thing we finished was our wine and beer. Not once we're we asked why we didn't eat out pretzel, soup, or steaks. We finally tried to bring up our concerns with the lack of customer service and very disappointing dinner to the manager and she offered to take care of our steaks which we already paid for. I politely declined as she continued to offer a desert and jokingly says \"Well those aren't bland\".  2 hours, $100 down, and a near empty belly still. And to think I was more impressed by jack in the box on the way home!",

    "text": "When I lived in California, we would frequently go to the Claim Jumper and always looked foreword to the event.   Of course, that was many years ago and oh how things change!  I had the rib eye, I mean, I ordered the rib eye.   What I got, for $30.00, was one of the fattiest slabs of something that I would have never considered.   It was the 12 ounce cut, and more than 1/2 of that was pure fat.   It was like a slab of rib eye bacon.  Had to be the worst cut in the batch.   Two weeks before that, my wife prepared a rib eye from Costco that was simply the best steak I've ever had, and so foolishly, I believed the Claim Jumper could match the feat.   NOT EVEN CLOSE.  In addition, the print on the bill was so small that neither my wife nor I could not read it, and of course, we could not find anyone to read it to us.   As we were leaving, I tried to point this out to the host, and am absolutely certain that my concerns won't go beyond her ears.   It doesn't really matter though, as we absolutely, positively will not return.  I'll always remember the days when the Claim Jumper was a place we looked foreword to going to and that those days are long gone.",

They are drowning in BBQ sauce so everything else is pointless.  You could be eating packing styrofoam.  Atmosphere - the management let children run crazy through the restaurant and when  I asked the waiter, I was told there was nothing they could do for fear of being fired.  So instead, they poison the experience rather than ask the family to exert control over their children.  Appalling.  I ordered the salmon and it was very disappointing.  It was supposed to be cooked in lemon butter and the fish is old. All I tasted was the char on the grill.  My colleague ordered the jerk chicken on sweet potato.  Thankfully he asked for the honey on the side.  The chicken was peppered not jerked and peppered to the point of inedibility.  The restaurant is a 70's reject in desperate need of updating starting with the nasty menus and the ancient carpeting.",

It took forever to get anything, our poor waiter was overworked and we asked for bread and it came out at the end of dinner. My boyfriend asked for steak sauce three times. His steak was rare instead of medium and they did not include the mushroom and onions he asked for. It took 25 minutes for a manager to come speak to us and our waiter constantly told us he was getting us dessert and yet nothing. For the prices, this was absolutely ridiculous. On top of it, the food was nothing special. Definitely should not go.",

The server was okay, but must say, was keener on the men then the women, first mistake.  Ordered our dinners when everyone arrived, and the dinners did all come at the same time, which was a plus.  I ordered the chopped steak.  Chopped steak=giant hamburger patty.  Just need to clear that part up before I go on.  A well used NHL hockey puck would have been cooked less than the piece of meat I received.  I did send it back, asked for medium, and it was still verging on hockey puck.  I ate it any way. The burger I had at Red Robin a few days later was much better!) Second and third mistake.  My husband got the fish tacos, which he really enjoyed, so that is one good thing.    Since we had a large party,  each couple paid their bill,  Claim Jumper felt the need to tax on what they felt the gratuity should be.  On the receipt, the word, \"If agreeable\", appear.  We did not agree with the 18% gratuity, and paid less, but Claim Jumper charged our card with the suggested gratuity plus what my husband and I agreed upon.  Had to set this straight with my bank.  Not a happy camper with that one, and I somehow knew there was going to be an issue with the tab.    Not a good experience, and I don't think I will return any time soon.  Don't waste your time and money.",

Spinach artichoke dip had good flavor, but they served it with homemade tortilla chips that were salted and seasoned. Whose culinary expertise advised that? A salty chip takes everything away from the flavor of the dip, but Corbin understood and brought me bread very quickly......you know....the way it should be served. The Entree I picked was the RIBEYE with added bleu cheese and garlic butter, side Caesar, and triple cheese potato pancakes (upon recommendation). First, the Caesar  was good and I especially liked the homemade croutons. The rest left me unimpressed. The steak was a New York (lol or your cow was super skinny), it was cooked perfectly at med rare but it was tough and grainy (typical of sub par frozen meat), and they laid about a 1/4 cup of this bleu cheese butter on it (Bleu cheese is very strong and you don't need that much to accent a steak). A quarter of the steak was fat cap and silver skin.........really? The potato pancakes were miniature and fried in panko and very bland for being \"triple cheese.\" They have the prices of a high end restaurant but the culinary expertise of nothing close to that.",

    "text": "I would not recommend this restaurant to anybody.  Here is a copy of the email that I sent to the General Manager, Austin Walsh, on the business card that I was given when I asked for one that night. However, the manager on duty that night, Mr. Chris Luevano, was not good and we're thinking if this is the right card.  Dear Mr. or Ms. Walsh,  My husband has been trying to get in touch with you over the phone since September 30, 2017 and he has been told that you are out of town and will be out of town until October 07, 2017.  He called you, yesterday, October 09, and was told that you are still out of the office and will not be in for another week.  He did not leave a message to return his phone call in fear that you would not receive it.  Therefore, I am writing this email message to you in hopes that you will receive it.  The purpose of this message is to inform you of the terrible experience we encountered at your restaurant on September 29, 2017.  Every Friday, my husband and I go out to dinner; we like to try out different places but will, often, return to the restaurants we like.  WE WILL NOT BE RETURNING TO YOUR RESTAURANT!!!  Nor, will we be recommending your restaurant to any of my co-workers who, like us, have Friday night date nights.  I have been to Claim Jumper several times for lunch but not for dinner, so, I recommended Claim Jumper to my husband for dinner that night.  In all the \"Friday date night\" dinner we have had, dinner at your Claim Jumper was the worst dinner we have experienced.  WE sat in your lounge are for dinner because we wanted to enjoy your happy hour drinks.  We were able to order a bottle of wine and a glass of beer and an appetizer right away but after that our waitress, AMBER, did not return to take our dinner order until 25 minutes later (almost half an hour!).  My husband and I, both, ordered your BBQ Chicken Salad and, unless it is made different for dinner it tasted quite different from the same salad that is served at lunch.  There was hardly any BBQ sauce in the salad and this is my favorite part of your BBQ Chicken salad.  After ordering our main course, it took another half an hour to get our meal.  Without going into too much more detail, which I do not have the time to do in this email.  However, what really lead to my husband's phone calls and this message, is that we had an even more horrible time with your manager!  He gave us quite the attitude when we complained.  I asked for his name and did not understand the pronunciation with his last name and asked him to spell it, please, and boy did that upset him.  That's how I received your card, in which, he said he would write his name down.  Bottom line, would you wait 2 hours for a salad?  AND, we paid for the alcohol, the appetizer, and 1 salad after all of that!  I thought you would like to know that I will be placing my complaint on <a href=\"http://yelp.com\">yelp.com</a> and why.    10/13/207 - Additional comment:  Tonight's Friday date night dinner was at Cheddar's in Chandler, AZ and I give this restaurant a thumb's up for quickness of seating, service and the food was excellent!",

I was in town for work and a group of us moseyed across the street to try Claim Jumper upon recommendation from some local colleagues. It did not disappoint.  Although we had to wait, the wait was well worth it. I ordered the meatloaf, which was OUTSTANDING. The portions at this place are HUGE, which is right up my alley. My meatloaf came with a butter biscuit, and I shared a giant blueberry muffin and the tortilla soup with one of my coworkers. Everything was good. The blueberry muffin was moist and dusted in a brown sugar like substance that was decadent.  Oh, the potatoes. The mashed potatoes melted in your mouth. The meatloaf was doused in gravy, just the way I like it. I couldn't finish the giant two slices that was included. The grilled zucchini added a nice touch to the dish.  I can't write this without mentioning the beef ribs. One of my coworkers got them, and it was literally like a plate of food straight out of the Flintstones. They were bigger than my head! Huge bones, all beef ribs. I tried on and they were good. Real good.  Unfortunately, after gorging ourselves, we didn't have room for the 3 foot tall slice of chocolate cake, but it looked really good. Maybe next time. Definitely recommend Claim Jumper to anyone who loves good down home cooking.",

As we were being seated, I noticed a huge plate of Salmon at the table next to us, and knew right then what I wanted to order, it looked GREAT!  When our server Michael brought my plate to the table, I was disappointed to see the portion size of the Salmon was much less than I expected.  Both Michael and the manager Chris explained that portions are by weight not volume, and this was correctly served. BUT as a measure of good will, they gave me a second portion on the house.  I just can't say how much I appreciate their willingness to let me know my feelings mattered, and I didn't end up eating and leaving with a bad taste in my mouth (no pun intended : )  A note to the GM Mr. Austin Walsh: You've hired the perfect leader skilled in public relations in Chris.

If you have little ones, they give you a plate with applesauce, cheese sticks and something else  I can not remember.  It is just right for your 2 years and under, and it dose not cost.  They give that to the little ones instead of crackers.  It is a fun place to be  with your friends.  Three of you could share one meal and be full.  The servces is the best.  The dessert, all I can say is yummmmmmm.   Bring all your friends.  I been there with very larges partys.  You fill at home there. You like  to eat, then this is the place.  Enjoy.",

I like the BBQ turkey burger with the salt and pepper matchstick fries (nothing better than crispy thin fries that are super crunchy!).  The dessert is also ridiculously good and even better when you get a free slice of cake at your b-day lunch!  Due to all the fattening things on the menu that I love so dearly, Claim Jumper gets four stars.",

    "text": "This used to be one of my favorite restaurants.  Was there last night and nothing about it was appealing.  The service was slow and uneven and the food was way below its usual goodness.  To start, the fried zucchini appetizer was a massive file of about 16 spears of zucchini rolled in fresh parmesan cheese and served with honey mustard or ranch.  Now it was 8 pieces, in a pseudo-tempura batter with ranch.  Not impressive or good.  The California Citrus Chicken Salad was an entree portion.  However, it was served as an appetizer portion, which was ample, but not up to snuff.  The filet mignon was mediocre.  Nothing to write home about.  What killed me was the dessert, that I bragged about to my guests from out of town, which was the I Declair.  This was a luscious dessert of 3 scoops of french vanilla ice cream with a huge eclair built on top with lots of eclair cream, topped with a sauce made of chocolate and some kind of exotic liqueur surrounded by a mountain of whipped cream.  It was the dessert that dreams were made of.  No it was 2 oversized eclairs, dry and not much filling with a sauce that was a mixture of hershey syrup, some fudge and chocolate chips.  There were 3 tiny scoops of ice cream in the middle with a squirt of whipped cream.  We left most of it over.  Terrible!!!  People should be warned when they go to the Claim Jumper that if they were expecting the fabulous, large portions and great food, it no longer exists.  I am beyond sad.",

    "text": "We live in the area and this used to be our \"go to\" restaurant when we had guests in town. Not any more. We hadn't been back in a while and it was very disappointing this time. I understand this chain was bought out recently. It has definitely gone down hill since. I started with a one-star review but will concede to two because the food was edible. Though a tiny bit pricy for a casual restaurant, our experience was average at best. My chicken was obviously overcooked and very dry. The steak tips were fine. Though I didn't ask why, I did notice that one of our friends ate very little of here meatloaf. None of us ate our grilled vegetables as they were remarkably tough and tasteless. Though presentation isn't everything it is important when you've taken your guests somewhere... everything on the plates just looked messy. All this after the waitress flipped a glass of wine onto the table, onto our guests, their clothing, and purse. We realize this was an accident and a sincere apology would have sufficed but the waitresses comment was \"I've been doing this for two years and I've never done that before\". She seemed to think it was funny. Neither was she in any hurry to assist us cleaning up, she just stood there. We had to ask for extra napkins and a wet cloth to wipe wine off the ruined shirt and purse. I was thoroughly embarrassed to have brought people here and it goes without saying that I'll never do it again. My guess is that Claim Jumper is on it's way out. This area is crawling with restaurants so you've got to be competitive to stay in business. This one is clearly at the bottom of the pack now.",

But was so disapointed when we had lunch there yestereday. 1st of all the 2 items we ordered on their lunch menu was the same exact price as on their regular menu haha. That's no biggie but their food was horrible and what used to be large portions are now about 1/2 to 2/3 the size (depending on whats ordered) and no longer good. I had mozarella sticks which used to be a lot and yummy, soso now. The real dispaointment was the calmari. It tasted like it was sitting under a heat lamp forever. It was limp and soggie. I took it home and put it in the toaster oven and it tasted better than at the restaurant, yikes. Dh ordered their widow maker and it was seriously cold. The whole thing was just cold, not even luke warm, it was weird. They made him a new burger and comped us for it but the food over all was still just not good. My dds had the potato cheddar soup and they changed that recipe. It used to be my favorite soup ever, definitely not anymore :( We will not be going back there at all!!",

This time, we sat in the bar (a plus, since I'll do just about anything to avoid sitting near a family with a screaming 3 year old) and it was great. The service was VERY slow (knocking a star for that - albeit, it was very busy that night), but otherwise, the food was great, nice and tasty. They have a great happy hour menu with some killer deals on apps, and my favorite part is the decor. The Husband is very into rustic, and I like contemporary, and I think Claim Jumper hits right in the middle - almost like having dinner at my upscale cabin in Flagstaff.",

If you could get past the damp smell to stay The food (once we got it) was fine-  not great but not bad.  Kids meals were HUGE  which I suppose accounts for the giant price.  Service was absolutely horrible.  Even the manager just sat there and watched a woman scream repeatedly at her table mate in a fight they were having.   We will not be back",

I've been noticing that the times that I have ordered I have either had a miss order by them not sending out an appetizer or that the order was partially incorrect. While I was there they gave me a spicy chicken wings which I can't eat and the last time was he didn't bring the appetizers at all out to our table. The waiter did apologize and offered us a extremely huge chocolate cake to take home for free. That was a nice treat. But I must say the food is very good and Atmosphere is pleasant.",

The food is good,but my friend likes to go there all the time. I think It is a place you could visit once and awhile and be good with it. I have never had Desert here. But, they display them in the Showcase and they look amazing.  I should of taken a photo,but I did not. They have the largest slice of cake I have ever seen. From one of the Tallest cakes I have ever seen. It is decorated very Rustic, as if you are in a hunting lodge. It is very clean and parking is all around the building. So there is a lot. it is worth a visit. They are very friendly. The greeters in the front are very happy to see you.  I like it.",

And let me tell you we will just throw the gift card away... I wouldn't even give it to someone I care about. Worst service ever received from the moment we walked into the restaurant. It is 9:19pm we walk in and sit down at a table (it was open seating I'm guessing? Not sign or waitress stand). A waiter comes over and says they are already closed and that the door was locked. We walked right in the door was not locked obviously otherwise we wouldn't have been able to walk in. So I pull up yelp to see when they close and it says 9:30pm so I call him out and he says, \"well I did lock the door and we are short staffed so I closed up early but I'll get you guys started with some waters and tell the kitchen that more people have just come in and to stay open\". He made it seem as if we were the only people in there... there was three tables of people around where we decided to sit and they had food. So if they want more food that can't have it either?? We looked at each other and stood up before he could come back with the waters. Save your time and money and go anywhere but here.",

I have been to the Claim Jumper in Buena Park, CA, and the Claim Jumper on Baseline in Arizona and I am convinced that both restaurants over charge their patrons. The food was just okay, nothing special, just okay, but the prices were extremely high. A basket of fried zucchini's should not cost $9.99, especially when their batter didn't even adhere to the zucchini sticks. The chicken pot pie cost $17.95, outrageous! Even Marie Callender's frozen chicken pot pie from the freezer section is much better. Claim Jumper's chicken pot pie was not only dry and clumpy but there were hardly any mixed veggies in the pie. Oh yes, their drunk chicken for $22, was way over priced. We also had two large salads that was very tasty, but far from being large in size. In fact, the price was larger than the salad. I almost forgot, they took out their produce bar and added more tables, a big mistake. My family will never visit any Claim Jumper again.",

I've been to this location twice--once for dinner and the second time for happy hour.  When we went for dinner a few months ago I ordered the steak salad.  It was good and up to Claim Jumper standards.  This last visit my friend and I went for happy hour (which lasts until they close at 9:30!).  The happy hour menu items are \"small plates\" at various prices.  I had the street tacos and the Caesar salad--both very good.  My friend had the sliders and the fried zucchini sticks.  She liked both.  The thing about CUs is the food is consistent.  That's important to me.  Caution:  servings are HUGE, so come starving or be prepared to take 3/4ths of your meal home!",

    "text": "If this is the Claim Jumper by PHX (sorry, we aren't familiar with the area), we want to give a shout out to Courtney, our server. She was great!   Our hotel staff recommended a steak house on top of a hill. Rooster something? We initially went there. And it looked really cool. But it was 8 p.m. and there was a 90 minute wait. Uh, no. So, we did a quick search for other nearby steak places, and despite our vacation pledge to avoid chain restaurants, we ended up at a Claim Jumper.  But Courtney was worth it. We sat in the bar area and we waited for Happy Hour to start to order and get some half price appetizers (which was really funny as we watched the clock tick down with Courtney. But hey, saving money is saving money!). Hubby got the calamari and I got the soft pretzel. We both liked our choices. Hubby said his entree steak was really good and I liked my vegetarian wrap. I was so full from the pretzel, I could only eat half. I really appreciated that all the vegetarian options are gathered in one place on the menu. Makes ordering easy and clear.   By far, what we most enjoyed was Courtney. She was so upbeat, friendly and chatty. We like servers with personality! I hope her new kitten is a joy! It was a great start to our vacation. We kept talking over the next few days about how much fun we had with her. How often does THAT happen?? And she was a great server, too....very attentive, good recommendations, remembered special requests, explained the charges on the bill....  The food was really good, but our server was even better. Thanks!  (Our visit was April 22, 2017)  ETA: we never got the cheesy bread. Maybe they don't serve it in the bar? Or maybe not at that location? Not a complaint, just an observation.",

We ordered off of the lunch menu and still didn't finish all of our food. The portions here are a good size and they have a big selection. Their bread they serve with the meals was really soft. The food came out at a good pace.   My husband and I had the tri tip steak with coconut shrimp. I subbed out the mashed potatoes for a baked potato. It was so good. Not to mention a big potato. It was served with a creamy sweet butter. My daughter had the bacon burger. That thing was massive but she finished it off. One of my boys had the kid's sliders which came with fries and grape. My other son had mac n' cheese with fries and apple slices. The apples were really fresh and were served with caramel dip.  Our drinks were refilled without even asking. BIG Plus for thirsty patrons. We shared a pitcher of their CJ Red Ale. It was light and refreshing and went down without a fight. It paired nicely with our meat. We took a slice of mile high chocolate cake to go.   They also have a happy hour menu which is served at the bar. I highly recommend that. Also make sure to sign up for the Landry's Select Card to get your rewards points. It's good for several restaurants and attractions.",

Great for big groups, and they do offer a kids menu. This location has. Weird fly problem though! But every server we've had when coming here has always been nice. My favorite menu item is the Chinese chicken salad and the coconut shrimp.",

    "text": "We went here for dinner Sunday July 22nd. We were seated at the back of the restaurant a group of 9. It was uncomfortably warm back there and we had to pull the blinds because of the sun (no staff offered we did it ourselves) . Throughout our meal we kept smelling wafts of a fishy smell. 5 of the 9 of us kept smelling it, it was really bad. There were also at least 3 flies buzzing around and landing on our food. I walked up front to let the manager know of the warm area, the smell and the flies. He said he was sorry but did not offer anything , not even concern there were flies. We will never be back to this restaurant.  The food was adequate but a bit pricey and they ran out of the 12 oz porterhouse and my husband had his heart set on steak so said he would take the 16 oz. but asked our waiter if they might discount the $11.00 difference between the 2, we were told by the waiter \"no go\". Very poorly run restaurant. Dont waste your money. Wish we would have gone to the Black Bear diner close by. (update the next day) MY HUSBAND BROUGHT HIS LEFTOVER PORTION OF STEAK HOME AND PROMPTLY PUT IT IN THE REFRIGERATOR. HE JUST WARMED IT UP (LESS THAN 14 HOURS LATER) THIS STEAK IS ROTTEN!!! IT IS STINKING UP THE ENTIRE HOUSE. IT REMINDS ME OF THE FISHY SMELL WE WERE SMELLING AT THE RESTAURANT. PLEASE DO NOT EAT HERE UNLESS YOU HAVE A STOMACH MADE OF IRON LEST YOU RISK GETTING SICK.",

    "text": "Nope. So much nope. The manager has no idea how to run a floor properly. Our waitress was sweet but novice, little things missing like after the meal didn't ask the follow up question of, \"how was everything?\" The answer: AWFUL.  Country fried steak done very sloppy, meat slid around, it was COVERED in grease. Batter was a half cooked mess as if it was thrown in with other items, and not tended to properly. Wasn't battered well to begin with. Salad was a meager handful of finely chopped romaine/iceberg lettuce, shredded cheese, and tomato. That was it. I just spent two hours worth of my work's pay on greasy, measly, garbage.  To complete this story: our waitress was given a party of 8 and had to take drink orders while we waited 15 minutes for someone to take our check. THE MANAGER CAME TO THE TABLE BEHIND US! Took their drink order, never bothered to get the check from us (it was sticking out on the end of the table), and was later standing at the register just looking around aimlessly as we were leaving. Rather than cause a scene and tell her how bad the experience was, we left. Both of us were quite disappointed.",

We had to wait a good 30 minutes for our table. Our hostess finally called our name and brought us in the middle of the dining room and just left us there because she forgot what table. We stood there for a good minute waiting. Can you say awkward. Finally got our table and our server was pretty prompt in taking care of us.   We didn't order any appetizers cause we know the portions are huge. I ordered the chicken fried steak. Like I said it was huge but the only problem is that there wasn't enough gravy. Little dry and lots of breading. I wasn't too impressed. My wife had the fish and chips. The fish was pretty good. Crispy and tender. My son had a salad with his dinner but the salad looked really limp. So overall, the food was very disappointing. To top it off, we were so full and unimpressed that we didn't even order the Motherlode Chocolate cake. Now that's disappointing.   I would have to say the service was pretty good but the food is what made our experience disappointing. We'll have to see if we come back or not.",

I felt very uncomfortable with the whole meal, and the sort of snippy, arrogant, and condescending service.  I felt sick after my meal, and both my friend and I smelt a very strong fishy odor in the car from our leftover beef and pork.  Gross...Sick!  I can't believe I just spent over $35 for a meal that I did not enjoy at all.  What a waste.  I guess word is really getting around, as the place was almost empty on a Friday night.  The local Keg, Texas Roadhouse and Charlestons are always packed on Fridays, and are much better choices.  I will not be back, which is a shame, as I used to like this restaurant and would eat there often .  Got to go...the Claim Jumper meal is giving me bad stomach cramps.",

My fiance ordered the steak and bacon wrapped shrimp with a baked potato and it was amazing he said he ate everything which he never does lol!!!! But my dinner got really messed up.... I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich, I have celiac disease which the server knew when I told him I can't have gluten so ordered the gluten free bun with a side salad... My salad was really fresh but for my sandwich with a regular bun and fries on the side which I thought just came with it since I haven't been here in almost 9 years. Took a bite of the sandwich and immediately knew it wasn't gluten free and are half the fries thinking that since I told him I have celiac that the fries were ok well that was my mistake for doing that I are half the fries and got sick while still at dinner and couldn't even finish half my sandwich after he fixed my order..... He said sorry but had no idea what kinda hell I was/still am going thru and we still had to pay for my dinner and the manager was supposed to come talk to me and never did!!!!! They didn't seem to care that they messed me up and the server was even smiling a lot while he only said sorry until I told him I was sick then her looked concerned...... So WARNING if you have celiac triple check everything when you go here!!!!!! Because they won't care or do anything for you to even help with their mistake",

When the food arrived, each order was correct. That shouldn't be surprising but we had eight orders and many of them included substitutions and special requests. The server refreshed our drinks as needed and checked on us throughout the meal.  The food was very good. Comments from around the table: The pasta was firm with the right amount of sauce. The steak was cooked to order and delicious. The salad was fresh and not swimming in dressing. The chicken pot pie was huge.  The Three Cheese Potatocakes are worth a special trip!

That isn't an argument at all. Be prepared to have leftovers that will last you until the next rainy season, seriously. The prices are really expensive because you're not buying a meal, you're investing in a series of meals.   My problem the last time I came here was the service. The waitress was kind of rude and kept giving us dirty looks. Then when the food came out my mashed potatoes had gravy on them. The menu didn't say they came with gravy and she never asked me if I wanted gravy. I am physically incapable of eating gravy. Is it just me or is gravy the kind of thing you're supposed to ask if someone wants before just assuming? If it had been on the menu I would have asked for none. I was really sad about this because I love their mashed potatoes.   My mom ordered a piece of chocolate cake the size of a whale. I was both terrified and astounded by this beast. I don't eat chocolate but they all said it was great. I'll have to believe them.  I wish I could pick 3.5 but whatever.",

    "text": "The one thing I can say about this place is that it always delivers when you are really hungry. I was spending the day with my aunt and cousin so I wanted a place that had great food and plenty of it ( they like to eat to lol) and claim jumper was near by. I had not eaten here since the last time I ordered a widow maker burger and they almost had to cart my overstuffed body out the front door, but I knew I would be OK with backup in tow.   The place had the same decorations that I was used to (mining tools,carts) but it seemed to be missing something. Normally the place is packed but there seemed to be many open seats (was a Sunday afternoon after all). We were told by the greeter that it was open seating and that we could sit anywhere we wanted which was nice but kind of weird. The NBA playoffs were on near the bar so after deciding on a booth that allowed my cousin and I to view two T.V.'s we were greeted by our waiter. He gave my family the rundown since it was their first time here on how big the portions were but also informed them that they now also offered half portions as well. I was kind of bummed that I would not be able to get my glass of raspberry ice tea( they no longer serve it) but our waiter was quick to point out that they do serve a tropical ice tea which was really good.  After my aunt finally placed her order for a appetizer our server was off to the kitchen to place the order.   Now as I said in my last review when it comes to the food this place is top notch. The problem is with the staff as there seem to be many of them but none that are really interested in getting your food out in a timely manner. Our apps were on the table in what seemed like minutes which is not hard considering that it is probably already pre-made but our entries took over 30 minutes to come out! Not cool. But it did give us time to sit and watch the game. My cousin ordered the BBQ ribs which she said were smokey and really good. I decided to temp fate and ordered the widow maker with seasoned fries which looks like the burger version of the matter horn at disneyland. After the the normal looks of shock that newbies get when they eat here for the first time, we dug in. Each bite was delicious and flavorful. The bacon, and avocado worked better than Steve Nash and Amare in their game against the Trailblazers. Normally I switch back and forth between fries and my burger but this massive monster had me in it's grasp and would not let go.  All things considered this place still suffers from the same issues it did in the past. Anyone who knows me knows that bad service is a deal breaker when deciding if and when I will return to a place, but when it comes to eating here I guess I have to bend if not brake my own rule lol. Our server made this little family gorge fest a better one so I will return but just not right away. For now claim jumper you can keep all your stars but until the staff problem is fixed you are still in the danger zone.",

When we got there it was not that long to be seated but once seated at our table we waited like ten minutes till someone came over to greet us. We had plenty of time to decide on our whole order while we were waiting to be greeted. So we order drinks, appetizer, main meal all at once.  The appetizer came out in just a few minutes but it took longer till we got our drinks. For the appetizer we had the potato cakes, quite yummy.  It took well over 40 minutes from when we first placed our order till we got our main meal. Quite a long time for what was ordered. I enjoyed the parmesan chicken it was different but still very good.  Because we were too full for dessert but still wanted the have the huge chocolate cake, had to get it to go.  Overall good food and drinks, but terribly slow service. Some of the prices here are a little ridiculous, too.",

    "text": "I used to frequent Claim Jumper in Tempe at least a couple of times a month if not more. Over the last couple of months the quality of the food, the portion sizes, and the cooking itself have all deteriorated. But the prices have not gone down.  Tonight was it. I went with a family member to dinner. We ordered chicken tenderloins for an appetizer, which were barely done. I ordered a tri-tip dinner cooked medium (menu stated that only medium rare and medium were available). When I got my dinner it was rare, and I am being generous with that description. The waitress did not return until my family member, who said their food was good, completely finished their meal. Finally when the waitress came back I stated that the food was obviously undercooked. She stated \"I thought so, but I did put 'medium' down for your order.\" She asked if I wanted a manager, I just said that I will pay the check. Billed me for the entire dinner. When she came back after running my credit card she said, \"Hopefully you're experience next time will be better. Next time please let me know early and I will fix the problem.\" Kind of hard to do when you disappear for a long time after bringing the food. Still debating with myself whether or not I should have tipped, which I did.  As far as my \"experience next time\", won't happen.",

    "text": "This place drives me crazy in a good way.  The other night I went there for the second time.  Luckily, it was late and they were pretty slow so I was able to pour over the extensive menu at my leisure.  It also helped that I was with my mom who gave me this horrible trait of indecisiveness.  When I'm with my husband, he scans the menu titles and picks one.  I have to read every description and then narrow it down little by little until the waiter or waitress comes and I am forced to make a snap decision.    My mom was interested in the appetizers but since I had been here once before, I was able to talk her out of it.  All I had to do was remind her of the glorious desserts that were displayed when you first walked in.  Mom ordered the chicken fried steak and I ordered some mushroomy chicken delight!  It was served with mashed red potatoes, my fav, and I substituted parmesean zucchini spears for the roasted veggies and a biscuit the size of my fist!  We both agreed that the food was wonderful but saved 3/4 of it for the next day's meals and order dessert.  Ahhh, dessert!!!  The last time I was here, my hubby and I ordered the ice cream cookie sandwich and we couldn't get close to finishing it.  We almost cried as cookies are sacred!  This time, I ordered \"The World's Smallest Ice Cream Sundae\" which is a huge scoop of vanilla ice cream slathered with thick hot fudge and a mountain of whipped cream.  I ordered the chocolate chip toffee cookie on the side expecting just a cookie.  No, they brought the cookie out which is almost the size of the plate drizzled with carmel and chocolate.  I ate the ice cream and a few bites of cookie and brought the rest of the cookie home.  My mom ordered the creme brullee trio.  One was traditional, the other was something I can't remember and the BEST was the expresso chocolate!  Incredible!  Don't waste your time, money, or calories on the trio...just get the mocha!!  If you are a coffee freak, have a paramedic standing at your side for CPR...you'll have died and gone to heaven.  I will also support Kristin C's review:  bring your own Tupperware!",

At first I was worried about staying because the first girl wasn't that friendly and seemed to be a little mad and our food took a very long time. I then saw that they are scratch kitchen and took forever because my food was cooked from scratch and everything was hot and fresh. My Dish was the fresh cut carrots and the hot wings. I honestly have nothing bad to say and I hope Brent gets a promotion and John R. Because if it wasn't for the two of them I honestly would have never came back. Thanks guys!!!

Asian pear salad, veggie-burger, and most definitely the desserts. Upon walking in you are immediately pulled toward the massive chocolate cake. Massive. Humongous. I have never actually dared to order it. I am just too intimidated. Today I went with my parents and had the veggie burger. I am not usually an immitation meat kind of person, but despite the fact that this burger was, in fact, immitation meat, the rest of the goodies on the sandwich made for a delicious lunch. It came with onions, avocado, tomatoes, garlic mayo (it comes very light), and a few other things I can not recall. My mother had the citrus salad with chicken, which she loves, and my father had the Chinese Chicken salad. Both came with big muffins. My favorite is the cornbread muffin. The only dessert I have actually indulged in is the deep dish berry pie. The pie was tart and a little tangy, which was wonderfull. It was not overly sugary. Perfect for sharing. Other desserts I have been eyeing for multiple years are the red velvet cupcakes, the flan, the humongoid eclair, the chocolate cake, and the deep dish apple pie. I'm sure there are a few I am forgetting. The prices are reasonable, especially since you are most likely going to be sharing or taking home half of the meal anyway.",

I'm highly allergic to eggs, so when I order something I always request that they check with the chef first to ensure I'll be safe. I ordered one of their Widow Maker burgers during happy hour and twice asked the waiter about the egg issue. He assured me it was fine. When it came, it had a sauce that looked suspiciously like mayonnaise. When he went back to the kitchen, he must have asked the dish washer about the eggs, because he came back and said \"All OK\" and I dove in. Within three minutes, I was in the restroom choking. It was LOADED with eggs. When you are in business to serve people food and you can't get your kitchen to prepare something without eggs, that's a sad state of affairs. The boss was called over, a guy named Paul, and he basically did nothing. We left with a $20 bill and sick as a dog. The food my partner had was served luke warm and was marginal at best. This is not a quality establishment, for sure!",
