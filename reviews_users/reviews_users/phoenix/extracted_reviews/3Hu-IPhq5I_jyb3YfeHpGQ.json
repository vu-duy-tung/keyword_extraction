The flavor, execution, prices, and customer service easily exceed those offered by its predecessor, Paradise Bakery.  Wildflower has earned my regular patronage and allegiance and here are the primary reasons why.  - Reasonably priced and incredibly tasty menu.  Great dishes such as butternut squash ravoili, salmon alfredo, veggie sandwich.   - Perfect place to help mitigate my guilt when I feel like I've eaten too many burritos or burgers. - Free Wifi. - Great breakfast menu. (Yogurt Berry Parfait is in a parfait class all its own) - Very accommodating staff.  They aim to please and it shows in their appearance, demeanor, and efforts to accommodate any special requests you might have.",

    "text": "Oh.... Wildflower. If I could marry you I would, but my fiance would...not...approve....  Where do I start? Everything about Wildflower is awesome. Every location I ever have been to, has been SO CONSISTENT, it is unreal. I can go to the location out in Prescott and enjoy the same friendly service and amazing food that they offer at this awesome location (I chose this one because its closer to me). I finally realize its becoming a chain, but they haven't sacrificed any quality since their expansion.   I can't really recommend anything specifically on the menu, it is all so damn good. Really, I can't, and yes I know this is a review so I should have an opinion....Ok, honestly, I guess if you break my wrist for some more info I see their breakfast as the strongest portion of the menu, but I could be off when I make this assumption. I love the pancakes the most.   Random, right? : Pancakes....simple, easy, I could make them at home (lies...I'd burn them). They have a banana nut pancake which is tubular (1 point for Jefe for the usage of tubular). I have had a lot on each menu, but the options for breakfast out-class most eateries in town. Even the bathrooms are clean and friendly....yes, I just jumped from pancakes to bathrooms. Deal with it.  Come here and enjoy the food, no matter what time of the day. You will not be disappointed.",

We ate there, had some soups, sandwiches, and I thought, \"Wow, Sedona's gotten pretty corporate since I was last here, but at least they have this good indie soup/salad/sandwich place that I'll have to come back and eat at again.\"  Heh.  Little did I know Wildflowers were a chain that permeated the state's landscape, as evidenced by all these Yelp reviews. Since my lazy ass made it to Changing Hands only one time so far in my lifetime, I resigned myself to thinking I wasn't going to eat another WF sandwich for an eon or two.  And lo, one just happens to open up on Indian School. Convenient, I'd say.  Granted, with it and Pita Jungle open, along with Rumbi Island Grill and Pei Wei all in the same strip mall, the parking lot at dinner time can get a little chaotic, but it's still worth it.   Great sandwiches (which come with complimentary bread/roasted tomato salad on the side), soups and salads. Can't vouch for the pasta or the sweet stuff since I haven't had any yet. I have seen a few folks while away their time with their laptop (free wireless) long after their meal was over. Yet, no pissy-ass waiter hinting at them to leave. That's good to see.   Communal newspaper reading area in the middle, plenty of booths, mellow crowd (at least the few times I've eaten there). They do get a little out of control with the bean sprouts in their sandwiches, but at least you know the first time so they don't keep doing it over and over again.   All in all, for a casual soup & sandwich place, I'd say this joint is doing just fine.",

Enter the large doors place your order take a seat and somebody will bring your food to you. This is a very popular place with people of all ages.

I can't speak to the bread, other than what comes with the salad (I'm trying to cut out bread). The bread that comes with this salad is particularly hard and I don't like that in bread...  They have sandwiches and various salads, and breads and pastries. I'd try not to come during typical eating times because you may not have a place to sit.",

    "text": "Today I drove 20 miles to reach this location, I was interested in trying out some if the bread but I had my heart and mind set in the Mushroom Kale Soup. Counter gal was very helpful in the bread dept. giving me a sample of the flavor I was looking to buy. When My soup came up, another gal was calling out 'Fan, Fan and no one answered..finally the gal that helped me asked are you calling out Fran ( my name)? And the lady just said Fan , Fran and looking lost! Well I have to take some fault in the fact that I didn't check my soup order, it's 1 pm on a Thursday and not many orders coming out of the kitchen..and I did tip the counter girl so I just went in my way...drove back 20 miles and got home to find out I got some spicy vegetable soup! How can someone screw up one small cup of soup on a slow afternoon? Maybe they were out and didn't have the courage to tell me or maybe my $10.00 loaf of bread and $5.00 cup of soup purchase doesn't warrant them caring about it... I call the gal and she asked my name and had no problem offering me a 12.00 gift card to make up for the problem..almost as if they have to offer it on a regular basis! I told her that I wasn't going to drive all that way ( gas being what it is) for what would be a few bucks-I said  I wanted to let her know so that someone in charge could fix their lousy setup for takeout orders..so a word to the wise...check your order cuz it really does take a rocket scientist to get it right there",

They helped us pick out the bagels to get and were very accommodating.   Flash forward to this morning, we were in a hurry and the manager had no record of our order. I was a little miffed, and it could have turned into a bad experience. Instead, the manager gave my husband and myself free drinks, got our order together in five minutes, gave us a (delicious!) free scone and we were on our merry way. A mistake turned into a positive experience. Woohoo!",

It's always busy around lunch time and the parking is horrible so you have to time it right.   I'm waiting for the day they start serving their afternoon pastas for lunch!

They no longer have some of the favorites such as french onion soup they rarely have broccoli cheddar and if they do have it it seems to have pureed broccoli in instead pieces of broccoli as it did before. Going along with the quality of the food served there's also been a quality of the service that has also gone downhill with the food. Their service used to be much better as did the food I would definitely not recommend going and wasting your money there on brand tasteless food.",

I miss your lemon penne dearly and rarely come back because you don't have that or the fruit tart anymore) its for what happened while my family and I popped in, or lack there of, that has me puzzled, and really grossed out.  Let me start by saying we are animal lovers. We have several pets of our own. They do not however, accompany us to restaurants.  Why am I starting my review off with that? Keep reading. We were sitting in the second to last booth (near the second, east-most exit) enjoying a quick meal. All of a sudden, my husbands eyes got very large. A man, who was walking his CAT, was proceeding to come inside with said cat. It was not in a carrier of any kind, it did not have a service vest or tag of any kind, just a leash. He proceeded to pick the cat up, and set it down in the booth. Yes, you read that right. His cat. It was black.   The cat was freaking out, so you can go and check for the scratches on your booth for yourself if you don't believe me. Based on what we heard, he used it several times as his scratching post.   What shocked me, is that everyone in the restaurant saw this happen, including some employees I am quite sure, and no one said anything! This is against health code...right? My husband and son are both highly allergic to cats. We waited for about 10 minutes before we completely lost our appetites and left. Another customer even asked my husband if that was in fact, a cat, the man had walked in with.   As we left, I confirmed it was indeed a cat, as it was sitting on the seat of the booth, next to the man.   Your food is good, but not that good. We will opt for another location next time. Ick!",

    "text": "This is a decent neighborhood eatery with average salads, soups, sandwiches, pastas, and baked goods. Some things are delicious and some things aren't good at all, it is kind of hit or miss. When Wildflower first opened it was clean and inviting, but it has gone downhill recently. The staff is always very friendly and willing to go the extra mile to accommodate your needs, and the food comes out quickly. They have different soups on different days, so check online before you go if soup is what you are craving. I am a French onion soup connoisseur and was excited to see it on the menu...sadly it had no flavor, the cheese was not melted, and it just left me wanting to fulfill my craving elsewhere. However, they do have incredible cream and cheese based soups; the potato is great! Their sandwiches are average, but they do offer some unique hot subs that are worth trying. They even have a vegetarian option. The pastas are ok; really if you want pasta I suggest going somewhere where they make it fresh and don't just boil up a box of noodles. The salads are where they shine though. They have every topping you can think of, and an customize the salad based on what your preferences are. I have never been disappointed with a salad; it is always crisp and fresh, and the ingredients are creative as well. As for the baked goods I suggest the scones and breads, especially the chocolate chip scone!   If you are looking for a quick and easy meal then this is a good place to go. Wildflower is also a good option for take out as well. The atmosphere is quiet and a good place to meet for lunch or even meet someone for a business meeting.",

Two noteworthy comments:  1) This particular WFB is very spacious and clean, especially when compared to the cramped and fly-infested Tempe location. Perfect for book clubs or low-key family gatherings.  2) If you order anything with sauce, prepare yourself to be buried in it. With some dishes, it's almost like being served a soup!",

His quick response and full message sent to me WAS a \"WOW\" EXPERIENCE! Hats off to an owner of a big-chain restaurant that truly cares about his customers. Since my original post, I have been back several times and couldn't be happier with my visits and food. I highly recommend this place,  especially for breakfast on a weekend without having to deal with the hour plus wait times you encounter at so many  other places. Thank you Wildflower for doing the right thing, it makes a difference!",

Great menu selection, more versatile and healthy than Panera.  I went with the Caesar salad and added on salmon.. To add it on, I believe the cost was $2-3 which is almost unheard of. Once I got my salad, I realized why the salmon was priced that way as it wasn't actually grilled fresh in the back, but rather was cooked at an earlier time, refrigerated and then put on the salad cold. I was kinda of bummed, because I feel that it really lacked flavor.   Other than that, the salad was great.. Great food for the price and I felt it was of the same quality that you'd find at a more up-scale restaurant.   I was the only patron on the patio and really appreciated the staff's attentiveness in coming out to make sure I was enjoying my meal and checking if I needed anything else.",

I've also had the chicken salad sandwich, which was tasty but just too large to take a bite of so I ended up having to eat it with a knife and fork. I also noticed the lettuce on my sandwich was browning at the top so I skipped eating that part of the lettuce. I also think the food is overpriced and it takes a while for the food to come out.  It's a nice place to meet up with people and enjoy their company but I can't give it more than 3 stars.",

So it was my first time here and was recommended the chopped salad, it was a tasty suggestion but the salad was super small for how much I was paying for it and had hardly and salmon on it, but oh my gosh the dressing was super amazing!!! I also ordered 3 desserts the brownie, chocolate cake, and the coconut cake they weren't sweet but they had a lot of different flavors going on in each one of them which was a little overwhelming. Overall I'm feeling a good sense of satisfaction in the foodI'll probably be back to try a couple different salads.",

They need to tone down the weirdness of their ingredient combos and that slaw crap they give you is just atrocious.\"  LOL   Potato Cream Cheese soup - YUM!  So Yum in fact that on my first visit, T ate a good portion of my soup.  Kid tested recipe!  :)    Emerald Spinach salad - Very tasty!!! spinach, gorgonzola, bacon, red onion, spicy pecans, oranges, strawberries and red grapes with Balsamic Vinaigrette   Their bread is almost a little too crusty for me, but its still good.

I liked getting to-go food here because the food is good for the price and because the place operated like clockwork. No matter what it was 10-15 minutes for my order, the food was solid, and the staff was always on top of things.  This location has done a 180. Orders consistently take 20-30+ minutes, to-go orders aren't always correct and the staff is just wandering aimlessly; both managers and hourly staff. This place could best be described as a ship without a captain. There's not enough people taking orders, food sits in the window with no one taking it out, to-go orders get ignored in the window; it's always a mess and no one seems to care and/or know what to do.  Since I come here on a regular basis I'd like to see things improve and I went so far as to email the company--something I never do-- and the CEO himself replied and acknowledged that they were aware of issues at the Arcadia location and were working on it. That was 3-4 months ago and things are just as bad.  I'm moving out of the neighborhood so it doesn't really matter to me anymore what happens here, but hopefully they turn it around for their sake.",

Taking a leaf (ha!) out of Cowboy Ciao's playbook, Wildflower created a sumptuous version that mirrors, not copies, the salad so famous it has it's own Facebook page. Seriously. <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.facebook.com%2FTheOriginalChoppedSalad&s=16ef6ac7030348b87319fc9328d098a9ffe8e99a4c6237dddf0a23c2dd366d89\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">facebook.com/TheOriginal...</a>    I've had the original and agree it's divine, but in the showdown of similarly named salads, my pick is the Chopped Salad from Wildflower and here's why:   1. Price. At under $8, I can (and do!) eat this salad weekly without worrying about my wallet. The Original Chopped Salad is a whopping $12.   2. Convenience: With multiple Wildflower locations, I can cave into my craving for this salad for lunch or dinner while in Phoenix or Gilbert or Scottsdale or wherever.   3. Size: In this case, size does matter and the Chopped Salad from Wildflower seems almost twice the size of the Original Chopped Salad.   In the battle of chopped salads, I declare Wildflower the winner!   You can get the recipe here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.azfamily.com%2Fcommunity%2Fblogs%2Farizona-cooking%2FHave-you-tried-Arizonas-State-Salad-231931881.html&s=7cac647454a1bea6c386574a4bd07b78030721245132f60273ab3751273c62fb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">azfamily.com/community/b...</a>",

It's your standard Wildflower Bread Company, and  If you've never eaten at this chain, you should. A lot of healthy and tasty options, very friendly staff, and a great selection of teas too. I love their peppermint teas, and it's nice to see that they have Stevia on their coffee condiments counter. Fantastic salads and sandwiches, ideal for a casual meal.  They can make anything vegetarian too, so it's perfect for me. They have plenty of seating, and the WiFi is very reliable, so if you just want to have coffee, and chill. It's a perfect spot since they also have plenty of parking space.",

When the waiter brought the breakfast to our table, he was laughing, put the plate in front of my husband and started to walk away. We sent the potatoes back but the jokes on them. ...We and our friends will not be going back. There just are too many great choices in the area to be treated so poorly.",

Last night at the Yelp party, I tried their roasted sweet potatoe and was craving it, so I ordered the roast sweet potatoe sandwich tonight with the potato cream cheese soup. I never order anything vegetarian ever but that sandwich sounded so good and it did not disappoint at all! The sandwich had roasted sweet potatoes, tomatoes, arugula, fennel, fig jam, goat cheese  and a balsamic vinaigrette on focaccia. The tartness of the goat cheese balanced the sweetness of the fig jam and the nuttiness of the arugula. Everything went so well with the roasted sweet potatoe and the herb focaccia. I would seriously order this every time and not be upset that there was no meat on it. The potatoe cream cheese soup was good. It was creamy with a thinner texture to it. It had teeny tiny bits of potatoes in it. I wish it had bigger chunks in it. I don't know if it normally has larger pieces in it and I just got the end of the pot since I came at closing.   I was eyeballing all the dessert options and decided to forgo since I'm trying to cut back on the sugar, but they looked so scrumptious! Especially, the old fashion toffee pie! OMG. In hindsight I should have just ordered it and cut the sugar tomorrow!",

She said they didn't have any decaf today and asked me if I'd like a refund on my coffee. I said yes it never saw her again.  The food at wildflower for breakfast is marginal at best.

And they have bread...enough bread to fulfill every carb lovers wildest dreams. One complaint: Please get rid of the nasty tomato-bread gunge that comes with the sandwiches. It looks like bird regurgitation. It's as if Wildflower said, \"What should we do with all this leftover bread? I know! let's mash it up, add some tomato flavor to it and present it as if it were a salad.\" Kudos to the samples of lotion in the ladie's bathroom however. A very nice touch.",

Service is brisk when you order a cook-to-order item: order at the counter, sit down with a color-coded table sign, and a serviceperson delivers the food to your table in minutes.  I haven't noticed a big lag in wait time, even at peak hours.   Best of all, because of the quasi-fast food setup, it's a setting you can feel comfortable dining in whether alone or with a group of friends.

I had been having bad experiences (mostly with rude, poor, or non-existent service) at this specific location for awhile so I stopped going all together for a few months. I finally went back for some soup when I was sick and the service had made a remarkable turn around. Everyone was polite, the food was prompt and at top quality.   Then I went today and they're back to their ways. Obviously couldn't count on the good service lasting too long. The guy who took my order either got it wrong or the person preparing the food disregarded it. I waited for my food for longer than I would have expected and when it didn't come I had to track someone down to ask to check on it. They had it sitting behind the counter. I asked how long it had been there and they replied \"6 minutes\".I asked why they hadn't called my name and he shrugged and walked away. By the time I got home my soup was lukewarm and my sandwich was soggy which makes me think the 6 minute time the food was sitting there was probably much more. The sandwich was also not prepared the way I had ordered it.   Awhile ago, they would include a card in your to-go orders that said who prepared them and if they got it wrong, instructed you to call in (this may have been at a different Wildflower Bread Company location). I have to guess the reason this location doesn't use them is because their phone would never stop ringing. I'm incredibly disappointed.",

Told them it was ok and that I would eat them, mostly because I didn't want to wait another 30 minutes for my food. Luckily I'm not allergic to nuts, but this mistake could have been deadly for someone else. Manager came over and gave me a gift card because she felt bad. I'm not sure what has happened to this location, the staff doesn't seem motivated, the manager seems to have no control over the food or her staff.

    "text": "Went back to Arcadia's Wildflower Bread Company today for a farewell lunch for a coworker.  I started Weight Watchers on Sunday, so I prepared by going to the Wildflower website and calculating the \"points\" from their nutrition pages.  Thanks, Wildflower, for making that info available.  But, Holy Cats!  My friend had urged me to try their salads, which she loves.  The two salads for which I calculated \"points\" totalled 22 and 23 points.  My daily total is 29 points.  And salad is not great as a leftover.  I ended up with the vegetarian lentil soup.  I could eat the bread with butter and my total was still only 11 points.  Plus, I tried a new soup and am now a big fan of the tasty veggie lentil.  Parking was once again a challenge, but I was on my motor scooter, which enables me to improvise parking.",

    "text": "A long time customer turned away by a horrible experience,  As frequent diner, we visit a number of local restaurants.  Wildflower is down the street and we were weekly regulars until now.  The chopped salad was ordered and due to a lack of staff, we then proceeded to bus our own table. This is not unusual.  The salad arrived with a distinct shortage of lettuce.  We asked the server to alert the manager.  Rather than solve the problem, the manager sent over another employee with a bowl of lettuce.  He made  number of comments from \"that's what you get\" to \"they were cutting the portions\" to \"your wife got your lettuce\".  REALLY!!!!  When asked if this how management was trained, he stated that he wasn't the manager.  We again asked for the manager who after a long spell told us she was busy on the phone.  Unfortunatley, we had observed the entire time and knew this was False.  The reality is she simply sent over worker who was untrained, which follows with the lack of staff to bus tables, the lack of experienced kitchen help to prepare food and the poor management.  So, if you don't mind making your own lunch, busing your own table and then paying for the privilege of doing so, Wildflower is for you.  There are better dining options in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "This is definitely comparable to Paradise Bakery or Panera Bread, except that it's not a national chain (just Phoenix), which is always nice to patronize. But it's also a bit better. I go to Panera Breads in various parts of the country to use their free wifi (which is also available here at Wildflower), but rarely actually eat there because it's just not that good. Paradise is just gross most of the time, and I'll only eat there if I have a coupon. Where Wildflower separates itself from these places is the quality of the food: it's pretty good. The mass of sweets conveniently laid out at the entrance leads you to believe this right away. There are some great-looking cakes and breads, and they have some wonderful looking cinnamon rolls. But you're probably going for the breakfast. The nice thing about this place, tucked back into a newer strip mall on Indian School west of 44th, is that it shares its parking lot with a primarily dinner restaurant and a Cold Stone, both of which are not likely to be crowded at breakfast time. And this leaves plenty of parking in an otherwise relatively small lot. The place is busy and full of kids. There are booths on the walls, big tables in the middle, a small sidewalk patio outside and a big, round table in the middle of it all, strewn with newspapers and magazines. It's comfortable, although a bit frantic and noisy. I had the sausage and egg sandwich and a side of home fries, although you shouldn't believe for a second that it was simply a sausage and egg sandwich. It was more of a sausage omelet sandwich, as, mixed in with the eggs were cheese, green onions and red peppers, all on a ciabatta roll. It was nice for what it was, but I will say that I was disappointed by the sausage, which was definitely frozen and a little lifeless. The home fries were good, but overpriced: the tiny plate cost me $2. But I got approximately 1/2 red potato lightly fried (not greasy in the least) loaded with rosemary and possibly a little garlic. Very good. My companion had the ham and egg sandwich which, unfortunately, was exactly that: ham and eggs. To be fair, the ham was very good and had an excellent flavor, but it was just dull compared to my sandwich. And especially compared to some of the other options. Honey-Cured Ham & Brie Frittata? Feta & Roasted Vegetable Frittata? Yum! Then there were also interesting sounding pancakes and a french toast option. Very nice! Not much of a service place. You order up front and your food is brought to you. You're then left alone. I asked for ketchup and tabasco for my home fries, and was told that I couldn't get my own but that it would be brought to me. It never came, but that was fine, because I ended not needing them. I also take issue with the fact that they call theirs a \"homestyle\" breakfast. I'm not sure from which home they came, but, at my house, we did not cook breakfasts which involved brie, roasted tomato or lemon ricotta. Maybe I was disadvantaged, but I think of \"homestyle\" as simple eggs, bacon, toast and maybe some sort of potato or biscuit dish. It's not a bad thing to not be served a mound of greasy, homestyle goodness on a morning when I would rather eat otherwise, but I feel that it's misleading to refer to this as such. Also, for Tucsonans, this is completely unrelated to the \"Wildflower\" there, but that becomes very obvious as soon as you see this place.",

We're lucky to have both in abundance in our little burg.  My usual sandwich orders are the turkey and brie and the roast beef and gorgonzola - with the latter being my favorite.  I'm not a fan of the tomato bread salad that comes with each sandwich though.  It seems like they don't know what else to do with left-over bread so they concoct some kind of soggy salad out of old bread to use as fillers for the sandwich dishes.  NOT a fan.  The pasta is pretty good.  I usually get the pesto linguini with chicken, and always end taking left-overs home.  If you're there early enough, their breakfast ain't bad either.  The ham, egg and swiss sandwich is decent and comes on a tasty ciabatta roll.  If you fly solo - no fear- you've got the newspaper-filled round table to sit, veg out and read.  Isolated incident.  But once when we were eating out on the patio we got solicited by a drunk hobo who was on the verge of passing out.  Gosh.  He could have at least shared his liquor....",

Two suggestions to get people like me to visit more  1)  prices are kinda expensive. I know its quality and youre a local biz but I would love to have some lower priced options so I can spend $10max for lunch.  Or 2)   Give us a frequent visitor card to encourage us to visit more frequently and aappreciate the value. Paradise Bakery which is direct competition but not as tasty (and coffee is way worse at PB) has a fantastic program which gets me (and other friends, biz owners) to visit.   Id also give a 5 star review if you addes a program such as (buy 10 coffees, get 1 free or buy 8 lunches, get one free).",

As anyone who eats with me often knows (and as you can probably tell from my reviews), I tend to prefer vegetarian lunch options than meat ones. Even though I'm not a vegetarian, I'm picky about meat quality and I often don't think meat adds much to sandwiches, so I tend to stick to sandwiches with roasted vegetables and cheese or a pita with hummus/falafel.   Anyway, I had already tried the roasted sweet potato sandwich at Wildflower - although the fig confit was a bit too sweet for me, it definitely went well with the mozzarella and the sweet potato. Then, last week at work, I tried the Portabello Picnic (roasted portobello, zucchini, eggplant, roma tomato, arugula and herb goat cheese on grilled Pasilla Chili Rye) and thought it was really, really good. Often, restaurants totally overcook portabellos and eggplant but this portobello, eggplant, and zucchini was tender (but not mushy) and tasted perfectly fresh. The herb goat cheese and slightly savory rye bread complemented each other and provided the perfect finishes to the delicious roasted vegetables. Loved every bite!  Even if you're not a vegetarian, I think you will find this sandwich hearty and satisfying.",

    "text": "This is a chain, but not all chains have to be bad news. They're Arizona-based, so if you live here, why not patronize their business? The money is still staying in your state. Most chains are bad news and grace the armpits of major cities like rampant pubic lice (also known as \"strip mall Hells\"), but these guys might restore your faith in that all-too-often abused model, a little.  Somehow, though, they still reminded me a bit of a tiny Souplantation where the food is brought to you and the menu is innovative. It's probably just the pale wood interior and glass sneeze guards. But these people are reviving the ancient art of breadmaking and turning it into something trendy and accessible to people who don't eat at anything but chains. ( I saw a picture of someone making bread in a book in an antique shop once.) They need at least some kudos for this.   On to my meal: the Caribbean Jerk chicken salad is pretty darned good. I didn't find it spicy enough, and I would have put fresh thyme, some shallots, scotch bonnet peppers, and the tiniest breath of allspice in it, but I did field research in the Caribbean and know how that stuff is supposed to taste. This was the first Caribbean jerk anything that I've ordered on any menu and didn't find deeply disappointing. The size of the salad was perfect--not too big (salads don't keep well as leftovers), and not too small (it was sufficiently filling and I'm 6'3\"). The pieces of nondescript bread on the side were homemade, so how could I complain?  My wife's roast beef with gorgonzola cheese was gone before I could demand my own bite. Her little sister's roasted sweet potato sandwich (carb-on-carb seemed redundant, but what else can vegetarians really eat?) was also much appreciated by the little sis, and was gone before I could bully the slightest smidgen out of her. There wasn't much service, but it was fast; the atmosphere was industrial, but I saw a lot of cool combinations of ingredients.   I would have liked to have seen less of a \"we're trying to make mega bank and stick only to things we know we do well\" atmosphere, but a chain is a chain to some degree. There are also very few items for people with gluten allergies or who can't eat bread. But for lunch on a Sunday afternoon in strip mall Hell, this place was more than adequate, earning it an \"A-OK\" rating of three stars. Most chains have a repulsive formula, but this chain's formula is far less odious than most.",

    "text": "The heart of Wildflower is its bakery, and it seems like the restaurant sprung from that. Their menu is wide-reaching, with anything from scones to fritattas, roast beef sandwiches to smoked salmon alfredo.   I have been partial to the pasta, but have heard solid reviews of the breakfasts and sanwiches, as well. It is essentially comfort food at its most basic level, and they don't do much to rock the boat beyond that.   It is at the same time my critique and my endorsement of Wildflower that they stay so True to comfort food recipes. Part of me would like to see something a little more adventurous and innovative, but further consideration makes me concede that my favorite aspect here is that you know what to expect when you order. The food is fresh and fast and the service is good, without much deviation from their traditional ingredients.",

    "text": "Decided to stop in here after a late evening run to the post office on Van Buren. Don't know if it was the time I was there (8:00 PM on a Monday) or the weather (storm coming in) but there weren't very many people dining...which was extremely nice.   Very laid back, very quiet, very relaxing. I have been here before on weekend mornings when it's packed (still enjoyable though) and being able to see it in 'down-time' mode made me enjoy it even more.  Ordered the lemon penne pasta...something that's always caught my eye on the dinner menu but never tried. And one of their passion fruit iced teas to drink. You order at the counter, they give you a sign to put on your table, then bring the food out to you.   Got my iced tea at the self-serve beverage center and made my way to a table. A few tables seemed a little messy but there was an employee busing and cleaning them. Wildflower seems to be one of those 'leave it...we'll clean it up for you' places.   My pasta was brought out to me in a few minutes...by that time I had my laptop set up. One of the best things about Wildflower is they have TWO outlets at each booth for laptops....and free wi-fi. A quiet evening, internet, and pasta....what could be better?  The lemon penne pasta was wonderful.....penne pasta, spinach, and tomatoes in a lemon cream sauce  topped off with some fresh lemon wheels and a little mozzarella ball. Very lemony...you gotta' like lemon to enjoy it. It is served with some of their bread which was hearty and crusty...a perfect compliment to the tartness of the lemon cream sauce.  I didn't opt for dessert this time...all though I have in the past. Their toffee torte is pretty darn good. The desserts and baked goods are all prominently displayed next to the counter where you order so you can 'save room' for them I'm sure.  One more thing....I'm not much of a coffee person. Yeah, I'll have coffee but it all just kind of tastes the same to me....coffee is coffee is coffee. But for some reason when I've had their coffee on weekend mornings it just tastes AWESOME. Can't quite remember if it's called 'house blend' or 'morning blend' or something like that...but it's good. It's the only coffee where I can tell a difference.   Just a very enjoyable dining experience.",

There was no line, plenty of tables, none of the children others have commented about and a very pleasant group of diners.  The menu choices were impressive - it wasn't hard to find something to eat for breakfast at 11:30am. I ordered the Feta & Roasted Veggie Frittata without the feta. It arrived so fast, I didn't have time to open the paper I brought to read. The potatoes were delish, not greasy (at least not greasy to me) and the bread was wonderful. Okay, I don't have bread very often (or potatoes), so I really enjoy it when I do indulge. When I ate the eggs, I realized how much better free range eggs taste and need to go bump up my rating for Matt's Big Breakfast. What a difference in the quality of eggs. The roasted veggies were good. Overall, very satisfying.  I bought a pretzel for later and it was yummy too.  I would definitely go back.",

However, what made this location stand out was the service. Frank, who I believe is the manager, was particularly attentive.

They've literally got something for everyone.  Their food is fresh, service is fast, and the options are endless. From salads, to sandwiches, to pastas, and delicious soups. One of my favorite things about Wildflower is that they change their menu often, and according to either what is 'trending' in the foodie world or seasonal items. I'm pretty sure that i've tried all of their salads at least once and am never disappointed.  For breakfast, I always get a breakfast sandwich and yesterday's corned beef, swiss, and potato pancake sandwich was TO DIE FOR. My fiance and I BOTH got it and thought that every bite was heaven. This is new to their menu (or at least i've never seen it before) and I will absolutely come back for it again! I think that it would be just as good without the bun as well.

As soon as I pulled out the meal from the bag, I realized the one substitute was missed by Wildflower.  Bummed, I decided to call the manager (Curtis I think) and explained the situation.  He couldn't have been more professional.  I said, this may be crazy but could you Uber me the corrected meal.  To my surprise he said, \"sure, it's on its way now\".  I was blown away.  About 15 minutes later a gentlemen named Frank showed up with the corrected entree and a giftcard.  WOW.  Thought this type of thing never happened anymore.  Wildflower proved that wrong.  Customer for life!  Kevin & Ashley",

Afterwards, he walks up to the counter and orders a loaf sliced to take home. My pesto chicken sandwich was fresh and very tasty but the chicken piece was small, barely 3 oz. The fresh potato chips, and sweet potato chips where fabulois. My husband surprised me by ordering a meatball sub. He is from the East coast where they are excellent, and he doesn't even like ground beef! Anyway, this was a \"southwestern\" version with jalapenos,  which my husband wasn't thrilled with. The wait staff yesterday seemed bored. They were efficient but not very friendly. The one woman kept carrying the plates of food next to her body which got her covered in food, and the food..... um...yuck. otherwise I would rate 5 stars. Prices are just a tad high. Almost $5 for a CUP of soup, but the sandwiches were about the right price.",

Their menu is pretty big - lots of salad, sandwiches and soup options. They also carry many baked goods that looked really yummy. I ordered the beef stew with fruit salad combo (I love combos!) and my friend ordered a salad. We sat down and our food was served almost immediately.  The portions are very generous. My beef stew was what you could call hearty. Big chunks of beef, potatoes and veggies. Even the broth was thick and flavorful. It tasted fresh made, not out of a can. My fruit salad was fresh as well and had lots of strawberries, grapes and pineapple. Nothing worse than fruit salad that's nothing but cantaloupe. The fruit was served on top of greens with some kind of yogurt - very tasty. The sweet and light fruit was a nice counterbalance to the heavy stew. My meal also came with bread so needless to say I did not go home hungry.  The only downside to this place is the parking. There are a lot of restaurants in this strip mall so lunchtime gets really busy. We had to park pretty far away from Wildflower and walk over. Not a big deal when it's nice out but in the summer it could get kinda hot.",

The place is a little like paradise bakery in set up (you order at the counter, seat yourself), but the food is much better and tastes less processed. My Dad and I split the chicken parm sandwich and the wildflower salad. I was glad to find out that the chicken parm has grilled chicken on it (not fried) and only one slice of bread, bringing down the calorie count significantly. Also, the sandwich had TONS of flavor as it had veggies in addition to the typical sauce, chicken, and cheese.... I would definitely order it again. The salad was tasty, but my brother's asian chicken salad was better. I like that they have all of the nutritional info available on their website...it makes it easier to determine what might be fairly healthy. Surprisingly, most of their sandwiches are around 900 calories! Made me think twice before ordering. Despite this, I will go back because the food is very flavorful. At least I know what I am eating, and I like that.",

The bread is terrific, I'm especially a fan of the $2 Dough to Go baguettes that blow doors off of anything from the other local bakeries.   While the bread itself is great, my passion is the Grilled Turkey Pastrami. The first time I ordered this sandwich, I almost sent it back not realizing it had the \"Wildflower Coleslaw,\" which just looked too busy for my palate. However, it turns out to be the secret ingredient, with its white raisins, cabbage, and jicama providing a sweet and crunchy texture to the perfectly seasoned turkey pastrami.   My favorite part of dining at Wildflower? It's a local company. Yes, it's all sexy and looks corporate like a Panera Bread or Paradise Bakery, but it's an AZ company that contributes to the community. It's nice to know that if I get a gross sammi I can march up to Scottsdale and throw it at the CEO's head.",

I miss the days when bakeries made warm fresh soft bread composed mostly of butter and white flour. I blame Atkins and his \"fuck you, bread\" campaign... it's not like America is any less fat today for all his efforts.   Wildflower is pretty much another one of those artisan bread bakeries... dry, stale tasting, and mostly crust. Given that, I'm not partial to their sandwiches. I thought I'd like their grilled cheese, but once I was done gnawing on my fried sea sponge oozing with oily cheddar, I realized I was wrong. If I could sum up their sandwiches in one word, that word would be \"dry\" - but I could easily think of a dozen others that would be suitable substitutes, and none of them are flattering.   Aside from that, they have awesome salads and pasta and you can't really beat the price for what you get. I think they have good ingredients and for these reasons alone, this place would get 4 stars... they lose half a star (which is why I dropped them down to 3) because their tables are always filthy and covered with someone's dirty plates. 90% of the times I've been here, I've had to clear my own tables.   Most people are huge fans of Wildflower and I do like it... I'd just rather eat at Pita Jungle if I'm in this area. It does make for a great alternative if Pita is packed. It's certainly cheaper and quicker.",

    "text": "Panera Bread.   That's what I thought of when I first walked in. Wildflower is to Phoenix as Panera is to Oklahoma City, where I used to live. Yet, I wasn't quite accurate with that. You see, Wildflower goes above and beyond your typical bread company/eatery. Sure, places like Panera are great but Wildflower is in a league of its own.   Lucky for me, I knew what I wanted right away, which is unusual when I first encounter a new, exciting array of options. I chose their chicken basil chili and 1/2 their roast beef & Gorgonzola sandwich. Both were perfect - really. The chili was festive without being overly filling, for the 1/2 sandwich was a generous portion of sourdough bread, fresh tomatoes, red onions, lettuce, peppers (so good!) and Gorgonzola cheese. Plus, their herb mayo was an added touch I could enjoy (and I usually hate mayo).   My lunch companion ordered their black bean soup with a 1/2 turkey breast and brie sandwich. It looked equally perfect, with huge slices of brie satisfying my cheese-lovin' friend.   Plus, the price for this pairing was reasonable - just under $8.   My friend got a pretzel for us to share. It was definitely good, not to mention one of the biggest pretzels I've ever seen!   In fact, I don't think there was anything I didn't like about this place. When you walk in, you immediately see their vast selection of breads and sweets. Their menu is also diverse with a variety of options. You could probably eat here every day of the week and find something new and delightful with each experience.   I say experience because that's about what it is. You order your food at the register and get a table marker to place on your table. Shortly after, your meal comes hot and lookin' divine - really. While this is a get-your-own-beverage place, you can enjoy some of the perks of being waited on, like your food being delivered with clean silverware, as well as your plate being cleared when you finish. I like that alot. Then you can enjoy a few moments post-meal to chat with your comrad(s).  In the middle of the restaurant is this over-sized beautiful light (chandelier style) that looks like roots sprouting flowers. It's something, alright. I made the comment that I'd have that in my house, if I owned one - a house, that is.. Sure, that may be a bit over-the-top, but it's indicative of how I felt while dining here for lunch. Granted, I give my companion some credit, for I always enjoy her company. Also, she's the one who suggested we eat here. For that, I owe her - perhaps I'll spring for lunch next time (great excuse to make a return visit).   GOOD NEWS! I think I found my new favorite place to dine when I'm craving soup, a gourmet sandwich or fresh salad.   They also serve breakfast, have a kids section of the menu and whip up some fantastic cafe beverages, including ones that tempted me: the roasted honey cappuccino and the peppermint hot cocoa.   I definitely need to make a repeat visit, try their different breads and indulge in their breakfast menu, which is served until 2 p.m. on weekends. I mean, c'mon, can you really resist the roasted tomato feta & egg sandwich or the lemon ricotta pancakes? I didn't think so.",

It's so yummy I crave it all the time, and since it's a salad I don't feel gross after eating it. Comes with a bonus hunk of fresh bread. What I love about all of their salads is that they serve them in a flat container (to-go FYI) instead of a bowl, so you can get an adequate amount of dressing everywhere without needing to shake or mix it around. You also wind up with a better topping to spinach ratio.  Also they have really tasty tea with the fountain drinks. It's served warm so get a big cup and fill it full of ice if you want it to be cold.  They actually messed up my order today, however Amy was super nice about replacing my salad and also threw in a bonus gift card for the hassle without me even asking, which is why I'm writing this review. I get that mistakes happen, and Amy exceeded my expectations. And my expectations are always high coming here because I love this place so much.",

I witnessed an incident with your manager Joandra and a gentle men who was angry because he didn't feel like he had enough portioning in his pasta I mean how is that her fault? I would of kicked him out the restaurant the second he yelled at me. I wanted to write this email and tell you how amazing your manager is. She stayed calm and collected, calmed him down let him know she understood his frustration refunded his money and apologized too much! He was holding up the line as well. I'm not sure if you do some type of training for these kinds of situations but wow. I'm a regular here I come mostly every day for a bowl of soup and I have grown very fond of her and I felt the need to speak up and show some recognition where it's due. She's always super nice to me knows my order by memory is always very informative. I just adore her you have a keeper wildflower.",

    "text": "I got a superfood salad and an Italian wedding soup. My boyfriend got a wildflower salad, tuna sandwich, and soft pretzel. I enjoyed my salad (he liked mine better too), and my soup was fine. Boyfriend thought that the mustard was an odd thing to add to a tuna salad sandwich and a few other odd combos that made it taste not like what you expect in a tuna sandwich. His soft pretzel was not warmed up; it was actually-refrigerator temperature cold. They did not bring out or offer mustard, so he went back to ask for some. He also found it a bit frustrating to have to go stand in line and ask at the counter for everything: mustard, butter, cups, to-go boxes. I think it should be common sense to offer mustard if someone orders a pretzels or butter if their menu item comes with a side of bread. Also, both my full-sized salad and my cup of soup came with gigantic slices of bread. Great, I love bread, and the slices were generous so I'm not complaining. But I'm not capable of eating that much bread in one go. I think it would have been great if there was another option besides bread offered: \"Both of your orders come with bread. Would you like anything else as a side with one of them?\" But the food was really good, so just one star less than perfect.",

With that being said, Wildflower Bread Company is always a reliable choice for a fast, reasonably priced meal.    Wildflower Bread Company offers a variety of items in a casual atmosphere. When you place your order you are assigned a number, you select your table, and your entree is delivered to your table.  If you order a drink you self-serve while you wait.   The portions are generous, fresh,  and reasonable priced.  Wildflower offers a wide variety of menu items to suit everyone's taste preference. I enoy the soups, sandwiches,  French Toast, Pancakes, and Bran Muffins.   Today, I decided to have the BLT plus with a side of potato salad on sourdough bread.  All I have to say is everything was absolutely delicious. The avocado spread and garlic herb Mayo were so tasty as was the sourdough bread.   The staff is always helpful, friendly, and the restaurant is clean and well maintained. If your ever in the area you should stop by, you won't be disappointed.",

I spotted Wildflower on the NW corner of Indian School and 44th Street and practically swerved into the parking lot (sorry everyone else)! I saw that there was a penne dish with marinara and ricotta so I ordered that with my meatballs. I also saw that the pesto dishes come with pieces of garlic bread, so I asked if I could have cheese added. Frank helped me and said NO PROBLEM! I also am a #1 fan of Wildflower's BLACKBERRY LEMONADE. It's so good! Frank brought me my to-go order and even helped open the door for me as I left (it was almost closing so I came at the perfect time). When I got home my food smelled amazing and tasted even better. The penne sauce is creamy and has a little kick from the crushed red pepper, which I loved, and the bread with cheese on it had toasted garlic bits all over. My mouth is watering all over again thinking about it! Delish food, great service, flavorful meatballs, and that blackberry lemonade. 10/10",

    "text": "Wildflower is my favorite place to work away from home or the office during the week.  With free wifi and multiple wall plug-in's available at every single booth, you can set up there for hours (but be sure to buy food/drinks, don't be cheap if you're going to be there for the day!)   The staff are great, always friendly and don't seem to mind too much when I camp out there for hours.  I like how brightly lit the place is, so many coffee shops are dim and dark and I would much rather prefer windows and seeing sunshine.    The place does always get busy, which provides for some nice distraction and people watching on occasion.   If you are planning on working or reading though, you may want headphones to drown out the noise or come before or after the lunch rush.   As for the food, I have a few favorites. I really want to like the menu better than I do, but unfortunately I have a hard time here.  I try to eat fairly healthy, but am always tempted by their pastries.  I can't eat lettuce (weird, I know) but I wish I could because the salads do sound fantastic.  So I'm still looking for my \"go to\" staples, but I have a few recommendations.    First, the items to skip:  Chai tea latte  (I think I'm addicted to Starbucks, this one just doesn't cut it - not strong enough for me, but this is definitely a personal taste), lemon bars  -  lemon is my favorite dessert option and I just do not like these, they are too thick and dry.  I keep trying them too, thinking I just had a bad batch, but after several attempts, I now avoid these.   I had tried quite a few of the cold sandwiches, and am always left disappointed. So I tend to stick to other parts of the menu, but maybe you'll have better luck.  Let me know!   On to the YES! side of the menu: For breakfast, the  Feta & Roasted Vegetable Frittata is awesome!  It is huge though, so share it with someone if you can (it's not great leftover, in my opinion).  The chocolate croissants are awesome if you are ready to splurge a little.  Yummy!   My absolute favorite is the Wildflower Grilled Cheese.. mmm!  I've tried to replicate this at home, but can't even come close to Wildflower's version.  Three cheese: Swiss, Brie, and Cheddar...with tomato and argula.   Delish!  If you like grilled cheese, this is the grown up version that will kick your own to the curb.    Their soups are really good too.  The best one I've had is the stuffed green pepper soup.  Get it in a bread boule.  Amazing!  But it's only served 2 days a week, so keep an eye out for this little taste of heaven in a bowl.  And... you can't go wrong with any of their breads, of course.  It is a bread company, after all!!",

BTW - breakfast is now served until 2:00pm on the weekends (10:30am during the week)   They open at 6:00am M-F and 7:00am on the weekends  Parking is very tight for the lunchtime crowd, so try to be there NLT that 11:40am or you may not get a spot since there's more restaurants in that plaza than places to park! If you're just popping in to pick up a to-go order, this won't be an issue since they have the some to-go parking in front of the door.",

We mostly go here for breakfast and make a special request for chocolate chip banana pancakes which are the best I've had anywhere, and I've done my share of requesting those in many places. The pastries are great, the sandwiches and salads are awesome. You can't go wrong. I brought my parents when they came to visit and they love it too. Friendly staff, free internets and outlets at every seat is icing on the cake.",

I have never seen so many folks with laptops humming away and no sign of food next to them so I assume they have eaten and are now done. I guess the hazard of offering free wifi.",

If I order a salad I typically get the pomegranate chicken but my boss gets nothing but the Caesar every time he goes.  I only have two complaints. One is the bread they serve with whatever I order is always a really hard crust bread that you need a chainsaw to eat. A friend told me you can request another type of bread but I never remember. So the bread I have been served I don't like.   My second complaint is their wi-fi policy (or lack of). Wildflower really fills up at lunch and when I go there are always multiple people camped out with their laptops just sipping a drink. A few times I have seen them at tables for 2, but mostly they take the very desirable booths. Wildflower needs to change how friendly they are to \"wi-fi campers\".",

I have come here with my large (10+ people) family several times for breakfast, brunch, and lunch. Our order is always taken so promptly and the staff is so nice with the kids. We can always find a big clean table, very comfortable atmosphere.  The tuna, the roast beef, the hummus, the bites of Mediterranean salad I took from my mom ... I can't even choose a favorite menu item. Oh, and the bakery... The piece of chocolate chip scone I swiped off my husband's plate last time was heavenly. There is such a great selection for breakfast too. The frittatas are light and healthy, and the stuffed French toast is a real treat - My little sister didn't even notice when I took a bite!  This is the perfect place for breakfast and lunch. I will keep coming back any time I'm in the neighborhood!",

    "text": "I want to discuss the excellence of the food here, but first the bread alone is worth mentioning:  Think of the best bread you can buy at a regular grocery store, even from their bakery.  Now imagine a bread that is much better, a solid 5 or 6 times better, and you have the Wildflower Bakery bread.  They offer a variety of artisan styles, and they will slice the loaves for you.  I say loaves, because you should buy at least two.  Now on to the menu:  This is a breakfast and lunch place.  All of the items that come with bread are, you guessed it, made with the wonderful bread  mentioned above.  All of the sandwiches are outstanding.  A few that stick out to me are:  BLT sandwich  Sweet potato sandwich  Beef Brisket sandwich  All of the breakfasts are healthy, tasty, and leave you feeling energized.  I wish Harlow's in Tempe had this type of food. Wildflower is delicious, fresh, and healthy.  You order at the counter, and the food is brought to your table.  It always seems like you won't get a table when they are busy, but as if by the use of magic, we always get a table well before our food is ready.  I have never had a bad experience, and the consistency of what they offer is astounding.  It impresses me when a company can be so good, so often.",

A few nights later, I had the absolutely pleasure of tasting a variety of Wildflower's offerings at a Yelp Event.  The butternut squash ravioli was incredible.  I could've eaten a few platefuls of that goodness... but I had to save room for the turkey/cranberry/stuffing sandwich, which was like a little bite of Thanksgiving.    I need to return to try the huge number of pastries and other baked goods... and work my way through the rest of the menu.

We stopped in at Wildflower Bread Company over the weekend because I had heard great reviews about their freshly baked loaves of bread. We were just going to pick up a couple specialty loaves since we needed bread at home anyhow. Instead, we ended up staying for lunch after we got a peek at the menu and the dessert case.   My fiance ordered the salmon alfredo and he loved it. This said a lot to me because he's normally not a pasta person. The salmon itself was really good - soft and flavorful. I had the butternut squash ravioli - one of my all time favorite pastas - and WBC's version did not disappoint. I loved the nutmeg flavor it had - perfect complement to the creamy sauce and the butternut squash. Both dishes came with big slices of grilled toast. The pasta portion sizes itself were perfect. Just the right amount to feel satisfyingly full but not overly stuffed like the portion sizes at Cheesecake Factory or Macaroni Grill. We ended our meal by splitting a lemon bar which also was devoured down to the last crumb.  It was a later lunch for us (around 3pm) so it wasn't crowded inside but there were still a good amount of customers so it seems to be a favorite. Service was pleasant and fast and the menu has a wide variety of items that we're excited to go back and try more.",

The only sad thing is that bread is pricey here. We went for breakfast here last week. Fabulous coffee and free refills. Awesome passionfruit ice tea ( I had to try both). Even the kids menu was great. Cute sand dollar size pancakes. Another plus, they have the Hero brand jelly. Great Swiss quality I used to back home. All fruity goodness without the high fructose corn syrup. Yay. Will be back many, many times and get the holiday bread. Willing to shell out a bit more to even buy their loaves.",

The last few times I have eaten at this location I have gotten sick after eating the food. Today I ordered my usual--after I ate it I started feeling nauseated. I thought a nap would help, but my stomach hurt so bad it woke me up. This is gross, but needs to be said...I have been throwing up ever since.  I'm not sure if the staff has improved much, either. Every time I order they give me an apathetic attitude.  I appreciate everything the upper management for Arizona has done for me--thank you for being concerned and for all of your help! I am sorry this location did not work out for me because I love this company. I just won't be returning to this location. I will still attempt other locations, but I've had enough with the one on Indian School and 44th Street. It's just not worth getting food poisoning again.",

There were 4 workers and none of them bothered to say anything for at least 3 minutes. When I did say something, the woman was very snappy and cut me off saying that she would be there in a minute.

Since my last review, I've been back twice - both times I experienced wonderful customer service and new menu items that I thoroughly enjoyed.  I highly recommend both the berry yogurt parfait and the chopped salad.  I believe that it's all about ordering the right thing off the menu, and I found my 'right thing' in the chopped salad... It reminds me of the Cowboy Ciao salad - only it's $8... That's right - I said $8 for a salad with grilled Atlantic salmon, arugula, Israeli couscous, feta, red peppers, dried sweet corn, dried cranberries and sunflower seeds.  It looks like a piece of art when It's served; and then they come toss it up with a Pesto Vinaigrette tableside for you if you'd like.  What a treat!  I hope this becomes a standard menu item in the future.  I've also been back to Paradise Bakery and can no longer compare the two... Wildflower blows Paradise away in my eyes.  I will for sure return to this or one of the other seven Valley WBC locations again for an affordable, fresh, delicious meal real soon.  I may even recommend it!  ****Free WiFi and delicious Iced Tea are additional perks as well as the mighty fine looking selection of breads and baked goods!",

However; there is one employee who I can not say the same about. Michelle!!!! She makes my experience going to wildflower hell. So rude and always has a nasty attitude. One time when I went I was clearly in line waiting my turn and she helped a guy who walked in after me even though I had already been waiting in line. She didn't even acknowledge me. When I told the manager she ignored me and went into the kitchen. Really? I ended up leaving and never wanting to come back. If it wasn't because I enjoy their food so much I probably wouldn't! Never fails that when I go and that employee happens to be there I always get the same nasty attitude from her. One time she was even bribing customers to give her a good review for a contest they had. She would give them free items in return for a good review. Even some employees mentioned to me what she was doing. Oh and guess what? She won the contest! I can name three other employees who are always happy to help and treat me with respect who actually deserved to win. I don't know how she's managed to have her job for so long. She is the reason why I gave this place three stars.",

She enjoyed her chicken Caesar salad, and said the mushrooms added were different but she ended up liking them.  She also liked her passion fruit iced tea.  My ham and Swiss was basic but of good quality, and the potato cream cheese soup was a generous bowl that was delicious as always.  Add some black pepper and dip your bread in it and it is spectacular.  The employees were competent and hard working during the lunch rush, and even though the place was pretty crowded, there were still open tables and it was not too loud.  Usually my soup comes with a side of bread though, and this time it didn't, so taking off a star for that.  It's a step above the disappointment that Paradise/Panera has become, and even though it's a little bit longer of a wait than the likes of Subway, Wildflower is an excellent lunch spot with great parking, albeit right off of a very busy street.  I've had their breakfast at Chandler before too, and I polished off all of my stuffed French Toast, so I can vouch for that too.",

We've dined here previously &, usually before the outdoor concerts held at the railroad park, we have ordered to go & it's been great. This time, we decided to dine-in prior to concert. Frank, the manager, personally greeted as us at our table. He noticed that my daughter had not eaten her food & asked if he could replace it with something she'd prefer, as she had tried a new dish that she hadn't. Frank made it a point to allow her to feel comfortable changing her mind & encouraged us all to let he, or any staff, know if our meals are not to our specific liking. He brought out a new plate, macaroni & cheese, & she rather enjoyed it. He was absolutely gracious. He also helped me to look for a ring I had lost, which I'm happy to say, was recovered. Just an FYI, they do not allow leftover food/bread to be wasted, they actively donate that which will not be used timely enough, to groups that make sure it's shared with those less fortunate or going through tough times. It's readily apparent that Frank & Wildflower Bread Company take pride & joy in conducting their business from a place of great integrity. Thank You!",

The only reason I don't rate w/ 5 stars is because the last time I bought a few from this location, the crust flavor tasted \"off,\" as if another lipid was used to cook them with, or that the butter used was slightly rancid.
