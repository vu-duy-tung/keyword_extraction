Burgers were decent, but patties seemed like they were previously frozen or maybe just overcooked.  They looked like preformed frozen patties.  Food came out pretty fast and pretty good price.  I would try it again if I wanted a quick fast food meal and a new variety of soda.",

    "text": "I was skeptical of this place when my coworkers told me about it, but when I walked in for the first time and saw the wall of bottled sodas, I changed my mind.  They didn't even mention that!  Seriously, though, they have a lot of sodas.  A whole refrigerator full of root beers.  A row of birch beers, a couple rows of colas, a row of Faygo sodas, a couple rows of ginger ales/beers... Really, every soda you can think of besides spruce beer (I guess I'll still have to go to California to stock up on spruce beer).  Of course, this is also a burger place.  The burgers are fantastic, as long as you're not expecting a gourmet, 95% lean, thick patty $12 burger.  It is better than the Five Guys and Smashburgers of the world.  Try the New York burger (Pastrami, slaw, rocket sauce), the Santa Fe burger (bacon, fried green chili, rocket sauce), or the Baja burger (pico de gallo, bacon, rocket sauce I think).  Those are my personal favorites.  I have also had the gyro burger - pass on that one; the tzatziki sauce is great, but the gyro meat is probably the frozen variety.  They don't specialize in gyros here.  I pay this place a visit every week now.  The fact that their A/C doesn't seem to work well in the summer doesn't even dissuade me.  My biggest complaint is that they have a soda fountain.  People who prefer carbonated sugar water over delicious specialty sodas are simply not worthy - they're casting their pearls before swine.",

The owner is very friendly and quite helpful if you're new to the menu.   I loved \"Pop the Soda Shop\" and it moved all around AZ until, I guess they closed. I don't know if they merged or something, but they have everything they had there. All the sodas!   I'm introducing another friend of mine to the place next week! I can't recommend  it enough!",

I probably used at least 10 napkins while eating that thing, but looking like a socially unacceptable slob was so worth it. It was huge, tasty, and took me from \"hungry\" to \"omgwhydididothat\" in no time. Rocket Burger is America.  In addition to selling ludicrously sized burgers, Rocket Burger also sports an impressive collection of specialty sodas. The vast walls of varied sodas more closely resembles the beer selection of a very-good liquor store, which alludes to the restaurants previous life as a bodega.   If you've got a 12 inch burger and a soda, then you most likely don't need a side dish, but for fellow Yelpers with monstrous appetites, their fresh-cut fries are wonderful. I haven't tried the onion rings or cheese curds yet, but I don't know if my body is ready just yet.   If you're suffering from an extreme calorie deficit or just wanna stuff your face like no one's looking, make Rocket Burger a priority.",

Coolers line one wall containing a fascinating assortment of beverages, including one whole section dedicated to root beer, and one drink the owner admits tastes like 'tree'. Really, tree. If you can't find it here, it probably doesn't exist!   The charm in Rocket Burger is that it isn't trying to be something it is not.

The bun was toasty yet soft, the veggies were fresh, the meat was perfect, and the thousand island sauce was the icing on the cake. I had the fries and the onion rings as well.

We got there, and I'll admit, from the outside looking in, and even once inside the door, I was a little put off.  I wasn't sure I wanted to stay there and eat.  All that changed once we got a good dose of the service (and food)!    She ordered some pizza bread, with pretty much every non-meat topping available, and some cheese fries with no chili.  I ordered a Chicago dog with chili fries (no cheese).    We got a few drinks from their AMAZING soda selection.  She got two of the original Dr. Peppers, and I got a Leninade.  She ended up hating the Dr. Pepper because it used real sugar, and drank my Leninade...a taste of things to come once married I suspect.  The pizza bread, according to her, was delicious.  The fries, superb.    My dog was amazing.  I expected the actual hot dog to be a little bigger, but with all the things you get on the dog, it's a real meal.  I ate that, and some of the fries (which were really really good...though I should have gotten the chili cheese fries instead of just chili) and was stuffed.    The people that work there are very friendly.  They brought the food to us rather than just calling out our names, offered to exchange the unopened Dr. Pepper for something different since she didn't care for it, and had good humor when my fiance made a joke about them not having veggieburgers.    The only thing holding it back from being 5 stars is that the tables needed wiped off.",

It honestly would be a 4.5 kind of place but I'm rounding up because of how quick the service was and the insane variety of sodas you can choose from.  it's basically the Total Wine of soda places.  I got some Leninade soda and it was delicious!  The wife got a grape soda that made you forget about any other grape soda you've ever had.  The food is great too.  I had the Santa Fe burger and it had a weird sweetness to it that I wasn't expecting (it had to be the pickles!) , and a very nice bun that absorbed everything the burger was throwing at it, and it was a lot (Good house sauce!).  Again, I will go back, and I will get root beer!",

    "text": "It's hard to not give this a five and I may just end up doing so just to frustrate people that hate seeing perfect scores: Seriously I was skeptical but after what seems like a streak of  3 star reviews I finally have something good to report on the end of the food chain I can speak to:)   Is it the best chili cheese dog I've had? No.The best  chilli-cheese fries? No.Most extensive selection of sodas? Again no but truly this place adds up to more than the sum of its parts.It has nearly the best of all three  in one friendly, clean place that I'm looking forward to returning to.   Their Chili-cheese dog takes Sonic's to school and steals its lunch money. The texture of  fine ground meat  / amount makes it easy enough to eat and theirs actually has flavor in the chilli, you know  unlike every chain that tries to sell you the same thing.   When added to cheese and the  fries it was really great  though my preference is for fatter fries this was a great portion for the money.    Wife's  bare lettuce and meat burger was tasty with maybe a slightly enthusiastic shake of the seasonings  but to be fair if it was a fully dressed burger I bet it would be hard to tell.  Kid's Cheese burger ,oh yes, very very good and hopefully he appreciates now why we keep him away from that clown.     Really the choice is great, the soda's great,  friendly people that ask, and really seem to care, if you liked the food give this a 4.5   rounded to five.",

    "text": "The burgers at this place are amazing! The different combos that are available create a burger that goes above and beyond, like the Reuburger, a combo of delicious burger and a reuben sandwich. The subs are pretty delectable, too. I helped my wife finish off a Philly Cheesesteak that hit the spot. Don't miss the mushrooms...a real treat! And talk about an incredible soda selection!    I did experience a small issue on a recent visit...a part of my order was left out, and a return to pick it up was required. I contacted one of the owners, Steve, who sets a very high standard for customer service. He went above and beyond to correct the small issue, demonstrating genuine concern for his customers and the quality of the product and care with which it is served. Don't wait to try this little local joint...I can't see how any self-respecting lover of excellent burgers could be disappointed with this gem!",

We shared a side of chili cheese fries and onion rings. That and two can sodas came out to about $14. Sweet deal! Food was good. The burger buns were good... (I think they make their own?), the meat was nicely cooked and it was tasty. The burgers come with shredded lettuce... normally I'm not a fan, but in this burger I didn't mind so much. The onion rings were coated with cornmeal and was nice and crispy. Not overcooked or undercooked, they were just right. The chili cheese fries was huge. That could be a meal on it's own and then some. Also, I liked the fact that they had gingerale =)  So, basically... it's a place to consider if you're in the area but I wouldn't make any special trips from Chandler for it. But I might just find excuses to go out this way just so I can eat here again ;) Oh and the people there were super nice and friendly!",

    "text": "Rocket Subs & More opened about three weeks ago. It's hidden away in the Church's Chicken plaza at 35th avenue and Cactus. The boy and I were on our way to another sub shop today when we drove by this sub place, we made a quick executive decision to go here instead and pulled in.  Walking in, there's the counter to order on your right, seating to the left, and cases of sodas and beverages along the back wall, with shelving for chips, corn nuts, etc. After some brief decision making, we decided to order a Rocket Dog combo meal (easy on the mustard and ketchup, with onions), and a Country Club sub, toasted.  Combo meals here are awesome, you get chips or fries and a drink from their first case (cans of your everyday soda brands), for a dollar more, you can select a soda or drink from one of the other cases - and that is where the fun begins. They had TONS of different brands and flavors of sodas to choose from. I chose a Mason's root beer in a super cute glass bottle, and the boy chose Pepsi (boo - boring choice!).  It took less than 5 minutes for our food to be brought out to us. The sub? Amazingly toasted goodness - eat your heart out, Quizno's! My hot dog and fries were also awesome. The fries were well seasoned and crunchy, the hot dog made perfectly to order. :)  The owner swung by our table and asked how everything was (awesome, thanks!) and he also shared that starting next week they will be serving hamburgers and cheeseburgers.  Overall, the food was awesome, the selection of drinks was great, and we will be back for more.  Last, but certainly not least - the price? Great! For two sodas, a huge sub, a hot dog, and a giant side of fries it came to $11.00! :)   Before leaving we also took some sodas for the road (Captain Eli's Ginger Beer, anyone?)",

Bacon used on burger was deep fat fried not pan fried and could tell by grease taste. Cheese looked yummy melted but again no taste--not real. Fries were way over-cooked and not seasoned with anything. Ranch dressing waa good for dipping condiment and tasted homemade. Fountain drinks were all low on flavor and just not good. My double bacon cheeseburger with fries and drink combo was $11.00 with a 10% off coupon. Not worth it. If they upgraded quality of food products served, I'd consider a return trip but not otherwise. You're seriously better off with a fast food chain burger combo. Sorry, keeping it real for real.",

There was an angry customer who was upset over their version of a gyro. His hair was a greasy as the fries (I'll touch on the later). He exchanged the gyro for a hamburger and when the owner brought it to the table he got to close to the angry  customer and I thought a fight was gonna bust out.  Now on to the food. I consider myself a foodie. The burger meat itself was \"wimpy\" and covered in a sauce. The bun did not end up standing up to said sauce and disintegrated before I was finished. I ordered the cheese fries and wished I hadn't. It was a large portion covered with shredded cheddar and was GREASY blech. I ended up leaving hungry. I did buy a four pack of soda for seven dollars....  I wasn't impressed at all!",

Not much on decor and located behind a Church's Chicken which is very hard to find the restaurant.   if you are into different kind of sodas this is your heaven. Not only different kind of soda for display but to drink.  Had the Eddie Lopez Single Burger which was a burger with Pastrami. Was pretty good and a solid bun to hold the burger together.  The fries were on the soggy side which I personally prefer to be crisp.   The soda selection is second to none and really overwhelming but if you want to try something new and different this is the place.   Would like to come back to try a hot dog or a sub which both look great.   Overall come for the food and not the decor, this could easily be a candidate for diners drive ins and dives.  Good find and good food, I like these kind of unique places. Will be back again",

It's a cute little counter service burger/sandwich joint owned and operated by an adorable married couple.  Honestly the food is in my opinion an A- but the customer service and selection of menu items as well as beverages is outstanding. The burgers are really good. Not the best I've ever had, but for a modest price, very well worth the money. Their fries are well seasoned and come in big portion sizes too.  Warning: this won't be everyone's experience! ...but, on my fiancee and my first time through, the wife/co-owner ended up bringing us a sample of some of the sides we had asked about while ordering. Didn't charge us or tell us she was doing anything; just brought it out and told us to enjoy. So nice!   So the decor won't wow you and yeah you may find a slightly better gourmet burger somewhere else but this little gem is worth a visit for sure and I'll be going back!",

Came with a large side of fries and a drink. The burger was great. I don't agree with other reviewers who said there is too much sauce. The sauce definitely dripped out, but the bun kept everything in place. The fries were cooked perfectly but could have used a bit more seasoning. Food came out very quickly.  The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of was the craft sodas. I didn't try any of the bottled sodas, but the craft fountain sodas were not my favorite. Still they also have standard sodas as well. So no worries there.  Will definitely be back. Used both the 10% off check in promotion and also got 10% cashback from yelp. After those, the meal is almost free!",

I had the cherry slush-puppy with a gyro burger and it was freakin' great! I was  expecting just gyro meat, and it was loaded with meat & a burger patty that was flavorful and moist!   The Philly is good, but we don't do green peppers, that's a Jersey thing! Get it right!   There was this WALL OF SODA. This place has every flavor and brand of soda out there! Try the cream sodas, the maple bacon, the butter scotch, so much!   Best part of the meal was the fried mushrooms. BEST. IN. THE. WORLD.  I've never had better. Seasoned to PERFECTION!

The staff member who took my order was very nice and the food was ready within about five minutes which was nice. And the wall covered in different sodas from all over the place was pretty cool.  While I enjoyed the fries very much due to the seasoning I was only mildly impressed with the burger itself. I got a double bacon cheeseburger which I expected to enjoy and finish. There was something about the sauce though that I couldn't figure out and it ruined my experience.  I hate the fact that something like the flavor of the sauce has anything to do with my rating of the place, but it was something I couldn't get through and I couldn't finish my burger. I tried working through it, too. It just got to a point where o couldn't ignore it any longer and the aftertaste was no different.  Would I visit again? Most likely but I won't be going out of my way to do so.",

    "text": "Came here yesterday because I was craving a burger. This is definitely a no frills type of place.  8 or so tables with order at the counter service (they'll bring your food to the table when it's ready). Settled on the Cali burger and a vanilla milkshake.  While I waited, I browsed what seemed to be an infinite number of bottled soda selections.  They were categorized by what appeared to be flavor so you can hone in on what you're in the mood for.  Both of the girls working the counter were extremely pleasant.  My food (to go) took about 7 minutes from the time I ordered it.  Total for the burger(single patty, no fries) and milkshake was about $9.50.  Got home and tore that burger apart.  Man, that was good.  I liked the Rocket Sauce that came on the burger.  Think a ketchup/mayo blend with a ton of pepper for kick.  I didn't even need to put ketchup on the burger.  The bacon was crisp (score!) and the avocado perfectly ripe. The buns they use are also on point.  Definitely more \"sturdy\" than a traditional bun (it reminded me of challah bread).   I saw a couple other burgers I'd like to try so I'll definitely come back and bring some friends along.",

Lots of soda to choose from, great hamburgers, and delicious fries.  It beats the heck out of a chain burger place in quality and character.  I even ordered the \"Rocket Burger\" which is a ridiculous three-patty monstrosity on a 10-inch sub roll.  I was embarrassed in front of my kids because I couldn't even finish my fries.  Rocket Burger has the makings to be a classic joint, legendary if they can match Capin' Bills longevity!",

We missed this restaurant the first time it's tucked in an unassuming strip mall right next to a church's fried chix.  We almost did not go in it was not impressive looking , but because of all the positive reviews we sucked it up and gave it a try . I had the double Teri burger ( lett, Tom , onion mayo,and pineapple) usually when I have a teri burger I omit the pineapple, what the heck does pineapple have to do with teriyaki? I did not omit the pineapple because they dip it in cornmeal and fry it, crazy,but good . The sauce was a little to thin. The burger was very good even with the runny sauce. The fries were made in house and very good , large portion. The owner or manager? Very friendly. We will be back",

When I got home (I live 2 minutes up the road), I opened my food containers and saw my fries were 100% burnt. I couldn't even eat them and had to throw them away. My burger looked good. Key word: looked. When I picked up the burger, it fell apart because the bread was SO SOGGY. I had to take my first bite using a fork and knife. When I tried the burger, the meat was under cooked. I asked my fiance how his food was it and it was completely the same. Disappointed. Won't be back.",

The entire back wall is a cooler full of all kinds of delicious sodas in probably every flavor known to man! lol. It took us a good 10/15 minutes just to pick one of those!

They have a separate soda shop next to the restaurant.  Ok so this is our place for burgers and we drive all the way from the East Valley to get them.  Hands down, the best.  And not only the burgers.  We have had the hot dogs = great; the crispy fish = delicious; and the pastrami w/ coleslaw = AMAZING!  Everything they fry is awesome.    The one thing I would say could be improved is the onion rings.  The batter is not very thick and tends too be very crumbly when eating.  Still tastey though!  And the owners/cooks are awesome!  Always have a friendly word to share.",

    "text": "Love me some Rocket Burger! As a family we usually go on a Saturday for lunch. I would give 5 stars but the parking is tight and recently there has been a storage container next to Church's Chicken which makes it even tighter.   My husband and I both usually get a bacon cheeseburger but this time I ventured outside my box and ordered the Thai chicken sandwich special. it came on the signature bun that is great and always fresh but never seems to hold up and at the end of the burger it falls apart..but I'm not complaining!  Sandwich was a real chicken breast breaded and fried with a spicy peanut sauce and a spicy slaw. Sandwich was amazing. Now I will be torn on what to order on future visits.  Hubs bacon burger is just that. A bacon burger, single patty with fresh customary burger toppings. Fries are always hot and freshly cut.  We also love the hundreds of bottled soda collection but find it a little pricey at $1.99 a bottle.  Rocket Burger is a great break from chain burgers and blows  most of them out of the water. Be prepared during busy times to wait for a table or clean your own.",

What I do like about the restaurant is the soda selections.  This is by far the biggest selling point of the restaurant.  My kids love coming here just so they can pick a new bottled soda to try.   I have ate hear twice.  The first time I got the Italian sub while the kids got hamburgers.   The kids said \"meh\" to the hamburgers and that is about how I felt with the sandwich.    The second time this place smelled in the inside.  Its that smell of rancid oil.  That smell tells you that the fryers are not clean and makes it questionable.   I would go back to Rocket Burger but just to buy the soda.",

But, the prices are a little pricey for the size and quality of the food.  I ordered the Afterburner burger (single patty) with ghost pepper infused cheese and an order of zucchini. Along with the drink, it came out to just over $14. And to be honest, it wasn't worth it as I was expecting a decent kick from the jalapenos and ghost pepper cheese. The jalapenos were not even close to spicy and the cheese did provide a hint of spice. It also had this rocket sauce (I think that's what it was called) and I'm not sure what it was trying to do. It had no flavor. Then, I saw the patty and it was pretty sad as it looked like one of those frozen patties from those commercials. So the burger I rated as a 1 out of 5 stars. Then we had the fried zucchini and they were pretty good. I think they used corn dog breading and it was tasty. So those I'll rate at 4 out of 5 stars.  I'm pretty sure I wouldn't recommend this place for the burgers, but good thing they offer a good variety of other items. They also have a ton of different soda to choose from. Hell! They have root beer on tap.",

    "text": "My hubby and I were jonesing for a burger. First thought was Lenny's, but of course I had to yelp and came across rocket burger. I was so excited to try this place out after reading the reviews. My mouth was watering. The plethora of nostalgic drinks, the hole in the wall atmosphere, ice cream, french fries, and burgers.  Sounds like a carb coma made of dreams. I first grabbed a cold cream soda in a bottle made with cane sugar from the refrigerator. Yum, my favorite! Starting off great..... I tried the french fries next which were hot and fresh. While they weren't crispy, I liked the seasoning and they were good. Saving the best for last, I took a ginormous bite of my New York burger. Pastrami, swiss cheese, and coleslaw on a burger.  Sounds like heaven right? Wrong! First, the bun to ingredient ratio was off. The bun was more substantial than the meat and other ingredients or lack there of.  Very lackluster in flavor and somehow wet and dry at the same time. The rocket sauce which soaked my burger was not my cup of tea. It was a watered down mayo that was sweet with a hint of vinegar and other flavors I couldn't put my finger on. It was weird tasting to say the least. My husband who doesn't have much of a palate went as far as to say it was gross. Both our burgers were heavy and dry.  He got a regular bacon cheeseburger. Can't go wrong with an original. Apparently not in his case. He was so grossed out by the soggy scrapping of lettuce and over abundance of chopped onions soaked in rocket sauce that he scrapped off everything and ate only the burger patty as there was only a crumbling of bacon. The worst part of the whole experience was my hubby's look of severe disappointment and the all knowing \"I told you so,\" followed by \"I wished we would've just gone to Lenny's.\" I know everyone has their own ideas on what's good and what isn't, or maybe it was an off night, but it was the first time the yelp reviews didn't match my expectations.  In fact my culinary experience was the polar opposite. So disappointing To end on a good note, the cream soda in the bottle was the highlight of my meal as well as the nice staff. The person taking my order was really nice and the lady that brought over our food was pleasant as well.",

I ordered online and my large burger was supposed to be nice and long sub style. Well instead the chopped it in half and threw it in a box. So much philly cheese steak cheese and peppers that i couldnt even taste the actual burger. It was flowing off the sides. I couldnt even pick it up with my hands. Literally. That gets me to the next point. It was so covered in junk that the bottom bread was literally soaking wet. Mostly grease from what I can tell. Absolutely not edible. Presentation on this burger was literally 0. I mean... I had to use a fork. Greasy toppings with hardly any bun. So our next item was a large cheese curd. It came in tinfoil in a to go box and was extremely greasy. The top looked presentable but the bottom was covered in grease. Let it sit hanging in the fryer longer next time! Disgusting. After just a half of my burger and 3 cheese curds I was feeling quite ill. Not food poisoning type sickness but certainly queasy probably from all the grease I just ingested. Honestly, I don't think ill be back. What a shame.  Pictures posted. There is actually a burger and some bun somewhere under all those toppings.",

The buns are very good, solid enough to hold up under all the marvelous stuff they put in their burger/sandwiches but soft with a nice bite/texture.  Back to the sodas...I think that it would be a very fun thing for a group of friends to gather and have a soda tasting event. It could event be a MeetUp. I do not want to even start listing the selection--just visit and take a look for yourself.  Finally, I have always been served by the same pleasant gentleman all the years I've been going there.

I ordered the single Cali burger, it had bacon, avocado cheese and the usually fixings. It was good but way too greasy for my stomach to consume. The onion rings were so-so.

They put rocket sauce and their special coleslaw on many of their items. Both are delicious , but make for a messy experience. We also love the mini corn dogs. Large portions of everything, especially the fries (one side is totally enough for 2 adults). They have every soda you could ever want, even faygo which is hard to find outside of Michigan. They've also added taps with craft soda. Cool place, not for those on a diet lol :D",

We watched a video review about them on \"Check Please, Arizona\" great reviews. Ugh. I would easily say I'm a foodie, and know what food should taste like. I got my \"burger\" the New Yorker, which was highly recommended by the show and by the cashier. The pastrami was fresh, their coleslaw was okay, the burger wasn't even cooked and it wasn't  2 cm thick. And it was worse than a few fast food burgers. Ugh!! Then, when you walk into the place, it looks like a grocery store. Not real inviting. The wall of different soda pops was cool, but way over rated! I will never go back to this place. Not good enough food to retry! Sorry, just my opinion.",

    "text": "Rocket Burger is a fun place to go for lunch and the food is excellent!  My favorite so far is their Philly Burger.  The double size is only $6.99 and is very filling. It's topped with grilled green peppers and onions, along with provolone cheese and mayonnaise. Another good sandwich is their California Club.  It comes with Turkey breast, tomato, avocado, sprouts, cheese and mayonnaise.  It's on whole wheat sub that only costs $6.69. Both are great!  I've also had their roast beef sub.  It has roasted peppers, provolone, and yummy horseradish mayonnaise, along with lettuce and tomatoes for $6.69.  If you are seeing a trend on prices here, that's because all of their medium sandwich or double hamburgers are $6.69. But, they do have smaller sizes which start at $4.49.  One of the most cool and impressive things about Rocket Burger is their assortment soft drinks bottles in their refrigerated case behind where you sit. They say it's over three hundred. Have you ever had a Judge Wapner root beer? How about a Dad's Cream Soda, maybe Grape Nehi, Royal Crown? It's impressive that's for sure.  My friends, Arlin B and Rand H have written glowingly about their sandwiches. But the best line comes from Arlin regarding their double burger pastrami.  He says: \"It was a mouth watering double burger that came with Hot Pastrami stacked on top of the two patties covered in melty-cheesy goodness, toppings and their thousand island dressing.  It was FANTASTIC!!\"   Got the visual image? Good. Enjoy!",

The fries had a sweet aftertaste, which for not being sweet potato fries was strange. The portion for the standard combo fries is rather large and would have been a plus if not for their sweetness. The burger itself was not particularly memorable, with its blending of flavors advertised (gyro double burger) into one creamy greesy taste. The soda choices however are large and encompassing so I'd your not a fan of Pepsi products, you've got choices.   P. S. An item that did concern me was the cooks decision to take their smoke break at the kitchen door at front of the store. Eye contact was made along with a wiff of Tabacco when I walked in, followed by the uneasiness of watching the same cook enter the kitchen area while I was placing my order. I will not speculate if the cook had washed their hands or not, or whether they were the only cook on duty, but there was no sink in view of the front counter that was used upon their re-entry.",

The burger bun was twice the size of my double burger patties, although the bread was yummy. The sauce was way too sweet for my liking and tasted exactly like coleslaw dressing, and the bacon, instead of being nice crisp strips, it was chopped up burnt little scraps. The cheese fries were just ok too. I usually am a big fan of thin cut extra browned french fries but these had very little flavor, and zero salt. Fries should be salted as soon as they come out of the fryer while they are still wet or else the salt will never stick... Lastly, the older gentleman who took my order kind of seemed inconvenienced by having to take my order, which is a very uncomfortable feeing.  None of the food I ordered today was bad, it just wasnt all that great. I will probably be back to try a sub and some onion rings. Maybe I can give them a better review next time.",

Both were delicious and very well cooked. The service was very friendly and help explain some of the items on the menu.

I really liked how even though it was to go they included a large Cup of an jus to dip my sandwich in. After the sub I was very satisfied.   As mentioned in other reviews they have a large selection of sodas to drink for sale. I really wasn't in the mood for a soda or I would have tried one.   I'd like to come back to try more sandwiches and a burger. I was impressed with the friendliness of the staff and value and quality of my sandwich.

They make everything fresh and its obvious. Workers are polite and quick. Place is clean, not very big but it works. Now, the soda selection. Holy moly. They have any soda you can think of, and theres more at the \"Pop shop\" right next door. Pepsi and another craft soda that im not familiar with on fountain, and EVERYTHING else in bottles. All in all, great experience. One of my favorite hole in the walls in phoenix. Would recommend to anyone and everyone who loves a good burger and a cold soda.",

There soda selection is always growing and if you get a chance you have to try; The Flying Cauldron \"non-alcoholic\" Butterscotch Beer.. If you tell other people that you 'like' butterscotch so they don't think you're weird, this is your dream soda. Whenever I go I buy two because the 1st one I inhale and the 2nd one I actually drink slow enough to enjoy..;-)  I realize that I have never mentioned the service which has always been the \"no-brainer\" part of deciding if I want to eat at Rocket Burger. There are those places you love to eat, but wish you could get someone to go get it for you \"You know 'cause the food's great but..\" and the 'but' is not wanting to have to actually go there.   This is not one of those places..I swear on my bones. :-)",

I had the Bacon double cheeseburger  with fries or cheese curds and it's so delicious.  The burger is greasy, cheesy, and has lots of bacon.  Ya can't go wrong!  The french fries are also good, especially the cheese fries.    Paul has ordered take out from here for me quite often as well.  The cheese curds get a bit mushy if not eaten right away so go with french fries if you have take out.    Whether you eat in or get take out the food is awesome!",

There is a whole wall of bottled sodas from classics to crazy. We always try 4 or 6 different ones when we go.  I always get the teriyaki chicken sandwich. It is incredibly messy but so good. I usually go through 10 or 12 napkins trying to finish it. My husband has tried many of the burgers and said they are all great. Be warned, the servings are huge so you will leave full.  Seating it limited in this small place, as is parking, so we try in go in off hours so we don't have to wait for a table after we place our order at the counter.",

I'll give them props, because the sandwich was good, but I refuse to call it a burger, because the patty is barely an eighth of an inch thick and there is nothing to taste. It is, by far, the skinniest patty I've ever had had. I couldn't flatten it anymore if I ran it over with my xterra. Lennys, a few blocks north , has better burgers and it's actually a burger....you know, with meat and then condiments.  Not 3 inches of condiments,  then a sliver of a patty.  I wont be coming back anymore.",

It's a small quick place so you wouldn't expect the quality of food that comes out of here! I love the wall of the fun soda brands you can't find anywhere else. Always got to get me a sarsaparilla when I'm here!   I love the philly cheese burger. Caramelized green peppers, onions with melted provolone cheese on top. My mouth is still watering!!  There fries are good too! They could be a little crisper but overall they still have a lot of flavor. We got a chilly cheese hot dog too that was very good. Good size hot dog.   Highly recommend! Perfect place to take a friend, family, or even boyfriend/girlfriend for an amazing casual comforting meal.Thanks rockets! (:",

I haven't checked, but I wouldn't doubt if someone said that they have every flavor of soda known to man.   Couple of suggestions: I would order double patty burgers. The patties are a bit thin, so the single patty burgers tend to be cold due to the vegetables on top. Also, I would break out of the norm and order a burger out of the ordinary cheeseburger. They have some great \"out of the box\" burgers. This place is worth trying at least once.",

I opted for the Cali burger and the main flavors I could glean were the special sauce, avocado, and lettuce. The thin slab of beef was smothered by the sauce and veggies it had no chance of being savored unless eaten alone. Maybe I needed to make it a double but the single was already large. I think the focus of the burger was put toward the additives and not the patty. At least my friend enjoyed her special crispy garlic chicken sandwich.  The fries were our favorite side and the cooler after cooler of a gazillion different types of sodas was impressive. Service was fast and friendly but right now the next visit to Phoenix will not include Rocket Burgers, unless it's for fries and their unique selection of soda.",

My favorite is the Mexi-burger.  Fresh salsa, avocado, bacon, pepper jack and much more.  A great burger.  And then there is the great collection of soda.  My wife loves the fact that they carry her favorite \"Rock n Rye\" Faygo pop.  Straight from MI.  This place is definitely worth checking out.",

Akward (not very friendly) people at register, the place was filthy, the food was not great at all and we tried several items on the menu (about 5 different things). The fries were very greasy and mushy. The food was nothing to rave about. And the bathroom was disgusting. After seeing the bathroom, I really regretted stepping foot in there and eating! Not sure what the hype is about. Will not go back.",

I always try to give tips as well due to the fact that 1) I support local business 2) The owners and staff are very professional and cordial 3) the food is always well prepared not just slapped together like a typical fast food business",

The burger was cooked perfectly and the toppings were fresh (I especially loved the crispy bacon). I got a cali sandwich but ended up being so full from the bites I stole off my boyfriend's burger that I didn't finish it. Next time I think I will just get my own burger . I say get a burger \"Rocket Style\" and you will never want a normal burger again!  Also make sure you give your self some time to pick what soda you want because there are a ton of choices! I don't think of this as a negative factor (as some reviewers did), I think it makes this burger joint unique!",

They also have other type subs like their French Dip is amazing and comes with a side of fantastic au jus for dipping. Let's talk about the ginormous variety of sodas from all over, their coolers take up most of the space to display all the sodas. Gotta try if you are craving a burger.  Decor: not much to say but it looks very much like a liquor store that sells burgers in the back of the store.  Service: Counter Service but friendly, willing to help you find something you'd like.  Overall: I like the Burgers but will probably take it Togo. Not really a place you want hang out in.",

I had the New York burger. Unbelievable!!! It's topped with pastrami, coleslaw, and rocket sauce. The pastrami was easily way better than any deli has here in Phoenix and the coleslaw mixed with the rocket sauce which made the burger BEST IN PHOENIX. Hands down. And speaking of hands, the hand cut fries are so delicious. Near perfect. And the snozzberries taste like scnozzberries. Haha!! Yes, this place is also a Soda Shop!! Are you kidding me?!?! I was a 39 year old kid in a candy store with their amazing selection of bottled pop...yes pop...and fountain pop. I ended up with a Snozzberry fountain drink. You MUST try this. Thank me later. Beyond refreshing. Finally, the customer service was even better than the food and that is saying something. So don't even consider another choice. Get yourself to the intersection of 35th Ave and Cactus and devour Rocket Burger. I promise you will be a repeat customer. Well done and thank you Rocket Burger!!!! Customer now for life.

Truth is: what's special about Rocket Burger is 1) the bread and  2) the rocket sauce.  The burger itself... eh, just fine.   And, yes, there's forty million sodas to choose from but if you're looking for \"diet,\" you'll be forced to choose pepsi.  Still: four stars because the bread is awesome! I can not wait to go back and get a sandwich! Chewy, but you're not going to break your jaw or cut the roof of your mouth on it.   And, the rocket sauce puts other \"secret sauces\" to shame!

It was messy, it had good fresh lettuce and tomatoes, everything a good burger should be and have in my opinion  The bottled soda was fun to look through. We both are fans of huckleberry so we got different huckleberry sodas, very fun. Price was very reasonable for a good thick burger.",

Good place to bring the fam too.",

On the first visit I decided to try the Sante Fe burger (double) w/ habanero cheese that was nice and melted running down the sides of the patties, It was like biting into heaven. There is so much flavor packed into this thing its ridiculous...in a good way of course. First walking into this place was a little intimidating for me because I'm just weird like that. To the south wall  they have about a 24ft cooler of all kinds of sodas and to the west is where you order your food. The staff is VERY friendly and polite. If anyone is looking for a good ol local place to eat with a good variety of burgers, subs, sandwiches and drinks then give them a try, you will not be disappointed...and if you are then you are the one with the problem haha",

Not balanced well, pastrami was very light... if I didnt see it I wouldnt know it was even there.  Fries were old school shoe string. Nothing great.  The building itself is run down and beat up. Not a lot of work having been put into it at all.  Staff is excellent. Great people and great service.  Four stars for the soda selection and originality of menu. Will probably go back for one more pass at it but only because the reputation is good, first experience wasnt positive enough on its own.",

Also, a warning for anyone who orders online they don't check the 'special instructions', as there were mushrooms all over my burger. It's a good thing that I'm not allergic. Overall, the burger wasn't made with quality ingredients and left the grossest feeling in my stomach and taste in my mouth.

    "text": "Not too sure about Phoenix folks tastes in burgers.  2nd 4.5 star joint in a row that was meh!  Seeing is the name of this place is \"Rocketburger\", that is exactly what I got.  I ordered a Rocketburger with cheese and a fountain drink.  My total was just under $12.00.  Here is how it was..........  Rocketburger with cheese-  Meh.  This thing came with 3 patties, lettuce, tomato, onions and cheese.  It also had pickles and a \"rocket sauce\" aka thousand island.  The bun was a sub type roll and was fine.  All the ingredients were not that great though.  The burgers were way way way too salty, small and didn't taste good. The dressing had a weird \"tang\" to it also.  The cheese and bun were the only good things about it.  At around $10.00, I was dissapointed.  My mouth was swollen dry afterwards because of the salt!  Never again!  I ate the whole thing but would never get another one.  Diet Pepsi-  This was partly my bad.  They have 1000 or so bottled sodas for sale but I chose a fountain drink.  The Diet Pepsi was nasty!   The worst fountain soda I have ever had.  Tasted like root beer mixed with dirty water.   So nasty!  The guy at the counter and the guy who brought me my burger were friendly.  The food was below average and pricey,  and the soda was straight up nasty! Unfortunately I'm never coming back.",

There is an awesome selection of soda's in the bottle though.  Maybe that's worth the trip.  The wife and I rolled in after attending an RV show in Peoria.  On the way home, I remembered all the raves about this place, and it was about lunch time, so we re-calculated our route and made a stop in here.  I'm kind of a Root Beer fanatic, and it was great to see all the different brands.  I just randomly picked one.  Not even sure what it was, didn't have much head, but good flavor.  I also had been craving a hot dog.  Got one of those along with a cheeseburger.  The hotdog was awesome, grilled all-beef quarter pounder served nicely on a toasted bun.  That fixed my craving.  The cheeseburger part was simply for reference.  It was decently prepared and presented, but the bun was stale.  Not stale enough to taste bad, but enough to crumble into unworkable chunks of bread before I finished the burger.  I probably left a quarter of the bun in crumbles in my basket.  So overall, this was a first-impression review and I can say while I wasn't blown away, It also was not bad either.  Maybe I'm spoiled by all the custom-burger places in my neighborhood, and after all the raves I've heard, maybe my expectations were too high.  But for the price, quality and ambiance (which is not something they have) of Rocket Burger, it's a decent option.",

We knocked out the fish sandwich, the Cali burger, the chicken salad, and the best cheese curds I have ever had. Every item listed was awesome. The burger was huge, as was the salad. The fish sandwich was so tasty. The negative, the place is so far from my house. Love the food and the large variety of drinks to try. Who has ginger soda as a fountain drink? Yep, this place.

    "text": "This is a place you want to take visiting friends. It looks like a hole in the wall in a sad strip mall, but it doesn't let you down. The burgers themselves aren't super special, but the topping combos are killer. The Santa Fe burger, with a whole fried green chile on top, is a sight to be seen. The fries are surprisingly delicious and have the skins still intact. They remind me of the fries at Five Guys, which I think is a really good thing. Last time we went I decided to try the subs, and I would heartily recommend you do the same. I was feeling something a little more traditional, so I tried their Reuben. The sauerkraut wasn't too overwhelming, the dressing was perfect, and there was a ton of melted cheese. Mmm. I will warn you though: Whatever you get is going to require a LOT of napkins, and possibly a knife and fork. This isn't a place to take a dainty eater.  Their selection of pop (yeah, I said pop) is insane. All of them are priced the same. No stressing out over picking one out before ordering and wondering how much each costs. And after you're done eating, go next door to the pop-only storefront and pick up a 4 or 6 pack to go. I asked the owner how many different varieties he has, and he said right now it's 700+, so the choice won't be easy, but you'll come away with some interesting varieties. I picked up a rhubarb soda, and a espresso soda last time, along with the key lime one I had with my meal.",

We ordered our food to eat there but the guy that took our order, that was staring us down as we picked out our sodas, gave us our food to go.  It was pretty obvious he wanted us to leave, but we stayed anyway.  We ate some of the food and left the rest.  Will never go back and will tell our friends to never go in the first place.",

    "text": "So.. went to Rocket with the hubs based on other Yelper reviews. Yelp did not do us wrong!   First off, the location is a bit seedy.. 35th and Cactus, but you cant let that deter you. From the outside it could almost be mistaken for some kind of convenient store.. at one point it was a meat market or something... in a little strip mall next to a Church's chicken and a cash title loan place...   The inside has a row of booths again the window and a mishmash row of tables and chairs down the middle. One major wall is a giant cooler stocked full of beverages. To one side is the register and grill with 2-3 people manning that area.   The have a HUGE selection of root beer, cream soda, ginger ales etc. Totally cool... certainly a compliment to a great burger, no?   The hubs ordered a combo- dbl bacon cheese burger with everything on it (let, tom, onion, thousand island, pickle) with rocket rings. I ordered a single combo- cheese burger with everything on it and rocket fries.   The burgers were awesome... not too greasy, grilled nicely.. great flavor. ..Little bits of thousand island and onion falling out. The rocket rings looked to be hand battered, fresh onion rings.. a total surprise from a typical onion ring (usually of the frozen variety). The rocket fries were shoestring cut- my personal fav- not too greasy, just enough crunch and sogginess all in one.... served up with ketchup or ranch.   We both had a cream soda as part of our combo as well. Two different kinds, neither tasting anything like the other. The whole thing came out at about $15. Not bad for everything we got... pure deliciousness. Why would anyone go next door to the chicken place and get that crap?!?   I really hope these guys do well. I will definitely be back to try something else on the menu and grab a a different root beer or cream soda I never had before.   Yum.",

The Chicago burger was everything I could ask for in a burger - super juicy and tasty.  My second experience was unfortunately a 3 star experience: I went on a Saturday afternoon with a line to the door.  Now I didnt mind the long line because thats a sign of quality food and my last burger had been amazing so i was happy to wait.  Unfortunately, the staff didn't seem to handle the rush all that well.  The girls at the register were still friendly but things got a little messy out on the floor and in the rush to get the food out to so many people a few things got overlooked.  Most noticeably, my fries came out a bit undercooked and there were some pools of oil in the basket.  I have a family of 5 and all of our fries were way too greasy, also I went with the Chili burger this time and the chili itself tasted canned so the burger lost that freshness.  Still, this is a good spot just avoid the rushes",

Well, think about how one of those places got your hopes up and then  left them dashed, and head on over to Rocket Burgers & Subs for everything you thought you'd get with those other guys:  ~A fresh, clean, uncluttered atmosphere that you can sit comfortably inside of while enjoying your meal. ~A HUGE selection of almost any kind of soft drink you'd desire to quench that thirsty, dry mouth of yours. ~Lots of variety of menu, all with inexpensive good quality items of decent portion ~A radio playing the xmsirius Grateful Dead Channel for your soothing/stimulating dining pleasure. ~and a couple of really nice, friendly, hippy-on-the-inside-not-just-for-show restauranteurs eager to discuss their business and products, who are not only present now, but seem that they'll be sticking around to ensure the quality and value of their new place doesn't wane.  The food is fresh, fast, and inexpensive.  If you want burgers, subs, dogs, pizza-bread, gyro, salad, handmade fries &  onion rings, PBJ with homemade jam  -- they've got it.  The chicken sandwich had a light crispy breading and a solid chunk of breast meat.  The burger was a smaller patty (available as a double) but not dry, and the condiments were fresh and generous.   For both sandwiches, the standout part was the fresh bun from Simply Bread (local).  It was soft/firm enough to be just right, and had great flavor. They have a cooler chock full of interesting and bizarre selections from Pop The Soda Shop (Jones Soda, imported ginger ales and root beers, glass bottle real sugar sodas from mexico, dublin dr pepper, etc). My spicy Bleinheim Ginger Ale did not skimp on the ginger flavor!  A couple of real ex hippies would do it like this --  no flashy superficial emphasis on outward appearances and gimmicks, just quality, freshness, and friendliness that is truly genuine and sincere. I feel like I made a new friend. Rocket Burgers & Subs is one out of this world place, and I'm glad it landed in my neighborhood.",

I got two to take home: a Moxie for myself and this Japanese soda for my wife. The former was very old fashioned (I should have known by the Ted Williams poster they have displayed by the case) and not very good, at least to my taste. My wife's soda was a strawberry-flavored beverage with a really interesting bottle design and mechanism to open. It looked like a baby bottle and you use part of the top to open it...hard to explain.  As for the food, I had a chili cheese burger that was quite tasty. The burgers are served on large, soft buns perfect for their hefty burger creations. The chili was pretty sold, a firm B+ (nowhere can come close to the best chili cheeseburger in the world, which fyi, is at Tommy Burger in Los Angeles). The fries were just so so, not quite crispy enough.  I'll definitely be back and I'll come with an even bigger appetite, probably for the Philly Burger :)",

Right when I walked in I knew i was at the right place, with all the sodas everywhere and the place was packed with people. When I looked at the menu I was lost because it had so many things. I saw the New Yorker Burger and I said this has to be amazing with some fries and a nice creme soda! I also added a side of mini corn dogs because who wouldn't???.. The girl helped me out also on if my choice was good and she said yes that's one of the popular items. She was nice and kept saying thank you. After I ordered I went to the fridges with all the sodas and I was literally lost.. I had no idea on what to get so many choices and so many things I didn't know about. I wanted to try one of everything to be honest. I grabbed creme soda and sat down. Waited about 5 minutes and the food came out, so the service was excellent too. The burger was fantastic the coleslaw with the pastrami that just melts into your mouth so juicy so good. The fries are seasoned so perfect not having a lot of salt like most seasonings. The corn dogs were as expected so amazing.. This place is just incredible and I can't wait to come back to try other things!! Just wish it had more room and not one bathroom.. But it's okay I like the old feel to it! If you want good food this is your place!",

    "text": "First time there. So I wanted to play it safe, not go for any wild things. Just try standard fare and work up to others later. I figured if they can't get the basics right, maybe I don't go back.  My wife had a single cheeseburger, I had the double regular. We ordered these as combos, expecting regular French fries. We were quite surprised at the fries that arrived - scrawny, over-cooked, oily, not good flavor, and a strange orange tint to them. The burgers were better than the fries, however, I believe they put too much sauce on them - it was dripping everywhere, making it a difficult eat. (I prefer a burger that stays together and keep a fairly dry bun, not soggy like ours.) Also, the meat was still pink in the middle. If I get a big, fat patty like at Fuddruckers, a medium burger is OK, but on these thin little patties at Rocket Burger, pink inside is just not appealing.  Despite all this, I did enjoy the flavor of the burger, and could have actually eaten another (if I ordered with very easy sauce).  The big plus for this place that saved the experience for me was the management. I guess I was chatting with one of the owners when I was there, and he was very polite and cordial. I mentioned the name of the guy who recommended this place to me, and barely started to describe him, when he knew who I was talking about and where I know him from.  I will go back based entirely on the friendliness I experienced there. Only thing is, this time, I'll order some real kind of sandwich, and go for a different side item than their \"standard\" fries.",

    "text": "So is this a burger sandwich shop or a fantastic specialty soda / pop store? This place is SO COOL!  I honestly never knew there were so many kinds of soda pop and the flavors are just as cool as the design and names on some of the bottles.  Anyway I can't express enough how impressed I was witht their soda selection but my reviews are more about a restaurant and their food and this review will not become an exception.  I ordered three burgers to go. Two double cheeseburgers a chili burger two orders of fries and one order of onion rings. My 21 year old grandson had their chili burger and an order of fries. My wife and I had the double cheeseburger. She had the fries I had the onion rings.  My grandson said he liked his burger and that it was OK but nothing to write home about. He said the fries were about the same.  My wife commented that her cheeseburger was a little spicy and ate half of it because she just didn't care for it.  Her fries were OK.  My first impression was this: Right from my first bite there was something about the burger I didn't like. It tatsed OK, Their sauce is great but it does have a bit of a kick to it.  so what was it? I finally determined that the combination of their \"sauce\" and the way their lettuce is cut so thin it appeared there was coleslaw on the sandwich instead of lettuce. In fact if there wasn't it sure seemed like there was and I just didn't care for it at all. But everything else about the burger was fine.  The burger was good, the bun was different than you normally get a burger on, it tasted good and was hot. I agreed with my grandson though it was noting to write home about. My wife and grandson also commented on how they weren't really impressed with their fries, but I have to say my onion rings were deeeeeelicious!!!   Bottom line: Better than Rocket Burger is better than any fast food place. I guess I just expected a little more especially after reading the reviews.                      So I will have to give them another try   FOOD: NO wow factor or anything, however they are  better than any fast food place. PRICE: The prices are reasonable. SERVICE: The guy at the counter was nice and polite. AMBIENCE:  Looked more like a convenient store than a restaurant. CONCLUSION: Two Words: SODA SHOP The selection is intense. Best I've seen in years. Great selection of small batch brews. I love mom & pop establishments so stop by and support this really friendly neighborhood shop.",

Which was sad because it was a spicy root beer BBQ sauce, and what I could taste of it was spot on.

The location isn't all that great, like someone else mentioned it's more like a convenient store than a restaraunt. I ordered the gyro burger and it was such a great idea and delicious. My only complaint is the burger patty was really small and didn't cover the whole bun. I washed it down with a Fentimans Dandelion & Burdock soda which was interestingly different tasting. They have so many different soda's it was hard to pick one so I just tried the one with the oddest ingredients I could find. My friend ordered the Baja burger and it was very messy but she said it was awesome. She liked the bread and the toppings. We're both fans now.",

    "text": "If only I could give this place 50 stars...  They really do force me to grade every other eatery on a curve..  I've been coming here about twice a week for a year now and it just keeps getting better.  The staff is welcoming and eager to please, the selection approaches infinity, the value is absolutely unbeatable, and the food... OH MY GOD THE FOOD!!!  I've had so many amazing experiences here.  Like how we mentioned to the owners how cool it would be if they offered ice cream, only to find a whole slew of ice cream treats we never would've dreamed of a month later.  Like how I mentioned that I missed the Flathead Lake Blueberry Pomegranate soda (I wanted to try it in a float now that they had ice cream), and I came in 2 days later to find new ones in the freezer and a full case on the rack.  Or the time my girlfriend and I just stopped and stared at each other after our first bites of our Red, White and Blue Special burgers on the 4th of July.  Or my feeble attempt to finish a 3-patty-on-a-sub-roll Rocket Burger by myself on my first visit...  I've tried just about everything on the menu and have yet to be disappointed.  All of the burgers are incredible, but my personal favorites are the Philly Burger, The Afterburner, Teriyaki Burger, Steak Burger, and the Red,White & Blue Burger.  The Pescado de Cohete, a zesty spicy citrus fish sandwich, is a must try, as is the chicken (sandwich or nuggets).  And don't get me started on the subs...  I'm halfway through trying them all and picking a favorite just depends on my mood, none have disappointed me.  Same goes for the hot dogs.  The sides are perfect as well.  Aside from the MOST ADDICTIVE FRIES AND RANCH IN THE WORLD, they also have cheese curds, pizza bread, OVER 300 SODAS, SLUSH PUPPIES, and one-of-a-kind treats like PECAN PIE SHAKES!!!  On top of all of this, they're the best value ANYWHERE.  Where else can you get a $4 burger combo this epic???  I challenge anyone to leave hungry!  Every time I come here I think it just doesn't get any better.  But then I come back and they prove me wrong.  Long live Rocket Burger!!!",

Why yes please, butterscotch root beer? Omg yum. And here's a fun fact, you can make ANY OF THEM  a float! Sold! Next thing is the burgers. The bun is effing delicious. So not only is this burger giant, but the bun will not fall apart. I'm not sure if they are made in house, but who cares! Lastly the fries. Oh god. Fresh potato fries that are cooked to perfection. This is a great place to have a cheat meal, plus they are very quick with the cooking and delivery to your table. This place is a KEEPER!",

The avocado was fresh, the bun wasn't dry, and their \"secret\" sauce was still perfectly peppery and went great with the avocado and cheese. It's also one of the only places to get a lot of the soda they have on offer and today I chose a vanilla root beer from Barrel Brothers.  It seems that they bought most of the mini-mall they're in so there's more parking and will soon be a lot more seating. Good for them!",

I've been craving a Philly cheese steak for such a long time and this was also recommended by one of the employees at the register.   I've had quite a few different Philly cheese steaks from other places but this one is definitely one of the best! The bread was so soft and nicely toasted & didn't get soggy (as some of them do from meat juices). Perfect amount of meat and cheese too. Their fries, I wasn't that impressed with. They definitely look and taste hand cut fresh potatoes. I usually like my fries crispy so I asked them to be well done. This was a mistake because they actually tasted burnt rather than being crispy.   They have so many different soda's to choose from. They have so many bottle lined up against their windows and fridges full of bottles soda. & they also have craft soda on fountain.",

Burger was great, Bun, cheese, bacon, ground beef. It's a little big, and messy but worth it. Kids loved the hot dogs, and fries. Wife enjoyed her burger also. There were other options on the menu I would love to try next time.  Parking is not the best, but thats the way it goes. Not a lot of seating, however there are some. When we where there, they were have an issue with their soda fridge leaking water. Watch your step. Over all we had a great time, this is a place with great food!",

Grilled cheese on rye, way too much cheese and yes there is such a thing even for this cheese heard. Fries were the star for me, crispy and flavorful. Husband enjoyed his club sandwich. Downside for me was cleanliness, bathroom was unusable, tables were not clean, always makes me think the kitchen may be dirty too?  Probably not worth the caloric investment.",

When you first get here, it doesn't look all that inviting, but the food is soooo good!! I can see why this place has good ratings. The service here is amazing. The two girls working behind the counter at the registers were very friendly and helpful and gave great suggestions of things on the menu to try since this way my first time here.   I decided to do the bacon cheeseburger combo and upgraded my fries to chili cheese fries. Food came out fairly quickly, considering there were many people ahead of me. The young man that brought out my order was very professional and courteous. He smiled and asked if I needed anything extra before he left. Food portions are generous. I wasn't sure how big the burger would be, so I just order the single which was more than enough for me with the chili cheese fries. The burger was cooked well and tasted great! Chili cheese fries were a huge portion with lots of chili and cheese on top. Love that they give you enough chili and cheese to cover all the fries and not just the top ones.   Inside of the restaurant is small, so many people had to take their food to go. Need to enlarge the seating area so more people can enjoy the whole experience of this restaurant. Parking isn't the best, so come early if you want to be able to find front parking, otherwise, you may be parking out by the dumpsters.   Can't wait to come back and try more delicious food!",

The girl behind the register was new, I give her that, but there was a line about three deep and several other employees were just standing around, letting this girl drown.  I could see her struggle and frustration and felt bad for her.  I ordered the hatch green chili burger and fries and my husband got the teriyaki burger with onion rings.  Food comes out, smells good, take a bite, bun is stale.  Not toasted, but stale.  Instead of pitching a fit, I just pick off the stale ring around the bun and keep on going.  Decent flavor but I think I got a veggie burger with a piece of hamburger added.  I have had thicker pieces of deli meat if you catch my drift.  Thin.  Disappointing.  Fries were ok, but nothing exciting.  The onion rings were weird.  Battered in what looked like breadcrumbs and cornmeal.  Different, but not great.  Onto the bathroom.  It was filthy, no toilet paper and just overall not sanitary.    I dont eat burgers often, but when I do, I expect greatness.  This wasn't great.  Not even mediocre.  It was disappointing.",

The french fries and onion rings were just ok IMO.    They had a crazy assortment of sodas, over 300 in the cooler alone with a soda shop next-door with 500+.   Worth a visit and if come back.

They have a whole wall dedicated to glass bottle sodas, and you can find pretty much any soda you've ever wanted to try...including some you may not want to try (bacon flavored soda!)...but that's the fun of it.    As far as food and burgers go, there are some real options here like the New York burger which comes with Pastrami, or the Philly Cheesesteak burger, which is also incredible.  They also have hot dogs, subs, desserts, and so much more. There are so many options, which leaves me hesitant at most places because I wonder how they can do so much and still uphold quality, but this place manages to do it (try the ghost pepper cheese on your burger!).    On top of the food and soda, this is a local family-owned restaurant with friendly staff.  I have personally seen the owner talk with a homeless man who walked in and he gave him a drink and made him feel welcome even though the man didn't buy anything.  It's nice to have places like this in the neighborhood, and whenever I am in the neighborhood, I make sure to give this place my business.",

Rocket has arguably the best burger in Universe! I bet the astronauts on all of those Apollo missions and up on the space station wish they had it this good.    Steve and Denis, the owners, are both really nice guys. \"Fresh is where it's at\" at Rocket Burger and they have over 300 sodas in stock! But hey, don't take my word for it. Let's hear what the Steve and Denis have to say...  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.youtube.com%2Fwatch%3Fv%3D3MqQQvX0Ock&s=dddd4a180c4abda7d12546e84bd348587997bc87762b76e8e20bdc14fdb66baf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtube.com/watch?v=3MqQ...</a>  Gotta love that commercial. I wish it played on local TV.   I'm telling you this place is seriously really great. I always go with a bacon double cheeseburger, with pickles, onions, jalapenos, and man oh man that Rocket Sauce. I think I could drink it! Good thing I don't though. Check out my picture from this place. I mean seriously, how good does that look?!? I also recommend getting a side of their ranch for your fries. I know, I'm sounding like a total health nut right now, but bear with me. I think this place would be a perfect candidate for Diners, Drive Ins, & Dives.  It's T minus 10 and counting until I get in my car and blast off to Rocket Burger and Subs. I'm sure the burger and fries will have another great landing in my belly.  Get Your Rocket On!",

Inside is very simple with a rocket theme going on here and there. Outside looks pretty old and withered. Could have probably been a convenience store at one time or another. Parking lot is a bit small but achievable. Beep beep!  Ordered way too much food the first time and could barely finish it. They have Hot Dogs, Cheeseburgers, and a large selection of every type of Sandwich known to man. Very large portions. You can even choose Rocket size if you are feeling really hungry.  My favorite so far is going to be the NY Hot Dog which comes with Pastrami, Swiss, Coleslaw and Rocket sauce. Also have enjoyed the spicy Afterburner Chicken Sandwich, the Philly Burger, Mexican Dog, Chili Dog, and Chicago Dog.  Everything comes out fresh and ready to jam in your mouth. Their Fries and Onion Rings are also very delicious. Your meal is not complete without an Ice Cold Soda Pop from the cooler or a nice soothing Homemade Milkshake.  Place can get pretty busy during peak hours. They do have some additional seating next door. Great place to bring the kids and family. Be good and treat yourself to something fun. As Jackie Gleason used to say ... TO THE MOON!  4 STARS",

My husband had the New York Burger which the same thing with a hamburger patty added to the pastrami and he loved it also.  The only reason I didn't give it five stars is that they serve the string type French fries which I'm not a fan of and wouldn't order next time.

There are so many great things I can say about this place. First of all the burgers are amazing and quality is consistent. We have been going here since they opened and never have any issues. The staff is so friendly they know you by first name basis. If you are a bottle soda or flavored soda drinker this is the place for you. They have over 5 fridges full of selections to choose from. Now to the good stuff. I recommend that you try the After Burner burger. It is pepper jack cheese, jalapenos, this amazing mayo, and rocket relish...pretty much a pico de gallo. The Onion Rings and Fried Zucchini are coated perfectly and fried crisp not greasy. Don't forget to ask for the ranch it is also a customer favorite. Another good burger is the Cali burger which has fresh avocados on it. They have daily specials as well. Now for dessert don't forget to get a brownie that they make or a chocolate milk shake. For the kid in you they also have slush puppies they remind me of my childhood.   I would say the main reason we go back is the vibe of the restaurant. They are like your family and they make you feel at home. They are the reason you go back!! Keep up the great work Rocket Burger!!!",

This place is too clean for a \"Greasy or a Dive\" title, but there food reminds me of some of the BEST greasy/dives out there!    They have a wide variety of food choices and there menu doesn't tell the whole story, so you may need to ask some questions.  When I looked through their burgers I noticed the \"Eddie Lopez\".    To my surprise there is a better burger topping than bacon...  Hot Pastrami!!!  It was a mouth watering double burger that came with Hot Pastrami stacked on top of the two patties covered in melty-cheesy goodness, toppings and their thousand island dressing.  It was FANTASTIC!!   We also had the \"sub of the day\" ~ the Big Dipper.  The roast beef was delicious and it had just the right amount of cheese.  Their au jus dipping sauce was not good, but the sandwich was superb.  Their Au jus did not have a beefy taste, it was too thin, too hot and did not set well on the pallet with this sandwich.  Their fries are fresh but a bit too greasy for our taste.  Will try to get them well done on our next visit or try their onion rings.  Their cheese curds were very good!  They do have one of the largest selections of soda, pop in a bottle.  It's fun to try a soda you've never heard about before like an imported micro brew root beer or cream soda!  (Both were very good BTW)  Rocket Burger & Subs, even though it will be extremely hard for me to consider ordering something other than the Eddie Lopez burger, I'm looking forward to my next visit, trying something else and plan to bring some friends with me. If you have not tried RB&S, they are a solid place to \"Book Mark\"!  Yelpers, what is your favorite Rocket Burger or Sub??",

The lettuce was very finely shredded, onions were diced and blended well with the lettuce to add just the right amount to each bite. The bun was toasted lightly but still fluffy.   The onion rings were very good... corn meal breading that was light and crispy, the onion was soft but didn't pull out of the breading.   The cheese curds were amazing.  They were small, breading was very light and crispy.  The wall of soda is diverse and has something for everyone. I chose the Blenheim Ginger Ale pink cap (the spicier one). I was assisted with my choice which was great because I didn't know the difference between the options.  Staff was knowledgeable and very courteous.

Kind of an odd parking lot due to a Churches Chicken taking up most of the corner and HS kids are roaming around all the time. Just be patient and roll in.

Was. Amazing. The bread, it's always about the bread.. Perfection, amazing texture, kind of like Fuddruckers.  The meat patties were cooked perfectly and were delicious, especially with the fried egg bleeding yolk onto it. The kicker was the ghost pepper cheese, it was a good spicy, very flavorful, not hot just for the sake of being hot. Oh, and they have the largest selection of root beer you can possibly imagine, aaaand I got Dr Pepper.",

Oh-em-geeee! These were home made morsels of joy with a mouthwatering, well seasoned batter.   I ordered a veggie sub and everyone else ordered a burger. The burgers were raved about with every bite. My veggie sub on the other hand? Just so-so. The bread was really good and the quality and variety of veggies was good. Something just didn't work though... I think it didn't have enough mustard/ mayo/ sauce/ dressing. It needed something. And more cheese probably.  We also had fries and cheese curds on the side. Fries were fresh, not frozen. Yay! Cheese curds were tasty.  Soda wall was a bit insane. I'm not a soda person. I was getting a toothache just looking at this wall. I would prefer a beer wall...",

Their Teriyaki burger is sublime, among the best I've had (including \"gourmet\" burgers) and the fries are the perfect balance between crunchy and fluffy.   The selection of sodas are to die for, there's something for everyone.   Though the price is more expensive than a meal at In-N-Out, the difference is well worth it. I spend around $8-10 every time I eat there for a burger, fries, and a bottled drink or two.   This is definitely a must-have for anybody in the Phoenix area.",

The service is topnotch, the food is amazing, and the drink selection is up there with the best of them.   I went there for the first time two days ago with my Mom. I got the recommendation from a couple of friends who share the same love of this kind of food that I do. I ordered the Afterburner Burger and it exceeded my expectations. It had just the right amount of heat. I also ordered fries and onion rings and they did not disappoint. My mom ordered the reuben and it looked pretty good.  The food prices are cheap which made the food taste even better.  Not only is the food good, but they have a huge selection of vintage soda that would blow your mind. They receive extra points for having the Texas born \"Dublin Dr. Pepper\" in stock.   The owner doesn't talk much but the service is amazing. The ambiance is a little dive-y but it adds to the experience.   All in all, Rocket burger is a great restaurant to chow down on your favorite foods.",

They are a great price and you get a lot of sub for your buck.  The meat, bacon, cheese, lettuce, tomatoes, avocado, etc are stuffed into delicious whole wheat bread (they have other types of bread too) and the toppings practically over flow out of the sandwich.  This place is great because they have different types of food to please almost any one and it is all delish.  They have a good selection including burgers, subs, mini corn dogs, salads, gyros, fries, onion rings, etc etc that are all custom made to order.  The burgers are great and I tried the \"moo-yorker\" on a whim which was delicious.  The fries are fresh cut on site and the kitchen is open.  They also have a HUGE soda collection that has many different types of specialty sodas from all over the place.   I have gone to this restaurant many times and the atmosphere is laid back, casual, and down to the basics.  Good place to go if you have kids.  However, it is a smaller restaurant with limited seating. Also, if you are trying to impress a pretentious date this is probably not the spot for you. The people that work here are all very friendly, helpful, and has a family owner-ship vibe.    Basically.....  This restaurant has yummy food and great prices.  I definitely recommend that you stop by if your in the area!",

    "text": "Rocket burger has been on my bookmark/bucket list of places to try and this was my first time here today.  I got the cheese burger special for 4.99 includes fries and a drink , plus the 10% off if you check in through yelp . The cheeseburger had really good flavor it was dressed with the usual and what made it so special was the burger sauce. The sauce had a little bit of a kick , not too much but enough to make you want more. The only negative is the bun was too thick for my taste, but I ripped the inside of the bun and enjoyed the burger . The fries seems to be hand cut and I think they are cooked in some kind of veggie oil like Crisco.  They looked better than they tasted. Then again everyone has their own preference in what they think is a good French fry. Who knows it might be your cup of tea. Oh and by the way they had a crazy cool collection of soda pop.",

I turned around to try it because of good Yelp reviews and my curiosity regarding the variety of Soda Pop.  We both got a large hot pastrami sandwich and soda pop.  The price was reasonable, the food was good and the soda pop made it a nostalgic experience.  I brought home half of my sandwich.  Just reheated it in the microwave and enjoyed it again.  I'll return to try the french dip sandwich on the menu.  P.S.  The meat and secret sauce gave the sandwich a great bite.  It blows away the 'roast beef' sandwich I had last week at Subway that looked like reconstituted meat.",

Like ridiculously cheap for every menu option.  Not much ambiance, but for a great burger, who's complaining? I like the bare bones decor, and I'm sure the high school kids would destroy anything more than that. Speaking of high school kids, if you want to avoid those heathens try to make to Rocket Burger before 2:30pm!",

The Chicago dog was good. And the onion ring and fries were prob the worst I've had at a quick svc restaurant. This is my 5th bad yelp rec, and it's sad. No one likes to eat bad food.

You walk in the door and to your left are six refrigerator doors chocked full of about 250 different specialty sodas. All priced at a $1.89 and to your right there are the two owners and two helpers. One of the owners is at the cash register and handling the customer service and the other is that the sandwich table whipping up delicious hamburgers subs and the like. Very friendly and helpful!!!!!   While I was there I asked a couple questions of the owners. One was do they weigh the meat before they load it into the sandwich? The guy at the sandwich making table shook his head no and said we want to make it good. Indicating they just cut a lot in there until it looks right. Needless to say my sandwich was well portioned. Rand H. and I both got a Large Ruben on Sourdough and split an order of fries. I really like this place for a lot of reasons, some of which I noted in my review. While we were eating I saw a few more orders roll by and they were all generous servings that looked delish.",

After looking at a few places, we decided on Rocket Burger and Subs. When we walked through the door we were greated right away. Something I look for and think is very important. We were amazed at the soda selection! Some sodas I've haven't seen in YEARS! They even have Slush Puppies!!! What???? Yeppers, they sure do! We both decided on the birch beer. Sooooo good! I went simple and got a cheeseburger and fries. BF got a pastrami with cole slaw sandwich and fries. I have to agree with most on here and say the food here is outstanding! Very fresh and full of flavor. The fries were not greasy nor the burgers salty. And I for one do not use or like salt very much. I love how the skin was left on the fries! Very yummy! We will definitely be back when we have a craving for really good burgers and fries! Oh and if you check in on Yelp you get 10% off!!!",

Tons of great choices. $1.99 per bottle. I guess that's the going price, but wish it was less... Pretty gross location and the inside was clean but smelled of grease. I guess I should of assumed that walking in.  It's not terrible, but not great. Prices were decent overall and the service was fast and friendly.

Another burger experience I recommend trying, if feeling daring is the Gyro burger, this thing is about the size of 4 burgers in one and is topped with homemade tzatziki sauce.  Now for the endless soda pop flavors, whatever you can think of they pretty much have it.  I recommend trying the So Duh! Liquid Fire flavor, tastes just like you're sucking on an atomic fireball candy (Crazy, but fun).  Place looks a lil rough on the outside, but don't let that fool you as I recommend any  Burger Fanatic to try!",

If you didn't know what you where looking for, you would miss it. You'd best not however, because it's that good!   The menu is a mix of burgers, sandwiches and hot dogs. You can have fries or onion rings, and then there is your drink selection, that's where you can be sure of having some fun making up you mind. If you are a fan of nostalgia and love the old and new, you can rest assured that they will have something that will satisfy both. There is everything from cream soda's to root beer, they even have chocolate soda!   I had the classic bacon cheese burger with onion rings. The burger was cooked just right with extra crispy pieces of bacon melted cheese, lettuce, tomato and pickles. The onion rings was coated with corn meal batter and fried to golden brown. It was a great choice.   The locals seemed to be happy, service was great, and owner seemed genuinely interested in who was eating at his place and how we had discovered it.

    "text": "Much like Google search words, Hot, Spicy, Jalapeno, Habanero, \"Don't do it\", on a menu make me salivate like Pavlov's dog.  Most of the time I'm mildly amused or deeply unsatisfied with the level of heat and flavor from whatever it is I've ordered.  Enter the Afterburner burger from Rocket Burger.  Pepper jack cheese, horseradish mayo, fresh jalapenos, rocket relish, lettuce, tomato, pickle, onions.  Your stomach, not you, should be required to sign off on this before consumption begins.  The horseradish mayo was atomic horseradish, I know because I use it in my cocktail sauce at home.  This is not for young children or those that eat like them.  As powerful as the burger was, it wasn't that memorable or something I would want to go back for.  The bun was a little oversized for a single burger, I think they must sell a lot of doubles or bigger so the buns are probably completely right-sized for those, but both me and The Princess thought the buns were a little large.  The P had a basic burger, no cheese,  just tomato, mustard, catsup and she thought the burger was passable.  She loved the fries, I thought they were ok.  As it's been well documented on Yelp, the soda collection is legendary, you name it or want a certain flavor of soda, it's probably there, cold and ready to enjoy.  It's most likely the largest collection of bottle soda pop in the state.  This is my second time here and I feel like I'm missing something for a joint that has 4.5 stars.  I'd much rather enjoy a great burger from Lenny's or Five Guys (the Five Guys little burger with everything and jalapenos is one of my all-time favorite burgers).  I'll come back one last time and try a dog (thanks for the tip Mark R!).  Until then, a solid three stars.",

Nothing fancy here (and it sits to the side of a Church's chicken, not a Canes - and I've never had any issue with ample parking). That said, I don't come here for the ambiance, I come here for the food!   Their service is second only to their burgers, and while the burger patty itself is nothing special, the combinations of toppings and styles they offer are nothing short of spectacular for the price. Also, if you're a fan of fried zucchini - this is *the* place. The amount of food you get is more than satisfactory and man does it taste good!!  It's small, but it's clean. It's super friendly, reasonably priced, and ... well... it's wonderful! It would be hard to go wrong in here, highly recommended!",

Finding out that the Pop Shop has become part of Rocket Burger & Subs is a wonderful bonus:  imagine choosing from over 200 soft drinks for a memorable meal.

Their cold case of a million sodas and drink options is cool...next time I will investigate.  Two thumbs up for sure.",

The fries were good. One thing I did not appreciate about the place was the guy behind the wall who was cooking (manager or owner) was really micromanaging the people up front. I was just waiting there until they had a moment but he was like you need to help, you need help and he was just kind of rude to his employees. They were helping and he was just making a scene. that was a turnoff for me and I probably won't return because of that.",

They are a little hard to find as they are tucked in the back in the corner of a building complex.  But if you do find this little gem eatery you will not be disappointed.

The customer service was amazing the cooks literally brought our food to us and the manager checked in multiple times to make sure we were satisfied. Did I mention the root beer?! They had at least 20+ varieties of bottled root beer ranging from flavored to original rootbeer, if you're looking for a quality burger joint I suggest you stop by here, whether you're a local or out here travelling this is a must stop spot, so good you'll be asking how to invest!!!",

Luckily it wasn't super busy because we had a large party of kids and trying to get all their orders was something of an ordeal and then the adults all wanted something modified. But our cashier deftly handled our entire order and didn't skip a beat or become frustrated. Yea!!! We ordered quite the variety of grilled cheese and hot dogs, corn dogs and chilli dogs for the kids. I had the double California burger with avocado and loved it. Super messy with fries to soak up everything. The soda bar was pretty special with the natural sugar sodas which tasted much better then the regular sodas. You would be hard pressed to not find a soda you like here. I can't wait to come back to try another concoction on their menu. Awesome!!!",

    "text": "I've wanted to try this place based on the Yelp reviews. Bad decision! I honestly had to think twice about going in this place. It's not well lit in the parking lot and there were, in my opinion, unsavory people hanging around outside asking for change.  So, against my better judgement, I went in and was a bit confused at the theme/decor. I thought it was a liquor store, at first glance, but quickly realized it was an assortment of craft sodas. They even have two types of self serve soda stations. One, with the typical sodas (Cherry Pepsi, Tropicana lemonade, etc) and the other had craft soda flavors like Shirley Temple, Black Cherry  and a few others. I filled my cup with the Shirley Temple...yum.  When you go to order, there was an older guy standing/waiting at the counter to take your order. Don't expect any suggestions, even after advising it was my first time there and that the sandwich menu was \"overwhelming \". It wasn't until I asked for a vegan option that he advised for an upcharge of $1, I could substitute a veggie pattie. I did. I ordered the California burger with the veggie pattie. It had Avocado, lettuce, tomato and something similar to a Comeback sauce which I got on the side.  $12+ later/lighter and I couldn't eat the fries because they were too hard, dry and old. The color tells me the grease should be changed. The burger initially looked delicious, but I judged the book by its cover. The bun and lettuce was fresh, but the veggie pattie was dry and some parts were inedible. Long story short, I threw it all away. The best part of the meal was the craft soda .  My only regret is that I forgot to mention Yelp for a 10% discount.  Maybe if I ate beef I would have had a better experience, but that's no excuse for bad fries. It's sacrilege. Overpriced and disgusting! Buyer beware and take security.",

The burger patties are now thin and tasteless, the pastrami tough, ask for crispy bacon get it half cooked and a half-hearted offer to make a new one. The food just so-so. They tout their new 24 flavors of icecream. That is a joke too. They take vanilla soft serve out it in a hopper with a squirt of flavoring and then it comes out and goes into a cone. The problem is that it makes it melt so you have half frozen ice cream which still tastes like vanilla. And if you ask for sprinkles they throw that in the hopper too so it is in the icecream which is weird. So I have now paid $5.50 for these tiny gross cones. I could have gone to a QT and gotten a cone for $.99 for all that. The employees don't seem to care either. This is most likely our last time for awhile. There are plenty of better places to go to.",

I always make sure to steal a bite of Andy F's rocket burger (it's three patties! on a sub roll! so epic). Part of the fun of eating at Rocket Burger is spending way too long examining all the soda options - last time, I found a dandelion soda, but was just too chicken to try it (but YOU should - and tell me about it!)  The owners and staff are lovely, and you can tell they really care about this place. Andy and I actually had a really terrible experience our first time here (waited an hour + for food that was cold on arrival, etc), and when Andy yelped about it, the owner reached out. He said there was no excuse for the terrible service, but he'd instituted some changes and hoped we'd come back. We've been back a dozen times since that fateful day, and never once have we regretted it!   Well, I regret not having tried all the sodas. But I feel I made a valiant effort!",

Probably the only disappointing thing is that the last time we went their cheese curds were overly salty. Note I have a HIGH tolerance for salt, and this was even too much for me, it was extremely over the top. Let them know about it through email and they never did respond which is disappointing, but considering how good everything else is here I'll let it slide.",

I had a single cheeseburger, I liked everything except the rocket sauce...no matter what you call it, it's 1000 island on all these burgers (In/Out, McD's and every other burger place with special sauce is either straight up 1000 island or some variant of it), and normally I like it; however, I did not care for this particular version. It was watery.  I did like the actual burger.  Again, I'm a lover of onion rings and I was super excited to see all the great reviews, until I actually tried them. I didn't care for them at all.

    "text": "Okay, let's get this straight...there are pros and cons here.  Pro: I think they have more soda than Rocket Fizz. It's all refrigerated and ready to drink! Pro: They have a Santa Fe Burger which involves a battered, deep-fried green chili which is utter genius. I repeat, Utter Genius. Pro: The burgers are well-crafted with attention to detail and carefully laid out, not assembled by an uncaring worker and squished into a wrapper quickly. Pro: They have Pepsi products on fountain in case for some reason ~300 types of bottled soda (most made with Real Cane Sugar OH YEAH) just doesn't do it for you and you need to blend your own suicide-soda. Pro: They will make any soda you want into a float, using soft-serve, for a buck! Pro: Locally-owned by a guy who seems pretty nice and genuinely interested in his customers and their thoughts. That's a HUGE PLUS, people...pay attention!  Pro: The burgers' pickles are good! they don't taste like run-of-the-mill, cheap, food purveyor 5 gallon bucket pickles. Pro: They have a website that seems to be pretty current, it alerted me to the fact that they have some of the last remaining Dublin Dr. Pepper in the world and I should buy now. (Disclosure: While I like Dr. Pepper - I'm not a superfan, and have never tried it - so I figured the $15/6packs were better left to the superfans and collectors). Pro: The building seems to be laid out in an \"L\" fashion, with the soda selection and main tables on one side; and an 'extra\" area of seating on the other side of the kitchen that seems to have a pass-thru ordering window. That probably comes in pretty handy during lunch rush when the kids from the hi-skool next door probably mob the place. We didn't notice this until we were leaving...so I'll have to explore that next time.  Con: The signs telling you about the $1 float options are too high to notice until you've already ordered. Perhaps this is another stroke of genius to encourage repeat business, perhaps its an oversight. Con: It's an older property, so it doesn't have that super-clean feeling about it. It's not dirty by any means...but it's at that stage of life where its not sterile, but not quite yet charming. Of course, this whole part of town is at that stage - so you can't really hold that against the place. Con: Soft-serve rather than real ice cream.  It's not that I hate soft-serve, I give it its credit...but I prefer real ice cream. (Disclosure: if they used real ice cream, I'd probably bitch about that too, because I'm kind of a dairy snob). Con: Shoestring potatoes. I know they have the skin on, and are natural-cut, and shoestrings have millions of loyal followers...I'm not one of them. Give me a tater-tot any day.  Other things of note: My single burger was BIG. You can also go double or Rocket Burger, which is 3 patties on a sub roll. I can't imagine eating that - but I'm sure its a fave amongst many!  Bottom line: Pros obviously outweigh cons and the fact that it is a family-owned/run business always weights positive in my book! We'll be back.",

    "text": "I just tried Rocket Burger for the first time after reading some great things on here, but it didn't quite match my expectations.  The main reason that I think this place is rated too high is that the food is just average. The sauce on the burger is nice, but there is nothing else really special about the burger and the fries are kind of lousy.  The service however is pretty good. The guys working here are certainly friendly, so I am all for supporting an independent location like this. The various sodas they have here are cool to look at, but a little overwhelming. I couldn't figure out what to get or what was supposed to be good, so I just stuck with a regular fountain Pepsi.  The location of the place is not very good and it looks more like a convenient store than a restaurant. That was one thing I didn't like about eating here. It was an alright experience on the whole though.",

I had the garlic melt burger combo which included fries and a fountain drink. The burger was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. The bun was super fresh and soft. It had garlic mayo, bacon, grilled onions and mushrooms on it. They have craft soda on tap by Batch Craft Soda out of California which is made with real sugar and was delicious. The fries ( which are great!) are hand cut thin with the skins still on them. The woman behind the counter was very nice and the cook that bright me my food was as well.

The bacon was cooked to the right amount of crispness and the bun tasted fresh baked (although I didn't verify)  The meats on my Italian sandwich were awesomely thick cut. If I get this sandwich again I'll probably ask for some Italian dressing on the side to dip.   Little guy's hot dog was HUGE!!! The outside skin was nice and crisp so it snapped when you bite into it.   In addition to the regular fountain drinks, they have a set of specialty fountains that contain root beer, black cherry, ginger beer, etc as well as hundreds of bottled specialty sodas.

    "text": "Heard these rocket burgers take you to the moon and back so I said why not give 'em a try!  Location & Aesthetics - located in Phoenix just off W Cactus Road at the intersection of N 35th & W Cactus Road.  The business is behind a Raising Cane's and I almost missed it as I had to swing around on N 35th Ave. Parking was on the dismal side and there weren't enough spots available.  Luckily, I snagged that last remaining parking spot.  I'm unsure where I would've parked if there weren't any available spots....perhaps in Raising Cane's parking area (-1). Interior decor is interesting as they have pictures of famous figures from sports and other areas with the accompanying prices of things from yesteryear, e.g. the cost of a soda in the '40's or '50's. Seating was adequate and comfortable, and the dining areas was clean.  Along one wall was lined a wide selection of soda pop which was interesting.  Many different names and bottle shapes that is a must see if visiting.   One negative was the dining area was on the small side so if you're coming with a party of more than 5, you may have to put some of the tables and chairs together (-1), and sadly there's no outdoor seating.  Menus - posted on a chalk board above the cashier who also takes your orders.  There are more detailed menus on the countertop which we were given.        Service - Staff was very warm and welcoming, and answered any questions we had about the menu items. If dining in, staff will bring your food to the table.    Food - I had the double cheeseburger, fries and a strawberry shake.   The shake tasted like there were real strawberries used, very creamy and thick, and very well mixed.   The fries looked they were freshly cut with the potato skin still on them - crunchy, well seasoned, tasty, not too overcooked or limp, and not over salted. The burger was juicy, well seasoned, tasty, not very greasy or runny, and cooked perfectly.  I am interested in trying some of their other inventions and will probably return though will probably order for take-out because of the lack of parking!",

Their food is top notch for what you would consider a fast food joint.   FOOD: So I have tried a few items on the menu over the years. My absolute favorite used to be their Tuna Sub that was discontinued because I was told that not enough people were ordering it and they were wasting a bunch of tuna. Which is sad because the sub was amazing and just great. I did try a Ruben Sandwich once and wasn't too keen on it. I mainly didn't care for it just because I took it home and the bread was soggy, but the meat and flavor was amazing. My new favorite food item on their menu is the Garlic Melt Burger. The flavor is incredible and the burgers are always cooked just right. Don't forget to grab an order of their cheese fries. They are terrible for you, but they taste amazing and are well worth it. Of course you cannot forget about the ridiculously wide selection of soda pops that you can buy and try.   SERVICE: I have never had any issues with service here. The staff is primarily all the original workers who are awesome and really dedicated to some great food.   OVERALL: Rocket Burger is an incredible neighborhood spot to stop by and grab a soda and burger. They have a ton of menu options for food to try that are all good. I wish they would bring the tuna back, but completely understand. I would highly recommend this place to anyone and I have suggested it for years now.",

From the street this small shop is located in the corner of a strip mall and I actually drove past it because it's so unassuming and easy to miss from the main street. The whole back wall is filled with so many different soda brands, organized by flavor.   The menu was quite comprehensive and due to the lunch line that was forming behind me, I decided to be basic and just ordered a single cheeseburger and onion rings. The burger patty was thin with a lot of bread so I think I now know why they offer double or triple patties to order. The side of onion rings was huge and they came served with two sides of ranch - score!   My favorite part of this experience was all of the cool soda flavors and I am super stoked they sell a staple from my home state, Faygo pop, here!",

    "text": "My wife and I were jones'ing for a burger joint and this place popped up in my Yelp feed.  We had never been and decided to give it a shot. It's a fairly convenient location and it looks like to-go orders are the bulk of their business.  The restaurant itself is clean, but not much for atmosphere or ambiance.  I've no idea what it used to be, but it's a long narrow building.  Convenient store?  Liquor store?  Laundromat?  I've absolutely no idea, but there's not much for relaxation.  Probably not a place you'd go for a 1st date, but that's OK.    We ordered when we got there and only waited 10 minutes or so.  I went with the Chicago-style burger and it did not disappoint.  Burger was juicy and flavorful.  The fries were a healthy portion in a large piece of foil.  Not soggy.  Not burned.  Very flavorful and seasoned to perfection.  Not quite as many fries as the shitload you get from the cooks at Five Guys, but still a healthy portion of french fries.  Service was friendly, attentive and our order was accurate.  Definitely a step above fast food and we shall be back for another to-go / takeout order!",

Rocket Burger offers hand made burgers, subs and specialty hot dogs that are exactly what you'd expect form a mom and pop restaurant with dive-vibes. Burgers are real beef patties and offer the expected as well as a few surprises, my personal favorite is the New Yorker which is a hand patty piled high with NY pastrami and coleslaw from scratch. If you want something a bit spicier, go for Santa Fe which comes with fried green chilies just like New Mexico. If you're from the upper Midwest the cheese curds cannot be skipped- the best cheese curds in the Valley.",

I like a good juicy burger, but if there is one nit pick I have for this place it's that the burger was quite messy. Certainly not a bad thing really, just required a lot of napkins to keep it off of my face!  I also appreciate they had a hand crafted soda fountain with some unusual flavors.  I'd certainly return here anytime I want a burger and I'm in the area!",

The setting is casual but unique. When you walk in they have cases and cases filled with over a hundred unique sodas; ones you've never tried before. So when you order your food, grab a soda too!   I always order their sandwiches and my boyfriend usually orders their burgers. My favorite is the California Club. I'm sad that I dug in too fast and didn't get a photo! His burgers are always huge and smell amazing. The fries and onion rings are a must try too. They have a huge menu and the options are very wide. They also do ice cream in slushees!

You will not walk away disappointed, you will, however, walk away with a major food coma. Countering your food coma, you can get hyped with their large variety of sodas. A selection of sodas which have not seen the light of day since Baby Boomers roamed the Earth in the hundreds of millions.   Remember folks this isn't health food, this is the food you eat when you know the consequences all too well but continue on your death march. Because honestly, life is too short to not enjoy yourself every once in a while. Cheat meal, OH YES.",

    "text": "Nestled in a decrepit strip mall next to an auto loan place is a burger shop that screams...       \"Go away! We were shut down by the health department! Stay away! Leper! Leper!\"       Do not listen to those wailing cries in your head. That is to scare away mundane eaters who like boring, institutional burger chains with their consistently average products that are advertised nationally. Once you get past the exterior and enter the doorway, you will find the Willy Wonka Chocolate Factory of burger greatness.       The Philly Steak Burger was amazing. The bacon cheeseburger was among the best I've ever had, with a very slight spice that may have come from the savory pickles they put on it. In addition, this place has the largest collection of bottled soda and (non-alcoholic) beverages I have ever seen. All of which you can purchase to consume with your masterfully made meal.        You can order your burgers as a 'single', a 'double' or something called a 'rocket'. Find our for yourself what that last one means.       What cinches the deal is the price. Killer burgers at a reasonable price.        Tip #1: If you get a brownie for dessert, ask them to heat it up and put ice cream on it.       Tip #2: If you get there on a week day at about 3:00 or later expecting it to be empty as it's between lunch and dinner, take heed the a local school gets out just before that time and it shall not be as empty as you think- not just students but teachers and coaches frequent this place.",

Rocket Burger is one of our favorite places to stop in to eat or just grab a couple of the MANY bottle sodas they sell. Upon walking in we immediately noticed they did a little re-model and moved the kitchen area back so it opens up the dining area a little. I also noticed it was a lot quieter & cooler inside. They also put a wall up that they are going to be selling some of their sodas by the 4 or 6 pack. My BF was excited to hear that so now we can stock up on some of his favorites at home.  Like I said, we have been here many times but this time I tried the Afterburner Burger & OMG was it good! It had just the right amount of hot flavor but not too much to where you couldn't eat & enjoy it. He got a Bacon Rocket Burger that was good as well. We always get the chili cheese fries with the chili on the side & like always they were delicious!  Don't be discouraged by the location or outside appearance of Rocket Burger, it's a small family business ran by nice people who serve good food!",

Of course I had to get it \"Rocket\" style though.  The burger plus an order of fries could have easily been a challenge on Man vs. Food.  With that said I couldn't finish the fries and burger which is a rarity for me.  For about ten bucks it was a pretty good value and well worth it.  The burger was well seasoned, cooked perfectly and wasn't greasy.  The bun held up great so I didn't make a mess of my shirt as is almost always the case when I have a burger.  I will definitely return because the Eddie Lopez burger has my name all over it!",

Recently, however, I'm not sure if I can still think of it as 4-star, because of the inconsistency that appears to have woefully only happened to me based on these reviews.  The last burger I ordered looked and smelled wonderful until I picked it up and so much rocket sauce ran out that I considered hooking up my pool draining equipment to siphon some of it out. Rather overpowering. After scraping some off, I took a bite and holy black pepper! It was like an employee played a prank and unscrewed the top of the pepper shaker and instead of making a new burger thought \"eh, they might like coughing and gasping for breath while army-crawling to the sink for water\". After shoveling off the pepper, I enjoyed the burger. They have great buns and I know great buns, because I do daily squat thrusts.  Well, aside from the fact that half of the burger was medium-rareish (I like) and the other half well-done (nooo!). Not sure how that was managed.  Fries: completely inedible. The oil was obviously not hot enough. The only texture was soggy followed by waves of oil coating my mouth.  I'll keep occasionally going there, but probably never at nights again. The kitchen staff looked rather young. I recall that I used to stop by on school day afternoons, back when I would have easily given this pace 4-stars.",

They were out of cheese curds, straws and Dr. Pepper - The only soda I will drink. Supposedly they're known for having \"the biggest soda selection in Phoenix.\" Don't make me laugh.

Then there is the infamous Rocket Burger. You can get any burger turned into a Rocket Burger (on a sesame seed sub bun) it is delicious but you have to have a huge stomach.  Sometimes I will stop in just to get a 6 pack of soda and then spend 20 minutes deciding which one I want. I believe I counted approx 360+ sodas?  They also have slush puppies, I have not seen or had these since I was a kid.  I would love to see this place expand it is awesome. All of the food I have tried was extremely good.  My kids beg to come here for dinner all the time!  ...Why are you still reading this and not driving to this place? GO!!!",

    "text": "We are from So. Cal., have travelled far/wide in southwest/more & have never had as good a green chile cheeseburger anywhere. This scrumcious burger is called the Santa Fe Burger. Veggies (tomatoes, onions pickles), cheese, fried green chile, bacon & rocket sauce. The depth, taste, & texture was amazing. Served hot in a perfect crunchy outside/soft inside bun! Was not sure about a fried chile, thinking it may be heavily dipped/fried, but it was 'heavenly' breaded & fried to perfection, not oily, but fairly thick & crisp, adding another dimension to the old standby found in many New Mexico burger shops. Don't think it was the unsurpassed New Mexico Hatch chili which is the only thing that would improve this outstanding burger. I had the single which I could not finish because of its size & hubby had the double which he did finish. Num!  Fries were not memorable. Oil not hot enough, I believe.  They wilted as they cooled.  Next time we'll try the onion rings, zucchini, or mushrooms. Apparently for these other veggies, they use the same coating as the above-mentioned chili in the burger.    We stuck w/ the regular soda machine, but hundreds of choices in chilled bottles are behind glass to choose from.  Wish we were staying one more night so we could go back and totally ruin our diets! Ha!  Excellent price points, as well. Get yourselves over there before they have to expand to a pricier market.",

The chili cheese fries were a disaster. Also, I thought it was lame that they charged me a dollar extra to do half n half on two items that were the same price. Greed isn't something that scores extra stars on Yelp. The service wasn't very good. The cook kept coming out and talking to people he knew in the dining area so our food took a long time.   Would I go back- yes Would I recommend the burgers- absolutely Would I tip them- hell no! Need better service  Nice selection of sodas you probably have never seen or heard of too! I love Root beer and they have an entire fridge full to choose from.   Overall incredible burger. Anything fried I would stay away from and wouldn't get the chili cheese fries, they are soggy and the chili is poor.   Still worth it for the burgers tho, prices are reasonable as well.",

    "text": "Who doesn't love a good neighborhood burger joint?  I will emphasize the \"good\" and \"joint\" on this one because chances are even this little hole-in-the-wall will surprise you.  I had seen the great reviews on Yelp as well as the Phoenix New Times about this place, so I decided to take a chance on grabbing lunch here on a Friday.  I was a little apprehensive about coming just because of the proximity to Moon Valley High School (it's literally next door).  Lunch + Friday + high school conjures up images of when I and hoards of classmates used to go to our favorite lunch spots with friends during high school.  Worse yet, the place is in a tiny old strip mall with almost no parking.  Shockingly, the place wasn't busy at all and I easily got a parking spot.  When you walk in you almost feel like you've stumbled upon an old convenience store as you immediately notice the soda machines, the large refrigerator area full of soda, and even the soda six packs on the shelves.  Notice a theme here?  Yeah, they've got A LOT of soda.  In fact they claim to have the widest variety of sodas to choose from in the state.  As in the entire state of Arizona!  I have no way of verifying this claim, but I did indeed see many soda brands and flavors I had never seen before from chocolate to watermelon, to lemon, and on and on.  If you're a soda junkie, you'll be in heaven here.  But I came for one reason, the burgers.  They actually have a variety of hot dogs, gyros, and submarine sandwiches as well, but its Rocket \"Burger\".  I saw one person eating a Rocket sized burger which is insanely huge (basically a submarine burger sandwich with at least 4 patties by my count).  I wasn't feeling that bold so I went with a bacon double cheeseburger instead and got a side of fries.  The burger was excellent.  Hearty portion with plenty of cheese and bacon and their special sauce (basically a rendition of thousand island from what I could tell).  The fries were pretty average so nothing special there.  All totaled, the burger, fries and a drink were $8.  The dining area is pretty small with tables, chairs and a couple of booth.  But like I said, it wasn't crowded and I was easily able to get a seat.  I was in and out in about 20 minutes  Overall, a pretty cool place and certainly unique to the west side of town.  The fries were really the only big negative of this place.  Burger was great, prices are right, and the soda selection will blow your mind.",

All the ingredients were well balanced. The pastrami in the burger was so tender and juicy. The coleslaw had a lot of great flavor to it, along with the tasty sauce.   I really enjoyed the French fries. Some of my favorite french fries.   My husband had the Cali burger. The cheese in it looked so luscious on top of the patties, bacon, and avocado that I had to try it. I definitely recommend the Cali and new york burger. The bread, ingredients, and protein were all incredibly delicious and my taste buds can concur! ;)",

The claim to fame at Rocket Burger & Subs, I would say, isn't the Burgers or the Subs... It's the assortment of soda. That rhymed. See how I did that? Assortment of Sodas. Sorry, I'm easily distracted.   Anyhow, there are so many sodas. I had heard about this soda assortment. There I go rhyming again like P-Diddy. But I don't think you can really appreciate it until you see it.   Being a craft beer fan, I first tried a root beer made by Abita, a brewer based out of Louisiana. I don't even consider myself a liker of root beer but it was a solid choice.   As far as food, I got a chili dog which was good, but didn't knock my socks off because I was wearing sandals. Flip flops, I think... because I'm classy.   I did however really like the fried mushrooms. So good. The breading tastes like they surely make it in house. Being from the south originally it reminded me of the breading used on really good fried green tomatoes. So what am I saying here? I'm saying I would like the owner of RBS to consider making fried green tomatoes. But if they don't, it's fine because they also have a fried zucchini that is fantastic.   I couldn't get get through the meal with out a second soda so I got a Swamp Pop Cola, another Louisiana drink. I didn't plan the Louisiana soda theme, but it worked out because it was pretty good as well.  Will I be back to Rocket Burgers and Subs? Yep! As many times as possible.   Will I put on at least 10 pounds due to these visits? Yep! Don't judge me...",

We were the only people in the place and all our food was luke warm or room temprature.  The patties were very thin and thinking I would get pickled jalapenos on my burger they were actually raw. Every burger place I have been has never had raw jalapenos - maybe I should have asked or maybe they shoul post they are raw.  The onion rings batter was not even batter it tasted more like cornmeal and they were room temperature - should be hot.  The buns were hard and not soft at all.  Our first time is our last time there. Sorry but very poor food quality.",

You won't get the most high end burger in the valley but you'll get 100% angus flat patties that are prepared to your likening  and are delicious with several choices of sizes and toppings. Besides burgers they offer sandwiches, subs, beef hot dogs, soft serve, floats and the biggest selection of bottled sodas I've ever seen. Portions are very large and prices aren't much more than fast food. You are getting food that's MUCH Better than fast food.  After watching RB&S on Check Please Arizona I went with what everyone else tried the popular NY Double Burger with fries. I liked that they carefully toasted the buns and the burgers were prepared medium just like I asked for and were juicy and tasty. A generous amount of tasty grilled pastrami and house made slaw and rocket sauce topped the burger. It was all good tasty and humungous and a giant amount of fresh cut fried potatoes were yummy too.   Check out Rocket Burger!  It's a Blast!",

Decent sized patty covered with thin slices of steak, peppers, onions, and a gooey slice of cheese melted on top and all inside a toasty bun...DELISH!!  Also ordered a side of fried zucchini, which I thought was really good, but a little on the greasy side.  If you like a good greasy burger, then this may be your place.  The decor isn't very fancy, but they have a huge soda selection, and several different burger choices.",

    "text": "This review is based on a recent, first time visit to Rocket Burger.  Pros  - Friendly Service - Amazing Cola Selection - Hole in the Wall vibe  Cons - the Rocket Burger  On recommendation from the staff, I ordered their flagship burger the Rocket New York which is three patties on a 12 in sub with pastrami, cheese, and cole slaw. No fries (too much food already) and a root beer. I believe I paid about $14 bucks.  So the burger was huge and I was exited to get into it. However, I was disappointed with the quality of the meats. The pastrami was super salty and chewy, and I had to take it off the sandwitch after two bites. The burger meat was low grade, fatty, thin, and had an awful brown-granular texture too it. Fresh meat should have a reddish glow to it. This tasted it like was frozen, defrosted, cooked, refrozen, and reheated. The slaw was drown in mayo sauce. The bread was the best part. Nice sub roll with just enough crust on it. I eat half and had to stop. Not because I was full, but because I was getting an ulcer. I took the other half to go, and toss it. Felt bad tossing it in the store because the staff was friendly.   I will most likely return because of the service and potiental I saw on the menu. Get a single or double burger, on a roll, simple toppings, and a fancy root beer. Hopefully it will be better and I can update this review to a 5!!!!!",

Got a Double Afterburner and a Single Chilli burger with onion rings. The guy at the counter, who I think is one of the owner's, was VERY nice and polite. If you are a fan of soda, they have a HUGE selection of about 300 different sodas to choose from. I grabbed a 4-pack of Jones Blue Cream Soda for about $7.50 (!).  NASTY!  The onion rings were coated in a VERY thin layer of disgusting batter. it was of a dark brown colour and not very good at all. Both of my burgers (I love food) had soggy buns and were not very good at all. I don't recommend this place at all. I would rather eat at In & Out.",

The shredded lettuce paired with their house sauce made me feel like I was eating coleslaw. Maybe thats what they were going for? If so- congrats. If not- fix it.   The fries were nothing special either. Greasy and not overly flavorful. Sometimes you get those greasy fries that you can feel how hard you will have to workout to get rid of them, but it is soooo worth it. These not so much. Drenched in grease and blah in flavor.

The portion sizes are freaking big and we ordered the smallest burgers! I can't even imagine what the rocket size looks like.

Originally gave them 4/5 stars after my first visit because you need to buy two of their hotdogs to fill up and now having gone there many times, I feel stupid for ever giving such a place only 4 stars when it clearly deserves 5. The hotdogs, while delicious, are the least interesting thing on the menu (although I recommend this place if you're in the mood for a gourmet hotdog).   Their burgers however, are PHENOMENAL! In n' Out has NOTHING on this place (and I love In n' Out). There are a bunch to choose from, reasonably priced and so full of flavor they can only be described as MIND BLOWING. The fries are the best I've ever had as well, seasoned to perfection and cooked just right, just like their burgers. Definitely the best burger place I've ever been too in my entire life.   Also, they have a gigantic wall full of designer soda's from all around the world, I believe they are only $2 a pop (no pun intended) or $1 upgrade onto a combo meal.  All in all, if you live in Phoenix you are blessed to be able to eat here on a regular basis, if you are passing through or here temporarily it is an experience you'll never forget.",

I remember going to this joint about a year ago with some co-workers and decided to head on over again. The place seems to have grown since I was there a year ago. The counter seems to be back more than before but maybe I'm just going crazy.  Anyway, on to the experience! I was quickly helped at the counter by a very nice guy who took my order.  I ended up getting the Eddie Lopez Burger which had a SUPER tasty burger,  pastrami and is topped with lettuce, tomato, onion, pickle, swiss, and rocket dressing!  The only bad part was the part when it was all gone!  I also ordered the Onion Rings. I am not even a fan of onion rings but I had to give them a try since everyone suggested them. Wow! There was a pile of them and they were so good!  Next time I'm getting a double!  Forget going to any of those franchise burger places, hit this place up and be prepared to drool!",

We were surprised they had that one and a huge selection of other ones to boot! Including a chocolate maple bacon one, and some weird flavors we couldn't help but snap chat.  We had the burger (I think santa fe??) with cole slaw, salsa, and avocado. The service was quick, and the burger was to die for! Along with it, we had the cajun fries. We will certainly be coming back for more!!",

I've passed by a number of times with the promise of the Latina Meat Market which never opened or closed before I had the chance to go in. Anyhoo, I ordered a double cheeseburger with fries and a can of Diet Coke.  It took a little bit even though I was one of four patrons in the restaurant, but I'll accept that in that it means they cook your meal to order.  Good thin patty burger and thin natural cut fries, though the bun was a bit large.  I'm not a big exotic soda pop fan, but as previously noted if you are they've got probably 6-8 big coolers worth of everything from cream soda to energy drinks to regional colas. The only issue I had with this place hit about 12:15 when a swarm of teenagers descended upon the restaurant and all of a sudden it's completely packed and noisy as all hell.  Guess the adjacent Moon Valley High isn't a closed campus...",

    "text": "Have I got a place for you un-health conscious, frugal foodies out there!  Rocket Burger and Subs serves up huge sandwiches and fried delights for astonishingly low prices, and much of the food is home-made. There's also an enormous section of unusual soft drinks; for instance, there's over two dozen brands of root beer to choose from. Dennis, one of the owners worked for A&W for 8 years, so he probably has root beer running through his veins by now.        I saw Rocket Burger in a listing of new valley eateries, then did a little research. The reviews I saw were all stellar, so I knew we had to give it a try. It doesn't look like much, inside or out - it's in a little strip mall tucked behind Churches Chicken at 35th Ave. and Cactus. But it's clean, and everybody is helpful and pleasant. Ken gave a happy whoop when he saw Cheese Curds ($2.49/$4.49) on the menu. We decided to get an order while waiting for our friends Randy and Marty to join us. The curds came quickly out of the kitchen, piping hot, served with some tasty homemade marinara. They were a touch greasy, as they should be, and the oil was fresh. Marty and Randy arrived in time to save us from ourselves by helping to finish off the curds. Then we took a while trying to make our selections from the extensive menu. Eventually Randy and I both went for the New Yorker: pastrami with homemade slaw and thousand island dressing ($2.99, $3.99 or $4.99). Ken had a homemade-meatball  sub, with more of that good marinara and some provolone. It was the same price structure as our New Yorkers and all the rest of the entries under Classic Subs and Sandwiches. Marty went with a double burger ($3.89, the singles are $1 less). He could have opted for a Rocket Burger - !0 inch sub with three burgers and the fixings in either plain, cheese, bacon, teriyaki, or chili style ($4.99 to $5.99). Of course we had to try the fries and onion rings.       Again our food arrived quickly, served in plastic baskets. It became very quiet, except for the occasional growl of pleasure. The onion rings ($1.99) had been dipped in a thin cornmeal batter which made them nice and crunchy.  The handcut fries ($1.49) were skinny, the way I like them. Randy thought they were undersalted, but I thought they were fine - our usual disagreement. At any rate, they disappeared quickly. Unlike the sandwiches. They were so big that we all ended up taking half of each sub home. The slaw on the New Yorkers was delicious, as was my whole wheat sub roll. The meat balls were nice and tender, and there was plenty of cheese on top. Randy had found a bottle of ginger beer imported from Australia that had a wonderfully refreshing True ginger taste. There seemed to be actual pieces of ginger in it - instructions on the label said to invert the bottle before opening. It never did tell you to turn it right side up again - the Aussies give us more credit than we deserve.        Other food items available: Hebrew National hot dogs in several styles ($2.49), Pizza   Bread with various toppings, Gyros ($3.69), salads ($1.99 - $3.99), a fish sandwich ($2.49) served with homemade tartar sauce. And lots more. I don't know how Dennis and Steve manage to turn out food of this quality for so little money, but I surely do hope they continue and prosper!",

Everything you have ever wanted in a soda pop selection. Everything from real sugar Pepsi to saranac Shirley temple. I decided to have the biggest burger I could and what a choice. I decided the newyork burger was what I craved. Burger on a fresh bun with tons of thin sliced cole slaw and amazing pastrami. The hot dog was the best my wife Ashley has had. Top it all off with chili cheese fries. No bean chili the way I like it. Fresh cut fries and it was cheesy heaven. The best part, 2 full people, 2 great sodas.....$12. Love it.",

    "text": "Beverage mecca.   Rocket Burgers is a new addition to the NW side of Phoenix. It is tucked away behind Church's Chicken on the SW corner of 35th Ave and Cactus. I would have never seen it had it not been for Yelp. I'm not sure what was there before it but it is set up like a 7-11. It's nothing fancy but clean. It is decorated in red, white, and blue and has a painting of a rocket shooting over the desert on the far wall. A tribute to the Moon Valley Rockets down the street. There are a few booths and some tables and chairs. There is a convenient store size glass cooler on the largest wall. Inside contains just about any kind of drink you can think of. I'm talking every Gatorade invented and several sizes, bottle waters of every variety, Yoohoo, V8, Jarritos, Jolt, Coke products, Pepsi products, craft brewed root beers of about 20 different varieties, craft brewed ginger ales, crush in every flavor, any kind of juice you can think of, the list goes on. I'm not a big soda drinker and I wanted to try them all. I must have looked at all of them for about 10 minutes before making my decision.   I ordered a chili cheese dog and onion rings. My wife ordered a single cheeseburger with fries. The guys/owners behind the counter are very cool. Anyone who wears a Fitz t-shirt deserves a shot at my business. My wife mentioned I had heard about them on Yelp and the gentleman was very happy to hear it. He smiled and said he had never heard of Yelp until recently and he has got a lot of business from it and its really working out well for them.   So I settled on a Maine Root Beer that was gluten free and caffeine free and delicious. After about 5 minutes or so our order comes out. My wife's burger was very good. It had a huge round top bun and some very fresh veggies on it. The fries were homemade, thin and very fresh. The burger tasted great. It reminded me of Lenny's but with fresher toppings and a much higher quality bun. The chili dog had what appeared to be homemade chili on it. They put cheese slices and mustard on the bun first and then the National Hebrew huge dog and smothered it with chili then put more mustard and onions on the top. Just like I make it at home and it was very tasty. The bun was sesame seeded and toasted. The onion rings were battered lightly with corn meal. They were good and different. I'm really not a big fan of onion rings so I wasn't in love with them but that's not saying they weren't good. The amount of food was very generous. It was hard to finish it and I ended up giving up rather than over filling myself.   I really enjoyed the beverage options these guys are serving up. The food wasn't out of this world but they did go the extra mile in everything they served. I appreciated that very much.  Another value was our huge meals with cool drinks came out to 12 bucks before a tip.  Plus they seem like they are a couple of great guys who started a business and who doesn't like to support that? We will definitely be going back to try out the subs and some other gourmet sodas.",

I loved the lemon/lime ones that they used to sell at the local corner store. That prompted me to Google to see if anyone sold them now and in Phoenix. To my surprise Rocket Burger popped up! We decided to check them out as they also have over 300 sodas for sale some that are hard to find. I let out a child like squeal when we walked it. There it was, glowing like an angel!! SLUSH PUPPIES!!!!! I purchased the biggest size they had and it was as good as I remember as a child. The owner, Steve was very nice and we chatted him and his counter guys up for a bit. We took a look at their menu. WOW is all I can say. So many options. We went for the Double Bacon Cheese burger, fried mushrooms (with cornmeal). Absolutely delicious. The burger was tasty, flavorful and the bun toasted to perfection. The mushrooms were divine! Best outside of Bun Huggers up in Flagstaff. I would highly recommend this place. If you love vintage soda pop, a great burger and Slush Puppies check them out. We ended up ordering them for takeout last Friday night. My bf had the gyro burger and we ordered the french fries. I had the BCB again. Once again a great meal!! Will be returning over, and over again..",

The soda selection is awesome and unique.  We got two Faygo's w/ lunch and got two different sodas to try later.  Shoestring fries were very good and hot.  Roast beef sandwich very good as was California Club.  Chicken strips were very good and were real meat; not like the pressed chicken you get at other places.  We plan to come back often and try more menu items and stock up on Faygo.  The owners are also friendly and personable which gives this place an old school, neighborhood establishment kind of vibe.  I think it is important to keep our entrepreneurial spirit alive and love to support local businesses; especially when they show the kind of quality, attention to detail and personality that Rocket Burger and Subs displayed on our visit.",

The place is located in a strip mall and actually kinda cool.  It's got a huge selection of pop along the wall, and has a great menu of items to choose from.  Prices are fair, and over all, it was a great experience.  I went with the Gyro burger with a pop, and it was out to my table in no time. Hot and tasty, and it hit the spot.  The burger itself was actually quite big, and stacked real high.  Pretty cool!  There's a reasonable amount of seating, with booths and tables like.    One thing I noticed is that they only have one unisex bathroom. I guess I'm used to a Men's and a woman's, but that's okay.  The parking lot was also overrun with teenagers for some reason, so I'm not sure what that's about.  There must be a high school near by, but they were just all hanging around, and some of them were in the restaurant as well. I guess it must be a fun place for them to hang out at!  Either way, if your on this side of town, and want something different and cool, go check this place out.  They seem to have something on the menu for everyone.",

Interstellar is one of my favorite movies of all time and I wanted to feel like Matthew McConaughey blasting off into space as I ate. Unfortunately, my burger made me feel more like Anne Hathaway, which is weird because I've never been in love with Captain Edmunds, although I do agree that his planet shows the most promise. Still it was a pretty decent burger.  The atmosphere makes me feel like I'd traveled back in time about 50 years. This is, of course, possible with the help of some 4th dimensional beings, AKA ourselves in the future. If I could travel back in time to the day I ate at Rocket Burger, I would order another burger.",

Too bad I don't drink soda.  The girl at the counter was very pleasant though.

I have sampled an array of the offerings and I proclaim them all to be of better than decent quality, some are in fact astoundingly crafted to be in a high range of quality. My primary example of this is the New York Burger, which is a layer of pastrami a layer of cole slaw and a slice of really delicious cheese on the already amazing all-beef burger. The bread is also noticeably awesome here, the sub rolls are soft yet sturdy for stacking meats onto and the burger buns are to die for. If I let this review go by without mentioning the fried zucchini it would be a crime against having good taste in the realm of food. The zuke is breaded and tastes very fresh, it is expertly packaged so as to not get mushy and the presentation is very appetizing to the eyes.  I need at least one of these burgers a month in order so that I do not devolve into madness.  I work in food prep and I can say that I recognize all the details they put into their food at Rocket Burger. I will leave the surprising selection of soda and bottled beverages for you to experience on your own as it adds to the charm of the establishment.  A high five to the crew and owners for getting it right.",

    "text": "First time visit, found using Yelp.  Decor is a little funky with colorful rockets painted on the walls.  First thing you notice is a set of large coolers with every brand of soft drink bottles and cans.  I had no idea there were so many different varieties and brands on the market.  Staff was very friendly and offered several suggestion as they have a large number of burgers with all sorts of choices available as single  and multiple patties.  My wife selected the California Burger with Avacado, Bacon, Swiss Cheese, Lettuce, Tomato and Onion Rings.  They offer their \"Rocket Sauce\" which is based on a variant of Thousand Island.  She had an order of Onion Rings.  I had a Teriyaki Burger which came with Cheese, Pineapple, Lettuce, Tomato, Mayo and a homemade  Teriyaki Sauce.  I had French Fries.  The Burgers were fabulous!  They have a special Bun, a giant step up from the more conventional mass produced bun.  The beef was not overcooked and was delicious. The bun was more dome shaped than flat and a challenge to open wide enough to get the burger in your mouth gracefully.  Generous slice of Pineapple and Tomato.  The Onion rings were some of the best we have ever had.  The coating was thinner than what you normally get but fabulous in taste.  The portion was very generous and came with a couple small containers of Ranch Dressing.  Unfortunately the French Fries were a disappointment.  Generous portion but rather small cut, texture was overly soft and color dark brown indicating a non premium type of potato.  Too little starch and to much sugar causing the overly dark color and somewhat oily taste.  Would have rated the meal as five stars but poor fries dropped them a full star.  Will definitely return and perhaps talk to the staff about selecting a better potato or more optimum cooking method.",

One of my friends from Ohio always talks about Faygo soda and when I saw that in one of the pictures for Rocket Burger I knew I had to go for that and then after seeing all the great reviews I was excited about the food too.  Had a little trouble trying to find it at first so for everyone trying to find it for the first time, it's on the South West corner of Cactus and 35th Ave.  You probably won't see it from the street but there's a Church's Chicken right in front of it so just pull into that parking lot and Rocket Burger is right behind it.  I got the Single Bacon Cheeseburger with fries and a Faygo soda (of course!).  The guy at the counter was nice and polite but not overly friendly.  The food came out very quickly, probably under 5 minutes and it was nice and hot.  The burger was good, they really stack it with the toppings too and you can tell they're quality.  No soggy veggies and limp bacon here.  I loved the fries too!  They're shoestring and they're coated with some kind of seasoning salt that gives them a great flavor.  So glad that my quest for soda helped me discover a great burger place too!",

I have been  going to Rocket Burger for a couple of years now and on a regular basis... maybe 2-3 times per month. I have NEVER been disappointed.   I get the Cali Burger which has bacon (which is always crispy) and avocado (which is always perfectly ripe).  It also has rocket sauce  on it which is like no other \"secret\" sauce I have had before. You just have to try it.  The amazing bun that the hamburger comes with is more like a crusty roll type bread rather than the standard seeded bun.   The fries are good, but overshadowed by how amazing their burgers are.   The soda selection is like nothing I have ever seen before. Hundreds of choices. Bottled sodas from across the nation and soda I have not seen in years!   Oh and the service - they are great! They actually thank you for coming in and say by when you leave. They know who I am (as they should since I go there so often), but they really give it a personal touch!   This is my#1 burger joint - hands down! So glad I work so close to this place!  You would be a fool not to give this place a try!",

A legitimate \"spicy\" chicken sandwich.    2) New York Burger- my wife decided to go for an extra meaty option, and she loved it. It comes with a burger patty, pastrami, and her husbands bacon from the chicken sandwich. Also cole slaw. She also said the fries were well seasoned.   3) SO MANY SODAS- I'm not a huge soda drinker, but the sheer volume and variety is pretty amazing.

    "text": "Nothing Fancy but Oh So Good.  You couldn't tell by looking at the outside.  However, as the old adage goes \" You can't judge a book by its cover.\"  The same can be said about Rocket Burgers and Subs. Nothing fancy here but the food is oh so good.  The food at Rocket Burgers and Subs   doesn't cost much more than the average fast food establishments around town.  However, you would be challenged to find a burger that compares to the quality and taste of the food  served at Rocket Burgers and Subs.  Rocket Burgers and Subs serves up various styles of burgers, beef hot dogs, sandwiches, and of course subs.  On this visit I went with the Lunch Special ($4.99).  The lunch special consisted of a burger, fresh cut fries, and a soft drink.  The lunch special was a great price and the food was delicious.  The hamburger roll was perfectly grilled, hamburger  grilled to medium, and the fries which were made from fresh cut potatoes with skins  were seasoned perfectly and so tasty.  In addition to great food, Rocket Burgers has the largest selection of bottled sodas I have ever seen. Every soda combination you can imagine and even those you can't is served at Rocket Burger.  The  dining is casual. You order at the counter and seat yourself. The prices are more then reasonable, staff is friendly, portion sizes are large, and the food is delicious.  What more could you ask for.",

    "text": "Firstly...really friendly staff.  The guy at the counter was patient and helpful.  We ordered easily, and the food came out quickly.  Secondly...both our burgers (I got a regular hamburger and hubby got the Santa Fe burger) were drenched in their \"Rocket Sauce\".  My burger was literally falling apart, and I couldn't even taste if I had a patty in there, or not.  It was dripping so much in my basket, I wouldn't have been able to put it down, to taste anything else.  The sauce has a very pickley flavor to it, which neither of us are fans of--we always ask for no pickles on any sandwich.  Hubby couldn't taste his green chile, which is the main reason he got that burger.  Thirdly...I got the fries as a side, and they were the best part of our meal.  Hubby ended up sharing them with me, which I didn't mind, since they do give you a lot.  They're thinly cut and somewhat crispy, but they were all gone at the end of our meal.  As a side, hubby got the fried zucchini.  They were okay, and you could tell they were made there and not frozen.  The only problem was, they were cut way too thick, and the breading was falling off.  We didn't even finish them.  Lastly...the walls of sodas was really impressive.  Hubby got an orange soda by Faygo (we'd seen someone mention it on \"Check Please, Arizona!\").  He downed it quickly.  I'm not a soda-drinker, so I got a bottled water...sorry, not too exciting.  But, it was fun to look at the different brands they had.  Chances are, we won't be going back...we were a little disappointed.",

    "text": "Looking for a great burger joint with never ending variety of sodas?  Then you found your place.  Rocket Burger is another one of those diamonds in the rough.  A classic no frills burger place with plenty of flavor and a vast selection of sodas to wash it down.        For my visit I had the Eddie Lopez burger which is your standard burger topped with pastrami and some of their rocket sauce.  The pastrami was excellent with just the right amount of caramelizing and not too crazy with the sauce.  The burger was well seasoned and bursting with juicy flavor.  You gotta love when a place seasons their burgers correctly.  The included fries were also seasoned quite heavy, but I feel this is a classic burger place style, especially when you're piling them down with plenty of ketchup.        You can't have a proper greasy spoon burger with out a good soda to wash it down.  Luckily Rocket Burger offers over 1,000 sodas, juices, and teas.  They have everything from obscure energy drinks to classic Mexican Cokes, it would take years to taste every soda in this place.  Even if you're not a burger fan you can easily find something you like in the cooler.      Overall Rocket Burger was fantastic, and I will be going back to enjoy another delicious meal.",

I didn't try the burgers but the fish sandwich I ordered was great.  It was dressed with a pico de gallo slaw.  You won't go away hungry with this dish or any dish probably.  And, they have a throw back to classic sodas...that was cool.  It appears that they own/operate the Pop shop next door too; which houses even more soda...nice overall throw back feel.  The place has about 8-10 tables, so it can easily seat about 40 people.  I believe it's a family run place and they are all friendly.  I can parking will be an issue if the have a full house, just plan to going during less busy times and/or order to go. I will definitely be back whether dine in or take out... ;p",

The best part is the drink selection you have. You can get a bottle drink with ur meal which makes it an enjoyable experience. Overall good place not sure if we would come back for the burgers but for sure for some drinks",

Rocket Burger offers an above average burger, including some unique creations that might be somewhat intimidating to try at first.    Everything I've tried has been good, but not quite as alarmingly great as some people describe. Additionally, both their regular seasoned and cheese fries are also worth trying when paying a visit.  The cool thing about Rocket Burger is their massive variety of sodas! They carry many of my favorite brands, including Boylan and Jones, as well as many obscure flavors that you probably won't find anywhere else in Phoenix.  Very cool place that I recommend trying!",

I had one of the specials on the chalk board and I have to say it was one of the best burgers I have had in a while, pepper jack cheese and spicy mayo just made my mouth the happiest it's been for a while. There is plenty to look at while waiting for your burger to be served to you at your table.

The side items are just as good, you must try the cheese curds. The beverage choice are endless with there soda wall, you name they probably have it. I always get one to go, as i am addicted to the snozzberry in the fountain drink selection. It's a little out of my way, but worth the drive.",

I've never had a bad burger here. The chili cheese fries are pretty great. The fish sandwich is good but messy to eat by hand.  I don't drink soda, but if I did this place would be like heaven: a monterous  selection of carbonated beverages lines the back wall.",

The burgers were excellent, but of course if you want to visit the first and last word on soda pop variety, this is it. Cases from wall to wall greet your eye. For any given flavor, you will see maybe twenty or thirty different varieties from all over this great land of ours. The staff was very friendly and helpful, and the service overall was excellent as well. Steve, busy as he was, came out personally to act as soda sommelier, guiding me to some of his favorites. The blueberry soda from Maine was amazing, as was Gales Root beer and a cream soda called something like Sprechers form Wisconsin where the honey used came through nicely. The Manhattan Orange was good as well, although not quite in the same league. With lunch, my wife had a Boyland's grape which, like almost all Boyland sodas, is first rate. Highly recommended for food, drink, and just the overall experience. We heard about this place on Check Please and are so glad we did. Next time I will try the kosher dogs which look tempting..and maybe pick up a few special bottles...",

The burgers are great, but the other thing that made the place pop for me was the selection of artisan sodas. The place has a giant selection of sodas that are so rare to find. I'm from Maine and they had Moxie. I can't get Moxie soda anywhere here in the valley, that is except at Rocket Burger! This review isn't for the soda Moxie, it is definitely an acquired taste. Rocket Burger on the other hand is not a place that has to grow on you. You'll fall in love with it right away.",

And was shocked how the neighborhood had changed so much in 30 years! Rocket Burger is tucked behind Church's Chicken. It did not disappoint! I have been there twice now. I have tried the rueben sandwhich, California club, California burger, the NYer fries and onion rings. All of it was great and affordable. The subs are packed with meat and the sandwiches are big enough for two people to split. My least favorite was the burger. But for subs I would go back. The onion rings were crunchy, with a light coat of batter, and thinner which I like. The fries were just ok. But then, fries are not my thing. My kids liked that they could pick out any type of soda. I picked one that tasted like a mojito. My daughter had a pear soda, and my youngest had a delicious rootbeer that had butterscotch in it. The coleslaw on the NYer was great! It was fresh and crunchy! In fact all the vegetables were fresh! Even the avocado, it wasnt just a little bit that came on the burger, but it was enough to cover the entire bottom bun. The tomato was wasnt chintzy either, Yay! Great family business that I would support any day over the big guys. This place rocks. And all of us can find something to eat here. Score!",

And if all of that is not enough to make you want to go these guys stock an insane amount of rare sodas that you will not find just any where. I think they had about 12 kinds of root beer!

The beef is never frozen, fresh angus beef. Cheeseburger is made with American cheese. I would have preferred cheddar which wasn't an option. Hubby got the Philly burger- an amazing burger to see piled high with meat and all the cheese steak fixings. I've read poor reviews about the fries- don't pass them up! Fries were perfectly cooked- crispy but not burnt with some softness in the middle. Seasoned to perfection. The owner took our order, he was very friendly and helpful. We bought 6 sodas (drank 1 each, took the rest home) out of amazement. The selection is like nothing I've ever seen. I think this place should be featured on a show like diners, drive ins and dives. The wall of sodas bottles for sale is enough to make a trip for, and the burgers are very tasty.  The sodas come from from every state, maker, flavor, etc you could ever imagine. Lots of nostalgic flavors and memories await you here. This would be a really fun place to go for fathers day or a birthday- a man cave for sure. Parking isn't great- its a hole in a wall place in a strip mall. Nothing fancy- just tasty, laid back. The perfect dive and tons of fun!!",

    "text": "We were in Phoenix for one day while on a big road trip. Being from out of town, we got lost trying to get there, but it was totally worth it.   The soda selection alone was worth the trip, but the sandwiches were really top-notch too. The fries were thin-cut and really tasted like potato. They were fried fairly dark, and some of them were limp by the time we got them back to the hotel, but I've never had fries that stayed crispy after being transported in Styrofoam, so it's hard to say what they would have been like fresh from the fryer. I thought they were delicious.    The Teriyaki burger featured Teriyaki sauce that was flavorful (not super salty) and, most importantly, DEEP FRIED PINEAPPLE RINGS. I ordered the Italian sub and sort of regretted not getting something more unique, but the sandwich was probably the best I've had since moving away from the Philadelphia area. The lunchmeat seemed high quality and the bread tasted fresh.  We ate at a lot of great places during our road trip and this was definitely a highlight.",

It isn't a place that's high end where their cows get back massages and pedicures before getting slaughtered and cooked in some fancy french culinary term, it's better. Just when I thought their burgers were the best, I tried my wife's teriyaki chicken sandwhich after I swallowed my burger and it was heavenly. We don't drink soda either but we always split one, vanilla cream is the best. I would eat here all day everyday, unfortunately my pants are already getting tighter lol. It's a solid 10.

My friend ordered the Cali Burger and loved it.  I ordered the Afterburner Chicken sandwich and loved it, except the bun fell appart and was a little big for the sandwich.  The fries were really good, but the onion rings were exceptional.  I am very picky about onion rings and usually stay from them.  These only have a thin batter coating, and it's very flavorful.    I'll go back to try several of the other menu items, and the onion rings again!",

Rocket Burger has an impressive menu with varying tastes where anyone can find something that suits them. I tried the New York and the Garlic burger. Wow. Those were extremely different and delicious! Made fresh to order and quicker than I thought it should take. The only drawback? It's in Phoenix and I live in Mesa... My poor gas tank.

Still. obviously you can get a double, but actually the smaller weight almost guarantees that they make the burger well done. The bun was nice and squishy and fresh toppings were included along with the secret thousand island sauce which turned out to add a good flavor to the food. Of course, the highlight is the soda factory and if you get the combo, make sure to add 2 more bucks to have it include one of the beverages in the case. I ended up going radical with the pumpkin pie soda and yes it did taste like a lighter version of the pie and it was all natural as well. Fries were pretty addicting too.",

The hot dog buns were very hard, both me and my brother got a couple bits into our burgers and were almost completely turned off and couldn't eat another bit. The hot dogs were barely enjoyable as well... maybe the burger was so bad it made everything taste bad. Mushrooms were ok. We did take our food togo, but I wouldn't expect it to ruin the food this much. Very disappointed",

    "text": "Was searching for a place to eat before a Halloween party. Saw rocket burger on the map and had heard someone mention them a week earlier. Ordered the \"Eddie Lopez\" double burger, had pastrami on top. Best damn burger.....not better than mine....but close :-D Fries suck but i just wont order them again. Service was good and the owner is there every time i go and is very friendly. Which is probably the reason for 5 stars, i don't hand them out like candy.... (Edit: Changed to 4 star, gotta keep the 5 stars exclusive) They have over 200 different sodas in the fridge which is pretty unique.  Ive been back 3 times and will keep going back.",

    "text": "My head was spinning from the gourmet soda selection. It sort of overshadowed the food in this, my first trip. I had the Chicago style burger...the accoutrements were perfect, down to the last pickled relish drop. My only complaint is that the bun was sub-par...a nice, soft sesame seed bun would have made the burger more memorable. Burger to bun ratio was a little bit off. I will definitely return, and suggest you do the same!",

    "text": "5 for sure. I love this place. Found on Yelp. We are from Cleveland, Ohio & it's hard to find anything in Phoenix to fit our taste buds. Fortunately for us, we stumbled upon this place and decided to try it out. First off, I give them a 5 for customer service. They were so nice, helpful and accommodated to our every need. I am beyond picky. I ordered a gyro burger & I have to say it was one of the better gyro I've had. I also  ordered a plain hot dog but I  had to customize it with a few things just like I would back home (fries, bbq sauce & coleslaw) aka polish boy. And I'd have to say it was one of the best we've had. The coleslaw was perfect, bbq sauce was great & the fries, yummm. The only complaint I have is that I couldn't get a picture fast enough before we devoured our food.  We will definitely without a doubt be coming back.  Thank you so much Rocket burger for fulfilling our cravings.",
