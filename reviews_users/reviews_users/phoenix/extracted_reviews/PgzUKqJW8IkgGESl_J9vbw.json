I stopped into Noci Cafe for the first time, glad to see someone in Galileo's old space.  Both the server and a gentleman who I believe to be the owner worked harder than I have ever seen to make sure they were giving excellent customer service.  They both were so nice to me and all the customers, gladly and pleasantly answered all questions and did everything they could to try to meet the Customers' needs before we even knew we needed it.  I ordered at the counter and the server even came around the counter to take my very small order to my table, after asking me what table I want.  They way exceeded my expectations, which I realized have been set by too much time in Starbucks lately.  The coffee was very good and prices aren't bad, especially for the area.  Unfortunately, the croissants weren't very good.  They weren't flaky, were too soft, didn't have a crispy outside.  Not nearly as good as the perfect croissants Galileo used to make, and I was disappointed because we don't have any good bakeries around here and I was hoping we had one again.  If it were just for the pastries this would be a 2 Star review. However, it could just be learning curve and I hope the pastries will improve in time.  The people at Noci Cafe made my day, and I encourage you to stop by for the excellent customer service!",

The service is by far some of the best I've had in the valley: prompt, welcoming, the ladies working are extremely kind and seem to really love what they're doing.  The decor is incredibly cute and makes me want to turn my kitchen into a cozy cafe of my own! Lots of creativity and care obviously went into the design.  I ordered the 2 eggs sunny side up with ham, which also came with hash browns (or home fires but I'm a sucker for hash browns). The eggs were perfectly cooked and the portions of ham and hash browns were definitely not skimpy.  My SO ordered a veggie omelette with sausage which came out looking beautiful. All of the fillings were mixed in with the eggs and folded in a classic French omelette style.  The hash browns were unique as some other yelpers have mentioned, they are very shoe string like and each is crispy instead of leaving the center unfried, but they were still delicious.",

They are open 7am to 3PM and close at 2PM on Sunday. The food is delicious. They serve breakfast all day. The omelets come with hash browns or roasted potato and homemade bread and spectacular homemade jam. YUM!!! The  soup are homemade, try the meatball soup..the best. The chicken salad sandwich is on their homemade crusty bread. All the lads are generous and wonderful. The omelet with potato and toast is only $10. The coffee are well worth the trip. This is the best place hands down in the area. If they were open for dinner, I would never have to cook again. Kudos to the owners. Thank-You for your hard work.",

The waffle came out a beautiful golden brown and include a large helping of fresh fruit. But don't be alarmed it was the nasty stuff like cheap melon. It was fresh berries. The panini came with a massive helping of hearty fries. A perfect blend of euro meets american.   The best part of all was the coffee. We had iced coffee and the ice it was served over rivals sonics iconic ice!  The coffee was brewed to absolute perfection. Bold and flavorful.   The staff was so sweet.

I ordered an iced latte and huevos rancheros with hash browns. The latte was almost undrinkable - it tasted like cold drop coffee mixed with milk.  The highlight was the huevos rancheros which were actually pretty good - hence two stars in this review. However, I asked for hash browns as a side and what I received were thinly cut french fries that were subpar at best. I asked about a possible mistake on getting fries and the server mentioned that these french fries were, indeed, their \"hash browns\"...  I think the people running this place should probably check out google images on what exactly hash browns are or change their side choices from large French fries (the other option) to \"small French fries\".  Overall, a disappointment - especially when Butters, Altitude Coffee, and Village coffee are literally right down the street.",

We Yelped the area and found Noci's incredible reviews, so we could not pass it up! Of course, after seeing their delicious pastries and baked goods, we couldn't pass those up either (I wasn't even hungry and was going to lunch in an hour)! Yes, fatty status. Anywho, this family-owned local eatery is definitely worth stopping in. Their service is incredible and the coffee/pastries that we ordered were delightful! I will definitely be back the next time we make a stop at the vet! I will make sure to be hungry and not have lunch plans soon after so that I can try more items off of their menu! Their breakfast looks delish.",

The menu is insanely reasonably priced up and down, and they have a rotating list of specials on the board.   I ordered the Spicy Italian panini (one of the specials) and it was utterly loaded with meat, with delicious bread and crisp fries. Full of flavour and perfectly balanced with cheese and sauces, i  was STUFFED for $9. My girlfriend got a scrambled egg sandwich that was on special and she was jaw dropped. Blown away! The bacon was the tastiest she's ever tried.  All in all, really great meal. Recommend to anyone, won't disappoint.",

I would recommend them in a hard beat, good food, fresh, healthy and a wonderful service! Thank you Noci Cafe.",

I decided to sit at a table inside and have a full breakfast.  The place was pretty busy.  Definitely quite a few old guys who are regulars sitting around drinking coffee and BSing with each other which is cool.  The owners and staff really hustle and provide good service.  I had the sausage and cheese omelet with hash browns.  The omelet itself was pretty basic but good sized.  The hash browns were a little dry and crispy more like matchstick potatoes and I wasn't wild about them.  Overall I'd say this is a pretty good place for breakfast if you're in the area.",

It almost takes you back in time with the owners and their daughter serving and cleaning tables in a modest but clean space, the fresh baked goods in display cases, the fresh specialty coffees, and the chatter of the \"usuals\" that I imagine frequent weekly if not daily. I, selfishly, don't want this little secret place to get out but I also think they deserve the recognition and success.",

First thing we were offered was coffee and I had the cappuccino.  I hadn't  had a cappuccino in ages but this one was terrific.  Menu had lots of options for breakfast, we choose the strawberry waffles and bacon my husband got eggs too!  Everything was wonderful including the fresh fruit on the waffles, home fries, and the home made sourdough toast!  The owner waited on us and his wife came out from the kitchen to check on us and bring more coffee.   They had us try some homemade mixed fruit jelly which was great!  For us the food was outstanding but the service was like being in your best friends kitchen!  Most customers were called by their name and asked about there recents events etc.  We have to come to the valley monthly and will make a point to be here monthly!  Yeah we finally found a great place!  These folks are doing it right!    PS the reviews about service being poor couldn't have been here!",

The home made pastries were about gone so we did not buy or try any of them. However, we did purchase a loaf of Baguette bread to take home and it was also okay.

I am a snob when it comes to coffee, and I can guarantee their cappuccinos are the very best. Second for me is the French toast. They serve it as you like it--for me that's with fruit and a sprinkling of powered sugar. All in all, your best bet is to forgo the big chains with the prefab food and step into a welcoming place that serves fresh food with a personal touch.

    "text": "Noci has a coupon in the entertainment book.  We arrived about noon and it was pretty empty.  It is a very small place only seats about 20 people inside.  We ordered some eggs and toast.  I had the salad with fresh berries, mango, spinach it was very good.  The jelly came out with the toast, so we ordered some muffins so we could all try the homemade jelly.  This is where it got weird.  I ask the owners if all the muffins were home made and both her and her husband said yes, her husband said he made all the muffins from scratch himself...My friend who works at Costco was with me and we both looked at the Poppy and Chocolate muffins which so happen to look identical to the muffins at Costco.  I say this because I can not eat the muffins at Costco because of some of the ingredients.  But for a restaurant to pass off store bought muffins as their own, is pretty dishonest and can be harmful especially if you do not know the ingredients.....The muffins which looked homemade raisin bran and pistachio tasted great and we all finished the jelly.  I had to only give them 3 stars because of the misinformation with the muffins..  The food and the prices were great and we might try this place again and try the sandwiches but will stay away from the poppy and chocolate muffins.",

While the menu is not extensive, the selections available were absolutely wonderful. We had the waffles with fresh fruit, several egg dishes, great OJ and the fresh oatmeal. All items were cooked to perfection and very reasonably priced.   Both the owner and his wife made sure everything we needed or wanted was brought to our table. This is definitely a family run business and even their young daughter had a hand in suggesting her favorites. Space is limited, but the restaurant is clean and welcoming. A very nice change from the chain options.",

Took me a month before I had a chance to visit here for breakfast but I am so glad I finally did.  When I came with my friend on chilly Sunday morning, we took the last table available. Although they have nice tables outside too but it was too cold to sit outside on that particular morning. Within a few minutes, a nice couple walked in and they were told 10 mins wait. Since we took a table big enough for four, I suggested to them to share a table with us. It turned out they were regulars here and eat breakfast almost everyday!  Per a regular customer recommendation, I ordered egg Benedict. Porched eggs and hollandaise sauce were prepared just right, no wonder why this regular customer calls this the best!  I got to taste a bit of their homemade jam. Right amount of sweetness and somehow they kept the fresh taste of fruit, I thought I could just eat this jam and toast only and be happy.  Cappuccino was excellent too. I enjoyed thick layers of milk foam as well as very good espresso.  In fact I thought it would be nice to come back here to use as a cafe to enjoy coffee and sweets someday.  They also serve lunch.  I would love to come back for lunch too. I have so much more nice things to say about them. It's a small family owned cafe/restaurant and they take pride in what they do. Can't wait to come back for more good food soon.",

    "text": "Finding a good place to eat lunch on a Sunday is always challenging but I found this cafe on Yelp rated 5star so it caught my interest. This is the only business open on a Sunday in this shopping center so it was pretty easy to find the cafe.   Walking in I was a little confused cause no one really said anything so we just found a table and hoped for the best. It's a small little cafe with a good ten table inside and a few table outside. Very modern looking with a mirror wall next to the tables. Interesting. All their specials are on the huge chalkboard.   The waitress came pretty quickly with the menu and took our drink orders. I started off with an iced latte. Which was really good. I ordered the three egg omelette with sausage and cheese with potatoes and sour dough toast. I wasn't expecting too much cause it's just an omelette but man was that good. Loved the sausage. Very flavorful and really enjoyed it. First time I could really say I was impressed with an omelette. It came with some shoestring potatoes which were really crisp and flavorful. They were pretty good but the toast. Really Doug. The toast. It came with their homemade jelly. Cherry jelly. Do I have to say anymore. I love cherry. It was so good. Chunks of cherries. It was so good. I finished the toast but just ate the rest of the jelly plain. It was that good.   My wife ordered spaghetti and meatballs. Wow. The meatballs were just the right size. Juicy. Tender. Really really good. My wife keep asking me to try the spaghetti but I declined but she kept on pushing it so I took a little Twirl and it was so good. I loved the marinara sauce. Never had a sauce like this. It was so good. My wife said that she could eat this every day. I would have to agree with her. It was outstanding. Her meal came with a side salad with Italian dressing. Really good dressing. Usually Italian always has a little too much vinegar for me but not this one. Perfect spices. Really enjoyed the salad.   So the service was outstanding. It took a little while for the kitchen to bring our food out but that's okay. This is a mom and pop shop and I love to support these places. The mom is the waitress. Dad is at the counter and their son (8th grade) is there to help clean tables and deliver food to the tables. Very cool family. Very friendly. Always kept tabs on us. Really enjoyed our meal. Outstanding.   At the end, we ordered a cherry turnover to go and I got home and couldn't stand it and had to eat it. As you know I love cherries. It was so flaky. So good. Then I got to the cherry filling. So my gosh. Better than the cherry jelly. Yum yum good. Gosh darn it was so good.   So what's not to like about this place. Good food. Good coffee. Good service. Mom and pop shop and such a warm and friendly atmosphere. I've got to come back again and try more of their food. I'm hooked. Loved it.",

    "text": "Some reviews are just pleasurable to write. Noci Cafe is a small family run restaurant/bakery/coffee shop that is simply exceptional. A perfect spot for brunch.  Noci is small. Perhaps eight tables indoors and a similar number outside. There can be a problem finding a table at peak times or if a large group shows up, but most hours it's not an issue, especially if you don't have a preference whether you sit indoors or out. The outdoor seating is shaded and on the north side of the building, making it quite comfortable most of the year or just requiring a sweater if it's the cool season.  The menu features breakfast and lunch items, served all day. Additional menu items are posted on a chalk board behind the counter. Noci is open from 7:00 a.m. - 3:00 p.m. weekdays and 7:00 a.m. - 2:00 p.m. on weekends. You may just stop in for a coffee or bakery item to go if you'd like. On this early afternoon visit, our party opted for breakfast, lunch and baked goods. And why not? All were exceptional. The panini? Great! The burger? Great? The breakfast platter? Great! The muffin? Great! You get the idea. If there is a weakness in the menu, we have yet to find it. One of our young ones didn't care for the fruit and granola yogurt concoction she ordered from the kids menu. The yogurt was too tart for her young taste buds. Our waitress/wife/co-owner noticed the predicament and suggested adding honey. Problem solved. Not a speck left in the bowl. Even lowly potatoes, hash browns and French fries, were amazing. When have you ever eaten hash browns as a finger food? We did today at Noci.  The family vibe of the establishment makes dining at Noci a True pleasure. Service is always friendly and accommodating. Midway through this meal our soon to be seven year old floated the idea of having her birthday party at Noci. Don't think we'll do that, out of respect to the owners and other diners, but we will definitely be back to enjoy Noci again and again.",

The family that runs Noci is incredibly sweet.   It is a small restaurant.  We've never waited for seats, but it's never been empty either. There have been \"regulars\" there each time we've been in, so clearly the community of McCormick Ranch loves Noci Cafe.    I love their Breakfast Sandwiches.  My wife loves their Eggs and their Fruit.   Everything tastes very fresh.  I'm getting hungry just thinking about going back to Noci, for breakfast or lunch.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Noci Cafe offers friendly service and good breakfasts for a reasonable price. It was pretty busy when I got here around 10:30 but the crowd eased up as I finished my meal. There is seating both inside and outside, and there is a counter with bar seating as well as a case of pastries for quickie to-go orders.  After browsing through the breakfast menu I went with the veggie cheese omelette with home fries and multigrain toast. It was made in record time and a very generous amount of food.   The omelette was super fluffy and soft, mixed in with a lot of chopped peppers, onions, and spinach. It could have used a touch more seasoning but overall I enjoyed it. The potatoes were soft and were too mealy tasting for me. Some more browning to crisp up the edges would help with the texture in general. The house-made jam served with the toast was actually my favorite part of the meal. It was lightly sweet and oh so fabulous. I scooped up as much as I could onto my toast. I could eat a vat of that stuff!  Service was super friendly and they really want to make sure you are having a good experience here.  I'll definitely be back to try more items off the menu if I'm in the area.",

They are a step up from traditional diner cooking of the same type of foods.  Breakfast - standard eggs, omelettes, pancakes along with several sandwiches and paninis and salads.  Add in really good baked goods and what more do you need?   Today I had the Chickpoltle Omelette filled with cheese, spinach, chicken and a Chipotle sauce drizzled over the top.  The hash browns are unusual but perfect for those who like their hash brows super crispy.  The fruit is always fresh and tasty. The salads are crisp and fresh. The paninis are cooked well and generally tasty.  The bread is homemade and perfect with the homemade jam.  Overall we have been happy with everything here, so what more can I ask for.",

Even better, she remembered the names of my mom and grandma who had come in for breakfast earlier in the week! For breakfast I got a jumbo mocha and the huevos rancheros. The mocha was perfect for a nice cold winter morning. Not only did it taste fantastic, but it was wonderfully crafted with plenty of whipped cream and chocolate syrup. The huevos were perfectly made. Personally, I'm a bit picky with my eggs and don't like the egg whites runny. George, the chef, made them exactly the way I like it. I'd recommend this place to anyone, especially someone who needs a good pick-me-up in the morning or someone who simply wants a reason to smile. Thank you Vicki! Thank you Noci!",

    "text": "I'm writing this review after being famished and too lazy to go get my own food, so I used DoorDash to order up breakfast to get the strength to make it through my day. I was a bit indecisive at first, however, you, my fellow Yelpers posted a sufficient amount of photos so I kinda went with what looked good...   I ended up ordering an omelet with veggies and turkey, with hashbrown (so many reviews raved about how awesome they were), and wheat toast, as well as an iced latte with Irish Cream flavor and an extra shot (yea, it's one of those days). Well the order arrived quicker than I expected, which I was stoked about! yay, food!   At first sight, everything looked phenomenal, so I dug in! The omelet was decent, nothing spectacular, but good (could've used some hot sauce though), and the hashbrown... meh. I felt like I was eating tiny shoelace French fries that were overcooked and way too crispy. I mean I like my hashbrowns a BIT crispy, but not each strand to be so crispy -- I wanted to taste the potatoes. I liked the seasoning on them, but I wasn't too much of a fan; won't be getting the hashbrown again... I'll go with the homestyle potatoes next time.   As far as the iced latte... **sigh** disappointed. Maybe I'm not used to their roast of coffee beans? (I may be too much of a coffee snob, lol), but it tastes burnt to me. I keep sipping on it hoping it's gonna get better, but sip after sip I'm disappointed. I can't even taste the Irish Cream flavor in it -- leaves one to wonder, did they forget to add it? Hmm... I hope not, 'cause in that case I just paid extra for nothing.   Overall, my experience wasn't horrendous and I'll definitely try Noci Cafe again. I feel like I didn't get the full experience, being how it was a DoorDash order. Next time I'll go into the restaurant like a normal person and eat there, rather than have it delivered. That way, if something isn't to my liking, hopefully it will get corrected (ie, my iced latte), and everyone will be happy!",

The restaurant was clean and modern. I ordered one scrambled egg and bacon with hash browns and wheat toast. The hash browns were seasoned and tasted good. I couldn't stop eating them - the problem was I having a hard time eating them with my fork since their like thin matchstick fries so I said f it and started eating with my hands. They gave me homemade jelly that was delicious! Hubby ordered the Beni's special and he ate it all!! I guess he liked the food too.

Ordered a omelet and breakfast croissant... Omg so good! The omelet had the perfect amount of toppings and THE HASH BROWNS were thin & crispy to perfection! The croissant was buttery and delicious. This place was owed by a married couple who cooked all the food fresh themselves and you can tell they LOVE FOOD! So good we had to grab a few things from the display to go, of which the apple Danish was my favorite. My cousin loved the homemade jelly so much with her meal, she got a jar to go. This place is worth the wait!! I just hope I can get a table again next time!",

It's tucked in a small strip mall and inside it's just delightfully friendly and comfortable.  I was immediately struck by what it wasn't' - it wasn't the Good Egg or First Watch.  While these are nice restaurants, Cafe Noci has a real family vibe about it.  It's run by Stefan and his kids and they have a great repertoire of recipes.  You won't be disappointed by the True down home cooking you'll get.  The service was friendly as well which made for a great breakfast experience.   Thanks Stefan, we look forward to our next visit!",

They bake their own breads and pastry there. The baguette that came with my wife's omelette was fantastic. Their \"jelly\" is homemade and is more like a compote or chutney.

Very friendly atmosphere the food is good but not amazing, the best thing we tried was the pistachio muffin. I didn't give it five stars because it was not what we expected and the portions are small.",

First off the FoH team was composed of a lovely smiling mom, super nice dad  handsome 13 year old brother and Emily,(who's about put me out of a job with her level of hospitality )age 10. All were Super genuine and friendly... & Good at running a restaurant. The basics: came into a packed house with 1 clean table open. Still got service and quickly! My lovely friend Taylor ordered a cappuccino and it was so good, perfect amount of foam ( I tried it, before it was ruined by a sugar Avalanche)... She ordered a fried egg, soft bacon and substituted her side of hash brown for a chocolate chip pancake but the order came out perfect and all hot. I had three wheat blueberry pancakes and a hearty bowl of blueberry strawberry banana oatmeal which was sooo good. The entire meal we were just in awe of the dynamics, you must see for yourself!  And the food was really impressive, even though we ordered simple breakfast items... Don't worry, I'll tell you more about Emily. She walked by us a few times smiling and interacting with other tables just as her older brother was.. And then suddenly came over to fill our recently empty water (ya she's good at her job!) and politely looked me in the eye and inquired if I would like more water... Then turned to my friend and asked the exact same thing but it was so genuine. I'd hire Emily tomorrow, but it turns out her and her brother have it pretty good, as they get to collect on the tips :) Good job! Great success!",

Food is always delicious.   we had asked for a piece of toast to enjoy the homemade jam.  The owner charged me $2.00 for 1 piece of dry toast. Not to mention they serve only one piece of toast with an omelette. I am not one to be nickel and dime... the charge for the toast and .50 for a shot of vanilla cost you a few customers.",

You can get the classic - eggs, bacon/ham, toast and the best hash browns ever - they are more like crispy shoestring fries.  The eggs Benedict is great.  The avocado toast is wonderful.  Noci has its own homemade jam and it's good.  I doubt you could get a bad meal here.  The service is very good.  The servers want to know you and learn your name.  They care a lot about your satisfaction.    The ambiance is nice - it's not noisy.  When weather permits, you can sit at one of the half dozen outdoor tables.

I'm thinking that since they have less than a dozen tables inside, and five outside, it would be hard to get seating on weekend AMs, especially for larger parties. Either way, you should check this place out!  PS: I forgot to mention that their prices were outstanding. I don't think I saw a single menu item over $12, and most were around $8.",

While the staff very friendly, they were lacking in efficiency. Taking away menus from one table, glancing at us waiting for menus, choosing to go back to the bar, prepare some beverages and only then bring us those said menus... not professional. I enjoyed my eggs Benedict, even though my husband pointed out that the sauce was prefabricated. The French Toast had a nice cinnamon flavor, however it had been not dipped in the egg/milk mix long enough. Golden brown on the outside, dry and tasteless on the inside. Maybe it was an \" off \" day, so we will try it out again in the future.",

I ordered a Florentine omelet with cheese, spinach & tomato sauce...but it was also inexplicably served with ham & avocado. I didn't mind because I love those things but I'm sure a vegetarian would have been none too pleased. I got the fruit instead of toast since they don't offer any gluten-free. The fruit was delicious & fresh, unlike a lot of fruit cups you'll find full of mushy, dying melon & grapes.  My daughter loved her avocado toast. This item is not on the plastic menus they hand out. We only knew to order it from seeing it on Yelp. There were a few other menu items we didn't notice until after we ordered - they're written on the chalkboard inside & we were seated outside.   From reading other reviews, it looks like there is a new owner. It seems they're still figuring out how to run a restaurant. I'd say I'll come back for the good food, but I probably won't unless I have lots of time to burn.",

She was very attentive and pleasant. We haven't had service like this for a long time! I had the veggi-licous omelet and husband had the Mediterranean omelet. Both omelets were cooked perfectly. Not heavy or greasy. The perfect egg/filling ratio. Coffee was good also. Plenty of refills. Homemade jelly was delicious. Nice touch since you definitely don't get it at most restaurants. Even though it's quite the drive for us, we will surely go back soon.",

    "text": "Stopped into this little cafe with my daughter in law! One of my yelp friends Sandy B checked in here awhile ago, It looked great, so I had booked marked it, and so happy I did!  I'm all about, quality food, and service! Noci has both! We started with an order of avocado toast, followed by a Florentine omelette, then we almost polished off our order of the Banana Nutella crepes! That's why we LOVE to dine together, we share everything and always get to try multiple items!  The toast was good! Loved the cherry tomatoes and egg! I would have loved it even more had it been a thicker slice of toast! However, the price point is awesome, so no complaints. The omelette tasted very homemade and fresh, especially with the added mushrooms, Delicious!The hash browns that accompanied our omelette looked like shoestring potatoes, but were very tasty! They also serve home style potatoes, they looked great too! Thick diced and golden brown. ( I'll try them next visit!) Finally our last entree, or breakfast dessert, was the crepe! AMAZING! Truly, the thin crepe held an enormous amount of Nutella, banana and apples!  A must in every breakfast meal must include really good, HOT coffee, with ample amounts of fresh cream, and, not the annoying little cups that you have to open, that taste gross and ruins a good cup of coffee! (First Watch, take note!)  Service was simply spectacular! Honestly, what a lovely lady that took care of all the guest! Always making sure to refill that amazing coffee, and greeting new guest, and saying thank you as they leave.  Definitely some regulars in there!  Sadly, I did not take a single picture. I was enjoying my date with my daughter, and took every moment in. Left the phone tucked away in my purse :-) Every item was picture worthy, and simply delicious! You'll just have to trust me!!",

The Danish was good (3/5), but I had probably the worst sundried tomato omelette I've ever had in my life - which was unfortunate considering I love them and I walked in starving.  Not sure what the deal was or if it was just an off day, we did come right before closing, so maybe they were more concerned with cleaning up and getting out of there instead of how good the food was, but let's just say if I'm starving I'll eat anything and I left a full plate of food and couldn't even bring myself to try anything else.  So please just read the other reviews before you order and make sure it's something good ... bc clearly they have really good stuff I just apparently didn't order any of it.",

The coffee wasn't strong enough so she made another with an extra shots! I ordered an egg sandwich with a side of their potatoes. The flavor was there but it was not cooked enough. Some potatoes were still firm. My spouse also ordered in an egg dish with hashbrowns or actually very thin crispy shoestring fries. He did not like that style of hashbrowns. He only got one sourdough toast which could've used an extra minute in the toaster. What was odd is that we had to ask for butter for the toast. Overall, we'll give it a try again...only because they had a showcase full of pastries that I need to try.",

Saturday morning around 10 am. Busy, but not prohibitively so. I had a special omelette, the name of which I cannot recall. It had mozzarella, mushrooms, and was topped with bacon, a cilantro sauce, and pickled jalepenos (optional, for the faint-of-heart, although I will say they were not overly spicy and were quite a worthy addition to the dish). The omelette came with hash browns, which at this place are actually like a cross between hash browns and shoestring fries, and are quite good. Finally, it came with toast. I had the sourdough, with a side of their homemade preserves that were......just....WOW. SO good. I rounded this culinary adventure off with a large cappuccino, which, in keeping with the rest of the meal, was fantastic. All in all a wonderful little hole-in-the-wall breakfast place that I would become a regular of, were I a resident of Arizona. Thanks for the great breakfast and great service, Noci! I will visit again when I'm in town, and I will tell my family that live here in town that they need to visit you. Thanks Yelp, for showing us the great businesses around us! :)",

The Florentine omelette is to die for. The meatball soup was outstanding, and if you find yourself in the cafe it would be a sin if you don't try the homemade fruit jelly (all the flavors) its unbelievable, so unique and delicious and you will most likely crave it every day!

And even twice a waitress with a water pitcher walked by our table and didn't acknowledge us at all. More stars had the customer service been better.",

    "text": "We eat here two or three times a month. Always with extended family. Why? Eating at Noci feels like family. Noci Cafe is the very definition of a small local restaurant that deserves, no, has earned, my support.   I was motivated to write this review after seeing two one star reviews pop up today. Seemed odd. Two first-time Noci Cafe diners eating at the restaurant apparently at the same time as me. Complaining Noci is not the same as Butters. Thank goodness it's not! Complaining that the hash browns (the best I've ever eaten) are like shoestring fries. Are you kidding? Stating service was \"not professional, but OK\". You were likely being served by one of the owners! \"The worst breakfast place we've ever been to\". Seriously? One hundred Yelp reviews averaging five stars (until these two showed up) must be all wrong. The only complaint we've ever had in the many times we've eaten here was a couple of dry pancakes. Makes you wonder about the motivation of these two reviewers.   Enough about the stupid reviews. Why eat at the Noci Cafe? I love the muffins. I love the omelettes. I love the hash browns. I love the fruit placed on the pancakes and waffles. I love the oatmeal. I love the kids menu. I love that there is no one hour wait like Butters. I especially love the service and the intimate family atmosphere.   Hoping this review pops Noci Cafe's Yelp average back to five and wishing the two negative reviewers many happy breakfasts at Butters.",

It is smaller than I anticipated and isn't really near anything, just in a random strip mall. But it's a good location! Was not crowded at all and I could tell a few people there were regulars there which was awesome. The people working there were welcoming. Had a good neighborhood coffee shop type feel. I decided on the veggie omelet without cheese and a side of the potatoes and rye toast. It also came with homemade jam! My boyfriend got an egg sandwich with bacon and cheese with hash browns on the side. My omelette was good, and there was the perfect amount of veggies in it! The toast was good, jam wasn't really my thing but I thought it was cool it was made there. I just don't like jam much in general. Potatoes were pretty good. My boyfriend pretty much inhaled his food and finished way before me which is rare! He loved the sandwich and hash browns. I actually tried his hash browns and liked them more than my potatoes surprisingly! Best part? It was super reasonable! Definitely one of the more affordable breakfasts him and I have had together! We were pleased and look forward to coming back to this cute place!",

Great coffee and the breakfast was fresh and yummy - especially the hash browns, which were finely shredded and crispy.   The only reason I'm rating 4 not 5 stars is because their pastries are a little more soft and doughy than I like. I prefer my croissants more buttery crisp on the outside and soft and buttery on the inside...you know, the kind that has a slight crunch when you bite in, but then almost melts in your mouth.   Love supporting small business so I'll definitely return! I was impressed with their service and breakfast so I'm interested in giving their muffins and lunch items a try too.",

I love the breakfast croissants and the hash browns are so airy and light ...the owner tells me he cuts them by hand into these strips! Labor intensive but wow what a unique texture.   Love this place, let's spread the word!",

    "text": "A quaint little restaurant with great service and great food. Highly Recommended!  I was in the area around lunch time and checked Yelp, hoping to find a nearby gem. Based on the stellar reviews, I gave Noci's a try and was not disappointed! I arrived just after noon on a Friday, and it wasn't at all crowded. Most of the other customers seemed to be regulars judging by the friendly conversations with the staff. If I lived nearby, I think I would become a regular at Noci, too!  Food: The menu is packed with interesting choices. Breakfast and lunch are both served all day. But be sure to check out the board up on the wall behind the counter for the specials. Between the menu and the specials, I had a hard time deciding what to order! I settled on one of the omelette specials: the Chic-potle, and it was a good choice. The omelette has chicken, spinach, sundries tomato, Monterey Jack cheese, and a mild chipotle sauce drizzled on top. Honestly, I could have gone for more \"kick\", the chipotle sauce tasted like subtly spiced mayo. But even so, it blended well with the other ingredients for a nice flavor. The omelette comes with a choice of hash browns or home fries, but I asked about low-carb options. I was offered a fruit cup (not exactly low-carb!) and it came with a good variety of fresh fruits. I also had sourdough bread with homemade jam. The sourdough was tasty, and the jam was mixed-berry, which had a good flavor and a chunky texture reminiscent of cranberry relish. All-in-all, I really liked the food.  Cost: My lunch with no drinks, including tax, was a very reasonable $10.80.  Service:  The owner and namesake, Ben Noci, and the staff were very friendly and attentive. Service was quick, and they checked back occasionally to make sure I was happy.  Atmosphere: Well, it's a fairly small shop in a strip mall, but once inside it has a nice feel to it. Noci's has comfortable chairs, attractive wooden tables, and a tile floor, which all combine for a subtle, classy look. Tables are also available outside, if the weather is agreeable.  Overall: Highly recommended! Based on this one visit, I will definitely return when I'm in the area. Noci's menu has so much to offer, I'm eager to try more things.",

I don't think I'll won't be going back but I like trying new restaurants that are out there to switch it up.",

I've tried all the local coffee places in a 10 mile radius (and of course the Starbucks chain) and this is bar-none the best. Robust but not burnt, a hint of tang but not sour, just the right amount of water for that perfect flavor balance. If you love great espresso you MUST support this local gem - definitely my go-to now! FYI: I got an iced double espresso (Americano) for $2.   They have a great selection of breakfast and lunch items - also reasonably priced - and delicious looking baked goodies too.",
