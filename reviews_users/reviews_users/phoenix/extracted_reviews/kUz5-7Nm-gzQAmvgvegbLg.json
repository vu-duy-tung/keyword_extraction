On a great note the sushi rolls are very creative and by far the coolest selection I've seen. Also, they are made well and taste great.     On a downside the restaurant is a little expensive, but I've never been able to come in during their happy hour. Also, the service is bad. I can never really get a straight answer about things on the menu and I never feel like the waitresses care about my being there and helping pay their salary.     Other than the spotty service and the high prices this place is fun and would be a good \"date night\" for many couples.",

She has ignored me every time I've been there...I kept hoping it would get better but it only got worse. You will sit there for at least 15 minutes before she will bother to come over. One time my fiance asked her for a beer as she walked by and she said \"just a minute\" extremely sarcastically to him. We have seriously sat there every time we have been there and watched her flirt with some guys at the bar while we just sat there needing service. Also, she's pretty vulgar too, several f bombs have been dropped. Do not bring your parents to the bar!! I can guarantee she has never been a bartender before. I am really hoping management gets a clue and cans her ASAP so we can not leave that place angry next time. I wish I could say I won't go back but the sush is so good that we may just avoid the bar area, plus it's literally down the road.",

We then looked over the huge sushi menu. They have pictures of every single roll they have, which makes it so much easier to order. All of the rolls I ordered were simply amazing! I had spicy tuna, might have been one of the best spicy tuna rolls I have ever had. Also had the Vegas roll...holy hell... Once again.. One of the best Vegas rolls I have ever had. The waitress comped one of my adult libations because she could tell I wasn't a fan of the drink and brought me a new one. Overall the service was amazing and so was the sushi. I hope people read this review and know this place is legit.",

Each and everytime I have been rather dissapointed with teh level of service which has been slow and blase at the best of times.  This time around I had to wait 20 miniutes at teh sushi bar (after my order) before teh chef showed up. By then I had lost interest in suchi and Saketini as a whole. I would understand if this place was crowded but there were only 2 other groups and that too none of them were at the bar.  Note to self: Never venture here again",

    "text": "The reason I am leaving 3 stars is because they are in major need of renovations both inside and out. Their outside appearance is not at all appealing. Heaven forbid you need to use the restroom, you'll have nightmares. I seriously hold it until I get home, which by the way is a 15 minute drive. Now to get to the good stuff, their food is amazing!!! I am not one for sushi but all my friends and family love everything they have ordered from here sushi wise. I always order their ramen and they gyoza!! Both are fantastic!!! My friends and my family continue coming here because their food is great and their prices are fair. The one thing I did notice on my most recent visit is that they do add automatic gratuity now, which by the way was not even mentioned to us as we paid, and if if wasn't for one of my friends actually paying attention to their bill the waitress would have received an extra 25% tip on top of the 18% automatically charged. That honestly really annoyed myself and my companions because we all almost left way more extra tip. I don't mind places automatically including the gratuity, however we should be told so that we are aware of how much additional tip is needed so we don't over pay. Because of this I only left enough extra to get them to 20%. Some in my party who would have definitely tipped more than 18% left just the 18% since they felt wronged about not being told. It was very sneaky, not at all professional. Oh I should mention we were a party of 5 so not large and in small fine print on their menu it does state everybody will be charged automatic gratuity so doesn't matter how big or small your party is. I have been to other places that do this but I have always been made aware at the very beginning of the meal about their practices. Overall the appearance might scare you away but their food is truly great. I will continue to dine here as long as their quality of food meets my standards.",

    "text": "Nothing sticks out about Saketini that makes it great, so I'm not sure why the average rating is so high.  My friend and I got there on a Monday night around 5:45. The place was dark and practically empty. I started getting panicky that we would not get our orders in before happy hour ended at 6. The server came and brought us water at 5:50 and then didn't come back until right before 6. We made happy hour, but barely. I don't know why the server was taking her time - there was one other table so it's not like it was busy. Hate when people make me nervous.  Anyway, to the rolls. They have a huge list of specialty rolls, but 95 percent of them are deep-fried, baked, stuffed with cheap imitation crab or cali rolls. Only a few had fresh fish in them. So far, not impressed.   We ordered the spicy salmon and tuna, which were big, chunky and quite spicy. I was happy with these. I ordered a Dbacks specialty roll which was tasty but not amazing. My friend and I shared the Mermaid, which was half price after 6:30, and that was OK. Again, nothing to write home about. Specialty rolls range from $8-12, but they're stuffed with the cheap stuff, so I don't know if they're worth it.  In the end, we had 5 rolls, no drinks and the bill came out to $35, which, if the quality was superb, I would not have had a problem with. I don't think I'd go back, it just wasn't worth it.",

Good taste over all and great prices.The only thing that did gross me out was that outside of the location there was a sewer problem and there was basically feces and toilet paper coming out of a hole in the ground,which was really Gross. I don't know if it was the restaurant itself or if it was the Plaza but it was very very close to the restaurant.",

    "text": "My friend and I finished a workout and realized we were hungry and craving sushi.  We were frantically trying to find a place to eat sushi that was open late.  First of all, there aren't that many great sushi places in the Valley, simply because the fish is not fresh like any of the coastal states.  We were still on a mission.  Saketini's was open pretty late so we made stop over here.  We got a sashimi platter, albacore with crab roll, and a few other things.  The albacore with crab roll (forgot name) was very delicious.  Some of the sashimi peaces were good, but some were not as great.  Overall, we got our fix of sushi at a very late hour.  One thing that drops the rating of the restaurant is we got an automatic 20% tip added on.  We were only a party of two.  I usually leave a pretty good tip, but I do not like it when a restaurant mandates a tip.  A tip is something I feel is up to the customer based on his experience.",

The sashimi was good,  our yellowtail slices where small and thin compared the big thick cuts of salmon and tuna.    All the rolls were very good,  slices could have been sliced a tad bit thinner,   all the cuts were about an inch thick.  Definitely not bit size pieces but it sure didn't fall apart.   The food overall I would have to give it a 4 star.    The reason it got demoted to 3 stars is due to the fact that the bill came out with gratuity of $17 on a bill of $95 before tax.  I understand the need for yours automatic gratuity charge and it is usually used for parties of 6 or more...But it was only a party of 2!!!!",

My only issue is that they don't honor the great prices when you order out. I feel like they are losing business this way. Every time we're too lazy to go out and eat we want to place a take out order. However, when the prices cost double the amount, we typically will shoot for a different place to order take out from. So we don't get food from here as often as we want to. Sad.",

A couple of friends and I stopped in last night for some late night happy hour sushi and drinks. The service in the past has usually not been the best. However, this time our server, Tony, was actually on point.  I ordered my usual Fire Cracker dish and a friend ordered the chicken gizzards. His food was okay but he literally pulled out about half a cup of slivered garlic pieces. WAY TOO MUCH GARLIC!! Mine tasted fine as usual so not too bad there. Our bills were a reasonable price for all we got. So we left fairly happy with our experience.   The reason I am giving this place only 1 star is because of the torture I went through after getting home from dinner. I got the worst food poisoning I have ever had to deal with in my life. I had to make a trip to urgent care this morning after being glued to the toilet all night!   Thanks a lot Saketini!! I won't forget this experience for quite some time.",

There's also a karaoke room. You can reserve it for a group and it's $5 per person 4. The decor is pretty nice too and there are TVs that show sports.  The main thing about the food is that it's ok but at a high price. Definitely had better at a lower price. And the ramen, don't bother getting it. It tastes like store bought package ramen in spicy watered down soup. I had REAL Japanese Ramen, and the one here doesn't compare.  Just make sure you come during regular happy hour for good prices. If you come late at night, there's reverse happy hour which gives you ok prices on a few items.",

The service use to be terrible here. We didn't care because we loved the food so much but I'm happy to say that within the last year the service is much better! They are quick to take your order and we never have any issues with refills. All of the servers are bubbly and very nice as well.

There are specials all day long but our favorite time is dinner for the half price sushi rolls. They have a selection of ten full size rolls for $4.50. The Blonde and I can enjoy a filling meal for under $30. Our personal favorites are the Idaho, the Cinderella and the December 24th. We often add a Vegas or a Rainbow Roll, both of which are not on the happy hour list.    Our group of 16 people this night (normal dining for us is 2 to 4 people) was very diverse, from children the had never had sushi, a couple people that don't care for sushi, and an U.S. Air Force member that had previously been stationed on Okinawa. They created a large rectangular table arrangement for us so we could converse with everyone. The staff was very helpful answering all questions, keeping water glasses full, finding non-spicy, non-sushi items on the menu for the finicky ones, supplying chopsticks with helpers for the less dexterous ones, and meeting the last second requests for extras.    Overall, everyone was pleased with the experience. Our Air Force member complimented the quality of the sushi and ultra-finicky Grandma even enjoyed the tempura shrimp and egg rolls. The Ramen bowls were large and had a nice presentation of fresh vegetable on top. The Blonde and I shared 4 rolls, each was very flavorful and the fish on top of the Rainbow Roll was thinly sliced and very tasty. These sushi rolls are well made and stand up to my heavy handed use of chopsticks. The entire meal was nicely presented as it should be since sushi is edible art.    This is a hidden gem. They are open until 2 AM making it an ideal spot for a late bite to eat. It is rarely busy enough to require a long wait for a table, even at dinner time.  Warm Fuzzies (the good stuff) -Half price sushi happy hour. -Open late. -Daily happy hour specials at the bar. -Well done Sushi rolls and Nigri. -Quiet place for couples. -Pleasant, helpful staff.  Cold Baldies (the not so good stuff) -Full bar but the selection is not huge. -Looks like a bit of a dive. -Needs a website.",

It has never worked and I've check it out of boredom when ever I'm here.   Seriously, if you can't maintain this place with the obvious items that are staring you in the face, it makes me ask are you cutting corners elsewhere in places that matter?

There was only like one or two table sitting there when we got in. And she seated me and my husband in a very small table. We just switched to a bigger table ourselves. Food was ok. Our server was good at most of the time. But later on he just kinda rush to take off the plate while we still working on it. Same thing for the check. We were still eating! Then here comes the worst thing: THEY CHARGE US TIPS FOR US (ONLY 2 people)!!! Are you kidding me? I have never had a restaurant charge tips for only 2 people! We usually tip out 20% after tax. Too bad!",

The Happy Hour deals don't seem like much for me but the Half Off Sushi is decent. There are at least two or three rolls for me there as I do not eat any raw sushi, I only eat the cooked or baked rolls. I like their ideas for rolls and their presentation is nice. They seem to have a good variety for all types of sushi lovers. Some of the rolls are very pricey though so be prepared to possibly spend over $10 on certain rolls.",

Now the outside of the establishment will fool you; it could use a nice clean up.  The inside is clean, nicely decorated, and quite inviting.  We went for happy hour ($2) wells-can't beat it.  The sushi had pictures (I need pictures) it was reasonably priced for regular price but many was on happy hour!  I always get the \"Viva Las Vegas Rolls\" at RA Sushi and decided to give it a try here...SUPERB! I received more of the roll and cost much less.  I also tried the spicy tuna which was excellent as well.  All I can say is they have a new fan...I will be back again and again.   The service was really good as well.

We sat down and the server came right over and gave us our menus and took our drink orders.  They seem to have a decent drink menu here and we both ordered chocotinis.  The drinks came out and they were tasty!  YUM!!  Anyways, we ended up ordering some food, and whatever we did end up eating was delicous!  (Daniel the expert did the ordering knowing that I am new to this.  We did a few different things and they were delicious.)  Place is cute and well decorated.  Being a novice to this, I was happy with the taste and display of the food that we ate.  I really had a good time here.  As the night went on, we did end up seeing more people come into the resturant,  but that wasn't for a while.  Service was great, and overall I had a good experience.  Will return in the future.",

Now, I only really get sashimi so if you really like sashimi, this place has- according to me- has some of the better tasting ones I have had around here. It's a great atmosphere and i'm probably bias because of my history here.   Happy hour and reverse happy hour are great so if you haven't tried this place at least try it at those times! Try the albacore and salmon, delicious!",

They also seem to charge a $20 flat rate with an added 18% gratuity no matter what.  We got the cherry blossom roll (they mistakenly label it as maki) packed with tuna and salmon. Was quite crudely made but I'm willing to let it slide as we ordered at 1:29 am and they still made it for us even though it was cutting it close.  The fish quality could be better but I'm giving it a pass because it is Arizona (far from the sea, less seafood consumption)  Quite pricey though 12.99 for a semi-decent product Will definitely keep location in mind where I move in the future in accordance to seafood.... Arizona is not it",

Can't speak too much for the drink specials because I always get their signature saketini, which is made with absolut and some green tea liqeuor. I highly recommend this drink because it's smooth, slightly sweet, and has that nice green tea flavor I just love.  We're pretty boring when it comes to rolls--got the crispy california, the shrimp tempura and the firecracker, which was a jumbo jalepeno popper with spicy crab in it. Oh man, it was all glorious. I've had the spicy tuna there also, and the dragon. It's all good to me.  They always have some crazy creation on the sushi board and the staff is always friendly. You're better off sitting at the bar--we go for games--as it seems the servers are more attentive there (or at least they're always back there doing stuff).  Try it, and keep a business alive.",

There is indoor seating ranging from bar, sushi bar, to normal sit-down tables. I've been here several times during the weekday evening. It hasn't been busy so I have always been seated immediately and received fast service. This place has such a wide variety of sushi! I am always impressed by the available options. Price is pretty average for sushi and serving size is pretty standard as well. Only downside to this restaurant is that I feel the Japanese food could be more authentic.",

    "text": "I want to give Saketini a better review, because I've happily been eating here for years. But they've done me dirty a few times recently, so I can't.   The last 2 occasions the blonde female bartender auto-gratuity'd our bill... on a 2-top? We were weekly regulars until this dishonesty happened... twice. I guess if what you want is an 18% tip I'll give it to you, but generally ya'll deserve a bit more for the attentive and friendly service. Ultimately I feel like you're trying to swindle me into not realizing the tip is built into the bill and have me still tip you on top of that. i glanced at other reviews before posting and noticed this is a common theme so I don't feel wrong in my accusations. Also, I have recently worked in the restaurant industry, and had for about 8 years, and I seem to remember that all restaurants in AZ did away with auto-gratuity back in 2013. Seems a little fishy.   So, aside from this bullshit, I'll give an honest review of the food. They make some delicious plates.   They open at 3pm, and run 3 different happy hour specials. I liked to go at 5:30 to take advantage of the special that ends at 6 and the new one that starts. The one that starts at 6 has some of my favorite rolls (Little Mermaid, December 24, Idaho, Cinderella, Fire, Doggy Bag, Bronze Medal .. IN THAT ORDER!). I only ever order Mermaid & December recently but the others I listed will also satisfy your Americanized sushi hunger.   Titanic is my absolute favorite roll. I'm going to update this review when I can recall what fish is on it, but it's ginormous and topped with fresh yummy seafood. No extra distracting sauces, and you'll struggle to pop a whole piece in your mouth.   Mondays are 5$ Sake-Bombers with your choice of a giant Sapporo or Kirin! Normally 8$ so Monday is a good time.",

Why not 5 stars though? Because the food is not spectacular. It's never bad though. Great place for drinking with friends. Servers are all cute and friendly.

    "text": "This is the closest sushi place to me after Crazy Sushi & Crab (see previous review) and Senor Sushi (due to reviews, I have no plans to go here.) I live in the heart of Mesa's Asian Business District, so I rarely venture outside of it for the foods that I love.   Saketini has a decent happy hour and several rolls. People love this place and are regulars. I've been a couple of times and even brought friends. One of the last times I ordered off the happy hour menu I thought, wow there's a lot of crab mix in here (a roll that the main ingredient was supposed to be tuna.) I gave them the benefit of the doubt and thought, well maybe they're just having an off day. I went back this weekend and was disappointed, because they're stuffing the rolls with crab mix when that's not what is being advertised; the last time wasn't a fluke. If I wanted a California roll (which is not even proper sushi), I would have ordered one. I asked the waiter if he could ask the chef about it and the waiter began to argue with me and eventually said, well it's probably just to bring costs down. I said, oh okay I understand, we'll take the check. I won't go back. If you claim to be a sushi place, why are you cutting corners? It's a culture, it's an art. Maybe their specialty rolls are better and the happy hour rolls are a scheme to make extra money with small portions? Who knows. I'm not really interested in going back. Really, it's a shame, I liked going there.  Side note: I feel like an absolute fool for forgetting that Toh Zan Nagasaki Grill is within WALKING distance from Saketini, has glowing reviews, and every time I drive by I go, \"I still need to go in there! Definitely a Japanese mom and pop place.\" I've looked at the menu and it looks amazing and well priced. I will be going there the next time I am craving sushi.",

Waited to be greeted for five minutes while the hostesses had their back towards us refusing to acknowledge us.  Finally a waiter came over to ask us if we've been helped.    After we review the menu we place the order, we find out they won't honor the happy hour pricing.  The menu doesn't say eat in only... but whatever.  Ordered a rainbow roll, none of the fish was cut correctly.   December 24th and cherry blossom rolls were pretty good.  Yellow fish roll was just okay.  Idaho roll was pictured with more masago... better off just buying the Californian roll for half the price.   Overall we were unhappy with our experience, especially in regards to customer service.  For the price, literally anywhere else would be better.",

We felt rushed and didn't feel as if we could relax and enjoy the atmosphere. It was almost as if she wanted us to leave because the place had a waiting list but they just opened. When the bill came I was surprised to see gratuity of 18% was added automatically for four people. When I asked about it she said the system automatically adds it if the bill is over $60. Didn't feel the service was worth the 18%. I would have given at least 15% even with the ok service but shouldn't have to be required to give 18% if we were not given good service. I would be cautious for those who wouldn't expect this. Just wished our service was better",

The vegas roll was good, but the rainbow roll was flavorless.   the squid salad was by far the best thing we had here; in fact, the only thing I would say that was actually good!  the worst things were a tie; our waitress was terrible. there was only one other party in the entire restaurant while we were there, and the waitress was still completely inattentive.  The other half of the tie was the edamame. Someone else got to ours first; a member of my party found a maggot in her edamame! This is where the wait staff fell apart. They didn't even apologize, and didn't take it away. I had to get up and carry the edamame dishes up to the sushi bar so they wouldn't be sitting on our table!

I haven't had their food yet, but I have partaked in their fantastic drink specials.  They have $2 well drinks for happy hour.  Woo hoo! Plus they have a reverse happy hour too, which scores them another star.  Any place that offers late night drink and food specials is alright in my book.  Once I try the food, I'll be back and I'll update the review.",

They are big fans of putting lots of sauce on your rolls. so if you order any rolls with sauces expect a lot more than usual. The rolls here are wrapped smaller and tighter than most but the rolls are much longer. I enjoy this place but really only go here during the late night happy hour. because the specialty rolls are about 17-24 bucks and i would much rather pay a third of the cost. the only thing I don't really like is the high price and the slow waitress. I cant really say anything bad about the food.",

Personally recommend the jelly fish rolls.   Only thing that is gratuity is automatically added to your bill which is understandable but kind of off cause sometimes the service isn't as great as the gratuity that they add on top of the bill.   Food wise & cost is great though!",

It does have good specials between happy hour and half off sushi specials they have some of the best xeals cor sushi in town.

Or issues with suoer slow service . and incorrect orders .   But just recently was the last straw that made the deals no longer worth it.  Both me and my friend got food poisoning from here. And that's just not okay. I've always told people about this place with a grain of salt and said the deals are worth some of the things wrong but now I will tell people to stay away all together.

We got the Gyoza, Chicken Wings and Seaweed Salad. For the sushi, someone in my party got the Bronze Medal, another got the Crazy Boy (California Roll Deep Fried) and I got the Fire (Crab, avocado and cream cheese). Atmosphere: it says they a \"Lounge\" and I'm not exactly sure where that branding comes from. I did not get the vibe of a lounge. You do see the chefs making the sushi right behind the bar, which tugs at my heart strings for transparency reasons and that is awesome.   Food Selection: Honestly the best happy hour for sushi. All rolls were $4.75 (on their happy hour menu) and appetizers were around $4 or $5. They had 3 or 4 rolls that were deep fried (my FAVORITE) and were SO good. Th Gyoza sauce was also great. WARNING the sesame chicken wings are sneaky spicy. I did not try any, but my friends loved them and claimed the spiciness.   Beer Selection: honestly not that great. I get it, they don't specialize in beer. We didn't get a beer menu (which is just disappointing), and I almost ordered a bottled beer vs what was on tap because we couldn't see the tap from where we were sitting.   Customer Service: I think our experience could have been a tad bit better. There wasn't anything necessarily wrong with our server, she was just SO quiet that I could barely make out the beer options she told us. But we were able to cancel our bottled beers we ordered after we found out what was on tap, which was super sweet of her to do since they were already opened.",

If you're looking for authentic sushi I wouldn't imagine you would want to come here because I did feel like a good amount of their rolls were deep fried or had deep fried things in them.  I personally thought they were really delicious, though.  I would recommend this place for an affordable meal and a few drinks because they always have happy hour specials or late night happy hour specials as well!",

Not a big fan of the new ways of making the rolls and sushi.  They still have a GREAT happy hour as far as the food prices go, but the food has gone downhill.   Crunchy California roll is still good. They don't sear the Albacore anymore. They have a website now, but nothing too great.  The one upside was that the two servers that were working last night were great.  Really fast and on top of things.",

The waitresses weren't very helpful. We had to flag them down to order before happy hour ended. The menu is huge, mainly consisting of deep fried or baked items. I'm not a fan of sushi restaurants that aren't real sushi. I had a hard time finding fresh, raw items on the menu. Finally decided on a spicy salmon, spicy tuna, Little Mermaid (shrimp tempura w/spicy crab), Lollipop (white fish, salmon, avocado) and Dynamite (shrimp tempura with baked fish on top with a creamy sauce). They were all OK. I've had better, fresher sushi elsewhere. I won't be back.   Also, the bathrooms didn't have any toilet paper or paper towels to dry your hands.",

    "text": "Saketini has many fond memories for me; I have been coming in as a regular now for almost four years and will continue to keep coming back despite the fact that it has steadily declined since I started going.   So what works at Saketini? Well, their happy hour menu is to die for. They have half-price sushi and rotating drink special EVERY night. They also have reverse happy hour Mon-Thurs, which is fantastic. Their menu is extensive and has a picture book companion, which works out really well when I bring friends who don't partake in sushi often.   I will say that I only partake in the veggie sushi and mock crab, but even with this limitation I always have enough to eat and they are very good about making certain rolls veggie for me. My favorite roll is the Fire Roll, which is mock crab, avocado and sour cream that is fried and then doused with spicy mayo. Again, it used to be better when I first started coming, but it's still worth the half-price.   Now what doesn't work? I would not pay full price for any of the items I get, except maybe the Fire Roll. I almost exclusively only go during Happy Hour or Reverse Happy Hour. The service is usually terrible unless it is super slow; they are almost always understaffed. My group was seated on the little \"banquet room\" once and the music was horrendously loud. We asked at least ten times to have it turned down before they did so. TEN. TIMES.   Not in a rush? Okay with mediocre service? Want cheap sushi/drinks but only at a certain time? Then Saketini is the place for you.",

Another best friend in town, and we hit the place about 5:30 on Friday night (happy hours are 4-6). She got a Saketini which is the signature drink. I had a sip and it was very tasty!  We also got two apps: Gyoza and Edamame. Both perfect.   For our sushi, we went with: Spicy Tuna, Avocado, a Salmon, and a Crunch Roll. All were very good. Plenty of food for the two of us to come out full!  Service once again was stellar. Water stayed full and our waitress answered my questions well about just what makes the Spicy Tuna spicy!  Total bill was just over $28 with tip. Love it!",

    "text": "Very mixed feelings here....  the sushi is great....VERY tasty. The red dragon roll was soooooooooo good. In fact, all the rolls were very flavorful. The nigiri was ok.....I think it's more about the maki then anything at this place. (the other food was kind of mediocre.....the teriyaki is bleh, and the (tuna, was it?) cheek was overcooked and not seasoned)  However......  I'm giving two stars because service. is. horrible.  There were probably about 50 people there last night (when we were leaving, they said it was weird for it to be that busy on a Thursday, normally Monday's are bad....go figure) Anyways, with 50 people there, there were only two servers. (they said one got sick and didn't show.....but, apparently their phone must not have been working either, because they failed to call someone else to come in) So, right from the get go, service was slow. It took a good 10 minutes before anyone attended us after being seated.  A weird thing was, we told the Maitre'D (who was also the other server) that we would possibly be 4, but the others were late. She insited we sit at a small two seater table until we were sure they were coming, to keep the big tables open for groups (wait a sec.....I just realized they said it's 'weird to be this busy on a Thursday'......huh. strange.) Anyways, our friends did end up coming and we had to move tables in the middle of our meal.   The happy hour is....not the best, anyways. My husband ordered a wells, after another 10 or so mins of waiting, he asked about his drink, which the server said they were out of, then realized they WEREN'T out, and 20 minutes later finally brought the drink..... The thing about the sushi on the happy hour menu is that, for 4.50 you get 4 pieces. My friend had to order two because one wasn't enough. So, she ended up paying full price anyways.   As for the restaurant itself....it's caught between two worlds. I'm not sure if it's more restaurant, or more club. In either case, it needs a face lift. It feels like an old cruiseship.....(brown and orange aren't the most inviting colors).....The people that were there were pretty much all under 25 and loud and rambunctious....It was about 10:30 at night, but...I didn't think this was a club.......   I think I'll bookmark this place as one to come to when everything else is closed (they're open till 2am) and I get that midnight sushi craving, otherwise; Thank you, but I'll pass......",

It had been really slow that day and they might close early. The Sushi rolls were very good, hence the 4 stars, my friend order a Hello Kitty drink, it was pretty and pink and was really good, and the other drink my other friend had was great.

The happy hour menu is pretty substantial, consisting of various sushi rolls, nigiri, and appetizers such as tuna tataki and Hawaiian poke salad.  The Hamachi kama here is also pretty delicious and the large \"Korean\" menu always presents me with something new worth trying.  Hell, I think they're one of the very few places in Phoenix that serves okonomiyaki and ochazuke.  The staff are all very friendly and you can not only sit at the bar or a table, but some lounge chair area dealio near the entrance.  Pretty sweet.  Also, they have any major sports events on the big flatscreen lcds at the bar.  All in all, an uber sweet weekly hangout with great food and even better drink specials.  *edit* The addition of an inexpensive private karaoke room further enforces the five star rating",

    "text": "This is what Yelp is for, as I can now fully express my absolute passion for this place.  Now I have been around the block a few times when it comes to sushi and this place is my one of my favorites. The octopus is fresh and cold, the sake is nice and hot and the trance music is sometimes LOUD and somewhat obnoxious. When I think of my fish place, I like to have all three. Events like naked sushi have been known to happen there and in my book that gives a place a character. I might just have to tell someone about it. So here goes:   Now I have to start somewhere so I will start by giving mad props to the sushi chefs. After all that is what you go there for right? (Maybe naked sushi) These guys get fresh fish in the desert and they make it look GOOD( and keep it smelling good too). The squid looks like it was pulled out of the ocean mint accent and decoration included. The detail of the appearance is a big deal to me when I think raw fish. Now we shan't forget we are in Mesa but this is darn good.  Mostly I sit at the sushi bar and the guys have always been top shelf. They occasionally give you stuff to try, and if they see you on a date they made slide you some fruit with whipped cream on it. I feel like I am really taken care of every time I go there. I have never had a bad meal or a bad experience.  Their drink menu is pretty sweet too if you are into mixed booze. Try the signature drink a \"Sakitini\" :0  I have been here plenty and the service is always swift, sweet and sorta shy. This place is my friend and I's solace at 1am in a Tuesday night for a late night sushi run. For me,  as good as it gets so close to my house and a little better:)",

We were there for the Happy Hour, which is an amazing deal and it is all fresh and absolutely tender and delicious.  I recommend the Little Mermaid roll for those who like a little bit of a kick and a crunch, and also the Plum Kiss mixed drink if you want something a little sweet.

We had a total of 4 rolls, 1 large sake bomber, and 2 shots and it came to a bit over 30 dollars. This was during reverse happy hour, but that's still pretty good.  Bottom line: I CAN'T WAIT TO GO BACK! :D",

    "text": "YAY for another good find!!!   Saketini has great service, wonderful chill atmosphere and a large food/drink menu. They have seating at the sushi bar, seating at the regular bar and then also table seating. They have daily deals..yesterday (Monday) was 1/2 off sake bombers..can i get a WHOOP WHOOP?!?  They have an extensive sushi menu with both cooked and raw sushi.  We tried the Firecracker and they even let us add avocado into it. It was baked to perfection and we absolutely loved them. If you're not a huge raw sushi fan there are multiple options that consist of cooked sushi and whoever is serving you will be more than happy to suggest what you might like best. They also have a full non-sushi menu as well.  Shrimp tempura and edamame were delicious as well.  Four rounds of sake and three plates all for $37 duckets!  Check Saketini out !. Good food, service and atmosphere. You will find a deal that will work with you.. happy hour or reverse happy hour ,you 're bound to find something that will fill your belly with deliciousness and a drink that will warm ya up!",

My friend insisted on me to try their sushi, so i ordered a dragon roll which is my favorite roll. The roll came to me with some mushed elk and salmon on top, literally it was gross. i grabbed a bite to taste, because i was curious about it. I don't know if the chef knows what he is doing or just throwing bunch of stuff in a roll.  I hate to be critical but when i complained to the server who was extremely nice and told me the manger can't do nothing about it and we have to charge you. I was completely shocked and thanked her for the service but i would never ever come to such place.",

However I felt like their menu was virtually all the same just mixed up in a different way, it seemed to me it was all shrimp, crab, avocado, cream cheese, cucumber, sprouts, eel sauce, and then a few variations were thrown in of course and then they were just mixed around. Don't get me wrong I love all of those combinations but there wasn't really a large variety of fish - so if you're a beginner to sushi this is the place to go, really wish I would've known about this when I first started eating it.",

While on the topic of ordering, we went with a group of 20ish people who all arrived at different times. Drink orders were handled relatively quickly but not refilled as emptied. My friends had pre-reserved for the amount of people we had and they had us in an elevated room with a U-shaped table arrangement which forced more than half the group to face the backs of the others. When the one waiter they gave us took our orders, he expected us to order everything we wanted at once. It's a sushi restaurant and I want a steady trickle of dishes. I didn't order everything at once and then had to wait while he returned to the group 4 times before he'd stop to take another order. Yes we had a big group, but he added an 18% tip onto our bill, which would be fine if he deserved it or if we had more than one server. The Korean kitchen menu is lackluster. Hopefully the quality of food is usually better but the Crown Cali Roll tasted like cat food and neither it nor the Signature roll resembled their menu image. We will not return.",

The sushi was not bad- definitely could have been more fresh but overall good.  However when the check came we were not impressed at the 20% gratuity automatically added to our bill. We were a party of TWO, so it did not seem to me necessary or appropriate. Usually gratuity is only tacked on to the bill with a group of 4 or more. So it was almost a bit of a slap in the face as if to say we were not trusted to tip enough. Besides the fact that tips should be based on SERVICE and the amount should be left for the CUSTOMER to decide. As a person who usually tips well, it left a bad taste in my mouth. The food at Sakatini is too mediocre to overshadow their callousness with the gratuity. I will not be returning.",

I only live 4 blocks from this place and when I got home the sushi had fallen apart it was just thrown together there was wasabi all over the place and eel was very chewy. I know this place has gotten great reviews but I think I'll travel a bit further for my sushi next time. I definitely will not be returning to this location.",

    "text": "Gotta love a place that has 2 happy hours... even if their happy hour menu is a bit limited.  I bet this would be a great place to drink. Unfortunately, I was pregnant when I discovered it and now, I have a newborn so I'm still not drinking. haha  That said, the sushi and udon are pretty tasty and I love that they're open late-night.  Everyone that I've taken has liked it and I think it would be a good date night spot, as well.    See ya there!",

They are also open until 2am and serve food up 'til !:30am, which is convenient for people who work later in the night.",

    "text": "\"No vaporizers please!\" just a heads up. So this place and I have a interesting history. One time I was there and they had a power outage. And then the entire staff went outside to try and figure out what the problem was. WITHOUT SAYING ANYTHING TO THE CUSTOMERS. Now I understand this is a pretty extraordinary situation but WHERE IS YOUR PREPAREDNESS? Why didn't anyone teach these people what to do in this situation. I could have just left without paying since no one spoke to me for 20 minutes while I waited for my check in the dark. But I'm not a thief. I waited. Although there had to be some sort of safety regualtion against that actually happening. They should have addressed the customers first, closed tabs, and evacuated, but they seemed to not really give a shiitake about any of the customers.   ANOTHER TIME. I waited a full half hour before anyone even asked me if I wanted to order. I was surprised after eating that they weren't going to comp the meal. I mean I would have paid for the drinks, obviously. Anyway they made it a BIT better by taking off 20% from the bill but I was disappointed that was all they were willing to do. I know this may sound like I'm coming off as entitled, but it's just the differences between excellent business and mediocracy. Had they comped 50% or more of the meal, this review might be three.  Oh the food is decent, fairly priced for a sushi place if you go in during happy hour or reverse happy hour, but as is expected their portions are really small.",
