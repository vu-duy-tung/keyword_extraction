    "text": "I give this place 3.5 stars. The decor and space was amazing..very spacious  and very nice design.  The staff was friendly- but our server was a little flighty- I don't think she had been working there very long as she wasn't very familiar with the menu and had to ask us what the menu said. I am a restaurant manager and I would never put someone on the floor who wasn't familiar with the menu- it looks bad on the serve and on management. We ordered 2 ribeye dinners and 1 chili cheeseburger. My brother requested his steak to be rare and when it came to our table it was more on the well side and when he asked  to have it sent back and cooked the way he wanted the man- who I am assuming was the manager- acted like it was a hassle. My steak was slightly overdone but still edible and tasty. My husbands chili cheeseburger was amazing! The chili was very tasty and it was a huge meal! He left very satisfied! One thing I absolutely loved was the horseradish mashed potatoes- they were amazing! I had never had horseradish m.potatoes but I am glad I tried them- I even started making some at home.  The  mixed drinks were amazing too!  My brother ordered a glass of their dark beer and he loved it- he has always loved dark beers and this beer was right up his alley. Oh! Almost forgot- we also ordered the mini bruschetta for our appetizer- and WOW! I could have eaten 5 plates of that stuff - the best bruschetta I have ever had! Overall this place was really good! The food tasted amazing- I am glad because they are kind of pricey but no complaints on the price because it was worth it :)",

The menu can be overwhelming but the food is consistently good and the service is attentive. I think some of the prices are ridiculously expensive  ,like who would pay $16 for spaghetti,  but I don't blame this location. In summary, the food and service is good and the menu offers a nice variety.",

But Bjs still has the ingredients to make it and they just made it for me a couple of days ago, but now they're saying they don't have the stuff to make it anymore. Which is completely fine. But the head manager was so incredibly disrespectful to me and raised her voice a bit and was demeaning. I don't know if it had something to do with my race, but she was completely rude. I can't believe that  bjs would let someone like that hold such a title or position for there company with that kind of attitude.",

That could have been the server or the kitchens error but with as much as I had already heard about the servers day I was intimidated to say anything, I didn't want to add to his day.

Enjoyed some wine and our food came.  It was amazing tell my sisters order came out.   She told the waitress clearly no no chicken.  She only eats seafood.  So she orders a shrimp salad. And got a chicken salad.    We had to complain 2 times. Normally love eating here.  They have us 2 free deserts for our large table.  That's what saved the rating.  It would have been a 2 star.

    "text": "Important points, good food, fair service. Our server was very attentive, refills on drinks, fast calamari-hot crispy..good.  It took 6-minutes.  She was the perfect server, but stuck with looking bad because food takes longer.  BJ management can see on the food tickets on how long the food takes.  Get with it guys,  BJ's has a menu unmatched but service has always been a tad challenging.  We sat on a Sunday.  the wait was 10-15, and we got in in 10.  That's good.  Religiously, the food takes a while, but a quality product take time.  it shouldn't take 25-mites for a lunch.  Just think if you have a 1/2-hr for lunch I would not go here. BJ's consistently takes longer.   They can improve, but my past 5-years of eats has shown otherwise.  Dinners are 28-32-minute wait, great quality, and the TV's are what can help pass the time.  I hate to sound racist but, my 15-years of food service industry, I'd hire Hispanic cooks.  You can bet if you go to any restaurant and there are Hispanic folks cooking, it will get to you fast.  It will be quality food. We had a hand battered chicken strips, very good.  The green chili burger was thick, hot and tasty.  Not real juicy, cooked well done, but I had a bite it was good.  I had the Asian salad, which was great, with the crunchy won ton skins mmm good.  My son got the pepperoni deep dish, which is just like Gino's East in Chicago...amazing.   This is why I gave this place 4-stars.  If they can serve their lunches in 15-minutes, and dinners in 18, then they'd be a hit.",

I tried one of their blonde beers, and was delighted with the taste.  I did notice my mouth was really dry about an hour after eating, so I kinda think they must use flavor enhancers like MSG.  MSG doesn't sit well with me - makes me tired and thirsty.  I also had a glass of tea which was very strong and nice to drink.  They offer various flavors of tea, but I just had mine \"plain\".  Definitely worth a visit!",

So there was a night where I was hungry and because it was a holiday, most other places were already closed. I decided to give BJ's another shot out due to convenience. I ordered the flatbread nachos and a california club. Simple instructions on these items were, no sour cream and jalepenos on the flatbread, and no bacon on the sandwich. I was happy to see when I got my order that the flatbread was correct. The guy at the counter repeated my order exactly without looking at it so I had assumed he checked it too. I decided not to check the sandwich since the flatbread was right. I got home and decided to open up the sandwich just to make sure it was good and bacon! Including the last two visits that made me quit going months ago, this would be the third time in a row I got a messed up order. I don't blame the guy at the counter, because even if he looked, the bacon isn't super visible. I blame whoever is actually putting the food together. Something still isn't right and it needs to be fixed.",

Bursting with flavor. The burger was on a grilled sourdough bread with avocado, green chilies, pepper jack cheese, chipotle mayo, and ranch. Burger was very moist and perfect. It came with shoestring fries. Half the plate was filled with fries. It was a huge lunch meal but really worth it.   As for the service, our server was always checking on us. Refilling our drinks and clearing the empty plates. We even had the manager come by to make sure everything was okay. It seemed like they really cared for us.   So overall, I would say that we had a really enjoyable time. We had a table over 10 people and the service and food came out in a reasonable time.

BJ's is a large restaurant with a menu that offers something for everyone. We had a short wait to be seated, maybe 10 minutes.  Our server didn't introduce himself. He brought drink refills when needed but was absent most of the meal. C ordered the kids 6\" deep dish pizza. Fruit salad as a side. Our server informed us that the pizza did not come with a side like the other kid's meals. C likes fruit so I said fine, add on the side of fruit. C liked his pizza but not the chunks of tomatoes that were all over it. I ate them. C said the crust was a bit sweet, like Old Chicago's, but it was an ok mini pie. The fruit bowl was a joke. Cubed watermelon with 3 grapes. Pathetic. I ordered the Bacon-Guacamole Deluxe; Guacamole, Smoked Bacon, Pepper Jack Cheese, Chipotle Mayo, Red Onions, Jalapenos & Tomatoes. The burger was cooked right. The chipotle mayo was pretty lame. Not a whole lot of flavor. Overall, it was a decent burger and the side of fries were quite tasty. OK service, lousy fruit side, decent burger & fries, not a very attentive server. 3 Stars",

    "text": "I'm not quite sure exactly how I feel about this place. I took my family (6 ppl) there for my adult sons birthday. The atosphere was great, the decor was very nice, but the service and the food, not so much.  First we had been waiting so long for a table that my family started getting upset that there were families coming after us who were being seated before us and they were just coming in not waiting like we were. It was painfully obvious that the girl running the seating, was very inexperienced and they need someone with more experience.   We were finally seated after about 45 minutes and were really looking forward to having a positive experience. Well, there is always hope.   First the waitress was a bit sloppy and we felt rushed. I use to waitress, you never ever ever rush the people you're waiting on. Then it took about 10 minutes to get our drinks and the only people who recieved water were the people drinking alcohol. There use to be a time that they put in on your table the minute that you sat down.  To make it short and sweet, the food. Waaaay over priced for what you get. The appetizers were just ok. Nothing to get thrilled over. My daughters fish was over cooked, the hawiian rice that it came with was too sweet, there was nothing balancing it out. My sons huge Black & Blue Burger had this little tiny bit of blue cheese on it. My giant baked patato cost over $8 and the toppings were hardly enough for a mini potato. About 5 minutes after I ordered it, I told the waitress that I had changed my mind and she told me that it was too late. Really too late to change my mind on a baked potato? You have got to be kidding me.    I spent almost $200 and left disappointed, that should never happen.",

They make about 9 different beers and the one I ordered was quite good.  Service was prompt and attentive despite the restaurant being quite full.  I would definitely go back and recommend this restaurant to other people.  The one down side is that they do not offer any coffee other than just plain old brewed - no lattes, etc.  They should raise their game on this score.  Prices are reasonable.  Lots of families eating there, but no rowdy children.",

They also do a pizza cookie but I LOVE the fact they have a brownie...mmm! They also do a trio of cookies, which is amazing. The only con's would be price and their chips & salsa. Both can be improved :)",

The one thing I really didn't like was that their menu had too many different types of food and the lunch specials, although plentiful, didn't look all that good to me. So we decided to share a few apps. We got the spring rolls, lettuce wraps, and the mozz and tomato salad. The salad was pretty good, the balsamic on it was tangy and it was a decent deal at 3$. The spring rolls were also just alright....they were like a tex mex spring roll....the plate has a lot of rolls, but the sauces they serve with it weren't very spicy or flavorful. The lettuce wraps were kind of the same way.... they were a bit bland, not bad, but not good. We ended the meal with the triple chocolate pizookie. This was the best part....super chocolatey and delicious. I'd go back if I were in the area, but for the price, it isn't anything special.",

Perhaps it might get you out of a speeding  ticket or get you backstage at a classic rock  dinosaur reunion show but you might end up having to \"prove\" your credentials. So anyway this place is never my first choice but it gets voted in our rotation so I'm a regular  here. The lunch special tacos are light and make for a decent lunch. The miso salmon is also good although a bit pricey. And I must say the Chicken Parmigiana is also quite  doable. Came here once for a happy hour and appetizers were meh. Also, you never know what level of service you'll get. We've got some very professional and courteous waitresses and we also have had our share of either totally clueless or just plain rude waitresses. We never have seen the latter a second time so  that's a good thing.",

By the time we finally were able to leave, we had spent about 2 hours in this restaurant. Not only did we leave dissatisfied, but we also missed a movie that we were planning on seeing ( we had accommodated over an hour and a half to eat). Completely unacceptable. On top of the terrible service, my burger was literally burnt black. But did I want to wait another 15 minutes for the server to come back, and another 20 minutes for a new burger? No, absolutely not. Very upsetting.",

My entree was the prime rib and it was one of the worst prime ribs I have ever had. It was over cooked and overly peppered. Terrible!! The broccoli was under cooked with no seasoning whatsoever.

Last night we visited and I had the best pork chop i have had in years. Perfectly cooked, juicy, tender, perfect.  Our server Christel, was very good, and the perfect mix of attentive without being smothering. Only a couple of negatives. Our biggest gripe is nothing they can do anything about. Its hard to get parking near the actual restaurant due to the stupid mall policy on valet parking closing off otherwise empty spaces near the restaurant so they can be made available for the incessantly lazy lard **s people with nothing else to do with their money than throw it away because they are too important to walk 50 more steps in their life. Rant done! Secondly BJ's fairly recently, (Like maybe even within the last year) changed their french fries offerings from a choice of thin and crispy or \"regular\" to only \"regular\" now which my wife finds to be extremely sub standard compared to the previously thinner fries. Other than that its a great place for consistently good food and service...the active word here being consistency.",

He had no knowledge of the menu- he kept offering items that were not even on the menu and then saying \"Oh sorry never mind you can't get that\".   The food was mediocre at best.. rib eye, mahi-mahi tacos, chicken sandwich were all overpriced and it seemed like the quality was not what it used to be- More bland than it was flavorful.  Anything we requested from our server, such as an extra ranch or drink refill, were forgotten about.   The server ID'd my bf when he ordered a beer and noted that it was his birthday the day before our visit, but forgot it when it was time for dessert and we had to remind him.   We ordered a white chocolate macadamia nut pizookie. The server informed us, to my bf's disappointment, that they were out of vanilla ice cream and will have to give us chocolate instead. My bf is not a fan of chocolate (what a weirdo, right) and passed on the pizookie but they brought out the cookie anyway. About 5-10 mins later, we see dessert plates being brought out with VANILLA ICE CREAM. I guess they restocked but we were not informed, received no apology and the server had made no effort to make things right.   To top off our amazing experience, my bf, my sister and I ended up in and out of the restroom all night from 2 in the morning til now thanks to the mahi-mahi tacos we decided to try. If I had to diagnose that, I'm going to guess that we've got food poisoning.   I called the manager on duty this morning to explain everything that had happened to her and she had no sympathy or desire to make things right.   Don't waste your time or your money! There are sooo many other options than a place that has no respect for your needs or your time. You. Deserve. Better.",

    "text": "We go here quite frequently for dinner and there have been a few times food has lacked quality. The really uncomfortable part lately has been bringing to what seems like a newer manager; a male, Caucasian, short hair, maybe early or mid 40's, spites me of a military background. This was the second time with him that we had brought a bad visit to his attention and both times I really don't feel sincerity, he just seems very robotic and rambles on in a monotone voice; just seems fake. Anyway, we do enjoy some of the food but when it comes to customer service I'm not sure someone of that caliber should be leading the pack.  Double check your receipts, we found items that should of been discounted at full price and items that should of been comp'd.",

The previous time we came the waiter seemed like he could care less about helping us and that was last year. This time we sat for 20 minutes and not even one person came to say that someone would be there shortly nor did we even get offered our drinks while we waited for the waiter. My sister, who is 6, received a regular menu and was not even offered a kids menu but we couldn't even get someone over to swap it out. The waiters would shake their heads after leaving their customers' tables and just shows the care they have for being there. We ended up leaving because if those 20 minutes of wait were an indicator of how our dinner was going to be, we might as well go elsewhere.",

We order boneless chicken wings they where over cooked and dry and very crunchy. We also ordered calamari was not good at all it was waaay over cooked also.

The employees seem to busy to say hello or even acknowledge it's customers.  It takes far to long to be greeted and or seated.  During my last visit I ordered a drink, deep dish pizza and asked for water.  However, in my hour and half visit the water never arrived and I was not offered a refill even though it was included.  The taste of the pizza was fair but seem to lack sauce.  So, I asked my hard to track down waiter about the sauce and he offered to bring a side of it to the table.  That was a nice gester, but it would have been nicer to dip my warm pizza into warm sauce instead of sauce that was very cold seeming to have come straight from the refrigerator.  I would not recommend this Bj's is you are looking for attentive service and hospitality.  They continue to fail in both of those areas.  Sincerely,",

    "text": "I do my ratings and reviews based off of Customer Service, Quality, Taste, and portion size of the food and drinks, and the cleanliness and style of the restaurant.....  This is by far a new favorite place for me and my husband..... Me, my mother, husband and 5 month old son went to the restaurant on a weekday night around 10:00pm after leaving the movies..... ( We Saw \"Brave\" Great Movie)   Anyhow, lets get right to the important stuff when we entered the restaurant it was very clean, the setting was very romantic, it is a very smooth relaxing place for grown mature adults and families....  We received Friendly customer service immediately as soon as we walked through the door.... Since it was a pretty late  Monday nite  it wasn't too busy so, our waitress informed us that we could sit wherever we pleased.... We took a seat in a nice big round booth that was pretty comfy....   The waitress was very nice and pleasant..... Their menu is huge they have everything from Lobsters to burgers, salads, pizza and everything in between except for breakfast.... They specialize in freshly brewed beer and drinks.... Me and my husband don't drink so unfortunately I can't give a review on the alcohol.... Once seated the waitress took our drink order and me and my mom ordered they're Strawberry-Lemonade...... It was cool and refreshing, very tasty, the drink had plenty of strawberries the lemonade was not tart or too sweet, it was just right..... The waitress told us that they make it fresh every morning.... They actually charge per glass for the strawberry-lemonade..... But, our waitress gave us free re-fills...... (So in return she received a huge tip)   So on to the best part.... (I did taste everyone's dish)The food was Hot, freshly made, and very flavorful....  My mother ordered grilled pork chops with mashed potatoes and veggies.... Her meal also came with this awesome sauce which I will get into in a moment....  The grilled pork chops were so tender and juicy the seasonings and flavors were just right..... I will most definitely be ordering that next time I go again..... They also gave my mom this great vinaigrette, red wine, mustardy, type of sauce for the pork chops.... The sauce was amazing.... The mashed potatoes where fresh and hand mashed or blended (either way it wasn't instant mashed potatoes) They were red potatoes and they were seasoned just right and they were delicious.... (my 5month old son loved them) The mixed veggies were steamed and seasoned lightly.... They still had a nice crisp to them and great bright color.....   Now my husband he ordered the salmon with veggies and white rice.... His salmon was very moist and  tasty......  The rice was lite and fluffy..... The veggies were crispy and very refreshing.... My husband had water with his meal....  Last but not least, I ordered the steak salad... The salad was green, fresh, crispy and cool it had romaine lettuce and a lot of other great healthy greens.... the salad came with a very flavorful vinaigrette dressing.... they placed the steak on the side of the plate.... I think that they were a little stingy with the steak.... but other than that the steak was juicy cooked med-well and had a great taste..... The salad was very fulfilling and tasty..... it also came with a piece of bread and it was good nothing to brag about.....   Overall this is one of my favorite restaurants.... Me and my husband usually go here for our date nites and when we want to be romantic..... Its a great atmosphere and the food is amazing.....",

    "text": "We were seated as soon as possible, services started out great and she was quick to serve us our drinks. I ordered a rare burger, I rarely eat burgers but I like rare, she took all of our orders and left. We received our food and I was given a mid well burger. I asked her to remake my burger, she was very courteous and said she asked them if it was a rare. I get the second burger, again mid well. At this point I don't want anything else and send it back, to which she says there's a policy of cooking as close to rare, despite being mid well and the second time I've asked. The manager comes to talk to me and I explain her response and he says she was wasn't clear, and FLAT OUT tells me and my friends the kitchen crew isn't good enough to cook a rare burger. Like, blatantly says he has an incompetent staff. I work in food service and have never heard of any manager ever saying basically his staff isn't up to snuff to cook a 5 oz patty rare. He comped the burger and as soon as we got our checks, I paid cash. The waitress gives me change and shorts me 5 dollars. I ask for the manager and he comes by and is somewhat rude about his approach. I work in this industry, I know sometimes you have an off day, but I received bad food, bad service, and bad response. I will not be returning to this company, I had high hopes but left with a sour feeling of BJ's.",

When he came back, he assured us one of his servers would be over right away to take our order.  Since it wasn't busy, we figured this would be True.  About another 10 minutes went by without being acknowledged by a single staff member, so we decided to leave.  We headed over to Firebirds, where we had exceptional service and excellent HH drinks.",

This location: busy, but service was good especially for how busy they were.   Food I tried: Avocado Egg Rolls--my favorite! So yummy! Mac and Cheese--my least favorite. Dry and tasteless. Roasted Vegetable and Goat Cheese Flatbread--I love anything with goat cheese! Great White Pizza--not bad, not good, did the trick. Pizookie-SEE ABOVE AMAZINGNESSSSSSS",

I have been a customer for a long time but unfortunately the service has gotten to a point where I no longer want to support my local BJ's!   The service is consistently slow, my orders are often wrong, my drinks get refilled with the wrong beverages, and I have not left satisfied in a while. With the new menu change it sealed the deal for me and I think I will travel 5 more minutes to a different brew house.   If you want to go to a restaurant and find yourself twiddling your thumbs waiting for some service then you should definitely come here!   It is very apparent they have management issues.",

The avocado eggrolls are the best! I was not a fan of the california club flatbread appetizer pizza. I like the texture of the crust, but not a big fan of the toppings. I did not think the aioli that was drizzled on it went well with the pizza. But, you may like it because my girlfriend loved it.  The big disappointment was actually the beer surprisingly. i actually enjoyed my hefeweizen very much. Light, full-bodied and flavorful. The red I tried wasn't very good however. My girlfriend's stout was a huge disappointment. It was actually one of the worst stout we have ever had. Not a lot of flavor and had a weird aftertaste.   I actually had better experiences with the BJs in California more, I don't know why. Each chain is a little different I guess.",

He did, however, turn it into an exit only door to cut down on the amount of times it would be opened, (it only leads to the patio) since there was another enclosed door patrons could use. Server was very attentive and usually appeared out of nowhere to fill water and check on us. She was simply amazing.

He acted like it was our fault but in reality it was his and he wasn't paying attention when we ordered.

As for the food, it was a tasty burger; thick and juicy. Perfect-o. The service was as snappy as they were friendly, and they hook up the military and vets with freebies on Veterans Day, which earns them a star as well. Thank you BJs.",

We started out with some artichoke dip and it literally looked like someone emptied the bottom of the chip bag onto the plate and stuck some dip next to it. I understand our appetizer was just chip and dip but the way it came out looked sad. My husband got the White pizza and I got the Parmesan crusted chicken. We always get there white pizza and it never disappoints. It's probably one of the few dishes that's always consistent every time we come here. My Parmesan chicken was ok. It came with two large sized chicken with a side or mashed potato and broccoli. I would have liked some more veggies with my dish because they gave me two pieces of broccoli and that was it. The chicken had a good crisp and it would have tasted better over pasta and not as a main dish. Everything from the start was just not great and I left dinner disappointed and regretting that we came here. I don't think I will be coming back anytime soon.",

Haven't gone to one since moving, visited this location in Arizona to see that certain items like the portabella mushroom pizza is gone, the menu has blown up 1000% in size, and the food has gone to total crap. You couldn't drink enough of their overpriced alcohol to make any of it taste good. The crust on their deep dish pizza used to have a golden crispy accent to it. Now its bleach white, like it never even saw an oven. Absolutely no flavor. Pzookie was tough, no longer that freshly baked soft texture and it had a hint of fishy flavor to it like it was cooked in the same vicinity as seafood. What an absolute mess. Will definitely never revisit this franchise!",

The service was very bad, they give us waiting time of 20 minutes as we requested to sit in the patio since the weather was nice. After 50 minutes of waiting I went to talk to them and was very annoyed, then they seated us but instead of the patio, they give us seats inside. When we mentioned it to them that we requested to be seated outside, the girl said that will be another 20 min wait, even though they had 3 tables open so not sure why they didn't let us sit outside...Anyways, we ordered our food and everyone's food came except mine. I ordered Caprese with fries. It's literally cheese and tomatoes sandwich so doesn't take 50 minutes to make it. So the waiter came and apologized and said that the order was taken to another table accidentally and that they are making another one now and that the manager took care of it. It was very annoying waiting 50 min to be seated and on top of that 50 min to get our food. The restaurant wasn't even that busy to give them an excuse that they were busy. One of our friend ordered loaded nachos, which came with basically no cheese, literally they put probably two spoons of cheese on her nachos, and at the end she asked the waitress to bring extra cheese, it was kind of interesting to see Nachos without cheese. Few other friends ordered boneless wings and shrimp plate, they said it didn't taste good as well. But to be completely honest, the Pizookie there was amazing, we ordered all the kind they have on their menu... Overall, sure they took care of my plate and brought the extra cheese but the service wasn't  good at all and very disrespectful for saying that wait is 20 min but in reality we waited 50 min to be seated and not where we wanted.. deff all 10 of us not going there again...",

Just prior to arriving at BJ's our 7 y.o. daughter wanted some pretzel bites from Wetzels and we also decided to get some pigs in a blank for my mother-in-law. We walked into the restaurant where the manager very rudely and loud enough for other patrons to hear tell us we could not bring food from other \"restaurants\" into \"her\" restaurant. Her overreaction was completely unnecessary and very embarrassing to my family and me. Undeterred, we did stay even though we were forced to sit outside, not our first choice of seating arrangements. The wait staff was embarrassed by the actions the manager and they did a great job taking care of us. Perhaps a better way for the manager to handle the situation would have been to offer us a doggie bag or some way to conceal our \"contraband\" so we might have enjoyed indoor seating along with the other paying customers. On an up note the food and libations were excellent; the service was fantastic and I can only hope that the manager gets a scholarship to charm school prior to our next visit.",

Not even exaggerating, EVERY single TV had basketball on... so we asked our server if they could turn ONE TV to the sharks game. So they did and some douche bag at the bar gets upset because the TV in front of him was changed even when there were tons of seats at the bar right in front of the other TVs. Anyways, long story short guy complains, bartender agrees it was stupid to change it, and they change it back to basketball. We were pissed but thankfully, the manager did his rounds to make sure everything was okay and ended up changing another TV for us where we had a good view. Thank you!  We come here very often during football and hockey season. Happy Hour is great, but make sure you sit in the bar area to get HH prices. The great white pizza is amazing, and so is the pizookie!

There is nothing about the food that makes you want to come back...even for bar food. All of the dishes lack flavor. They look pretty on the plate but the flavors are not there. The calamari is dry and flavorless. The wings come dry without sauce; you have to ask them to \"toss the wings in sauce\" to  get what is normal wings(wet wings drizzling in sauce) anywhere else. If you don't ask that, they serve fried chicken with dipping sauces, sorry I can get that at KFC not at a supposed premium bar. The salads taste wilted and the dressings seem to lack flavor. The beer was mediocre. The menu is entirely too large.  This place is a hit because of it's location and it's  atmosphere. It's an upscale sports bar resembling the Yard House  so a lot of people like to come here to have comfortable seating, nice service and nice tv's. But the food was very disappointing and if you care about what you eat, look elsewhere.",

I had some time to kill before I went to a movie and it was July 4th so some of the other places had closed early.  BJ's was pretty empty.  I bellied up to the bar and the bar tender was there instantly.  She was great!  She gave me a menu and gave me a minute to look over a wine list because, silly me, I thought I would have a glass of wine....what was I thinking?  The bartender told me they had a great seasonal brew so I said I would give it a try.  It was a heif...er.....hief....dang, I can't spell it...but you know what I mean and it was good!!  It has a nice cardomon finish but not overpowering at all.    I ordered a Santa Fe Salad and it was delish!  Nicely cooked chicken breast and cruncy tortilla strips.  The dressing was good but a little too much of it.  Still I would order it again but maybe ask for dressing on the side.    The service was stellar.  The bartender, which I could remember her name, was knowledgeable and she was pleasant.  We chatted a bit and she was the same with the other patrons at the bar too.  When you eat on your own it's nice to go somewhere where the service is friendly and welcoming.  They brew the beer here too.  All in all it's a great place with a pretty varied menu and good beer.",

They bring out this mound of red, green, plain nachos with tons of cheese, chili, peppers, etc all over it.  I was thinking this is gonna be good.  After eating the top half of the nachos (the best part), I find myself tasting nothing  but salt salt and more salt.  in the end, im thinking \"Would you like some nachos with your salt?\"    Ive been here at least three times, and probably wont be rushing back anytime soon.",

We had to flag someone down in the middle of our meal to get some waters (which we never got)  Food was sub par.  Avocado egg rolls were just deep fried guacamole.  It felt like I ate 2 avocados as an appetizer.  One minute after my first bite, we got our salads (now I'm feeling rushed) My wedge salad should have been called \"Sliver Salad\" or \"Molehill Salad\"  Not good.  Wife and I shared a pizza which was decent but nothing like the picture in the menu looked like.  Truthfully, I would have returned all my dishes but there was no one to talk to.  I felt horrible for the table next to us.  They had triplets who couldn't have been older than 3.  They waited at least 15 minutes for the server to come up to them and another 15 minutes to get their drinks.  My wife went to the bathroom and saw our waitress in there on the phone complaining to her friend about rent money.  She'd make that money if she focused on her tables.  We left her 10%.  I walked in planning on leaving her 50%.  We'll never go back again.  What a shitty corporate establishment.  My amber ale was good.",

The Pizza is more like something I'd expect to have ordered at Pizza Hut than anything I've had growing up in Chicago.  Have a beer here before seeing a movie next door.

Today, we went for lunch again since BJ's sent my GF a birthday coupon for one free meal.  So we went and she had two chicken tacos in pita bread with chips and salsa.  The chicken tacos, especially in pita bread was super delicious or so she said.  The chips were fast food quality but the avocado dip and the salsa were very good.  I ordered their double brewmaster deluxe burger -- that is two 5 oz. patties with two slices of cheese, bacon, onions, tomato slices, and lettuce -- it comes with a boatload of fries.  It was very good.  A side note --- the have a half pound bacon cheese burger that has essentially the same ingredients but with only one slice of cheese and an 8 oz. patty.  Why would anyone order that for the same price as my double brewmaster deluxe burger???  We ordered two soft drinks too.  They gave her a birthday cookie with a scoop of vanilla ice cream for her birthday.  We were stuffed and the food was good.  I was impressed, especially with the birthday coupon.",

Not attentive, slow, forgot everything, never checked in, drinks took 15 mins after ordering, bad BO, trippin'. Then the food...potato skins were pathetic and no cheese at all on 4 of them. Avocado rolls...part of the pit was in the roll, but they didn't care.  Pizza...cold! Literally took bread and put toppings on it and brought it out. Cheese wasn't melted, nothing stuck, pan wasn't hot. Then it wasn't cut and nothing to serve it with. Complained and they brought another small pizza 20 mins later (everyone was done eating), which was no better.  The manager said he is teaching life lessons in the kitchen and knows they have a lot of fires going on. Weird for him to say any of that, but bottom line fix it! Take care of the customer. Make them happy. Produce good food. Try to do something. After all of this, the manager went to put the pizza in the box and realized it wasn't cut and couldn't get it out of the pan so he dumped it upside down and then flipped the box over. Ridiculous! Toppings everywhere's (since they were never melted or stuck). Then monkey bread...no sauce, dry, over cooked and ice cream. We asked where the sauce was (the butter/cinnamon/caramel stuff) and they said they ran out. So instead of telling us that prior or offering to switch desserts they brought out a dry terrible dessert missing the main ingredients to make it good.   No one cared.  They comp'd the 1 small pizza since we didn't even eat it being it was cold, but nothing else! Party of 8. Major issues. Complaints. 2.5 hours of ridiculous service. Waited 28 mins to get our check after requesting it multiple times. First time in my life I debated walking out and not paying, but we didn't obviously because we are responsible human beings. What a cluster of a place, customer service, management and food!!!",

Under the direction of David Renish the Senior Manager, one of his team members brought to his attention that we dropped some cash on the floor and were unaware of it until the next day.  David Renish called me and texted us that night to let us know that he found it and was going to hold it for us until we were able to visit again.    The genuineness of the team to let the manager know that we dropped cash and did not keep it, is just another reason why we will be loyal customers of BJ's.  I just wanted to let  Chandler BJ's members of the team that they are amazing!!!  Oh and the food and beer are AMAZING TOO!!",

And that was to devour these delicious cookies we'd heard so many delightful things about. Delightful they were (albeit a bit smaller compared to others) but they were indeed delicious. The problem, however, had everything to do with our experience outside of dessert.   The service was slow, and minimal at best. We waited quite a while to get seated in a nearly empty restaurant, only to eventually seat ourselves. We then waited some more before somebody finally took notice to help us. And then waited some more (a ton more) for them to take our order and eventually bring our food. We realized that during the wait happy hour had kicked in, so we ordered a few more things. BIG mistake. Big wait for a big let down.  Just an underwhelming experience all around, and our server was grumpy to boot. Not happy that I recommended this place, and it's highly unlikely that I ever would again.",

Our Server was Ian, he was very informative about the menu and catered to all of my allergy needs. He guided me to the gluten free pizza which was a delicious choice along with a bowl of the broccoli cheddar soup, such a yummy suggestion! My brother didn't want pizza so Ian suggested the roast beef dip and he loved it too! As busy as it was Ian kept our cups filled and was present just the right amount. Thank you for a wonderful experience and for being kind on the eyes! Ask for Ian for your next visit!",

The Corn Fritters with the bacon aioli (which I posted a picture of) were super delicious and only $2.95, I was sad that I had to share...The Jallejulah fries (also pictured) where good too, not as spicy as I would have liked but it was definitely a unique taste.  I had the grilled Mahi Mahi Mahi tacos (guess what? there's also a picture of these!) off the lunch menu and they were quite good.  The tacos came with chips and a small dish of salsa and guacamole.  Not a big fan of the guacamole, it was too soupy for my taste. My friend had chicken tenders they looked good but I didn't try them.  The lunch and happy hour prices are really good.  I love going for happy hour and having the mini pizzas.  Plus I'm a rewards member, so I get points for eating there.",

I came in with 12 people about two hours till closing time and expected the staff to be a bit salty, but they were anything but. Our waitress came in clutch and scored us a nice spot that accommodated everyone - she was super friendly.   Next, David (who I assume is the manager) came in and swept us away. He greeted us in a warm manner and made us feel very welcome. Our appetizers came out quickly and were fuckin' excellent. I swear those mozzarella sticks multiply when you're not looking. The potato skins were amazing, too. We never had to ask for our drinks to be refilled, never had to check if our order was put in correctly, never had to complain - everything was wonderful. When it came time to split the check, things got kind of hairy because we wanted to split one giant ass pizzookie twelve ways - but David was like \"I got you, fam,\" and split that shit up like it was no one's damn business. He was such a sweetheart. The guy taking our cards at the end was hilarious and had a wonderful sense of humor.   Squad will definitely be coming here again. 10/10 would recommend",

    "text": "I am very disappointed in my visit to BJs last night.  I have been to this location a few times in the past so I was extremely excited to have a friend accompany me last night. It started with his drink order Crown and gingerale. Waiter could only find Crown Apple. My friend opted for water instead.  I excused myself and came back with the drink requested (from the bar, bartender said that the waiter must've been confused) . Upon ordering I asked for the Prime rib special (extra well). I asked for asparagus and mashed potatoes but if they could be loaded.  My friend asked for loaded potatoes and the waiter advised that they don't really have loaded but he can add bacon and cheese. Since I'd just asked for that same thing I was a bit confused especially since the times before the waiters just said ok and i received loaded potatoes.  The order comes and my asparagus are old and withered. I send them back.  The waiter says the kitchen manager agreed that those should not have left the back. My steak was medium well at best but I didn't want to send another thing back. We all know the stories.  Finally the manager is making the rounds asking how everything was. I kind of just looked. He asked was everything ok. I responded \"ok\". He asked what would've made things better.  I told him of the issues. He explained how we sometimes have those days where we fall short and that was it. No appetizer for next time, a $5 adjustment or anything. Just that comment and he walked off. I paid and still left a decent tip but I am extremely disappointed and my friend was super unimpressed with BJs. Please do better.  Thanks.",

    "text": "I went to BJs for the first time for a dinner with some old co-workers.  I read the reviews before I went so I had an idea of some of the areas where I might have problems.  I am happy to say that my experience was a good  one.  It was a Sunday evening so that might have helped since it was not very crowded.  The weather was nice so our group of 5 sat on the  patio.  The service we received was very good.  He was attentive and funny.  Also was helpful deciding what to order from the enormous menu.  I had their Pumpkin Ale.  It was decent.  I liked it better than Blue Moon's Pumpkin Ale since I could actually taste hints of spices.  I will definitely try other varieties of their own brews when I return.  Two of the other girls in my group went for the root beer.  I tasted it and it was good but I'm not enough of an expert to say it was any different than A&W in a can.  The other two had mixed drinks and found them to be a bit pricey - $9 for a frozen mixed drink?  The table started with chips and salsa.  Nothing special there at all.  I would pass on that in the future.  I ended up having the steak salad and it was very good.  I liked the touch of the roasted potatoes.   All in all a good visit but the food is on the high side so I can't see myself going there often.  If they had a reverse happy hour like Gordon Biersch I could see myself going more, but due to the price I will save trips here for special treats or during their happy hour in the day.",

Although the food was awesome, our server was less than average.  She seemed as though she would rather be anywhere besides waiting on our table and I really didn't appreciate it.  She didn't bring out any of our food and never checked up on us until we were done with our meal.  The restaurant was not busy at all so that wasn't an excuse.

It must have been the combination of the greens, bleu cheese, turkey, avocado, tomatoes and bacon.  Last night, my son wanted Pizza (A Friday night staple for the kid), so we ordered the Margherita Thin Crust Pizza.  I like an almost cracker crust, but this was way too thin and too crackery.  He ate two small slices.  I know he wants the more flaky bread kind of dough.  They do have a deep dish, but we're not into that either.    I ordered a Wedge Salad.  My brother-in-law asked what the hell it was and why I have half the iceberg on my plate.  I don't like iceberge lettuce, but this is almost embarrasing to admit that I do like this salad!   I know it doesn't have any nutritional value.  Heck, it has negative nutritional value.  My BIL and DH both had the Sourdough Burgers and they both truly enjoyed it.  It's this kinds of Pub food that you come in to this place for....and the beer, I guess.",

We got the fried artichokes and stuffed mushrooms as appetizers, which were very good. Then we split the calzone for two and promised ourselves we'd pace ourselves and take some home. But it was too good and we ended up finishing it. Our server was pleasant and attentive.  I have gone back roughly once a month and sit in the bar area killing time until my husband gets off work. The staff never minds and I usually have fun chatting with them on their slower nights. I prefer this location to the one at Park West in Peoria.

When we walked into the restaurant we waited at the counter for someone to seat us, but there was nobody there. I looked over to the bar where I saw a group of servers just hanging out and talking to each other. About 5 minutes pass and one of the waiters comes up to us and tells us to seat ourselves, which I thought was odd. We picked a booth towards the back of the restaurant and waited 10 minutes for someone to come and give us menus and silverware. I actually ended up having to walk behind their front counter to get our menus, which was a bit ridiculous. About 10 more minutes passed before someone (I think it was the manager) approached our table, greeted us, and said \"I hope you guys haven't been waiting long!\" When I told her we had, all she said was \"Well....we didn't know you were here.\" The food itself was a bit less than average. I ordered the spaghetti and meatballs and the meatballs were pretty mushy and the bread was stale. The ONLY reason I'm giving them 2 stars instead of 1 was because I felt that our waitress was  polite and attentive (that is...after the staff realized we were there).",

Honestly, it is hard to go wrong ordering anything off of the menu, but there are a few things which I highly recommend: the avacado rolls (warm, fried, slightly spicy, and a little messy), tortilla soup, ANY of the beers, the flat bread pizza, any of the burgers, ribs, french dip, and the pastas.  This place is huge, so I have never had to wait long for a table. I would advise making a reservation ahead of time to skip the line (if there is one). It is also located close to the mall, so this place is a good stop for lunch or dinner (or both)! Great for groups and company outings.  There is outside seating which is very pleasant throughout most of the year in AZ. Try the Red or the Porter as those are my favorites!",

I was torn between the Chicken Wings and the Jalepeno Burger, I went with the waiters recommendation and went with the burger. It was excellent.        As an appetizer we ordered Chips and Roasted Salsa, which again was excellent.  The only problem was I had to ask to get them after about 20 minutes.  I informed the waiter when I ordered them, I wanted them as an appetizer.  After seeing a couple tables get appetizers that were seated well after my wife and I showed, I mentioned them again.  Maybe they had to make salsa anew.      The meals came out and whatever my wife ordered, some kind of Parmesan Crusted Chicken was to die for.  When she went to the Northern location she ordered the same thing and she said that it had more sauce with a side of sauce as well, some cheese sauce.  When hers initially came out, one chicken had no sauce and other had very little, so she had to ask for extra sauce.  At the same time I asked for Ketchup for my fries.  My wife got her sauce and about 10 minutes later when I had 4 fries left.  I received my Ketchup.        The review here is, the food was quite good, a hiccup here or there I can handle but the waiter, left a lot to be desired.        I would have given them a 5 if I had a different waiter.",

    "text": "There are a lot of bar and grill restaurants, so what makes BJ's stand out?  Service: The hostesses and servers are always friendly and willing to answer questions about the extensive menu. They always make me feel like a welcome guest.  Beer: They brew their own beer, and each type I have tried has been pretty good. They also have a respectable selection of other beers, as well as wines and cocktails.  Food: I am always impressed at how consistently good the menu items are. They serve lots of different types of food, and I have yet to find a weak link. The jambalaya I had yesterday was extremely delicious. It had meat or vegetable in every bite, and it was large enough for me to spread over lunch and dinner. Other hits include the calzones, pizza, burgers, pasta, and sandwiches.  They seem to be everywhere nowadays, but don't miss BJ's assortment of Pizookies. Get the original, or indulge yourself with the triple chocolate.  Ambiance: It is a large dining room with a high ceiling, so it's never that loud. The decor is modern and classy, making it a suitable place for just about any occasion.  Value: The portion sizes range from large to huge. Lunch specials start at $6, and regular prices are very fair.  This location is right next to the Harkins movie theater, and it makes a great place to stop after seeing a flick.",

But I am leaving this review mostly because I was so blown away by the customer service.... from the hostess, the server, the manager and even the bus boy! Everyone was incredibly kind and went out of their way to accommodate us in having a pleasant experience. Well done guys, THANK YOU!!!",

    "text": "The service I received on 4 Sept last Friday at this location (Chandler) was unimpressive. I was even more disappointed in their management.  My wife and I made a reservation the morning (11:00 AM) of 4 Sept (Friday) for 16+ people for dinner later that night at 7:00 PM.  The host (male) confirmed the reservation (via phone) but when my family along with our friends arrived there later that night, they told us to take a pager and would seat us as soon as possible.  When I inquired as to what had happened, the hostess simply stated that somehow our reservation had gotten deleted in the system and when it was put back into the system, the morning shift entered it incorrectly (6:00 PM).  The server then stated that the current wait was 50 minutes.  I asked to speak to a manager to resolve the issue (as I had 16 individuals w/ their families waiting) and when the manager spoke to us he was less than empathetic in what had happened.  His demeanor was less than encouraging, no apology was given, and he stated he was working the issue but we would have to wait.  There was no sense of urgency to remedy the situation from management and I got the perception that there was very little interest in correcting the error.  Looking around the restaurant, I could easily see that there were vacant tables on the patio (which the manager could have easily offered) regardless if the service would be slow. But no offer was made.  Instead, he stated that we would have to wait the current wait time (50 minutes).    Having a wife who has been in the hospitality management industry for 10+ years, there could have been multiple ways of recovering the situation: Offered patio seating, or at least somewhere to sit, offered some seating at the bar, maybe a few complimentary appetizers to calm the hungry children, or even some waters at least while waiting in the Arizona heat, vouchers or anything to come back another time... at the VERY least, a sincere apology (especially with a party as large as 16+ individuals).  My True disappointment was not that a mistake had happened, but rather how the situation was poorly handled.  We can understand there can sometimes be a miscommunication during a shift change, but poor management and recovery should not be accepted. After talking to the less than empathetic manager, my family and party left BJs and went to the Keg where they were glad to have our business. Sadly, that's $700 in sales BJ's lost out on and also grat that their servers missed out on and more importantly, a loss in some loyal patrons. The great thing about all this is- we have found a new meeting place as our regular dinner location, thanks to the Keg. We will look forward to returning there for our regular dinner outings and will look back and laugh at myself and think what a fortunate mistake this was.   I would suggest a bit more training for the staff, not just for the hostess stand employees, but for leadership/management more importantly. Staff is only as good as their leader.

It took the server a good five minutes to acknowledge me and then another five minutes just to bring me my iced tea. During the course of my meal, my glass was empty several times and she had to walk right by my table to get to the kitchen, so I'm not sure why she couldn't refill my glass on one of her many trips or while she was just standing around. Also, she never stopped to check on how my meal was or if the food was alright. Then when I went to pay, I gave her my rewards card and she didn't even bother to give me the points from today's visit. Also, the manager was too busy watching the baseball game on TV to pay any attention to his servers or guests. I'm just very disappointed with this visit.",

    "text": "Came here of my Birthday dinner with my girlfriend. I haven't been here since probably they opened way back in the day. It is one of my girlfriends favorite places and after the first place we were going to go to was full of obnoxious drunk people I decided we should come over here after hearing her talk about it. It turned out to be a great decision. There was a 20 minute wait when we arrived but that was not a big deal and not to bad for a Saturday night at a place at a mall. We put in our name and we were given a buzzer so we waited. The hostess even used my name when we came back in when the buzzer went off. Not a big deal but a nice touch. Most places ask for a name and never use it. The place was pretty busy but still not too loud. We got a nice booth and started to look over the menu. They had a lot of stuff that looked good. My girlfriend advised against any pasta dishes as she felt they didn't measure up. Of course she is part Italian so she is going to be a touch critic on Italian dishes. I saw the double cheese burger and my eyes lit up. Can't pass that up. Well it turned out to be a good and bad thing. That burger was HUGE but so good. Big patties, bacon, cheese and everything else. Cooked just how I wanted it. Very good. As got the spicy potato wedges, another tip from the girlfriend, they were delicious. Good thing I was hungry from swimming most of the day but I still couldn't quite finish it. Also I was saving some room for a Pizookie. Which I had never had and my girlfriend never goes to BJs without getting one. I ordered the triple chocolate one and even though there was a little bit of a wait for it, they don't make it until you order it, it was so worth the wait. So ooey and gooey and good. I will definitely be having one too every time we come back here. Overall, I really liked this place. Maybe won't get such a huge burger next time but I will be back. I also really like their in house beer. I had the Scottish ale and it was really good. I would like to try more of their different beers next time. There will definitely be a next time. This was a great Birthday dinner capping off a great day.",

We got seated outside to take advantage of the great weather and I was pleasantly surprised by attentive and prompt service.  We chatted for a while before ordering and got some great suggestions from our server.  I've been craving a burger in the worst way.  I only have a couple a year and expect a lot from them.  BJ's burger came with parmesan toasted buns, tomato, pickles, lettuce, bacon, cheese, and a really delicious homemade.1000-Island dressing!  The meat was hi-quality and perfectly cooked..  It came with some yummy wedge fries.....I cleaned my plate!  My friend had a wedge salad and a bread bowl with clam chowder.  She loved every bite!  I was pretty stuffed but she talked me into sharing a trio of pizzookies with ice cream.  They were delicious too, especially the peanut butter with vanilla.  I was impressed overall and will be back.  I think the folks who have rated this place negatively should try it again.  It's worth it!",

    "text": "Had a large party celebrating two birthdays and made a reservation a few days ahead of time with a manager. Called in again to extend my party number and a different manager said I wasn't even put down for a reservation. I'm glad I called or else my party and I would've shown up with no table. When we arrived, we had to wait 25 min even though it was late night on a weekday (it was not busy). During our meal, we were checked on once which is unfortunate because I drink a lot of water and need refills semi-frequently. None of this bothered me until two of my guests had to leave early so they got their check, left cash on the table, and left. Our waitress Laura threw a little fit about how much they did or did not tip. Even though the rest of us tipped normally, her attitude made us all reflect on whether we wanted to tip well or not. She proceeded to drop our cards down on the table for us to go through since she was annoyed. We wanted to put in an additional desert order to make her some more money and she was annoyed because she had already taken an order for us. She forgot to grab my card I was holding up so she was annoyed that she had to come back for it but I mean I don't have to pay if you don't want me to right? In the end, we had to talk to a manager about what is appropriate behavior and conversation to be having in front of customers.",

I feel like one of the downsides is that their menu is like a novel.  I mean my gosh, make a decision here...what kind of food do we want to serve?  I don't want to read through a Cheesecake Factory sized menu when I just want to get a beer and good eats. It's not bad food, it's pretty good - nothing above and beyond but also nothing to write home about.  I have tried the Grilled Chicken Pasta which was just okay.  The second time I went I had the Balsamic Glazed Chicken which was actually pretty delicious.   I haven't gone too much into the beer menu as I'm not a huge beer drinker, but the list is actually pretty big.  Service was great both times, servers were always very friendly and the place was clean.    I'm sure I'll be back here at some point, occasionally it's comforting to know exactly what you're getting in to rather than the unknown. :)",

I don't remember a time I was able to relax and enjoy a meal here. On several occasions our server made us feel like we should have been grateful she was serving us.  Most of them have some sort of off-putting attitude as if they'd rather not be there serving guests.  Used to come frequently, even had the app but can't be bothered any more.  Restrooms can get really gross looks like no one cares. Luckily the area has no shortage of better places that make sure customers have time to enjoy their meals and drinks.",

Thank you Crystal for your incredible personality! You are a jewel!! Good luck with your fantasy football!! We had the full rack of ribs with the root beer glaze with white cheddar mashed potatoes....perfection!! However, the only downside to our wonderful dining experience was your hostess staff. We entered the restaurant and waited for almost a minute before Tyler even looked up and acknowledged us. Really? You don't even make eye contact with someone who comes in the door 6 feet away from you? I find that totally unacceptable. We were seated near the entrance and I had a perfect view of Bailey and Tyler as they seated people and dealt with those patrons who were leaving. Not once did they say goodbye to departing guests. They were too busy chatting with one another. Being in the customer service industry, I find this behavior and actions completely unacceptable. Those two, Bailey and Tyler, certainly make it easy to decide not to come back. Watch who you place as ambassadors to your fine establishment.....",

This time around my deep dish pizza came out on a plate, not in the pan, and the bottom was completely mutilated. Once again I was brought nothing to separate the pizza so my fork and butter knife had to suffice. We ordered a pizookie trio, and they brought out the wrong flavor. I told our waiter, (who was awesome by the way) and he brought out another one right away. Which yet again was the incorrect flavor. The manager on duty came by our table to ask about our experience and I told her what happened. She proceeded to attempt to argue with me about what flavor the second pizookie was then quickly walked away and came back with our check. They ended up comping our meal because they goofed up. The first time we came to this location we had a similar experience. Awesome server yet again, but the kitchen staff just couldn't get it right. The food runners brought our food to the wrong table both times, and failed to bring anything to but the pizza with. The first time around we waited an extremely long time for our food to arrive and the restaurant was completely dead. On all three occasions we came it seemed like our servers were the only ones doing anything. The food runners and bus boys stood around gossiping and twiddling their thumbs. Not impressed at all.",

    "text": "I don't know what I was thinking BJ's was, but not what it is. I thought it was a run-of-the-mill steakhouse, and it's more of a run-of-the-mill brewery. Does this make a difference, you might ask - and yes it does.   So, as this will not become a stable of mine, my visit did make me want to come back in the right mindset and the right company. Plowing through brews and sliders - yeah, I can see that happen.  OK, so the service is standard, and the food seems very basic and the brews are a bit interesting.. but I did notice that besides having quite a few Pale Ale's and IPA's, every other ale is pronounced to be 'hoppy'. What if I don't want a hoppy beer, nor want the token lager that is the stand-in for the go-to Bud/Miller/Corrs/30for$20 kinds of beer. I guess my options are limited, but I will need to plow through them all before I conclude that BJ's might oversell their product just a bit.  I started with the Jeremiah Red, and wasn't blown away. I'd ask more of a Red Ale, and this was way middle of the road. Also very hoppy, even if it suggests being 'Not too hoppy in order to emphasize the complex malt flavor and fruity aroma'. I do not concur - I think its was too hoppy for a Red Ale. I will have to go hard next time to evaluate their brews. I have a feeling that I will not be all too impressed - but then again I will try to remain unbiased.   So where does this leave me? Nah, it's all right I guess.. and I will come back when the time is right.",

To put it another way I wouldn't tell someone they had to go out of their way to try it but if they're in the area and were looking for a decent place to eat I would definitely recommend it. My wife had the avocado bacon and cheese sandwich. She enjoyed it I tried a bite myself and thought it was good too. I ordered the black and blue burger. The flavor was good and the portions were exactly what you'd expect at a place like that. All in all a great experience and a great place to check out if you're in the area.",

    "text": "Great beer made on site, and some unique deep dish pizzas make for a great happy hour and reverse happy hour.   Despite the recent rise in the price of the mini pizzas the half off deal at happy hour is hard to beat. The deals on the beer are not the best, but they quality makes up for it.   I really like the spinach artichoke pizza, Imagine taking a pizza and using a creamy artichoke spinach dip in lieu of tomato sauce. That is one rich deep dish pizza. Couple with a tatonka stout and it is one great meal to indulge in.   Some of their other great beers are the Jeremiah red. As the name implies it is a red Irish beer. Usually there is a Belgium seasonal high gravity beer whose flavor and alcoholic punch is are to beat.  For happy hour beers are $1 off mini pizzas are 1/2 off and most appetizers are $2 off. There is some deal on well drinks, but then why come to a brewery to drink anything other than beer?    If you find your self feeling the effects of the beer too quickly the potato wedge fires make for a great sponge to soak up some of the happy juice in the beer.  Don't forget you can get a growler (1/2 gallon) of beer to go!",

The first thing I would like to point out is that on the website where you can add \"Special Instructions\" is pointless because clearly the cooks or chefs do not follow it! I specifically typed \"No Cheese on the pasta and salad\" but the salad definitely had cheese on it. Then the next thing that is absurd is the the fact that the \"Special Instructions\" has a limit of 25 characters including spaces so it's difficult to express what you'd like to change or mention about the selected dish. Next, on the website that is ridiculous is when you have to select the time in which you will be picking up the order. Well, our order was suppose to be ready 8:30, so if that's the selected time then it should be ready by then. Now, I know some restaurants get behind on orders, but we had to wait an additional what felt like 20 minutes. On top off the inconvenient website (where none of the employees pay attention to the time of pick-up and special instructions), and long wait time, they got got the order wrong! We ordered no cheese on the Caesar Salad, and chocolate ice cream with our Pizookies and got vanilla ice cream instead. Oh, and I wanted chocolate chips and didn't get it at all! But I guess it's my fault for putting it in \"Special Instructions\". For the amount of money I spent I would hope to get what I paid for! #UnsatisfiedCustomer #Ishouldgetmymoneyback #Whyorderonlineifyoustillhavetowait #ChocolateLovergonMAD #NOcharacterLIMITS",

Our bartender/waitress Tracy was fantastic. She was very efficient, friendly and helpful.   The fries were crispy and abundant enough for two of us to share. We both enjoyed them. My spouse had the crispy chicken sandwich which was supposed to come with honey mustard sauce but the kitchen forgot the sauce but Tracy got it quickly when we told her it was missing. My husband liked his sandwich.  They offered free pizzokies (baked cookies or brownies in a deep dish pizza pan). It was delicious and came warm with a large scoop of ice cream. I didn't eat the ice cream but the cookie was really moist yet crispy on the outside.   Tracy was generous with the drinks as well. I had one vodka with club soda and definitely had more vodka than club soda. My husband had two lagers.  Overall it was pleasantly good. Not a lot of healthy choices and they're short on staff (lots of tables needed to be cleaned and not enough wait staff for the dining area) but perfect for what we were looking for that evening.",

It seemed we were a complication for them from the moment we arrived.    Food was largely satisfactory but the prime rib was not 'prime'. A lot of gristle and too fatty. The edible parts were tasty.   After 3 hours in our own good company and a long wait for our order we had to find someone to run our bill so we could go.  I dislike leaving unfavorable reviews and and will note the atmosphere is comfortable and wait staff was very kind.    Management discounted our meal without prompting. While that was appreciated we did not set out this evening for a discount dining experience.  BJ's is probably fine for standard tavern fare; but a chop house it is not. Suggest steering clear of complicated 'signature' dishes and stick to regular grill menu.",

We had reservations at the Ivy for 2 pm and arrived there to find out the kitchen was closed and the restaurant was closing at 3 pm. We were shocked and pissed. I won't go into more detail, I posted on ivy site, you can read it there.  I called BJ's from ivy's parking lot and they were happy to accommodate us. We arrived and were seated within 10 minutes.  Our server was great, we all had a wonderful meal. Two order of ribs, one burger, one salad, one rib eye and one kids meal. We were all stuffed and happy. It wasn't my first time at BJ's, I like this place. I now LOVE BJ's!!  THANK YOU BJ's you saved our Easter dinner!!!!  We will be back again!!",

    "text": "The food and drinks were delicious, our waitress was awesome and we didn't spend all day waiting. It was a nice change because many breweries that I've been to don't offer good ciders, just mainly a sour IPA here and there. I haven't grown to the taste of any beers yet, so I loved the berry blast cider that was here. Definitely good change of pace. The salmon dinner was delicious but I believe it was over priced for the portion. My husband got the brisket burger and it looked delicious. I think it was fairly priced. For my husband, daughter and myself to eat it was $100. The kids meal is only $6.50.. we each had 1 drink with our meal so it's definitely a more expensive option than anticipated. I did get a 64OZ growler when we were getting ready to go, but that was $16 and cheaper than either meal! Insane. But it wasn't a bad place. Just over priced.",

    "text": "As a former server I can't stand rating a restaurant 1 star because I loving giving the benefit of the doubt. The problem is that every single time I've walked in this restaurant the service is slow and lackluster at best. I've never found myself saying \"let's go to BJ's\" and have always walked in out of convenience. Tonight was the exact scenario. We walked in the door (3 adults and 1 toddler) to be seated. Immediately behind us a table of 6 adults and a child walked in. We all stood at the hostess area while servers walked by and bartenders looked over. After about 3-4 minutes and comments if anyone was coming over the person who I assume to be the shift manager walked over and greeted us as two individual parties. She stated that she'd get us a table. The hostess walked over and was asked to seat us and the manager walked over to get a table set for the 7 top. The hostess fumbled with her computer for about a minute and told us she was going to walk and check where she could seat us with a high chair. From the door I could see at least 10 tables that were near other tables. As a former server I'm familiar with closed stations but it was obvious this wasn't the case. The hostess was gone long enough for the manager to walk away and ready the other table with settings. A second hostess then walked to the front and we were greeted by a server as she approached. The server was the nicest of the group. She asked if she could help us but we explained we were waiting for the other hostess to return. The server turned to hostess #2 and asked her if she was helping us to which she responded \"I'm cut but I guess I can help\". She began to look over the computer. We've now been in the place almost 10 minutes and the manager returns to set the other larger table. The first hostess returned and informed us she was still trying to find us a table and that we would have to wait longer. I explained that it was the strange encounter at best and that we would be leaving and not returning. No one made effort to address us or ask us to stay. We went to a neighboring restaurant and were promptly greeted and sat immediately. I began to type this as soon as my order was placed and my meal was just delivered. My family and I will not be returning again.",

Each time we went, our server (all different people) seemed to keep forgetting about us. By the time we got our food, it was somewhat warm as if it had been waiting before it got to us, and it wasn't as great as it has been at other locations.   One night, my husband & I came for a date (giving it another try). The hostess made us carry our own menus and utensils and told us to sit anywhere. For anyone else who came in after us, she carried their menus and utensils and walked them in to seat them. Now, race doesn't mean a thing to me. And I'm not usually one to think like this. But my husband and I started wondering if it had anything to do with us not being white like our hostess, server, and the families who entered after us were. Again, I hate that the thought of that even had to cross our minds. But, bottom line, we haven't been treated fairly here.",

Third time was terrible again.  I didn't even bother calling the manager.  It seems that they are hiring staff with attitudes and don't care about customer service and customer needs.  I liked that they are open til midnight with many options on the menu but I'm not going to waste my money and energy at a place that don't have good service.  Luckily there are many other options in the area with much better service and much nicer staff.",

She was very short and almost rude to each in the group. We had to ask her multiple time for more cocktails, water and such. We even waited for a couple of minutes to get silverware napkins and condiments after our food was brought to the table. Nothing was a priority to her. Four of us are self-employed business owners and the 5th person is a restaurant manager. None of us could believe that management has re-trained her or let her on her way out the door.

But much like the Cheesecake Factory, everything on the menu is not great. In my opinion, the pizzas and pasta dishes leave much to be desired. The sandwiches, soups, burgers, salads, and appetizers are very yummy. My favorite is the clam chowder in a bread bowl. So. Good.  This appears to be a great place for groups.The staff is very accommodating, and attentive, and the restaurant is very big. Friday and Saturday nights are generally packed with people, understandably so with the good food, relaxed atmosphere, and the beer/drink menu. If possible, I would call ahead or be prepared for wait a bit.  As I mentioned before, this place has an extensive beer and alcohol menu. My dad and uncle love this place for the beers, and I love this place for the cocktails. I have not been for happy hour, but I hear it is great.   Definitely A-OK place for lunch/dinner in Chandler.

    "text": "Main Points: -Variety of beer and food -Good portions on dinner menu -Great for groups  Review: If you're looking to grab some food outside of the mall's food court, consider stopping into BJ's. They've got a very extensive menu with various types of cuisines, so it's sure to suit everyone in your group or the individual who just can't decide on one food type that sounds good.   I've tried several things on the menu in the past, and I've thoroughly enjoyed their signature gynormous potatoes, tasty beer, and melt-in-your-mouth pizzookies.  If you're looking for something with a little bit of spice, try their jambalaya - not sure how it fares with authentic cajun cooking, but it hits the spot.  I may have to give the lunch menu another try, but I was a bit disappointed with the things I tried today: Chicken quesadilla- hardly any cheese and not enough food for a lunch, Margherita Flatbread - too small and sauce tasted like the diy luncheable pizzas from elementary school, Turkey bacon ham sandwich - just your regular sandwich nothing special, and their Pale Ale chili - no spice and not a very good overall flavor.  Despite my lunch experience, I'm giving them a 4 because my past meals have been consistently good. I like the variety of food and beer, good service, my fav dishes,and the convenience of the location, and their ability to accommodate groups.",

The food is consistently delicious no matter what you order from their extensive menu. They also offer different/new in-house micro-brews throughout the year. Its always a treat trying their latest concoction! Last, if you have not attended one of BJ's \"Beer Dinners\" you really need to make it a point to do so. During the beer dinners you are served a variety of BJ's delicious foods, usually 4 courses, accompanied by a beer selected to compliment the chosen food and of course, your palate. Again, BJ's in Chandler is by far our favorite go-to place to eat where we visit monthly!",

You are separated into small clusters through out and it doesnt seem as big as the venue is.  As for service, they got our order wrong and forgot to put in the appetizers.. before we even had a chance to get upset, the waiter said it would be compted, apologized several times. The manager came by, apologized several times.. wow. I felt really appreciated and the service was great. They do really value their customers!  As for food: - I got the Scallops - OH MY GOODNNEESS. So good, these are perfection, and in their EnLIGHTened menu. So one of the healthier choices and very filling. - Like always my eyes are too big for my stomach so I also got the chili. This was alright, nothing out of this world.. and it has a lot of sour cream, so if you hate it as much as i do you will spend several minutes just scooping all of it out.  -Appetizer: Stuffed Mushrooms. So good! And fancy.. so great! -My bf got the Hamburger - Now... this is where it all went south. The hamburger was underwhelming, not juicy, not spiced, not anything. It just was a hamburger. Not memorable at all.  Solid 4 stars. And dont get a hamburger!",

Having very fond memories of the amazing tuna poke at Lulu's in Lahaina on Maui, BJ's was in for some steep competition.  They succeeded in a wonderful take on the dish.  The avocado egg rolls made my belly happy as well, and were NOT at all greasy.  Very very good.  Lots of TVs to watch various sporting events.  Lots of fun!",

They have a new expanded menu with new offerings and now offer gluten-free buns for their hamburgers.  The waitress was great, but the highlight was when the manager, David, came over to help us with the new BJ's app.  We had trouble logging in  and the manager took the time to help us and then when we still could not log-in, he offered to give our contact information to his tech guru at headquarters.  David was very personable and you could tell by talking to him that he took a lot of pride in his restaurant and was very loyal to the company.  We finished off our meal with a delicious gluten-free pizzookie, which the whole family enjoyed.",

We were down in the Awatukee/Chandler area doing some shopping at Ikea, and decided we needed something to eat stat.  We didn't feel like driving very far, so we circled through the mall to see what we could find.  We decided on BJ's as none of us had been there before and the menu looked really good from the outside. Its a beer brewery, but seems to have a really good menu of food items when eating here.  We got seated right away and our server was a real nice gal who answered all our questions.  I went with the roast beef sandwich Au jus.  It came with white horseradish and was delicious!  My mom went with the tomato bisque soup and ceaser salad, and my friend Austin ate the bacon cheeseburger with some fries.  OMG food was so good!  Water and beverages were filled quickly without being asked, and everyone here was happy.  I would love to come here and drink, as they have an awesome drink menu, but since I was driving everyone all over town AND we were with my mom, I guess I'm going to have to come back another time and get my adult beverage on here!  I will say, the only negative thing I have to say about this place was that it was freezing inside! It was so cold that my mom had to go outside to warm up.  It was quite cold, but I was able to stick it out, but when my mom was outside warming up, so befriended another customer who was outside trying to warm up too!",

The 10 steps of service is something they're not familiar with.   Today we visited from 2:45p-4:15p. Luckily we gave the server the entire order during the drink order. Otherwise, we would've been here longer.  That being said, our server never did any table checks we literally had to wave him down to get anything else. On top of that he maybe came to actually check on us 2 times in the 2 hours we dined.   Whoever runs this place needs to get replaced. Most times we encounter new servers they don't seem confident in their training and even if they seem to be seasoned servers, table checks are nonexistent.",

This location is in a newer mall and is not a freestanding location, but is adjacent other shops in a large spread out retail area near the 101 and 202 in Chandler.  There is outdoor seating with misters, but no one was that crazy for the 100+ temps after 7pm.  We used the app to get on the wait list and were seated within 10 minutes of arrival.  They were very busy and it is a very large location.  Our hostess was awesome and very engaging so we had a lot of fun with her even when we had problems.  First she forgot our utensils but no worries, then my wife's food order was prepared wrong and the Ahi was very dry (freezer burn or left out?) She addressed all our issues quickly with apologies and understanding.  We had a new order quickly and the manager came to check on us as well.  We did not ask for any discounts due to our issues being quickly and nicely address but they removed her item and honored my discount which I had from my app.    Very positive experience, we will come back to this mall to see the museum and Crayola experience as we had not been here and only came for the food.  Lots of shops.   I don't usually give chains more than a 4, but our experience with the issues, were handled well and professionally.",

We so enjoy requesting to be seated in her section and luckily she is almost always our server. It's the menu food and service from all that keeps us coming back over and over again!   Jeanne & David the GM's are an absolute asset to this restaurant and to the company. They train their staff well. Anytime you ask to sub, replace, extras or more- it's aways accommodated. Never questioned or told no- ever!   The food is always delicious and the beer is great. Unbeatable Happy Hour Deals during the week too! It's our first choice so often to choose to dine at Bj's because of the professionalism and quality of the food & everything I've listed above.  Ps- Brittany needs another employee star for her outstanding service , that girl stands out a mile! :)",

I had heard wonderful things about the Pizookie so I thought I would give it a try.  It was delicious!  I had looked at the menu and really wanted the deep dish pizza but I was full.  A couple of days later I was still craving the pizza.  So I stopped by again afterwork to satisfy my craving for pizza.  It's now become a frequent afterwork restaurant.  They have a great happy hour menu (in the bar only).  I've always received great service.  My favorite server is Cat.  She is wonderful!  Not only does she remember me but I have noticed that she remembers her other customers as well.  How servers interact with their regular customer mean a lot to me.",

I'm giving 2 stars and if the service wasn't so terrible I'd give more because the food is good.  1st time I went I was greeted and sat by hostess (on the patio). A server never came out for at least 10 minutes. This is unacceptable in the middle of summer in AZ. Water should have been brought by a server or hostess. The service from there continued to be so. Un-attentive to say the least. I mentioned to what I thought was management and a mere apology was given.   Gave another chance yesterday. Server took order without writing anything down. Of course when we got our food, the order was wrong. When we addressed her, she attempted to blame my sister. We were never checked on the entire time. Our waters continued to stay empty. I was at least smart enough to sit inside this time. She seemed very attentive to her to other tables and it was mid day on a Thursday, so not a busy time at all. When she finally did check on us, I just said we were ready for our check. She handed it right over. It was the only one in her apron. What if we were going to order more. Just seemed like she was in a hurry to get us out of there. I'm huge on customer service, as much as I like good food, I pay a premium when going out to have good service and this place just doesn't fit the mold...unfortunately.",

Service last night was not the best. Our waiter forgot about us a few times throughout the night, and I watched another waiter tell him to check on us before he was once again going to go into the kitchen without checking on us. We ordered two side salads before our entrees and I must say they were a sad excuse for a salad. Iceberg lettuce, a few carrots and watery ranch. Yuck. I ate a little and decided to wait it out for my entree.  I ordered a mini bacon cheeseburger pizza and my fiance had the jalapeno pepper jack burger. The first few bites of my pizza were pretty tasty, it had a combination of cheddar cheese, dill pickles, ground beef, bacon and a special sauce. I had eaten it before on a previous visit and really liked it. After the first few bites the pizza seemed very doughy and not cooked all the way through. I might have sent it back but service was quite slow and I did not feel like waiting another thirty minutes. My fiance's jalapeno burger was okay. It was not bad but not great. The fries were very tasty.  We did finish off our meal with a chocolate chip pizookie. That is the saving grace to the whole meal. Warm cookie with ice cream mmmmm.....   I might be back if it is a late night and I am coming out of a movie. I don't think that I would get to adventurous with the menu. I would stick to beer, apps and a pizookie.",

    "text": "One of the WORST EXPERIENCES EVER.   1. Ordered the cajun pasta but the flavor did not taste Cajun. I had it once before and it was very good. It took a while but I was finally able to wave down the waitress and asked her if there was any way to make it more \"Cajuny\". It came back smelling like dirty sink water & it tasted like straight up salt along with a hint of the dirty sink water, making it completely inedible.   2. My boyfriend asked for extra toasted buns on his crispy jalapeno burger and it came out very soft and un-toasted.. Their excuse for that was that they toasted the underside of the buns more than usual.. what kind of logic is that? The underside of the bun just gets soggy anyway because of the sauce so isn't it obvious if someone stresses the fact that they need the buns extra toasted they would do both sides of the buns?  3. We were unable to get even one refill due to the extremely long absences of the waitress and my boyfriend even yelled for her when she was 3 feet away and she still wouldn't turn around... and the restaurant wasn't even loud, the table next to where our waitress was standing even looked at my boyfriend because he was calling for her. The experience was more of a hassle than anything. For the hour we spent at here, 30 minutes was spent looking around waiting for the waitress to bring us the check and togo boxes. After the 15 minutes past of waiting for the check my boyfriend kept urging me to walk out on the check with him because he felt like they didn't deserve our money but I waited another 15 minutes to pay for this horrible experience... Since when did it take 30 minutes to get a check and togo boxes?   Worst of all, it was an extremely slow night, slow enough to see plenty of waiters sitting around and talking for 20 mins. Luckily our waitress took the pasta off of our check so we didn't have to pay for the extremely salty, dirty, sink water flavored pasta.  Now that I think about it, I should've listened to my boyfriend. This experience, along with 1 burger and 2 appetizers was not at all worth $27. No wonder they call themselves BJ's cuz this place BLOWS!",

    "text": "BJs was a place that my husband and I frequently would visit, mainly due to the late hours they have. We routinely pick up food from here and have given this restaurant multiple chances after they CONSTANTLY mess up our orders and finally, enough is enough, and I can't see a time when we're coming back. Back on Veternan's Day my husband and I picked up food to go; my order was severely messed up (missing toppings, wrong side), and I called the restaurant to let them know. The worker was apologetic and said we would get refunded; I gave our card number that it was purchased on and three weeks later, still no refund. Obviously, refunds don't take that long so we went back into the restaurant to ask about the refund. While we waited for a manager, one of the chefs came out and discussed how \"crazy\" the restaurant was and busy on Veteran's Day, and they messed up a lot of orders. I chuckled inside because I was thinking, first of all, a restaurant should be prepared to deal with demand, secondly; you mess up our orders all the time. Eventually, the manager came out who really seems to be like a nice guy; we have talked to him several times due to the multiple times our orders are botched. He offered us either our money back or a $25 gift card, so we accepted the gift card and left. Later, we wanted to grab dinner, so I ordered food from BJ's on their application. I ordered a sandwich and a turkey burger and within minutes my cell phone rang, it was BJs saying the order had come through as a large pizza and that the cooks in the back thought it was odd that a pizza had mayo on it, so they figured something had happened. What was confusing is the fact that they assumed it was a pizza, but they said all the customizations we added to our order were visible. My husband made sure they could see all of our customizations, asked about them, and they said they had the order correct, and it would be ready for pick-up shortly. When my husband went to pick up our order, after being in there for 20 minutes or so, he saw the turkey burger had a side salad with it. He questioned the worker saying that wasn't right, and she argued that the turkey burger comes with a side salad WITHOUT dressing. He said I know, but my wife changed her side to fries (why would you argue and what is the point of customizing an order if they can't get it right?). My husband then was obviously skeptical that the rest of the order was right, and he asked if the turkey burger had onions on it (I love onions and previously when I ordered the turkey burger they left onions off, which is stupid because one of the toppings it comes with IS onions), the worker replied that onions were on it because it comes on it. Well, thankfully my hubby is smart or just knows how bad they are, so he asked for some onions on the side. Anyway, we get home; I go to look at the toppings on my turkey burger and sure enough -- no onions. I could go on and on about all the times that they have messed up our order, and even though we had a gift card, we still paid too much for service and food like this. One other example, one time we placed a take-out order and ordered a specific pizookie - the restaurant wasn't able to see what flavor pizookie we wanted, and what flavors of ice cream, so instead of calling us, they gave us whatever they wanted (are you kidding? Prices are way too high for this kind of service). We are very loyal customers, and we won't be coming back anytime soon. Something with the way this restaurant runs is severely broken and obviously nothing is fixing it. The sad part is this was our first time being back since they messed up our previous order, and here they go again getting it wrong. It is sad that places like McDonald's mess up my order a lot less than a place that is much more expensive.",

So my sisters boyfriend took me to this mall and he said we need to stop here first. I was like well ok I guess, and man oh man am I glad we did. It made shopping so amazing (I hate to go shopping during this time period as should anyone) it quickly became my favorite way to shop... slightly drunk! :)  So as amazing as the shopping experience was I was very glad to have had a chance to discover one of my favorite beers Tatonka Stout.",

The food I've had has been really good: flat bread pizzas, spring rolls, lettuce wraps, burgers, and best of all, their pizookie. All of it is great every time. Tuesdays are definitely the days to go; $2 BJ's pints from 10 to close. You'd think the selection of brews to have on special is too narrow, but they've got a beer for anyone. My favorites so far have been the Jeremiah Red (pretty strong Irish red ale), the Nit Wit (Belgian spiced ale), Big Fish (a pale ale stronger than the Piranha pale ale), and the Grand Cru (10% Beligian!). The servers we've had over the past couple years have all been great and really friendly. Totally worth it, if only for the Tuesdays.",

Just about EVERY time we order, one or more of the following is inevitable; there is food missing, we are over charged, the person taking the order doesn't have a clue what they have on their menu, it takes an unreasonable time to get delivered (usually because the driver gets lost) and the \"delivery charge\" amount is excessive. The past few times have just been ridiculous. In fact, the last time we ordered, we had every one of the aforementioned go wrong. We were charged separately for every single thing that should've been included in our meals, (fries, salads, soups, etc.), the delivery gal headed the opposite direction of our location and took over an hour and a half to get here. The food was nasty, cold, rubbery and some things were missing. I don't know how the dine-in service and food is around lunchtime, but I can assure you that they need to do some serious adjustments to their take out/delivery! Just because we are eating take out, doesn't make our order, service or food less important. GET IT TOGETHER, FOLKS!!",

It was cold and refreshing and divine! Hubby got the California burger and said it was ok. All in all, a decent place but was a bit pricey. 12.00 for my salad and 10.00 for his burger that wasn't very big. Strawberry lemonade was ok but Chili's has better. Pizookie was good but they are easy to make at home, not worth it to pay for one here. Service was good although my avocado was initially left off my salad. Would I go back? Yes I would but not often since its kinda pricey for what it is. Would get the salad again, maybe try their pizza, and some of their brews.",

    "text": "BJs is hit and miss...I've had good food there, and I've had mediocre food there. I've never had a \"great\" meal, but that's not really what you're paying for or should expect.   Everything is pretty ordinary, salads and appetizers are alright, entrees are alright. Service and environment is good typically, and they have some really good beers and good specialty items. Their draft root beer is amazing, and I would end every meal with a BJs pazookie if doing so meant I wouldn't drop dead from heart failure at 35. I like their burgers pretty well, but they took their classic burger off the menu, which was a bummer. It was really good, so that's too bad.   It's a good place to watch a game or to grab a bite if you're in Chandler, but it's never going to wow you. I'm sure I'll be back soon enough, because it's a solid, reliable place to get a pretty good meal.",

I like that. Chicago style pizza awesomeness! OMG.. one slice fills you up. the pizza is on the rich side so not the kind of pizza you eat often but a great place to treat yourself. looking forward to trying the beer and thin crust pizza...btw, they brew their own beer.",

    "text": "We had a mixed experience here today.  I'll start with the positive:  The appetizer platter we got was very good and the kids LOVED the mozzarella sticks.  The adults enjoyed the avocado spring rolls, the other kind of spring rolls (not sure what they were called), and the artichoke dip with chips. The beers we selected were also good.  I loved mine, but once again I can't remember the name (it was the one our waitress said was the closest to a blue moon beer).  Lastly their thin and crispy fries were wonderful!   Ok, so now for the bad:  The men in our group ordered some kind of chicken tacos and the other ordered a personal size pizza...both were TINY portions.  I was not thrilled with the so called sourdough bread that my California chicken sandwich was on...the bread tasted a little burnt.  The worst thing about this meal was that the waitress announced that they were out of the chocolate chip pazookie dessert for the rest of the evening....WHAT?!  When you have little kids that look forward to this dessert, it is not a good thing when you are told that!  This was a late Saturday afternoon...how do you not have plenty of those desserts on hand for a SATURDAY NIGHT????  I still enjoyed the white chocolate and macadamian nut mini pazooki that I got and the kids liked the cookies and cream one they tried.  The pazookies at Oreganos are still better in my opinion.... Anyway, not sure if we will be going here again, but maybe we'll try the deep dish pizza next time.",

    "text": "My 2nd time at BJ's was last week. This is a busy business, but has adequate seating between the bar, the huge and beautiful restaurant and outside patio seating. We waited around 15-20 minutes on a busy night, but definitely worth it.  Sometimes you go places and the menu is so small that it's either really easy or really hard to make a decision. Not the case with BJs! The menu is practically a bedtime storybook, which is awesome because you get to decide from a huge array of dishes, but also a pain because you want to eat everything, as in the case of myself! Boyfriend got the buffalo chicken wonton tacos for an app and he enjoyed them. He had the lighter option pork chops and enjoyed those as well. I had a burger and fries and it was very good. Service was good, too!   Another great thing is the dessert menu, which has a lot of good options, especially more than the average restaurant. (I'm not lying! See here: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.bjsrestaurants.com%2Fmenus%2Fdesserts&s=04047e0cfe07fca99b7fec7e628356b26aa0c73a8314f9de96eec129e309cf8a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bjsrestaurants.com/menus...</a>). Opted for the Baked Beignet, but they were out of it, so 2nd choice was the Oreo Cookies N Cream Pizookie! It was suuuuper delicious. I joined their rewards club and always get e-mails for deals, so I suggest signing up, it's worth it! Cannot wait to go back, just wish it was closer to my place!",

The marinara sauce has an extra spicy kick that's both unusual and very tasty.  Would have granted 4 stars if not for the spotty service.

We've been to this location before, last season, and they used to have about 12-16 tv's across their main bar where you could watch multiple games at one time, but today that space had one larger tv and then the sides had the smaller tv's. We arrived around 10:20am to watch the Green Bay Packers that had started at 10am. We politely asked if the one tv on the end could be changed to the Packer game. There were maybe 10-12 people in the bar area, none near the side we'd be sitting near. The tv had women's volleyball I think on it. When we had first arrived the bartender had his back to the bar paying more attention to his cell phone. It's football Sunday and no one cared... so bye bye, you will never see us again. (We left and spent over $60 at Valle Luna on Ray Rd where their service and food was excellent! We called on our way over and they saved us a table in front of a tv with the Packer game on it.)",

Oh man, my girlfriend ordered pasta(forgot the name), it was so undercooked and tasted like it was froze and microwaved.

He was attentive during the meal.  The pub/bar food is actually good, unlike some breweries that have great beer but only mediocre food. I had the double burger loaded with onions, cheese, a house made bun, and a side of onion strings. They cooked the burger medium as requested, and it was well seasoned with the proper amount of juiciness. The onion strings were amazing!  For dessert, their chocolate chip pizookie is the best.

I was promptly greeted by their hostess and escorted to my both. My waitress was there with in minutes and brought our of waters with in minutes. We wornt sure what to get for a appetizer so we asked the waitress what she would recommend. She suggested the avocado spring we went with her suggestion. They were pretty tasty. What ever the sause that they gave you for the dip was amazing. You literally could drink it tasted so good jkkk. My friend ordered there bacon guacamole cheese burger and subbed the french fries for a soup. She really cheeseburger phenomenal. I took a bite of the burger and it was pretty good. I ordered their California club sandwich at the recommendation of the Waitress and sub the Fry's for there Caesar salad. I was surprised at how big the saled was I couldn't even finish it. The sandwich was very good chicken with season  perfectly . Good portions I would only eat half of it. For dessert we ordered there mint Pizookie which was phenomena.  The only done side was we waited forever to get out desert. Waited way longer then we should have. We did not mention this to our server. After out check arrived the Manger came over to apologize abiut how long ir took our desserts out. That was very much appreciated.",

The manager said she would see what else she could do.   When the waiter came by he was amazing. He let me \"create\" a sandwich that was not even on the menu to meet my allergies. It was delicious.  He then came back and told me our whole meal was comped and wished me a happy Mother's Day!  The executed excellent customer service!!",

We also shared a bowl of some of the best broccoli cheese soup around. The service was great. The wait was quick. The most overwhelming part of the visit was choosing what to eat with an array of options. I am definitely looking forward to taking my children or any family that might visit from out of state. UPDATE: Went here for a second time. The service was great. Most of the food was good. AVOID the boneless wings. Unfortunately they are not that great..for as much good food they have here,boneless wings are a no go.",

We were seated promptly and our waiter took our drink order right away.   While our waiter got our food and drinks timely,  he just didn't give the welcoming feeling.   I ordered the Parmesan chicken, mash potatoes and broccoli.  I thought the side salad came with the dinner but it doesn't. Charged $3.50 for it. I'm used to getting a dinner salad with my entre at other places, so I was surprised this wasn't included.   Daughter ordered the chicken and avocado flat bread pizza.  She said the sauce was a little spicy and she picked off the avocados.   The food was cooked well and had plenty of flavor. BJ's had a large menu. From tacos,  burgers, pizza to steaks and pasta.  Something for everyone.",

The worst tasting item was the $20 med pizza. Immagine pizza hut only 10 times worse with only a sprinkle of parmesan cheese. I asked for extra mozzarella. The spinach dip had no flavor and the fried items tasted like grease. I wanted to say something to the manager but I hate causing a scene, especially on my b-day. I ended up paying an $88 bill for a bunch of gross food that the waitress helped us bag up. Very obvious we didn't eat, and left hungry. (this bill did include 1 drink which was very tasty) This experience was bothering me so after I arrived home I called and spoke to the manager. I wanted to give him a rundown of how I felt about the food. I could have went to the Keg and gotten 2 steaks leaving full and satisfied for nearly the same amount of money. The manager was very kind and apologised for the experience. I did affirm that the service was outstanding so I definitely have no complaints there.  The manager offered to mail me a gift card to come back and try the food again, which I accepted. I still have NOT received the gift card in the mail. Very unfortunate experience all around.",

    "text": "The service was absolutely terrible!!! We placed our names on the call ahead list and we got there and the table was ready right away which was great. We sat for about 6 minutes before anyone came up to our table to take our drink order and by that time our table was ready to order. When ordering our appetizers i specifically said we will have the knots to start and my parents stated that they wanted the ribs as an appetizer. I ordered a cocktail and everyone else ordered root beers or water. For some reason my drink came out first and generously first. Everything else took about 4 minutes to get out. When our food order was placed it was the most awkward and painful experience for her to place our order on her tablet. Nothing friendly or smooth about it. So after our order was placed we waited and waited and it took a solid 17-22 minutes to get the food out and as she was bringing out entrees we asked what had happened to the apps. She ran back to check and brought them out with the entrees. She said the ribs take a while and I said I understand that but that's why we ordered them as apps. Shortly after the manager came out and said she was confused when the order was placed all at once and said he was taking care of the apps, which we had a coupon for an app so that wasn't our intent in the first place. My mom wasn't a fan of the Sante fed salad but not because it didn't taste good or anything just simply not her type of salad. The salad was full and pushed to the side and the server didn't ask one question of what was wrong with it or anything. By the time we got the check, I looked it over and the manager had removed a couple of items like he said, but there were two cocktails on the tab when I had only ordered one. So I addressed that with her and it was removed. I just was completely unhappy with my overall experience at this restaurant this time. And i was actually pretty shocked. I have really high expectations so i was very disappointed.",

Kids licked their plates clean and our burgers were outstanding.  Because this is a brewery they make their own root beer and cream soda in house. Best cream soda ever, hands down.

We ordered take-out and wasn't sure what to expect as my 17 year old is always starving and never satisfied with portions...to my surprise BJ's went beyond my expectations. The burger and fries were excellent in flavor and size. My husband ordered the spaghetti with meatballs and they were extra large and tasted like homemade! The twist roll was a delicious surprise as well. I prefer smaller meal portions so I ordered the kids meal: Chicken, broccoli which came with a side salad. The salad alone almost filled me up! The broccoli was perfectly steamed and the chicken was flavorful and juicy. I can't remember the last time I didn't have a dry chicken breast from a restaurant and am usually trepidatious to order BUT I can honestly say we will definitely be eating here more often and I will now start using BJ's to cater my office lunches! So excited for a business/restaurant that has chefs who know how to deliver!!! Bravo BJ's!",

Today I went out with my girlfriend and they were extremely busy again having over an hour wait (popular restaurant). The staff was super friendly and well organized. To make things more convenient the staff was able to send a text message to our phones to inform us when our seats were ready. We had an incredible waitress named Taylor who was SUPER funny and kind. She constantly checked in on us and made sure we were doing well even with all the tables she had to attend. Highly recommend coming to this restaurant. Almost all of the staff here are wonderful, but tonight Taylor really impressed my girlfriend and I because of how positive she was and her attitude when engaging with the people in the restaurant.",

    "text": "BJ's Brewhouse Chandler is located at the mall. We met some friends here for dinner on their suggestion.  Being at the mall during spring break is not my idea of a good time, so there's that. Parking was a nightmare.  Wait time was very short, and the restaurant itself was busy but not too loud.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FThe.menu&s=c396413953bae94ae01fff8ef3d4a8ef93f743abfb4c77e8bcaf702341ba2d21\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">The.menu</a> was great. We started with calamari and salads. The calamari was very salty, but was cooked well, so as not to be rubbery. The Caesar salad was great.  Before the main course,  I ran out of water. Where's the server? Who knows. Eventually I see her and beg for some.  The entrees arrive with perfect timing. Our friends order jumbalaya and the shrimp asparagus penne. I also chose the penne, and my husband the Mahi Mahi with shrimp on couscous. He really enjoyed his meal, as did I.  Then, I ran out of water. I steal my husband's. I run out of his water. I don't see the server until everyone is dine and she offers the dessert menu. I drink my water refill in one second flat.  We're not quite ready for dessert, bit are chatting and randomly glancing at the menu. For all the mad - dogging and dessert preasure, you'd think that I could get a flippin' glass of water!  We eventually order the Pizookie trio, sampling the macadamia nut,  Ghirardelli triple chocolate and the salted caramel. Holy chocolate balls these were good!    And then I ran out of water. She drops the check before the dessert comes. Some other dude brings dessert. She promptly collects the check and we never see her again. I have imbibed everyone's water. The server was nice enough, but seemed more intent on rushing us through, maybe to get off in time? I'm not a pain in the butt, and I've been a server, so I'm polite, not needy, and tip really well, so I don't think watching the beverages of your tables is too much to ask.  And then...the restroom.  Going into the restroom felt like a transporter into a bus station bathroom...in Mexico. It was beyond gross. One stall was locked but appeared empty. A staff member had locked herself in another and was on the phone professing her love to her man in Spanish. That left the hc stall. Feces covering the toilet seat, toilet paper everywhere like a bomb went off...just gross.  My husband said that the men's room was worse. He said that is was flooded from a toilet and also in severe disarray.  While we enjoyed our food and company, we will not likely come back. They need to do some major examination of cleanliness and service practices.",

The pizza is good which is why it gets three stars but when we went last night I just couldn't believe how long it took when she was not the only server working. You would think when you are serving so close to your managers or leads that you would be working better to show your strengths but this was terrible. She not once ever refilled my water even after asking and putting it out for her to see. She never once looked at how I never touched my Awful margarita and said hey I noticed you haven't touched your margarita is everything okay? Nope not once. My fiance asked for a side of ranch and we definitely never got that either. I seriously couldn't believe how little this server cared.  Definitely will not be back anytime soon. Maybe a different location is better or just order to go from now on for their specials.",

She answered all my questions and asked in the kitchen to check that the bread bowl was vegan. They had a vegan option labeled on the menu, a lentil soup. They also had other plates that could be made vegan. I ordered guacamole and the soup. The appetizer came out quickly and was great. Our food came out really late and they mixed up my order but the manager came out and apologized and checked in with us. The food was really good, pretty filling. It's a good place to go for big groups and for a nice dinner. Everyone in our group found something they liked on the menu and everyone ended up happy with their meal. Would recommend this place!",

My fav item on the menu used to be the calzone until they took it off--bring it back guys! They also have some bomb salads if you're not in the mood to go carb-heavy. But of course, the star of the show is the famous Pizookie! I've had all different kinds but the original chocolate chip is still the best. If you haven't been to BJ's yet, you need to do yourself a favor and head over! Your taste buds will thank you!",

That is often a problem with sports bars with large dining areas.  4 stars = The food was above average. I had the New Orleans Jambalaya. It was very good. Well seasoned and the food was cooked just right. Only complaint is there was too much meat and not enough rice. Wasn't mixed perfectly but still good.  3 stars = The menu is too random. Like they haven't decided what type of food they are going to master. Because of this the food is different every time I come here. The food depends on which cook  is cooking which meal.   2 stars = The server was awful. The only reason I am giving the server a 2 is because the server delivering the appetizers and food was very pleasant. Our server tried to remember the order but forgot and had to come back and ask. She did not refill drinks at all. She actually came by several times and looked at the empty glasses and ignored it.  She was too busy talking with other servers to pay attention to her tables.   3 stars = Total Review   I will try this restaurant again.",

After watching more restaurant rescue shows than are healthy I should have learned a long time ago that any place with a menu the size of a phone book does mediocre food at best.  BJs is no exception to this rule.  The menu appeared to be heavy on pizza like products so I figured going that direction was the best bet...so I ordered a flat bread.  It was supposed to have tomatoes, cheese and sausage.  Tomatoes, yes.  Cheese, yes.  Sausage...not so much.  There were a few (and I mean a few, sausage piece like substance on the flat bread, but I wouldn't say it was enough to qualify as saying the flat bread had sausage.  As for the bread part of the flat bread it was crispy in parts and soggy in parts.  Overall not a good effort.  So assuming you can't make the most prominent thing on your menu (pizza like products) well it is fair to assume that the products on the other 90 pages of the menu (yes an exaggeration...its probably only 12 pages long) are, in all likelihood, mediocre also.",

    "text": "My man had a wild hair to go here tonight and so we went. We both ordered top sirloin, but his came with a bleu cheese butter sauce on top. Mine came with no toppings, and the waitress didn't offer steak sauce. Hmm. Since I like my steak well done, one would surmise that I would probably want something to dip it in or pour over it, n'est-ce pas? But no. We waited for her to come back, he asked her for steak sauce and she comes back and puts it on HIS side of the table. You know, the side with the steak that already has a topping. Uhduh?   Also, I ordered my steak well done and it was perfect, albeit DRY as there was no sauce and I almost choked on it. But he ordered his medium, and it came out with no pink. Huh?  All in all, a good deal for the dinners which were around $16 each. Good calamari app. Nom nom. The wine I chose was delicious - a blend, they're usually better. The garlic mashed potatoes were yummy too. This is the 2nd time we've dined here since moving to Phoenix and I still give it a thumbs up. The first time I enjoyed the \"Enlightened Thai Chicken Mango Salad\" and highly recommend it if you're into that kind of dish. But if you order steak, be careful to order it less done than you really want it. I probably could've played hockey or maybe football with mine. Good gracious.  No other snafu's tonight, except that the tables outside were a bit too close and as the large party next to us was being seated, my boyfriend had a bunch of butts in his face. Back that ass up, ladies....actually, WE had to push our table away twice. And later a waiter was trying to carry like a million plates away from a table and of course he dropped them and scared us, giving us a few more grey hairs (thanks a lot). This stuff happens and it's like eh, whatever, who cares. But these details do kind of dampen the ambiance.   Really love the large selection of everything! Iron out the deets, BJ's Brewhouse!",

They have a great and fairly affordable lunch menu with lots of options, including lots of vegetarian options.  I also really appreciated that my waitress went back and checked with a vegetarian staff member to see if the tomato soup had meat stock (it didn't, but minestrone did).  I got the pasta with the soup or salad combo with this delicious Mediterranean pasta - olive oil, feta, pine nuts, tomatoes and red peppers.  The pasta itself was surprisingly bland, but with a hint of salt and pepper, it was pretty tasty.  The bread that it came with was also delicious, all on its own.  I got the tomato soup, and man, it was definitely one of the better tomato soups I've been lucky enough to have.  My server was great about the food coming out quickly, and was on top of my refills.  Very friendly, not over-crowding.  I'll be back in the future with my partner to get a better feel for the beer (which I don't drink) and meat dishes (which I don't eat), but I'm happy with my first visit and will be back!",

    "text": "We were at a fund raiser and they were handing out this amazing chicken salad with all kinds of fresh and delicious ingredients.  We asked where the salad was from and we were told BJ's.  So, after the fundraiser, we head over to BJ's.  We were told that there was a 15 minute wait so we sat out on a bench right outside of the restaurant.  The dancing water show is really cool to watch and helps quickly pass the time.  After a few minutes of waiting, a waiter came out and offered us a sample slice of pizza.  Wow!  That was the best, melt-in-your-mouth pizza my taste buds have ever been introduced to!  Now, I had a serious dilemma!  I was there for their yummy salad but the pizza was so awesome that I wanted the pizza too.  But, I didn't want to leave 20 lbs heavier.  When we sat down, my wife and I ordered a beer...the root kind.  Amazing!  If you like root beer, this place has a very smooth and great tasting \"homemade\" root beer.  I ordered the Chicken Barbecue Salad (I think that what it's called) and sure enough, it was just as good as it was at the fundraiser.  The atmosphere was great too!  My wife and I were hypnotized by the brightly lite bottles on display at the bar.  When we were finished with the meal, we were really bummed that we were full.  We wanted to get Pazookie!  So, our waiter went the extra mile and made it portable.  Yes, Pazookie to go was awesomely delicious even if you eat it for dessert at home.    If you're in the Chandler area and you need some excellent food.  Try out BJ's!",

There was not a welcoming smile or even look when she asked number of party. She then explained how to find our table and told us to go sit and she would bring the menus along. First impression of one of my favorite past times was horrible, however, the server was amazing and the food was delicious. Must try the honey-crisp  chicken salad!",

Everything that I have ordered is always excellent brewery food. My favorite lunch is the California Club flatbread pizza but you can't go wrong with the soup and salad or the sliders. They have a huge menu too. C'mon it's a brewery so you just know that it awesome.",

    "text": "I think that BJ's is a hit-and-miss kind of place. Today was just meh. We three gals were out to lunch before a movie at the Chandler Mall location. The menu is huge, the TV's are on with sports action, the drinks were cold, service is adequate, and the food is too. We all had salads - three different salads actually. I had the ahi tuna and though the tuna was plentiful throughout, the tuna was way too peppery and the salad was soggy. One of my friends had the Thai chicken mango salad with the dressing on the side, which made it a lot less goopy. My other friend had the honey crisp chicken salad but the chicken was missing-in-action. It sure didn't look like the picture. Our server was unfamiliar with the menu and couldn't answer our questions. Maybe she was new? I know that it's tough to be a waiter/waitress and they sure do work hard. But hey, a smile and some friendly service goes a long way with me.",

    "text": "BJ's is OK on occasion. My husband loves the mostly sauceless, tomato-strewn pan pizza. Me, not so much. However, the atmosphere seems fun (kind of loud, but that drowns out our usual loud talking). There are flatscreen TVs throughout the restaurant, in case a game or a major weather event (hurricane season) is on. The booth seating is comfy, and we see a lot of families, so it looks pretty kid-friendly as well.  I've tried various dishes here, such as sliders washed down with BJ's Hefeweizen. The sliders and thin fries were pretty darned yummy, and the 5 oz. taster-sized Hefeweizen was the perfect size (and price!) for a lightweight and/or someone who has to drive soon thereafter... I am not a beer connoisseur, so YMMV! On separate occasions, I've tried the Angel Hair Toscana dish, which was just OK and came with a side of garlic bread. I've had the French dip on a couple occasions, and that is highly recommended; I love a good au jus... The other night I tried the Field of Greens salad with candied pecans, feta, red peppers, and a balsamic vinaigrette; that was quite yummy. I coupled that with a taster-sized Berry Burst Cider, which is really sweet and hit the spot.  For dessert, the Cookies N' Cream Pizookie is quite good, so you might want to save room for that (be sure to share it with 1 or 2 more people ~ it's rich and should feed at least 2)! The Apple version pales in comparison ~ don't bother with that... Finally, I'm a caffeine fiend, so I was pleasantly surprised that their coffee does not taste like old socks.  I recommend BJ's for a casual night out.",

    "text": "BJ's has a very large menu, too large I think. When you have large chain restaurants with huge menu's you already know that they are trying to cater to the masses rather than producing a really quality specialty item. For the most part I was pleased with my order. I went with the Creole Tilapia, which is on their under 575 calorie menu. I considered the Chicken A La Fresca but the waiter advised me that it wasn't that great. I was very appreciative of his insight and honesty. The beer they serve was pretty good as well. On tap they have everything from a light beer to a nutty oatmeal stout. If you aren't sure what you're in the mood for then BJ's is a good place to go as they have descent food and tons of it.",

So, today I went to the Chandler restaurant for a work lunch in hopes of  satisfying the craving. Work hours meant no beer...maybe that's why I didn't inhale this one as fast. It was still good. I'd order it again. I'd also order the Pizookie made with  peanut butter cookie. That devilish little treat (that I shared, btw) got me on a new PB craving. Ugh.  The salad was $10.95, and came with well-seasoned chicken (minor kick), corn, avocado, tomatoes, red onions, tortilla strips and a good dressing.",

    "text": "I rarely write reviews but after this current scenario I just had to. I visit this location very often. I rarely have a bad experience. About 1 year ago, I was there and ordered an appetizer, salad and dinner. The appetizer was stuffed mushrooms that were served ice cold. We told the waiter (bartender) and they took care of removing it from the bill and brought a new \"hot\" one. When my salad was served, I had requested creamy garlic dressing (which they no longer offer) and instead, it came mixed with some type of vinaigrette along with creamy garlic. The manager now had to come over for the second time and agreed something was wrong and again replaced the item. My main course (pasta and chicken) was excellent. The manager removed all the defective items from our bill along with a discount and I was happy with that. Now about 6 weeks ago, I returned and ordered a new item that the waitress recommended. It was the deep dish lasagna. It was disgusting and below the first layers the food was ice cold. I called the waitress over and told her the issue. She sent the manager over and he agreed something was wrong. He left the table and the waitress brought the tab which had no adjustment for the lasagna that was inedible. I was so pissed that I paid the tab along with a 20% tip as she did a good job. I wrote to the company the following day about my dining experience and was immediately contacted by the store manager who apologized. He stated that he meant to take the lasagna off the bill but got busy talking to some people and forgot. He told me to provide my address which I did so he could mail me a gift card to try an entree on them next time.  That was 6 weeks ago !!! I'm guessing he may no longer be managing there anymore.....",

    "text": "I am no stranger to BJs - I grew up in California, which is where this chain originated from.  I'm not a fan of this BJs. We live about 10 minutes away from it, but I find we go to the one on Superstition Springs more often. We go to BJ's for the food, never the drinks.  Hubby's a huge beer lover. When we lived in San Francisco, we used to do pub crawls with our friends in search of the perfect pint of Guinness.  Anyway, we went to this BJs because he had heard good things about the beer here, more specificially, their brewmaster. He'd read rave reviews and thought, \"why not?  we're practically around the corner!\"  Off we trotted and he ordered the beer and I ordered a salad...and he was angry.  Angry at beer. What?! Not again. It's ok.  I was angry at my salad and the slower service.  He finally learned his lesson - never get the beer at BJs. The first BJs experience was back in California at the BJs in Cupertino, across the street from the Apple campus (yes, as in iPod). He and his best drinking mate, Matt, went for beer...one they ordered tasted like Juniper. The second one he ordered \"tasted like how sweaty gym socks smelled\". His exact words.  *gags a little*  He thought it would be different at this BJs...but was sadly mistaken  BJs on the whole will never have imported beer. If you want a decent selection of imported beer, I suggest going to Whole Foods -- you can pick up Belhaven!  My salad pissed me off.  There was more dressing than salad. I wanted some lettuce with my dressing. Our server kept sneaking off - don't want to know what he was doing outside for long periods of time and come back smelling of smoke.  My suggestion?  Seriously? Skip this BJs and go eat at one of the other restaurants. This one won't do it for beer...or food.",
