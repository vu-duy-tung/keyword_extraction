    "text": "Tried this little gem because of all the great reviews we had read on yelp and, WOW, did it live up to its rating!!! From the moment we walked in and, was greeted til the time we left everything was completely 1st rate! My daughter had the waffle with strawberry compote and, the waffle was perfectly crunchy on the outside but, soft on the inside. The compote was sweet with a hint lemon so, it wasn't too sweet. My wife created her own omelet that included cheddar, roasted red pepper and sausage with a side of their wonderful greenchile sauce(we spent 16 years in New Mexico and, feel we know how a good GC sauce should taste). I had their house made cornbeef hash with eggs and a side of their homemade potatoes. A lot of times when I've ordered a house made cbhash it usually comes out as just the cured shredded beef but, at Alo they cure the beef then create a True hash by mincing the beef with potatoes and seasonings. OMG, it was one of the best hashes I've ever tasted. My eggs were perfectly cooked and the potatoes were nicely seasoned then pan fried bites of yummy goodness!!! We live in Oregon but, if I were a Phoenician I would be dining at the Alo at least once a week!!! The service was outstanding with our server explaining the cafe is influenced by Estonian flavors so, he explained some of the dishes on the menu then, pointed out some of his personal favs.",

We were politely warned upon arrival that the wait time after ordering would be about 30 minutes due to them having a small kitchen, which was fine with us. We had seen the reviews and were thrilled to try the food! We got seated immediately and were given waters and menus, and then were left alone for 30 minutes before we unfortunately decided to get up and go eat somewhere else. We saw lots of staff walking around and serving other tables--as a matter of fact, there was an employee wearing the Alo Cafe shirt chatting with the table next to us for at least 15 minutes. The food might be worth it, and I will probably never find that out for myself. Just wanted to share my birthday breakfast disappointment.",

This is a mom n pop restaurant so it's obviously on a smaller scale but it had good ambiance and even better food... Service was stellar.  There's really no complaints as even my child who's a very picky eater and is now into pancakes was disappointed that they didn't have them. He went for the waffles thinking he was going to be disappointed: he wasn't! There's only other place that he would eat waffles in Oregon and so for him to have the biggest smile after the first bite was a sight to see...  We really enjoyed our meals, felt the freshness in every bite and especially going to another restaurant that claimed to have fresh marketplace food and got served cold tasteless eggs this seems like a go-to place for fresh food and supporting the small business.  Con: not enough parking but if you get here early it shouldn't be a problem and it's oh so WORTH it!",

    "text": "It's 84 degrees and gently overcast on a Sunday morning. I am seated at a small cafe table on the patio at Alo Cafe. A slight breeze blows through green leaves of bushes and the tree beside me. This is my very first time here.  When I arrived around 10:00a, the patio was already full, so I found a seat inside. I was immediately greeted by a very busy, though cheerful, Alicia. She informed me that a seat outside would likely be a 10 minute wait and apologized for the inconvenience.  I was not in any hurry, so made myself comfortable and ordered a pour-over coffee. A few minutes later, the coffee was served and I placed an order for the breakfast sandwich with sausage and cheddar cheese.  Around 10:35, Alicia let me know that a couple of tables had opened up outside, so I decided to migrate. I found a spot in the back corner of the patio under a small tree. It felt like a miniature getaway all my own.  Nick came by to check up on me and offered to refill my coffee. I gladly accepted. Both he and Alicia were very attentive and polite throughout the course of my visit. Eventually, my sandwich made it's way out to me. I had been waiting for some time, but didn't mind in the least.  Still, Alicia apologized for the long wait, explaining that it was due to a large group take-out order and informing me that my coffee was on the house as an apology. The sandwich wasn't amazing, but I loved that they used real egg. Felt very homemade.  I ordered a mango/ginger scone \"for dessert\" and received another coffee refill. Both the coffee and the scone were delicious. The check came with a \"No rush - stay as long as you like.\" And I did. Just me and the bushes and my tree and the singing birds.  Do I absolutely love this place and the people I got to meet here? Yes, so much. Would I recommend Alo Cafe? Without a moment's hesitation. If you haven't been, I can't recommend it highly enough.  Sit inside if you want the noisy bustle of a village cafe. Sit outside to disappear into a quieter, garden-like retreat. If you're super lucky, you'll get the same great attention from the same great team of servers that I did.  Alicia and Nick - thank you both for being so wonderful. Alo Cafe - thank YOU for being the hidden gem that you are. I'll be sure to visit again, and I'll be sure to send others your way every chance I get.  :)",

It had such unique ingredients and flavors! I am not kidding you when I say that every single bite of it was more and more amazing! When I was close to finishing it I was kind of sad actually. The chef also brought out this specialty sauce with ketchup and other delicious ingredients it had a spice to it. I love that this cozy cafe has an outdoor area because I really enjoy outdoor brunches. The waitress was attentive and made sure we didn't need anything throughout our meal. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking to try unique spices and homemade custom specialty menu options.",

Highly recommend.   **Update** I've been here at least 10 times and I really love the food, but the service is not good. Every time they blame it on servers not showing, but at what point do you not get new servers!   Food is easily 5 stars, but the service needs improvement.",

The food is fresh and the bakery items are amazing. We shared a chocolate chip scone served with softened butter and it heavenly; crisp on the outside warm ans moist on the inside. My husband had the Mediterranean Omelet which he really enjoyed and I had a build your own omelet with spinach, mushrooms and cheddar, very tasty with just the right balance of ingredients. Oven roasted potatoes come as a side and they were good. My Mom had the Belgium waffle with a generous helping of whip cream and strawberries and she loved it. We all shared the french press coffee which always prefer and it was very good; hot strong and not bitter.",

When we walked inside we were met with only slightly cooler air than the outside.  Maybe the A/C was broken.  Service was pleasant but sparse.  One girl running around for everyone.    We ordered and were advised that the breakfast potatoes were not ready.  We said we would be happy to wait for them to be done.  Our drinks were awful.  The water had a garden-hose or bad tap water taste and the iced black tea tasted fermented.  We exchanged the tea for Lemonade and it was fine.  Our omelette arrived overcooked - the eggs had brown spots on it.  Either the grill was too hot or they were cooked too long.  Ingredients were fresh though so that was a plus.  Potatoes were Rosemary oven roasted.  Flavor was alright but nothing special and they still weren't cooked through.    For the price, we expected more flavor or service or better tasting food.   The one good thing about the place was the large assortment of unique hot sauce and condiments.    Overall - left no longer hungry but was unsatisfied.",

I had already decided to go there and several folks at brunch on Saturday confirmed I needed to try it out. We got there early and were invited to grab a seat on the patio and relax while they finished getting ready. I would say 2/3 of the seating is outside so I am sure it could be too hot or too cold parts of the year. The tables are pretty much squeezed in wherever. Spring time just after sunrise was perfect on the patio. I had the corned beef hash which is brined in house and was delicious. R had the Monte Cristo with a side of potatoes/onions and raved about it. Shortly after opening the owner came in with his puppy and had his morning cup of coffee and chatted with the customers. There is also a cat who seems to own the courtyard but stayed away from people. The owner mentioned that being Scottsdale things did not get crowded until 8-9. So: food great, atmosphere great, service great. I hope I get a chance to go back again.",

Inside is very small, so if you don't like getting cozy this place might not be for you!  they do have seating outside as well, I saw someone with their pup sitting out there when I came. Looking at all the pics I already knew I had to try the waffle cristo!! Ordered that and it was SO GOOD. Serving size was more than enough and I just came in after running a few miles so I was definitely ready to get my grub on!! Hubby got the pastrami burrito and that was just as incredible! Mom got a fried egg sandwich and it came on its own so I would suggest ordering a side with that one! Coffee was a little overpriced in my opinion, a little over 3 bucks. They also have pastries though! Ordered the candied almond scone and it was pretty good! I really wanted to give 5 stars because of how phenomenal the food was but we had to wait forever to get our food and then it took forever to get our bill when we were ready to go. Someone that looked like possibly was the owner was just standing in the corner watching everyone as the only 2 servers were frantically running around trying to get everything done, not a great leader in my opinion. Other than that the servers were super nice! I will definitely still return the next time I want a great breakfast!",

    "text": "First of all let me start by saying I have never posted a review online. The fact that I am taking time out of my day to write this review shows how disappointed I was with this place.  First of all I want to address the time issue. I went there on my lunch break, big mistake. The food took forever and I had to ask for a to go box before I  even got my food. Perhaps this is because there was only one server, and one cook. My next issue is the food. I ordered the Monte Cristo Waffle and was very disappointed, flavor was band, nothing special. I picked at it a bit as I was on my lunch break and hungry, but ended up not eating it. I walked out of there, paying for a meal that took too long, and that I didnt eat because the flavor was just not there for me. This placed looked promising online, the atmosphere is very relaxing, sadly the service and food just werent there.",

    "text": "I was both surprised and impressed with Alo when a coworker suggested we try lunch there yesterday. The place is small and discreet, and despite living two streets away, I wasn't even aware it existed until we spotted it walking to Cornish Pasty. The menu was rather limited, but the Sedona chicken sandwich was unbelievable! It looked like it should be pictured on a menu and tasted even better!!! They let me swap fruit in for chips, and it was the perfect lunch meal. The setting is great, with lots of plants and flowers surrounding their shady patio. The service was a little hands-off, but very kind and helpful. I can't wait to go back and try something new! I wish they offered a few salads, but seriously, I would be happy again any day with that sandwich! Fresh, delicious and an awesome discovery!",

If it's not too hot, park yourself out on the patio- it's a small place, but the service and food are largely worth it. I ordered the Yucatan Omelet- shrimp, zucchini and a chipotle cream sauce.. doing it over, I'd definitely do it again. Greg had the Chi omelet- it has a special sausage with cream cheese and a green chile sauce. Truly unique, but every ingredient made sense and added to the dish. We also ordered a side of the ghost hot salsa... wow, the flavor is fire in more ways than 1!  Go get it..",

A Corn Flake crust on one side kept the dish crunchy to the last bite. I recommend ordering a side of the \"real maple syrup\" - even though there's a $2 up-charge (no one should eat French toast with anything other than real maple syrup.). I ordered a house-made sausage patty & enjoyed it so much, I ordered an additional patty. Interestingly, the flavor was a bit different with the 2nd patty - which isn't uncommon with the subtleties of house-made sausages.   The waitstaff is attentive & very nice. There's indoor & outdoor sitting. The food is cooked to order & they ask you to tell them right up front if you have time constraints.",

The omelet includes: spicy sausage, white cheese, and homemade green chili. The side potatoes provided the right mix of crunchy edges and soft insides. Overall, this breakfast was peppery/good!  My daughter ordered Alo's signature French toast. It is made with crunchy corn flakes on the toast's faces.

However loved it regardless  2. Housemade curry ketchup -Omg to die for. Prob. Would buy some if I could!  3.Corn beef hash- it was very good and very different from the CB hash I've had in the past, given most restaurants just take it from a can. You can tell this is housemade and fresh.  4. Chi town heat omlette- super good, I could feel the heat rising from my tongue. The sausage was the best part.  5. Corn flake French toast - I only had a couple bites because I was super full. It was good..it was just like regular French toast, but breaded in corn flakes which gave it that CRUNCH, with a nice moist on the inside. I've been to quite a few breakfast places and I always order French toast ..so the way this was prepared in terms of moistness is one of the top.  6. Hash browns- this was yummy and paired with the housemade curry ketchup it was hella good!!!   The staff was very accomdating and the overall ambience had a nice homely feel. I hate restaurants that are too big and feel less personal, because I get that greasy feeling in my stomach.  I felt like I was eating in someone's kitchen, which is a beautiful feeling.",

Why only four stars? Table was quite wobbly - easy fix with either something placed under one of the supports or adjusting the feet - and the syrup isn't real maple syrup. A lot of places here in Arizona don't seem to use real maple syrup. There is an obvious viscosity difference and the entire taste/texture is different. I'll have to bring along my own maple syrup for any future visit here or elsewhere.  I'd return though, very good food - not greasy or fake tasting like some breakfasts I've had.",

The girl serving us got us seating quickly and took our order once we had decided. The iced coffee was on point and if you're a waffle kinda guy I would really recommend it. Overall, sweet people with good service, good quality food. Not expensive and filling. Will be back when in Arizona. Also love the vibe outside, if it's not too hot out.",

After half of the wait and NO attention, I moved inside, got a menu and sat while my group followed.  The owner comes up to me (FINALLY ATTENTION), but just to ask if I would be using all the seats...wft?? I told the owner my group and I were waiting outside for 30 mins with no service.  He just said okay, can back to wipe the table, then no service again.  The food in the pix looked great, the food and even water served to others looked great, but we honestly felt invisible.  Just the worst and we were all excited to try out the place.  Oh and at one point the owner came back from buying two bags of ice and blocked cars in the process.  Just walked out, and went to brat haus, got served in less than one min with ice in our waters.",

People are quick to review bad places or experiences but, if a place is good we tend to forget.  *Never forget every place can have off times or employees can be having a bad day.  So I try to always give the benefit of the doubt on any review.  I also have worked in many fields so I tend to know what is acceptable and what is not.  With all the being said I really liked this place and will add it into my breakfast rotation.  However, I tend to favor the small \"hole in the wall\" (I say that loosely because I mean more low key) places.   My Food was great! This was a very home cook flare with some, international flavors.  I love the choices, and it was hard to make a choice.  What I ordered was amazing!  I want to try more soon.   My Service was great! The waitress was very friendly, spent time answering all our questions and made sure that we liked her recommendations.  We asked am million questions and she was so patient with us but, we also came on off peak hours (no waitress can do that on ON peak hours).  She even brought out agave nectar with my Yerbamate tea I was trying, just in case I wanted it sweeter.  She was right on the money & I didn't have to find her.  As a past Hooter's waitress (you may not like the restaurant but we had great training policies), we were suppose to predict what a customer needed before they asked.  So it was great on her part :)    The Atmosphere was cozy! We sat outside because I am obsessed. It was comfortable and cozy.  It isn't a big place so it gives you that small town feel.  I love it!    The owner came out and talked with us! I love seeing this because you know that the owner really cares about his business and you can see his passion.",

And the eggs were super super runny. Won't go back.",

The wait for food was very long but it was a very small place with not a lot of staff so it was understandable. The food was also well worth the wait however, I have never had hash like this before and the waffle cisco was a whole experience in it self! Don't come starving and bring someone you want a lot of time to talk to because the food is worth twice the wait.",

    "text": "Alo Cafe is a small hidden gem tucked away with a globally inspired menu that is made from scratch!  We went here on a Sunday morning for Brunch. At first we weren't sure where the cafe was but its the brick building hidden behind Cornish Pasty. There's a few parking spots located in front of Alo, if they are full, there is free street parking offered.   They have an adorable little patio and inside it is small with some seating offered. The decor gives it a homey feel and the staff are extremely welcoming. Since many of the dishes here are inspired by Estonia and Europe, be prepared to wait for these dishes. The restaurant prides itself on making its items from scratch which falls in line with it's cultural ties.  I ordered the Horchata latte but they were out of the main ingredient. Our waitress offered to make me something similar which was a mix between their Havana and Horchata latte. She even gave me some cute latte art which was a flower.   For the food, I was torn between a couple of their dishes. I decided to try the Tortilla Espanola which was reminiscent of a quiche but had a few more ingredients. I tried the traditional Romesco sauce which was a mix of a red wine paste, red peppers and almonds. If you have a nut allergy stay away from the Romesco, but they offer an alternative of Garlic Aoli. It was light and filling enough that I had room for dessert.  My husband ordered the Monte Cristo, I'm usually not a fan but this sandwich was amazing! The bread was so flavorful and made from their corn flake crusted french toast. The jam was amazing and blended perfectly. At the end of our meal, we ordered the Kringel French toast. The plate was huge but the toast was amazing! Especially with some syrup on top, yum!  Overall we had a wonderful experience at this cafe. Just remember that if you are in a hurry, this is probably not the restaurant for you. Sometimes you have to wait for quality and food made from scratch. I highly recommend and this as a nice twist from the traditional breakfast we eat here in America.",

The only waitress was the epitome of \"grace under pressure\", as she and the owner (Steve) worked to accommodate everyone, and provide excellent service.   I had the chi-town heat omelette, with potatoes, and a side of South African breakfast sausage. Everything was AWESOME.  I would describe the menu as \"eclectic international\".

    "text": "Great little spot! Hot, delicious coffee, incredible food, prompt and delightful service, beautiful intimate outdoor seating (about 30 seats), and cozy indoor seating (about 20?). Gluten and dairy free food and beverages offered.   This was literally some of the best breakfast food I have ever eaten, in any of the dozen or so countries I've been to, no joke. The Waffle Cristo was to die for! Soft, hot waffle with melted Swiss, both ham and turkey, and an over-easy egg, served with jam and the thickest maple syrup I've ever had on the side. Crispy bacon and potatoes made everything even better; I even tried their house-made curry ketchup (despite not loving curry), and combined with the rosemary on the potatoes my taste buds were singing! My Americano was nice and hot, and so big I could've gotten half to go! Low-level tunes by Pink Floyd, Zeppelin, CCR, etc, and fall breezes made for a very relaxing morning. What a gem, I can't wait to return.",

As I entered the cafe, i seemed to be the very first guest of the day and I was greeted by a beautifully sweet server, Sarah, who catered to my every need in a timely manner and was as charming and as welcoming as a server can get.   I sat inside the cozy interior and was given a  menu and my drink order was placed. I chose the iced latte with 2 shots of espresso and might I say it was one of the best iced lattes I've ever had. It was very nice to see that all of the coffee drinks are made in house and Sarah did an amazing job with my drink. I later ordered breakfast; the chitown omelette which was recommended to me and  I'd absolutely recommend to anyone! The perfect balance of spicy and savory from the sausage with a hint of sweetness from the cream cheese filling. Add this with a side of perfectly cooked house potatoes and you have a breakfast experience that you won't soon forget. The delicious food, the incomparable service, and the small cafe atmosphere here is something that has me begging for more and I'll definitely be back to try the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "Actually very disappointed. Heard a lot of good things. Cute little neighborhood place but food did not measure up. Service was fine but the kitchen was very slow. Table on each side of us waited over 50 minutes for their food. When their's came we asked if  it was worth the wait. Both tables pretty much said 'Eh'. After about 45 minutes our food finally showed up and it was 'Eh' too. We did order a fresh baked apricot scone which was awesome! And the Americano coffees were very good. Bacon was severely under cooked and fatty. Toast & bruschetta that came with the omelettes had a peculiar tasted, potatoes tasted greasy and omelettes just OK. Too many excellent places for brunch in the area to won't be heading back.",

    "text": "We were happy to finally find a neat little breakfast cafe with character while visiting family in Arizona. The service was excellent and breakfast was great. I kept it simple with two eggs over-easy, sausage links, potatoes, and rye bread, while my husband tried a chorizo omelette with cheese and a green sauce on top. I can't remember what it was called, but I liked it a lot. They have curry ketchup to go with the potatoes, just like they have in Germany. My over-easy eggs were cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of salt. I couldn't decide between the eggs or the Estonian dessert bread French toast. Kinda regret that I didn't get to try the French toast, but everything was great nonetheless. Highly recommend stopping in if you're visiting Scottsdale.",

Really cute patio area with a small inside eating area.  Sat ourselves down in the patio and waited for service.  And waited for service.  Took a while to get menus, then a while to get water/drinks, etc.  Server was real nice but didn't come around often.  Had a waffle, french toast and omelet.   Everything was very good, although the omelet was a little small for me (maybe 2 eggs?).  Also had a chicken salad sandwich to go which was also very good.  They use a flavorful combination of seasonings.  Prices are very reasonable, location is great, wi-fi, food is very good.  Docked 1 star for the slow service and a couple of food issues.",

    "text": "TL;dr --average to good food, good atmosphere, TERRIBLE service.  I'll start out with the good.  Alo is adorably nestled out of the hustle and bustle of Old Town Scottsdale.  The menu had variety but wasn't overwhelming.  The atmosphere, on a good day, would have been charming.  I would rate the food quality fairly high, but only because I tasted the food on my friends' plates.  Here is where we get to the bad.  We arrived at Alo, excited about the almost-five-star rating, and cute location.  We got there around 9:30 am, to beat the worst of the Scottsdale rush.  As we approached, I noticed several grumpy faces on the half dozen people waiting to be seated/served.  It looked busy, but not slammed.  When we put our name in for a table and were told to wait about 15 minutes for a seat, the hostess seemed flustered and confused, almost as if she was surprised that anyone showed up to eat at the restaurant that morning.  She asked us where we wanted to sit as if we had a choice, and as if it weren't her responsibility to find us an open table.  During the wait time, I witnessed at least one angry customer complaining to the hostess about the wait for his table or food.  We were finally seated 15-20 minutes later, and it was at least another 10 minutes before a waitress came to bring our water.  Someone came back to take out food orders about 10 minutes after that, and I am pretty sure it was a different waitress.  It seemed like they didn't have assigned tables or sections.  She offered one of the guests at our table gluten-free toast as a substitute for normal bread, which was a major plus.    We waited about 20 minutes for our food, which is a little bit on the long side for eggs/sausages/tea, but not completely unreasonable.  When the food arrived, they forgot my food (or got the order completely wrong--still unclear).  I sent back what they brought (not even CLOSE to my order), and awaited the replacement patiently.  Also, my friend asked to be sure that her toast was actually gluten free, just to confirm.  The waitress seemed very offended or annoyed that she would even ask, but confirmed that it was, in fact, the gluten-free toast.  My food never came.  No one came back to check on us.  No one refilled our water.  No one brought us silverware (I had to go inside and ask the very confused hostess where I could get my own silverware).  After we had been finished eating for OVER 20 minutes, our 11:15 appointment was quickly approaching so I gave up on my food.  My friend went inside to ask for the check.  She had to do this twice.  Of course, when they brought the check, my food was still on it.  We promptly sent it back, with no apology or question from the waitress about whether I actually wanted my food.  The waitress seemed annoyed that we brought it up at all.  My overall impression of the staff is that they had no patience for the customers, no desire to serve the customers, and generally no desire to be in business at all.    I've been to many a brunch in the Phoenix area, and most are INSANELY busy on a Sunday.  The staff members are usually experienced and handle the rush with grace or at least tolerance.  Mistakes happen, but one would expect an apology or remedy of some kind.  I will not be returning to Alo Cafe or recommending it to any of my friends.",

It is a very small and quaint cafe type feel, and is tucked away in old town and has a very different (but good) vibe compared to other places in this area.   The reason for the 3/5 stars is for the service. The waiters all share tables to they often forgot or took a very long time to come over or bring us something we asked for. They were all nice and I would get confused remembering who is doing what. They also need new umbrellas out front. It was nice in the shade but unfortunately their umbrellas had tons of huge rips and the sun was beating down on us.   I would come back but probably get the food to go or sit inside to at least not be so hot.",

Ordered a shrimp and salmon omelette, which I had never seen listed on a menu before, along with many other items. Don't get me wrong, it was very good, but the eggs were a bit runny and the salmon was way over-cooked. Potatoes were potatoes...one of the best food items there in my opinion was their Curry ketchup! SO good if you like both curry and ketchup, and again, something I had never seen previously.   The coffee was average, the service was good but not great, and the atmosphere is cute and quaint, but didn't feel as friendly as it should have when we walked in.   If you're looking to try some unique breakfast food, give it a go, but it wouldn't be my top choice to recommend around Old Town Scottsdale.",

The pastrami burrito had almost no pastrami on it while the tortilla espanola was both bland and lukewarm.  For the quality, we felt that they were both overpriced.  The french toast and coffees were both good but that's about it.    Service wasn't particularly good either, unfortunately.  The place was busy but I was disappointed to see several tables of people who were seated after us (and ordered after us) get served before us.  Some of them even had time to finish and pay before we were served.  We had to ask for refills on water, coffee, etc.  All in, it took us 75 mins to get served breakfast for 4 people. Definitely not worth the wait.",

The atmosphere is cute and the food is decent but the service has always lacked. 10 minutes after we sat down we ordered our drinks and asked to order our food also, our waitress said no because other people were there before us and weren't ready to order yet. Then, she brought our drinks (consisting of water and juices) 15 minutes after we ordered them and yet again told us we had to wait to order our food. We were on a time crunch so we went inside after about 35-40 minutes of not getting our food, to complain but the only people who were working were out of sight, so we left. So, I wouldn't recommend going to this restaurant unless you plan to beg to order your food.",

The place is small and a bit cramped but friendly and interesting - the patio will be nice when the weather cools.  I love their menu. Lots of choices and interesting global influence.  For example, the Rusks are an African version of biscotti.  Spanish tortilla omelette.   Great selection of beverages - we opted for the chai lattes, but were also considering the lemon ginger ice tea.    We finally chose the Monte Cristo and the Waffle Barge.  The Monte Cristo was delish - made with their cornflake French toast.  My husband is very picky about his waffles, and he was pleased that the waffle exterior was crisp, so it held up nicely with all the fruit and Nutella goodness.    There were so many great choices we want to try next visit. Omelettes, and savory dishes as well.  And the baked scones!  Yum.",

A waitress came by and I said can I get a second cup of coffee and she said sure. However, I never saw her again either.  When the waiter came by to give me my check and ask if there was anything else. I said no you kind of ruined it,  he gave me that smirk on his face where you just like to slap it right off. That's when I decided I will never come back here again it wasn't Coffee it was this lack of professionalism. Just act professional.

I got the monte cristo and my boyfriend got the breakfast sandwich with sausage, both of which were full of flavor. I'm usually an egg breakfast kind of person so I'm surprised at myself for choosing the monte cristo but I figured it was their signature dish and a must try. I'm happy I did because it really was every level of unique you could have for a dish that's usually the same everywhere. The cornflake French toast, home made jam, and sour cream were random but somehow worked altogether. The green chili which I usually HATE because it's so spicy everywhere was anything but. It was made in-house, green chili grilled outside and freshly made, and definitely something I suggest trying if you usually aren't a typical spicy green chili fan. I'm not sure if we spoke with the owner or manager but one of the gentlemen working there gave us the backstory about the place and why it was called Alo (names after an Astonian composer). They even had the president of Astonia visit them a few years ago with secret service and all lol. I love mom and pop shop kinds of places that have a homey, home cooked meal feeling and this place definitely delivers that. I'd come back for sure.",

    "text": "Rarely do I find a place where the food is really great but the rest of my experience is just so-so; usually, it's the other way around. But today at Alo Cafe I had very good food but the strangest experience.  Slow drip coffee was a wonderful start to brunch and it's nice they offer free refills - although I only got one and would've liked more. I'll get to the service a little later in the review. Ordered two of their most popular dishes: the french toast with hot fruit compote and the monte cristo waffle. Both were excellent! Also ordered a side of bacon but only got two pieces with my meal after being informed by our waitress that the cook dropped the other piece. Hmm...ok?! I waited, and waited, and after finishing the rest of meal finally got a new plate of bacon.  Which brings me to the rest of the experience. Alo Cafe is a super cute spot tucked away on a side street near Old Town Scottsdale. The exterior is quaint and reminds me of a cafe in San Diego. Unfortunately, the interior wasn't so clean and the floors were filthy. The bathroom was equally disgusting. I noticed the hand soap was watery, almost like it had been refilled with water to make it last longer -- yuck! I'll give them a pass on the overflowing restroom trashcan because I'm sure they had a busy Sunday brunch. But after a deep cleaning and with a few little touches of some cute decor, it would be soooo much better!   While we were eating, one of the chefs came out of the kitchen, walked out through the dining area and carried the most dirty, disgusting trash can out to be emptied in the parking lot. I understand a trash can is for trash -- but man, the exterior of it looked like it had never been wiped down. To walk through the dining area with it is not a good look...at all. It was unappetizing and made me think the rest of the kitchen must be filthy. I am glad I visited the restroom after eating. The floors and the rest of the interior of this cafe really really need a deep cleaning.  In terms of service, we lucked out with the ONLY waitress that was actually doing her job. But because of that, she was a little overworked. One of the other waitresses seemed to have major communication issues and some form of social anxiety. She kept delivering incorrect dishes and bills to tables. I witnessed customers having a very challenging dining experience with her. When I walked in to use the restroom, I noticed she was ducked down at the checkout counter texting on her phone. This job didn't seem like a great match for her personality. The third waitress actually seemed to be doing a descent job until I saw her walk to her car and never return -- and she still had open tables! WOW!  So... after all that is said and done, I was wavering between two and three stars. The food and exterior ambience really were great! And our waitress did a descent job for our table. So I decided to be generous and go with three stars. I truly hope they do a deep cleaning of the place and hire some better wait and kitchen staff that can serve customers because the food itself was awesome!",

    "text": "Had a great brunch here last week while we were visiting Scottsdale. Coming from frigid Detroit, it was a pleasure to sit outside and enjoy some warmer weather in January! The patio is lovely!   The eats were also fantastic. Both my husband and I decided to go with some of the more unique items off their menu and we were not disappointed. I went with the kringle french toast (an Estonian sweet bread) and he went with the monte cristo waffle. Both were excellent. The kringle was custardy and lightly sweet, with strawberries and whipped cream it was a decadent breakfast dish. The waffle? Man, I was pretty jealous. The perfect combo of sweet and salty. On a return visit I would definitely order that one myself.   Iced coffees were also great, and inside they have additional seating and some pastries and things you can take to go. A lovely spot that I look forward to visiting again should I find myself in Scottsdale in the future.",

I had the roasted bbq pork loin special, the hubs had the Chi-town  (subbed pepper jack instead of cream cheese) and the kids each had eggs, potatoes and toast. The eggs were too soft for my & the kids' preference but perfect for the hubs. The rest of the food was spot on! Omg that pork was incredible. Everything is made to order and you can tell. We expected much slower service per the expectations set on the menu, but it was just right. Coffee was hot and tasty, hot chocolate was amazing. We will be back!",

She made us wait for well over 15 mins in the empty cafe, took our drink order (one hot chocolate and water), didn't bring it and blamed the kitchen for not adding whipped cream, brought it to the table dropped it off 10 mins later after we asked again and said \"oh yeah we are out, hope you're okay with that\" as she was walking away. Then it tasted like steamed milk only and forgot the water. By this time her service was spoiling the meal and when we asked for the manager she gave a stuck up look and said it would be a few mins. She needs to learn how to serve and be a nice human. We will not be back and we will not recommend this place to anyone.",

Simply put, the service sucked, the owner forces the single patrons to sit outside even when the restaurant is 1/2 empty inside on a 104 day, and asside from a couple original recipes, the quality of the food sucked. I ordered the corned beef hash when he bragged about in person. I asked for it Krispy, and it came out burnt and greasy. I ordered a side of Hashbrows topped with cheese and onions. I told the server I am a lactose intolerant, and to please make sure it was light on the cheese. I think they made them loaded with cheese a soggy with grease on purpose. The only other thing I ordered was the Belgian Waffle with no toppings. Within the 5 minute drive home I was forced to make, the waffle  had become rubbery in texture. The bill came out to almost 27.00!  Oh, I left off my 1 glass of tea the server brought me with no straw and fingers all over the top of the glass where you put your mouth when you don't have a straw. I dont do these reviews often, but I hope someone reads this before having the experience I did. Denny has better quality, better options,  better service, and better prices! BE WARNED!",

I am in the business (40+ years) so i could tell they were frazzled and behind but we heard good things so we decided to stick around. Spring training had just started so I am not sure if they were prepared. Seats about 24 inside and maybe 30 outside. Got our waters immediately but that was the last of the service. Took 15 minutes to get a coffee order and our food order, 10 more minutes to get my coffee served in a paper coffee cup because the dishwasher couldnt keep up? They gave the person sitting next to me a cup later but never offered us one. Had to ask to have my wifes water filled and they ignored mine which was 1/4 of the way filled and right next to hers. Took a total of 45 minutes to get the breakfast served. On the back of the menu it says their food is all scratch and takes time to make. It was an omelette, not sure how many pre made omelettes there are in the world. My wife had a monte cristo, bread, turkey, ham and cheese basically. They did say thanks for your patience when setting the plates down. Don't mine waiting but the omellete was luke warm and looked like a de-flated football. Poorly assembled, hastily made and flat as a pancake. Again, good food would have turned this experience around,  oh and the rye toast was 1/3rd of the way toasted. So untoasted, the butter on it didnt melt. No offer for a refill on coffee, no water refill wthout flagging someone down. Too much touching of the hair and no hand washing. Tables washed down with same towel they were using to clean the coffee counter as it was stained with coffee (literally, the whole towel). Our server was apologetic and friendly enough but just not a good experience for 31$, two entrees and one coffee.  Sorry folks, avoid this on a busy day. They also took the kitchen garbage out of the bag to empty it by carrying it through the dining room instead of just taking the whole can out. Kind of disgusting.  Service was a zero, food was a 2. My wifes sandwich was very good and her potatoes were also cooked to her specs.",

    "text": "Not sure what to make of this place.  I really want to like it.  It's close to my office, the setting is pleasant and relaxed, and the staff is friendly.  But the food is just too hit or miss.  I recently had their Jamaican Curried Rice, which sounded amazing on the menu with onions, peppers, and your choice of protein, but turned out to be a one note bowl of bright yellow soupy rice (my lunch companion felt so bad about my poor choice that he offered me half of his sandwich, which looked good...I declined, and went down with the ship).  Their Reuben, on the other hand, is tasty, if a little on the small side.  The worst thing about Alo is the beverage selection.  I'd probably grab lunch there much more often, given its proximity to my office, but there's just nothing I want to drink with my meal.   Virtually no recognizable beverage selections, like lemonade or conventional sodas.  Instead, the soda selection is a house of horrors, from celery flavored soda to what I had yesterday, which tasted almost exactly like bubble gum.  A bad menu move, and it keeps me away.  Overall, they have some work to do.",

This place is a cozy little spot that can be hard to find if you are not looking closely, but it is very worth it. They have different options from around the world, as well as the American classics. I got the eggs, potatoes and toast, while my parents got the french toast. We were extremely impressed! Everything was excellent about this place, from the owner to the staff. I will definitely be back here again when I'm in Scottsdale. *****",

The cappucino I saw at the next table looked so delicious I ordered one. It was perfect.  More importantly for me, I had the best omelet I have ever had in Scottsdale. I'm from back east and am used to  the filings IN my omelette and cooked thoroughly. This one made my mouth water.  The only suggestion I would have is for a little faster service...or just learn to relax and know you'll be there for awhile.",

Cappuccino was perfect, not bitter or overly sweet. It's harder than you think to get a good cup of cappuccino.   I would recommend the French toast with fruit compote on top. It's not flooded with sauce and doesn't even need syrup. That strawberry sauce was the best thing ever... It will turn you off syrup.   We got the regular monte cristo and the waffle cristo. I neglected to notice that the monte cristo was made with the same French toast so I had a double serving. It's okay, still good. The waffle cristo stood out because of the egg. Looked really good.   Service was fast and overall it's hard to find a complaint.",

Came in and was greeted by the staff, once I said that this was my first time here, the server was so nice and explained a few cool things that are on the menu and that all speciality items are made in house! When I ordered the Belgian waffle with fruit compote, I did not regret my choice! It was soooo delicious and I also got the daily muffin which was the chocolate almond flavor and it was phenomenal. Their outdoor seating is great and perfect for a sunny day. Would definitely recommend this spot!",

    "text": "My wife and I went to this place for breakfast on a Saturday while on vacation in Phoenix. We trusted the yelp 4 star rating unfortunately. First of all I cant comment on the food because we never got it. When we arrived the red headed girl told us to wait 5 minutes to be seated and the place was half empty. Another couple was standing there as well eventually she sat them and we decided to seat ourselves. The waitress was mostly concerned we sat at a two person table which she could have said 5 minutes ago but anyway that was far from the issue. After waiting about 20 minutes the red head took our order. Then we painfully watched as they were clearly cooking one order at a time. When the food finally arrived for the table next to us the man's food had a hair in it. At this point we had been there 45 minutes and still no food. We then asked the waitress for our check and our food to go. We waited another 15 minutes and the couple before us in line got their food. Of course the waitress had made a mistake and the order was wrong. All she did was stare at the guy because she probably knew it was 45 minutes to refire his food. We did not wait to see that outcome. We got up told our waitress we were leaving because it had been an hour for breakfast food. Id like to say she was shocked but she wasnt. I assume the food has to be amazing because otherwise this place would be gone by now. Worst service for a breakfast meal we have ever had.",

We also highly recommend the crunchy French toast if you've got a sweet tooth. Definitely give this place a try before you fall for one of the trendier breakfast spots in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I got a chance to stop the Alo Cafe today. Its a nice quaint place with a good vibe. I looked at their menu on Yelp and saw the a Monte Cristo sandwich, but in another picture was a Monte Cristo waffle? I had to try it! The staff was great. I sat shortly and ordered the Monte Cristo waffle and the South African breakfast sausage. Interesting. One of the waitresses told me the person at the next table was the owner. I asked him what inspired the South African sauasge? He explained how he had it on one of his many travels and how its made. Steve is a nice guy and his family was there celebrating a birthday today. When the Monte Cristo waffle came out; it tasted as good as it looked. I was advised to try the beef hash and it will definitely try it next time. To the whole staff, I thank you for a good breakfast and I'll be back. And thank you Steve for taking the time away to talk with me.  Peace and blessings to all.",

Server appeared a little overwhelmed at all the customers who were ordering as well as clearing tables in time for new customers waiting for tables to open. Once we finally got our table, out order was quick and coffee and water was brought to the table. The staff were very nice and helpful. Food was nice but pretty small servings (unfortunately) - however the flavours were very nice and their house made curry ketchup is just delicious. Great in their South African sausage links or patties - YUM! My wife had the hatch chili omelette - which had barely in spice too it - and she lives her hatch chili's.",

She had a Monte Christo and I had an honey and herb omelet. Both meals were interesting and tasted good. Definitely unique which, was refreshing.   We also ordered 2 cappuccinos. We both didn't like our cappuccinos so, we ended up not drinking them and pushed them to the side (still paid for them). I probably could have spoke up and I'm sure they would have comped them but, since it was my partner's birthday, I went on with my day.   Overall, satisfied with the experience. Good customer service. Quaint place. Tight space, too small for large crowds unless you want to sit outdoors on the patio. The patio was very cute but, too hot at this time of the year.",

Desiree greeted us and gave us a good amount of time to review the rather extensive menu; we never felt hurried.

It's fairly small, but there were tables to spare as early brunchers were clearing out around 12:30pm on a Saturday.  I got the Monte Cristo which was DELICIOUS. The french toast had a crunchy corn flake coating, and that textural difference was SO GOOD. It was very filling without being too heavy. It came with little sides of strawberry jam and sour cream, as well as some syrup. Everyone was super nice, the prices were super reasonable - I can't wait to be back!!!",

The service here is right in line with everything else I've said about them, top notch. Desiree was our server and she was by far my favorite from all of my food experiences in Scottsdale.

I ordered the Chi-town heat omelet and added spinach with the Kringel bread (Estonian bread). My sister ordered the poutine omelet with English muffin. They have boutique teas that have specific purposes. I got the Fountain of Youth tea which reduces stress and balances sugar. I originally asked for jam with my bread, but it was unnecessary as the Kringel bread was a little sweet already with golden raisins and and almond crust top. Food was a good portion. You choose potatoes or bread for your side. Overall a great place to eat. Would highly recommend!",

It wasn't particularly clean or well kept. The paint was peeling and the patio seats were old and dingy. But I trusted the Yelp reviews I read and decided to give it a try despite the odd first impression.   I'm so happy I did!! The food was amazing! I ordered a hot coffee and the Monte Cristo sandwich. Omg the sandwich was great! It's French toast with ham, turkey, and Swiss cheese. I'm not a huge French toast fan, but Alo's French toast is covered in delicious corn flakes. It gives it some texture! It's served with a jam and sour cream. I have never seen a Monte Cristo sandwich served with sour cream but it's a wonderful idea! I love sour cream! Also Alo has a million different hot sauce options! I tried several on my sandwich!   My friend ordered the burrito and Havana coffee! Of course I tried some of each and they were very tasty as well! Both the burrito and my Monte Cristo sandwich were huge! Both were around $12 each, making them an excellent value! I will be back!",

It was more of a patty than a hash, and there was some kind of herb and veggie bits... still it was flavorful and filling.

Cant decide between an omelette or chicken marsala?  I say, why not have both!  Now you can, when you find yourself at Alo.  And just because the waitresses prolly never hear it before, when they arrive at your table, address them with an \"Alo'ooooo, guvnah!\" in your worst cockney accent.  It's totally precocious... or as I like to say \"totes prekotes\"",

It was brunch and dinner, no joke.  Friend had the lox omelet.  I\"m not a salmon in my eggs kinda gal, but she raved about it.  The service was a wee bit slow but very friendly.",

Good thing we got there and got a good spot outside that had cover, as the morning went on it got sunny and hot!  Now for the service and food. I would give service a 4 but the food a 5! Our server was very knowledgeable and suggested what was popular and good to eat. As for follow up after food arrived and filling up drinks not a 5!  We ordered the monte cristo and the green chili omelette! Both were delicious! $28 meal tab for 2 breakfasts and a coffee, so not super cheap, but not outrageous for Old Town either!",

This a great little place with a eclectic coffee house feel. The service was great, efficient and friendly. I had the corned beef and hash. The corned beef is brined there in the kitchen, potatoes were intricately seasoned. It was so tasty. My husband had the Huevos de Madrid and was very satisfied. He has an extremely picky palate, the shrimp was cooked perfectly and with the array of hot sauces you are sure to find a combination to please your taste buds. My daughter who is 4 had the pancakes with fruit compote. She ate most of her meal and left with a full tummy. The price is acceptable specially for the quality of food. We paid 38.00 for all of us to have breakfast plates and specialty drinks. The thing we most enjoyed is the enthusiasm the chef had for his  food and we could tell he took great pride in his job and that money can't buy. Thank you for a great experience.",

They also feature Coffee Cartel drip coffee which is a nice added touch to this little hidden away gem in Old Scottsdale.  If you want to have the \"homemade\" touch, this is the place to go.  It is small, so it can see where the wait may be long if there are many people, like on a Saturday or Sunday morning.  I had no wait issues, but I did go on a Monday morning after 8am.  There is nothing \"fancy\" about this place but it is quaint and laid back with great food!  I highly recommend you give this place a try.  You will not be disappointed with the food!!!",

    "text": "Stopped by this place last weekend at 8am with my girlfriend.  There was only one other table of 3 when we arrived.   We ordered the special which was basically an omelet wrapped around some kielbasa and French Toast with a side of sausage.  We got our coffee quickly but no spoons a creamer with just enough liquid to cover the bottom and no sugar despite asking were precursors to the rest of the meal.  While we waited a couple of more small groups showed up and I scrounged utensils and sugar from other tables and we waited...and waited.  About 20 minutes later we got the special which was cool to the touch.  Thankfully she isn't too picky and made due.  I got french toast...cold...and covered in I think crumbled cornflakes with one link of sausage.  One link of sausage was an additional $2.50.  My meal was cold and the sausage was bright pink when cut into.  I'm an adventurous eater, but when the menu just says french toast I expect a classic rendition not someone's 'take' on it.  I would have ordered cereal if I wanted cornflakes.  We never got a refill of coffee nor our change from the $35 check.  My assumption is that much of our dissatisfaction was due to slow service and the menu lacking clarity.  The price seemed a tad higher than I would expect to pay for the meal even the food was exceptional.",

The menu is simple and I'm sure the hosts will go into detail on all the different ingredients that they make and cook themselves. I got the Belgium waffle with hit fruit compote - so good! But be careful the compote was smoldering!! My husband got the pancakes with maple syrup, he loved it! The bacon was spot on, crunchy and delicious. And the eggs, while really over priced.

Both were inadequate serving sizes for the entire croissant.  Flavor and freshness of the meal was great.  The potatoes served with the omelet selected were flavorful and enjoyable.

When I walked in, it was a small cafe with about 8-10 tables and some patio seating. At first glance, it was a very homey and casual place with local flavor. The menu looked pretty good for all the choices, and I decided to go with green chili omelette with sausage and cream cheese folded in. Very hearty and meaty and a slight spice kick to keep the dish interesting. Coffee was great tasting and not very bitter.  I ordered a daily special chocolate chip brown butter scone and \"rusk\" to take home for the next morning. The scone was massive for what I expected, and it was tasty and flaky. The rusk is basically a very hard biscotti, and it would have been better with hot coffee. I would love to come back when I'm in town.",

As other reviewers indicated, the wait time was a little long but the food was so good. We ordered the French toast and waffles, topped with real whipped cream and fresh strawberries. The French toast was perfection, crunchy on the outside with a custardy texture inside. The waffles (son didn't let me try them) smelled divine. I ordered an omelette with spinach, mushrooms and cheese with rosemary potatoes. Excellent and not greasy as some omelettes can be. I also ordered the house green chile on the side. Yes, it was $2.50 extra, but it was wonderful. The few tablespoons I had left I would have taken to go if we weren't on a road trip. My husband got the Huevos de Madrid with toast. I think he enjoyed it because there was only a sliver of bread crust left.  Our server was multi-tasking but did it in such a way that we didn't feel stressed or forgotten. She was attentive and apologetic of the wait time.  One last item to mention was the coffee. Nothing fancy, I just ordered coffee with milk and sugar. It's just the way I like it, strong but not bitter. Brilliant.   This little cafe is a treasure.",

I ordered the corn beef hash with eggs, not too spicy (I'm a wimp when it comes to spice) and the perfect amount of food. My friend had the omelette, and loved it.   Definitely add this to your breakfast list! For the atmosphere alone, it makes it a unique experience (go for the food too).",

I don't know how this place got rated a single $ but $7 for pancakes is not inexpensive. One of the biggest qualms I had was that they charged $1 for a glass of water. Not a bottle, a glass of water. After I finished it I dared to ask if they did free refills. Who charges for water???  The food was good. But nothing amazing. Definitely not worth the $35 we ended up spending. I think with a 5 star rating from numerous reviews I expected much more and it was a letdown. Upon looking at some of the reviews it seems like many came from people who had only 1-3 reviews so I wish I would've noticed that first.  All in all, not a $ but more a $$.

The waffle, covered in turkey, ham, egg, and Swiss cheese, was so over cooked it was burned black. This burned waffle brick required intensive cutting with a serrated blade.  The burned taste of the waffle overwhelmed the rest of the ingredients, and was unbearable to eat. What does it say about the operation of the kitchen that it would knowingly send out this charred disaster?  A lot, I think. The waitress saw my waffle, heard my complaint and whole heartily agreed. She said she would take care of it and took it back to the kitchen. She never came back and the cook, who I think was either the owner or manager, came out front but never said a word to us. We left in frustration. What does this say about the business?  Enough that I will not return.",

We got there at 9am, there were only 3 other tables of people when we got there. After a few minutes we were seated. We then sat, and sat and sat. We waited over 10 minutes for menus and another 20 minutes of waiting just to put our order in. Our food came after another 30 minutes and was mediocre at best. We had also ordered lattes that sadly did not show up until the end of our meal. I observed 3 dirty tables with dirty plates that sat uncleaned throughout the entire hour and a half that we were there. The staff were unprofessional and did not seem to have any clue as to what they were doing. Food, checks and drinks were being brought to the wrong tables. Then when we asked for our check we waited another 10 minutes and probably would have sat there longer waiting. Instead I went inside and asked if I could pay for the meal. I stood waiting for ANOTHER 10 minutes. Finally the man working gave me my check and asked me how everything was, to which I replied \"It was okay.\" He then got very defensive saying \"Is something wrong?!\" And I replied no, because I didn't want to cause a scene. He then accusingly raised his voice attacking me again saying \"Well if there's something wrong I want you to tell me!\" I signed the receipt and left as fast as I possibly could. I could hear him yelling to me that they were understaffed and had people call in sick. But my god NEVER defend yourself to the customer. What a horrible experience, and a horrible waste of an hour and a half! Save yourself the heartache and the $70! This place SUCKS!",

I loved Alo because its adorable and it wasn't crowded with the Spring Training-already loaded-at-9AM-hipsters. Surely after getting such great reviews that will change, but that's the price of success I guess.   MY food was pretty forgettable, I had a breakfast sandwich, it just looked so sad and lonely on my plate. Pretty meh. But everyone else's breakfast looked amaze-balls and they scarfed it up. My breakfast sandwich was gone pretty fast too...it just wasn't anything to celebrate. Also, not at ALL a fan of that coffee. I drink a lot of coffee and I had no desire to have cup #2. But you know, coffee is pretty subjective...so let me know what you thought.   So if you go: skip the breakfast sandwich, do something else. And keep it a secret, because this place is tiny and the service can't get much more earnest.",

Tucked behind Cornish pasty in a small house with a patio, Alo provides great food and service. Our waitress was attentive and easy going, making for a relaxing morning meal. I ordered the French Toast with a fruit compote and I'm not sure if I'd ever order anything else because it was so delicious. After a couple bites this became one of my favorite breakfast meals I have enjoyed. My girlfriend ordered an omelet with bacon and avocado and that was also quite tasty. I highly recommend choosing this over the nearby Breakfast Club or other more known restaurants in Old Town.",

Anywho, I had a latte, fruit cup, potatoes, eggs, sausage patty & croissant. I won't lie my eyes were bigger than my stomach proportions are well worth the price, so I didn't finish, but sure did take it with me. The potatoes were a little too salty for me, but I fucking love potatoes and fucking love ketchup so that fixed the problem real quick. I don't really eat eggs so I won't give me opinion on those, I guess they were ok. A croissant is a croissant, who fucks up a croissant? No one. The sausage patty was a little salty as well, kind of taste like the potatoes and sausage were cooked in the same pan, but I don't mind it because I do it all the time (; this place reminds me of me cooking at home or waking up at your aunts house and she cooks for you and your cousins lol it's cute & petite and the playlist is really nice! The reason I did not give 5 stars is because it wasn't to die for, but I left very satisfied.",

Steve, the owner, told us recently that he strives to provide \"things you can't find anywhere else around here.\"   He succeeds in spades! Have a delectable breakfast sandwich on an Old Heidelberg roll. Or huevos de Madrid with shrimp and salmon in soft-folded eggs. Or something with a South African sausage! By the way, breakfast is served all day.   Travel the world with lunch if you like. Try tortilla Espanola, or a Milano vegetable wrap, or Jamaican curried rice, or fall back to something more domestic like Sabrett hot dogs from New  York, or Chicago Red Hots, or a Sonoma chicken sandwich.   Desserts are worth a look, even after breakfast! I tried the Kringle one morning, an Estonian dessert bread toasted and buttered just right. Now you try it! I also want to try Hilja's chocolate walnut pie. That could be an amazing breakfast dessert, too, doncha think?   Service is relaxed and smart. For example, Katie, our server on a number of occasions, is a cool, savvy lady. She gives great advice on food choices. She knows how to laugh. She doesn't rush you. And she just returned from an archeological dig in Israel! Remember what I said about an international destination in Old Town?   Hint on how to find Alo Cafe: Walk or drive around behind Cornish Pasty on Goldwater Boulevard and you're there! Parking is at Alo's front door by their cool, shaded patio. Bon voyage!",

    "text": "This is a tough one.  Usually when I'm on the fence, between stars I tend to round up, and I especially try and do this for small businesses like Alo Cafe, but I just can't do that this time.   This is a cute little place. I've gone by it a few times & was curious to try it. A friend of mine had been a few times for breakfast and suggested we meet here. It's small with not a lot of seating, but it was a weekday so we didn't have to wait. It wasn't completely dead though, and the small amount of tables on the inside were all occupied (they have a cute little patio that actually looks like it has more seating than the inside, but it was overcast and drizzling when we were here).  Anyway, I'll just start with the food, because it's good. I had an omelette with potatoes. It was all pretty solid. They bring out this curry sauce that my friend who had been here before said was good with the potatoes, and she was right. They also have SEVERAL hot sauces to choose from it you're into that sort of thing. I like hot sauce on my eggs, but I'm not picky about what kind (I'm okay with plain old Tobasco), so when I asked our waitress if she could bring me a hot sauce I think she was a little taken aback about my \"whatever\" attitude about which one to bring me.  Here's the thing...the service here is slow. Very slow actually (and not very attentive). Luckily, the group of 4 I was with was not THAT bothered by this, but we were a little annoyed. It took us an hour to get our food (2 omelettes, waffle, french toast). Like I said, none of us were in a huge hurry, but waiting that long for breakfast is a little ridiculous (not to mention even when this place is full it's not that big so I don't know how they can get THAT backed up).  Even with the slow service, I'd be willing to be a little more forgiving if our waitress (who was very nice) would have been a little more attentive. After about 30 minutes of waiting I think she realized she needed to check on us a little more with coffee & water refills (prior to this she never came by). I'm okay with waiting when I'm not in a hurry, but at least come by and refill my coffee.  This place is cute, the food is good, but I'm not in a hurry to come back.",

As far as the menu, I love the Waffle Cristo! It's a hearty portion of both waffle and meat, and tastes excellent with an over easy egg on top. I've tried the \"basic\" items such as potatoes and bacon, but I recommend veering away from the normal breakfast items because their menu specializes in unique dishes that cannot be duplicated at your nearby breakfast spots.  Give it a try and be sure to taste something that might not be your typical preference. I promise you will not be disappointed!",

Some of the negatives that kept me from a solid review: the hostess was less than friendly (but our waitress was amazing and made great conversation with us!), the location unfortunately caught the draft of the trash dumpster from the next door restaurant, and when we were finding a table there were 5 or 6 tables that hadn't been cleaned in a long time it appeared so it didn't exactly help me feel like our glasses or silverware were going to be held to a good standard of being clean.",

Alo's has an in-house Curry Ketchup sauce and I was surprised that I really liked it with the potatoes. I added Cholula to the omelette because that's how I roll.  PROS: the food was excellent, decent prices, cozy atmosphere, good variety  CONS: the service was a little hit and miss Overall I would call this a \"hidden gem\" and we are so glad we found it!

It took way too long and when we eventually got our food I found my waffle to be so dense that I actually thought they may have accidentally used bundt cake mix, in addition to that the fruit compote was so thick and covered everything I couldn't lift my fork off my plate without having to use my knife to peel back the melted sugar sauce.

The seating inside was tight but the patio outside had room for days. Since it was chilly we decided to sit inside.   The waitress was very friend and we placed our orders quickly.  My husband had the croissant French toast and I had the scrambled egg whites, potatoes and bacon with multigrain toast and mix berry jam on the side.    We waited 20 mins for our food. I thought it was a little long for simple breakfast food but at least the coffee was good.   Finally the breakfast had arrived and my eggs were yellow not white.... I summoned the waitress and she apologize immediately and gets me scrambled egg white quickly.   I wasn't overwhelmed by the breakfast it was OKAY!! I really wanted to love it like the other Yelpers  but it wasn't happening.   Look I love breakfast and when it tastes lack luster I feel cheated.  I do believe it wasn't the best day for Alo Cafe, so of course I'll give them another try!",

The location seems odd but it's actually so cozy. We will be coming here every time we visit.   Great breakfast!!!",

Overall it was a pleasant visit and one of the best breakfast spots in scottsdale.",

    "text": "When you woke up and didn't know where you were, you wondered where you should go and eat. It was Arizona in the fall, yet you felt that you were in Florida, perhaps Miami somewhere, with all the palm trees and pools and green grass and all. Alo Cafe was not your choice but his. He did all the Yelp research and made the decision without you. In a sun dress you wandered out, using Google map as your guide. The place was busy, the garden patio, which he insisted on sitting in, was filled with early risers by 9:30 am, with only two tables remaining, both had full sun exposure.  You suggested to be indoor, but he insisted on the outside. You realized that you were dealing with a German. Like the time when you were in Heidelberg, Germany, when you were literately melting in the 96 degree weather, your German companions all insisted on sitting in the garden patio, it was the hottest day of the summer and they'd been freezing to death the whole summer.   What is up with Germans and their garden patio seating preference? You wondered as you reluctantly sat down, the sun was beaming happily down, waiting to give you a taste of Arizona or Heidelberg all over again.  Restaurant had international feel to it. You asked for the salmon and shrimp with eggs and potatoes, he settled with the basic eggs and sausage and toast. Sausage was South African. Eggs poached, like you'd see often in Europe, and like you'd order. He and you were two peas in the same pod, eating preference a solid 10 to 10 match.   The sun was migrating towards you, this time it's hitting you straight down, you felt a bit sweaty, at the moment, you wished there we some wind. You could never live in the desert, yet you were enjoying this meal, and this visit in the desert more than you could ever imagine. He insisted on switching seats, he's like that with you, always caring for you, putting your needs before his, making you feel that you were the most important person in the world. He was not affected by the heat, in fact, he downed even more coffee. You've known this man for 18 years, yet this was only the second breakfast you'd shared with him, the first one 17 years ago in Hayes Valley, a German restaurant, where you silently said goodbye to him, though he did not know it at the time.   From where you were sitting, you could see a white cat, licking her paws, and then she just sat there, her green marble eyes staring at you. You wished you knew what the cat was seeing, perhaps streams of sweat that was accumulating at the bottom of your feet. He asked the waitress what was happening in town. You stayed quietly. He's always in charge. With others, you were always the planner, the care taker, the decision maker. But not with him. He took on that role and in return, you could sit back and enjoy the meal. It was delicious. You ate all the eggs and salmon and shrimp, and then you worked on the potatoes. The coffee cups were refilled seamlessly. So did the ice water. Service was superb. The garden was getting more crowded as more people had joined in. The man sitting to the left of him spoke to him, \"Hey, they switched our bills. I guess we both had Amex Platinum cards.\" It's that kind of crowd. Well to do vacationers and locals who loved this place.  This garden and the heat made you remember your recent visit in Heidelberg. Germany is a country you've visited more than any other places in the world, a place you were setting permanent roots in, a place you were now moving to. He was born in Stuttgart. He said when he was young, he would visit the castles in Germany with his grandma. You asked, \"did you like the castle in Heidelberg?\"",

Googled it at a stop light and since this had good ratings on Google, decided to give it a try.  It's a quaint little place nestled in an obscure location.  I totally would have missed it had I not called and the person who answered told me how to get there.  It's a small place that serves Breakfast and Lunch.  The people working there were very nice.  Honestly, I don't remember what I got nor what I ordered for my husband, but they have normal breakfast and lunch stuff, with a twist and some element of South African food on the menu.  I do remember trying some South African sausage and it was delicious.  Will be back some time (most likely for take-out) when I go on another lunch date with my husband at his work.  Want to try more items on the menu and it might be a good place to take our teenagers to enjoy some non-chain food.  All in all, I had a great experience.",

The group I came with echoed my sentiments.   We were the first group in the door that morning so it didn't surprise me that our food came out so fast. Would like to see their speed in the future when the place is busier. Otherwise, highly recommend this cafe and plan on becoming a regular!",

    "text": "Hands-down THE best breakfast (and probably lunch, as they have the original Sabrett hot dog) place in Old Town.   I didn't eat one thing that was not homemade, from scratch, even my corn beef hash looked and tasted like that portion was made just for me (and I think it was).  Steve, the owner, and I wish I could remember the chef's name, are there and more than helpful to tell you where the recipes came from (from NYC where steve was born and raised to Africa and many other parts of the world), what they have in the works for new items, etc. The coffee is Cartel, the bakery items/food is homemade & they have Sabretts;  Not much else to say.  If you want to impress with breakfast, this is the only place to go.  Glad I just moved to the neighborhood.",

This quaint cafe features a diverse menu with many of the sauces and jams house made. I love their strawberry jam--not overly sweet! Alo's make a mean cup of java and has a broad selection of teas and coffee drinks to choose from. Highly recommend the \"make-your-own omelette\"! Nice patio area but too hot outside for my liking, although they do have misters. Indoor seating is limited but fine for groups of two to four people. Downside: water tastes like tap water and the ice melted before it was delivered. Wait staff very friendly and helpful in their recommendations.",

The negatives: we waited nearly an hour for our breakfast to be served (scrambled eggs, toast etc....nothing time intensive), the service was haphazard, my eggs were not cooked to order (I asked for sunny side up, but the yolks came out hard...disappointing after waiting nearly an hour), and my husband found hair on his sausage.  Apparently, the normal cook was out of town for the weekend and the service and quality of food suffered because of it.  I am hoping this was the exception and not the normal experience at Alo Cafe because I really wanted to like this place!",

The Hubs and I had some time to kill on a Saturday morning, so we popped into Alo since it was near an appointment.  There wasn't too many people there, but I can imagine if there was it would feel like a tight fit.  The service was friendly, quick, and helpful.  First off the good, the corned beef hash is amazing.  It was cooked just the way I like it... crispy and soft inside.  There was eggs on the side, and they were cooked to our specifications.  The english muffin it came with was perfect.  Not sure if it was homemade, but it tasted great.  Now for the bad... we got a muffin as well and it was cold and so dense.  Not my fav.  Also, the coffee was so bitter, I could hardly drink any and the half and half curdled in it.  In all fairness, we didn't share our dissatisfaction with the waitress.  She may have corrected these issues, but it really wasn't worth the bother.  I'd say give Alo a try.  It's awesome to support a local business and trust me, the corned beef hash is worth everything else!",
