I'd go back any time for the Sliders.  Actually, the Mile-High Sandwiches looked good too, so I may give one of those a shot.  Update:  I had the Mile-High New Yorker with Corned Beef.  It was not worth $12 for a deli sandwich.  Certainly there's a lot of meat wedged between some rye, but the CB was really stringy.  So much so that it was getting caught in my throat as I was trying to swallow bites...UGH.  That experience dropped the rating from the 4-stars on the Jewish Sliders to 3-stars.",

Deeeelish. Now, that goes for the bagels...not so much for the rest of it.   Our server...umm...had issues. Let's just leave it at that. I would normally say that he was overwhelmed, but it was 3 in the afternoon - so that one is a bit hard for me to swallow (that's what she said, i know). The other thing that was hard to swallow was the food.   I ordered the London Tunnel Sandwich. Sounded yummy...roasted turkey, pastrami, coleslaw, 1000 island - all on yummy rye. Well..not impressed. My advice, just eat the rye with a side of fries. As I was chewing on my sandwich, I had this moment of realization: You are eating a sandwich at Chompies...this is supposed to be knocking you off your chair...especially for 14 bucks. This thought made me choke.   Lesson learned: Buy the bagels and shmear and grab desert on the way out. Save your ass from the uncomfortable seat, your mind from having to deal with dumb servers and your throat/mouth from the uncomfortable feeling of gross food engulfing it.   The end.",

    "text": "First, I want to say from my experience, Chompie's food is very good. Not excellent, but very good.  The service, on the other hand was very poor.  Chompie's is a bit on the expensive side. If there service was good, I might accept that but with poor service, I can't give it higher than 2 stars.   I went to the bakery during lunchtime on Sept. 13th. It was busy so I waited in line like everyone else. As I moved along in line I was asked for my order which included a few bagels, some cookies and a takeout sandwich.  So I'm pulled out of line by one lady who want to ring up my order at this cash register at the stat of the line, not at the end of the line where you usually pay.  I start to take out my wallet and she tells me credit card only, if I want to pay with cash,  I have to get back in line and wait for the OTHER cash register.  O.K. I give her my credit card to pay, but I'm thinking that was annoying.   She tells me my takeout order will be ready soon. It was a simple bagel sandwich.  So I wait, and wait, and wait. 15 minutes later I ask the lady for the status of this, and it turns out the lady never sent the order to the kitchen so of course its not going to be done.  5 more minutes and its finally done.  They need to get a bit more organized and provide better service, or I can tell you I will never be back.  There are too many other good places around to deal with one that couldn't care less about my business.",

Or, the quintessential lox and cream cheese on an everything bagel, toasted, with all the trimmings--slices of red onions, capers, tomato, the works.   But there is none in Yuma.  Thank goodness, Phoenix is just a 2 1/2 hours drive, give and take another half an hour in construction traffic. There a several Chompies in the metropolitan Phoenix area, but we tend to go to the one in Scottsdale, for some other reasons.  * Salmon Lox and cream cheese on an Everything Bagel--quite expensive! But to me, it's a worth an occassional splurge. Though I never paid that much for a bagel sandwich back East, I am grateful that it is relatively closer.  *Matzo ball and chicken soup--the kids and I adore this. The broth is perfect, although on ocassion, I thought it was a tad bit salty. But all in all, still a winner.  * Hubby gets the Pastrami---piled high, good, what else can I say.  I was tempted to shave 2Stars (!) off my general rating--for the fact that service can be sporadic, and on one trip, was downright horrid. The girl ignored us, and we could see her chatting with the other girls (although I'm thinking this happed at the Chompie's on University, and not the one in Scottsdale?).  But to be fair, for the food ALONE--a well desserved 4Star rating from me.   Chopped liver, anyone???",

The combination of the chicken in its seasoned batter plus cheese plus corn plus spicy jalapenos plus waffle plus syrup on top of it all makes a flavor explosion (and later, a slight headache). It was HUGE too - between two people, half of it was still left on the plate.   There is also a large, beautiful display case full of every kind of pastry you can think of. We didn't make it there.

    "text": "If I could give 0 stars I would.  I truly want to love and recommend Chompie's but I can't, even after multiple attempts to provide them with an opportunity for redemption.  This posts is not from one offensive visit but the culmination of living within a 10 minute drive of the restaurant and dining in the restaurant or ordering for pick up at least 6-10 times.    As previous posts note, service is subpar at best.  Too many times have we gone to eat in the restaurant and have received inattentive servers.  If you need something after your food is literally dropped off, you have to waive your server down as they do not come back to check on you.   There was an occasion our food was brought to our table, by a different server, and our original server never came back to check on us.  The next time he came to our table was to bring the bill while we were still eating.  He didn't say anything except dropping the bill on the table.  A not so subtle way to hurry us through our dinner.  I thought this was strange because the restaurant was not busy.  It seemed like there were no servers working, as they must have been in the BOH hiding.   I have provided example of times we dined in so I thought if we picked up food to go, it would alleviate the poor customer service aspect, as we do like the food.  This notion is inaccurate.  We ordered two sandwiches via phone.  When we brought our order back to our office, we noticed our two sandwiches were not remotely close to what we ordered.  When I called to inform Chompie's, I received a combative employee on the other end of the line.  She told me they were busy and it would take at least 45 minutes to correct their mistake.  When I noted, this was an error on their side, she said she could not re-do the order in a more expeditious manner.  That made me feel like they were too busy and we were not important. The last straw for me was from this morning.  I order two bagels to go.  I came into the restaurant and got in line to order.  I saw they were busy because of the upcoming holiday and understood it would take a little longer than usual to receive my food.  Ok.  However, for $10, 20 minutes, and yet, again and inaccurate order, I cannot condone coming here any longer.   When I got home and called, I spoke with two different employees.  The first was understanding and placed me on a hold while she reached out to a manager.  The second employee I spoke to, picked up the phone as if she had no idea why I was calling.  I had to re-explain the story to her, explain why I was frustrated, and received no understanding or apology.   My options were to come back to Chompie's to pick up my correct order or to provide a credit the next time I'm in the restaurant.  How about reimbursing me?  There will be no next time because there have been too many instances of previous times that were not handled correctly.   The food is good but for lack of service and price, there are other East Coast bagel & Jewish delis in the Valley who will go beyond with their food and service.  (Lox Stock & Bagel on the corner of Hayden & E McCormick Pkwy is delicious!)",

Also as with any Jewish deli worth it's salt they provide you with pickles before the meal, and their pickles are awesome. They vary from being really salted and pickled to not so pickled and they give you refills all the time. Also their potato latkas are also pretty good, just make sure to get apple sauce; and everything I have had on their breakfast menu was delicious.  Now the reason for the 4 star review is this place can get busy and when it gets busy the waitresses service is usually not all that great. One time I had to wait an hour for my food (breakfast mind you) and the waitress didn't refill my drink for 45 minutes, I mean I had to flag her down and ask for a refill. Oh well, I try to come here when it's less busy and I would recommend you to as well.",

The food always satisfies.  This service is the worst ever. Table service is usually fairly slow. But today we went to the counter and were served by Haley. I have never seen a more absent-minded, slow server in my life. We ordered one sandwich and a quarter pound of pastrami. After waiting approximately 25 minutes we saw the manager and asked what happened to the sandwich. We were told it was being finished up and then we saw him rush back to slice the meat for the sandwich. He said the sandwich only takes a minute or two to make but no one ever seems to have put in the ticket. They weren't even sure where the sliced pastrami was.  So if you have a lot of time to spare, and I do mean a lot, go to Chompie's and either sit down or get a sandwich to go. But if you are in a rush like we were today, you will be late for your appointment.",

Seriously, this place reminds me of my year in NYC, and it's about as close as you can get in the greater Phoenix area. The sliders are amazing (try the breakfast sliders) and the potato latkas are even better (try them with apple sauce). The bagels are baked fresh, and they have great pastries that they make as well. The service is great, and the best part is that they are not overly busy and have quite a bit of room inside the restaurant.",

    "text": "Soooooo disappointed in Chompies tonight. First we had to wait so long for someone to even acknowledge we were seated. Then when the server came over all he said was, can I get your order? Not, good evening, how are you, any questions, nothing.  We ordered and our food took forever. When we got it, my mom's BLT was soggy and my \"half\" chicken salad looked more like a half of a half with minimal chicken salad. My daughter's pastrami sandwich was so soggy that the bread was just wet. My mom told the server about her BLT, and he was nice about it, and offered to bring her something else. She asked for a grilled cheese. When we received the bill we were charged for the grilled cheese. I'm sorry but if someone complains about the quality of their meal, you give them a new one, and don't charge them! We didn't say anything, we just wanted to leave. I think we will not come to Chompies for a looooong time. The service and the FOOD, has gone down hill so much. Very sad because we used to love this place.  Sorry, Chompies.",

I thought it was a big dining area and they had a big back room that we were able to sit in.   Our waiter was really good and got our drink orders as we sat down. I ordered the Corned Beef Hash Skillet. It was layered with home fries, corned beef hash, cheddar cheese, and scrambled eggs. It came with your choice of bread and I chose the English Muffin. Huge portion. It was pretty good. Thought the hash was good. Very filling. I could barely finished it but somehow managed.   Service was really good. I didn't expect anything else since we were the only tables that early in the morning.  So at 6am there was good service, food was okay but they do serve breakfast all day which is good. I'll be back but have to try their pancakes and French toast. This will tell me if they have good breakfast or not. Enjoy. I did.",

When we mentioned it, the server sympathized and said the manager had locked the controls.  We had to listen for an hour while painfully waiting for the breakfast order.  Last night we tried again for dinner.  It was 6 pm and only two tables were occupied - probably because the rap music was horrible.  Usually the place is jumping and waiters are practically running to meet serving demands.  I looked around and did not see any of the regular staff that had waited on us for years. The new employees, with nothing to do, were standing around, joking and playing games. Something tells me there is a new sheriff in town and he is not one of the good guys.",

We went when our daughter was a baby. She couldn't sit up on her own well yet so we brought her portable feeding chair. We needed to feed her a bottle and I didn't want her laying in her car seat. The host initially refused to seat us because we had the feeding chair, which would easily strap to the chair. He was insisting she go in a high chair and I explained she could sit on her own and we had been there before with this chair and it was not a problem. Then he said fine, but there is a wait. We watched as he sat everyone coming in and not us. Then my husband checked and he never added our name to the list. He had no intention of seating us and let us stand there like idiots with our baby. We walked out and called. We spoke with a manager who couldn't be bothered with our complaint so we haven't really been back since then. We went back maybe once or twice, but the experience left us pretty irritated. Otherwise, I think the food is good and outside of that incident, we never had bad service.",

We have been back to this location several times and the service has been improving.  Today is a good example.  I came by for a Baker's Dozen around noon time. It was a madhouse! Folks standing everywhere waiting to be seated.   But, I was in and out within ten minutes or so.  David was directing traffic from behind the counter and doing a very good job.  BTW, it was only $9.42 for those thirteen bagels/ bialys!  So, so much better than the ones at Fry's and almost as good as New York Bagels 'N Bialys.  The major drawback continues to be their slower period around dinner time.  Like I said it's getting better. I guess if you've been on your feet for 5/6 hours and things slow down; you look for an opportunity to catch your breath.    The food is very good, lets say Four Stars.  Service is Three Stars-ish.  And that New York kvetching?  Priceless!  Enjoy!",

Firstly they were out of corned beef hash.  Have you seen the breakfast menu?  It's 75% corned beef hash!  How do you allow this to happen? Latkes another favorite of mine, had so much flour in it that it was difficult to see the shreded potato. The bialy was gummy, doughy pale and  thick. I admit I ate the entire mess because I was starving and didn't have the time to go elsewhere. I have never experienced this at chompies.  Nor have I ever complained about the prices before. I will pay anything for good food. When I decide to dine out I eat well! The service was good and fast. The staff were kind and responded with sincere concern. I may try chompies again but I am reluctant. Sad, it was a great place.",

We the asked if we order \"to go\", if we could sit on the patio to eat. You would have thought we were asking for the moon. To make a long story of terrible service shorter, after waiting a half hour to get an order that was cold and incomplete, we had to beg for silverware and and napkins - they obviously resented our use of the patio and did everything possible to \"punish\" us for our decision.   Their strategy worked; we not only regretted sitting outside, but choosing this restaurant in the first place- we will NEVER make that mistake again.

Going into NYC just wasn't an option each time I wanted some half sours and a knish.   It took moving to Scottsdale, AZ to find a solution - go figure.  The gigantic menu you'd expect, pretty good bagels, great breads, not to mention the grilled cheese/Jewish sliders/patty melt/kosher dog with kraut/knish/fresh chips/potato salad/macaroni salad - all are awesome.  I did not care for the Reuben I tried, however, I am crazy picky about corned beef and I realize that a True NY deli serves the meat a little fatty so that's my hangup.  Husband had an omelet today that could have fed 4 people - he loved it.   If you are going to Chompies with someone and it is their first time, force them to look at the menu online first or you will be filling up on half sours for some time as they decide.

Please don't read too much into reviews with people complaining about any 'bad service' they've received. Sure, it happens sometimes. It happens every where, in fact. That is inevitable.

The last time I went I had the Monte Cristo which was huge and wonderful. It is one of those weird sandwiches with ham, jam, and the bread is fried with powdered sugar on top. Sweet & savory in one go! I had to eat it with a knife and fork because it was way too huge to try and pick up with my hands.  I ate about a quarter of it at that time, took the rest to go.. had about 1/4 of it after chorus, and then finished the rest the next morning driving back down to Tucson... I thought it held up quite well!  I love that that give you a plate of pickles to 'chomp on' while you look at the menu and wait to order.    They boil their bagels, and according to my friend who used to run a bagelry in Tucson, that is the best!   Since going there, my diet is changing to plant-based and low-wheat options, and I know their menu can accommodate many \"XYZ-Free\" diets/lifestyles, so am looking forward to seeing what I will have next time.",

Had about 50 minutes alloted before my Mayo clinic appointment, so I thought a short stack of banana-nut pancakes would get me in and out fast.  I thought wrong.  Staff was friendly enough, but it took at least 10 minutes for the server to finally take my order.  I asked for banana-nut pancakes, but instead of the pancake syrup (not pure maple), I wanted a side of the blueberry compote that usually comes w/ the blueberry pancakes.  Would this be OK?  Server said yes.  The short stack (2 cakes) arrived 15 minutes later, but instead of banana-nut pancakes, these were blueberries, delivered by another server.  My server came by to ask if I needed anything else, heard my complaint, and rushed back to the kitchen to correct it.  I was assured that it would only take 10 minutes to get a fresh batch out, but another 15 minutes went by before the correct order arrived.  Keep in mind, it's already been at least 40 minutes since I sat down.  I only had 10 minutes to spare- not enough to savor these delicious cakes.  The blueberry compote ended up containing corn syrup, the ingredient I was trying to avoid by not using the pancake syrup, but it's hard for me to resist blueberry compote, so if I must suffer...  I most likely will visit Chompie's again the next time I'm out and about and craving for pancakes, but only if I have 90 minutes or more to spare...",

I was introduced to Chompies at the spring fling at their Glendale location and instantly fell in love *cue the violons* ;)  They make their own mustard and pickles as any legit deli should. No Guldens or generic spicy mustard will disgrace my pastrami on rye sandwich! Lololol  While I was there I noticed their bagel game was spot on! People were loading up bagfuls!!!!  Another thing I noticed is the menu is overwhelming not only to some customers and staff members I met in both locations I've been to so far. With that said I wonder if the company would be more profitable and in turn have better customer service if low selling items for each location are nixed from the everyday menu (maybe offer them as monthly specials or promotions)???  I also tried some sweet treats: *peanut butter/chocolate gluten free brownie - moist and delicious!!! *biscotti - meh, just ok *Mexican wedding cookies - did not enjoy *laceys - good  As others have already mentioned *sigh* service can be spotty depending on if you are not a regular, aren't dining in, did not order ahead or you just get a new person. But, since the food quality is exceptional I'm willing to overlook it.  During this visit I didn't want to bug the take out staff again so I asked one of the gals on the sit down restaurant side for a side of their wonderful mustard and she was so gracious enough to get me a side so I could thoroughly enjoy my sandwich. That customer care bumped my 3.25 experience up to a 4.  High Yelp marks or not I hope Chompies will have continued success and hopefully open new locations in the future!",

I had the opportunity to study the menu very well (it had been a while since my last visit) I had the Jewish Slider combo. The brisket sliders on challah were delish. I actually took out the potato pancake because it made it too big to eat. This actually allowed me to savor all the flavors! For my soup I chose the mushroom beef and barley, which was my favorite growing up. My friend had the Matzo ball soup and half a Rueben. We left no crumbs. The service was great! One thing I missed was the pickles!  I'll be back Chompie's!",

My hopes and spirit of ordering a nice LOX on bagel were crushed, however, when I literally stood at \"Order Here\" area for 5 or 7 minutes. I witnessed 4 staff members behind the bar (by deli case at far end) monkeying around. I totally understand if there's a deli crisis down there, but jeez - make eye contact w/me, tell me \"one minute\", or even \"get lost\" - something! Throw me a bone, Chompie's!  The guy behind me gave up and left. I hung in there for a few more minutes. Finally, I gave up as well, as it truly boiled down to: Erin being late for work w/a Lox Bagel and some unnecessary guilt, OR Erin being on time for work (something I do pride myself on...) sans any Lox or bagel w/a clean conscience. I chose the latter, obvi.  I may return or I may not. Disappointing.",

The matzo ball soup is also really good. If you like a deep fried monti cristo sandwich, they do that too. Last time we got the chicken livers as an appetizer, and I'd have to say that I like the stuff at Don & Charlie's a bit better.   I've been going to this location for the over 15 years (they even catered my bar mitzvah back in 1996) and I don't think anything has changed. The mural on the wall is beginning to look like a time capsule. I think the only thing that frequently gets updated is the menu. They also have an interesting frequent diner thing now, but I haven't figured that out yet.  Get a cookie from the bakery before you leave because they're just as good as the food.",

    "text": "Wow...have been a fan of Chompie's for years now. But with our experiences yesterday...don't think I'll be going to the Shea Scottsdale location anymore - it's a shame too because the place is a 5 minute walk from me.  *Disclaimer: review is based on service only. I know a lot of people are sticklers for customer service, especially when the place is good, not great. Usually, great food overshadows poor service. But Chompie's is good/maybe great food in comparison to other Phoenix restaurants and delis...definitely not great food compared on a larger, metropolitan scale.  We were traveling from Chicago to Phoenix yesterday and were wondering what we would be eating for Christmas dinner considering we had no food at home. We called Christmas Day afternoon before our flight took off to confirm holiday hours and menu offerings and the woman who answered the phone was incredibly rude and hung up on us. Thinking the restaurant was probably slammed and she was stressed, we let it slide.   We called later in the evening, around 7:45 when our flight had landed to place an order for pick up while we were getting our car to head back home (home again is less than a half-mile from Chompie's Deli) and the woman who answered rudely informed us that she would not take the order over the phone. We would need to place the order in the restaurant but she did matter-of-factly inform us that there was a 30 minute delay with take out orders and that the restaurant closed at 9 pm sharp. And then, of course, she hung up on us when we were asking other questions.  I get it, they are a Jewish Deli and one of only a handful of restaurants open on Christmas Day, but the quality of your service and food is best judged when you are at your busiest.   FYI We ordered Chinese take-out last night...and I cannot stand Chinese food.",

We thought we would give it a try and we were excited to see it was not very full of patrons (if you go to Chompie's for breakfast, you know the controlled chaos that surrounds the dining room).    It took forever to get our drinks ordered, and when we go our drinks our server dropped them and left before we could order our appetizer.  When we finally were able to order our server kept cutting us off.    Our food came over a half hour after we ordered it, and well after 2 other tables that came in after us were served. I am convinced our server forgot to put in our order.  Then on the way out we stopped at the bakery.  It took close to 10 minutes to get someone to help us.  The night hostess had to go to the back and make someone come out and help us and another customer.  We will definitely go back for dinner, but I'm making sure we won't be in that servers section again.",

    "text": "LOVE Chompie's!!! Probably one of my favorite places in Scottsdale for casual eating.  My friend and I go every Saturday mornings after hiking with the dogs. Obviously since we bring the pups we sit outside. I have to say, I am shocked at reading about the terrible service. In the three years I have gone here at least once a week, we have never had terrible service. There is one waiter who I don't think likes serving the patio people (or maybe it's just us dog people) but everyone else is amazing. We're barely there for 5 min and they are out with water bowls for the dogs, coffee for me, and a diet coke for my friend.   On to the food. It's thanks to Man vs Food, and my mom, that I found Chompie's. She had seen the episode and since I was moving to Phoenix, she wanted to try. Now every time she visits we have to go at least twice. She has gotten everything from french toast to reubens to chicken and waffles --  and she's loved it all. Her favorites are the sandwiches because they are enough food for 1-2 more meals!! Having celiac's disease, I have to go with what's on the GF menu, but I still love it. My go-to is the GD Bagel w/lox platter. It is so yummy and filling. The rare times I don't get that, I will get the reuben or GF waffles. The pups always get their plate of bacon.  Chompie's is now carrying a variety of GF deserts and pastries, which I love!! My non-gf friend and I will occasionally split a chocolate and peanut butter brownie. I'm lucky I have the dog or I would go in before I left and buy more for home.  Well that it is. We'll be at Chompie's with the danes tomorrow for our post hike brunch like we are every weekend!",

The hot brisket was ice cold and tasteless.  And the gravy clotted.    Not going back!",

    "text": "So having landed at Phoenix Sky Harbour and waiting for my connection out to Prescott, I was asked very nicely if I as a lone traveller would consider being bumped off the flight to allow a guy to get back home to see his sick kid. I was more than happy to oblige and as I'm out her for 6 weeks or so an extra few hours really don't mean that much. So with a $30 gratuity from the airline I thought, what shall I do?  An then the idea occurred to me that I wasn't all that far from Chompies deli in Scottsdale, a place I've wanted to try for a while.  I hopped in a cab an headed into deepest darkest Phoenix!  So Chompies is a New York style Deli and I believe they now have 4 venues in the Phoenix area., I wanted to visit this one as its the only one I'd ever known anyone visit. This place was made a little famous when it featured on Man v Food. Id' heard about it prior to that show but it was seeing on there that planted the seed for me to actually make an effort to go.  Okay, this on appearance is just a regular deli and on entry I was greeted warmly. I was shown to a booth and presented with the menu. Now when you look around the place you soon realise that the portion sizes are generous even by US standards.  The menu has plenty of choice sandwiches, burgers bagels and traditional Jewish food too. There's also a kids menu which I have to say sounded pretty good and there was a dedicated gluten free menu too.  I picked Bobs Brisket from the Colossal Reubans section of the menu priced at $14.99 you would be forgive for thinking its a little pricey. However when it arrives it is huge, and I mean huge! It was full of flavour, tender meet, perfect onions and beautiful seasoning. Having seen the size of it I was glad I didn't order a side of wedges billed on the menu as 'full portion sides'.  Chompies is the home of Chompies slider challenge which was featured on Man v Food. Its essential 12 sliders filled with brisket, mini potato pancakes and Jack cheese served with gravy and 5lbs of onion strings. Many have tried few have succeeded. At $39.95 its actually pretty good value, and would certainly be worth having as a sharer.  I loved this place, the food was great, the atmosphere great and the prices reflected excellent value, my sandwich and a coke came to $22 (inc tip).",

I hadn't been to Chompies in years, as I went there once years ago with my mom and we sat at a table in the corner for 30 minutes with no service (no one brought water, nothing) until we finally left. Recently, I visited the PV location and the service was quick, the food was delicious, and I was nothing short of pleased. After an appointment yesterday I wanted to go, and realized we were closer to this location, so we went. The table seated next to us after us received help at least 10 minutes before we were helped, and when we were helped we did not get the customary table pickles. I asked my waitress for iced tea, as I had heard the gentleman at the table next to us order some, and he was given an option of multiple different teas, but my waitress left immediately after I said \"iced tea,\" not giving me the option to choose. Our food came quickly but our orders were wrong (my mom's egg white omelette was not just egg whites) and my omelette with chorizo had very little chorizo in it. The home fries, my favorite part, included ~3 potatoes, and clearly was the bottom of the pan. The waitress never came back to fill our drinks and had to be flagged down for our check once we had grown impatient after being ignored for so long. Next time I will go out of my way to PV instead. As we left, the waitress walked right past us with no \"thank you\" or \"goodbye.\"",

    "text": "We used to like Chompie's, and don't get me wrong the food is still okay, but this location is getting pretty long in the tooth.   We stopped by yesterday on the way home from Mayo Clinic on Shea. My partner had a test scheduled for 12:30 PM and couldn't eat anything before the test. Needless to say by the time he was done at 2:00 he was very hungry and unfortunately didn't feel well after the test.   I figured Chompie's would be our best bet. He has always liked their food, especially the soup and that's something we could get quickly. Despite my previous review I've always had mixed feelings about Chompie's. It's always been a little pricey, the service can be spotty, I find the employees to be somewhat negative and condescending but the food is usually good. This visit didn't reinforce any of the positive thoughts I've had about them.  The server came by right away and took our drink orders and shortly thereafter took our lunch order. We both ordered Mish Mosh soup, one of our favorites and as expected it came right away and it really hit the spot.  The unfortunate thing about this location is that it has become terribly rundown. The carpet in the dining area is filthy, the tabletops are worn out and in general the place smells pretty bad. Not very appetizing. C'mon Chompie'sfor the prices you charge you can afford to take a little of your profits and give this place a makeover!  Next time we'll go to the location closer to home at Paradise Valley Mall.",

Wasn't like it was steak and eggs, anything mega-fancy, etc. And, we asked for re-fills on the ice teas, and actually had to get up, go to the drink station ourselves and grab our own re-fills after waiting ten minutes. Then, after breakfast, my Wife wanted to get a few bakery items, and it was like pulling teeth to try and get someone to help us... When they weren't even that busy. Bottom line is that I don't mind spending money when you get what you pay for, but overpriced, mediocre food, combined with BAD service, makes me think I shall not be returning here any time in the near future.",

The logo enticed me so I decided to try it out.  I first stood in the door way for about two minutes before anyone even acknowledged me. I was then seated at a table in a back corner, which was fine with me. The waiter was definitely rushing around, but he was nice enough. I ordered a bowl of chicken soup and a dinner salad and I was disgusted. The chicken soup was just broth and noodles and one single big hunk of chicken. About half the size of a regular chicken breast. I was grossed out to find this big chunk of chicken to be the only chicken in the soup. Then I was brought my dinner salad and it was just some browning iceberg lettuce with some cheese, unripe tomatoes, and cucumber slices on top.  I feel that my order was so simple, that it should've been hard to make it bad. I can definitely say that I will not be back.",

Chompie's is a traditional Jewish deli; expensive, huge portions, huge menu and delicious looking pastries.  I ordered a monte cristo, which was fabulous, and my husband had a reuben which he thoroughly enjoyed.  Of course we had to test the Jewish slider that Adam ate on the show, to the tune of $4 a pop!  He had to eat 12 of them in under 30 minutes and after trying 1/2 of one, there is NO WAY I could do that!  It was super delicious but far too filling.    The service at Chompie's was great, especially once they heard we were doing a Man vs. Food roadtrip.  Our server was attentive and friendly and she even sent the manager over to say hi and we chatted with him for awhile. He very kindly bought us desert and sent us on our way with a huge pack of bagels and cream cheese for breakfast in the motorhome.  The bagels were fabulous!  We had to freeze some and are still eating them.",

I have only been to this location one or two other times prior to this last visit (and it/they were both a LONG time ago), but I have been to the Tempe one from time to time when I'm in town for a visit & despite the different layouts (for some reason this one \"feels\" more like a Jewish deli), the food & service at both locations are similar.  I don't like pickles at all, but it's nice that they put them out at your table like some restaurants do w/bread, chips/salsa, etc...  The menu here is HUGE and breakfast is served all day, which I like. Last time I was here I had a chorizo & cheese omelet, and it came w/home fries (I think I could have substituted them for fruit or cottage cheese, but I was on vacation) and a bialy (can substitute w/bagel, English muffin, or toast). This was a TON of food. The omelet & homes fries were a bit greasy, but hey, they were good. I do LOVE that Chompie's serves bialies!   The service here can be a bit slow, but nothing TOO much worth complaining about. At the end of the day Chompie's is a solid spot.",

This is more like Jewish soul food restaurant where people bring their families for lunch or dinner or just simply meet friends for lunch and play mahjong in the back room.   Our waitress was kind of in hurry or rushing when she took our order (maybe she didn't write it right or she didn't listen what we ordered), in result we didn't get the food what we wanted.  I ordered chicken & matzo ball soup with halla bread and came out in chicken noodle soup with think crispy bagel. I was like where is my matzo ball soup and my halla bread, ha..,ha....now I have chicken noodle soup with matzo ball in it which was good for hungry belly. The halla bread was good as well.  My mother in law had stuffed cabbage, but I think it was too sweet for my taste. My husband ordered tongue sandwich with coleslaw and again came out with French fries instead, ha....ha.....,  It was nice that with yelp check in, we got 1 free black and white cookie, it was ok flavor but hey it's free.

I visited there Shae location and waited over 15 minutes and no one brought me a water, took my order for a drink, or even acknowledged my presence. The waitress even served the table right next to me and walked away. Perhaps they were too busy? No, there were  probably only four other occupy tables besides me. When I got up to leave, I explained to the hostess how nobody waited my table. She sweetly apologized, and wished me a good day.

The turkey was more edible than the roast, but both were extremely dry. If the roast beef wasn't leftover from 2 day's ago I'd be shocked. Putting condiments on the sandwich didn't even help! Overall, after 3 bites I actually threw it away and went out to get something else. If this is the way they conduct the catering business, I can't say I'd ever get it again no less go into the restaurant to eat.",

I stopped on my way home from work and bought a quart of chicken noodle soup, a half of corned beef sandwich, a creme brulee, 2 bagels and a loaf of rye. With tip this cost me almost $40. I asked for extra lean on the corned beef sandwich but I have no idea if she heard me or whether I was charged for it, because I didn't get a receipt. BOY was I disappointed when I got home with my food. The corned beef sandwich was REALLY FAR from lean; it was rubbery, fatty, and almost slimy with fat. We threw away the entire sandwich. (10.99 for a half sandwich that went right in the garbage.) So we moved on to the soup. Let me tell you, Campbell's would have been better. It was flavorless, mushy, and the chicken was sort of gross. (I pulled one chunk out that was all gristle, skin and purple stuff.) This also got dumped straight down the drain, for $8.99. So that's $20 for food that was throw away. The creme brulee was actually really tasty, which is why this is 2 stars instead of one. I haven't eaten the rye bread or bagels, but they both seem fine.  OH! And even the pickle basically just tasted like a cucumber that had barely been pickled.  EDIT: I ate one of the \"cragels\" the next morning and it was raw in the middle. :|",

Dine ins are great, the food is always excellent.   I've been ordering take out lately and there's always been a problem with my order.   I get the Cabo skillet with homefries, and they keep not including the salsa and sour cream condiments. Today, I didn't get the melted jack cheese on my skillet, which completely killed the meal for me and was the last straw, which is why I'm writing this review.   They also made my home fries hash browns instead, which were underseasoned and undercooked .  Quite a shame because I get nothing but the cabo skillet and its usually been excellent without any of these problems when I dine in.   I ordered a different skilled and asked for scrambled eggs, instead I got overcooked fried eggs which also killed the entree.   I'm going to give them another chance next week, and if the same problem presists I'll probably stop eating here again.",

The wait staff know the large menu well and make good recommendations on a variety of foods that are offered. The deli is stocked with fresh traditional meats and cheeses. There are Jewish deli favorites like hot brisket of beef and pastrami, sliced to order. *knishes, pirogies, potato pancakes, etc. The bakery offers desserts and pastries like cheesecake, carrots cake, red velvet, German Chocolate cake, Tiramisu and, my personal favorite Cannoli's. There are many varieties of breads and bagels to choose from, lo carb and gluten free as well. In the restaurant they have fresh mile high sandwiches and homemade matzo ball soup, and my 2 personal favorites the homemade corned beef hash and their incredible Jewish Sliders. They have a little something for everyone from southwestern style items to ones that offer something for the health conscience patrons. Chompie's is an Arizona treasure, with its fresh deli sandwiches and fresh bakes breads and pastries. If you're ever nearby stop in for a bite to eat and treat yourself to one of the best meals you'll ever have.",

    "text": "Disappointed in our service today. The food was good, no issues with the food. As soon as people were seated, everyone was given a delicious looking blueberry coffee cake, but we never received any. We were about to ask for ours when our food showed up, so we decided what we had in front of us was enough.  My wife had a terrible time getting a refill on her tea. Her glass was completely empty before our breakfast arrived. There was a lady walking around making sure everyone had coffee refills and saying hi to all the tables (she said she was the manager). She said hi to all the tables around us except for ours. We kept hoping she would say hi so we could also ask for a refill, but she never looked at us nor did our server notice my wife's empty cup after walking around us for a good 20 minutes. After we were finished eating, the server came back to get our plates and finally asked my wife if she wanted a refill on her tea. At this point we were leaving, so she was just drinking my water.  I couldn't help but notice how friendly they were to most of the tables, but they never once said hello, thank you, or good bye to us. I know we are not regulars, but being friendly to everyone is a good way to make new regulars! We couldn't help but feel like maybe a small part of it was that we are a gay couple?",

Today, one of the regulars got my bagel ready, but a different person rang me up. Charged me more than what I've been getting charged. When I questioned, the person got offended and would hear nothing of it, just kept quoting me the new price. If I'd been getting some special price for the past few weeks, how was I to know, I was just paying what I'd asked, now I get a 33% increase and am not supposed to question it?   I'm just asking for some courtesy and consistency.   *************  The food is good as are the portion sizes but the prices are high. service leaves a little to be desired.   Stopped in today for a bagel and coffee. Ordered an untoasted bagel with light veggie cream cheese, received a toasted with plain. Was not busy, the counter person just flat out ignored my request.  Don't even think of calling the dark water they serve, coffee. Weakest cup of Joe I've had in the Valley.",

    "text": "Chompie's is a well known, NY style restaurant & bakery, so I'm not breaking any new ground here... but as an ex-New Yorker living in Southern California, it was a natural for me to want to try it while on vacation with my family in Scottsdale, AZ.  We stopped off twice during the week... once for lunch and a second time for breakast before driving out of town  (because we liked it so much).    LUNCH: First off I have to compliment them on having HALF-SOUR PICKLES on the tables.  I miss this from delis back in NY.  It's hard to find them on the west coast.  For lunch my wife ordered their famous sliders (yes, the ones on the Man vs. Food challenge) although she only ate one of them.  They were very tasty though.  I had the Pastrami Reuben which I liked very much.  My mother-in-law had some Matzah ball soup... to be honest I didn't care for that very much... (and yes, I grew up with it and know good matzah ball soup). My daughter had the sauteed perogies which were very good too.  My sons had burgers.... they liked them, but then again, they're just burgers.  We also had a side of onion straws which were OK.  Overall the food was good though.  We also picked up some bagels, knishes and italian pastries for the hotel room since we were going to be there all week.  The deli counter looked fantastic: more pickles, cream cheese spreads, fish (salmon & whitefish) and salads.... as well has hebrew national salamis.  I felt like I was almost back in NY.  The bagels were good...but then again, after spending the past 8 years out of New York... any bagel had to be better then what I get in California.  I had a potato & onion knish later that night... it was awesome.  Just like in a new york kosher deli.  BREAKFAST: We came back on Saturday morning for breakfast.  breakfast sliders, bagels & lox, pancakes, etc.  All were very good.  My \"All Salmon\" bagel (with cream cheese, lox & nova, capers, onions & tomato) hit the spot.  Very good.   My ONLY complaint is that we sat in the back room.  It had an awesome mural on the wall of some of the great New York Yankees (which I LOVED) ... From right to left was Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Mickey Mantle, Roger Maris, Reggie Jackson and Don Mattingly.....  My complaint?  Where's JOE DiMAGGIO??  Really?  Ok.  A very minor gripe from a True Yankee fan. :)  Man Vs. Food:   Adam Richman was here for the \"Ultimate Slider Challenge\".  He didn't win.  But there is a small wall towards the back of the restaurant which is the \"Wall of Fame\".  I took a pic of my youngest son there as he LOVES that show and always thinks that HE can win the challenge.  Maybe someday.... but there was no way he was going to eat all those sliders.   Bottom line?  Chompies is a must stop in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "It has to be eons since we've been to Chompie's for Sunday brunch, or any other meal for that matter. When we first moved to Scottsdale seven and half years ago, Chompie's was our go-to place . . . it didn't matter if we wanted breakfast, lunch or dinner.  Personally, I could eat breakfast for all my meals anyway so Chompie's fits the bill perfectly for me. But we tired of it after probably four years and thousands upon thousands of calories . . . so we gave it a rest, a two and a half year rest. And the funny thing is . . . now having gone back for brunch, I think I could put Chompie's back on our regular go-to rotation.  Some things have changed since we were last there, but all for the good . . . new upholstery, new look to the menu, new carpet . . . but the same faces are still there . . . and the good old standby items are still on the menu . . . Service on this particular Sunday at 11 am was brisk, polite, friendly. The coffee refills came on time without even asking. If I had any complaints, it was that the napkins are a little thin for such huge and sometimes messy meals and they neglected to set out place with knives.    My French omelet was divine, cooked perfectly.  I asked for the onions to be almost overcooked and they were, and my eggs were soft. If there is the slightest bit of brown on my omelet, it's a minus sign in my book. I usually can't finish a 3-egg omelet, but this was so delicious, I almost finished it -- okay, I left one bite. The home fries were also yummy, some a little charred, just the way I like it.  My hubby had the Long Island Expressway Skillet which came with plenty of Nova Lox, cheese, mushrooms, onions, scallions and potatoes. Loved it!  As were were approaching the restaurant an older couple in a car rolled down the window, said they were from out of town visiting and asked where Goldman's was located . . . I said, you are in Chompie's parking lot, stay here, you'll love it . . . it's an experience!  Somehow I made it past the bakery without buying a thing! Everything looks so pretty. They even have high-heel shoe pastry.  That was new to me! I'm sure we'll be back soon and I won't be able to control my urges.  Thanks, Chompie's, for reminding me of what I was missing . . .",

We were seated right away and the host brought us a highchair right away as well. (You'd be surprised at how often that gets neglected when we go out so I appreciate it!) He also asked if our son would like crayons and brought a kids menu for him to color. Thanks again!  The breakfast menu is EXTENSIVE! I ordered the Breakfast of Champions: 2 pancakes, eggs, and turkey sausage. We ordered the kid's french toast for my son and my husband ordered the Chompie's Breakfast Sliders. We were all happy with our food. My husband's breakfast sliders were huge and looked delish! My only complaint was that the middle of my pancakes were still doughy, but other than that the food was good. The server was very attentive and pleasant and everything was reasonably priced. We'll definitely be back!",

    "text": "OPEN LETTER: Dear Chompie's Management:   Last night, Saturday, March 11, 2017, I went to your restaurant rather late and bought a loaf of Sesame Challah Bread.  I gave it to my husband to enjoy with a bit of honey which he loves as a dessert.  When he took his first taste, he immediately told me that the bread was not fresh.  He closed up the loaf in its packaging and placed it on the counter.  I checked for an expiration date and it had none which is unusual since your packaged goods usually have a date.    Next morning at about 7:30 am, I went to your restaurant to exchange the loaf.  I explained the situation to an older gentleman at which point he became very annoyed.  He put his hands on the loaf and said to me \" It feels fresh to me\".  I could have given him a sarcastic answer such as \"Then, you eat it.\"  but I bit my tongue out of respect.  I would have gladly done an exchange but his behavior prompted me to get a refund instead.  He began to write up a slip with my name and phone number, throwing the pen toward the cash register when the ink in the pen wasn't flowing fast enough for him---throwing a virtual tantrum.   I am a long time customer of Chompie's.  I shop there every other day for danishes and baked goods.  Why would I be treated like this?  So nasty.  I hope he is not one of the owners because it doesn't bode well for the restaurant.   I suggest that you treat your customers with respect even if they have a complaint.",

I spoke with him and he was amazing, he apologized, seemed genuinely disappointed with his server, and didn't go overboard with winning us back. We had an issue with one meal, so he comped it.

The Challenge: Chompie's \"The Ultimate Slider Challenge.\"  ...12 Original Jewish Sliders: each one brisket-filled and gravy-drizzled, stacked as well with mini potato pancakes, Jack cheese, and onion strings.  Knock this 5-pound nemesis on its ass within 30 short minutes, and you rule the stoop, my friend!  Myself, I don't entertain delusions: I'm weak.  I didn't even consider the Challenge.  Instead, I ordered the Combo.  And after tearing through an incredibly tasty two, alongside a cup of Matzo Ball soup, I was full.  Adam, however, he Manned-up!  Sadly, though, after a hard-fought battle, he--as many have before him--ultimately threw in the towel. The Challenge, it seemed, proved too hefty.  Food had won.  ...However, if one, brave soul decides to accept this heaping challenge ($39.95) and conquers this plattered beast, it's free.  But not only that: upon winning, you will be forever immortalized on Chompie's \"Hall of Fame\" website (<a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fchompies.com%2Fwall-of-fame%2F&s=32f56f139a6c8512baad7df3e6a91b281bc38ffa8dc0dd3f4140597d954e964f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">chompies.com/wall-of-fame</a>) and an \"Ultimate Slider Challenge\" T-shirt awaits you and your bragging self!! You bad!!  (By the way, there's no California representation on that website, zero, none, not one, nada...  Who'll step up?  This having been my first time to Chompie's, I was truly impressed!  A Yelp check-in offer allowed for a free bagel from their awesome deli/bakery; our very cool server, Trudy, brought out a few, free cookie samples for this first-timer; and our just-as-cool host made lunch suggestions, which we ordered verbatim.  As promised, those Sliders were \"deli-icious.\"  And the Matzo Ball and Chicken soup hit the spot.  But I couldn't leave...not yet.  As full as I was, I couldn't head back to CA without first trying the carrot cake, could I?  I mean, you don't blame me, right?  So, \"Man vs Food\"...

Portions are huge, service is friendly and they have a great rewards program which earns you Chompie's bucks to use towards your next meal.  Whenever I'm there I want to try everything but I can't say no to the Arizona Benedict (eggs benedict but with turkey, avocado and tomatoes).  Their potato cakes (latkes) are also delicious.  They also have a great dinner menu and I usually get their sliders although we don't really go there for dinner very often.    Don't forget to check in on Yelp and receive a free bagel of your choice when you purchase an item at the take out deli!",

    "text": "Well, not exactly 'yay', I'm a fan, but we had a good experience this time.  Portions are massive. Food was good. Service was good too. Our server did not seem very knowledgeable, I am not sure if she was new, but she was good. Also, I liked how servers teamed up to take good care of customers. Neighbor had the Lox bagel with cream cheese and I have been craving that ever since :( Hubby had the chompadilla and he thought it was OK, he liked the seasoned potatoes very much.  I had a cheese omelette with mushroom and artichokes. It was really good. The con is that I only wanted an omelette (cheaper of course) but they were not very accommodating so apparently I had to order the whole whatever combo with potatoes and bread.  The other matter I did not like is that, we stopped there in the first place because I had a reward that I wanted to use, but when the server returned she said I did not.  Later on I received a 'welcome' text from their rewards club. Oh well, either they messed up, or they have separate rewards accounts for each location, which is not in fact very practical, so that was a big disappointment.  I liked this location a little better, the layout is similar to the old location on Greenway and 32nd.",

However, I just do not think the food is very good and horribly overpriced.  Service was terrible as usual. Who brings a bill without once checking on your customer or asking if they need or want anything else? I had to ask two other servers for drink refills. Meh!",

However the customer service is HORRIBLE. When waiting to order our pastries, we tend to wait around 10 mins for an employee to notice us or even come towards us at the counter to take our order. We have been ignored and skipped over many times by employees and I don't know why. I really don't want to pull a race card here but when I go in with my father, which is of darker complexion, we are always looked over or the employee goes and helps other customers of lighter complexion first. However when I go in with my mother, which is lighter in color, we get helped within 3 minutes. I've ignored this treatment many times until today, which i why I'm writing this review. My family and I entered the restaurant and the employee was on the phone, no big deal, we'll wait. Note there was no other customer around to get served. After 4 minutes, she was still on the phone and a couple came in and she acknowledge them and told them she'll be right there with them. Then another customer came in. After waiting for about 7-8 minutes, she helps the couple and the other customer, even though we've been waiting longer. We just left and trust me, we'll NEVER be back. Horrible service!",

Our server, Ray, finally came to the table, slapped the water down and gruffly asked if we were ready to order. We asked for coffee first and he left. Waited longer and when the coffee arrived he almost left again and we told him we were ready to order. He took the order and left. Now keep in mind the restaurant wasn't busy, we had to ask a busboy for more coffee.  Our food came out and as always, very good.  We will go back, but will NOT sit in Rays' section.",

It's like as soon as the servers take your order they disappear, only to show up to deliver your food and give you the check. They rarely show up for refills, and when flagged down to do so, they act like they have something better to do.  During my last visit, 5/16/2017, I noticed my server would give the older diners impeccable service only to give the younger diners horrible service. She looked my way a handful of times but never came over to refill our drinks. She only offered to refill my wife's coffee when she quickly dropped off the check. Usually most servers ask everyone at the table if they're ready for a refill...nope not this one. It's as if she knew the older diners would tip her well so she treated them with the best service. Guess what, I tip well if you deserve it. If i receive good service, you'll get a decent tip. Don't assume the younger crowd won't tip well; give everyone the same quality service and you'll see the difference in amount of tips you make.  The food was still great, but with the quality of service I received, I'd rather order out instead.",

Instead of actually having a full wedding cake, made the same way rainbow cookies are made, I ordered 15 pounds of rainbow cookies and then they were stacked in towers on a dessert table for us. The bite size of the cookies is what makes it extra special. The Staff was super helpful, delivered it on time to the venue and even communicated with our planner to provide stands for the cookies that matched my decor. We also used chompies the next day for bagels, cream cheeses, coffee, etc. for our wedding brunch. delivery that morning was also smooth and everyone loved the food. communication was on point throughout my entire planning process and It was so nice to have those pieces of New York for our wedding weekend.",

I, personally, never lived in New York, but my sister and brother-in-law lived there for over 10 years and say that Chompie's hold True to the mentality and tradition.  Their matzo ball soup is delicious. I love their Brooklyner, and the Club. Their breakfast skillets are top-notch, and they have courteous servers.  This most recent trip I went in and had an odd request. My jaw is currently fractured and I can't chew. I asked if they could blend my matzo ball chicken noodle soup and bring it out to me. The waitress was so helpful and told me it wouldn't be a problem. When they brought it out it was all liquified, and it was WONDERFUL! It still had all the flavors of the soup, and the puree that I had in front of me was perfect for my jaw. I was so appreciative that they would take the time to do that for me while I can't chew right now. And to the waitress it was so nonchalant, I never felt like I was imposing that request on her. I am definitely a fan!  When you go, make sure to check out their bread items (bagels), and the HUGE assortment of sweets. They have a great collection of cookies, tarts, cakes, all for sale - and they're really good too!",

    "text": "As anyone who reads my reviews, whether you like them or not, you realize I have two passions, corned beef and pizza. I knew I wasn't going to go here for the pizza, but from their menu, I thought I had a good shot at getting a decent hot corned beef on rye with mustard. Wrong. I have ordered a lot of items from Chompie's, the majority of them very good, which is why I gave them 4 stars. They are unique, their menu items are novel and I enjoy the variety. Where they fail, oddly enough is in the basic deli items. Their corned beef was not as tender as it could be. It was not sliced thin, there was not enough fat. Mo H remarked how good the pickles were? Really? I felt they were too soft, and not tart enough, although I do prefer a half sour.  Where Chompie's hits the mark is with their unique menu items. You must try the \"Jewish sliders.\" This is basically a shabbas meal put on a challah bun. Brilliant. The brisket is amazing. So tender, like butter, the potato pancake is perfect, I don't know why they add cheese, but I would ask them to refrain. It is terrific. Their matzoh ball soup is one of the best I have had. The broth is superb. Not too chickeny, although the cup contains a bounty of carrots and celery, the soup is not overpowered in their flavor. The matzoh ball has the perfect density.  If you are in for breakfast, try the breakfast skins, but make sure you have about 8 people with you to eat these. Another novel take on something which has become so common, potato skins. Who would have thought about taking a bagel, topping it with scrambled eggs, potatoes, cheese, onions, sour cream. It works, and it is delicious.  These are the kinds of menu items Chompie's does right. Unfortunately, the corned beef sucks.  Don't leave without buying from the bakery. It is not the best bakery in the world. Canters in LA does better cookies, White Plains bake shop puts everyone else to shame with the cakes, but for Scottsdale, AZ, the black and white cookies are pretty good.",

If you haven't been in a while, be prepared for a huge menu change, and the choices that once existed are gone.  It seems like 50% of the menu is gone, and all my old favorites are certainly gone.    I can't really say whats going on, but our last two visits I can say started out fair, then slipped directly in to unacceptable.  I can say i never thought it was great, but I always thought Chompies did mediocre perfectly.     So I'll lay it out like this.    Burger, ordered medium, came out raw.  I'm not saying undercooked, I am saying the ground meat was RAW.  the cheese was melted, so I know someone put it on the grill to cook it.   Now talk about uncomfortable, we showed our server, who brought the manager (which we didn't ask for I assure you) who brought out a line cook...  What are you thinking, show him this health hazard somewhere else.  I did jokingly say I felt somewhat lucky we had Scottsdale Healthcare right next door after this one. In the same meal, we had two deli sandwiches.  All I can say was the meat was rubbery and wet.  Yes, wet.  To me it was almost like it came out of the freezer or something, sliced and put on the sandwich.  YUCK.    Now about the service which on my latest visit was ridiculously bad.  The waiter forgot items, didn't return to the table, and all, given the restaurant had 10 customers all together was horrendous.  (BTW, it wasn't our waiter who brought over the manager it was someone else, he was nowhere to be found)    Now my other recent visit, the service was stellar (at the PV Mall restaurant).  Our server was more than on, he was outstanding.  In fact, for that visit, the service was a solid 5/5... food was 1.5/5 on that one.  Anyway, for us, we have seen our last visits to Chompies.  I should throw in our out of town Guests, stopped going back last year except for one hold out, who has finally said its over as well....   Everything changes, and if you can't even do mediocre, then there isn't much left...",

It sounded good so I called the order (for 2) into Paul, he asked me to give it 10 minutes, I gave him 30. Went in, order not ready, in fact never placed, so I waited. First I paid, 2 sandwiches and a 2 sides of cole slaw, $33.00 Immediately I thought they placed an order for 4 sandwiches, nope 2. Since my buddy asked for them , I bit my tongue and proceeded to pay.  When I received the plate, 2 cole slaw (plastic cup the size of a silver dollar) and 2 sandwiches that were about 3 inches high. I first assumed when paying for these special meals the meat would be piled very high, but no. Oh yes, and I got 2 slivers of pickles, limpy and very tasteless. Corned beef, not good, rye bread was ok, lots of holes allowing mustard to squize out everywhere and the cole slaw, just ok. This isnt NYC or SF, $15.00 for a BS sandwich? I know the word Jewish deli comes with all the other reviews, sorry, from New York, this place is a poor example of a Jewish deli.",

The cheese blitzes are also perfect.  The service is inconsistent - that's frustrating but wouldn't stop me from many return visits.",

    "text": "In town for 2 days, went to breakfast here 2 days, because it's my dad's favorite place.  First day I ordered savory - got latkes with poached eggs. Both were done very well -the eggs were poached medium, exactly as I had asked.  2nd day I got the bobka french toast...which is basically the crumb topping on a coffee cake, but on top of your french toast instead.  Freakin' delicious, I tell ya.  The menu is huge, there were 5 of us ordering very different items, and everyone was very happy with the 10 selections over the 2 days we came.  Service was great both days.  Two negatives: the portions are ridiculous - I asked if I could order a half portion the next time I came and the server said no; and they don't have good coffee - no capuccino - but the server on the first day was very sweet and said we were welcome to bring something in from the Starbucks (okay-not good coffee but better than the coffeepot weak coffee) which we could see right out the window in the shopping center.  She also seemed frustrated that they couldn't offer that option. So I like her for that :-)",

I ordered a mile-high turkey sandwich on a gluten free roll and my boyfriend ordered a burger on a gluten free bun (he's not gluten free, but ordered it that way so I could try it too). The gluten free bun & roll are quite small compared to non-gluten free selections. Especially on the burger...his burger patty was at least twice the size as the bun! And we both found the gluten free bun & roll to be on the stale side. They were very crumbly, which is usually an indication that they're old. They make their own gluten free baked goods here which is pretty awesome, but it was unfortunate that we didn't get them fresh. But nonetheless, we were happy with our lunch.",

The bagels are definitely better quality then your average bagel place, and they have a nice variety of toppings for them. I ordered a veggie delight, and while I wish it had had more avocado, it had the right portions of everything else. My friend also had a great idea to get a few sides of breakfast potatoes to accompany the bagels. The home fries were awesome, sauteed with onions with the perfect amount of seasoning. Warning though, anything coming from the actual restaurant takes much longer than just getting a bagel, and the portions are huge!",

I won't say dirty, but it sure doesn't give the impression of spic and span one likes to associate with a food establishment.  I once asked a young woman at the checkout if this location was going to undergo a renovation to look similar to the Paradise store (i.e airy, bright, well-kept) and she looked shocked - informing this store had \"just\" been renovated....ten years ago. I really wanted to ask if that was the last time it had been mopped and vacuumed, too, but I just grabbed my hefty priced order and left.  I've not really been back, except maybe to grab a bagel when I've been too lazy to go to a nearby elsewhere location.  In their favor, there aren't that many Jewish delis in the vicinity, so if/when the mood strikes for a kosher hot dog or pastrami on rye, Chompie's got it, so have to hand it to 'em for that....",

The bagels are fab, the lox is fresh, and simply I know it would be exactly what I wanted.  In that respect, perfect to fill the void. Upon first entering, it's a little confusing. You first notice the take-out area, which is just all around a little sloppy and ill-organized. Then you notice the hostess, and she is quick to seat you. The dining room is larger than expected, it extends all the way through to a back room. The menu is extensive, and everything sounds delish.   I'm disappointed with the ambiance. Considering the high quality of the food and menu selections, I'd feel more comfortable if the place was more similar to like a Paradise Bakery instead of an IHOP... I also think a little breakfast bar would be perfect here. It was weird getting full waiter service for an easy little bagel sandwich.   They do have a full bar, so I naturally ordered a mimosa to celebrate a day off work ;). (Thank you MLK!) It was good. Not the best, not the worst.   I ordered a large mimosa, a bagel with lox and cream cheese, and a side of avocado. I considered my $18 tab a bit steep.   Will I return? Yes, but probably just for take-out. And only because I every once in awhile crave a good bagel with lox and cream cheese, and this place hits the spot. Unfortunately, the \"cons\" --namely the IHOP atmosphere and steep price tag -- are not enough for me to justify sitting down and exploring the menu more extensively.",

Walking in was like walking into chaos; stuff everywhere for the holiday and not really a line of customers but a \"crowd\".  Once figuring out where to place my order I walked up to the counter to wait for service listening to the staff talk about another job opportunity at a local hotel.    Once asked for what I wanted it took three people to get my order in the computer.  After waiting 5-10 minutes for my bagels I was handed a mess of items and had to ask for a bag.   (Two breakfast sandwiches and two bagels).  After getting home come to find out my order was wrong and ice cold, the bagels didn't seem like they had been baked 100% and I was very disappointed, I had asked for them to be toasted and even if they had cooled on my 5 minute car ride the butter wasn't even melted.  Really hard to believe that this is the best bagel in Phoenix for 30 years.",

    "text": "Chompies site will not allow us to post a 'paragraph' in a complaint to them - so here it is - BAD. We have been loyal customers for over 11 years. We frequented ALL 3 locations until Greenway closed. We LOVE Paradise Valley and have avoided Shea since there was an error on our dining room order. Yesterday at 4pm on 3/19/2016, we were giving Shea another chance. Yesterday, we craved Chompies and this was convenient. So - We wait patiently behind 2 customers. We wait & wait & wait - while the girl with bright red streaked hair s-l-o-w-l-y mashed new cream cheese into a bowl taken from the case. Then 2 doors to the case are removed and she looks up & comes to take our order, while YoYo reprimands her for leaving a mess at the bread slicer. We ask for extra lean corned beef & before we could get the \"thin sliced\" out of our mouths she is running to the back to tell the kitchen. My husband goes to be sure she heard us and she rudely says \"YES. I HEARD YOU.\"  She comes & goes from the kitchen 3 times trying to weigh out the pound and a half of  corned beef till it weighs correctly - leaving us for 10 minutes at the counter - never asking what else we needed.  She finally returns with the container of THICK sliced corned beef. We ask for 1/2 # chopped liver and... get cut off before we can tell her what else from the deli case... At this time we are irritated & just want to get the order - pay & leave. A loaf of Challa sliced, one brownie - Chopped liver & CB. We wait at the register - as YoYo helps her client and the African American boy helps his client. And we wait. And we wait ... as the red streaked girl goes back to emptying the case!! 4pm EMPTYING THE CASE as if we are not there.  Cream Cheese pounded down - bowls being filled - CLIENTS WAITING!!!  So before we get too angry we grab our order & go to the other register - that handles the Dining Room. We ask \"Mark\"?, the Manager in the red shirt - can we PLEASE check out here because the girl at the Deli is RUDE and not paying attention. His reply is to ask the GUY - who was helping someone else to ring us up. We said NO - Why piss off HIS customer too by leaving there to help US???   We again state the others were RUDE and we would like to pay here... He again asks about the other register - not caring about the complaint we just told him about!!   SERIOUSLY? We had a $60 order of food & he gives us this crap ?? WHERE IS YOUR CUSTOMER SERVICE? Lovey would be pissed. Lou would be furious. We storm out telling \"Mark\"? we will NEVER be back there.   Don't the employees give a damn? Don't they get TRAINING about Customer Service? NO ONE CARED that we walked out.  My Brother has been a customer for 25 years - He will never come again. Our associates will never come again. Our family will never return. Our Clients will never come again. Our neighbors...our blog readers, and YOUR YELP READERS will now hear about this.  Let your staff know that when they disrespect customers THEY TELL THEIR FRIENDS & FAMILY. There is a chain affect in the restaurant biz I learned about when I was a Manager in Chicago at a fine dining restaurant. Where FOOD is concerned people never forget & they are looking for QUALITY Customer Service (as well as quality food).  As you can tell - WE ARE MAD that our once favorite Deli is now off of our list. They need to do something about the Shea location. . You claim to have an \"authentic east coast tradition\". Well that is True because New Yorkers are known to be rude and that is how the staff is, perpetuating that stigma. RUDE.",

    "text": "With limited Jewish Deli options to choose from in the Valley, Chompie's  is at the top of my list when I'm craving matzah ball soup, potato latkes, bagels, black and white cookies, or quality sandwiches served with plenty of pickles!  I've ordered bagels in bulk from Chompie's before but until this past weekend, I'd never taken advantage of their catering options.  I'm typically a planner, but this year, the Jewish holidays came around way too quickly, and I found myself scrambling at the last minute to feed approximately 20 guests at a break-fast on Saturday evening.  I went to  the Chompie's website and found their catering menus for the holidays...  I called and ordered a sampler platter for ten (this came with egg salad, tuna salad, white fish salad, tomatoes, onions, cucumbers, cream cheese (veggie and regular), a small fruit plate, and a  chocolate babka...  All of this was conveniently ready for me to pick up Saturday at 1pm per my request.  I added to the order last minute , just to make sure I had enough food,  and the folks at Chompie's were fine with that.  They even helped me carry everything out to my car.    Turns out, we had way too much food; portions are huge!  But everyone left our house with full bellies and many with leftovers for the week.  I'm actually kind of bummed that I'm traveling this week as Jared will get to enjoy the leftovers without me...    Needless to say, I won't hesitate to use Chompie's for catering again in the future!",

It makes the best French toast...mmmmm. If you want your bagels sliced there is a small fee-we have a bagel slicer at home :). The butter cookies in the bakery are decent, but I've had better-haven't tried much of anything else in the bakery.   I love that it is family owned and right down the street from me!",

Our table was ready for us very quickly and we were able to order quite soon after we sat down.  We needed to ask for water refills though to give them credit, we did have a large group and it was not always clear exactly what we were needing.    As for food itself, there are some wonderful deals on the menu from combo meals to other daily specials.  I ordered the Soup, Sandwich, and Slaw deal.  I ordered the half sandwich as pastrami and the soup as chicken noodle soup.  Both appeared quite appetizing though they both ended up being only luke warm.  The food was still \"a-okay.\"  This has not been my typical experience at the Paradise Valley or Tempe Chompie's, which is why I still gave this rating 3 stars.  As this is my only experience in years at this particular location, I wanted to clarify my reasoning.   I still recommend Chompie's, especially for Jewish holidays such as Passover or Rosh Hashanah.  I also love the bakery and all that it has to offer.",

I asked them if we had to wait to be seated and without answering, they looked at each other with a smirk and nodded at the hostess to \"take care of us\".   Not the most welcoming feeling. When a customer asks you question, you answer their question. Simple as that. I've been in the restaurant industry for awhile and I would never \"blow off\" or make my customers feel unwelcome the minute they walk in.   Our server was alright, except for the fact we didn't get a single drink refill until she handed us our check...which implies that she didn't stop by to check on us at all.

The chicken was a pricey add on, but well worth it. They definitely didn't skimp out on the chicken. I really liked my salad.   My mom got a salad with salmon on top. She liked hers as well.   For desert we ordered a mini cannoli, and a mini chocolate mouse cake to split. The desert was sooo good. I really enjoyed both of them.   They have tons of deserts, like cookies and cake here.

I ordered my usual sampling of a full sandwich with mustard and cole slaw, this time to go.  Would you believe me when I tell you that the price displayed on the cash register was ... wait for it ... $14.15?  Seriously.  \"Uhm,\" said I, \"let's go with a half instead.\"  This approached $9.00.    But this was the tastiest of the four places I've thus far sampled.  Although I very much appreciated the \"clean\" taste of the nicely lean meat at Goldman's, Chompie's pastrami is warm and fatty and served on the best rye yet.  Yum.  And the bread actually tastes like rye, not white bread with caraway seeds. And it holds together nicely.  The crust is actually crusty with a cornmeal crunch.  Although lacking in flavor distinction, the pickle was nonetheless \"bright\" - obviously freshly made.  Well played, Chompie's.  After I finish my pastrami sandwich survey, I MIGHT be back.  But I just can't see awarding four stars for an almost $15 sandwich, nice as it is.",

I also have always gotten a bowl of the matzo ball soup with my sandwich. The entire reason I like this place is because of this soup. I wish I knew how to make it, it would save me a lot of money. I love the stuff. The sandwich is good too, but usually I'm just still on cloud nine from the soup I forget that I'm even eating a sandwich. I've had a few different desserts from the case. Very good but a little underwhelming, but that won't stop me from trying more. Last time, we got our food to go, which I kind of preferred. With the exception of the first time being there, we have gone at odd hours of the day and service was lackluster. Barbie is fantastic and we had her during lunch service the first time we went, but since then we have been seated and then NO ONE has come to our table. This is three of the four times we have had a meal in the dining room. In fact I think two of those three times I've had to wave the host down to tell her and another time I waved a server down and she hesitantly said she would be our server. It's just so bizarre. Even though our tab is usually around $35, I hate throwing away another $7 to a server for lousy service, but I also think it's lousy to under tip as I am a server myself. So that's my two cents on that. I think we have resolved to just get take out from now on. Save the extra $7. But I love the food and my mouth waters for matzo ball soup as I write this!",

    "text": "When I first sit down at Chompies there's just something comforting about that dish of pickles on the table.  Seriously, Chompies is the only place to get good Jewish deli food around here.  I've never had anything bad there, except sometimes the service (hence the four stars not five).  Excellent, excellent split pea soup, cheese blintzes, and breakfast combo meals of every possible variation.    I recently tried the Cabo skillet and loved it.  Their hash browns are perfect - slightly crisp on the outside, soft in the middle, and salted just right.   If you're looking for something a little different, get the Bagel Skins - an innovative idea that I keep meaning to re-create at home but I never do.   The deli sandwiches are great too -- just be aware that they are HUGE.  Luckily they also sell half sandwiches, and I usually order mine with half the turkey on two whole pieces of bread, because the human jaw simply was not built for sandwiches of Chompies' proportions.  Their turkey is delicious - SO much better than the slimy crap in the deli counter at the grocery store.    In summary, yes the service could be better, but the food makes up for it.",

    "text": "Very disappointed by Chompie's today, it seems they have gone downhill in their food preparation in the last year or so.  The restaurant is also outdated and needs some fixing up.  The cheese blintzes which used to be authentic are not water down to a real sweet treat rather than what they used to be.  Their bagels, well they are not longer the original bagels they used to make they must be skimping on the flour and not boiling them as real bagels are boiled.  the fruit cup they give with breakfast is small and only about a mouthful when it used to be much bigger and the hashbrowns mixed with onions is way way salty avoid at all costs.  Will not be going back disappointed in the quality of food.  The service was great, but the food was not even 2 stars. Oh yeah they do charge 1.50 if you want real maple syrup with your hotcakes otherwise they give you syrup with high fructose corn syrup in it.",

After waiting for a little time we were finally served water and asked for our drinks. Right away I asked if we can order one of their sliders so we can try it before our dinner. Waiter said no problem. Now their sliders are very good, It's like a whole meal in a bun! Don't know how anyone can eat their 12 sliders challenge! NO WAY!! Wife had their crispy chicken wrap, I had their all you can eat ribs. Wife's wrap was awesome! Very tasty, and her side dish of potato salad was just as good!! Their ribs were OK, not much meat, very fatty, even though I packed away 13 ribs!! Mom, it sounds worst than it is!! There just weren't that much meat! No wonder it's all you can eat! Now I am writing this review the next mourning and I can still feel the wrath of the ribs!! I will definitely go back. They have way too much items on their menu for us not to go back. But I will not longer order their ribs again.",

I had a half corned beef sandwich and matzo ball soup.  The tasty corned beef was lean and thinly sliced and piled high.  The rye bread was soggy on the bottom.  The lean corned beef is probably healthier than the marbled kind, but that is what you can get in LA and New York and it is sooo good.  The matzo ball soup had a few carrots and noodles, but the soup itself was nothing to write home to mom about.  The matzo ball was fluffy and comfortable.",

Sure they bring you out pickles and cucumbers which is awesome in my book, but most of the dishes are boring American choices or Jewish cuisine which I don't really crave. I do want to go back and check out the bakery though.  They had a huge selection of tasty treats in the window last time I was there with a mixture of everything you could want.   One thing that stands out in my mind about Chompies though is how dark it is in there. It gives it a very odd feel, and when you step back outside you are blinded by the Arizona sunshine.

A very hard thing to get over, regardless of Service or Taste.  Service:  Excellent, and I wonder if they're happy because they expect tips, above and beyond what you're paying for the food.  20% of a normal $5 is ok, but 20% of $75 is probably why they're smiling.  *** Please correct your prices so families can enjoy your family restaurant ***.  Taste:  Excellent.  I appreciate your taking lunchmeat and putting it onto my sandwich.  I just have trouble giving you 10 times the price of the lunchmeat.  I'd seen the Man vs. Food episode, so I was excited to eat their food.  I was just stunned to silence by the horribly high prices.  I just couldn't believe the cashier would ask for that much money with a smile on her face.  Now I know why they never mention prices on the show.",

The server will bring you out a plate of cucumbers and pickles right when you sit down and they're usually fast to take orders and bring out your food.  Be sure to check out the mural painted on the wall while you're there. There is a man holding a knife and if a diner is positioned just right underneath him, it looks as if he's about to be shanked.

I prefer mine to be thick cut with light and crisper coating.  I'm not sold on the place but it was clean and decent. I may give it a try one more time and see how they measure up than.",

Not to mention this was my THIRD time to go there after giving it more than one chance. Let's start with the food - maybe at one point when they were first founded it was done with care but now it seems like the cooks do not really want to come into work. The \"turkey Ruben\" was basically a hunk of old turkey soaked in grease and put on hard as a rock bread that was brought back to life with more grease before adding butter and toasting the minerals out of it, add a slice of American cheese and a hand full of cole slaw that was thrown in the air and whatever landed on the sandwich stayed, $11 for that is a disgrace. I returned it as I was just appalled by such disrespect for food, the manager came out what must have been 15 minutes later to \"talk\" to me - that turned into him arguing and yelling at me before leaving the area and slamming the door. Into service - every time I have been there it was usually empty to medium business and without fail it takes about 45 minutes to get the appetizer every time. Now you'd think it would be fresh and piping hot - nope, it was luke warm at best and had a microwave taste to it. If I was at some coney in south Phoenix I wouldn't care but in Scottsdale and for $40... Not gonna happen.",

I paid less this time and got a huge cobb salad with an abundance of toppings.

    "text": "Let me start by saying I've been going here off and on since 1998 or so, usually while on vacation (since 2000). The menu and the food have changed over the years, but the general quality is still there. This last visit I got the Brooklyner, which has corned beef, pastrami, and braised brisket. I finished most of it, but could have finished all of it if I tried. I know some people expect these huge mile-high sandwiches (like in NYC) but I've been to some of those delis and they charge $20 for a sandwich. So the sandwich may be bigger but you still pay for it. Anyway, $13.29 is a bit pricey for a sandwich, but this sandwich had a really excellent taste to it. Mike T. got a beef tongue sandwich, which was equally tasty. Both were admittedly a tad on the small side considering the price, but I think that's a minor point.  Chompie's is unique in that it doesn't just focus on the deli elements, they do traditional breakfasts, some Mexican food, burgers, crepes, wraps, there's something for everyone here. I think it generally fits the transient mindset of the Phoenix area, where most everyone isn't from there, they're either just passing through or ended up there by a set of circumstances. You could view this trait as a big minus and say that Chompie's doesn't match up to a traditional NYC deli (which it doesn't). But like a lot of other restaurants in the area, I think its strengths are that it continues to try new things with the menu and it tries to just create good food and atmosphere without being confined in a box.  Now on the menu they have 5 pounds of sliders for 50 bucks or so, it's free if you can finish in half an hour. That doesn't appeal to me, but it's just an example of a restaurant that isn't afraid to try something new while keeping their classic dishes in tact.",

Host was very friendly, father in law, who enjoys interaction with the customer. We ordered Penn Plaza and Meat Combo corned beef and pastrami special. Special on egg bread. Wow, meat was lean hot and tasty, side potato salad very good. Nice portion size! Server was terrific. Recommend highly.",

Overall, really decent deli and great rye bread.  :)  My complaint, and why I dropped the star, is that I have also never not been wrongly overcharged, or had them get a take-out order wrong.  This happened today, in fact, as I was in buying a lot of Mothers Day pastry.  And I was charged for items I didn't receive.  Same thing always happens with deli takeout too, though more often, they get the order wrong.  Of course, you don't realize this until you get things home, and you'd think I'd learn to double check before I leave, but the place is always a bit of a madhouse.    Good food, but if you do take out, check things before you pay.  They seem to have an issue with not getting the items and the bill to coincide.",

In fact, you go look in your refrigerator and you realize all the cheese has become a science project and you have no cream for your coffee. Crap.

By the time I get to the store, get back home, cook, eat, clean up, my morning is gone. That seems like too much effort on some days, doesn't it?  The answer?  Drive to Chompie's.   *By the time you put your baseball hat one, brush your teeth, get dressed and open the garage door: 10:15 a.m. *Go out to the driveway and pick up the weekend edition: 10:16 a.m. *Have a conversation with your neighbor about the irritating HOA rules and regulations and all the neighbors that don't pay attention to the HOA: 10:24 a.m. *Pull your car out of the garage and head to Chompies: 10:26 a.m. *Drive to 92nd Street and Shea, park and enter the restaurant: 10:40 a.m. *Wait for a table: 10:50 *Your order a beverage while you browse the menu: 10:55 *You realize its almost 11 a.m., which means that you can have breakfast or lunch and be within very good boundaries on either option.

She was ready to assist when we came in the door and advised on what we should order. We ordered a half dozen bagels and cream cheese. We also ordered carrot cake and chocolate box cake. All food was to go.  Our daughter is a huge fan of Despicable Me. They had a chocolate item with a Despicable Me minion on it so we HAD to order it. (They also had baked goods with characters that strongly resembled Big Bird, Elmo and Cookie Monster.)  Everything was delicious. The cakes were especially good.

I think they excel in the schmeer department.This reviews about the corn beef sandwich. The corn beef is a poor quality, and bland taste. The corn beef pales when compared to other delis in the greater Phoenix / Scottsdale area. Almost half the sandwich is fat and not chewable. Also, the bread they use for some reason is about the size of a finger sandwich or slightly bigger. It's too small for a normal sandwich. The coleslaw was also equally tasteless and mediocre. Lastly, the price is two to four dollars more then then other delis in the area for a similar size sandwich, but less than half the quality or test as the others. For a good bagel with a great schemer, Chompies. For a corned beef sandwich, look elsewhere.",

The ordering process is simple and quick and the price is low.  Yet, I am annoyed. I came in this late morning for a breakfast sammich. I ordered an everything bagel, toasted with a fried egg and sausage. I don't get down with the cheese. I get my sammich home and open it up and am immediately annoyed. Hence, why I'm annoyed.   I will attach a photo, but allow me to describe. The bagel is burnt on the inside edges, like Black. The egg is overcooked, not hot and runny like it should be. And the sausage is literally the size of a silver dollar. It BARELY covers half the bagel. I mean, come on. I ate most of it, but it was dry, with no salt or pepper or any seasoning beside the bagel itself. The sausage tasted like nothing. So annoying.   I will continue to buy bagels from Chompies, but I will never order anything else.   And some old lady cut me in line after hovering over my shoulder for five minutes. Back off lady! Grrr.",

However the fruit (pineapple, melon, and cantaloupe) was served in a small ramekin.",

It came out in a hot cast iron skillet, the top was crispy, brown and the inside ooey-gooey. I ate it right up and carried on with my business.   Another pro, our server! She was literally a doll and her name was Barbie. So kind and full of energy, made me feel like I was back in the South with that level of kindness and hospitality.   I also tried the onion rings, they're the perfect thin/thick ratio, but a little oily. Not my fave, but the service and mac n cheese covered all this visit.   Chompie's has an extensive breakfast menu that I wanted to try out, but it was too late for breakfast in my mind. Definitely check them out.",

Soup came with the top 1/3 of a sesame, plain and whole grain bagel.  They were cur horzontally and toasted nice and crisp...soup and toasted sliced bagels was delicious.  Chunks of hand cut celary and carrots aprox .20 inch and plenty of noodles.  Large Pastrami on rye was moist with 10 oz of meat.  I'm not sure, but  the 3 pickle spears tasted homemade with still a strong/fresh taste of cucumber and not just vinegar and dill.  Potato Salad side was pretty small, it had about 9 small cubed potatos and some pimentos...to me it was just okay.  Ill go again, but I'll probably skip the potato salad.",

Then I had to ask for a bag in which to put the two containers.  The bakery items look wonderful but the prices are outrageous--$16.00 per lb for cookies. I have been many times and the one in PV mall is much friendier and welcoming.  This one has a bit of much of the Sdale attitude for its own good!",

In Beverly Hills the best corned beef (Nate and Al's)can be accompanied by the worst latkes(Nate and Al's). In New York you'll get steered specifically to the brisket at Katz. For our money the best pastrami is Chompies in Scottsdale. They won't cater to hoopleheads who request lean pastrami like it's corned beef. Chompies slow cooks the smoked and rubbed brisket so that the seasoning melts into the fat cap and permeates the flat meat. It forms an unctuous glaze that raises a simple sandwich on double baked rye, to the level of vision  quest. The potato salad is spot on to our taste. Great personalized service. (Kudos to Barbie) Maybe take some takeout with you, your waitress will be happy to get it for you from the deli",

SO THIS REVIEW IS AS AUTHENTIC AS IT GETS!  First of all there is no comparison to others calling themselves Jewish Delis. Trust me i went to the top 5 delis in Scottsdale, and it's not even fair to compare them. Chompies bakery section is bigger than the other delis full size. This is the best Jewish Deli on the West Coast, by far. Gordan the manager was kind enough to let me taste the hot and cold corned beef before i ordered my lb. to go. The fresh homemade bagels were pretty close to my beloved Philly \"water bagels\". Chopped liver was just ok to me, but rating a delis chopped liver isn't really fair, as different people like different versions. THAT IS NOT TRUE OF CORNED BEEF AND PASTRAMI!!!!  Corned Beef is Corned Beef. Pastrami is Pastrami. You can compare!!!! Chompies wins my vote(outside of East Coast Deli)and i am a deli expert. That said.. as good as it is... it's a notch down from authentic Jewish east coast deli's. That's okay though as i now have my Sunday mornings figured out at Chompies before the NFL kicks off. This deli is the real deal!!! And the inside feels authentic East Coast. Big cases to see all the foods and Meats to choose from. Felt like i was home again! Enjoy! Trust me!",

I have choices!  I am not going to your deli as a favor to you. I am hungry, I want some good food and it is convenient for me. I expect friendly service and a clean establishment. Let me restate ... It is the experience that I am seeking ... A good experience where I feel welcomed and wanted ...   Then I read on the sign \" a New York deli\" yep... I felt like I was in the New York so many generalize about ... Unfriendly, aloof, brusque, almost rude!   I ordered the Wall Street bagel with lox and cram cheese. The bagel was good, short on lox, no capers offered. For 9$ I would have expected it to be exceptional. I ordered coffee, all the pots were empty. I went to a table to eat but after a few bites a lady stepped to the table and huffed ... \"These tables are for customers wanting waitress service, not take out.\" There were approximately 20 tables with 3 taken by customers. The rest were empty. In the take out area there are 3 tables and they where full. Outside in the 50 degree wind, all the tables were empty. So outside we went sitting on frigid iron chairs while there were warm empty tables just inside.  We were in fact customers, we bought the food in your establishment, just on the wrong side of the partition.   Your food may be good enough but you have failed to offer me the experience I have come to expect from delis like Einstein Brothers.   You failed to make me feel like a valued customer. I was just a buck for you! Now I know and will spend my dollars elsewhere.",

I was there the other night at 8:30. I know the place closes at 9 o'clock and people want to go home. I understand that I literally ordered three things within a matter of five minutes they're all cold food I even wanted some pastries but I saw they were all wrapped up for the evening and I don't want to keep anybody later.

A quick, non-scientific taste test confirms the apt naming.  My mom and I split a Reuben sandwich, and it was good.

Whether you're in the mood for breakfast (served ALL DAY), lunch (sandwiches) or dinner (entrees), Chompie's has the best breakfasts, best sandwiches (the corned beef sandwich will give you enough meat to make another 2-3 sandwiches), and best home cooked entrees I've ever eaten at a deli.  Plus, their matzo ball soup is TO DIE FOR!!!  Big, soft balls just like my grandma used to make!",

    "text": "We don't live here so are in only occasionally. A friend told us of new ownership but assured me it hadn't changed a thing.  It feels different to me. We bought cookies for a party yesterday. Although three people were behind the baked goods counter, apparently only one was authorized to wait on customers with a second charged with telling us (the only customers waiting) that we would be helped soon. The third might have only had responsibilities at the other end of the counter but was watching the person helping customers ring up an order. $1.95 per cookie for a 4 inch star shaped sugar cookie frosted and with sprinkles seems high but people at the party liked them. Today we went for breakfast. There was a brief wait to be seated by a pleasant, professional hostess. We waited almost as long to meet our waitress though an uncommunicative busboy provided silverware and napkins but not water in the meantime. There was a very long wait for the food to come out of the kitchen. I should have timed it... At least 20 minutes, maybe longer. It was about 11a.m. on a Sunday.  The orders were correct though my omelette was not well put together. Our waitress checked back immediately but didn't refill our water until she had presented our check.  $27 seemed high for a breakfast for two but my wife did add a bagel to her breakfast not realizing it wasn't included.",

Everyone a little different from the next but I love this location because of its shear size. I first tried Chompies 8 years ago before I even moved to Arizona and it was good for a small family lunch out on the way up to Fountain Hills. Their bagels and cream cheese are very good. Not the best in the area, but close enough. The Chicago dog, which is what I had today was pretty good. Again not the best in the area but a decent price with fries. I love their fries. Always very warm, never hot or cold. Nice and thick with the skin still on them! There is plenty of space but unfortunately you don't always get lucky enough to get a good server. The delicatessens are good. Haven't had much Jewish desserts but their cookies that they give free with a kids meal are soft and yummy. There is a very large variety, so be prepared to be a bit overwhelmed!!",

What truly impressed me was the beef.  It was not to salty and no pieces that you had to hod your napkin up and spit out.  Those are the reasons I never have this kind of sandwich.  Just great beef with the right kind of condiments in my opinion.  When we got the bill I was holding my breath.  What would it cost when the beef was in my opinion excellent.  My surprise at how reasonable the cost was.  Now I have to make a point of getting back there.  I like good potato pancakes.  If they are as good as what I had today, I'll be one happy camper!",

    "text": "Being a former \"New Yawka\" I treasure my NY deli food.  With that being said, Chompie's used to be the only game in town.  This review is specific to the Scottsdale location. I would go back to the PV Mall location, but I'm all finished with the Scottsdale/Shea location.  The 4 of us went to eat, it was NOT busy. Our waiter, who had NO personality attempted to take our order. I asked for a corned beef on Kaiser roll. He told me they were 50 cents extra. I asked if he could please show me on the menu, where it said that, since it was not obvious to me and I couldn't see it.  I honestly didn't care about the 50 cents.  He said he doesn't know where on the menu it said that, but he knew it was there.  Ok, fine, I ordered my kaiser roll, prepared  to pay the additional cost, since that's how I like my sandwich.  I got up to take a walk over to the bakery, while our food was being prepared.  The manager, who was on duty that night, came up to my husband at our table and basically shoved the menu in HIS face to show him where it said there was an additional charge for kaiser rolls.  So when I got back from the table, he pointed it out to me. I then, took it upon myself to go up to the manager AND the server and I told them I was sorry, I wasn't trying to be petty, but my husband showed me where it said the additional charge on the menu. I apologized and told them I just couldn't find it, since it wasn't THAT obvious.  Well the freakin manager LAUGHED at me after I apologized!  Are you KIDDING me? How many restaurants actually have a customer who says they are sorry and then you are going to laugh at me? Apparently they have no idea that YELP is my newest obsession! I will NEVER go back to this location...EVER!  There are WAY better NY deli's in town now. Watch out Chompie's.....you have some new competition....thankfully!",

    "text": "Tonight was our second time at this Chompie's and had I written this review after our first visit, I would have given it 4 stars.  However, after the service we received tonight, we will not back.  After reading other reviews, one can only assume that the Borenstein's have made so much money that they could care less about what kind of service their patrons get.    We arrived around 5:00pm and the restaurant was not very crowded yet.  My husband order a soup and sandwich and I ordered the Jewish sliders.  Long story short .... every table around us received their food even though they arrived after us!  It took so long that the couple next to us commented on how long our food was taking (at this point they were almost done with their meal).  Not being able to locate our server, I went up to the hostess and asked if someone could find out where our food was.  In less than a minute the manager (Phil) magically plots the food on the table and says, \"the sliders just take a really long time\".  No apology, nothing.  Without  going into the a lengthy description of the dialogue that followed between my husband and Phil, suffice it to say that Phil had real attitude for manager.  At no time did he offer an apology, free dessert or to take anything off the bill.  He practically blamed us for being too impatient!  To make matters worse, right after Phil left the table, our server, Justin, decide to continue with the attitude.  He asked us how everything was and my husband replied that, \"he didn't know yet because we just got our food.\"  Justin didn't seem to understand why my husband was so upset, and my husband explain about the wait for the food.  Justin's reply ..... \"Well, you have your food now ... what's the problem?\"  I left out lot's of detail, but you get the picture.... they could give a crap about service.  I don't care how good the food is, but rude service with attitude, especially from management is never acceptable.  We will not be back!",

If breakfast is not your thing then go for the deli sandwiches and bring a friend to help you lift and eat the huge stacks of meat. I like the Motown and get it slightly grilled. The matzo ball soup is the best remedy for a cold. No kidding...order it (with the chicken), have a cup of tea, go home take a nap. You will be healed.  Visit the bakery counter before you leave.",

I said \"that makes no sense, what if they don't come , I have to stand here all day?\" At this point , and again im being completely accurate , the man started screaming , yes screaming at us to \"get the hell out , get out and don't come back , we don't need your business\"  As this was happening the rest of my party actually did show up and witnessed the entire thing , as did a lobby full of customers. The man at the hostess desk is an arrogant, nasty human being. I will never set foot in chompies again nor will anybody that I tell this story too and I know a LOT of people in the valley , a whole lot. I also welcome any manager or owner to contact me about this individual or our experience.",

The young man forgot the order, sent chicken noodle soup to the table when it was to be matzo ball soup.  Returned with a cold matzo ball to put in the soup.  Forgot the other soups and then brought them cold.  Forgot the drink and after dinner he brought it, but stopped at the wrong table to deliver it.  Took back one of the cold soups to warm it up and then did not bring it back till others were finished with dinner and also delivered the Reuben sandwich at the same time.  Did not bring the ketchup and we had to get up and get it from another table.  Also needed napkins, but did not see anyone to ask, so got our own.  The food was bad.  I always order a chopped liver sandwich and this time the liver was in large pieces, so you had to chew it.  The Reuben had very little sauerkraut; you could not even find it on the sandwich.  The check was wrong, and we had to get up to pay at front desk, except for all of the above everything was fine.",

I will admit they do have some decent food and, depending on who you get as a server, the service can be decent too.  However, my last experience was just over the top.  My companion and I started off by ordering two coffees.  After waiting for about 15 minutes, the waiter finally came back with two cups of coffee, one of which was only half full.  We both stared with puzzlement at the coffee and when he came back a short while later, I pointed out the curiosity before us.  He looked down at the two cups, laughed, and then proceeded to pick up the full cup and pour part of its contents into the one that was only half full.  In the process, he spilled part of the coffee all over the table and then left us staring in bewilderment at the two, now semi full cups, and the puddle of coffee before us.  After another tedious waiting period, he finally came back for our order and when we pointed out the puddle of coffee on the table, he again snickered and sloppily sopped it up with a rag.  The remainder of the breakfast was similarly sloppy in service.",

    "text": "I went in to Chompie's this morning on the way to the hospital. The weekends are the only time they make whole wheat flagels. As a person who eats almost no bread, I let myself have this treat when , my dad is in the hospital which is usually twice a year. Long story short, no flagels but I was told it would be 20 minutes. I was offered a drink and cookies which I politely declined. I was ok just waiting..........the owner gave me 2 cannoli's on the house just for waiting. 35 minutes  later no flagels! It was all good I was in no rush. However, the owner handed me the flagels and my veggie cream cheese on the house. I was totally willing to pay, I knew I would be waiting. That's great customer service, as a server and a manager in a restaurant, I know how important that is. Thanks guys!!!!!!",

    "text": "While at the Tempe Chompie's, I had a very plain tasting  \"Matzo Brei,\" that even syrup and salt couldn't flavor up. The Black and White cookie was pretty bad too. It had a lemon flavor, and the black or white side tasted good at all. A young staff, probably because it's right near ASU.  I couldn't believe Chompie's was this bad, so I went a second time in Scottsdale and had their \"Original Jewish Sliders.\" The Sliders were pretty good, and the gravy was excellent. More than anything, I liked the inventiveness of the ingredients. This experience changed my view. An older staff, probably because it's in Scottsdale. :)  I should have lowered my expectations based on the overall Yelp score, but a friend said it was the best deli in the Phoenix area. It probably is, but that doesn't say much. It's not even in the same stratosphere as other major cities.",

The OJ we were told wasn't made here but that they get it from the orchard... tasted like tang but maybe worse. The powdered hot chocolate was bearable but the only reason we got that stuff was so I didn't feel bad sending the OJ back and asking the waiter to remove items from the check.

    "text": "I can't say enough about Chompie's so I'll make this a short review.  First thing: seating. Very comfortable sturdy chairs to hold large and wide bodies like mine. Half booths are good except tables are very close together so sit on the outside so your body doesn't scrape the other table. Big folks, y'all know what I mean right? Butt scrapes the table behind you, stomach pushes on the table in front.   I try different plates each time I visit, this time was no exception. Today I had the Sharshava (spelling?) which comes in a skillet with different peppers, a tomatoey sauce and bits of feta cheese spread all over. Two eggs your choice, two huge slices of toast and you're done.   This dish was soooo good! It reminds me of a Middle Eastern dish and although it has peppers, it's not spicy. The sourness of the feta really makes this dish pop with flavor and using the bread to sop up that broth/juice is simply delightful.   My sister had the Chompie's Benedict something or other. It looked good but I wouldn't know. I'm one of those who can't eat runny egg yolks. Ewwww! When I see runny yolks I'm gonna start running.  Afterward, I went to the bakery counter for cookies and bagels. Have you ever visited a bakery and just wanted one or two of everything? Yeah, that's always me when I get to Chompie's. Alas, my pocketbook and my A1C prevent me from going crazy so I limited myself. And because I checked in via the YELP app, I received a free black and white cookie! Thank you YELP and Chompie's for valuing my visit!!",

To start, the decor of this place brings you right to New York. A busy and eclectic bakery counter greets you to the right, and a mural of Broadway shows brings you to the left, where the dining room is located. I remembered everything from childhood, so it was really fun to see it as an adult.   The decor isn't the only thing here that's New York though, the service follows suit. Prepare for somewhat abrupt, but friendly and joking service. I would hope the attitude wouldn't be misunderstood as rudeness, but it's definitely a bit different than what you might find elsewhere.   I ordered the Cabo skillet, which was AMAZING. One of the best breakfasts I've had. I love that every breakfast comes with a side of bread, and you would be a fool not to choose their famous bagels. I made sure to grab a black and white cookie on my way out as well, another thing it would be silly to leave without!  Don't come here expecting a high end brunch experience with mimosas and kale garnishment. Come here expecting an extremely large New York Deli/bagel shop/bakery. You will get one of the best breakfasts of your life, and will want to make it a regular pit stop whenever you're in town!",

I really enjoy all of their breads and often have them in my pantry. This place is such a savory treat. Definitely a place that you want to take people when they come from out of town.  A really awesome little New York style deli here in the heart of Arizona. The family has been in Arizona for many years and has a staple for their food an ambiance in there Jewish deli. it would be really difficult to find something terrible on their menu. all of their sandwiches are unique and different and it's especially delicious. You can't go wrong with a good Reuben. I really enjoy their breakfast as well. Portions are huge. Price points are on track with the amount of food that you're given. all of the workers are always very passionate, kind, and considerate. You can tell that management is strong and they take care of their employees. I highly recommend this Deli in Phoenix. They also have locations in Paradise Valley, Scottsdale, and in most of your grocery stores you'll find their bagels and bread.",

I had a cup of Matso Ball soup and half a Hot Pastrami sandwich.  Then meat in both sandwiches were tender and flavorful on rye bread which was fresh. The Matso Ball soup was in a cup all the noodles, chicken, vegetables were packed in this cup surrounding the Matso Ball. It was hot and had nice flavors. One of my favorites.",

I love their bagels, their soups, the sandwiches are almost too much to eat at once, the salads are great and if you stop in for breakfast, the omelettes are... well let's say I have literally written home about them. Prices are more than fair for what you get and they are fast!   This is one of those places that works for a casual client meeting spot, a meal with the family (it's actually loud enough that the wife and I don't have to panic when our 2 year old has a freak out) or a quick bite on your own. I don't know why, but this is one of those places where you see lots of people eating by themselves and it doesn't look sad. The take out counter is quick and I seriously can't say enough about how much I like the food.... seriously!",

I love the bagels - just the right east coast texture - and the strawberry-almond cream cheese is wonderful.  We've sat in the restaurant twice and the service is always quick and friendly. They are famous for their sliders for a reason. Mini challah rolls with lean brisket, mini potato pancakes, jack cheese, gravy, topped with fried onions - this is great comfort food.

It's frustrating that there is such a limited supply of Deli's in this area-- and there is nothing that even approaches a great Chicago style Deli. This is the second time I've eaten at Chompies, and both times have been a huge disappointment.  The other night we went for dinner. We felt like we sat forever before someone waited on us. Then she disappeared- more interested in taking pictures of a group of slider eaters in back. Another waiter showed up later...looked at me and asked me if I was the \"mashed potatoes\". I said yes, and he told me they were OUT of mashed potatoes. Since I was having hot turkey-- this was quite disappointing. After much more waiting, I ended up asking when our meals would arrive ( we had been there an hour already) My plate of turkey with dressing and their interpretation of french fries arrived...with congealed cold gravy on the side. Everything was SOOOOoooo salty, it was borderline inedible. My husband got what they consider a ham and cheese omelet. Scrambled looking eggs with slices of cheese on top. Mediocre at best.

    "text": "OK first I must admit that I do eat here at least once a month and have for a couple years but thats because there are no alternatives in the East Scottsdale Shea area.  Please someone build a breakfast place here that is smart enough to have free internet.  I can't believe I pay high prices for breakfast at a joint that is to cheap to deliver free internet to their clients.  I always have to sponge off Kinkos and thats painfully slow.  Its 2012 if you sell coffee and breakfast you better offer internet.  The display cases look great but most of the deserts that I have had taste a little stale.  The most impressive thing about this place is the photos of the owner rubbing elbows with all the Hollywood Elite.  Maybe thats why breakfast costs more than $10.00 somebody has to pay for all those expensive friends.  The employees are very nice the coffee selection limited and average tasting.  Bagel sandwiches are good.  I have been informed by employees who work there that they have failed many health inspections so I try to stick to coffee and bagel and avoid the eggs and meat.  All in all very average yet convenient.",

Once we all settled down and started to look over the menu the waiters/servers came by to take our drink orders. They came back fast with our drinks. Our orders were then taken. Soups came out in a timely manner and so did our entrees.  The soups were reminiscent of our moms home cooking. Chicken Soup with Matzo Ball. Heavenly.  Our entrees which were sandwiches pretty good.  Okay, I got the brisket on Challah. It came with a gravy but I would of preferred Au jus. The brisket was a little on the dry side. I should of gotten pastrami. My son said it was great!. My husband enjoyed his corned beef sandwich on rye.  So for the food I would give maybe 3 to 3 1/2 stars. But because the service was outstanding, especially with such a large group, I'm bumping up to 5 stars. The service was fantastic!!!  Come on Chompies, open a restaurant out by me, Please.",

Anyway, the food that did come out was hot, tasty, and abundant.  The service was very good too.  Bravo, Chandler Chompies.

This weekend they seated our party of 13 Sunday morning as soon as we got there.    Bustling, animated and fun- Chompie's not only offers high quality breakfasts and lunches but a dynamic, fast-pace for dining.  You may need to wait a little bit for your food since they get so busy- but that's part of the experience.  Just keep busy with the various football games displayed on their tvs throughout the restaurant. It's nice too that you can walk through the restaurant and the staff gets to know who you are- that sure doesn't happen at big chains.   Personally I enjoy their coffee over ice with hazelnut creamer, Chompie's egg breakfast with loose scrambled eggs with american cheese on top, and their everything bagel with olive pimento cream cheese.  Their potato pancakes are incredible with sour cream and apple sauce.  Yum.   Gretchen is by far their best server with her 100% accuracy for orders and her charming attitude.  When I'm traveling or on vacation I miss home since I miss out on my weekend ritual of Chompie's!",

My brother opted for a cup of split pea soup (it was so good and I don't even like split pea soup ..he gave me a taste) and 1/2 real turkey (not fabricated) sandwich. We shared an apple strudel for dessert and it was so so. They were handing out chocolate babka samples as we walked out and of course we tasted them. Best babka ever. There was no need to eat anything else for the rest of the day.....(ok, I had a few peanuts at the ball park later that evening.)",

The matzo ball soup is a must try, unless you're not a fan of a dumpling style soup. We recommend the sweet potato fries and the potato salad. The coleslaw is good but we tend to like it a bit more vinegary than it was. My friend thinks it's a bit pricey, but I willingly pay a few extra bucks for food prepared fresh and not from a bag.

Greeted by the worst greeting EVER after being ignored for 2-3 minutes standing right IN FRONT OF GREETER. Once seated our server came, rushed by and we weren't quite ready.  She rushed off muttering an \"I'll be back in a few\", 8-10 minutes later, she rushed back, (thank goodness we knew what we wanted, the boot camp fitness omelet for both of us), off she went.  A good time later, another server approached with our order, realized it was the same so she didn't have to engage us and literally, I mean, literally TOSSED our plates on the table and turned so fast to get away from us we were both shocked.  Now, mind you, we're easy going, my husband is a police officer, we're not alarmists.  So far, this was a disaster dining experience. It got worse as I finished my tea and our meals and after finishing our food NEVER could wave down our server or ANYONE again.  We went up to the \"greeter\" and said we have to leave and he said you have to pay your server.  I told him we COULDN'T EVER GET HER ATTENTION to do so and he said with a huff, \"fine, where were you, is this what you had....\", Dammit I even left her a tip and I still want it back.  I really wish I didn't have to type this.  In fact I rarely do reviews.  It was just so sad that they feel that they can treat people this way. In closing, shame on you Chompie's Deli.  I'm telling everyone I know your service is the worst.",

When it comes to everything else, it's just okay. For breakfast I've had runny eggs, undercooked potatoes and soggy bacon more than once. For lunch I've waited upwards of 30 mins for a check. But the portions are huge and prices are very reasonable. And kids eat free Mondays and Tuesdays. Not to mention you can split a kids meal between two or three kids. So why do I keep going back you might ask? I work really close to there and I am in love with their bagels. Two eggs, bacon, sausage or ham, home fries and a bagel is only $5.99. Can't beat that.",

The menu  selections are great, the dining room is well decorated, and the front bakery counter is incredible; however the wait staff members are horrible. They are so uninterested in their work. Our waiter took forever to take our order. He mumbled so I had to ask him to repeat himself every time he said something. He seemed bored and sleepy. Then he and the other wait staff disappeared. The restaurant only had three other tables at the time, and there were three waiters/waitresses working. They must have gone to hang out in the back because we saw no one until our order came. The order took longer than expected, and was cold when it arrived. Who wants to eat cold eggs and cold pancakes - the butter wouldn't even melt on the pancakes. And the waiter disappeared again and didn't come back until he brought our bill.  The food could be really good if it was hot. This happened to us the first time we were here also. Expensive too. We each had the same breakfast - two eggs, two strips of bacon and two pancakes. No drinks other than water and the total was over $21. Too expensive for poor service and cold food. Sorry, won't be back.",

The lox was decent (for AZ), eggs Benedict were great, Greek omelette came cold but was still tasty and waffles were tasty too.  2 gripes...when I order coffee, why on earth would you fill it to the brim multiple times (even after I asked for a separate cup to dump some out to make room for milk)?  Most take milk or cream to lighten it up.  Also, I have a HUGE problem when I don't see Heinz ketchup on the table in favor of a less expensive brand.  If they are skimping on ketchup, are they skimping on the quality products used elsewhere in the restaraunt?  Overall positive experience and would return again.",

Being from NYC it does not bother me, more comforting actually. They've been around for a very long time in AZ and I've been friends with the family for many, many years. They're absolutely great souls! If you're reading this and have read my other reviews you'd know that I typically don't like to write about the staff, I enjoy writing about the food, and think any staff member can have a bad day, ..... Sooooo not a reason to complain. I do like to compliment when something goes well though. The place was packed, the staff was busy and the wait was long,I'm good with all of that, and in the midst of all this \"organized chaos\" was the most polite and sweetest hostess. My Wife was pointing out how big her smile was. Just kind of made our wait that much better. On the way out we asked for her name, I believe it was Fay...? Hopefully that's correct! Anyway, the family would be pleased with her BIG TIME! As for the food.....well, delicious as always. The Pancakes were awesome the LEO too!",

On a walk with my one yr old and I ran inside to get her a bagel to snack on. Stood in line under the 'order here' sign for 15 minutes the girl at the register then managed to disappear after she helped the ONE customer in front of me. After being skipped by at least 4-5 customers going to the 'pay here' sign that woman decided to finally help me. Very very lazily got my bagel for me while pausing to have a great conversation with her coworker across the restaurant. All the while I think he was the manager was oblivious to the whole situation or just didn't care. Restaurant was dirty everything is way too over priced for the service you get by these rude girls. After waiting in line for 20 minutes I needed a beverage yet no one there willing to assist me - should have walked out. My advise - go to one of the other many options in a 1/2 mile radius where they don't treat customers like crap.",

The service: 1-star seems generous. It seems like the service is ok at best most of the time, but occasionally terrible! Last night our service was slow, our waiter was difficult and when we left he started to accuse us of not paying (we left the full amount of the bill on the table with a overly-generous tip after we had not seen him for 10 MINUTES).

Before we moved away, whenever we were in the mood for NY style deli food, this was our go-to place.  When the parents were in town, this happened almost weekly.  It was the one place we could all agree upon.  And if the service was bad, the food more than made up for it. Plus, the bad service gave us all something to complain about, while eating obscene amounts of delicious deli food.  So, really, this was a win-win. ;)    Some of my favorites include the Matzah ball soup (if you're ever sick, this stuff is truly medicinal), cheese and berry blintzes (like cheating and getting dessert for dinner, yay!), stuffed cabbage rolls (love the sweet and tangy sauce), and the potato latkes... not to mention the incredible, ginormous sandwiches.  Chompie's meats and their breads are excellent.  They have their own bakery, where they bake their famous bagels and more, way more... cakes, cup cakes, black and whites, cannolis, rainbow cookies, rugelach, etc, etc.  Their extensive bakery is seriously one of the best in the valley and we rarely ever came to Chompie's without getting dessert (and some sweet goodies to take home.)",

The service was alright, they took my order, brought me my sandwich, were polite, what else do I need? Oh and the half-sandwich deals make a lot of sense as the sandwiches are monsters that can probably feed a whole family. Even the half sandwich made me feel pretty damn full, and I am not a wimpy eater.  Update 4/30/12: I went here again today and I decided to lower my review from 5 stars to 4. Got the Ruben again and though it was really good, I realize it is just not quite up to the revered 5 star level. Can I re-emphasize how enormous these things are? I ate like half of half of the sandwich, which was just loaded with corned beef, and felt so full I had to wimp out on the rest.",

If you're going to walk by me 117 times before seating me, you could at least acknowledge I'm waiting.    The server had no serving skills whatsoever.  Do you seriously need to reach over me to take the condiments off the table and give them to someone else?  Petty, I know.  She was at least friendly and adequately attentive.  Thankfully, the cook had some degree of cooking skills.  I had the Western sliders (challah rolls filled with BBQ brisket) and while nothing spectacular, it was solidly A-OK.  I think I prefer the Jewish sliders (brisket minus the BBQ, add a potato pancake).  My favorite part of Chompie's is the window shopping after dinner in the bakery.  Sadly we were unable to be helped in the small window of time I had before the plus one decided it was taking too long.  A decision he later regretted I'm sure.",

The blueberry cream cheese is particularly good, however they also have a salted caramel cream cheese that I am excited to try next time I nearby. The one thing I wish they would improve is their coffee. It is solid diner coffee, but nothing to write home about.",

Even the salads are all made with 90% iceberg lettuce even when advertised as \"crisp greens\". It's so easy to make a really good salad, I'm not sure why theirs suck so bad. On my most recent visit I got a bowl of split pea soup and it was probably the worst split pea soup I've ever had. Too salty and otherwise boring.   The baked goods are pretty good, but it really depends on what you get. The bagels are not all that great, but the honey bran muffins are bomb.   **Note: avoid visiting the University location which is riddled with loud, sometimes trashy college kids.",

The home fires are too greasy, the toast is only toasted on one side, and the over medium eggs  were cooked the same as you would cook them for a fried egg sandwich.

Spoke with a gentleman to place the order which consisted of TWO number #1's, scrambled, American Cheese, Bacon on Toasted Gluten Free Bagels.  I swung by and picked up the order, paid $13.08 and then left to go home.  My second mistake, was not checking the order right then and there.   When I got home, I went and sat down at the kitchen table.  I opened up my first bagel sandwich and sure enough it didn't have any bacon on it.  I also noticed that the Bagel wasn't toasted as I had asked for.  The second bagel sandwich was the same way.   Did I pay extra for Bacon?  Of course I did.  Why does this keep happening?  What goes wrong with your process that doesn't allow the credit order to get back to the kitchen to make the sandwiches?  Very frustrating!

I really can't say I notice a great difference in their food, service or cleanliness.  During the past decade I have tried most things on their menu, with mostly positive thoughts.  Our last Chiompie lunch was here in Scottsdale and as we have a \"soft spot\" for their original slider, I ordered 4 for my wife and I. We love that cup of rich gravy that comes with it to dunk!  I grew up in NYC and have always been a deli fan who has known the best, and they compete in most areas. We would frequently order a corned beef or pastrami sandwich and a bagel, then remove some of that mountain of cold cuts and construct a very meaty additional sandwich at no further charge! I like to nibble on the half sour kosher pickles they place on every table at no charge.  Certainly worthy of 4 stars.",

My Dad was so looking forward to returning to Chompies after his last visit two years ago. He spoke of how he loved the tongue sandwich.  We brought everyone back to Chompies. After all the anticipation, we were all very disappointed. They start out with a pickle tray. The pickles were limp and obviously  not fresh. My Dad's tongue sandwich was awful. The meat was chopped into pieces and tasted odd.  It was previously thinly sliced and flavorful. My husband, son and I ordered the soup and half sandwich. We all opted for the pea soup and pastrami sandwich. Both have been delicious on our prior visits. Unfortunately for us all we found the soup to be both too thick and overly salted. The pastrami was so fatty and not enjoyable at all. The Rye bread was good as per everyone who ordered it. I am not a fan of Rye bread so I opted for the Kaiser roll. I found it to be too doughy and almost stale. The service was ok but nothing special. The highlight of the meal were the patries. We chose to take home canolies and a few napoleons. Typically the pastries are wonderful and again didn't disappoint. All in all our experience was disappointing. I would love to say that their Bagels are great; however, I find that the Bagels at our local Safeway are much better.  Sorry to say we won't be back anytime soon.",

If I'd not done take out, I would've sent it back.  It came on limply toasted pumpernickel without either mustard or mayo. The pastrami (if it was, it tasted unlike any pastrami I've ever had), was fatty, gristly, greasy and tasteless. Big rinds of fat layered on the sandwich, so much so that it was more of a fat sandwich than meat. There were no peppercorns and no seasoning in the meat. Just fatty. Where I come from, pastrami is bold and flavorful. This was disgusting. I hope that my experience is unique, because I'd heard great things about Chompie's and I'm still feeling sick to my stomach.  The photo is of the slices of meaty fat that comprised my sandwich.",

There was a disorganized line to order, wasn't clear where to order or who to order from as there were many employees scurrying about behind the counter.  There was product everywhere on the counter and on tables in the line area, very cluttered.  Waited for someone to finally acknowledge that I was next in line to order.  None of the 5-7 people behind the counter were very attentive.  Finally a lady approached the register but starts putting in some other order, says she'll be with me in a moment.  Another lady comes over and asks me what I wanted, finds a piece of paper to write the order down on.  Goes to another register and apparently enters the order.  Walks me down to a different register where she advises the cashier that my order is in the system under my name.  I pay for the sandwich and am told it will be out shortly.  At least 6-7 people paid and received their orders before mine, all of which were bigger orders than my one sandwich.  One guy named Mitch came in, everybody behind the counter knew him and acknowledged him, and he got his order and was on his way before me and all those waiting, obviously preferential treatment, but that's fine.  Another 15 min go by and no sandwich.  Several different people behind the counter finally asked me what I ordered.  Clearly the order was lost.  Another 5 min and I finally get my sandwich.  The whole thing took about 30 min.  Good thing it was Sunday and didn't have to be anywhere important.  Finally get home and my sandwich is what I ordered, but had NO flavor whatsoever, super disappointed.",

The only thing that we felt was weak were the 2 plates of pickles which were straggly looking.  I will also comment that the deli, bagel, and bakery goods area of this Shea location is much nicer and fresher looking than the Tempe and Chandler locations, now that I have bought and tasted from all 3. This location by far is the best food quality location.  Chompies is the best New York style deli in Arizona, hands down.",

Would have liked more pricing information (like you charge by the person and count a 4 year old the same as an adult) and confirmation regarding how many people would actually be eating the lox.  Especially since I ordered additional items for people, but you still priced them in the \"total count\". Then when I see the platter is amazing that it for \"11 people\".  Had a similar platter for 4 people before (gifted to us, so not sure how they were charged....but would guess $80).  Would love to see an explanation on how they prep/portion the tray by person (since they price by person). Will post the picture. Didn't appreciate my conversation with one of the \"managers\" either.  I'll be contacting upper management for all this and more feedback.  Happy Mother's Day to the chompie corp",

The menu is HUGE though so it took us a while to read through it and decide what we wanted to order. I got the lunch meatloaf and she got the Arizona Benedict and both were delicious. The food came out quickly and the presentation was nice. Our server was very knowledgeable about the menu and very patient with how long it took us to decide what to get and answered our questions. She was great and an awesome server. The restaurant itself is much larger than I expected and has a full bakery as well which is really cool. The restaurant is decorated as a New York theme and is well put together. There are so many nice touches such as pickles brought to the table at the start of the meal and little desserts brought to the table at the end of the meal. We will go back again.",

When I got home and opened my container.... the sandwich was so greasy you could see the oil just soakec onyo the bread.  I opened the container of onion strings and they were pretty much the same.... overcooked and very greasy.  I don't live very far; so, it wasn't from the long drive.  The cook just overcooked my food.  It should have been thrown away and recooked.  I can't believe they let it go and served it.  I'm disgusted.   $15.99 for a greasy overcooked sandwich and $7.99 for greasy overcooked onion strings that I landed up throwing away.  The only time I will ever go back to Chompies is when I want a bagel; which, is not that often.  They do have really good bagels.",

We liked that we could eat breakfast at any time of the day which is pretty common for this type of restaurant mostly found on the east coast. They allow for lots of modification on entrees and are pretty lenient when it comes to substitutions.   For example I used to get an egg white omelette with 4 or 5 fillings - and most servers went out of their way input the order in the most cost effective way.    I recently went to Chompies to get some bakery items which I have never done before.  The cookies and cupcakes are visually very appealing and look and taste fresh.  These make for a nice leave behind at meetings or sales calls.",

I had the Hot Pastrami (Half) with potato salad.  - that sandwich made me utter OMG's with each bite....all the way to the very end...and even then I was eating morsels of pastrami that had dropped on the plate.  And the fresh baked Jewish Rye bread....OMG's once again.  The best choice to have with the pastrami. 2.  My wife had the turkey sandwich (Half) and she too was raving over how fresh and good it tasted and she had it on the Marble Rye bread. 3.  I chose potato salad for my side. - potato salad was ok...a bit above average but it could have used a bit more seasoning of flavors. 4.  My wife chose the Coleslaw.  The Coleslaw actually outdid the potato salad.  In fact, I did not order the Coleslaw because generally speaking the only good restaurant Coleslaw to be found is in the Southern restaurants - they know how to make darn good Coleslaw.  Well, Chompie's Coleslaw was definitely up there with Southern Coleslaw.  I will order it the next time for my side. 5.  Robert was our wait person today.  His attention to everything was definitely a 5 star performance.  And watching and listening to Robert attend to and check on each and every guest he was serving was done with attention to detail all the while not missing a step.  Kudos to Robert today for the fine service.  There you have it.....my 5 reasons for giving a rating of 5 stars.  Would I go back?  Yes.  The only problem is it looks like it might take me at least 3 years to try all the many delicious things that I saw on the menu today....and breakfast is another whole story.",

Today, it was time for something a little different for lunch. I was sick of eating leftovers or a Trader Joe's salad. I hopped onto Yelp and read some of the reviews of this place since it seems that Chompie's has quite the reputation around town.  I pulled up the menu and was surprised to find out that there is a \"Fitness Boot Camp\" menu. Most items here are reasonable...somewhat. This is a Jewish deli afterall....a glutton's paradise. I ordered the Mile High Turkey Pastrami on Multi Grain Bread with Fruit Salad. My tomato, lettuce and onion was all on the side. No condiments on the sandwich. Perfect. I didn't need to request it this way. Thank God.  When I came in to pick it up, the person who prepared my sandwich, opened up the box, went over my sandwich with me to make sure it was everything I asked for. AWESOME SERVICE.  I walked out of there with a smile.   The sandwich was delicious. The turkey pastrami was NOT dry, the bread was fresh, the fruit was perfect, and I was a very happy camper.   I can't wait to come back! Chompie's....you are awesome. Challah!",

After she made my bagel, she touched everything with the same gloves on -- the register, money, the pen, counter.  (The register is never cleaned and is touched by every employee, and the pen is touched by nearly every customer.).  Then she did not change her gloves after ringing me up and will make the next customer's food.  That is SO gross.  I can only imagine what she touched before making my bagel.  What is the point of wearing gloves when you do not change them between touching common items such as pens and registered and MONEY!  Money is incredibly dirty. I am repulsed.  Chompie's needs to work on their food handling and glove use protocol.",

    "text": "Yikes, this location is getting rough. I love Chompies, but I don't think I will becoming to this location anymore.  The last time I was here was on a Friday night, which happens to be a night when they have fish tacos and unlimited fish and chips and while the servers kept saying they were \"really busy\" we were sat right away while noticing other empty tables. The host took and delivered our drink orders letting us know that our server was taking a \"smoke break\", which I guess was nice because we knew it would be a bit before he came over. Anyway, we were able to figure out our entrees by the time our server got to us and my husband went for the Reuben sandwich and I went for the fish and chips, but then I was denied because \"they were out and it would take 30 minutes\". Bummed out, so I opted for chicken strips (kind of similar, right?).   Our entrees were delivered and while my husband's plate was the standard we've come to expect, the chicken strips were something you would see at a truck stop diner. Not only were they tasteless and dry, but they were DISCOLORED. Like the discoloration you get from freezer burn. I was going to wait for our waiter since, traditionally they always check on you soon after entrees are delivered, but instead we had to flag down the busboy to get our waiter. When he arrived and we told him the disappointment, he stood there saying \"what do you want me to do, do you want to talk to a manger?\". No sympathy or embarrassment from the low quality meal, just confusion from him. Naturally, we said, \"yes, send the manager over\". Well, he had the same reaction, \"what would you like me to do?'. I don't know if this is the new way the food industry deals with issues, but I find appalling that they ask the customer what to do. I would think one would be embarrassed enough to take the plate away, offer a new version of the plate, offer a completely different entree, anything rather than \"what do you want me to do\" about it type attitude. By that time, 30 minutes had passed, so when it was up to us to decide what should happen after the terrible chicken strips, my husband suggested to fish and chips and the manager said \"okay\".   When that meal arrived, I was blown away by the difference in both taste and appearance, why couldn't this had happened sooner? Ugh, anyway after we \"complained\" it seemed our drinks were to suffer with not being refilled and I also wasn't asked by the waiter if this meal was okay or any better.  The service was sub-par, but I did get to exchange my meal which was nice, but that was only after a horrible meal. I don't know about this location anymore. I don't want to come back.",

    "text": "I had a new experience today.  For the first time in my 4 decades of life, I left a restaurant without eating there because I was mad,  and it was this Chompie's.  I was actually looking for a location to host a Meetup group that I'm the organizer for.  I saw that Tuesday was \"Kids Eat Free\" night so my 2 1/2 year old son and I went to check it out.  It was a beautiful night and we wanted to sit outside.  The tables were all set up on the patio  but apparently the server did not want us to eat outside because she was training someone and it would make it harder.  Our hostess went and asked another server, who also was not able or willing to serve us outside.  So, our options were to eat inside or to get it as takeout and sit out on one of the picnic-like tables outside without service.  We elected for the takeout, even though it was not the most convenient thing in the world to juggle the food with a toddler clinging to my leg.  When I went to pay for the takeout, I was charged for the Kids Meal, too.  I brought up the \"Kids Eat Free\" and she said that was only for dining in, but she would ask the manager because of our circumstance.  She came back and said no, that the Kids Meal would not be free.  I think she was actually trying, the only person there I can say that about.  By that point, I was so annoyed that we went to Sprouts, got some nice, fresh strawberries, and went home, made our own sandwiches and opened a can of soup.  Probably healthier anyway, though I had been looking forward to trying the Reuben and the matzo ball soup.  I'd imagine they didn't care much because I was not a big ticket customer with one adult and a free Kids Meal.  But with that experience, there is absolutely no way I will go back, much less host a large group there.  I called Paradise Bakery and they have a room we can reserve if we have enough people.  Problem solved.",

    "text": "My husband and I both come from great Jewish Deli states (Michigan and NYC.)  We both know what good Jewish Deli should taste like and Chompies is.....OK.  I can forgive the bread.  I understand that on this side of the country it is simply impossible to make really good bread because of the water.  Chompies rye bread and bagels are actually the best I've tasted in Arizona.  What I can't forgive is the corned beef and pastrami.  They are both so chewy and fatty and I don't understand why, even if I order it lean it still comes out extremely fatty!  To be honest every time I've tried a sandwich from Chompies I've been disappointed.    When we go here my husband usually orders a cheeseburger, he loves Chompies cheeseburgers, their fries and coleslaw are also very good.  I usually get a chopped liver appetizer.  Their chopped liver is amazingly good; it reminds me of my childhood making chopped liver with my grandma in her kitchen!  My new love at Chompies is the brisket sliders, they are yummy!  Their brisket is really really good and it's a huge amount of food! I always take at least one home.   I'm going to try the western sliders next time we go, I'm sure they'll be as good as the original.  I go to Chompies at least once or twice a month to pick up a ridiculous amount of smoked fish for my husband and me to eat over the weekend.  They have all the classic smoked fishes you'd expect at a Jewish Deli, my personal favorite is sable; yes it is worth $40 a pound :)  Their whitefish salad is also really good, it has large pieces of white fish in it and scallions.  They also have a lot of different flavors of cream cheese including my husband's favorite, olive pimento.  The bakery section takes me back to my childhood.  It reminds of going to the Jewish Bakery on Friday mornings with my mother to get bread for Shabbat dinner.  It doesn't hurt that they have my favorite apricot hamentacshen!",

If you think about it, you really have to go out of your way to screw up breakfast but they managed.  We knew we were off to a bad start when we stood at the entrance for about 5 minutes (Please Wait to be Seated) for someone to seat us in a 1/2 empty dining room. The waiter was attentive so no problems there. The problems started when the food arrived. 3 of us had menu variations of corn-beef hash and poached eggs. The corn-beef had the look and texture of road kill and the eggs were hard boiled. 2 of us requested that the eggs be re-done but only one of us received it after assurances from the wait staff that it was \"on its way...\". The food was also more or less room temp when it arrived.  To be fair, there are a lot of Chompie's and maybe this was a bad day at a singe location. The menu is extensive and I did see other customers orders that looked more appetizing. It would appear that they have good food but the execution was the problem. We might try it again and order something different.",

The servings were large, and the service very prompt and friendly.  Most importantly, the prices were more than reasonable.  The only thing that I disliked, was that they did not have hash browns.  They do have potatoes as an option with the meals, but you cannot actually classify them as hash browns.  They are good - but not quite a replacement for hash browns and gravy.  I actually like it so much, that I stopped and had breakfast two days later on the way to the golf course.  Again, great breakfast at very reasonable prices.  Although I usually don't eat lunch, I am going to have to make an effort to stop in and try their lunch menu. And their deli counter, and all the different varieties of bagels.",

    "text": "Being the nice Jewish girl that I am, I love good Jewish food.  Finding this place was the closest thing I could get to good home cooked Jewish food.  Its not the greatest deli I have eaten at, BUT, I think its the most authentic deli that the valley has to offer!   The portions are huge, wide selection of food, deserts and deli cases.  They also offer Holiday dinners for those of you who may be Jewish and not have family out here to celebrate those holidays with.  I reccomend it!  They are quite expensive tho!",

    "text": "I have been to this deli many times in the past....obviously it was good enough to go back with family.  It was not good at all.  Wait to be seated...good...busy is a good thing.  The time from the order to delivery was more than 40 minutes and we had soup salad and what wound up being cold sandwiches.  The place emptied out and we were receiving the food st 2:45 in the afternoon.  Brisket was cold and dry, chicken soups were not warm and salty.  The server was either overwhelmed or out of his element.  Bad day, maybe..not a new restaurant...their attitude was ...pullemin seatem.....collect that money....no one watching this kitchen...lots of important people walking the dining room",

Within less than a minute, an employee (Robert) came up to ask if I needed anything. He was extremely friendly and showed me where the cookies were (I missed them over by the cashier- oops), and asked which ones I wanted for her. Honestly, I can't remember the last time I went somewhere where the people working had such genuine smiles. He was super sweet and the cookies were great. Just the customer service alone makes me want to go back. :)",
