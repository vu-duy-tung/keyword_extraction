    "text": "I've been to Pan Asian, one of the few Chinese/Japanese/Thai(?) places nearby.  I was looking to see how this place compared.  So, a couple quick pluses noted right away: it was smaller and more intimate, and while there were a few TVs mounted on the walls, I didn't hear them.  I could hear Asian music.  That was good--I was in a mood for quiet.  But as I waited this Sunday night to be seated, several minutes went by and no one greeted me.  And they weren't that crowded.  Finally a young man came over to seat me.  He didn't smile, barely made eye contact, and seemed more interested in watching the TV than in seating me.  And it wasn't like it was the World Series on!  So I'm seated at a quiet booth and get dinner and drink menus.  The waitress comes shortly to take my drink order.  Very nice.  No beer on tap though--only bottles.  I head to the restroom and get assailed by a smell that smells like it was backed up to a sewer pipe. And all they have is a little air freshener device.  I don't think it's going to do it, folks.  I go back and select everything off the Japanese menu.  I order miso soup.  There a wide variety of traditional sushi rolls and some \"nouveau\" stuff, like the cream cheese in rolls and so forth.  I ordered a few different rolls.  The miso soup was good, with plenty of big pieces of nori.  The various rolls were well-wrapped.  Tasty, nothing particularly artistic about them.  The most interesting was one with mango on top with some sauce, that was very colorful and flavorful.  The server came around a couple times to see how things were.  So--Pan Asian may be a bit more noisy and big, but it's classier and seems cleaner and the waitstaff are more pleasant.  Seeing as they're both near each other, I'd go back there, not here",

    "text": "A friend told us about this place a year ago when we moved into the area from Mesa. Today we finally got around to trying it. After trying a little takeout place in the area I was scared to try any other Asian food near here. This whole year I have been making excuses to go back into Mesa/Tempe for my old favorites, Ninja and Pong Pongs.  I liked the interior. The patio was very well decorated but it was still just a tad too warm to sit outside. Really liked the plates and salt shakers too. Anyways, I was there for food,and the place was clean and visually pleasing. More than good enough for me.  I can't complain about the service. We were seated right away. The waitress was pleasant and stopped to take our order 3 times before we could decide what we wanted. Our glasses were always full and I didn't feel like we waited too long for anything at any point.  The crab rangoon was great. I wanted to try some soup but actually forgot to order any...  I normally judge a new place by ordering my favorite, Kung Pao Chicken. This time I was in the mood for something sweet and ordered the Sweet & Sour Chicken. I have to say, it was great. The chicken was tender and not chewy. The batter was crispy and the sauce was perfect (for my tastes).  My lunch companion had the Shrimp Egg Foo Yung and I managed to steal a taste. I've never had Egg Foo Yung before and it was great. I'm going to have to get it for myself on a future trip. I'm a very texture-based eater and I love water chestnuts (crunchy and moist) and mushrooms and the Egg Foo Yung had plenty of both.  Overall, Sun Asian Kitchen was an extremely pleasant surprise. I am so happy to have found such a good place with good food in this area. I cannot wait to go again and try something else from the menu.",

    "text": "I am a fan of this place, but only because this is the only place around to eat decent sushi. i used to go to Pan Asia which was down the road from this place but they shut down :( My experiences here aren't too bad. The place is clean, and always packed during lunch. A huge + is that they deliver on orders over $20 or $25.  Their portions and taste of the food are good. I tend to get the Twice Cooked Pork lunch which comes with fried rice and an egg roll. I must admit I always order that and sometimes sushi. The lunch combo is like $6.99 so it's not bad for what you get. I am giving this 3 stars for one reason only. The service and attitude of the workers. When I walk in of I am greeted and promptly my group and I are seated, and they take our drink order. But after that, the attitudes roll downhill. They do not come by and refill your drinks, when you flag someone down to ask for a refill they give this \"don't f'en talk to me look\", when they do come by they set your drink down hard and walk away. They are quick to give you your bill and walk away, not asking if you want anything else.  This last time I went on 11/14/2014 during the lunch rush, my co-worker ordered water as her beverage. The employee sat our drinks down, but they added lemon to her water. When trying to explain that she was allergic to lemon, that same employee looked like she didn't understand and gave one of the most bitchiest looks I have seen. I recommend take out or delivery during the lunch rush.",

Their lunch menu is cheap and they have so many options and flavors are on point! I always get the lemon chicken with fried rice lunch combo, which comes with a veggie egg roll. The portion size is very generous, and I always pick it up piping hot and fresh. Some Chinese restaurants will make lemon chicken with overly breaded chicken, but this place uses real chunks of chicken and is lightly breaded, so when you take a bite, you see a big piece of chicken and not all fried breading. The lemon sauce is perfectly sweet, tangy, sour, just the way it should be. The fried rice is good and not too greasy. The veggie egg roll is a nice size and comes with sweet and sour sauce which is always good! For less than $7 bucks, this place is definitely a winner!",

They acted like they didn't care  at all. When thwy finally replaced it and then the second batch tasted like fish also. I called to talk to a manager. He didn't care, talked over me the whole time on the phone. He asked if I wanted to come get my money. I didn't feel like driving for a third time. I said no, I was going to offer he give me a credit for next time. Instead, before I got the chance to say it, he hung up on me. I am done. I will never go back again.",

    "text": "This fusion restaurant is a must visit. Hey, there's actual Asians working in that kitchen! Strange! The service used to be fairly robotic, but they have dialed it in over the years. This is the only restaurant that we have ever frequented that we actually ordered more food when we were full just so we could have leftovers. Their hot and sour soup is the best in the universe. The residual heat from it has staying power. The squid salad is so good that it makes me want to cry. I wish that I had a refrigerator full of their egg rolls. I could eat those every day of the week. The honey chicken is my friend. I still think that it is bizarre that there are Egyptian hieroglyphics decorating the walls but I hope that never changes!",

I don't think we will go back there in the future. Pretty sad we really liked the place and seeing the quality of food gets diminishing....",

We stumbled on this restaurant surprised on all that they have to offer. The moment you walk in your greeted and seated. The theme is Asian with smaller size tables and chairs. Plenty of room for large parties or dining for two. Patio seating outside with plenty of room. There are tons of servers and staff on deck so your drinks/order comes quick. I am now a frequent diner from the great first experience I had. I have only eaten the chicken dishes along with rice and/or the lo Mein noodles. My dining partners have tasted the fish which I am told was great. I have only been here during lunch. They offer some reasonable and filling lunch specials. Defiantly a place I would recommend.",

First time we came there was an extremely loud argument with one of their customers and instead of trying to defuse the situation the employees egg them on and make matters worse with threats of violence and calling the police. The second time I didn't appreciate the service so I didn't want to leave a tip so the waitress decided to guilt me into leaving one and even showed me how much I should be leaving. The food wasn't that good to begin with, the rice was dry, burnt, and all around flavorless; and on top of everything it felt as though the waitress was trying to get rid of us as soon as we got there. I've worked in the food industry before so I know how stressful and draining It can be but this was just terrible all around and I definitely won't be coming back. Also found multiple black spots in my food and I had no idea what they were and there was a cockroach maybe five yards away from our table, honestly looked as though they tried to hide it.",

Got there decided to order one more item. Orange chicken at last min for hubby. I only waited another 10 mins which was ok. It was definitely  worth the wait. They were busy but I was glad to wait. Food was awesome hot and fresh and delicious by time I got home. And large portions  had leftovers for lunch Saturday.  Staff at register was courteous  and friendly as always.

    "text": "I was in the mood for some Sushi so checked out this restaurant on a Thursday evening. It wasn't too busy but not too quiet either. We were sat right away by a window and ordered the following: Age Tofu (delicious), Crab Rangoon had no crab (literally just cream cheese), Pad Thai (it was a good entree but not really pad thai due to no flavors of peanut dressing, lime, or fish sauce. It also contained peppers and onions but no bean sprouts. I ordered the Las Vegas roll which was excellent btw and although I didn't plan on ordering desert it would've been nice to have been asked. I guess our waitress wanted us out asap even though it wasn't close to closing time yet. I could tell she was in a hurry when she brought the check over along with a to-go box we'd asked for and the fortune cookies. She proceeded to hang out really close and asked twice if we were ready. So, if you want to chat after your meal I guess hurry up and pay first! LOL Overall the food was OK to great depending on what you order and the service was just OK. We'll come back because they had good sushi and there is nothing closer to us for sushi, otherwise we'd probably skip Sun Asian in the future.",

I ordered a Long Island ice tea and then told them to wait until happy hour to bring me my next one which was about half a hour. A hour later and the drink never came so when the waitress finally showed up I just asked for her to split the check and not to bring me the drink. She can back with the drink a half hour later and I told her I didn't wanted it. We just wanted to leave because we were sitting there for two hours already. She comped the drink then brought back the tab which was also not split. The food was very good but the wait staff needs to be more attentive. This place wasn't busy so not sure why it was so difficult to check on the patio table area.",

    "text": "Alright - I am going to update this review because Sun Asian Kitchen is a frequent stop for me.  No it's not the best (Chinese) food I have ever eaten. But their sushi is pretty darn great, plus they have a bar, iced mochas (not joking), Americanized Food items, and they deliver.  I recently just got their Sushi Salad (Tuna, White Tuna, Mango, Avocado, crisp lettuce, shredded carrots, cherry tomatoes and a spicy sweet sauce) and it was heaven. I am updating my review just because of this.  I gotta give them props, since they're in South Phoenix. We're lucky they exist out here.  You keep up the good fight Sun Asian Kitchen, and I'll ordering delivery from you (since it's hot and I am too lazy to drive).  Recommended:  Happy Hour - It's cheap Drinks - Fun times Delivery - Awesome convenience Sushi - Pretty tasty  Not: The Chinese Food (unless you do like Americanized Chinese Food)",

Went for lunch... got my usual of kung pao tofu with white rice and veggie egg roll.  My husband ordered 2 pc. tuna nigiri, 2 pc. salmon nigiri, 2 pc. yellowtail nigiri.  The reason he ordered this is because walking in there was a big dry erase board above the sushi chef and it said, \"Daily special  Nigiri 99 cent/ 1 pc.  Yellowtail $1.50/ 1 pc.\"  When we ordered we specified that he was getting the daily special and how many of each kind.    When we got the bill he was charged $16 for 6 pc of sushi when it should have been $7.  When I pointed out the mistake I was told that the white board special is happy hour specials.  I pointed out that no where on the white board did it specify that there was a time that the specials were good for.  I also pointed out that it was specified at the time of order that we were getting the daily special and pointed with my finger to the white board.  The woman still charged us the $16.  She got a $0 tip.  Well Sun Asian, you just lost a big local customer.  You will never see us again.",

Take out is fast, easy, and always correct - making this a worthwhile place to grab food if you're in a hurry.",

I'm a server myself and I know Asians are slow but that service was rediculous I didn't see my server besides when she took my order and dropped off my food.  Besides the service the food was aweful!!!! I was so excited for my sushi which was fine... but it was suppose to come out before the rest of my food.. which it didnt. So I had a few piece and decided to try my teriyaki chicken DO NOT EAT! first bite tasted hard and for some reason like an uncooked piece of broccoli had to spit it out. Tried another piece thinking it was just a bad piece and nope another bad bite. It made me lose my appetite so I walked outside to get some air and had to turn right around and run to the bathroom to throw up! Which I repeated 3 times before finally getting the bill that I asked for more than once!   I could understand if it was busy but there was maybe 3 other couples there.. also this isn't the first time I've been there but it seems to keep getting worse every time I go. Will not be returning after my food poisoning and lack there of concern or discount of bill for food I couldn't even eat.",

They have probably the best happy hour I have ever seen that lasts from 3pm-7pm then 9pm-Close, and is SEVEN DAYS A WEEK. The HH menu includes single pieces of sushi for $0.99, rolls for $3, and a variety of other fried appetizers for a few bucks (including fried tofu and vegetable dumplings that are vegan friendly) in addition to a ton of cheap ass booze. You can get a sake bomber with Kirin/Kirin Light for $3.85. Beers (domestic and import) are under $2, cocktails are $5, and they even have scorpion bowls!  The staff has been very friendly and quick to answer questions, and the service is always quick.   The decor is totally funky inside, which I personally like. it has a lot of character. They also have a really nice patio that is great for beautiful days and day drinking!  Their regular menu is really expansive and I've only had the kung pao tofu, but it was really good.   They have free delivery with a $25 minimum, but only specific hours. M-F 11a-3p/5p-8p and Sat/Sun 12-8p. You can fax or email your order in too, which I think is pretty cool. Delivery is from 16th ave - 48th street, Broadway to Dobbins.   Thank god we have Sun Asia because there is practically nothing else in South Phoenix. Definitely hit this place up if you are in the area!!!",

Ps:  if you have little kids get them the calamari and tell them it's chicken sticks. They will never know the difference and you get to see them try a new food while you get to enjoy yours.",

Don't listen to the other reviews, cmon you know if the review is about orange chicken then it was given by a basic person who only eats orange chicken. This restaurant has many options to choose from, my favorite is the pepper steak with mushrooms. The mussels are also delicious with Siracha sauce as well as their sushi rolls!  They happy hour is amazing , I can sit at the bar all day and leave with a small tab and a full stomach because they have happy hour on appetizers as well! Well anyways if you a foodie like me this a must to try!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I go here probably once a week.  From the outside, it looks terribly dodgy, but on the inside the restaurant is quite lovely.  The owners have obviously invested considerable capital in this place, getting custom-made metal work, etc.  Our first visit: Sweet and sour chicken - what I order whenever I'm trying a new Chinese restaurant - isn't awesome, but it was good enough to make me come back.  My boyfriend got a beef dish; his only complaint was that there was too much meat and not enough vegetables.    The chicken skewers appetizers are soso, but the dumplings are very tasty.  Recommend pan-fried over steamed, though either are yummy.   I rarely stray from the almond chicken.  It is the perfect dish, with the chicken & veggies (zuchinni, mushrooms, water chestnuts, onions & peppers) in perfect proportion, all in delicious brown sauce that has just enough ginger to be perfectly palate-cleansing (instead of cloying, as some brown sauces can be).  The almonds, toasted, are a great additional 'crunch' in the dish.  Other dishes we've had: string bean beef and chicken are two of my boyfriend's favorites.  Chicken & vegetables are yummy, as is the double cooked (or double fried) chicken.  My mother, when she visited, had egg foo yung with beef and thought it was awesome.    Service is exceptional.  They're always happy to provide a pitcher of water when I ask for it, and if I forget to ask, my glass doesn't ever stay empty for long.",

    "text": "YUCK! ick! ewwwww! would be how I'd describe my lunch at Sun Asian Kitchen. Whatever was served was albeit presentable but in terms of taste not good at all. I ordered the wonton soup and the Honey Chicken combo (comes with a chicken eggroll, and choice of fried rice, steamed rice or lo mein, brown rice is extra). The wonton soup had a weird taste to it, the broth was alright and the vegetables included in the soup canned. The Honey Chicken combo arrived shortly after, and it looked promising. And what goodness it seemed to offer ended after the first bite. I know how to cook fried rice, and yes, fried rice is made with day old rice but what I had was the rice at the bottom of the pan, there were hard bits to it that would stick to my teeth and there was no flavor to it, as for flavor, the honey chicken had nothing close to it being honey chicken, and the dish tasted off. It was a mess. I was hoping to at least enjoy the chicken minus the lackluster fried rice but the fried pieces of chicken was mostly batter and less chicken. And the sauce was just too sweet and thick that I really didn't know what I was eating hence I just stopped eating and considered my lunch a loss. =( I agree with a yelper that sun asian kitchen is a step above fast food but if I were to compare this tragedy with Panda Express, I'd take Panda over this hot mess. Overall my experience at Sun Asian Kitchen was bad sauce, and wouldn't recommend this place to anyone at all. I'm sorry Sun Asian Kitchen, you're a bad news bear. =(",

    "text": "Ok. A full star is generous but this site only allows 1 star increments. I've been to this place 3 times, hoping that service will either improve or balance out. I like to support \"mom and pop\" places and local restaurants which is why I gave it several opportunities to make up for poor service. But to my disappointment, this is the last straw. I show up for a bite to eat with a friend around 9pm on a Monday night which is typically the slowest night of the week for most restaurants. As soon as we received our menus we were already expected to give our order. After asking for a few more minutes to decide, the waitress comes back in less than a minute, urging us to make a decision. Strike 1. Next after ordering our food, we receive our orders in a reasonable amount of time. By now it's about 9:15. The food is mediocre as usual but that can be forgiven to a certain degree. While I'm still eating the last few bites of my food, the waitress is tugging at my plate to take it away. I had to stop her and tell her that I wasn't quite finished. Strike 2. She came back a couple of minutes later dropped off the check and packed the few leftovers. By now it's around 9:30. My friend and I were in the middle of a conversation when she rudely interrupted to ask to close the check. I glanced at my watch to be mindful of the time they close which was 10pm...it was 9:35. Strike 3. At this point, enough is enough. I asked for a manager to let her know of the poor service and I was suddenly surrounded by the remaining wait staff which stood there waiting for me to act crazy or something. After politely speaking my dissatisfaction, my friend and I left vowing never to return and encourage others to do the same. In this economic climate, you would think that frequent customers would save establishments like this. However, to create frequent customers, they would have to be encouraged to come back!! I am amazed how this place stays in business. Mediocre food (at best), rather high prices, and poor service. If you want to pour money into local businesses, pour it somewhere else because this establishment could care less.",

    "text": "Ok, I rarely give establishments one star, especially not when I initially gave the place three stars or above. I will have to make an exception for Sun Asian Kitchen. The first time my husband and I went there (the experience I based my first review on), the food definitely wasn't outstanding or authentic, but it was decent. The fact that it was the only non-hole-in-the-wall Asian place in South Phoenix also made me settle on a solid three stars.   Last night, on my way back from Tucson, my husband called in an order and I went to pick it up. We got the crab wontons, chicken chow fun, and Mongolian beef. When I got home with the food (after waiting 10 extra minutes for the food to be ready), we sat down to eat, ready for some standard but satisfying Chinese.   Well, we were in for a big disappointment. The food was awful, literally disgusting. To start with, the chicken in the chow fun was literally formed and the farthest thing from breast you can get - my husband said it reminded him of the way the chicken meat in McNuggets used to be before they upgraded to all white meat. I figure if McDonalds can make the switch, so can this place. I picked out all the chicken, hoping that the chow fun would at least be decent, but it was super-oily, so much so it was almost inedible. The crab wontons had literally two flecks of artificial crab in them and were basically stuffed with straight cream cheese. Not good. The beef was also terrible quality, the only saving grace of the dish being the flavorful sauce and scallions. We both felt really sick after the little we did eat and wished that we had taken our $25 and gone to Panda Express instead. Yeah, it was that bad.   The biggest irony of all is that the restaurant actually claims that they use top-quality meat. On their website, they state that they only use  \"top quality meat, seafood  and  the  freshest  garden vegetables to cook your food  to ensure  an authentic and memorable eating experience.\" Yeah. Right. I know there's a recession going on, but serving meat worse than McDonald's is inexcusable and will certainly keep us from spending our valuable food dollars there. A place called Pan Asia (advertises itself is having sushi and Chinese fusion) is about to open up across the street (24th and Baseline) in the center; it will be exciting to have another Asian restaurant in South Phoenix to choose from, and I hope that the competition will force Sun Asian Kitchen to live up to their own promise to use only the highest-quality ingredients.",

An hour later, they called and asked if I still wanted my food. At 7:30 (2.5 hours after I placed my order), the food finally got here. I called and talked to the woman, and she fought with me on the phone and blamed the situation on me for saying after 2 hours that I still wanted my food. Go down the street to PanAsia.

The lady who answers the phone who I really like because she's the friendliest of all the employees I've spoken to is the one who told me that it could not be used on the Lunch Menu items. Oh well, since they're already less than $6 anyways, I didn't mind.   I might actually go get some of their Hunan Chicken for lunch, but I'm waiting til' the lunch crowd thins a bit.",

The containers they put soup in leak, I ordered two orders tonight, asked that they make sure they don't leak and they said no problem, I got home with two containers of wontons, shrimp etc AND NO LIQUID all the liquid was on my floorboards I called she said sorry no one has complained I COMPLAINED WHEN I ORDERED & PICKED IT UP!   I live less than a mile from Panda Express I wanted soup so I drove 8 miles each way in 5pm Baseline traffic only to get home after 6 with a ruined meal and dirty car. I will not be back and suggest no one else go there as they do not care.",

I was playing it on the safe side when I went so I only had the happy hour specials which was a  really good spicy tuna roll and some pork with some peanut sauce on top. It was really good I dont even like pork! The appetizers were really good now I'm curious what the rest of their menu is like.",

This place has awesome happy hour and reverse happy hour specials. $2 Sapporo and Kirin, 99 cent nigiri and $4 rolls. I'm not going to lie to you, this is not sushi for sushi snobs, and I have sushi snob friends that refuse to go here. But if you're not...I have eaten here over a dozen times and only 1 visit was the fish a little under par. The service is quite good and the sushi comes out pretty fast.   The restaurant itself is cute and well decorated with a nice ambiance. It is nice to have a place like this in South Phoenix with cheaper prices (and WAY better music) than the place down the road.",

    "text": "We're all clear that wanting to like something is not the same as liking it, right?  Well, I want to love this place.  It's the closest non-take out Chinese food place to my house so I was completely ready to make this \"My Chinese Restaurant\".  Unfortunately it doesn't quite live up to the hype.    It is all good.  It's fine.  Some parts better than others.  Entrees are in the $8 range for chicken/beef dishes, in the $16 range for seafood and they offer a few specialty dishes up to the early $20's.  They have a decent section of vegetarian things as well, but less than you might expect at a Chinese restaurant.  There was more \"sweet\" in the sesame chicken than in the Orange chicken - and they looked far too much like the same thing.    The interior is kinda cool with funky lamps, window hangings and lots of bamboo.  For a spot that size the bar, where you can also sit and eat, is a bit too big for me - but just because those 2 big screen tv's are pointing out to the rest of the restaurant so we can't help but be reminded it's there.  The service?  Not so bueno.  I've been there 3 times and once it was good, but not great.  The other times have been pretty off each time.    I read a great review about the place by a professional reviewer claiming that it was similar to San Francisco Chinese food fare.  I'm guessing he's wrong, but I wanted to put it out here for other folks to see. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.somonews.com%2Farticle.cfm%3FarticleID%3D242&s=904ed143296630b96cefbe2d2c54be226661a5570a78908475235e2660e6b49f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">somonews.com/article.cfm...</a>  I'd love to hear what you Bay area transplants have to say...",

After a moment of deliberation, I decided to break free from my regular lunch spots and try something new.  There was a small line to be seated so the hostess asked us if we wanted to sit outside instead of waiting for a spot inside. We accepted her offer and were seated immediately. As soon as I sat in my chair my server was there with menus, ready to take drink orders. She brought us both glasses of water as requested and also brought a pitcher for us to refill with (nice touch as I hate waiting for refills on water).  We both placed our orders off of the very well priced lunch menu and waited less than 10 minutes for our food. Everything came out exactly as ordered and tasted great!   We were in and out of there in less than 30 minutes which is quite rare for a sit-down restaurant during busy lunch times. I was impressed with the service, speed and price at Sun Asian Kitchen and I recommend this place to anyone looking for a good meal at a good price without wasting your entire lunch hour.",

It attempts to be trendy but ends up looking like a loft apartment that was well-decorated, then occupied by someone's grandmother who didn't have the best taste. It is at least open and airy, though.  It is a semi-regular lunch spot for me and my co-workers, since it is really easy to get tired of going to Chipotle over and over on the corner of 24th and Baseline, and I refuse to go to Ono Hawaiian Grill. Yuck.  The staff is generally friendly and chipper, if a bit too informal. On a couple of occasions I have had to wait a while to be greeted at my table, but 90% of the time it is a quick in and out lunch.  The food is average-to-decent chinese fare with average sushi and a couple of other asian cuisines thrown in. It is nothing earth-shattering, but it is reliably decent.  I always order the veggies in garlic sauce, but substitute crispy fried tofu. The fried tofu is always well-seasoned and cooked just right. The rice is, let's be honest, mediocre shopping center chinese restaurant rice, but it is perfectly acceptable.  It is a great place to grab lunch for 7 or 8 bucks.",

We asked 3 times for our check, which took over 30 minutes to get.  It had the drinks on it that we never got.  We asked to talk to the manager 3 times and never had a response.  When I walked up to the bar to talk to the manager, she was also not apologetic and said they were just busy.  They were not that busy and even if they were, they still could apologize for the lack of service.  No apology from anyone, in fact, got attitude from all servers and manager.  So much, that when they brought my card and receipt back to me, the waitress literally threw my card and receipt at me!!!!! Can you believe that? She obviously has never had waitress/customer service etiquette 101. So completely rude of all staff members. Walked out so frustrated because I never got an apology for being at the restaurant for over 2 1/2 hours for a simple meal. Ridiculous. Will not go back.",

Then they didnt come back... didn't give me a pen to write on the sushi menu. Got my food, it was okay. But then waited for a Sprite  refill for a while. Then waited almost 20 mins for my bill. Saw 2 tables leave that were sat before me! Hen she finally set itdown, she had a mouthful of foods! Yuck! The ladies at the table near me, the waitress argued with them that they didnt water the drink down! As I was waiting, I saw fruit flies land on my plate.. Nope. Wont be back.",

I thought to myself,  who would know of a good place to grab a quick bite to eat, the answer was simple, my fellow \"yelpers\" and my fellow \"yelpers\" were right Sun Asian Kitchen was a nice little find.  From the time we entered the restaurant and received a warm welcome to the \"Please come again\" as we left out experience was very pleasant. The menu offers a wide choice of dishes wuch includes lunch and dinner specials.  All the food is fresh and excellent tasting, and the portions are large, I mean really large.  You get a great deal for your money! The barbecue pork and noodles, egg rolls, and egg drop soup were really very good.  The service is very fast and friendly. Sun Asian Kitchen has both booths and tables and they have take out.",

I mean I'm speaking $10+ a meal $40+ for entire bill and I drive home just to be disappointed. I called to make them aware of my incorrect order just to be told they're too busy to figure out if the kitchen or the person took the order. I'm just upset because now I just wasted $10 because I hate soggy food!!!! Other than that that food is really great and service has been great. Only one bad experience and two wrong orders in 10+ years is still 4 stars I just hope Tony make it right.",

They can be rude and they hover over you while you put down the tip and make a comment if its less then they liked. I always just brushed it off. Until one day the service was completely unacceptable and the server was extremely rude. The whole experience was really bad I decided I would not be tipping that night. I have never done this before although I have never had such bad experience either. The server notice this and said if you don't tip don't come back again and started yelling in another language. I will definitely not be returning. That is not how you treat your customers.",

Theeeen, when all the bills came, some of us like to pay with card and then leave a cash tip so, we lined through the \"tip line\" the server says, \"No, that's where you put the tip on that line.\" Dude, if we don't want to tip you for your awful and rude service, we don't have to!! Shameless. Trying to guilt patrons into tipping. First of all, we had multiple checks on the same table so, we had worked out who would be tipping and who wouldn't bc of how we had already worked it. Don't be so disrespectful to demand and guilt a tip when you got everything wrong on our table, food arrived way later than other parts of the table, and you couldn't even be bothered to bring us chopsticks. This place was terrible and the food was sub par at best.",

There's even sushi on the happy hour menu to go with your Tsing Tao. Staff is incredibly funny and willing to serve you whatever you order. I prefer to sit at the bar and be entertained. My go-to dish is the house lo mein and house fried rice. You should always order the crab rangoons, chicken dumplings (fried), coconut shrimp, and the beef satay. Servings are pretty plentiful. I must say, the coconut boba is the bomb. You really can't go wrong with any of the menu item. Come back often, come back a lot. Or just do take out since they offer online ordering!",

When checking out there is a tip option, I prefer to give my tips upon arrival. What if my order was wrong? What if they were over an hour late? So I always give tips when I receive my food. When the food was dropped off, the first thing out of the lady's mouth when I opened the door was \"You no left tip\" Wow, I wasn't ready for that. Not even a \"Hello\". I told her my reasoning and that I planning on giving a cash tip but that it's really rude to ask for a tip. She didn't care, she said it again, this time more aggressive.. \"You didn't leave tip\" So I reached into my wallet and handed her a $1. I was planning on giving 25% from my $50 dinner but I was so offended that she was trying to shame me that she lost out on her tip, and because of her, they also lost my business. It's not like I can't find another Chinese delivery option near me.",

Unfortunately, my love for their Mongolian beef has kept me choosing this dish over trying some of their others, which means I need to enlarge my dining experience here. I have had their kung pao veggies and did not enjoy it as much as I like Autumn Court's version of the dish.

They always have our lunches out quickly as they are conscious of our time crunch. Very good lunch specials and much less expensive than the alternative.",

I really like the honey chicken and the orange chicken, and it comes in a combo which is great.  The crab wontons are my favorite to order, full of cream cheese.  The sushi rolls are good also.",

The eggroll was not all cabbage, the beef and vegetables were quality and had good flavor. Slushee came in 20 oz. cup. Total bill...8.32----holla!! I will be back, believe dat:-)",

We get to the restaurant just after 11am - it's dead, if the TVs weren't on I could have heard chirping. We got seated, the hostes was very nice and took our order right away. Not even 2 minutes had passed when she brought out our meal...wow, what service. I orderd the Orange Chicken and enjoyed the texture and taste. The chicken meat was tender and the batter was crisp.   Enjoyed my meal and would come again!",

    "text": "Okay okay... let me be real with ya'll. I DID read the SoMo review back in the day when it first came out. Now, I had my Bay Area hopes & dreams and yeah - was a little disappoitned. But for real. It's a nice place. I hate it when reviews hype a place up only to be disappoitned because it wasn't cracked up to what it was supposed to be even though what it was - was actually really nice.   With that said. This is by FAR the nicest chinese resturant in this area! For real... show me a place that is more authentic AND more clean AND has better service THAT is in the South Mountain area. If you can... I'll give u $20!   If you do decide to go, you MUST try the Won Ton Soup! I love everything, the single shrimp that's always perfectly cooked with the aromatic broth with the stuffed won tons. It's my version of heaven. I always go here for the soup.   Some other favorite dishes are the Hunan chicken which has the right amount of spice and the baby corn is to die for! If you're not too adventerous then the Sweet & Sour is also good as is the Beef & Broccoli. I TOTALLY dig the Mongolian Beef which was suggested to me by a very friendly server.   I am so inlove with the decor and the teal plates and matching salt & pepper shakers and soy sauce pourer and platters. But as a big girl, I must admit... the chairs could be a lil more sterdier. I'm always scared that this is going to be the time I finally brake a chair! The menus are hard to read because of the frosty page covers. I always press the hazy plastic page protectors firmly over the paper and that usually makes it easier to read.   But all in all, it's a very nice place. I have taken quite a few of my friends there and have become somewhat of a regular. I have yet to finish a cup of water and soda because the servers are so attentative that they bring a fresh cup before my first one was even gone! The servers have always been willing to take special orders for me and are always willing to chime in on what they think the best dish is (when asked). I really love this place! :)",

Sun Asian kitchen serves great food and drinks at amazing prices, served by amazing people, in our amazing community. Happy hour is from 3-7 every day with sushi options, apetizers, cocktails, sake bombers, etc...   Whether you want to have a date night and have drinks at the bar, have a family party, or enjoy the patio with the misters to keep you cool, it is tough to beat sun asian kitchen.

First, we came in and were greeted by this lady that seem to lack a bit of optimism seeing us (probably had a long time at work). We sat down and got our menus really quick. Our waiter came right when we got seated and got us our waters.  Our waiter was nice...but forceful. He was nice with giving us time to look at the menu. When he served our food, he kept referencing that \"ladies should always get their meals here.\" I'm alright with it but he kept saying it a lot which end up bugging us.   Our food were huge! Really good price for what we get, but the flavor was okay. We weren't too wowed and it was too much that we had to take it to go. I order the Rock n Roll sushi and it was okay but  I felt it was too much mayonnaise for my liking. When  he asked me if I wanted the sushi boxed and I told him no (I don't bring seafood home because I believe it goes bad the next day). He gave us boxes and our check and asked us why I can't bring the sushi home and what's wrong with it. I already told him the reason but it was frustrating to deal with someone to confront you like that.   I gave this place 3 stars. The food is okay but customer service is the key factor here. It's fine to be nice but not confrontational. I can see myself come back here sometime.",

The main entrees, at least everything we have tried, are delicious AND generous! At PFC my wife and I would order three entrees just to make a meal - and no leftovers. We ordered three entrees the first time here and, oh my, we took a TON home! Now it's two entrees and a manageable amount of leftovers!  The Orange Beef is crispy and tasty. The General Tso's Chicken is our other favorite. We love their Lo Mein but you have to stop ordering at some point!

I hadn't been to Sun Asian Kitchen in a few years, so I was hoping that the food quality and service were still really good. And it was! There was six of us, but the restaurant was pretty empty, so we got our food pretty quickly. What took the most time was getting the little things like our egg rolls, drink refills, chopsticks, and ginger. Our waitress was very nice though and was moving as fast as possible. I love that the lunch menu was until 3pm and then the happy hour menu started at 3pm. I got their ginger broccoli with chicken and a white peach sangria to finish with the happy hour menu. The ginger broccoli with chicken was delicious, but a little heavy on the syrup. The chicken was super tender and their was a nice mix of vegetables. Also, the price was super good as my total was just $11 and I had leftovers. I plan to eat those leftovers in a little bit here. Also, I may go back and get some more food before I leave! I definitely recommend Sun Asian Kitchen for their delicious and light food!",

The last couple times I came, the service was slow, we waited quite awhile for our server to come with just the waters. I will say their boba Thai tea is my favorite drink and I always order it, and that is the one thing that has not let me down. Anyway, so the waitress took awhile to get to us and put in our orders and although the food came out fairly fast, it was cold and old tasting. I ordered the orange chicken and it was more like orange breading, only tiny bits of chicken in the actual dish. The steamed rice was good but the broccoli tasted like it had freezer burn. My son always gets their teriyaki chicken and normally doesn't have a problem finishing it but even he had stated that his food was \"weird\" and didnt finish much of it. Overall, I hope if I ever do come back, i will cross my fingers and hope that the food is better.",

My family and I have stopped in at least 6 times over the last year and have enjoyed their menu.  From their delicious chicken egg-rolls to their sushi, we walk out full and satisfied.  Sun Asian Kitchen is #1",

They don't use the same chicken all Meals which a lot of Chinese places do.   I always reckless staying with the most common orders though. Kung Pau, Orange, Sesame, Honey, broccoli beef, Walnut chicken, you know the usuals-you will never go wrong!  The chicken eggs rolls rock, the lettuce wraps are great, sushi is an 8/10! This is the place we eat at weekly and monthly! You won't be disappointed.   If you like being catered too, then don't expect them to blow you away with service, they get your food to you fast and great, that is all I need! Don't be a smug customer lol.",

    "text": "Decent Chinese food rained upon by poor, awkward service. I've been coming here on occasion over the last three years, but I don't eat-in anymore.  I used to dine in really often because it's close by, but I got tired of all the waiting. Each time I went I ended up waiting too long for my food, my drink, the check, etc. Not only that, the employees don't socialize too well with customers. It's hard to discern if they're rude or just don't grasp how badly they're interacting with people, as though smiling might make their face crack. It's a little creepy.  The last time I was there I was waiting 17 minutes for the bill when I had elsewhere to be, so I decided not to dine in anymore as a result. That and the Egg Foo Yung that they make is pretty much an omelet as opposed to a  patty. It was a doubly disappointing experience that night.  Meanwhile, as a Take-Out restaurant they are pretty good. The food is vastly better at Golden Phoenix, but the physical plant of Sun-Asian is pretty nice itself. Actually, it's gorgeous and it has great outdoor seating as well. Not exactly comfortable seating, but aesthetically pleasing.  The sushi is passable and it feels awkwardly forced on the establishment as though it was a measure taken to compete with the nearby Pan-Asia. Their small portions, high prices and poor quantities ensure I'll have my raw fish elsewhere. It has all the practicality of a cat with a calculator; it doesn't add up.  Heh.  They tend to be good with chicken dishes, but aside from an outstanding physical plant with typically poor service they have little else aside from great eggrolls to offer to   Eat in at your own peril and have nothing else planned for your day because they aren't in a hurry to get you the bill. Be safe, do take-out instead.",

The last time my hubby and I ate here, I got my sushi and a man who sat at the bar after us, ordered the same food after us, got his before my husband.  Just a really blah experience with the cooked food.  They get really really busy during lunch so you may want to come early or avoid the lunch hour.

    "text": "I'm originally from NYC and I've been in Arizona for almost 23 years and still searching for a good Chinese restaurant. I may have found it tonight when we visited Sun Asian Kitchen.  At first glance the outside is in a strip mall, with a pretty patio on the side where you can dine. Walking inside the first thing you see is a bar, and it must have been happy hour because all seats were filled.  We were quickly greeted by a young lady dressed in an Asian top, but her arms were covered with tattoos that were very noticeable and that didn't look very nice (and I am a fan of tats).  Dining room is a little cramped but nice decor, typical Asian style. We asked for a booth and were seated in a small two person booth (I didn't see any larger booths) which was also a bit cramped.  I ordered a cup of wonton soup and we then ordered Roast Pork Egg Foo Young and Orange Chicken. The wonton soup came out very quickly and it was boiling hot, which I really liked since it was a chilly night. The wonton soup was very flavorrful, although quite salty, but it was full of fresh veggies like carrots, bok choy, water chestnuts and scallions. It had three delicious wontons in it and a jumbo shrimp. I have to say that it was some of the best wonton soup I've had since I've been in Arizona and the \"cup\" would have been enough for a meal for me. It was delicious.  Our food came out before I was done with my wonton soup, but it looked and smelled very good and it was very hot and fresh. My fiancee had the Orange Chicken and he enjoyed it so much that he finished the whole dish. I tasted it and it was so good that I might order it next time. It was tender white meat chicken that was deep fried and in a slightly spicy orange glazed sauce with a hint of soy sauce. It wasn't an over powering flavor of orange and the sauce wasn't overwhelming at all. I can't eat spicy foods and this had just the right amount of spice to it.  My Roast Pork Egg Foo Young was again, filled with fresh veggies and sliced twice cooked roast pork which was very tasty. There was so much that I couldn't even finish have the dish. The egg foo young was in a patty underneath the topping of roast pork and veggies and it was really delicious.  Service was prompt and friendly.   This restaurant is a gem and we'll definitely be back!",

However, my new residence is here with my love, so I need to find places where I can get some sake bombers and sushi and not become illegal whilst driving home. I came here, honestly, because of the star rating by my fellow yelpers. Figured the worst that could happen is being poisoned by what one should probably not eat in a desert anyway or I could find good, quality, sushi and have that close to my new home. I love happy hour; cheap drinks and pretty good menu but not any real special rolls on the happy hour menu. That said I find the regular menu to not be badly priced & the staff is sweet end accommodating. I have since ordered take out Chinese and that is good too. I'm impressed because this side if town is lacking in places to really eat that I end up liking enough to return to. However, I am a fan!   PS- they have boba and $1 egg rolls .. Get in it.. Mushi mushi ;-)",

But the waitstaff was lovely and the place is a lot cheerier than you would expect. I only knocked off a star because the booth was a little hard on the rear and the boba balls were a little mushy.

If you have the fake plants please clean the whole plant not just the part you think your customers can see. The table next to us found a, cockroach in their drink. YES, A COCKROACH and then they did not want to refund their dinner, just comp the drink. HORRIBLE    The sushi was good and fresh... but the rolls were loose, which caused the rice to fall off the roll. Who ever is creating the recipes for the rolls needs to be fired. The Teriyaki chicken roll and shogun beef roll needs to be discontinued or redone. There was no visual appeal to the sushi besides it looking fresh, no garnish to add color or different textures to the sushi.  So I will not be visiting SUN ASIAN KITCHEN, NO MORE, YOU LOST ME WITH THE COCKROACH...",

Overall, staff is always friendly and great happy hour when they have sushi.",

The staff is friendly and the furniture sucks. All of the comforts of an SF dive I use to go to on Church St called The Hong Kong. It closed up a while back. Mr. Chen moved back to China.",
