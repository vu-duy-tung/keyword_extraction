The service was good as well.  Waiter was attentive without bothering us too much.  I ordered a dinner salad which was great.  My b/f had the salmon which he enjoyed also.  While I would probably not make a special trip to go here, I would stop in again if I was already at the mall.",

I am not a big sushi fan, but the menu had many entrees that was not seafood or sushi. We ordered the avocado egg roll as a starter, and I was in heaven. It doesn't get much better than avocado in a fried egg roll with whatever that delicious green honey sauce was. YUM. I then ordered the grilled vegetable flatbread which had grilled asparagus, yellow squash, roasted red pepper, pesto, mozzarella, and balsamic vinegar. It was placed in front of me and I was sold. It tasted exactly how my imagination tasted it. I ate half of it and was stuffed, which was awesome since I got to eat the other half for dinner. From my one experience and one meal I give it 5 stars. I don't think I would try anything else there since I don't think it could get better than what I had ordered.",

It's in the mall which is convenient for shoppers, but the times I've gone the service was slow, I don't like the look of it, and it smells really bad inside. The menu is nothing special, just a mix of all sorts of different things. It's unoriginal. They have a sushi bar, and I have had the Rainbow Roll there which was okay, but I wouldn't recommend this to anyone at all.",

All in all a very popular and tasty place to dine or just chill after a hard day's work.",

The flavor of the dishes were average with nothing standing out.  Typical mall restaurant, average food for above average prices. I dont know why I was expecting anything different.",

We ordered the chicken skewers, crab crunch roll, crab special roll, and the bama... Hey what you can say I was hungry. The rolls were ok except for the crab special roll. It was so salty. I mean I was like is it just me or is the super salty? Kira tried a piece as well and she was like wow, yea that is a little over salty. I asked our fabulous waiter about it and he kindly said would you like to order a california roll instead and I will take the crab roll off? Really? wow thank you. So i pushed that other roll to the side and devoured the rest (hey I told you I was hungry) and enjoyed great convo and food with Kira. Everyone was really nice, and the food, with the exception of the salty crab special roll was yummy. I will definitely be back again soon.",

I am always happy with my experience at Kona, and find myself comparing it to other sushi restaurants. None can compare to Kona. Kona is the only place that offers my cherished Skinny Cucumber Mojito, and I come here often for it. I ask for this drink at other places and am always shocked that most don't even offer a skinny option, let alone the cucumber mojito. I have dined in the Scottsdale location as well as the Cherry Creek location in Denver, and both have equivalent high marks in service and food quality.",

    "text": "Oh Kona Grill, how you bring back memories.    I first discovered Kona Grill's happy hour back in college, the lure of the $2.50 Ladies Margarita and the half price happy hour menu fit right in to my college budget!  Although the shopping after too many $2.50 Ladies Margarita's didn't, but that's a story for another day.  I went to Happy Hour at Kona yesterday for the first time in awhile, and oddly enough, it was with some of my old college buddies.  We were excited for cheap food and drinks, because even though we aren't in college anymore, we still love cheap eats!  It was a bit cold and rainy yesterday, so we were able to easily find a table on the patio (HH is only available on the patio and bar....so getting a seat sometimes turns into a stakeout!). We were a bit disappointed to see that the HH menu was a bit different than before; instead of just all the sushi and apps and pizzas being half price, they were bunched into groups by price.  Some of the prices were still half off, but others, like the Edamame ($4.00 regularly and $3.00 during HH) were not that great of a deal.  Being that it we were quite hungry, we ordered some sushi, edamame, calamari, chicken tacos, avocado egg rolls and the potstickers.  All of the food was much like we remembered, with the calamari being our overwhelming favorite, so crispy with the spicy sauce, yum!  We were a bit disappointed to see that the tacos no longer came with the yummy fried rice like they used to, but it wasn't the end of the world.  The sushi was good, but not the best I have ever had, but fresh nonetheless.  The biggest bummer about the sushi was that most of the rolls that we wanted weren't on the HH menu, especially since they were only $6.00 to begin with the HH sushi rolls were all $3.00....didn't make sense to us.  I know I will go back to Kona, but only during happy hour, I don't love it enough to pay full price!",

Not to mention how much they charged, their services were really hollow.  So, I ordered a cheeseburger and I was so surprised that they couldn't even make it right.  I mean it is supposed to a simple meal.  I mean if you cannot handle the fundamentals, how can you handle special dishes.  So, going back to my so called cheeseburger.  For one thing, I couldn't taste any \"cheese\" out of the cheeseburger.  For another, the patty is just bland.  Also, they also seemed to run out of onion.  I was very  disappointed.  My hubby, too, found it strange that they could make his chicken sandwich so dry.  The pineapple and chicken were like 1000 years old and the bread was cold.  Sometimes, I just wonder how these guys can survive. If I were them, I would be extremely worried especially we are now in an economic downturn.",

So I felt bad ordering a 30 dolla item on a first date even though he said I could have a steak if I wanted to and I sure did really want to try a steak there but I settled for the cheaper steak sandwich...I def want to go back for Sushi happy hour but I think I recall you have to be sitting on the patio for that. My sandwich was awesome and my date had pad thai which was horrible. It tasted like soy sauce with tons of garlic in it, very odd recipe but he liked it since he never had Thai before so he thought that was the normal taste...however myself being the Thai conossier was pretty shocked. They sat us in the last booth right by the hallway to the bathroom, I wasnt sure whether to say we'll just wait for another table but honestly, they should have comped us a salad or some drinks because what is more ridiculous than that espec if you are on a first date. My date loved the giant fish tank but thats so common for restaurants, it didnt really phase me but I think if you were sitting there by the sushi bar, it would be nice, there is a big rockfish in it or fan fish or whatever it might be called..I think the hostess and the manager guy with the tie is very pleasant. But there was a huge line at the mexican place across ways so I think this place prices are too high...my sandwich was 14 bucks which I could have got a good steak elsewhere for that. The french fries were quiet good that came with it. I was kind of bummed out as well that the waitress boxed my half steak sandwich but she left out those fabulous fries? Next time I have to remember to tell these people, put all of it in the box.",

Blew me away that is a $13 roll? They were all like this.   Only one other sushi place I been to that gave such little fish in their rolls.   Just hard to recommend when the sushi is so ridiculously small and overpriced.   My wife's turkey and Brie was very good. Although I personally think it would be better as a hot sandwich but that is preference and she knew it was a cold sandwich when she ordered it so no mark down for that.

The mall, as usual, is hell to park at. I definitely recommend not wasting your time in the upper lots. Go park underneath... you'll thank me when your car isn't 130 degrees after your meal. The place itself is designed to be kind of cool and modern... it had a nice vibe when we walked in, but beware that if you sit outside, you'll have a lot of road noise.  The Service: Here's where you're losing a star, Kona. Our waitress was disinterested, annoyed and came off very rude to both my coworker and I. Truly, the most accurate word in that description was \"annoyed\" - the entire time. I asked a question regarding the components of a salad, and there was an implied, but unstated \"you moron...\" at the end of her response. Like, that's the only way I can explain this girl's attitude. Totally unpleasant. And especially after we'd ordered, she was very slow, taking about 10 minutes after we'd had our plates taken to bring us our checks. (For what it's worth, I've been a waitress too. I'm not just giving this girl a hard time for no reason. She had an attitude going on and made it quite plain she didn't care to be there.)  More on the ambiance: While we waited for our checks, a lady was seated directly next to us, smoking like a chimney and blowing her smoke out at eye level, straight at our table, which was both rude and annoying. There was a lot of seating available, including several tables with no one next to them. I recognize that that's the hazard of eating on the patio, but this was pretty disgusting.... Though I acknowledge that not much may be done there. Just something to be aware of if you sit outside.  The Meal: The food was much better than I was expecting, and I really enjoyed my salad. The shrimp was great, and the dressing wasn't too heavy. My coworker had a few sushi rolls that she enjoyed, and we were satisfied with the quality. The gentleman who brought out my food was much more courteous.  The value: Another lost star. My meal, which was water and a salad, came out to around $19 with tip. For a salad, that's ridiculous!! I'll definitely head around the corner to Chop Shop for a better meal at a cheaper price with much kinder service next time.",

We waited. Several people came and cleaned and setup other tables. We waited some more. They sat another group in the same area. We both waited.

We entered through the mall entrance and proceeded to head upstairs to the bar area outside so we could just seat ourselves and enjoy the beautiful weather.  To our delight we found out Happy Hour is all day Sunday. Wahhh-hooooo!!  So in addition to my Avocado Egg Rolls I was also able to try the Chicken Potsticker and they were amazing. First off, thank you for having chicken, too many places have pork and I just don't do pork. I wasn't expecting them to be so crispy, but they were fantastic.   I couldn't tell you what the other ladies had because I was enjoying every last bite of my late lunch to pay attention.   Knowing there's Happy Hour all day Sunday will likely cause me to rearrange my schedule so I can get two appetizers for the price of one!",

    "text": "I've always been a Kona fan. So when my friend decided on this place for the dinner before her bachelorette party, I knew exactly what to expect.  We had made a reservation, so they were prepared to accommodate our large group. What they weren't prepared for was how their other customers would feel. They decided to place us next to the railing inside the mall, and while the majority of our group tried to stick to general restaurant etiquette, some of us failed. Those of us that were did a LOT of apologizing to the tables around us. I feel like Kona should have placed us in a more private location, being that we forewarned them that we were a bach party.  Our waiter didn't help the situation either. While he did cater to our ladies shots requests, encouraging things like sake bombs, he was also very sarcastic and rude when it came to everything else. He made a lot of off color jokes and comments about our get ups that weren't \"ha ha\", but more of \"you're all morons\". Here's a tip buddy: don't talk down to your customers. Especially ones that are likely going to be your biggest tip of the night. Our less than appropriate waiter had a younger female waitress helping him w/ orders and food delivery. She was awesome. She did her best to make sure everyone tabs were correct and fixed a few order issues that her counterpart had no interest in remedying. Such as asking the bartender for ginger beer for our one lady who foregoes booze. He scoffed at her and went to the next person to order. While our female savor went straight to the bar and brought back the ginger beer w/ an apology and promise that none of her \"beers' would appear on our check.  The food was really good (this is what I knew to expect). Most of the ladies went between pizzas and sushi, both were enjoyed. Their updated drink menu was very good. We very much enjoyed that you could actually see what the drinks looked like on the iPads that served as drink menus. Some table faves included: raspberry crush, strawberry basil lemonade, pineapple honey mojito, and the strawberry fizz.  All in all, our experience was good, mainly due to the menu and our female waitress (I WISH I could remember her name). I know the bride will definitely be coming here again. As for me, if I'm in the area I might visit the bar.",

Kona has a \"happy hour\" lunch, where select sushi rolls and other dishes are half-price!    Kona is at Scottsdale Fashion Square in Scottsdale, across from Starbucks and The Yard House. On the weekends I prefer to mosey up to the half-in, half-out bar upstairs on the patio and enjoy lunch. The dining room downstairs is nice also. The service has been great nearly every time I've been. So far my fave rolls are the Vegas, Bama, Voodoo, Crab Special, and the good ol' standbys, California and Philly.   If you're going on Saturdays and plan to sit at the bar or on the patio, I suggest arriving before noon -- very crowded after that.",

    "text": "Bar and grill places at the mall do not excite me.  They tend to remind me of a TGI Friday's, no matter how modern and fun they are.  Kona Grill, despite being a chain bar and grill at the mall, was a pleasant surprise.  We were looking for a place to watch a World Baseball Classic game, and all bars in Old Town Scottsdale were overflowing with thirsty baseball fans.  Fortunately, one of the locals suggested Kona Grill.  We parked our rental car in one of the covered garages and went in.  The restaurant looked nice and modern without being pretentious.  We decided to sit on the patio, despite the lax smoking laws in Arizona.  The weather was perfect, and the covered concrete patio with wrought iron chairs and tables seemed like the place to be.  We patiently waited until the Arizona State basketball game was over, and patrons started leaving for greener pastures.  We grabbed a huge round table in front of the biggest TV on the patio and sat down.  That's pretty much how we spent the next 3 hours.  We ordered just about everything on the menu: mini sliders, onion strings, taco, pasta and a huge plate of sushi.  Kona claims that its menu is where East meets West.  In reality, it means that you are getting Western food with an Eastern flavor.  You don't come here for authentic Asian food; you come here to watch a game with friends and/or have a drink or two.  A word about the staff here.  They could not have been friendlier, nicer or more accommodating.  The manager showed up with the remote to turn on the game that we wanted.  A waiter literally walked me to the bathroom instead of pointing me in the general direction.  Our waitress was chatty, funny and super helpful.  She talked me out of getting the Thai-Peanut chicken noodles: \"Are you sure you know what it is?  I wouldn't order it, unless you really like salty peanut butter.  'Cause that's what it tastes like.\"  I ordered the Pad Thai instead, and it was pretty decent.  The string onions were pretty good, and the sliders were just average.  We even had a celebrity sighting at the table right behind us.  A San Francisco Giants outfielder, let's call him, ummm, Baron Crowand, was enjoying a light dinner at Kona.  He was not, however, enjoying the company of his three female friends.  In fact, at one point during dinner, we thought he had ditched the women and bolted for the door.  That wasn't the case though.  Hey, if this place is good enough for a major league baseball player, it's good enough for me.  Above average food + fun and relaxing atmosphere + friendly service = I will be back!",

Choices in spades; what type of trim, color, upholstery selection, sport kit, body flash, electronics levels, stereo package A. B. or C.          A Honda Accord.  This is the type of car a middle-class suburbanite who lives in a plan cloned house with 2 kids and a dog, or cat, if your into that, would buy.  He likes it for the value it provides, the build quality, and the brownness of it all.  Mr. super suburbanite likes the overall package, not too hot, not too cold.  He wants good food, better service, and a comfortable atmosphere.    Kona Grill is not for this person.  Let me tell you who would like Kona Grill.          The gentleman in the kitted Neon box, with 3000 watts of stereo, flash rims, and orange paint.  He would love this place!  All the flash and boom, and none of the quality.  Rubbish gearbox, bad engine, woeful 18th century suspension, the lot.  But at least it makes a lot of noise, and its orange.        Kona Grill is supposed to have a quality Happy Hour.  I have not tried the Happy Hour, but whatever.  The Thai peanut noodles where completely awful.  The next time I want linguine with peanut butter I'll make it myself.  The breaded onion rings, presented tower-like, delivered wave-after-wave of blandness.  I've had more convincing  water.  For a place masquerading in a Kona mask I expected more things from Hawaii on the menu, or at least an attempt with something other than pineapple, which by the way is from South America.  Kona Grill is pretty much like a Scottsdale themed Applebees.        That said, just go there to get pissed and chat up the birds on a hen night.  An A on that front.  I hear the salads are good, so I'll go back to try that and the Happy Hour.  3 Stars because what limited experience I had was woeful, but I'll go back because a bit of flash and kit is every man's secret desire.  Cheers Until then, get the beers in....",

I was only 18 and the rest of my \"crew\" were of age. I had never had sushi before so this place was a little intimitating at first, but once i started to try it, i enjoyed it very much so. (Now that i'm more of a sushi expert, i can say their sushi wasn't great, but good for beginners.) I can still say (at least 3 years ago) that they have the best calamari i've ever had. This place, at the time, had a great atmosphere and saki bombs were okay to do here...   It may have just been the company i was with, but i greatly enjoyed coming to this place and sneaking saki bombs and shots :)  next time i go back to AZ to visit, this place is a must",

This is a definitely a must try! And I will definitely come back here again during my next visit...",

    "text": "I wasn't sure what to expect after reading the reviews here....while I wouldn't say it's in the basement I do get the whole car fumes thing.  However, we were sitting fairly far back and didn't have any issues with it.  The happy hour offerings are just ok as far as drinks go.  It's a rather limited drink selection, and not really containing anything I drink.  I went with a cosmo which was surprisingly (and thankfully) not too sweet.   My husband was happy to see Sam on a menu, even if they charged him $4.50 for it instead of $4.00  The food sounds interesting but is fairly standard flavor wise.  The chicken macadamia nut tacos didn't really have a mac nut taste to them.  The onion rings were gigantic  (seriously) and were fairly tasteless.  The calamari was decent, but very spicy, and the satay was average.  Perhaps we should have gone with sushi, but being in a place named the Kona Grill I was hoping to get some Hawaiian flavors in there.    The great thing about their happy hour is not just that it's in the mall, but that they do it twice a day.  In theory you could sit there all afternoon drinking, at 7 go into the mall and shop, and come back at 10 to drink some more.",

I hardly even know this girl except for the horror stories that i have heard.  Whats even worse is the the \"manager\" actually did it.  Cant comment on the food considering we got kicked out before it came to the table.  Yikes!  hopefully there isnt any imaginary restraining orders on future guests that go in there.",

They have drinks for under $5 and sushi rolls for under $6! They have a few other things on the menu like their potstickers, etc... and the food is really yummy! The highlight of the night was enjoying drinks and food for under $15. This is only available in the bar area but I highly suggest everyone check this out.",

Is it the choice view of the parking garage entrance?  The gentle breeze laden with the scent of car exhaust ?  I swear, it's True.  Flocks of shiny happy people packed like sardines onto the postage stamp sized patio.  Maybe it's the proximity to the valet station, patio viewers can quickly size up the, errrr, \"qualifications\" of would be suitors?  I just don't know.  On a more serious note, the food is pretty good.  The drinks are pretty good.  The restaurant itself is modern and stylish.

I can't comment on the indoor atmosphere or anything as I was unable to get past the peacefulness of the outdoor patio I came across first.   It wasn't very busy and the service was fantastic. We were promptly greeted by our server who didn't seem to mind that it took us 35 minutes or so to even decide on a drink let alone our meal and dessert. He patiently came back and checked on us every so often when he saw we were having a break in our conversation. I was appreciative he didn't constantly stalk us every 2 minutes.   The food was absolutely delicious and came out with perfect timing for each course. We started off with the sweet and spicy shrimp appetizer which was delicious and the perfect size for two of us. Just as we were about finished, our sushi came out. I ordered the las vegas roll, which really hit the spot that day. Just the right amount of food. Lastly, we decided to share the carmelized apple crisp. Mmmmmm. Delicious. We were only able to eat a little more than half of it, which makes me think the individual one might actually work for two people. I'm picky when it comes to baked apples, and this was truly decadent. I also had the pina cojito while I was there which was just a gorgeous work of art in a glass and had the freshest pineapple along with it. I'm glad I don't know how to make those.   In the end, although it's a chain, this is a place i'd come back to. I've yet to try the Macadamia Nut Chicken.",

Let me start off by saying I tried to totally different wines that tasted exactly the same -- sour and rotten. Then we wanted an appetizer. SO I got California Rolls. Now, I know that's kind of lame, for people who are into sushi. I'm not into sushi. Our waitress actually ROLLED HER EYES when I ordered it. Kona Grill, come off it! You're like the Olive Garden of Sushi, and you're judging ME for ordering California rolls??? Then they weren't even very good. And my stomach was upset for about four hours after I ate it. And our waitress took about 30 minutes to bring us our check. And our table was sticky and smelled of beer. Ick.  Never coming back.",

    "text": "Shopping through fashion square on the 17th, my boyfriend eagerly suggested we eat here and after our experience he couldn't even understand what he was so thrilled about.   First off the hostess was impersonal and seemed to be not only more preoccupied with the boys working there, but slightly bitchy. I may retract the bitchy statement seeing as how I live in Phoenix and this may just be a Scottsdale thing.  Once seated our Server Chris was prompt in getting our drink order and our dinner order- this may have just been the only thing he did correctly. I ordered a Phili Roll with a side of rice and my boyfriend ordered soup and some Chicken and mash potato meal. Here's where it went from slightly unsettling to what the hell am I doing here.  My Phili Roll came out about two minutes after ordering it.. I work in a place that serves Sushi and there is no way you can get it that quickly in a fairly busy place. I was weirded out and slightly afraid to eat what I would assume was a roll that had been ordered by mistake. My boyfriend then received his soup seconds later- now mind you, because I work in a restaurant, I'm a fully aware that our server has two tables- INCLUDING US. He didn't bring out our food, food runners did. My boyfriends soup was splattered around the edges and not the best he's had. About two bites in he received his chicken meal. All of this has been delivered about five minutes after ordering. If I wanted fast food I would have gone to a fast food joint. His chicken meal was mediocre as I had tried a few bites and my sushi was by far the worst I've ever had. Oh and by the way are you wondering where my side of rice is? Yeah, I was too! Through this our server didn't check on us, didn't bring out our food and his manager had to refill our drinks. Oh, but all of this should be okay since it looked as though Chris was in a deep conversation with the large group of servers standing near the stairs, and boy was he thirsty because he completely forgot his manners and drank down multiple drinks throughout his conversation. I made eye contact with him multiple times trying to get him to do his job- and every time he just turned his head back to the conversation.   Once finished eating it was a different manager who boxed up the remainder of my boyfriends food. The server came over about 15 minutes after we were done to help the busser clean the table and bring us our check.  Oh no Chris, thank you very much for asking, but we didn't want more to drink, nor did we want dessert. Not only did he hardly speak to us, not offer us dessert, not check on us, not refill our drinks, not bring our food, or our check in a timely matter but he took our drinks away and completely rushed us out of the place. At this point it was time to get a manager involved in our horrid experience. Being the manager of a restaurant himself, my boyfriend explained all the wrong doings of our experience.  And boy did I have to hold back a chuckle when the manager responded with a, \"well that's weird.\" REALLY? He kindly took 10 dollars off of our 50 dollar crap meal and told us to enjoy the rest of our night.   Ten bucks off the worst meal, worst service and worst experience of my dining life? You're kidding right? And to top it off the guy could have cared less. Cute, really cute. At least we also knew tipping was out of the question at this point. I have been wonderfully trained in giving good service at the restaurant I am currently employed at. This goes for my boyfriend as well. Our management and training teams have given us a good eye for great service, and in turn this goes for terrible service as well. So, maybe that makes us individually spoiled in some way? Ehh, no, the experience was downright screwy.  Oh and don't let me forget the hellish diarrhea we both experienced once home.  But hey, at least we were able to get some delicious caramel apples from the beautifully serviced rocky mountain chocolate factory. You couldn't pay me to come back to this place and trust me the majority of the people we have told about our experience won't be dining there either.",

The servers are super sweet especially McKenna, Stephanie, Eric and Josh! I'm biased but they are amazing! If you go upstairs (3-7) week days and different hours on weekends, that's where happy hour is served. If you sit at the bar Brett and Russ will keep you company. I recommend almost everything there. Appetizers are great like the avocado egg roll or chicken satay (sub out the slaw) for pineapple pork rice.. Hm the cosmos are sweet.. I could ramble on. If you feel like a sandwich I enjoy the avocado chicken club. If you want a salad you must order the oriental chicken salad!! It's delish!! Lastly, if you are there for dinner the sea bass is fishy but it's a favorite of mine or pork tenderloin. Haha I know this whole menu but overall if you are a first timer at Kona, you will have lots of options. The menu is half sushi and half American based food with a style of Caribbean. I love Kona obviously! :)",

I go to this location most often because I live near by and I would highly recommend it and always always take friends here for dinner.    My top go to happy hour food items: Avocado Eggs rolls, Chicken Satay, Crab crunch roll  My other favorites are: any of the flat breads, calamari, sometimes even the sliders and honestly any of the sushi rolls.

Our Waitress was pretty solid, but the bussers failed her in failing to bring the Sriracha that I had requested when asked if I needed anything else and then not refilling our water.  She did hook us up with waters to go though.  Maybe it was a bad night for them, idk.  Not really worth my time when I like Thirsty Lion's menu a lot better.  The Brooccoli Stir was delicious, and I'm never allowing my girlfriend to choose sushi again, because the baked salmon was brutal.",

We got no sushi at a sushi restaurant.  Our fish was just ok so I am not sure if the rest of the chefs left too but it was pretty weak. Bought a $100 bottle of wine and a couple of entrees and  they removed the sushi from our bill since they couldn't provide it but offered no other discounts and no real explanation. Felt weird. Restaurant was also very cold. Never took our coats off. Sad cause I used to really like this place.",

While i often find restaurant staff either unwilling to accommodate me, or doing so with a bad attitude, Kona has impressed.  Sophie is MY server, and she is always fantastic. She is on top of my dairy allergy, and is very clearly concerned. Sophie always makes sure that i am happy, and has immediately rectified anything I have seen as an issue. Always ask for SOPHIE!  The reason I came here originally it was just to get a happy hour drink. Now that I know that they'll accommodate my dairy allergy I will continue to patronize Kona Grill, for drinks and food, aa long as Sophie continues to serve me. This is an excellent restaurant, and i only have great things to say.",

Perhaps you even dropped a thousand bucks at Neiman's on a worthless Jhane Barnes' sweater and some silk-lined Zanella slacks or three thousand on a whats-left-of-last-season's-collection of Brioni blazer. Whatever your fancy, you're toting a wrist full of roped, glossy, shooshing-sounding bags with tissue paper sticking out the tops. You just want a break and some cool refreshing sushi.  It's OK, but beware. Unagi and other \"hot\" items have a \"beep-beep beep-beep\" before they get to you. California and spicy tuna rolls come real quick -- 'cause they come from a vat of mayonnaise. Rice is not right either. Stick to tuna and salmon sashimi and miso soup.  If head chef Rick is there (think Kyoto of Empire at 24th and Camelback, then Ichi Ban, University off McClintock), ask him to make you a Fat Bob on Acid, for good ol' times' sake. Or just go to Starbucks, tide yourself over, and find a real sushi restaurant.  And about the Brioni... Don't sweat the buyer's remorse. It'll make a great tax deduction to Florence's.",

I was very impressed to see that the kitchen staff used gloves while cooking the food. There was a beautiful aquarium near the sushi bar. I don't think that there is a breakroom for the staff, however, because those that were on break were milling about near the kitchen talking and joking around. It really ruined the atmosphere of our dinner.  The food was tasty however the sushi was bland. I've had much better at actual sushi restaurants.

    "text": "Kona grill is a nice restaurant if you are forced for some unknown reason to eat in the mall.  I have eaten there a couple of times but we mainly dine on the patio getting a couple of drinks and appetizers.  We went over the weekend during one of the NCAA games and it was very lively.  It was packed but we managed to get a seat outside on the patio.   As far as the service since it was so crowded I felt the waitress was very rushed but never the less she tried to be as attentive as she could.   Atmosphere: good for groups or parties.  I don't know if it was just because of the game but there were lots of intoxicated people around us (it was also only 6 pm). And plenty of saki bombs at nearby tables.   This time we just got the sushi which I would describe as below average.  The presentation was less then appealing and several rolls were oddly shaped or stuffed to the brim.  The portion was also small ( I think it came with 6 pieces) for the the price.  I first got the white saki sangria. It was \"fine\" nothing great but I still drank it. I asked the server for a second drink recommendation but she didn't have one. ( I know people probably hate that but I don't drink often so Im never sure!)  I choose the strawberry fizz for my second drink hoping it would be similar to other drinks I have loved in the past (i.e. Culinary Drop Outs drink Room service.)  No such luck, but it wasn't horrible either.   I think that is the overall experience of Kona grill: fine.  Nothing was bad but nothing stands out.  With several other options in the area if I were planning a dinner out It would not be one of my choices.  But if you are at the mall and the line is too long for Yard House you don't have too many other options.",

Kona Grill is a chain which makes me want to give them only 3 stars, but considering their food is quality, they offer a fun atmosphere, and their service is decent... I'm giving 4 stars instead.  As many of the reviews before mine say, happy hour at Kona is great.  From 3 - 7, they offer 1/2 off a small menu of appetizers, sushi rolls, pizzas, and drinks.  (They also have a reverse happy hour from 10pm on I think).  I can't speak for the pizzas (I've never tried them), but the potsticker appetizer is great, and so is the sushi.  If I'm not concerned about happy hour prices, I've often ordered other menu items such as seaweed salad, edamame, nigiri, and the seabass entree too.  I've never been disappointed.  I usually do not choose Kona as a destination, but if I'm in the area, at the mall, or someone else chooses it, I'm happy going to Kona every now and then.

The dish came with a decent sized fillet of grilled sea bass, grilled broccolini spears and some (surprisingly) tasty fried rice.  The food went well with my glass of pinot grigio ($7), and although the fish wasn't as fresh as I thought it could be, I was still satisfied with the order.    My friend ordered the sweet-chili glazed salmon ($18.95), which came with a generously sized grilled salmon piece, grilled broccolini spears, fried rice, and green onion curls.  I took a bite of her salmon and found it to be tasty; there was a little kick because of the chili glaze.  (See photos)",

Service was actually very good on Mother's Day, a day which could try even the best server's patience with large tables filled with children, parents and grandparents.  (There were quite a few of these.) - 4 stars    I love their salmon wasabi sashimi  topped with fresh wasabi root. It is one of my favorite sushi style dishes in the Valley -- 5 stars   My husband had two different rolls, the crab crunch and the soft shall crab.  I told him he would be disappointed compared to the rolls we normally have at our local Japanese restaurant in North Scottsdale, Toyama, but he insisted.  He was definitely bummed - 1 star  We also ordered the grilled veggie flatbread.  That was divine . . . so much so , I went back with my girlfriend today to have it again.  The flatbread is huge, about 6 x 14 inches and it was loaded with grilled mushrooms, zucchini, asparagus, pesto, mozzarella and balsamic vinegar. It's enough for two for lunch, or as a starter to share with the table. - 5 stars  Definitely a great place to go for sit-down in Scottsdale Fashion Square, but stay away from the rolls and stick with the main menu, except give the salmon wasabi sashimi a try. It is the only for sure on the sushi side!",

The wait staff is SSSLLLLOOOWWW, thus the 4/5 rating.  My Faves? The Atlantic Roll - delicious and ONLY $3! The other sushi rolls are all pretty mediocre.  The Avocado Egg Rolls - MMMM-azing and their dipping sauce even more so. I would be willing to add this to my list of \"Last Meals on Earth\".  Hawaiian Pizza - The best of the pizza options.   The only thing I've had from the HH menu that I didn't thoroughly enjoy was the Chicken Satay.   I go here about every other week with friends. Happy hour runs from 3-7.  Come enjoy a late lunch or early dinner. My total bill typically comes to around $8. Can't beat that!",

When they had two full booths in the front room and a all most full open room in the rear half. Sarcasm was strong with this women. Haha.  Now, after being seated in a booth. We were introduced to a lovely waitress who, for the whole meal, made the lunch return back to my past amazing outing at this restaurant. Our food was on point, out fresh and fast with out sacrificing a sliver of excellence. Great environment, supreme chefs, pristine dining.

    "text": "After doing some shopping we were craving sushi and decided to come here. Big mistake. We overheard a server telling someone that they weren't serving sushi that night, that the sushi chefs had all walked out and quit! Then the rumors started. The servers were whispering amongst themselves and saying some pretty negative things about working there. We ordered a kids meal for our son the second we sat down, and a appetizer and two entrees 15 minutes later. The appetizer came out, and was delivered to the table next to us. The table said \"we didn't order this\" and the appetizer was taken back to the kitchen. 10 minutes passed and then it was brought to our table but had obviously been sitting under a heat lamp because the plate was super hot. When the appetizer was finally delivered, we inquired about our sons kids meal and the waitress seemed flustered and ran back to get it. I ordered my steak medium rare, it arrived in two pieces- one so well done it was charred and the other so rare I couldn't eat it. Rather than ask for the check, my husband found our waitress and gave her his credit card and asked for a to go box, we figured we'd take the nasty steak home and maybe our dogs would eat it. After a ridiculously long wait our check was brought, but no to go box. Instead, she showed up 10 minutes later with two new waters. She put them down and we said we didn't need anymore water, just a freaking to go box. She said oh yeah! Then gave us a super small to go box. We boxed up the over and under cooked steak and got the F out of there.  Oh and during all this the sushi chefs returned and tried to start working. A manager came up, told them not to touch anything and that someone (guessing the GM) was driving in to talk to them. The manager seemed quite rude to the chefs and most of the wait staff. No wonder the sushi chefs walked out!",

First of all it is cold out and they insist on having the patio door open. My hot food did not stay hot long with wind blowing through there. We asked a manager to close the door and she obliged. However I guess the waitstaff did not like that as they opened it right back up. The manager came back closed it again and we had a brief respite from the frigid breeze blowing through the bar area. The wait staff appear to not care that you have tables huddled together for warmth and or moving to escape the wind. All in all the only reason I am giving 2 stars is 1. Food was good and 2. The tiny manager that tried to save us from hypothermia.",

A mixture of Asian fusion/American, it is a place to see and be seen with a beautiful environment and people. This location plus the Kierland Commons, Gilbert Mall, Peoria and the Chandler mall and elsewhere have been around for over a decade because they are good.  Their salt water fish tanks are beautiful, and must be difficult to maintain since I have witnessed turnover of some of the most incredible and gigantic fish. The happy hour is great after hours and on Sunday since they offer everything from alcohol and handmade flat and unique large rectangular pizzas to appetizers and sushi for a great deal.  All their dishes have great taste and presentation. Their birthday club is also super generous",

    "text": "My wife an I had lunch today at the Kona Grill in Fashion Square.  First, if you are a sushi snob, this probably isn't the place for you.  It's just not a 'fine food' restaurant.  Rather it's a chain on the same level as P.F. Chang's or Cheesecake Factory.  You know all of the food will be edible and on the tasty side but nothing particularly special.    The restaurant itself is quite pleasant and the sushi bar is pretty cool.  Service was solid. Water and drinks refilled without needing to ask and our waitress was really nice.  Unfortunately, the food wasn't at the level of the surroundings or the service.  We ordered the Voodoo Roll and the  Picasso role.  Both were OK but I thought they sacrificed flavor for heat (and I love really hot foods).  My wife disagreed and liked both rolls.  I also ordered the spicy shrimp tempura. My advice...just don't.  It was basically battered shrimp with a completely boring hot sauce.  Rather than being light and airy like good tempura, this was just crunchy and a bit greasy.    My wife is an eel lover.  She said that on a 1-5 scale, the eel was a 2.  She thought it was rubbery and, in her words, just not right.  The salmon sushi was just OK and she said the sushi rice was not particularly good.  In addition, although the rolls were nicely plated, they didn't hold together well.   This would have merited thee stars but for the price.  Over $70 for two mediocre rolls and some fried shrimp (yeah, some salmon and eel sushi too but only one order of eel and two orders of salmon) and no drinks is over the top. I can list a half dozen Japanese restaurants in the Valley with far better food and either better or similar prices.",

It was random but you'd get overly salty bites.  Shrimp pad Thai was terrible.  So sweet and shrimp weren't good quality.  One person at our table got a chicken club sandwich which was very good.  But a restaurant that focuses on seafood should have good seafood.  Would have been happier with almost anything in the food court.",

Right? * nope!! Waited twenty minutes for first round of drinks. Waited 35 more minutes for meal. Appitizer (Deviled eggs... Delicious) came with entre (pad tai noodles... Gross. Dry, bland), ordered second round of drinks, server disappeared (saw her sweeping and chatting with coworkers). Finally called manager over, he was giving vibe of really not caring while offering apologies.  Offered to give app free, but I didn't want free food.. I wanted him to know his staff really weren't up to snuff.  Meh, he walked away, we quickly finished. Won't be back. Pity. * group apps were good, (sushi samplers and sushi trays)...

There are no napkins or silverware on the table so I guess you have to ask for it.  When we asked for napkins and silverware our waitress said \"oh did you need those?\" It's a damn restaurant, of course we need napkins and silverware. We asked to speak to the manager and he was mildly apologetic and did take money off our bill eventually, but we will NEVER be back. Kona Grill can close up for all we care, they obviously don't care about their customers and depend on tourist mall traffic for customers. Maybe they should take all the negative reviews to heart and clean house on their indifferent, lazy staff.",

We noticed the servers standing around talking and texting. The food came before we even were given napkins and chopsticks. It took us forever just to get a refill of water. We looked around and our waiter was just hanging out with the other waiters talking. They all seemed to know a few girls at the bar so the staff paid more attention to those girls than the customers in the lounge. One of the girls said hello to another staff member who looked like a manager and grabbed his butt. The man did not stop her. It just seemed really inappropriate. I understand talking and playing around with people you know but when it is affecting your work then you need to buckle down. They make you feel like you're wasting their time.

    "text": "KG is the spot to be seen and heard! The usual Fridays it seems, I would roll up down Camelback Rd from the 51 after work hours, 5PM-ish.  Now, if you are lucky enough, you and your peeps you were suppose to meet up with will find an open spot.  Nine out of ten times, we are not so lucky as it seems, always!   Yes, a temporary glitch to a good time after a long work week! So, the quick solution is to just grab some booze from the bar, the usual Heineken, and wait for the next open table and hope that the party occupying your table-to-be leaves before HH ends!   My cuatro stars is based solely on my HH delights and experience.  The sushi and drinks offered here during HH is nothing stellar, but has an appealing price tag that runs you $3-5 a pop.  The menu indeed is limited to some of your basic sushi rolls such as the California and shrimp tempura.  Another favorite is the calamaris.  The quality is average at best while still satisfying both our wallets and taste bud.  In my typical setting of anywhere from six to a dozen peeps, we typically like to down our apps with Sake and Japanese Beer such Sapporo or Kieren.  Wait, isn't that a recipe for a Sake Bomber? Yes, yes it is!   If you don't mind the noisy chatter from every which direction meaning the table next to you or the traffic coming in and out of Fashion Square,  bumping music in this hostile social environment on an early Friday evening, possibly a slight chance of waiting for an opened seating, and a very attractive on-a-low-budget Happy Hour menu, I highly recommend this I am too cool-for-you Old Town scene.",

    "text": "First, let me say that this review is ONLY for Happy Hour from 3pm to 7pm. Second, let me tell you that I've been going here for years.  The happy hour drink specials are nothing special (get it?)  The margaritas vary in alcohol content depending on some cosmic sign from the universe. Apparently, when the moon is in retrograde, they are eyewateringly strong.  However, when Gemini is on the cusp (or something) then they taste like they have nothing in them.  On the other hand, the saki bombers are a pretty good deal.  So, you ask, why give it 4 stars and keep going?  The food!  The Happy Hour menu has half off of individual pizzas, several different sushi rolls, fish or chicken tacos, calamari, and more.  In general, 6 of us go at a time.  We eat until at we are all stuffed, and drink until at least three of us are blowing about 0.06--or more.  And the bill INCLUDING tax and a 20% tip, NEVER goes above $140.00.  Special recommendations:  The calamari, spicy tuna rolls, california rolls (ask for no mayo on them), and the fish tacos.  If you are a serious avocado fan, they have an avocado eggroll, but I am seriously warning you, there are 4 halves on the plate and you absolutely will not be able to eat all 4.  They are just too rich.  I want to go NOW, but happy hour doesn't start until 3.  Let me mention a few other things that I like about it, but that might turn you off--or on, you never know.  The HH specials are only available on the patio or in the bar.  The Patio overlooks the valet parking.  This, in particular, is one of my favorite things.  I once saw a guy completely dressed in red from head to foot--seriously, red cap to red shoes, get out of a red Rolls Royce with Burberry headrests and red leather upholstery.  I'm still laughing.  I also get to see great classics, awesome Ferraris, etc....  Oh, and the bathroom is pretty far away downstairs. I actually like this since I get to walk through the entire restaurant and people-watch.",

I thought it was too dark and the service was all out of whack especially considering the fact that the place was practically empty.  The hostess and the runner seemed to be frenimies and it was a lil ackward! We sat down and looked at the unnecessarily complicated menu... nothing really outstanding. The usual overprices Japanese-y selection with the occasional hit of Hawaiian... but it was just Americanized Japanese cuisine. I've had Hawaiian food, its wonderful... what the heck was this?   The people there kept giving us the once over and threw their nose in the air... just to get a lil revenge, we put our Louis Vuitton and Tiffany bags on the table and went over our recent purchases (those reviews coming soon!) and the looks of snobby angst turned to jealously like THAT! lol... I could see this attitude if it were some high priced exclusive resturant that required a jacket for dinner serivce... but a freakin' wanna-be Hawaiian that's in a MALL?!? Are you serious?! Ugh Scottsdale! *eye roll*  I had the rainbow roll and the dumplings, they were good, decent. No serious complaints, but still not great and stellar. I don't think I'll go back and sit in the resturant. I think I'll go to my local sushi place down the way from my place. Same food, same quality, different price! To my yelpers I say: skip it, you're not missing much... and though it may be Scottsdale, do you REALLY expect to find a good meal at a freakin' mall??",

We were greeted with a smile & pleasant introduction by our server Grady who was knowledgeable about all of the menu items and we settled on the dragon roll and California roll.  Both selections were impressive and fresh.  Grady was an amazing server who balanced the amount of attention he gave us and our desire for quiet conversation.  We were visited by the manager who asked about our experience, which was appreciated.  We look forward to dining at Kona again and will ask for Grady!!!",

Especially if you've had a long day or are one of those funky people watchers, a table on the patio would be great for you.  For lunch or dinner - not the greatest menu, but the food isn't horrible. Just make sure you know what you're ordering and be aware that the portions aren't exactly generous.  Servers are usually nice, although i must say they have gone downhill in the last few years. I prefer the servers at Chandler Mall, but oh well.",

My youngest son spilled a large root beer about ten minutes into our arrival. We informed the waiter and showed him the very large puddle on one other son AND on the floor. He nodded his head and proceeded to talk to the young ladies seated at the table next to us, he then walked away and started chatting with another waiter. He was in no rush to remove the hazard or help my son dry off. About 20 minutes latter, no napkins and no clean up. Three little girls walked through the root beer on their way to the fish tank. At this point my son spoke to the manger. We waited another ten minutes, nothing. I then approached the manager. His idiotic excuse was that they had no towels. PATHETIC. I guess these people won't wake up until someone falls and cracks their head open.",

    "text": "I can't think of anything I would rather do than eat out--sorry husband, I'm an eater, not a lover.  Thus, I was deeply saddened that we made the mistake of choosing to eat here after running an errand at the mall.  We arrived during linner (in between lunch and dinner) so not very busy at all.  Yet, it was still 10 minutes to even get our drink order taken.  Just as we were about to leave, our sorry excuse for a server shows up.  We were very curt, not rude, with her so she must have got the point.  She now overcompensates by trying to be our BFF.  It's clear where she was at during our arrival--running her mouth to anyone who would listen.  My husband ordered a dragon roll (he said it was just okay) and she proceeds to quiz him about why he likes it because she's never tried it, and further explains she has always wanted to ask her customers that but is usually too busy.  Now the dumb ass had admitted she's not busy.  He also orders miso soup as an appetizer.  Less than five minutes into the dragon roll, his entree arrives.  No soup.  The server comes by and asks \"did you ever get your soup?\"  Yes, he ate it and the empty bowl it was so good.  She generously took the non-existent soup off our bill-no apology.  I had the macadamia nut chicken, and the server made sure to tell me what a good choice I made because that is their signature dish.  For a signature dish, it was just okay.  Chicken done nicely, but could have used a little more of the chutney.  My husband had the seared ahi (which was a little more than seared, slightly overcooked) with a sweet chili sauce that looked like either a blind person plated it or the server tripped because sauce was spilled over one side of the plate.  Server again disappeared in between my husband's plate being removed and my finishing.  I suggested we tip $4.19 so she can buy a gallon of gas to look for a new job, but we opted on a 10% tip as we have had worse.  Unlikely I will return however.",

Service: hmm....I think this is the area where it loses 2 stars on rating. Although our waiter was nice, I didn't feel that he was as attentive as he should be. When we first sat down, he showed up to take our order for drinks and appetizer. While we were waiting for it, he didn't give us glasses of water until we asked for them. When we finally got our food, he didn't stop by to give us refill on drinks until we asked him to get it. Overall, I think the service could have been better.   Food: we ordered the jalapeno tuna for appetizer and it was delicious. We also ordered Caterpillar roll. The avacado was soooo fresh it literally melts in my mouth. The last roll was the checkers roll. It was well decorated and delicious.   Rating: overall I think this place is decent. I'll come back here again for sushi. Hopefully the service will be better next time.",

There are several salads, as you might expect, and several veggie rolls that are completely plant-based. Not all of the salad dressings are vegan (and they recommend one that's not!) so if you're ordering vegan keep that in mind and also, please give them feedback on their vegan menu (corrections, suggestions, etc.). They have a pasta entree - sounded Italian and blah (what's wrong with Japanese noodle dishes?), but I didn't try this...maybe it's good. They don't have any vegan desserts - it's like they don't want our money.   The grilled vegetable salad had way too much oil on it, but it was still really good. Next time I will ask them to hold the oil. The veggie rolls were all really good - and just as fun to eat as fish rolls, but without the decaying fish burps later on. Service was good.

The patio seating is first come first serve.   I got the sangria, calamari, and chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps.  The sangria was good - I couldn't even finish it all bc after a few sips, I was starting to feel it.  The food is unexceptional, but reasonable prices for happy hour.  The calamari was cold, way too chewy and the lettuce wraps seemed bland.  My friend and I didn't feel compelled to eat it all, but we did stay there for a good 1-2 hours chatting away.",

    "text": "[First time Out-of-Towner for Spring Training]  Mall food is always a gamble...  Mall food has stepped its game up, especially at Fashion Square. We saw a few restaurants, but we were hesitant because they always seem to chain places - lucky for us out-of-towners, we didn't recognize either of them. We decided on Kona Grill, the girls were craving sushi-ish type of food.  We'd heard they had a reverse happy hour, so that was also a plus in the decision making process. We were an hour early, but I think we got the good end of the stick, because we were there for awhile. We decided to sit on the patio, because every time we saw it, it looked fun and a chill spot.  Being the Cali girls we are, we totally forgot about smoking!! Cali girl FAIL! We had people puffing all around us, which isn't KG's fault, our own...but gross! Cig smoke and dinner just don't go together.  The patio is awesome, tons of TV's to catch any game. Lots of people watching, especially because it is by the entrance of the mall. \"Snots\"dale was becoming more and more evident as we spent time in this area.  The menu was super cute. Great job design team, very cute and urban, without jeopardizing the masculinity. I went with the Cool Cucumber Mojito (bonus for skinny girls, only 110 calories). It was tart, yet refreshing. I really enjoyed it and it seemed to be the largest Mojito I've ever indulged in. The girls really liked their drinks...but I can't recall what they ordered, they were on the drink menu...we went 3 for 3, not bad   False advertisement warning: The Shrimp Penne is SPICY. Those haunting little red pepper flakes infested my meal :( I am very aware of when menus indicate spicy and this did NOT say that, I think...this thing was burning my mouth on impact :/ I didn't want to send it back, we all know what happens when you do that...unmentionables, but I had too! I couldn't stand it after 3 bites. The non-mouth-numbing version was great. The shrimp were decent and the butter, wine, lemon sauce was great. The garlic bread is amazing, my inner carb lover was giddy as can be.  The other dishes ordered that were pretty good as well. The sushi platter even came with a huge side salad. The sushi was basic, but fresh, can't ask for much more than that. The fried rice comes with Chinese Sausage, but the rice was crunchy...it was an interesting combo...not sure which way I'd go on that. The seared Ahi is plated beautifully and tastes delicious as well, very thinly sliced.  Chris our server was great from the start. Even through sadness of my painfully spicy meal made into a normal non-spicy version. He was kind, funny, and helpful. He even went above and beyond and gave us some good places to go out on the town...being newbie's and all, we asked everyone...  My taste buds are still recovering, but I won't hold it against Kona Grill...",

It's another large, sub-par chain joint with prices that are comparable to normal, non-HH alcohol prices anywhere that's more than 50 feet from a Louis V store.  I'm just not a fan of patios that extend into a parking garage when you're in Scottsdale and every respectable business has a much better patio.  If you've shopped till you can't walk any further, then yes - Kona is your promised land, but to everyone else - PLEASE stop showing Midwesterners this place like it's some sort of symbol of the Southwest and take them to a  place with character!",

There was a bit of a funky, sewer type smell in the bar area.  I was worried a first, but they opened the doors to the patio area and a nice breeze came in.  We ordered the avocado egg roll appetizer and a Houston sushi roll.  The eggs rolls were good, but the honey dipping sauce is probably what makes them stand out.  The houston roll is made with ahi, fresh jalapeno, and cream cheese and was just delightful.  We split the Salmon entree with rice and broccoli.  It was moist and flavorful,  and a bit sweet.  Overall a very good experience.  We were dressed in athletic clothes and brought in our shopping bags and felt completely comfortable.  Service and food were friendly and prompt.  After I had already ordered a glass of wine, I noticed a \"skinny\" drink menu with cocktails around 100 calories.  The mojito and margarita sounded great for next time.",

Nice clean places with all the sushi being made in from of you while you watch if you sit at the sushi bar section.   The Chicken Chili, Caterpillar Rolls, Atlantic Rolls and Spicy Tuna Rolls are my usual order. Sometimes I go crazy and get egg rolls with avocado too which are great.   This trip in 2 nights ago we learned NOT TO TRY THE DAQURI DRINKS! It tasted like the drinks came out of a chemical bath and I thought they were supposed to be iced like everywhere else....   Our server this trip was a young dark haired guy who took care of our party of 15 table and was polite.   All in all... Kona is a good spot...

From entry with the host stand (3 people standing there and we had to stare and wait and ask for their attention) to the slow service we received at our table (we were done with our food by the time it took the bar/server to bring us another beer) and then the food was lackluster (was like we were dining at a tiny-food restaurant - see photos of sushi).

Remember it is available only in the patio area, Bar and Lounge where it gets super crowded, noisy and the service is a hit or miss.  If you sit in the restaurant the average cost of an entree is about $18 but it will be quieter and the service is much better.  We got the Shrimp tempura tossed in a spicy citrus aioli $12 Macadamia nut chicken $19.75 (mashed potatoes, seasonal vegetables, cream, pineapple-papaya marmalade) Pad Thai noodles $17 (chicken, rice noodles, bean sprouts and crushed peanuts, in spicy black bean chilli sauce.you can substitute shrimp or get both)  Everything was perfect. The Macadamia nut chicken is one of my favourites the marmalade is exquisite. If you are a fan of sushi, sashimi or good food give this place a try.  Cheers!",

I asked where's the sashimi, she said it's sashimi over rice. This makes no sense since sashimi has no rice and nigiri is raw fish over rice. For $26 this was not worth it. Plus, the tuna didnt taste fresh and I couldnt even finish more than two. Plus, our order took so long. We only ordered that one dish and a fish dish. Plus she forgot soy sauce and when I asked for it, she forgot and remembered when we were staring at her walking towards us empty handed. She was a nice waitress but forgot things often. I ordered water without lemon and she brought both waters with lemon. We asked her to split the bill and she said she forgot and so she brought a split bill and one full bill. It wss all underwhelming. From food to service.",

The server was nice enough, but I couldn't help but feel the disappointment in her facial expressions when ordering items from the happy hour menu. I've noticed this reaction at other restaurants as well. You almost feel obligated to order more, and then you remember that you didn't go out for lunch with the intention of dropping a bunch of money - and that should be okay. A big part of it boils down to the tipping system America adopted, which isn't a thing anywhere else in the world, that has wait staff thirsty for those big checks that are often accompanied by larger tips.  Anyway, back to Kona Grill.. The food was alright. I liked my barbeque chicken flatbread well enough. My wife wasn't too crazy about her calamari. She finished it, but she mentioned that she'll never order that particular item again. I do enjoy their patio. It's packed, but manages to stay cool in the shade. And last but not least, the food was out pretty fast. Kudos on that.",

I'll start off by saying a couple praises about the place: 1) Dining room and the atmosphere were awesome, very comfortable, and 2) Lighting and decor matched the atmosphere, especially the large fish tank.   Here's where it went wrong for us: first off, we were not greeted until about 10 minutes after we had sat down. Secondly, my girlfriend had asked for medium rare on her steak, and it came out rare to the point where she couldn't eat it but we didn't say anything but should've. Thirdly, my pad Thai noodles came with shrimp but I could have sworn the shrimp said it was an upcharge and I actually didn't want shrimp with my noodles. Finally, it seemed like our server, Roselinne, was inattentive and didn't even say \"thanks guys have a good night.\" Just dropped the checks and left. What really ruined the experience was that Roselinne had charged my card twice but didn't even INFORM me of this until I checked my bank account. I work in the food service industry and if I did that to a customer, I would immediately inform them. Don't expect to see us again there.",

I love Kona's Happy Hour menu and the sushi is mighty tasty. The wine selection is ample and allows me many choices that fit my palate. Today it was David Mondavi's creation Spellbound. Spellbound was born of the idea that all life's moments can be captivating, no matter the time or place.  I kind of get that unless I'm in a FN argument with my girlfriend. However, wine does make that a little better! Today was the California Roll. I'm a wimp when it comes to the raw stuff. Anything that I can't identify visually is what I stay away from; it's like a Fear Factor thing. It was great and all of the ingredients were fresh. The soy wasabi I mixed made it killer and I even scarfed it with chop sticks in hand.  This mall is a little bit too much Biff and Erma for me. You know, the ones that think they are better than the person next to them. Ugh! Get real folks. Your friends ONLY like you because you have money. Dah... Anyway, outside of those annoying conversations in the mall walkways, this place rocks and it is a great stop anytime of the day. Oh, I think I need a wet-wipe to clean off the pretentious that stuck on me... #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate",

We told him we had only 35 minutes before our movie at 7:30.  He explained that the Sushi bar was backed up so Poke would take a bit longer.  I ordered the Chopped Salad & Boo got the Chimichuri Flank steak.  The chopped Salad was excellent one of the best I've had.  It had very tasty bacon, cherry tomatoes, boil egg, & greens with just the right amount of honey dijon mustard dressing.  It was a huge serving.  The Flank steak was flavorful but very chewy & tough.  The chimichuri sauce was delicious as were the green beans & mashed potatoes.  We were able to order, eat & check out within 30 minutes.  Brandon was super attentive & very personable. We will definitely return.",

    "text": "I've had the pleasure of going to Kona Grill twice and both times I was not disappointed. The most recent excursion was this past Friday for a friend's birthday get together and we had the best time. I ordered the eel sashimi and split a Philadelphia roll with a friend and both were phenomenal. I also took the opportunity to finally have desert as I usually don't get the pleasure of sampling deserts at restaurants due to being full and ordered the banana cream pie. I received a massive piece of pie and the presentation of the plate was stunning and delicious. Definitely got my money's worth on that one!  As for drinks two friends ordered wine and seemed to be enjoying them immensely, I myself has a lovely Cos[medic] Martini and I got the sample a friend's chocolate martini which was simply delicious.  The server was friendly and attentive, prompt to show up when a party guest would trickle in here or there to make sure they were served, and even helped us order a surprise sampler plate for the birthday girl from the rest of us. Speaking of the birthday girl, she got a complimentary miso soup and I believe a cupcake as well.   We had a slight billing mix-up which was understandable since we were all splitting checks and our party came in over a period of time which I'm sure made it slightly harder to keep track of everything. They were quick to sort it all out with minimal fuss which was appreciated.  On a closing note Kona Grill does offer other cuisine besides Japanese which is helpful for someone like me who loves sushi but has a boyfriend who does not. Definitely a place I recommend going, especially if you need a break from wandering the mall and don't want to battle for a spot in the food court.",

It opens up to a fume infested patio rank with car exhaust. how clean is it to have car exhaust fumes settling onto your food?   most entrees are between $10 and $25  flashy place that is a good meeting place. Food is average at best.  We sat on the patio at a hi-top table and the service from some blonde was WAY BELOW responsive or even adequate. In fact, the patio was 60% full and she did not keep up at all and when she did show you some attention she showed actual contempt for her customers. sad - very sad. I sat for 12 minutes before she even approached me, I ordered a draft beer - she forgot it - I had to flag down another server to get my beer - then I was double billed  very frustrating experience on a night that was less than busy. I am sorry but Scottsdale is way to competitive to repeat at a place that really was average at best",

To start off the service can be hit or miss. I had good service today, the hostess's name was Ariella and she was very nice and accommodating. I have eaten sushi here in the past and I would steer anyone away from it. I would recommend Stingray or even RA down the street on Scottsdale Road if you are looking for decent sushi. I had a rainbow roll here once and it tasted like rotten fish - disgusting. This was not enough to completely drive me away because I had also had the pan Asian noodles with beef which were amazing and delicious.  Today for lunch I had the perfect pairings lunch menu and I had the clam chowder and Caesar salad (yes I had soup in 118 degree weather and it was delicious). I would highly recommend the clam chowder here, it does have bacon in it and it is amazing. The Caesar salad was fresh and the Caesar dressing was very tasty.  Overall I have had hit or miss experiences at Kona Grill. I will be back for the clam chowder, never the sushi and maybe some drinks.",

We sat on the patio which always makes for great people watching and I ordered the ladies margarita and the sweet chili glazed salmon it came with shrimp fried rice and veggies. I made the perfect choice because everything was AHmazing! The salmon was cooked just right and I could have literally pored that sweet chili goodness over everything on the plate!

Add a couple tall Kirins and some sake and I walk outta there feeling great for between $25-$30.  I've paid that much for ONE sake bomber in other parts of the country.    I've been to a half-dozen Konas across the country (New Jersey, Tampa, Dallas, Houston, Denver, Kansas City, and all the AZ locations) and this is my favorite.  Nice clientele.  The real douchey Scottsdale d-bags don't really come here.  It's a tamer crowd but attractive, clean, and fairly affluent (it IS Scottsdale and it IS next to the Scottsdale Fashion Square).  The Chandler and Gilbert locations get more of your \"let's take the quads out to the dunes in Yuma\" kinda folk so, yeah, the Scottsdale location is more my speed.

We ordered two apps and two entrees and the main problem was the fruit flies...tons of them were flying all over our food and drinks. We weren't sitting at the bar (where, fine, you may expect this to happen a bit), but at a regular table. The annoying part was that a few of them flew into our bottle of wine so we notified the waitress and she spoke with the manager. We had at least half a bottle of wine left and the mgt decided to take less than half off the price of the wine. Seems tacky to me - it's not like we just didn't like it - the place wasn't clean.

Their drink menu, combined with their discounted rolls / flatbreads / appetizers are fantastic.  I can't quite give the joint five stars because outside of the discounted time, I just think most of their menu is overpriced.  This night, at this location, our service was outstanding.  Within minutes of sitting down we had three sake bombers with a big ol' bottle of Kirin light and we were happy almost instantly.  There were a few people smoking on the porch, but not anywhere near our table so it wasn't a problem whatsoever.  For food we got the calamari, the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps, a Philly roll and flatbread to share between the six of us.  Perfect amount of food and the bill was more than reasonable.  It should be noted that there were no less than four dudes rocking Affliction shirts who were more interested in their phones than their beautiful arm candy - but whatever.",

We ordered 5 of the appetizers. All of them were scrumptious. The avocado egg rolls and the sauce were outstanding--a must try. Would recommend this Kona Grill at the Fashion Square Mall to everyone.",

That ought to have registered as a red flag but since I was starving I guess my mental acuity was off. The hostess sat us in the back of the restaurant with a clear view of the hallway leading to the restrooms. We commented to our hostess that we were awful close to the restrooms. She chirped, yeah. End of discussion. I ordered a grey goose on the rocks, you know, vodka and ice in a glass. What I got back wasn't grey goose and it was mixed with soda, but it was in a glass though. My wife ordered a rib eye sandwich, medium. What she got was still breathing. My Korean chicken was almost warm but I attribute most of that to the spices. It was good but not great. I will say that our server was terrific and the manager did come by to check on us. This used to be a good spot but seems to be going through a transition period to become mediocre. Too bad.",

Just to be clear, Ellensburg is very small and has limited dining opportunities.  HOWEVER, all of my experiences in my small town GREATLY exceed my dining experience at KONA SUCK.  My friend and I went for happy hour.  We received a watered down margarita (I ordered a second shot and it was still awful and a sad Tisdale cab, let's clarify that this is a bottom-shelf wine from Fred Meyer!).  Disgusting.  Then we received a sad tuna roll with stale and chewy seaweed, and perhaps more disappointingly, a \"chicken and shrimp on romaine wrap\" that was actually a frozen dinner style chopped chicken and salad shrimp stir-fry with too much sauce on BIBB LETTUCE not romaine.  It was AWFUL.  Please do not eat here, go to PF Changs and order the delicious Coconut Vegetable Curry.  Delicious.  Kona Grill = Applebee's. I can't believe this last of quality was delivered at Fashion Square.  Happy eating elsewhere!",

We sat upstairs in the bar and I believe our servers name was Josh. I love Sangria and Kona makes theirs with Sake. I'm not a fan of Sake but this was really yummy!   We had the potstickers for an appetizer, my daughter had a sushi roll and I ordered the fish tacos with fried rice. The only hiccup to the whole meal was that the fried rice had cooked pineapple in it and I'm allergic to that. But, this was my mistake because I didn't read the description. Josh was very professional about it when I called him over to our table, taking it back to the kitchen and having them make it again without the pineapple.  So many things in the menu sound really good so I'll be back for sure!",

My biggest compliment goes to Nick Laban (spelling ?) It's not often you get a server who you can tell enjoys what they do and wants to make sure the customer enjoys their dining experience. Nick was very attentive and even joked a little bit to make our experience fun. I had my 14yr old, so fun is always important! Ha! I've been coming to Kona for YEARS and never had a server do the warm hand towelettes after our meal. VERY COOL!! See video!",

    "text": "I just moved to Arizona from California and I'm an avid sushi connoisseur. This is only the 2nd sushi spot I've checked out so far. I went to Kona Grill yesterday around 3pm which is when their happy hour starts.   You have to eat within the outside patio and bar in order to get the happy hour deals on appetizers, rolls etc. If you dine inside you'll only be to order from the regular menu. $6.00 appetizers, and half price on select sushi rolls.  The outdoor patio is directly under the parking structure and have misters going the entire time to ensure you stay cool while you dine. A heads up for parking! I parked in the regular uncovered parking lot for free. If you choose to park valet in the covered parking its going to cost you $7.00.  This is what I ordered: Drinks: 1 water and 1 diet coke Appetizer - Kona Calamari  Rolls - Philly Roll, Atlantic Roll, and Fiery Shrimp Roll  My take on the Kona calamari : The calamari was presented on a bed of shredded lettuce, and was a mixture of the octopus legs and rings. It also came with a dipping sauce. The calamari was not salty at all kind of bland but that was fixed with a few dips in the dipping sauce which was a bit tangy and  a few dips in  a soy sauce/wasabi/ginger mix.  My take on the Philly Roll: I liked their Philly Roll. It had a nice smokey flavor to it which I'm not sure if it was the cream cheese or salmon.  My take on the Atlantic Roll: The crunchy tempura really makes this roll, it's not the best roll we've had but it was pretty good over all.  My take on the Fiery Shrimp Roll: I expected it to be hot based on it's name, but it's quite deceiving. First off there was next to no spice or fire and there was little to no shrimp.   Service: Service was actually quite good as the waitress kept me hydrated. The only thing that I seemed to notice was the lack of napkins at every table, The only napkins provided outside were the ones for our drinks. If you want them you got to ask for them. Also I had to ask the server for utensils after they dropped off the first round of food. Other than that my overall experience was good. I will definitely be back again to try out other items on their regular menu.   They had some pretty decent adult beverage deals going on during happy hour.If you are looking for a spot to do business talk or just hang out with friends and have a few drinks and affordable sushi then I would recommend you checking this place out.  Until next time cheers and Happy Eating!  CC",

I have a huge appetite so I usually get far too much food then chase it with far too much alcohol and I usually escape this place after tip and tax for $25ish. I think someone who only got 1-2 items from the happy hour and maybe 1-2 drinks could escape for under 15$.   If you have not been here for Happy Hour...do it....a little hard to find a spot because its not exactly a secret...but if you find a table.....you'll thank me.

Ordered a 16 dollar shrimp poke bowl for lunch here over the weekend.  Shrimp was tossed in a spicy sauce and served with all of the basic poke bowl ingredients.  Although the shrimp were flavorful the rest of the bowl was served without any sauce and thus the bowl was bland. It was also very small considering the price point.  My meal was not bad (the food was fresh) but just eh. I learned after dining here that the location closest to my house (which I had never tried) has gone out of business.  Not surprised...",

    "text": "BACKGROUND   The first time I ever went to Kona Grill was many years ago, on a date night, at the Chandler Mall location, when Kona Grill was first on the scene.  I liked the edgy decor with flash fish tanks, et cetera.  But that was before there were so many sushi options, so the Kona Grill meant a bit more than it does now.  Now there's a sushi bar in every strip mall, usually owned and operated by \"locals,\" and thus, the \"chain\" sushi establishments are taking heat.  Whatever. I can remember the past, and I thank Kona Grill for their contributions and good times before everyone and their mother owned a sushi bar.  This Scottsdale location is the original, where it all started; hence, it was \"local\" at sometime before the concept was franchised out, and is still \"local\" if you think about it.  Anyway, who cares about all \"chain\" drama if the food is good and the service is excellent? Not me, that's for sure.  KONA GRILL  Kona Grill is a midrange casual restaurant company based in Scottsdale, Arizona, serving American cuisine, sushi, and cocktails.   The company owns and operates 46 restaurants in 23 United States and Puerto Rico, as well as three international locations operating under franchise agreements.  Kona Grill first opened its doors on September 18, 1998 at the Scottsdale Fashion Square.   The restaurant's predecessor was a sushi concept called Sushi on Shea that opened in Scottsdale in 1994.   Restaurant founder, Michael McDermott, decided to create Kona Grill with more American-themed menu items.   The new restaurant was made to have a modern ambiance. McDermott sold Sushi on Shea in 2002 to focus on expanding Kona Grill.  Kona Grill went public on August 16, 2005 with an initial public offering of $11 per share on the NASDAQ. The company raised $28.8 million and grew its restaurant base to 9 locations by December 31, 2005.  THE STORY & SERVICE EXPERIENCE  I was shopping at the gorgeous Scottsdale Fashion Mall, and stopped by this location of Kona Grill.  I sat at the sushi bar, and chatted with the sushi chef. I enjoyed myself.  The waitress brought over a Chambord margarita, which I sipped with my jalapeno roll. I especially liked their scratch-made citrus soy sauce, which I thought was very original and tasty.  CONCLUSION  Kona Grill has consistent good sushi, excellent cocktails, with great service. This location is my favorite so far. Kona Grill gets my vote.  4/5 RECOMMEND  OF NOTE  *This location is inside the Scottsdale Fashion Mall, so parking is in the garage.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fkonagrill.com&s=b9c356c6a4bd994c2350bd8213bfd5bd8bc018c44a181fbadd6680cde6c3fc95\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">konagrill.com</a>",

Why I'm giving them four stars is because (1) the staff was super friendly and attentive, and (2) they had an awesome late night happy hour.  It starts at 9:00 PM and there's tons of stuff (rolls, beer, mixed drinks) all for $5.  Three of us ate and drank like kings (including desert) and we barely cracked $100!",

Over server was not very friendly, never mentioned his name and asked us what we wanted to drink. Our waters never came until we asked him again. I had the Pad Thai and my wife had the Macadamia Nut Chicken.  Our meals were pretty good, my noodles were cooked just right, I ordered it with add-on shrimp. but I didn't find the chicken unless it was pulverized. My wife's chicken was cooked perfectly and moist, but the breading was sliding off the chicken. After taking a couple of bites, the manager strolled by to see if everything tasted okay.  yes. Our sever never came by to check on us until we were done and asked if we wanted dessert. Nope! Just fill my water glass, please. Of course e'll be back, it's just a matter of when.",

So I was surprised when the restaurant just seemed like it was let go. It wasn't necessarily dirty, but it seems a little run down for what I envisioned. Also the service was kind of spotty. We waited awhile to be helped & were checked on very much. But when it came to the food, my mother and I both enjoyed our plates. It was rather yummy. Torn if I will go back.",

As a sit down proper restaurant in the mall (as opposed to the food courtyard) it was ok.  Our server Miss Aden was the highlight of our stay. She is an upbeat wonderful server with the ability to be helpful without hovering. Her wonderful attitude and service was great!   Using the Yelp app we received a free appetizer,,, so Thanks Yelp! We ordered the Spicy Lettuce Wraps which turned out to be fantastic! The taste was wonderful and the cucumber side salad fit perfectly when a cool-down was needed cause the spicy was hot... Nice! Additionally ordered Spicy Shrimp Tempura and this was also very good~had a great kick. Guess we should have stopped there but had ordered a bottle of Petite Syrah that we had not yet finished killing; so on we go! California Roll and Yellowtail Sushi,,, hmmm? Looked a bit sad (please see pic) and so was I :(  Would return as the menu has lots to offer but most likely will skip the aforementioned sushi. Miss Aden was so accommodating, we'll be coming back to this Kona Grill.",

He was super kind and very attentive throughout the experience. He casually checked up on us and he always made sure they our food was great. He even offered me different teas to make sure that my drink was to my liking. Furthermore, he even took the time to make sure that the order was right, since one of our order was wrong (which wasnt his fault), and i believe that was very thoughtful to do so.   Overall, I am honestly blown away by the service from him. It was the best service ever.   Next, the food was also extremely good. The plating was also spectacular and detailed. It appealed not only to my taste but my eyes as well. The food was also very flavorful and generously seasoned. Nothing was overcooked or lacking in flavor.   In the end, I will come back again and I hope to get John as my waiter. He gave my group an excellent service and brought out food that was spectacular.",

Before we decided to move to the patio (it was too noisy earlier), she ordered a peach martini made w/ sake, and I a glass of Red Diamond Merlot.  Alison was feeling like having the Kona calamari (HH price $5).  It's been years since I had KG's and I couldn't recall if I liked it, but I mentioned that if we moved to the bar or patio, that happy hour would start in fifteen minutes and we could order that and something else at happy hour prices!  It took a little arm-twisting, but Alison relented ;)    Why did I stay away for so long?!  Oh yeah, I remember now... Mom and I used to frequent Chandler's KG our first two years in the valley, but it just got harder and harder to find an empty table at the bar/patio, plus it was always so noisy!  I really like Scottsdale's location- not too noisy outside, especially if you're lucky enough to snap up a table at a corner or at the outer edges.  Besides the calamari, <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kona-grill-scottsdale?select=v5-BEzsK6s-j2vilNDG3sA#v5-BEzsK6s-j2vilNDG3sA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kona...</a>  we also tried the Five-spice Barbecue Chicken pizza ($5), <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/kona-grill-scottsdale?select=yNfFV0_BeMetIbVMcDIWng#yNfFV0_BeMetIbVMcDIWng\">yelp.com/biz_photos/kona...</a>  and she ordered a Bud-light ($2) and I a glass of House red merlot ($4).

There was lint/dust on and in my wine glass so I politely asked for a new glass. She didn't acknowledge my request but stormed away quietly to get a new glass. Upon handling a new glass she clearly noticed the new glass was dirty so I saw her clean the glass. Which I appreciated!  When she placed my new glass down she never said anything. I guess I was hoping for a \"I'm so sorry about that.\"  Then when we ordered our sushi she still never even said one word. I really wasn't trying to be a pain by asking for a new glass. I just prefer to not hAve dust on my glass. I truly feel bartenders and servers should have great personalities. To top it off, she spilled the soy sauce and it got on my husbands shorts and in my purse. Never said 1 word about it. The service here is going to run this place to the ground. We won't be back. Not worth having us feel bad about ourselves.",

Most sushi places I go to their HH food menu only provides deep fried dishes which I rarely order from. I usually order non-deep fried rolls because I can taste how fresh the stuff I eat. Kona Grill has wide variety of selections on their HH menu. Sake Sangria was perfect for me as I like drinks that are fruity. The Vegetable rolls were good and I can taste the freshness of the vegetables. Chicken Satay, the chicken was tender and juicy. Beef Bulgogi Tacos, beef was wrapped with a soft shell with some shredded cabbage, carrots and some other veg/plants. This will be my go to place for sure.",

Once up in the bar, the service was great. The food on the other hand wasn't anything to write home about... The avocado egg rolls were filled w/ just avocado, and no seasoning. The potstickers had pre-cooked crumbly chicken filling inside, rather than being raw & seasoned, before cooking through in the fryer...just a weird way to do it... The sushi was a joke, and shouldn't even be called sushi.. Pass on the wave roll & the  bama roll.  But really, it's my mistake thinking that i could find good sushi at a place like this. It's built more for ambiance than food quality.    Great pl for a drink & non-Asian food...",

Thank heavens I didn't need him for anything because he was scarce. The sushi roll came to the bar before my silverware. hmmm. I chose the spicy salmon roll. I enjoyed it!  However, I wouldn't call it  \"spicy\"!  The wasabi that I put on it gave it a nice kick though! ;-)  I had to flag down Brent to request my check. He obliged, but never came back to pickup my card.

Also the bathrooms are beautiful with awesome faucets.... These things matter people.   The food was hit or miss for me. The avacado egg rolls were great but my wife and I were both disappointed by the Caesar salad. The dressing was lite and odd tasting. It wasn't bad but didn't taste like a traditional Caesar salad. For our entrees I got the macadamia nut chicken and was completely blown away. This is a delicious dish and I loved it! I will definitely be coming back for that macadamia nut chicken.   Our waitress was fantastic and they have key lime pie, always a plus in my book. The price of the dinner was high, but we were both very satisfied with the quality of the food. Just fix that Caesar dressing!!!!",

If you're not looking to drive/walk anywhere else, Kona Grill may do.   It was a nice evening and we were able to easily find seating on their outdoor patio. While it overlooks the street leading to the parking lot, it's OK. Having the misters on was cooling, but I have a pet peeve about mister water getting into my drinks and/or food. Who knows where that water has been?!?! While the tables and chairs were comfortable, the noise level was through the roof (and this is coming from someone who enjoys a boisterous setting!) Between the cars, a birthday celebration and the music, I could barely hear my friend sitting about two feet away.   We stopped in for a quick drink and a few apps to share. We had the California Roll (fresh!), the Potstickers (good wonton prep but undescernable filling) and the Margherita Flatbread (yummy, but a little on the sweet side with the Balsamic drizzle.) My friend's beer was cold and crisp. My Ladies Margarita was almost too alcoholic. (Proportion, people!!!)  The food portion sizes were adequate and the Reverse Happy Hour prices were attractive.  Our server was pleasant and attentive. *HE* seemed amiable enough, but I felt like I was just a number and here's why. Before the evening was over, another man in a shirt and tie who didn't identify himself asked if everything was ok and disappeared before I could finish my reply. Total time spent at the table: less than two seconds. This has \"manager completing his required stop\" all over it. There was nothing genuine about his concern, other than it seemed he got \"points\" from his employer for having asked the question. This small act can have a lasting impression. It did. Just wasn't a good one.",

They did advise us when we arrived that happy hour was going on but only upstairs (which I still do not understand  why that is a thing).  Anyway we were seated downstairs, ordered drinks, an appetizer to share and entrees.  Then my son (who has asthma) said he felt cold.  At that point I informed our server we were moving upstairs and to an outside table.    Another server came over and we informed him that we moved up from downstairs.  Seemingly annoyed he said \"well, did you close out with your server down there?...\"  I immediately asked to speak with the manager because I knew this person was not going to be helpful.  Our first server then tried to come by and bring us the full check from downstairs with items we hadn't even received!  We asked her also to please bring us the manager.  The manager finally arrives and we explain that we simply came upstairs and would like to eat up here.  He then tries to mansplain to us that the way they ring up items upstairs is different than downstairs almost as if to suggest we're inconveniencing them.  It was at that point my wife had enough, she went off on the manager.    I'll say this much, I will never again visit an establishment that assumes I moved tables to try and get happy hour pricing.  The health and comfort of my children will always come first.",

I ordered the pad thai with shrimp and chicken and it was delicious. Just the right amount of sweetness and heat. This is an American version but an excellent one! (From London and more authentic there!). The others had lettuce wraps, tuna crisps, fish tacos, satay skewers, sliders etc. All delicious. The food was well prepared and the wait was minimal.

Make sure you ask to sit upstairs as you will pay full price on the ground level. Talk about a great time at a great price in Scottsdale",

    "text": "I have been a huge fan of Kona Grill since they opened the one in Iselin, NJ, where I'm originally from. I went there quite often, so I was happy to find there were Konas in AZ when I moved out here.  I have been to this location many times, and order it from postmates with my coworkers frequently. I have always had great experiences here - with the food and service- until recently.    Last week, my friends and I came in to grab some drinks and food to catch up before heading to see a movie. At first, our server Calvin seemed great - very friendly and attentive....until he went MIA. We were all due for another round of drinks, and no one came back to us for at least 25 minutes. I made it pretty obvious that I was looking for a waiter, and no one picked up on it and came to check on us.  Finally, when Calvin came back, he reeked of marijuana. I thought maybe it was another customer that had come in or someone else walking by, but it was obvious it was him when he returned, and from there on out, he seemed a bit awkward.  I wanted to complain to a manager, but my friends convinced me to just let it go, since we were already pressed for time for our movie due to the slow service for the second half of our visit.  In addition, I religiously order the macadamia nut chicken--I'm obsessed with the pineapple marmalade! I've ordered this countless times, from several locations, and I've noticed that the past few times, the portions seem to be getting smaller and smaller, and on this particular visit, the chicken was tough and rubbery. VERY disappointing for a $21 entree!!!   After coming on here and seeing the other recent reviews regarding poor experiences at this location, it's clear this Kona needs to get its act together.  After my terrible experience last week -between Calvin's service and the poor quality/shrinking portion sizes of the chicken, I unfortunately won't be returning to this location again!",

My colleagues had a variety of things - pork sliders, sushi, global bowls. Everyone enjoyed their meals.

It is definitely a good place to go for happy hour. It may be my opinion but I think the prices are way too pricey when it is not happy hour. I would choose to spend my money else where for full priced items. They have good deals on their drinks for happy hour too even though the prices went up and they took the margarita off of hh.   Atmosphere: the patio is nice to sit on when it's not a trillion degrees outside and the bar has a sparkly countertop which is a nice touch   Service: service is always decent nothing outstanding or super poor.   If you're just around and wanna have some good casual food I would say give this place a try.  I would give it 3.5 stars if that were an option but I feel as though they deserve more than 3.",

Today I ordered happy hour and I was chronically under poured. 3 1/2 ounces  I think not. What seasoned bartender does not know their counts? If you must use a jigger fill it up do not under fill the jigger. My 8 dollar martini was very weak. Tip for those bartenders out there you want a good tip over pour do not under. I tip VERY WELL when I am happy, if I am unhappy I will not tip well. No I am not cheap I work way too hard for my money to be shortchanged. Servers and bartenders work on tips for the most part give good service get more money give horrible service and make no money. I have gone to other Kona grills and gotten Far superior service and left very content and the staff is very happy when I leave. Sadly I work here in this mall and live very close by and have no desire to return to this Kona Grill. Every time too many headaches followed by an attitude I am sick of it. Will not return, nor would I recommend friends or clients to come here. Kona you just lost a lot of business from me and my acquaintances.",

We had two drinks the place before and this was our last stop for dinner, NO ONE had more than two and NO ONE had acted drunk. We ordered with no issues, asked for waters and no one asked for a drink. When I went for one the manager came over and told me one girl at the table seemed drunk so they could not serve us. He then told me I was threatening him by just speaking to him... I'm so sick of this weak ass managers who can't deal with issues and think a horrible shirt and tattoos on your hand make you hard, he was anything but. I have been eating here for years and I have never dealt with this type of treatment, lame, ridiculous and my friend had to pay for the food we didn't eat because they didn't tell us they wouldn't serve us until AFTER they served us.

I came here Friday night with a group of people to celebrate a friends birthday, and I really enjoyed myself.  The menu is easy to read with a variety of different options. The descriptions help me order since I am completely in the dark about sushi.  In between the server and my friends, I ordered quite a few plates of different food and all of them were really tasty.  I think my favorite was the Las Vegas roll by far!  My friend and I also split the Philly roll along with a few other dishes as well.  They have some really strong chocolate martinis, and overall I had a really good experience here.  I think I like it here for a variety of reasons. For starters, its easy to order if your new to sushi like I am.  The server will help you if you have any questions, and I found the food to be really really good.  Not that other places are bad, but it can be overwhelming if you have no idea what your doing like me.  Also, they have plenty of stuff with out avocado in it since I think its one of the most disgusting foods in the entire world.  (I know some people will give me slack about it, but the consistency and lack of flavor completely turn me off and I just think its gross overall. This includes guacamole.)  If your not into sushi, they also have several other menu options such as burgers and sandwiches which I think is awesome!  I know if I came here again I can order just about anything, weather its a burger or a Las Vegas roll and know that I will enjoy myself.  Great menu, service and overall good time.

With the plates full on the table, the server didn't even inquire about why we didn't want the food boxed or ask us how the food was.

    "text": "I ordered the Big Kahuna Burger. It came relatively fast and the first thing I noticed was that the lettuce was shredded. Now, shredded lettuce is not a real big issue and I think most people don't care, but in my experience, I think it's really huge mess. So if you're not into shredded lettuce, watch out and request it not shredded. Also the bottom bun was soaked and was dissolving. The juice even made the fries soggy! The fries I felt were not exactly fresh either. They got cold really fast. I understand these kinds of burgers are huge and I guess you have to expect it's going to be really messy, but I just wasn't impressed at all. I've had this burger at another Kona Grill and I remembered that one to be really good; it wasn't a huge mess! In my opinion, if you're going to serve huge burgers, at least minimize the mess it's going to make. Maybe the burger and I weren't a good match today.....  Another issue I had this location was that the waitress tried to avoid our table because I'm pretty sure she knew I wasn't satisfied. She would have to pass by and threw a glance at us. She stopped for a sec to take a request, but rushed off, pretty much cutting me off. Instead, she just gave us boxes to hasten our leave! Then came and did the same thing when she brought the check. Now people will say she's just busy, but trust me, I reacted to the burger well enough to show I wasn't that satisfied because I barely ate it. I don't like being unreasonable, but I felt she was being rude by avoiding the criticism which I was going to be constructive about. I paid tip but I don't think she deserved it. Also, the girl who sat us in was also very disinterested. Service was busy at the time, but it was off nonetheless. I thank the manager who at least asked us if we were OK at first.",

Until 7:00pm half off selected apps including selected rolls...3 crab-stix and 1 spicy tuna. Average (rail / draft ) price $3.00. You have to sit in the upstairs bar area for the discount, which automatically puts you behind the 8-ball for good service.   The food was 'OK', I was unable to determine if the crab filling in the rolls was \"True crab\" , the pot sticker filling was much like flavored sawdust, however...the sweet and spicy shrimp were pretty good... so 2 out of 3 apps were decent.   See posted picture of suspect pot-stickers... proceed with caution!   if we make it back again, will opt for the pizza apps... they can't screw that up... right??   The Good: Location, views, prices  The Bad: Food..not the best  Just Plain Ugly: Pot sticker filling",

Spicy tuna roll was alright, but what's up with the dot of wasabi? There was no wasabi on that plate...  If you eat outside, you can see all the nice cars pulling up to the valet, but that's about it. Overall, good pricing, atmosphere was ok, service wasn't too bad.

We sat down outside on the patio...waited 5 minutes to get menus.  OK, I understand, if they were busy, which they we not.  Ordered a couple of water, so we could look over the drinks and food.  When the water came, my literally had floating objects in it.  OK, ordered drinks, then food.  Here is where stuff gets bad.  Like the 5 minutes for menus and floaties in the water wasnt bad enough.  44 minutes later, we get our food.  1 sushi roll, and I chicken wrap.  44 minutes.  NOT ONCE did the waitress come by to check on us.  No second drink, not sorry for the wait, not sign of her at all.  Food came, it was good, nothing worth the 44 minute wait.  Of course we were done eating prior to the waitress coming by to check on us.  So, I had my card ready, cause over an hour for a quick lunch simply did not fit into my schedule.  I wont be back.  There are way too many places in Scottsdale that provide good service and great food.  I was not expecting anything other than good food and average service.  AVERAGE service would have made this review 3 starts,. but I guess shame on me for just looking for average service in Scottsdale.",

I would take a coffee cup instead if it was clean! She finally took it from me and returned with a clean one hot from the dishwasher.  Overall, we had a good time - the drinks were good - the people-watching didn't fail . . . but I'm not in a hurry to return.

    "text": "Recently ate at Kona Grill and while it was good, I had a few gripes. We went around 1:30pm and the place was not crowded at all. There were more than plenty of servers/staff for the volume of customers.... yet our sushi still took almost an hour before arriving (maybe they were short in the kitchen?). To be fair, our server did apologize for the wait, but it was just odd that it took so long. The other gripe is possibly a violation of the Arizona smoking law. I know people are allowed to smoke outside as long as they are 20 feet from the restaurant entrance/door/ventilation system/etc, but we were sitting about 10 feet from the door and had a pair of girls sit next to us puffing cigarettes the entire time we were there. Of course we were seated one table away in the direction of airflow so the cigarettes might as well have been blown at our faces. One of them seemed to be friends with the bartender so that might be why they chose the seats they did. I feel as if the staff should have asked them to move to one of the many open tables, especially the ones that were 20+ feet from the door. Anyway, the food was delicious and definitely a place I would go to again for food, however, I would have to do so by eating inside :(",

I had about 20 minutes left and ordered as much as I can.  The lemon drop, which was recommended by the waitress was horrible. Tasted like 7up.  Potstickers: pan seared chicken, it was pretty good. I enjoyed it  Avocado egg rolls: i love avocado, so can't go wrong with this dish. However, I still think Cheesecake factory is better.  All their sushi rolls were below average, too much rice and not enough stuffing. Keep in mind, the rolls are pretty small. The combination sashimi was okay, the fishes weren't too fresh.   The California roll: very typical  Crab Crunch and Special roll. Both tasted the same. All I tasted was the artificial crab...  Spicy Tuna Roll: I can see the grading on the tuna was poor.",

    "text": "I'm not generally a fan of restaurants located within a mall, especially if it's a chain restaurant. I just don't care for the mall dining atmosphere. However, Kona Grill really surprised me! Especially the seafood. For a restaurant located in a mall... in Arizona... the seafood was awesome.  There are 3 important things you need to know about Kona Grill:  1. The Sea Bass is melt in your mouth, oh my god, foodgasm, amazing. Our waiter recommended it to us and I was highly skeptical. I thought that he was pushing this dish just because it's the most expensive one on the menu. Well, aside from the fact that it's the priciest item at a chain restaurant, it tastes more like a 5 star dish that would cost double the amount somewhere else. I'm telling you, YOU MUST TRY IT! It has this pan seared taste that is to die for. (I also can't forget to mention that the Salmon is super tasty as well).  2. The Cool Cucumber Mojito is not only refreshing and delicious, but it is also less than 100 calories! It's pretty strong too. This drink is pure heaven for a mojito lover like me, and it gets extra bonus points since its low calorie!    3. Happy hour!!! It's the best and it's always packed. Kona Grill has great deals with always changing specials (I suggest checking their website before heading over).  Just try at least one of these 3 things and you'll see why I'm such a fan of this place. Overall, when it comes to dining at Fashion Square Mall, Kona Grill is pretty impressive.",

When the kitchen is having trouble getting the right dish out/ ingredients on the right dish there are professional ways of handling it that don't make it to the diners.  Yeah that inspires a lot of confidence.   Avocado egg rolls were great even though 2/3rd of the ingredients the sun-dried tomatoes  and onions were scarce or so finely chopped as to be a homeopathic dose.  Pad thai was underwhelming and not much of a difference between ready made stuff from the store.   Name annoyed me  as anything I'd expect to find in a restaurant named after an area would be some of the foods from that area! It's  American food in the worst sense  Big Island meat loaf?  Oh just  die already.",

So I ordered some sushi and a drink and then tried to order dessert but they did not have the cappuccino mouse cake. Again this was my whole purpose of coming. I even told my server I will be ordering it before I even placed my food order. I was very dissatisfied with this.

We shared some cheese and bacon fries. I ordered chicken pesto pasta and she ordered a club sandwich. A friend met up with us while we were having lunch and they gave him a huge slice of red velvet cake for his birthday! Friendly service and great food. What more can you ask for?

(I've never tried inside, since all we ever expected was to drink a couple beers, eat a couple rolls and pass time... ohh and occasionally watch Suns kick a** ... ;)  )  ... so coming back to the point, the best thing that this place offers is Happy Hour ! ... And people have to realize that there are some places that you SHOULD NOT go during regular hours... and this is one of those places... I don't remember paying more than 15 bucks ever for a 2-3 beers and a lot of sushi... and that's cheap considering we ate a loot of sushi... and the best this they have on happy hour menu is Sweet and Spicy Shrimp ! ... that's by far one of the best Shrimp recipes I have tried... but again, 5 stars are not for food or drinks...   So... if you want to watch Suns play, eat some good sushi with decent selection of beer, not bother about crappy service or the kind of service that bothers you with your check 25 seconds after you gulp last sip of your beer... or just to sit out in beautiful non-summer weather of Arizona (after 9pm ie :D ) and pass time with your friends, this place comes highly recommended by me !",

The ambience was nice and I noticed they had a good happy hour.  But when it came to getting the check, we each had to ask for our own.  I do appreciate that they were able to slit a check for the size of group there were, but thought it was odd how the checks would randomly come in doses.  All in all I will probably go back when I'm feeling like typical chain sushi. :)",

Super awkward, I felt like our backs would be touching all night (I might as well join the group...ha).  Looking around I noticed a ton of other 4 tops and politely asked if we could sit at a table with a bit more space between chairs...duh.  I pointed at a table against the wall.  I got a nonverbal pause, and followed her back to the hostess stand while my group stayed standing.  At the hostess stand I was barely acknowledged and now felt like I was a giant burden.  A table number was mumbled between the two gals and I obediently followed the hostess. With at least five four tops in the main room, we were put by the railing...which is pretty much IN THE MALL...not my lovely table by the wall IN THE RESTAURANT.  There is also a mall exit door nearby and we ate our dinner with mall patrons rushing by us, pretty much freezing to death.  Guess I pissed someone off?  I honestly don't know.  Food was ok.  Waitress was sweet.",

If I could eat these everyday, I would but that is not going to happen.  Kona not only has fresh sushi rolls, nice variety there, but they offer American cuisine as well.   Happy hour is pretty bomb at this place.  Like most reviews, menu is higher priced so if you're not going during HH just be prepared.  Menu has a good variety.  Fish tanks add a nice feel but would appreciate a little more vibe to escape from \"everyday dining\".",

The girls who Kona Grill have as the hostess seemed very snoody and seemed bothered that you interrupted their conversation so that you could sit down and eat at the restaurant that employs them. Other than that the dinner was exceptional; edamame with angry sauce, a house salad, macadamia nut chicken, and a refreshing seasonal Sam Adams. The waitress was very kind and provided help for my wife in describing a few of the things on the menu. Also, if you split the chicken dish be sure to order the house salad with the dish and an additional house salad. We simply ordered 2 house salads which are $5.75 each instead of one with the meal at $4 and the additional one would have been $5.75. Other than that it was a wonderful experience.",

But then we literally never saw him again. He forgot my salad. My veggie roll had no asparagus in it. We had a buy one get one entree that we never got to use because we never got a chance to see him to even ask about it. Had to ask the servers standing around for pretty much anything we needed, including refills. My veggie roll was on the bill twice. The food was good... I wish I got the salad I ordered though... the Moscow mules were disgusting. And the service was horrible. Thought third time would be the charm.",

Everything was great except the margarita wasn't phenomenal I've had better also the dipping sauce for the calamari isn't that great either. Everything was great. I've also had their shrimp pad Thai in the past and I am a huge fan of that it's pretty amazing In my opinion.

I particularly enjoyed the fish tank. The service was very good, but then again we came in at 3pm on a Monday, so that was expected (but still appriciated!). I have celiac's disease, so I am quite used to having a limited selection, but dang this was pushing it. Two sushi options can be made gluten free. Two. That's not an extremely large selection! I saw that California rolls were not gluten free, which suprized me immensly. I asked about it, and they confirmed what was on the menu. Okay, whatever. What about tamago/egg cakes? Those are pretty standard. Nope. Our server has never heard of them. I ordered avocado rolls and yellowish rolls, thinking that it would suffice. The portions were insanely small!!!!! I finished the meal in under two minutes, and i am not exactly the fastest eater. My mother gave me some of her chicken and rice. It was pretty good. I ordered some fries, which were amazing. Still, I am starving and 20 dollars poorer. Given the choice i would not return. Would give no stars, but my sibling and parents enjoyed their meal, so I'll give you the benefit of the doubt. Thank you!",

The portion size of the chicken and shrimp lettuce wraps are awesome and very tasty. The drink specials for happy hour aren't as good of a deal imo but still not too bad. It was very crowded and service was average. I would go back in a heartbeat though because the food is delicious!",

Our edamame was covered in salt, to the point I had to wipe it off on a napkin before eating it. The drinks were so bad that I had to chug mine like a shot. Our usual cheap Houston happy roll now became a $12 roll yet had less than half the amount of tuna on it? Our plate had an entire corner broken off of it, literally an inch broken off the plate, which in my opinion is super tacky to serve to a guest. Needless to say, we won't be returning.",

The remodel was highly anticipated and we traipsed through mall looking forward to seeing the brilliance. We immediately loved the blue tints and amazing fish tank, then on our way to the bar I tripped up the stairs. Clutzy me? Nope, there was some unfinished remodeling and something wasn't to code so well it wasn't just me but even after the manager apologized ever so kindly nothing was comped and I had a horrible bruise for more than three weeks -- I couldn't sit in chairs with arms or sleep on my right side.  But....we love Kona, so back we are today and it's crazy holiday madness and the stairs are fixed with a safer ramp thing, but....the bathroom seemed like 89 degrees hot and sopping wet and in disarray, the downstairs dining room was stuffy and smelly and bright as a cafeteria. And once safely upstairs the bartenders were flustered (but we do like Brett and have enjoyed his service a lot!!) and where oh where are the TVs? It is a tied game ...Cardinals are standing strong and I have to depend on the Yard House for yelling out updates. Not cool!!!  Get it together Kona! We miss the old Kona but of course we aren't the same people either...just call me Mrs Z now;)",

They have some  gluten free options but they list it on a separate menu with no pricing so matching things up is a bit of a pain. Just putting a gluten-free symbol next to options on the regular menu would make things easier. They do have gluten-free soy sauce for sushi and sashimi which is nice. Lots of food options from burgers to salads to sushi and sashimi so it is a good place to come to if there are people in the group who do not like raw seafood. Having lived in Hawaii for over a decade I am not sure where the Kona theme comes in as there is little Hawaiian about the place. That said the restaurant is nice though and the water tank behind the sushi/sashimi chefs adds to the atmosphere.",

The bar is semi-dark with a good number of people (took us awhile to find a table). The \"Happy Hour Specials\" was what got my attention.  We ordered a variety of appetizers from sweet & sour chicken, sushi, dumplings, and 1/2 priced margaritas! I absolutely LOVED this place!   It's a great place to take a break after shopping. My regular margarita on the rocks probably did some good deed after an exhausting day of shopping.",

During our meal we decided that we should leave quickly, not because of the service, but becuase there was an employee (probably off the clock) sitting at the table next to us smoking. The smoke was blowing right into my face and as a non-smoker, I could not stand it.",

It comes with this slightly spicy/sweet dipping sauce that is to DIE for!   Secondly, I highly recommend the Sweet Chili Salmon Salad as well.  It comes with a huge fried wonton shell and is tossed with a soy-miso dressing.  My mouth is watering just thinking about it!   And finally, happy hour at Kona is really great.  They have great HH specials and great apps! Both Konas in Chandler and Scottsdale also have a fun outside patio area that is really popular every day of the week! Make sure to get there early if you want a table!  It's also a great place to start a fun day of shopping at Fashion Square ;).",

    "text": "I almost saw my first bar brawl ever last night. Ever.   It was really exciting watching an almost altercation.   I was sitting with eight of my workmates eating dinner. (I had an overly dressed salmon salad. The salmon was tasty, but there was too, too much dressing on the greens and the tofu was so plain and white. Ick. It should be against the law to serve tofu plain and white. It perpetuates tofu's bad reputation.)  I was chatting with my boss and a colleague about megapixels and such when there was some shouting at the bar and a patron was being steered out of the restaurant by a fancy-looking man that I identified as the manager. More shouting and we were like, \"Oh! What's going to happen now? Where's mall security?\" Then the patron came back! He grabbed the wrist of the girl that he came with and pulled her out the door. How embarrassing. I would have been like, \"Get off of me you bleep bleep.\" But she just walked out with him. I hope that she's okay.   Then there was more shouting out in the hallway of the mall and we were all waiting for mall security to bust through the doors and lay down some mall law.   But nothing happened. We went back to eating over done pad thai and over dressed salad.   A moment passed and then the manager came over to our table and apologized for the ruckus. Wasn't that nice of him? He had done his best to get boozer out of the restaurant and then he apologized for boozer.   Four stars for the classy manager.   The food is bleh.",

And like many observations confirm....the appeal of the basement dwelling, exhaust fume-smelling, valet-adjacent eatery escapes me as well - but I keep on going.  The truth is - the singles scene, convenience, taste and value of a Kona Grill happy hour has many people coming back as well.  I was just there on a Monday night - and couldn't believe how busy it was.  And considering the number of reviews this place has is another case in point.   The sushi rolls (california, crab and tuna) are surprisingly good - not amazingly good, but more like \"wow...I can't believe this is $2 sort of good.\"  A friend I usually go with is a calamari junkie - and always orders her own.  I guess it's that good.   I usually get the Maui wraps (i think that's what it's called) with your choice of either halibut or chicken in some kind of slaw - it's great.     Service leaves a bit to be desired.  It's usually pretty bad either because they are so slammed, or because we have some stuck-up blondie broad pissed that she actually has to lift a finger.  Either way it's still a good deal to check out, and I'll be going back again.",

I'm highly allergic to fish, so I understand the risk in going somewhere that 1/2 the menu revolves around fish. However, when I order something made out of, oh... beef, then I expect them to use proper food handling procedures to avoid cross contamination.  And yet, there I was, 1/2 through my sandwich, throwing up to beat the band in the bathroom stall.   I guess this isn't a point that the local Departments of Health like to stress. However, this is also the sort of thing that can very easily kill someone. Fish, peanut, and other allergies of the like are the kinds that can end someone quicker than a bullet.   Won't be going back there, no matter how much the GF needs a sushi fix.",

Menu has a wide range of options, from sushi to pizza and full chicken/seafood entrees, so it's easy to please a larger group of people.  Convenient location and just easy.  Cons:  while the mall location provides lot's of people and action to watch, you can't help but feel a little Velveeta enjoying cocktails so close to a Discovery Channel Store.

Yes, of course we have had vodka tonics before and know what they taste like.  The tonic was either flat, cheap, or something different altogether.
