It's right in the heart of old town so after I grab my juice I like to sit outside on their patio or walk around old town for a bit before starting my day.   If you haven't tried this place give it a shot you will not be disappointed.",

The staff are extra friendly and make for a pleasant experience. I loved the freshly squeezed orange juice, though over priced. Folks seems to like their fresh juices. I had the egg +sweet potato hash, which consisted of cubed sweet potato and small bits of spinach and two over easy eggs on top. All freshly made but very little flavor and nothing to write home about. Maybe less potato and more spinach would have made for a more balanced dish. Yes. Give them a try. They're worth it.",

They certainly did not skimp on the hummus - it actually took a lot of restraint not to try to drink the overflow with a straw. I cannot overstate how amazing that hummus was.  The menu has a wide variety of salads, sandwiches, and bowls, with many vegetarian options. The veggie items are substantial and filling (think hearty grains and beans, not just a bunch of lettuce and tomato). The place is pretty tiny and parking can be difficult but once you get a parking spot and a table it's time to leave all your worries behind and enjoy a meal that will leave you satisfied and feeling great about your healthy choices.",

I arrived 30 minutes prior to hair appointment and figured I'd have enough time to place my order and still make it to the salon which was just down the street.  Boy was I wrong!   There wasn't a line when I walked in.  It was a pretty laid back Saturday morning as I placed my order.  However as I sat on the bench waiting for my name to be called, large groups of people started to pile in,  At first I thought an event must be going on in Old Town Scottsdale, but it just turned out to be that time of the morning where everyone was ready to get their day started. I ended up being late to my hair appointment :(  My breakfast sandwich took way too long to make.  People who came after me were already receiving their protein bowls and began chowing down, and I sat there twiddling my thumbs (un)patiently waiting.   The food overall was good, but I just wish it didn't take so long.  40 minutes to get a breakfast sandwich to go is not how I wanted to start my Saturday morning.",

Their protein bowls are to die for and big enough to make a second meal of.   They have freshly brewed flavored iced teas such as blackberry, jasmine strawberry or peach and black watermelon.  They have delicious and fresh ingredients in all of their meals and their open kitchen gives it a homey warm feel. The juices are delicious my favorite is the liver cleanse. They also have fresh squeezed lemonade.  Healthy fresh ingredients that taste so good you feel like your cheating on your diet...but I assure you you aren't :)",

So hella busy and hectic and tumblr-y. I had to wait in a line for 10 min which wasn't horrible, only one person was working the cashier until I got the front of the line.  I ordered the Asian salad with tofu. Salad also took about 10 min... A whole crowd of people were waiting for pick up in a small area and I felt kinda smashed in.   As for the salad it was pretty good, nothing mind blowing but good. The vegetables seemed pretty fresh and the tofu had not a lot of flavor. They leave the dressing on the side which i actually really like, no one likes a soggy salad Ironically I poured too much dressing... (I was in the car it was a struggle) honestly probably much better without any dressing tbh but still good.  Definitely wanna be back to try the juices or smoothie bowls! Maybe when I have a lot of time for lunch or dinner.",

They have salads, sandwiches, \"protein bowls\", breakfast, parfaits, juices, coffee, puppies, and interpretive dancing. Alright, maybe they don't have the last two (unless you bring your own puppy) but it was a lot to think about.   I settled on a dutch salad with a side of sweet potato hash and quinoa. The salad was perfectly dressed, with plenty of Gorgonzola, pear, dates, and leafy greens. Likewise the quinoa was a great addition. It was lemony, with crunchy snap peas. The sweet potato hash could have used an extra jolt of flavor but it was nothing that salt couldn't fix.  The service was iffy because they messed up our order. But they were swamped so I understand.  If you sit outside beware of the mister that's used to cool people off! It surprised us and I felt like me and my meal were produce at the grocery store.",

So I made a date with my wifey to try this place out and we were not disappointed.  As I am in the middle of 30 days vegan, I went with the Tofu w/green curry protein plate.  They call it a plate, but its served in a bowl... In the bottom of the bowl, there are roasted veggies consisting of carrots, cauliflower, broccoli and onions.  Along with the veggies, you get a choice of forbidden rice, brown rice, quinoa or sweet potato hash.  I went with the SP hash since I'd already had rice that day. On top of your grain/hash choice and veggies comes the tofu and green curry sauce.  Amazing flavors.  The curry has just a little heat, but the sweetness from the roasted veggies is a perfect compliment.  My wifey had the shrimp protein plate option with the forbidden rice and gave it rave reviews.  There was so much food neither of us finished our portions (we tried!) We left very full and for about $8 total.  I have already notified the bf that we'll be back.",

They then jip me on the amount of chicken they gave me and replaced it with a ton of veggies. I love veggies don't get me wrong but when you literally can count the DRY small pieces of chicken on one hand then we have a problem. In conclusion, the service was horrible (they didn't give me my bowl for free or half off or free drink or anything, instead I have to wait longer to get jipped on the bowl I ORIGINALLY ordered), the chicken was dry as the Arizona heat, and the bowl had maybe 9 pieces of chicken.

My boyfriend and I came here for breakfast before heading back on our road trip  to our home state. We came around 10:30 AM on a Sunday morning and it was relatively empty and easy to find parking. I ordered a traditional acai bowl and cucumber pressed juice while he had a yam, egg, and wheat tortilla plate.   Overall thoughts - I had a few samples of his plate and it was a solid 3 out of 5. There was flavor lacking and although the food tasted fresh, it wasn't particularly finish your plate delicious.  As for my juice, it was the same - about average and and my acai bowl deserved a 2/5 rating. Instead of agave I would really have preferred organic honey instead as the acai they had here was not sweet enough to stand on its own and there was far too much granola in mine and the banana was too soft. I still am heavily biased in thinking Orange County and Los Angeles have the BEST acai bowls in the country.   Although prices are pretty average and the decor is cute, I don't think I'd want to come back whenever we make it back out here.",

    "text": "UPDATED REVIEW!!!! So, after my initial review, once at the office, realized they got the order WRONG too  So needless to say, I was pretty furious and decided to call their manager after my meeting.   I talked to Bailey that was beyond appreciative that I called to let him know what happened. I told him given the nature of my business, if any of my team conducted themselves like this, I'd want to know. He agreed wholeheartedly. Asked me what we ordered and asked me my name and issued me a $50 gift card that's waiting for me at the register.   I so, so appreciate Baileys attention to detail and with no hesitation righting this wrong. Although I can't get a new 1st impression, I will give them, a 2nd try...and adding a couple of stars back for all his efforts   So tried this place for a work meeting from a colleagues suggestion. Called at 9:30 am for an 11 am pick up of 5 protein bowls....nothing that should be too overwhelming with 1 1/2 hrs notice.  At 11:20 am, inquired as to what the hold up was, to which the guy never even came back to let me know...tell me they messed up...SOMETHING!  So at 11:35 another guy asked me what I was waiting on. He walked in and back out of kitchen area and started talking to someone else without yet again...not a word back to me.  FINALLY food came out...no sorry, here's  a coupon or something for your trouble. Now I'm already 20 mins late to my meeting.  Was excited about this place, after perusing the menu...no 2nd chances on a first impression  2 stars as place was clean and cool hip decor.",

We've been eating out a little more than we'd like to as of late as we recently relocated to the area for a few months. This place was perfect when we were looking for a healthier guilt-free option.  I got the green curry tofu protein bowl and my SO got the kale caeser salad with chicken. They were both light meals that didn't make us feel heavy afterwards, a rare experience for a meal out. However, a couple hours later, we were getting hungry again, gah. Regardless, we'd rather feel better about ourselves and our choices when it comes to food rather than overly stuffed and uncomfortable after eating god knows what at some other place.

The sweet potato hash is a close second. Zen bowl, awesome! Protein bowls, ditto. Fresh squeezed juices, perfectly refreshing for a hot, desert day. The salads are always fresh and full of flavor. Do yourself a favor and check it out! Fast, casual dining with tables outside in Old Town Scottsdale for people watching and enjoying a great meal!",

This eatery is both coffee shop and cafe. It offers a delicious and efficient selection of food that you can either eat there or take with you. My two favorites (so far) are the turkey sandwich and kale cesar with chicken. Both are fresh, relatively nutritious and certainly fill me up.   The atmosphere here is that of a earthy coffee shop and has both an outdoor and indoor seating area. You order the food at the counter and then take your seat. It still has a little feel of the old cheesesteak place, but much more trendy and healthy!   This has quickly become my go-to spot for a quick and healthy lunch option and I will soon come back to try their breakfast, coffee and dinner!",

I love the humus and veggie sandwich - really tasty, genuinely healthy, and it comes with a side of kale salad.  I also like to order a side of sweet potato hash - delicious, but a little heavier.    The protein bowls and breakfasts are quite good, too, and the hearty scones make a wonderful quick meal.  The other night, one of the lovely employees, Colt, introduced me to my new favorite thing: the veggie sadwich, served as a wrap, with shrimp - dee-licious!!!  I checked and they're happy to make this modified item any time!  I can't wait to have it again!!  One more tip: try the Stevia Lemondade - so yummy!!  This is such a treat because I love lemonade, but I'm usually put off by the amount of sugar required to make it tasty.  **After tons of wonderful visits, great service and delicious food, I'm bumping them up to 5 stars!**",

Maybe it was just 'cause everyone hyped it up so much that I wasn't that impressed...   I will definitely give it another shot though, because I like the concept and eating healthy. Maybe my tastebuds didn't like the choices I made that day? Who knows... Nevertheless, I will be back :)",

Beverages they offer include a large list of seasonal lemonades and fresh squeezed fruit and veggie juices. I decided to try something new and ordered a fresh squeezed Cold Buster (oranges, carrots, and ginger)... it was great!! They also have a good sized menu consisting of salads and sandwiches and everything sound so good to try!!  I got the American salad with added shrimp, which was packed full of bacon, egg, corn chips (aka fritos), and so much shrimp for an extra $3, I basically got a shrimp salad!  The food is very reasonably priced with most items ranging in the $7- $10 range.   The ChopShop decor has a country chic vibe and is a fun and lively place to grab a bite.  You can take your orders to-go, dine inside or out.  The staff was super nice and welcoming and I can't wait to try more items from this great new spot in Scottsdale!",

My kale salads both came out with way more romaine than kale (not great since romaine isn't even listed as an ingredient on the kale and quinoa salad).   More problematic - both times they messed up my order. The first time my salad came out with no dressing. They offered to remake it, but it was annoying since I'd already waited a while for the food.  They're usually busy- I get it. I don't mind a wait, but do mind a second wait because of their mistake. Today the salad came out with no chicken, which is a substantial up charge. Again, we had to wait for them to remake it. Both times my husband was done with his meal before I got mine. Today, they also forgot our juices, so we had to ask for those near the end of our meal. Overall, two disappointing experiences. Our money is clearly better spent elsewhere.",

It seems like this place is trying to promote a healthy concept, especially with its whole wheat tortillas and selection of fresh juices.  There are plenty of these types of places in San Francisco and I'm guessing this place has four stars because there aren't many similar places in the area.  Don't get me wrong, I love healthy, whole foods, but that doesn't mean there needs to be a lack of flavor.  A common stereotype of healthy food is that it is bland, and this places definitely feeds into that stereotype.  I ordered the eggs + veggies hash and the bf ordered the sunrise wrap - both needed to be doused with hot sauce.  Overall, decent quick, healthy food place, but don't expect to be blown away.",

I took a friend for her first time and I am going to guess she will be returning frequently. Great spot as always!",

    "text": "Visited this new spot very recently and I was less then impressed with their establishment and service as a whole.  The smoothies that they made were okay in taste but not worth the money they charged for it.  The service was relatively inconsistent as far as when the food, apps, drinks came out to my table.    As far as specifics on food goes, they were pretty stingy when it came down to dressings and sauces and did not serve nearly enough with my meal.  Furthermore the actual plates (if you can call them that) that we were served in were of really poor quality which I did not like at all.  Lastly as a bigger guy I need larger portions and Chop Shop definitely does not have that. The portions were way too small and did not fill me or my friends up at all.  Not great by any means.",

That way if you came here for lunch while at work you wouldn't feel pressed for time.  A lot of offering for any type of eater, meat eater, vegetarian, vegan and gluten-free. I always appreciate seeing a place that takes all of the different types of diets into consideration.   I also love a place that serves kombucha on tap. I went with one of the kombuchas they had on tap that day. There were also bottled kombuchas, juices, waters, etc.   I went with one of their salads on the menu and loved it. I really wish I remember which salad I did order but nonetheless, it was super tasty!  There are places to sit inside and outside with small tables, big tables, and community tables.   Keep up the great work!",

I had the open faced breakfast sandwich which was delicious. Whole grain bread with ham, arugula, avocado and cheese and topped with two eggs. My husband had the breakfast scramble which was veggie hash with two eggs on top served with a whole wheat tortilla. The hash was basically inedible. The pieces of sweet potato were raw and made up 90% of the bowl. The other veggies were barely there.  He didn't want to go through the hassle of sending it back so he shared my entree and the acai bowl.  They need to cook their hash, not just toss raw veggies together and warm them.",

When that day inevitably arises, ChopShop always makes the top of my list.   Their menu is great in its flexibility. If you want something light, their chop salads are crisp and appropriately dressed in a way that is flavorful without being weighed down. My personal favorite is the raw vegetable. If you're looking for something more substantial, you can go with a protein bowl, sandwich, or get any of the chop salads as a wrap. The juices are also incredibly refreshing on a warm day, especially the slim squeeze and cool down. Plus, if you're wanting a break from all of the other typical old town brunch offerings, they serve their breakfast menu significantly later than most places. This location can definitely see a lot of traffic as most places do in the area, but they seem to have a good system that keeps lines moving.   Next time your body is begging you for relief from recent diet choices, look no further than ChopShop.",

Unfortunately I've worked many places where the nearest lunch spots were all fast food or unhealthy restaurants like Olive Garden, so the fact that I can go to ChopShop and get a fast, healthy and tasty meal is great!  Now honestly, I am not a huge fan of rice bowls, which is why its great that they have the option of having bowls served over diced sweet potatoes. But whether you're having a bowl, a salad, or a sandwich you are going to get fresh, tasty ingredients that will leave you satisfied. Oh, and the lemonade is excellent and the smoothies are delicious as well.  Yes, sometimes its tough to find a seat inside, so just go out and enjoy the patio and the people watching as you wait for your food to be ready.  Original ChopShop is definitely where it's at!",

This location is awesome, they're always quick even during the busy lunch rush and are also easily accessible on postmates if you don't have time to go into the restaurant. I also like their protein shakes after a workout, the Beach Burn Shake is a current favorite of mine. I also love their Chia Pudding cups which make for a great sweet treat/dessert. Their protein bowls are also delicious and depending on how hungry I am, I can get 2 meals out of one bowl!",

B L A N D - Couldn't believe how underwhelming the flavor was in the green curry tofu bowl. Didn't seem like any of the vegetables were seasoned, and the tofu was especially bland.  I felt like the menu was also really lacking. It was kind of a cluster and didn't seem organized very well... Also, they only have one vegan salad dressing.  I wouldn't be opposed to trying one of their acai bowls or protein shakes, but not sure about the rest of the menu.  \\_()_/ ",

My boyfriend and I enjoyed the toffee cookie first, and instantly wanted more! After, I had the grinder on a gluten free wrap, which tasted very good and had just the right amount of sauce on it. My boyfriend has the spicy Korean bowl. Luckily, he gave me a bite before devouring it as it was just that delicious! We will definitely be back to try some more of the delectable entrees they have to offer.",

We were a little confused because my sister wanted the teriyaki chicken bowl, but online it was not on the \"dairy free\" list. But the lady working behind the counter said that she didn't think it had dairy. Also my mom wanted to get the sweet potato hash, but they couldn't tell her in person if the hash was not gluten free or not. After telling the cashier that she has celiacs and cannot have gluten at all, the cashier asked if she wanted a sandwich with their ciabatta bread. I don't think the cashier understood what gluten was. I just feel like at a restaurant like this, the staff would be very aware of if items have dairy or gluten or not. But otherwise, we all enjoyed our food. I got a veggie hummus sandwich and it was delicious, kinda overflowing with hummus, but that's how I like it ha.",

They delivered my food to me and I asked where my smoothie was and they told me it was at the counter. Once I found it, it was melted and watery. A little instruction on how their delivery process worked would've been appreciated.  But the food was good--I had a breakfast wrap and the sweet potato hash and both hit the spot.

My first time there, I ordered a fresh juice & a salad. Guy gives me a number for my order & no further information. I look around for a table, but every empty table is completely dirty. I go ask someone behind the counter, if they can clean a table. Guy says yes, & never comes.   I then sit for a while at one of the dirty tables, then a couple leaves & leaves a fairly clean table, so I move to that table. About 20 minutes after I ordered, I was still surrounded by dirty tables & they brought my salad. I asked where my juice was, & he said it was by name. Huh? I don't work there, it's my first time there, & apparently there's 1 system to get your drink, & one to get your food. This is obviously something that should have been explained to me.  By the time I got my juice, it had been sitting around for a long time & had separated. The service sucked & I was really disgusted by how dirty this place was.  If they can improve their service & hygiene, then I'll be happy to give them my business. This is something that management or the health department really needs to address right away.",

Everything about the food is perfect, however the service at this location can be improved. They are always punctual and get our orders right, but I gave them 4 stars because the attitudes of the cashiers aren't the best. For being the face of the restaurant they give off a pretty unwelcoming vibe (we've had this experience multiple times at this location). The irony is the servers are always so much nicer than the cashiers!! I think next time we might just take the extra 5 minutes to drive down to the Tempe location where everyone is so sweet! Nonetheless, you really can't go wrong coming here for breakfast, lunch, or just a nice snack! Their lemonade never disappoints (especially the seasonal ones) and their coffees are also so good!!",

The juices were fresh but also so filling. Quite frankly, I thought the prices here were fair for the portions!  The ambiance is rustic-chic..with an open/spacious feel. Good for a casual breakfast/lunch or snack any time of day! One really feels healthy but satisfied dining here. Highly recommended!",

I love that they have a serious side availability of sriracha for my Asian taste. Besides, you can wash everything down with a side of fresh lemonade with stevia. But caution, walking out of this place is a pretty penny. What is your health worth to you?  The patio seating is great for people watching and there's plenty of seats as this place never seems to have a down time. I don't know what they put in their food but it always attracts the best eye candy available from your hipster to your beefcakes and hotties with the bodies.

Let me start by saying, these portions are NUTS! I have to say, I'm not a huge eater but when I'm hungry I can eat! I finished maybe...1/4 of my entire meal and left more than full! I loved the flavor of the bowl but would have loved a little more of the yummy teriyaki sauce! I also would have loved the brussels sprouts to have been more crispy but the meal was great overall! I also LOVED that there was an option to get some of my favorite kombucha drinks. :D I think they should add Kombucha on tap to their menu. ;) I saw many people getting fresh pressed juice and smoothies and I can't wait to come back to try one! Every meal that came out looked phenomenal! We were so happy with our choice of Original ChopShop!",

    "text": "The ChopShop is by far one of my favorite dining establishments in the valley. They offer healthy and high quality food, with a pretty wide variety of options that range from healthy green juices, protein shakes, salads, sandwiches and protein plates! The atmosphere here really reminds me of Urth Cafe in Los Angeles, it's a really organic, earthy coffee shop feeling with both indoor and outdoor seating options. It can get pretty slammed during lunch hours so if your strapped for time I would recommend calling in and order ahead of time!   A few of my fav items here are the Kale Cesar Salad, The Tri Tip and the Shrimp protein Plate, both plates are served with their super healthy and might I add yummy black forbidden rice and a generous helping of roasted broccoli, cauliflower, carrots, onions and mushrooms. I was really impressed with the quality of the steak and shrimp that they have and honestly the size of the shrimp they serve. Juice wise I love their Power Green Juice which has Kale, cucumber, celery, apple, ginger, parsley and lemon.   When I am in the area and looking for a healthy and quick lunch option this is my go to spot!",

In the meantime I have been told by my doctors to stop going to the gym/working out until I can raise the money and get the surgery that I need. Now that I cannot be physically active I am in fear of gaining weight! I looked all over for a healthy spot I can start going to that juices. To my surprise I found this cute little place and it is RIGHT by my house! For the past few weeks now I have been visiting the Chop Shop on average of 4 mornings a week. I have been getting the pressed juices in efforts to stay healthy and feel good.  I have been pleasantly surprised to find a green juice that actually tastes good!!! They are amazing!! The juices are all delicious and easy to drink since the texture is smooth and thin not clumpy.  My favorites thus far are the Kale Cleanse and the Power Green. YUM! I have also been trying the food seeing as how its all very healthy! The Beet Salad is fantastic and it is a large portion for the price.  The Sunrise Wrap is also a great breakfast choice and you can even order it with a gluten free wrap instead. I am just in love with this place and will be continuing to go as much as I can and even after my surgery. I am so happy that I finally found a place that juices!!",

My newest obsession is the Chicken Protein Plate, which is packed with diced chicken, veggies and Forbidden rice, all covered in a delicious Thai Peanut sauce. The Forbidden rice is a black rice definitely tastes different than traditional white rice. Don't let it scare you off though, it really makes the dish not only interesting to look at but full of flavor. If you aren't in daring mood, you can substitute the forbidden rice for white/brown rice or sweet potato hash. In addition to the protein plate, I also recommend their homemade lemonades. They change them up by the season and last time I was there it was watermelon lemonade, but unfortunately, they were sold out, so I \"built my own\" juice with carrots, cucumbers and apple, and was very pleased. If you haven't tried ChopShop yet, I highly recommend it.",

My sandwich consisted of thin bread (almost pita-like), with a generous helping of hummus, some perfectly cooked mixed veggies, lettuce, and olive tapenade.  There was also a small lightly dressed side salad.  Everything was delicious!  I would definitely try this place again if I am in the area.",

I love the bowls and the juices - proof that it is possible to have healthy, flavorful and well priced food.

Everything here can be a bit costly especially if your just out on your lunch break. Parking sucks. The outdoor area is nice except for people walking through on the sidewalk.

I've been back twice now with friends and my parents and there is definitely a reason behind it's success. Simple dishes, good quality and great tasting food. I have ordered the protein plate, love the thai coconut sauce and have tasted the Asian chop salad and Grilled tri-tip. Only complaints I could make is that my friend who had the sandwich found that early on in her meal the bread is rather thin and tends to soak up the oils and juices (more so than in a regular sandwich). Changing the bread to something sturdier would be a good solution. And it's not often that I say this but it would be great if the Old Town location was a bit bigger. Not a lot of seating room and they could easily expand I think. Great decor however and as the weather cools down the patio is still a good option when it gets busy. Definitely recommend going there.",

We ordered protein bowls both with brown rice and the rice was just one big clump of overcooked mush, gross. Also there were hardly any veggies and tofu, not like the other times we ordered the same dishes! That's not a great experience, but, what bothers me the most is the fact that the girl behind the counter couldn't care less about my complaints and she had the most annoying look on her face it was incredible!! She didn't try at all to make it any better, all she did was handing me a side of sauce straight from the fridge for my hot/warm dish to put on and let me know that there is usually no sauce in the dish except a little on the tofu! I am in the hospitality myself and I know that not everything can always be perfect but if its not than you have to at least try to make it right for your customers! Also, place had a ton of dirty tables and though there were like 3 people behind the counter and no other customers beside us, the tables did not get cleaned in the 30 minutes we were there ! Very disappointing",

You would think that in a town where everyone strives to be so aesthetically pleasing, that there would be more convenient healthy restaurants, but, alas, there are not.  Subway just doesn't do it for me, so I was so excited when I discovered this place.  I always get carry-out, so I can't speak too much to the service, but the cashiers have always been friendly, my orders have always been correct, and they have always been ready on time.  My favorite thing is the chicken protein bowl with the forbidden rice--delicious!  It has wonderful Thai flavors and is very filling.  I also love their raw vegetable salad.  Everything in it is very fresh, and there is a good ratio of lettuce to veggies.  I add chicken.  The dressings definitely taste too good to be healthy, so I usually use a little of their dressing and a little of mine at home that I know is lower fat/calories.  But sometimes I just don't worry about it because that raspberry vinaigrette is gooooooood!  I've also had a couple of the sandwiches and the sweet potato hash, both of which were quite tasty.  I will definitely keep going back!",

    "text": "I guess the fact that I have been here 3 times already and I just arrived in Scottdale should tell you something.  I took an early flight out from the northeast and was wanting to explore a bit so I decided to check out this place that the hotel staff recommended for dinner.  And while I was checking it out I decided to get a juice.  The juice was so good.  They have 16 ounce and 32 ounce and I thought there was no way I'd be able to drink a 32 ounce juice but my juice went down sooo well.  I got the Roots and Fruits.  It was sooo good.  Then my coworker and I decided to meet up for dinner.  Since I'd already been here I was okay checking something else out but was so happy she was game to try.  I got the Tofu Protein bowl with forbidden rice.  But I was intrigued by the sweet potato hash so decided to ge a side of that.  So glad I did - the sweet potato hash was amazing.  The rice was good too, but I more sweet potatoes got eaten.    A couple pros and cons:  Pros: 1) fresh whole food meals & juices 2) crazy fast service 3) super nice employees 4) in a really cute area 5) prices seem really reasonable (but keep in mind I'm from the east coast)  Cons 1) they add ice to the juice (not a lot, but I'd rather have all juice) 2) juice is served in a plastic cup.  Not a big deal but I'd rather they put it in a bottle so it would stay fresh longer and that would also make it more portable for me to carry several back to my hotel room.  I'd definitely recommend to anyone in the area who is looking for whole foods, fresh juice and good vegetarian options.   They are NOT a vegetarian place - there are plenty of meat options, but it's nice having lots of veggie options as well.",

Ugh, love it! They also sell juices for a reasonable price (ie less than $6 instead of $10 I'm looking at you pressed)  Also, their protein bowls come with BLACK RICE! If you haven't tried this antioxidant filled behemoth yet, run to ChopShop right now. More substantial and slightly nuttier than white rice, black rice is also slow digesting and so delicious! Black is back, betches.  Also, all of their sides are amazing. The sweet potato, kale hash is wonderful, the mixed greens come with the really good dressing, and they are all under $3!  I've gotten their salad before and my only qualm is that they're a little too small, protein bowls all the way!! The chicken bowl comes with cilantro, crushed peanuts, and a coconut curry sauce; people with diet restrictions rejoice bc they are super happy to customize! Protein bowls run from $7-$11.  Best of all, this location in particular is super good for people watching. Come at peak hours and you'll see all the quintessential Scottsdale things we've come to know...and love?

    "text": "I wanted to love this place but frankly, my first experience there was a big ole \"meh\".   I have to say, we went on Memorial Day and Old Town was pretty much a Ghost Town. Thus, Chop Shop was NOT BUSY. And definitely not busy enough to have me wait 20+ minutes for a damn salad that had no cooked ingredients to justify the wait.   I ordered the Danish salad. The menu says it's chock full of goodies like arugula, greens, almonds, pears, apples, dried currants and dates...when it arrived it had a ton of greens, almonds, and dates but only two slivers of pear and three skinny slivers of apple. Basically I was expecting some robust fruit chunks and Chop Shop wasn't down with the program.  So in conclusion: boring salad and terribly slow service...not enthused about the possibility of coming back here but perhaps it's worth a second try some other day.",

Their protein shakes are amazing tasting, I am sure they are fifty gazillion calories, but seriously delicious! I got the pina-kale-ada and everything about it is extremely tasty. I also like that they serve sandwiches, wraps and bowls.   I am excited to go back, if I can, to try out their bowls because they have brown rice and quinoa based bowls with grilled chicken, shrimp, beef, etc. Sounds delish!!

When you travel a lot and notice that half of America is still trapped in the fast food world, it makes you appreciate Scottsdale (and California!) that much more. When it's busy service can be painfully slow, so I suggest calling in an order for takeout even if you plan on dining in. This is my biggest issue from time to time.   My go to is typically one of their bowls but I have tried about 1/2 the menu. The Thai coconut chicken bowl and the green curry tofu bowls are my top 2.  You can do half sweet potatoes and half rice to mix things up in your bowl. For breakfast the egg + veggie hash is outstanding.   Next time you are craving that gut bomb carcinogenic italian sub, skip it and go to Chopshop!",

I came here twice in a day, once for breakfast after hot yoga, and once for dinner after another hot yoga session (ok, the yoga here is really good!)   I got an acai bowl in the morning which was pretty big for the price. I opted out of agave nectar on top and it was already plenty sweet. It was okay, but I could taste a lot of apple juice in there, so it was definitely more watered down with more added sugar than I would have liked.  For dinner, I got the chili lime shrimp bowl with forbidden rice. Really great portion of veggies and shrimp! The rice was a bit hard. I also got some of the banana bread, which is definitively not one of the healthy options, but SO moist and delicious.   Next time, I'll try out one of their protein shakes or juices, which also looked yummy!",

With so many options and flavor profiles (not to mention all pretty darn healthy), it's easy to want to go over and over again.   The menu features sandwiches, salads, protein bowls, shakes, juices, acai bowls, and the like. On my most recent visit, I opted for the teriyaki chicken protein bowl which comes with avocado, brussels sprouts and sesame seeds, atop your choice of brown rice, sweet potato hash, forbidden rice, or quinoa. I went for brown rice but immediately regretted not getting forbidden rice when I saw the other bowls. Once it arrived, I doused it with some Sriracha for an extra kick. It was super filling and tasty! From salads to sandwiches, everyone seemed to enjoy what they ordered.  Everything comes out pretty fast and it's definitely adequately priced, with most main dishes ranging from $7-$12. There's ample seating both inside and out, and the food is brought to you via a number system when it's ready.  Overall, I look forward to going back the next time I'm in town! Wouldn't be upset if they opened a Miami location either...",

I also loved the salty crunch of the pistachios. I also added shrimp on top, which was a delish addition. All the veggies tasted fresh, minus the tomatoes. But those are fruit anyways, right? Haha. The dressing was just okay. I feel like I make better vinaigrettes at home, without the punch of sweetness.   ChopShop is a fast/casual concept. You order from the menu, sit down, and they'll bring you your food. Which such a vast menu of options and ability to customize, I would have liked the opportunity to sit and look at the options a little more--especially for the first time.

I ordered a juice as well which was delicious.   Unfortunately after I got home I realized they gave me 5 cashew cookies with chocolate chips instead of 5 Paleo peanut butter cookies.

The dog was on a leash but not a short one and they allowed the dog to sniff around, wondering freely and toward our table.  I mentioned this to cashier when we went back in for the shake, and was taken a back when they rudely, in my opinion, said, \"that is not our problem.\"  Perhaps they were correct, but it would have been better to tell me something more comforting or reassuring.

We stumbled across it on our first day in Scottsdale, while waiting to check into the W hotel. The salads there are generous & delish! The Danish salad with steak was my favorite, I had it twice while there! I loved that everything was consistently proportioned, so I had little bites of every ingredient, down to the bottom of the bowl. We also went there for breakfast & the breakfast egg bowls are just as good. They have smoothies too, which I loved stopping for after my run on the Scottsdale river path. They are sustainably minded, use healthy ingredients, and recyclable or compostable products & the prices were very reasonable. In summary, we ate there every day we were in Scottsdale, for at least 1 meal or snack. Great, healthy bang for your buck.",

After complaining multiple times the manger took a very laid back approach. He said oh there are a whole bunch of orders back there. This manager was just awful and shouldn't be in such a position.

It is well known in my office that I love this place as I'm always picking up breakfast and lunch there and suggesting it to everyone! My favorite thing to get for lunch is the American salad with Shrimp (I get it without corn chips and cheese) and then I sub the thousand island for red wine vinaigrette. YUM. It's a pretty big salad, and the shrimp are so so good. I also love their Jasmine Strawberry iced tea. Actually pretty much everything I've tried there has been great. For breakfast I like to get the Balanced Bowl with chicken and then sub rice for more veggies. I tried the cheat day wrap one weekend based on the recommendation from one of the people who works there and that was bomb too. Kale cleanse is good, so is the Jacked up PB& J. It literally tastes like PB&J ice cream d-lish. I like sitting outside here and it's great that they now have a separate line for phone orders/take out orders because the line gets CRAY. If you go in there around noon plan on being in line for a good 20 mins (aka I would call ahead if you're on a time crunch). I get it though, it's delicious.",

I may be biased toward this place because they accommodated my celiac needs so well, but I know that the menu (breakfast included) is versatile enough for everyone from vegans to ravenous carnivores...and seriously, I can't exaggerate how tasty it all is! I can only speak for the food, though - I regretfully never ended up trying any of the juices or shakes.

    "text": "Good concept, but poor execution. Coming from California,  I was very excited to find a healthy restaurant in Scottsdale. I feel like the flavors and combinations were good ideas, but unfortunately they fell short of my expectations. They said that the teriyaki chicken bowl was their signature, so I got it with forbidden rice. The teriyaki chicken was a bit dry, and had almost no flavor, I had to add salt and Siracha. They also only gave us five little cubes of avocado on top. I also got a chicken prosciutto wrap. However half of the wrap had no prosciutto, and they forgot the fig sauce. To give them credit, they remade it when I went back.   I also got an acai bowl. It was very small and icy instead of smooth (often they pre-blend the acai in the morning so it's not freshly made). Again, I had high hopes but was disappointed. I wish that they had taken a little bit more pride in the execution of the dishes. Hope they improve!!!",

However, they do have outdoor seating for those days that aren't terribly hot or even for a meal after the sun goes down. I had the chicken and prosciutto sandwich which was pretty good, but the protein bowls are where it's at! My friends got the teriyaki bowl and that was phenomenal. I'm excited to come back here and try everything! Highly recommend!",

And it makes me want to sell my clothes to be able to afford it.   I've purchased the following:  -Grilled Shrimp with Wild Rice -American Salad (I believe it's called) with red wine vinaigrette instead of thousand island -Club Sandwich (it came with a side of mixed greens and that same vinaigrette)  Each one of them have blown my mind, but that salad was by far one of the best things I've ever had. The shrimp was perfectly juicy.   The only complaint I have is that my Perrier was warm and there was no bottle opener for me to open it with. I had to wait for the guy to become free again to get it open. But I don't care because the food is just that outrageously delicious.",

    "text": "Continuously saw posts and pics of ChopShop and finally gave them a try for lunch while in Old Town.   I took it upon myself to take recommendations from a friend and got the Thai Chicken bowl with Forbidden Rice and the Tropicale juice. The food came out in a reasonable amount of time and is served in a pay-and-food-will-be-brought-out-to-your-number style.  The rice bowl itself was okay, pieces of chicken flavored with coconut, sauteed veggies and Forbidden Rice (Black/Purple Rice) which I typically see in Korean cuisine. In terms of flavor, there wasn't much that was savory. It was more on the sweet side and definitely had more veggies than protein. Portion is a bit on the smaller side. As for the Tropicale juice, it contains: watermelon, pineapple, apple, lime and ginger. The juice was pretty good it was sweet and fruity with a slight kick from the ginger. It's way cheaper than the juices at Whole Foods and costs $5.75 for a 16 oz cup.  All in all, the food is just okay. Kind of bland tasting, though the juice I thought was pretty good. Perhaps I'll try their wraps or a salad next time around. Plus the cost for a rice bowl and the juice came out to be around $18, which I think is a bit excessive for a small bowl of food that lacks in the flavor department.  This location is pretty cute, however, welcoming me back to try their other items! During lunch, it was pretty crowded and managed to snag one of the few tables open.",

I haven't tried their breakfast items or juices, I've only tried the teriyaki chicken bowl and the shrimp bowl. Both are so damn good! Definitely a great option for lunch or a weeknight dinner if you're too tired to cook when you get off work!",

I understand that they get busy but when you are waiting 20+ mins for 1 protein shake that's a little ridiculous. Also it would be as long as a wait if the staff were actually being productive. As I waited for my drink there was about 6 employees behind the counter just chatting away and laughing. Its a little frustrating when one of them is the person making your drink and they weren't doing anything but talking and then as 20 mins go by you realize there is a drink ticket and it took him not even 2 mins to make it.... Just seems like every time I come here this is an issue.",

Was in line for 5-10 minutes behind two ladies who were there together, when the first was ready to order one of the employees said he couldn't take her order because she cut everyone in line? That makes no sense considering she had been in line for quite some time. I had to step in at that point. It just blew my mind that he was standing behind the counter and didn't see her for the few minutes her and her friend were standing there? It seems very rude and unprofessional for my taste. Employees should always be aware of customers, especially as soon as they enter the establishment. Overpriced, tasteless and will not be going back again.",

I'm sure you can understand that coordinating that many lunch orders can be a little crazy. We then placed a second call with some changes. The gentleman who took down the changes was short and abrupt. We come to find that one of our orders wasn't correct and although it was taken off our bill, that second point of contact was not a great experience. We appreciate that this location gets incredibly busy during lunch time, due to its location, but I'm not sure taking out frustrations on customers is the way to handle it.",

The greens mixed with things like corn, avocado, even pistachio nuts are simply the peak of salad ingenuity. Ok maybe not that extreme but wow is it great. Makes for a healthy and delicious meal every time.  And the smoothies are badass too.

    "text": "Original Chop Shop Co...thank you so much for being within walking distance of my workplace. Because of you, I'm not forced to settle for generic drinks and preserved, processed foods.   I'm a creature of habit and it's slow for me to branch out into other things, so I frequent my faves in the Chop Shop menu. One of those faves is the Tropicale Pressed Juice. Oh my gosh it's good! It's so refreshing and it feels like I'm doing myself good when I drink it. My other favorite is the protein bowl with tri-tip and forbidden rice. I really should learn to portion control when I have the Tropicale and the Protein Bowl.   I liken the Chop Shop environment to be California, trendy. There's seating both inside & outside. The 5th Ave, Scottsdale location is in Old Town, so it's a great location if you like being around a lot of activity.",

The \"protein bowls\" are all delicious; Brown or forbidden rice (black rice) with grilled veggies and meat or tofu.  My ONLY complaint...is that the protein bowls are frequently cold by the time they arrive at the table. Which is a huge bummer, because they're delicious otherwise.",

Recommend the kale and chicken wrap as an entree and a pressed juice. (Roots and Fruits or Liver Cleanse are both winners). These made to order juices are fresh and actually cheaper in price than neighboring bottled juice establishments (Nektar, etc.).   The Old Town location recently expanded and took over neighboring retail space. Big improvement as this place can get very busy during key hours.",

The salad had pears, dates, blue cheese and greens and just enough dressing.  I was glad to see they don't drench the salads.  I dislike it when they overload them with dressing.  The sandwich was delicious and creamy too.  My hubby noticed the protein bowls and they looked very enticing.  Next time.",

This meal has a teriyaki sauce flavor to it without the awful syrup like teriyaki sauce you get at most generic places. It was minimal and just enough! For those of you who dislike onions, make sure you ask to have those removed.   Service is always great whether I'm getting something to-go or enjoying some air on the patio. Check it out.",

    "text": "I'm so very disappointed in this place. Up until a month ago, it was the healthiest place in town and being Vegan it had some great options for me as well as awesome juices. I go about 2x per week and always send people and friends there from out of town or have business meetings for lunch. For the past few months I've been having the HARDEST time ordering my burrito from them. I don't eat meat or eggs so I order the ingredients I will eat. For some reason, it's way too much for the staff to handle writing down 5 ingredients and figuring out how to enter them into the computer. Each call takes at least ten minutes and two times ago it was such a nightmare I had to get a manager of the phone. Two days ago was the last straw for me- the girl couldn't grasp that I didn't want eggs or dead pigs in my burrito and that I wanted to substitute tofu and brown rice. She was so incredibly rude to me I have no idea how she could be in the restaurant business. The guy who came to the phone took my order correctly, but very unapologetically. It's not rocket science to figure out a process to modify orders or tell your staff if there are special requests, take out a pen and paper and write the order down, then thank the customer, let them off the phone and get some assistance to enter the order. I've decided to take my business next door to Farm and Craft where the vibe is awesome and the staff is on point! Chop Shop has gone down hill BIG TIME and it's a shame especially with direct competition next door you should be stepping it up. I was spending at least $50/ week here so you know, not to mention sharing my horrible experience with all my friends- that's lost business and rather unfortunate. Best of luck with some training and better hiring decisions.",

I was astonished to find out that even tho I wanted only one tea bag and asked for a larger cup I would be charged for the hot water $3 as opposed to a small cup of water $2. This is more than anywhere else as most restaurants provide continuous hot water and Starbucks will give you two tea bags with a large cup.   Food is great but don't get teas!!",

The first time I went I wasn't very hungry and was hoping for a yummy juice or smoothie. I do like how they offer cold pressed juices and am looking forward to trying one someday. I picked a fruity smoothie I believe called the Beach Burn. It was alright, but absolutely not worth $6.  On my next visit I popped in for a quick bite before work. They delivered my girl friend's sandwich significantly before mine even though I ordered first, which was annoying but not the end of the world. I had the chicken and prosciutto sandwich and my friend had the club. Both were good, just nothing to write home about in my opinion.   I'll probably give Chop Shop one last try to find something I really like because as I mentioned it's not too pricey and within walking distance of my work.",

The menu here screams healthy with a wide array of healthy salads and well conceived healthy dishes.  The staff is pretty well oiled and jams it out! You will not wait long. I like to sit at the tables on the eastside offer a great view of the main drag ; people watching here is a must! You will see every $2 dollar millionaire. They put everything they have into their car in hopes of meeting the right group. Pathetic people! Just get after it and lead your own charge.  Anyway after you get done eating healthy, you can go and wreck yourself with the multitude of bars to puke outside of. However, because you had your protein, you will recover better than most.  #irishcatv2 #Vino2 #Vinosquared #Vino2ultimate #rebelfoodandwine",

Female staff will be cutting fruits/veggies with their hair in front with no regard to putting it behind their shoulders. Gross. This is a restaurant. Please put your hair back.   The past three times here they have messed up my order. Asked for extra mushroom, decided to put none. NONE. Got the BBQ Chicken wrap, decided to put normal corn when the menu plainly says corn nuts (which is the best part with the sauce). A heads up would've been nice.   You pay too much for this restaurant to be lazy and careless with their orders. I hope this review helps management figure out the issue because it hasn't been this way until recently.",

My quick three day visit resulted in a delicious breakfast and lunch here. The breakfast visit included an affordable and tasty slice of avocado toast topped with an over easy egg for $5 followed by the colorful pitaya bowl topped with shredded coconut for $7. And, because I couldn't resist a smoothie, I opted for the peanut butter protein with added kale (quite large given the price point). On both occasions the staff was very friendly and helpful in navigating the menu.   During my quick lunch visit I ordered the green tofu curry bowl with brown rice (the bowl is loaded with vegetables). I'll be thinking about this bowl for weeks. The menu is extremely veggie and vegan friendly and the restaurant offers both indoor and outdoor seating. If you're craving coffee, they offer Stumptown along with a variety of teas and kombuchas. Now, if only I could transplant this business to Indianapolis...",

I even was here with a bigger group (about 12 of us) and they were able to get us all fed quickly and on our way.  I ordered one of the protein bowls. For these, you get to choose brown rice, sweet potato hash, forbidden rice, or quinoa as your base and all of them come with broccoli, cauliflower, onion, carrot, and mushroom. Then you pick your style. I went with a spicy Korean steak that was really enjoyable, but there are also chicken, shrimp, and tofu choices. Beyond the bowls they have sandwiches and salads so there should be something for anyone in your lunch group no matter how diverse the tastebuds are.   While I was here just for lunch I also saw that ChopShop offers breakfast and fresh juices too if you are looking for that instead. I'd definitely head back this way for that or anyother lunch if I find myself in the area!",

There's plenty of bowls, salads, sandwiches, acai bowls and conscious choice snacks.

I loved that they had lemonades and iced teas of the day... a perfect refreshing kick to a hot Arizona day! I wish I had room for one of their fresh pressed juices, as I'd love to see how they compare with the many varieties I have to choose from back home in LA. Best of all, the prices are really reasonable ($5-6 for juices that would cost $8-9 easily at some of the more high end spots in LA), and the salad came in at about $10 with the shrimp addition.   The place was crowded at lunchtime, but we were still able to find a table for two pretty easily, and the line moved very quickly thanks to efficient and friendly service behind the counter. I can count myself as a huge fan of this place, and hope it makes its way to California!",

The best combination ever! I started my meal off with the thai chicken protein bowl.  Each protein bowl is served with roasted broccoli, cauliflower, onion, carrot, and mushrooms.  You can also chose from brown rice, sweet potato hash, forbidden rice, or quinoa!  I chose the sweet potato hash.  Conceptually, everything worked with this bowl.  Flavor was also on point!  The downside was my sweet potato was a little undercooked and had a crunch when I bit into it.  I wasn't really a fan of that.  The mixed veggies were cooked perfectly however they were slightly cold.  I'm wondering if they had an older batch and used the extras for my bowl?  I don't know how you can just cook veggies and have them taste like room temperature?  Next was the acai bowl.  You all now how passionate I am about acai!  Lol. Well it was as expected.  Nothing fancy and nothing different about it... It's a basic acai bowl with granola, bananas, strawberries, agave, and coconut shreds.  Needless to say the craving was satiafied.  I would honestly give this place a 3.5 fo their food.  However, the place was clean, had a nice vibe, and the front cashier named sofie was really helpful!  Customer service from her was a 5!  Thus, my rating of 4 stars on yelp.  I'll be back again.",

We need a place like ChopShop (original chopshop, not chopshop teriyaki), and you will do so well here because we have the most Crossfit gyms in America, most superficial people and most people that work out and want to live and eat healthy.   By the name of this place, it's super deceiving. ChopShop? When I pulled it up on Yelp, I thought it was a steak place and overlooked it the first day. Then there weren't much in the area, so I pulled it up and went through pictures and noticed that it was healthy eating. I was stoked!!! I recently jumped on the band wagon to exercising and healthy eating. I had to try this before we left...I mainly was eyeing the shrimp protein bowl. And I finally got the shrimp protein bowl with the Green Glory juice. The green glory juice is nothing new- I usually make this at home and it still very tasty. The shrimp protein bowl on the other hand was SOOOO GOOD! I can't fathom how much I craved this right now... yumm, yet so simple to make. I got it with forbidden rice/black rice...all the juices at the bottom and the fresh veggies mixed in a bowl...it was the best healthy thing I had in a long time. My friend also got the breakfast burrito \"cheat day wrap\" which looks like a burrito and which turned out to be the best healthy breakfast burrito I've tried, it felt clean..and not greasy, unlike all the burritos here in SD (they all come with a shit ton of fries or potatoes...) We ate the wrap on our car ride back to SD probably 2-3 hours later and it was still the best shit ever. The acai bowl was good too, but it melted a little too fast, maybe because of external temperature, but it had a great amount of fruit and toppings.   I regretted not taking a bowl to go... I wanted to try their tri-tip or chicken...now I'm mad at myself for not taking advantage of this place... Oh also btw, everybody who came in here either came from the gym (all in work out gear) or you can tell they work out (muscles, fitness, etc). Love it.",

The ingredients are all healthy, raw, and fresh. My favorite dishes and recommendations are: the raw vegetable chop and pitaya bowl. I was not crazy about the loaded PB&J smoothie--I would recommend a different one.   PROS:   -Food & drink: healthy, fresh, fast service, variety of options, and efficient grab and go concept.  -Prices: reasonable and worth the bill.   -Atmosphere: hip, modern, bright, natural, and casual. There is an outdoor patio with faux grass patches and an indoor dining area decorated with mirrors, flowers, and colored chairs--providing a sense of crisp and calm.   -Service: friendly and young. Not much interaction with servers other than ordering at the counter.   CONS:   -It can get extremely busy during prime eating hours. Be aware there will be noise, crowds, and a longer wait.   -Outdoor patio has been dirty a few of my visits.",

After several lunches brought into the office for me and now one actual visit where I dined in, I can proudly say that OCSC is a new favorite and will definitely be thrown into the regular rotation moving forward.    I've had their chopped vegetable salad, grinder sandwich, kale caesar salad, and Arnold Palmer and I've enjoyed it all... It's so nice to have a place with so many healthy options nearby.  I also love the fast casual concept (where you order at the counter and they bring your food out to you when it's ready).    Word to the wise: it gets crowded during the lunch hour, but it's worth the wait for sure... especially if you're craving something healthy and filling.  And while the line may appear long, it goes fast.  There is plenty of indoor and outdoor seating as well.  Nice to have options!  Employees are friendly and prices are reasonable.  Looking forward to future visits!",

It's inexpensive to eat here I think nearly everything on the menu is less than $10.00.  I had the Protein Bowl with Chicken and did the $1.00 extra for Quinoa. I liked that they stir in fresh vegetables like broccoli, cauliflower and carrots but honest this bowl really reminded me of a frozen dinner. The textures and taste of the chicken and vegetables were similar to those frozen TV dinners. I would not order this dish again. It was edible and seemed healthy but I didn't enjoy the taste of it.  My husband had the grilled tri-tip sandwich. It was filled up with nice looking mushrooms and just a sprinkling of chewy morsels of beef. The fresh baked bun was gluten free and baked in house. He said it tasted good but for him was lacking on the protein too much.  I noticed most people were ordering breakfast items so that might be the popular choice when dining here.",

I myself do a lot of juicing at home so trying the different combination they use in their drinks has inspired me to try new recipes! They also have great salad options and protein plates to choose from. When I'm on the go this is my go to spot for quick and healthy eats!  I happen to love their Kale Salad  and Shrimp Protein Plate. I often call 20min ahead of time to place my order and take my food to go. This place is always busy and especially during lunch hours and on the weekends. The staff is very knowledgable about what they offer on the menu and they can help make suggestions if you get stuck on what to choose.

I drank a quarter of it and threw it out. Partly this is my fault because I don't drink dairy milk and I forgot to ask for almond or soy, but my smoothie was supposed to have chocolate, milk, banana, whey protein, and peanut butter. I could not taste any peanut butter and it was really watery, nothing really too it. Just ewwwwwww. Also, for a place with great vegan options they should have a protein other then whey available. The smoothie tasted like plastic butt (yes i said plastic butt) and took forever, but giving 3 stars because I like the concept and menu in general, also late hours which are great. Will not return for a smoothie or when in even the slightest rush. Also I find no bathroom for customers? Weird. Also everyone working there except the nice guy at the register seemed to be very unhappy to be there. Will give it another try and hope the food is better then drinks and service is friendlier.",

I've had most of the menu and the bowls more often than not are my go to favorite. The Danish salad is awesome but if you get it for take out make sure you don't use the entire dressing because it will be so soggy. The Asian Salad was so bland. We just had the hummus sandwich as a wrap and it was honestly kind of gross. It came out as literally a giant mush of hummus with almost no veggies. They remedied the situation with another side of veggies and wrap. Guess i'll stick to the bowls but it seems to be a trend lately that ChopShop quality is going downhill. Maybe the competition is getting to them or they are just being complacent..",

Took the kids here for Acai and Pitaya Bowls on our last family trip in April and they loved it so much that the first thing out of their mouth each morning was 'when are we going to ChopShop!?'",

The restaurant was fairly busy when we went, but we didn't have to wait to put in our order. The guy behind the counter was friendly and seemed to know about the restaurant's product. I ordered the tri tip sandwich and the husband had the turkey club, which were reasonably priced for under 10$ each. They have the fast casual model in which you order at the counter and take a number to your table where your food is delivered a few minutes later. We sat in one of their (somewhat awkward) booths that are very close together with other tables and booths. The decor of the restaurant is cute, but they definitely appeal to a certain crowd (particularly men wearing tank tops.... I've never seen so many men wearing tank tops in one place in my life, and I've been to Miami). Our food arrived after a short wait and it was alright. My sandwich was fairly tasty, though the meat was a little chewy. The husband's sandwich was fair, just a run of the mill club. The salads served with the sandwiches were bland and tasted like they hadn't been dressed, but the vegetables were fresh. Overall, it was ok, but I wouldn't run back here again.",

    "text": "First off I just want to say that Chop Shop used to be my absolute favorite. However, since the change of ownership I would not recommend it to anyone. The last three time I have ordered take out they have always gotten my order wrong and I am charged for the full order. I usually order multiple meals to save for the next day since I work a lot. I have lost a lot of money recently since I have been charged for an incorrect order. This last time literally half my salad was wrong and the lettuce was completely wilted to the point of not being able to eat the salad. I specifically asked the girls checking me out if everything was correct and when I ordered on the phone I asked the to repeat my order twice because it had been wrong before. I should have double checked before I got to Chop Shop but I was in a rush and by the time I got home Chop Shop had already closed. I am so disappointed with the changes they have made and am extremely disappointed in the management.",

It was delicious and I didn't even need to use the extra sauce they sent along with my order.  The vegetables were cooked perfectly and the rice was yum too.  I liked that there were more vegetables and meat than rice.  Definitely would eat here again and would be interested in trying their salads and sandwiches.  Thanks for the delicious reprieve from a humdrum lunch at work!",

I would like the lunch portions to be a bit bigger and an option to order a larger juice. I tried ordering my juice without ice one time because they fill up the entire cup full of ice, but they just gave me less juice. It does take a while for the juices to be made as well, which always seems weird for a simple process. It seems like they're trying to manage their costs with the portions and the staff doesn't seem too motivated to get orders out quickly. They don't seem to be too concerned with customer satisfaction.  The food and juices are excellent. Very healthy, organic, and local. Very simple menu, but great options to choose from. Breakfast and lunch are both excellent, and the cold pressed juices are good for both or a good snack.  I have become a regular at this place because it's the perfect mix between healthy, taste, local, and variety.",

It's hard to find healthier places to eat so chop shop is good to have in your back pocket. My only complaint/beef is it's sort of expensive for what it is but I worth it. You just couldn't eat here every day because you spend restaurant prices rather than take-out ones. I also love their patio (note- dogs are allowed!).

I work in the service industry so I know that a smile and   bit of patience can go a long way! They also make everything to order so obviously it's gonna take a few minutes so if u are so worried about time then go somewhere else or you can always call the order in to go so they can make it without you breathing down their necks :) all in all I will keep going here because it's delicious, reasonably priced, friendly and right next to my gym!",

This usually means that a restaurant is accommodating. Unless they mean when you order we will cook it. Which is not the same thing. I have allergies as does my daughter and this place was by far the most unaccommodating I have ever been to. Everything is pre prepared so NOTHING can be altered or removed and everything is marinated in oh so unhealthy soy. So even if you wrap it in a gf wrap, hey guess what it's not gluten free. We were there at 2:30, well past lunch time and service was really slow and the prices are sky high. Don't waste your time. Nothing about this place is cooked to order. Chipotles is more cooked to order than this place. Cheaper, faster and really allergy friendly.",

I liked the healthy options but after tasting the food that was esthetically pleasing everything fell apart. This is the type of restaurant that makes people believe that healthy food cannot taste good. If your only concerned about the environment where you eat and not flavors, I'd suggest this place to you.",

I failed to read carefully that the forbidden rice is standard.  I kindly apologized for not requesting brown rice and asked for a new one.  The employees told me NO, that per management they are not to redo a rice bowl without charging me the cost of a new one.  At 36 years old, I have never experienced a restaurant not catering to the customer's request for a change, never mind a small fast food like place.  The fact they stated it was the managements rule was beyond me.  Needless to say, I won't be dining here anymore.",

I had their fruit cactus tea and it was authoring lay very good.

All its goodness was enveloped in a large pita flatbread type.  It's fairly large, so I think it's shareable.  And, worth the $8 price tag.

    "text": "A group of my coworkers and I went here about a month ago and I loved their food.  Their pressed juice Kale Cleanse was so good I could have drank it all day every day, it was addictive good.  And their sandwiches were huge so I was able to eat half for lunch and the other half for dinner making it completely worth the price.  The only things I didn't like was there is no where to park, that's a plus for them because that means they are busy but a negative for me and my coworkers because it means the place isn't really meant for takeout.  So when you're doing a lunch run and it's your turn to pick up, it really sucks trying to carry 6 drinks and tons of food to your car parked far away.  And they don't have an easy carrying box for multiple drinks either. I had to stop every 50 feet to adjust my grip so that I wouldn't spill the drinks.  I also wished they delivered.  Sometimes all of my coworkers want to order about $60-$100 worth of food, if not a larger order at times.  But we just can't break away from our work stations.  The food is delicious but we just can run and get it.  I bet if they set up delivery within a small area to cover the businesses near buy, they'd be picking up $1000's more in revenue per a week if not a day.  Like I said, my coworkers and I can easily bring up a hefty each run.  But what can you do, maybe one day in the future things will change and they'll have delivery.  In the mean time, the lack of delivery will not stop me from eating there whenever I can.",

I saw that there was a pick up order ready on the counter behind him but then he then just ignored me and started doing something else so I figured mine wasn't ready. So then I sat down on the bench right by the registers to wait. While I waited the employees were behind the counter cleaning up and literally talking crap about another employee non stop...

    "text": "This might just be the next popular fast casual chain. For now, you can find it in one location in posh Scottsdale where you are expected to look like you've been deep fried in oil.  The outside design is lovely, making it feel like an old timely market. The inside design is a bit cramped and confusing; leaving you just to want to leave and eat your food elsewhere. After negotiating the odd interior, you can count on some healthy food options that are actually very tasty, unlike most health foods. I went with the Tri-Tip steak wrap which was one of the most delicious sandwich based delivery systems I have enjoyed in quite a while.   All of this enjoyment for under $15. Frankly, instead of a steak on a plate for $50, I'll take my steak based wrap transportation system anytime. Well done!",

While not a juicer, I have tasted several of their juice options and they are delish and fresh!   I would strongly and highly suggest you visit the Original ChopShop for a bite to eat.

    "text": "One of my favorite healthy spots in Old Town Scottsdale. This was actually the first eatery I went to when I first moved down to Scottsdale and was healthily pleased!  Juices:  I used to have a juicer back in my hometown, and would juice all the time. It made me happy to come here and see all the same ingredients I used to put in my juices, especially my favorite one- the Cold Buster made with carrots, apples, ginger, and turmeric.   Smoothies: They have a variety of smoothies and the one that intrigued me the most was the PBJ Smoothie. So tasty and has a touch of peanut butter along with fruits. It tastes just like a PBJ sandwich!  Protein Bowls:  The protein bowls are great as well. My favorite is the CHILI SHRIMP BOWL. What impressed me by ChopShop is that when I requested for something that was Whole30 compliant, they knew what exactly I was looking for and replaced the rice for salad and put the dressing on the side. So if I ever want to do Whole30 again, I know where to go for healthy, delicious meals!  Service: If you're going to go on a lunch break, make sure to order beforehand, because the lunch rush is heavy and it takes a while for your meal to come out, regardless of whether you're taking it to-go or eating there.

If i'm going in the morning - I always get an Acai bowl, however, this past weekend I tried their PITAYA bowl and OH MY GOODNESS, not only is it beautiful (a hot pink color) but it is so flavorful (a tiny bit tart which I love) and delicious. I love that they put kiwi on top. This will be my new go-to! If you're Acai obsessed like me, give this bowl a shot, it may just be your new favorite! OR I get a juice - all of them are fab, you can't go wrong!  For lunch, I ALWAYS get the kale caesar with chicken. I love that they put tomatoes in it and the dressing is really healthy and yummy.

Truth is, I rarely eat red meat. Which is likely why I'm anemic, so when I saw this little shop of salads my heart skipped a beat.   The menu was small but adequate. Overwhelming menus are so passe. Keep it simple is the way to go - and they use that motto in more than just their menu. Their ingredients are simple too. Actual healthy raw fruit and veggies. Natural goodness that you don't have to worry about. Real food. Vegan choices. Gluten free choices. All the foods for all the peoples!  I immediately ordered up a meaty bowl of spicy Korean steak (hey, I needed the meat!). The brown rice v forbidden rice was a choice I failed on. Always go with forbidden.

    "text": "I'm pretty sure I'm not the only one who looked at a restaurant titled Original ChopShop (OCS) and thought, \"I've never heard of that steakhouse\".  Upon further investigation, I set the record straight (the \"chops\" are actually a reference to the salads here FYI).  OCS is instead a fast growing AZ chain of restaurants focused on mostly health conscious dishes and drinks at affordable prices.  Ryan and Caitlin Jocque opened their original location in 2013 and there are now 5 valley locations as of me writing this (with 4 more in the works).  After studying their menu I decided to make a go of their Old Town Scottsdale location for an early Sunday morning breakfast.  Located on the northwest corner of 5th Avenue and Scottsdale Road, Original ChopShop occupies a prominent spot in Scottsdale's Old Town dining and retail district.  But don't let the prestige of its location fool you.  The interior is as unassuming and welcoming as a corner neighborhood cafe.  If you can imagine a mashup of Scottsdale restaurants True Food Kitchen and D'Lite Healthy On The Go, that's basically what OCS looks and feels like (except without a drive thru).  The Old Town location seats pretty close to 100 including the outdoor patio area.  Order up front here and the food and beverage are brought to your table.  As I was one of their first customers on Sunday, the process was basically a cinch.  The lunch menu is OCS' main claim to fame here, but I decided to dabble in the breakfast menu in part because of some items that intrigued me from the outset.  For one, their Jacked Up PB & J protein shake looked very interesting.  Strawberry, banana, peanut butter, whey powder, non fat milk, strawberry syrup, and agave nectar.  I also wanted to grab one of their fruit bowls so I asked for their Acai Bowl (pronounced ah-sigh-ee).  Acai palm mixed with apple juice, banana, a mixture of berries, granola, shredded coconut and agave nectar.  Lastly, I was craving something a little hearty so their Cheat Day Wrap looked like just the fix.  Scrambled egg, bacon, cheddar cheese, avocado, tomato, turkey and brown rice stuffed inside a whole wheat wrap.  Total cost for the food, protein shake and tax came to about $21.  Food came out to me in just under five minutes. The protein shake was great and thankfully not as thick as I was thinking it would be.  A smooth slightly fruity beverage with plenty of the peanut butter and jelly notes they advertise.  The Acai bowl was also delicious, though I will say I felt the acai plum perhaps was a little too dominant in this dish.  Would've preferred a slightly more of an even mix of fruits and more granola to boot.  As for the wrap, I was mostly happy with this as well.  I feel like the brown rice was a little unnecessary and threw off the texture a bit, but everything else in this wrap gets a big thumbs up from me.    All in all a pretty flavorful (and mostly healthy) start to my Sunday.  Next time I'm here (or another one of their locations) I'll likely delve into their protein bowls or sandwiches.  But its safe to say that OCS' growing popularity is no accident.  And with the population becoming increasingly health and wallet conscious, we're likely to see many more of these types of concepts in the future.  Props to OCS for finding a way to marry healthy and affordable in a tasty fashion.  And in Scottsdale's most fashion conscious neighborhood no less.",

Working remotely out of a different office for a week, I was wanting to maintain my normal healthy eating habits but not have to pay tenfold for it. The love affair began as lunch option with a protein bowl, the chicken teriyaki. Great mix of vegetables, subbed for the sweet potato hash and the chicken was tasty. Then one evening wanting something light, I went with Kate + Quinoa salad which just hit the spot. Where they delivered the grand slam for me was with their breakfast - their Avocado Toast is simple, delicious and only five bucks (I'm used to SF prices where just toasting the bread seems to be a five dollar charge). The toast plus the Muscle Malt Protein Shake and I've got the complete package. I'm coming back.",

It's not a bad thing, since its obvious to me they are incredibly busy all.the.time. This is the only reason I don't give 5 stars but it certainly doesn't deter me from returning.

Upon entering the ChopShop on any particular evening, you'll find quite a few people still in their workout or yoga clothes. The atmosphere is pretty hip, but not stuffy at all.  The menu includes quite a few health conscious items including salads, protein shakes and acai bowls. OK, the last one is really a dessert disguised as a health food item, but I digress. The breakfast items look appealing, however I have not yet had the opportunity to try them.  Orders are placed at the front counter and the food is then brought to your table. The staff is very friendly and accommodating. I ordered the American salad with steak, but also had the chance to try the Kale Caesar salad with shrimp. On a previous visit, I had the BBQ Chicken salad. Each of which was done to near perfection. One of the largest issues with salads that come pre-dressed is when they come with too much or too little dressing. These fortunately were coated perfectly. The vegetables were fresh and crunchy and the flavors complemented each other perfectly.  The prices were very reasonable and the amount of food was to my liking. I highly recommend the ChopShop for a visit, whether coming back from a workout or just plain hungry!  [This review is based on my visit on August 14, 2013]",

The last time I ordered food I got the teriyaki protein bowl for my bf and the tofu one for myself - the cooked veggies were pretty awful and ruined the whole dish, just not very fresh and halfway between boiled and fried. Very mushy. My \"coconut milk\" sauce was pretty watery, too (maybe trying to cut the calorie count? I'm not sure), and there was about a Tablespoon of teriyaki sauce for the chicken bowl with extra protein - so he got to have a few pieces lightly coated.     At least it's better than the first time, when I asked for recommendations and the cashier told me \"he doesn't know, he doesn't work in a kitchen.\" ...okay...    But, the drinks are pretty good.",

They have plenty of options for food, especially if you follow a certain diet: they have gluten-free, vegan, and vegetarian options! All the ingredients are always fresh and ripe when making each dish.   One of my go-to bowls is the Thai Coconut Chicken because of its spicy and rich flavor. You can get it with brown rice, quinoa, or even sweet potato hash. If I'm wanting something sweet I typically go for the acai bowl (they can substitute regular granola for gluten-free) and I always have to get a lemonade to drink.   They are usually always busy but the service is pretty fast! The food always comes out hot and you know everything is fresh. It's a great place to get work done, hang out with friends, or have a date night at!",

A weird lady sitting two feet from me was staring akwardly at me.  Typical weird Scottsdale crowd.  But I liked the food, I had a turkey sandwich the fresh bread was the highlight.  A ginger strawberry lemonade was good too.  I will come back but hopefully when not so crowded.",

An absolute doll.   [Customer service is really big with me and if someone doesn't show stellar (or at least acceptable) customer service on my first encounter, chances are, I will not be back.]  This place exceeded expectations with the great customer service, positive attitudes and much needed recommendations. I ordered a nitro coffee, power green juice and zen bowl to go. I also ordered the avo beet toast for a coworker. All of the food was prepared quickly and full of flavor. The prices were fair and the food options were quite healthy.   Needless to say, I will be making this a weekly regimen as they offer healthy options for post workouts which are a great start to the day!!   Thank you for the spectacular customer service this morning and starting my day off even better than it was when I came in!",

Everything tasted fresh and great ! .....On our last morning in Scottsdale we decided to try cappuccinos here after a couple of below average experiences at a couple of other places.

It's great if you want to stop by after shopping or just grab some healthy foods or something to cool off with. The inside is well air-conditioned and there's very nice seating that would allow you to either do some work or just chat with friends.   I met up with two of my friends here and well got something from the Superfruit Bowls and Parfaits. I got the Pitaya Bowl and my two other friends got an Acai Bowl and Coconut Chia Pudding. We shared them all and I would say that these were all excellent and really hit the spot especially in the Arizonan summer heat.   The Pitaya and Acai Bowls was very sweet, having a good blend of crunch with the granola as well as the softness of the fruits. The Coconut Chia Pudding was little less sweet, but I only say that because I had the bowls before trying it.   Overall, this place has a wide selection of healthy meals and snacks and it's great for socializing or doing work at.",

I also tried a protein shake, Muscle Mass I think it was called, and it was pretty darn good! Not too sweet and didn't sit like a lead sinker like a lot of shakes do. It has a bit of a granola vibe, which is totally fine, except a little attention to table bussing between customers would make the experience a five star rating. I would recommend this place to anyone who cares what they eat and wants it delicious tasting, too.",

In fact, everything I have tried here has been great. Not only does everything taste amazing, I feel great after eating it.  My favorites here so far are the chicken protein bowl with quinoa, the tri-tip sandwich and the chicken and prosciutto sandwich. I was a bit worried about the sandwiches because of the whole wheat low-carb bread, but these did not have that cardboard taste that I have come to associate with low-carb. The bread seemed like a cross between a pita and wheat bread. They were nice and soft and the flavor was really good.  I have yet to try the salads or the breakfast, but I will get there. I have no doubt that they will be just as good as everything else so far.",

I give the place 3 stars, but gave an extra bump for being dog friendly and giving out dog biscuits.    The only part that could use improving would be to put something in the side salad outside of lettuce and dressing.  Mix in some other veggies for variety.  We've been 2 or 3 times and the sandwich I've had has always been good.  She has enjoyed the salads each time as well.    We didn't have any of the blended drinks but that seems to be a very popular item.  If that is your thing, definitely give them a try here.  Service is always very good and the outdoor seating is great for the pups and the people watching.  Should be tried by anyone looking for a salad/sandwich cruising around old town.",

All par for the course, given the quality of the food. The juices are fresh squeezed or pressed and they offer gluten free and vegetarian options as well. The prices are a bit on the steeper end. As the saying goes  \"you get what you pay for\"  (refer to the adjectives at the start of the review) I love to take people to the Chop Shop to help encourage them to eat healthier. It has been a great way to open people up to the possibility of healthy food tasting amazing as well.",

Reason for the 3 stars is I've been here so many times and can't seem to have a superb service experience.  One thing I experience every time that I feel can easily be fixed is the fact that if you order food and a fresh squeezed juice to eat there, they give you a number and will bring the food out to you however they won't bring the juice. I've even asked about it because I find it so odd that I have to keep on coming up to the counter to see if my juice is ready, but yet my food can be brought to me.  Can't you kill two birds with one stone and just bring out both for the convenience of the customer? Last time I was there, I was eating alone so I kept going up to the counter to see if my juice was ready, meanwhile my food was brought out to my table and was getting cold. Come to find out that \"someone must of taken my juice by accident\" (or they forgot to make it) which is why it was never there. Like I said, love love the great food, but the whole process could be a lot easier and more convenient when dining in.",

We were so bummed out and disappointed. This is not at all how I remembered it! What use to be comparable to The Mother Earth Bowl at FlowerChild now seemed to be made with frozen vegetables! I could not believe it. The carrots appeared to be the cubed frozen ones! The broccoli, and cauliflower, frozen veggies, the mushrooms seemed canned. I tasted nothing comparable to Thai or coconut whatsoever. The chicken was  an odd cube shape, and minimal. I still want to go back and give it another shot, but I can't recommend the Thai Coconut Chicken Bowl. Such a bummer to remember this place being so good only to return and be so disappointed.",

I have a fair amount of legitimate food allergies so of course I get to be the wonderfully annoying soul who gets to ask the kitchen what is in everything. So much to my surprise, I learned that every single one of their salad dressings has sugar in it, why? I'm not too sure, but according to their cooks that's the case. Even the quinoa, is cooked with chicken broth, and the lemon sauce that is pre-mixed into it has dairy in it. SO EVEN quinoa, which should be a no brainer on the vegan front, is in fact not vegan. The salads, which should be the healthiest option, are laden in sugary dressings. It'd be nice if they really sat down with someone who knows their business on the health food and vegan fronts and stopped making asinine decisions like putting chicken broth on vegetables, and making all salad dressings with sugar.  Also, if you are going to put on a front of being a health conscious restaurant, your employees should be prepared to get a lot of questions about ingredients from the truly health conscious.",

Not a long line and we were able to get a table no problem, which is nice because it was normally really busy at lunch hours.  I had the shrimp protein bowl which was excellent. You can choose from four grains to add with the protein and vegetables, so I got half sweet potato hash and half \"forbidden\", or black, rice. It was delicious, especially after adding some siracha! Last time I did the chicken protein bowl with quinoa and sweet potato hash, but I personally preferred the shrimp more.  I will definitely be there again soon, there juices are excellent as well!",

With that being said, I have zero self-control and a ridiculous addiction to acai bowls, so I gave in. I tried the regular acai bowl, and it was so good that I barely paid attention to my friend that I went to lunch with (sorry, Sierra).   Went back a week later for dinner and ordered an acai bowl again, and then ordered one more to split with my friend since we were still a little hungry. The young gentleman who brought the second acai bowl to the table greeted me with \"oh uh, you already ate one?\", and a dirty look.   Hey man, I don't need you judging my life choices. Not like I ordered 3 cheeseburgers with extra fries. Step off your high horse, por favor.  Anyway, judgmental food runner aside, the place is cute and the food is incomparable. Almost considered transferring to ASU just to be closer.",

I got the shrimp bowl with forbidden rice and it was so flavorful, yummy and healthy! Full of yummy shrimp, veggies and that rice is super yummy. Worth the $1 upgrade. My friend got the beet salad and added chicken for $2. She's not a big eater and this was small even by her standards. For $10 they could at least add more lettuce or something to fill you up. The flavor of the salad was really good but just too small. All the salads are the same size so I would probably pass on the salads unless you aren't very hungry. The third person in my group got the Morrocan chicken sandwich. It was really bland and the bread was no good. The bread is what makes or breaks a sandwich and this bread was a fail. Its almost like a hamburger bun and just way too big. The bread/filling portion is off. All the sandwiches I saw had this same bread so I would pass on the sandwiches. We also got a Power green juice ($11 for 32 ounces) and daaaaaaamn that was SOUR! My friend liked it but I could only drink a little because each time I drank it my mouth would pucker. I've never had juice that sour before. They must have put too much lemon or something. I would recommend the rice bowls but not the salads or sandwiches.",

With no way to prepare meals due to a kitchen project under way, we were in fairly constant need of a quick, light option for take out. Success at the ChopShop! It was such a relief to have something this close to home with healthy options and quick service.  The menu is versitile and allows for easy customizations. I've always ordered the salads, but I have yet to try one I don't like. The tofu isn't too bad, though it's a little on the squishy side rather than the crispy/firm side. The dressings are light and lovely to boot. The sandwiches are actually quite large. My hubby seemed to enjoy his sandwich with the only comment being the bread was a tad dry, but he really loves the chocoalte peanut butter shake with espresso. He rarely even orders a chewable meal from here anymore.  I haven't tried the breakfast options and while there aren't that many, they look delicious. Juice and drink options are great with a fabulous tea selections. When it's busy the take out orders have been a little slow, but that's to be expected. It appears dogs are welcome on the patio which is always a plus! Overall I strongly recommend this place for a quick and light bite that appeases any diet.",

My supervisor (my supervisor is well known aka a public figure I won't mention who she is) and I came in for a mid-morning break. We both ordered smoothies and we both had horrible experiences.  Syd the kid coughed into my cup while she was writing my name on the cup. I demanded a new cup and she was like \"why do you want another cup\" and I said cause you coughed into it. She rolled her eyes and got another cup.  At this time a few customers recognized my supervisor and was asking to take photos with her which held up the line. Finally supervisor ordered her drink. As the others who were starstrucked to see my supervisor went away someone behind the counter asked Syd the kid if she knew who that woman was. Syd the kid said \"who knows. Probably a stripper\". wrong Syd!  Why don't you read the news a bit more often before making a complete fool of yourself. Even sadder that she knew her name (for the cup) and she has a very unique name that even if you couldn't recognize her by face at least do so by name! Supervisor heard and had this look of disgust on her face. Great impression of old town she must have had!  We both had the pina-kale-Ada which was okay. Didn't taste organic.",

One morning during my break, I came over to the Old Town location for breakfast. I wanted breakfast food, but it's usually pretty difficult to find breakfast food that's vegan friendly, and the menu wasn't looking too vegan friendly. However, the nice lady that was helping me immediately hooked it up, and accommodated something on the breakfast menu to be vegan. It was a small feat, but she did it without fretting, and I felt taken care of. So, a huge kudos to whoever was working morning crew on 8/3, specifically whoever was up at front taking orders. I will absolutely be returning for many more meals! Great stuff!",

But even better, is that it's affordable. A good-sized salad for $7, $9 with chicken? Oh snap! That's a great price. Fresh, warm chicken and just the right amount of dressing. I inhaled that thing in like 5 min. My boyfriend had a salad as well, but him being a 6'2\" man, the salad didn't really fill him up. But whatever, it's all about us, right ladies? Haaay! Totally kidding, that's really bitchy. He ended up ordering a strawberry/banana protein shake that was very good to satisfy his manly tummy. Too bad it's a little far from my house, about 15-20 min. But if I'm in the area or have time, it's totally worth it.   Only complaint is that I feel they should have nutritional facts about their items listed somewhere. It's a health-conscious restaurant, after all. That type of crowd tends to want to know that stuff. I know I did when I was there. Please open a downtown Phoenix location! :)",

I had the Kale Caeser and it was fantastic. The lemon-dijon dressing is definitely to die for. My only complaint was that there weren't enough tomatoes for me. I cannot wait to dig into the rest of the fare...and alas I have tried two of the fresh juices. The liver cleanse and the power green were to two I tried and they were fabulous. I love fresh juice, and the flavor combinations are powerful. The server almost gave my juice to the wrong person, but thankfully they write your name on the cup to avoid this confusion. Also, having written your name down the staff addresses you personally and it creates a more familiar feeling.  Go try Chop Shop! Your body will thank you.",

The patio has been expanded, and was almost fully occupied around noonish. Inside, a small line awaited, where a super friendly order-taker manned the register. No ordinary order-taker however, he described the tri-tip to a customer, explaining he was a \"meat man\" with genuine enthusiasm and impressive menu knowledge.   Greeted with a big smile, I ordered the trip tip sandwich, telling him it was based on his recommendation. He explained he was talking about the OTHER tri-tip selection (the protein dish), but my choice was equally excellent- with apple and horseradish sauce making it \"tangy.\" Sold!  I ordered an iced tea, delivered right there at the counter, and given a number for table delivery. Grabbed a deuce by the window, and waited no more than 5 for my sandwich and salad to arrive.  Plated unceremoniously but \"green-ly\" on an open-faced cardboard carry out, I was slightly disappointed to see that the \"whole wheat bread\" was a like a pita, only in halves. Seeing the tri-tip was cut into cubes, I was sure my sammy was going to be dropping meat bombs like a Sam Kinison buffet. No worries - the bread held up for a very G-rated lunch experience.   The side salad was straight chopped greens, but with a thin and sweet viniagrette. Punch this puppy up with some vinegar and seasoning and happy I will be.  As for the sandwich, the meat was tender, not overdone. The apples and splash horseradish were good complements, but again, some use some KICK. The feint of heart don't order horseradish! I ended up grabbing some Sriracha to add more flavor-boost.   Overall, there is promise and I will be back to try more, soon.   Some notes to management:  First suggestion: move the espresso machine with cups piled high on top (which hides the bottom half of the menu board), to the back wall, where the Ice Tea station is.    #2 - Put the tea station on that white table below the chalk board for self-serve. Other than holding some vases, it serves no purpose (unless it's a bus station, which would be yucky out front). Guests expect refills with ice tea. Charge me another 50 cents, I can handle that.   #3 If what I had was exemplary, take the food from good to exceptional with more seasoning.   Good luck Chop Shop! Hope you're a Scottsdale staple soon.",

    "text": "We were glad to see a healthier restaurant open up in Old Town, since there aren't many around.   This place was pretty good. The staff were friendly and full of energy, which is always great. I ordered the tri tip sandwich. The meat was cooked well and had good seasoning. The cheese on the sandwich was delicious and arugula was fresh. The \"low carb\" bread was just meh. I'm not quite sure if it's really low carb or if it's low carb because the slices were so thin! The side salad it came with was also nice. Decent portion, nice light dressing. Maybe some garnish on the salad would have been nice, extra veggies or something.   Overall I'd give this place a 3.5 if I could but I will round up since I would go back. The breakfast menu looked solid so I will have to check that out one of these days.",

    "text": "I had brunch at Original Chop Shop last weekend and was pleasantly surprised!   I know that it is relatively new but it felt like a great neighborhood spot that was well-settled.  Their outdoor patio right on the corner of Scottsdale Rd and 5th is easy to spot, and I didn't have any trouble finding parking nearby at 12:00 on Saturday. The tables feature little hooks for your handbag, which is a thoughtful feature, especially outdoors where you may not want to set your stuff on the dusty ground.   The restaurant seems to be pup friendly, as I saw a few dogs seated outside with their owners and a tiny one in his owner's arms while they waited in line to order.   I tried their Kidney cleanse juice while waiting in line which was pretty sweet and ... GREEN. It was good, although I'm not a juicer, so I didn't finish it.   For lunch, I tried the Chicken protein plate. It was hearty, the flavors were good but not totally overwhelming. It comes with chicken, roasted veggies, and forbidden rice tossed with a peanut thai coconut sauce. I had hoped for some spice from the sauce, but to no avail - it was very mild. My favorite part was the forbidden rice - good texture and yummy with the sauce. The combination of elements was satisfying and it was a good portion size, particularly for the price (under $10)   My friend had the BBQ Chicken chopped salad, which looked really tasty. She enjoyed it but said it was a bit over-dressed, so she wished she had ordered the dressing on the side. Again, a generous portion size that she didn't finish.   It is a counter service restaurant, and the one place that could use a little improvement is service - it wasn't bad, just wasn't particularly warm/welcoming. Adding great, memorable service to their excellent location and solid food would make this a regular stop for me.   I do recommend it if you're looking for a healthyish option for lunch in Old Town.",

When I came in, I saw a big carton of apples, carrots and celery ready to be brought into the kitchen. I had the breakfast wrap with an iced cappuccino. My friend had one of the breakfast bowls with brown rice. Skip the long lines at Breakfast Club and walk down the road to ChopShop. You will get more appropriately sized portions at half the price of the hyped up breakfast spots. The Chop Shop does lunch sandwiches where the bread are these pocket rolls and the inside is stuffed with all the sandwich fixin's. Chop Shop is an excellent choice for breakfast or lunch.",

I juice often and for me don't have to clean up after juicing plus the low price, sign me up.   Also got the beet salad for $7, which was good but I wish there were more greens in my bowl.

The dates, currants, apple, blue cheese, almond combo is killer and delicious. The salads are definitely good-sized, but I like to get a carb-based side to go with it to make it truly filling. The $1.50 Quinoa side hits the spot.  Highly recommend having lunch here! Parking on the street can be impossible during the work week, but there is a large parking garage just a block away.",

We asked the skinny hipster to replace the creamer. He said he would \"get to it\" with a smirk. Waited another 5 minutes and by this time the ice is pretty much melted. Decided to stand at the register so they would notice us. We then were told that they didn't have any creamer left...This is starting to get annoying AF. How do you run out of creamer?!

First off, yes the place is crawling with skinny girls because the menu caters to the anorexic, but the food is actually filling and appetizing!  I love the American Salad and the BBQ Chicken Salad! Try both as a wrap when you need a bit more sustenance than a bowl of lettuce.  Honestly though, these salads are packed with enough goodies to fill you up without leaving you so full that you have to roll down Scottsdale Rd!    The staff is friendly and witty.  Very hipster and laid back, but thankfully they don't take forever on your orders.  If it does take a while they make sure to put you at ease with a quirky joke.  There is an outside and an inside, but I have only sat outside.  The misters practically gave my friend a shower, but it was super sweaty out so she didn't mind too much.    I am NOT a juicer and literally gag at the thought of it, but some of my friends love to mush their food up into a juice because it's the trendy, hip thing to do and they rave about the juices here.  So if you juice, juice on at Chop Shop.  An actual juice that I love is the Blood Orange Lemonade.  Seriously delicious and has a perfect tart to sweet ratio...and doesn't have spinach or anything green in it.   This little gem is one that will be loved by those looking for a healthy option and their fat friends.",

Today I ordered a salad, and usually when its go they put the dressing on the side, but todays salad was DRENCHED in dressing. Like super soggy.

I'm obsessed. And never been more pleased. The employees are all really nice, and it's always crazy busy so they're workin their tails off.

    "text": "I went to Chop Shop for a Friday lunch with a few friends who were ready to get out of the office. It was a beautiful day, and the indoor/outdoor seating was perfect, letting us get a little fresh air with our delicious meal!   When we walked in, the line was long (as it often is - but don't let that turn you off... it moves fairly quickly), and the seating was scarce. Having been before, I consider this a testament to the quality of the food, which is completely worth the wait! I always get the beet salad with chicken and the sweet potato hash, which are both great!! (As a born and raised Southerner, I can be hard to please when it comes to my sweet potatoes... With a little salt, these are on point!) My salad was fresh and absolutely fantastic. The quality of the raw greens in particular was outstanding. I'm not a huge salad dressing person, but on the beet salad, the vinaigrette is so light that it doesn't obscure the taste of the veggies, giving each bite a refreshing finish!  I wouldn't recommend a large group at Chop Shop just because the seating is so limited. It's designed, as far as I can tell, to be a quick service restaurant for small parties (you order at a counter and they bring it out to you), where you can get quality food for a reasonable price. Not a lot of big groups, and not a lot of people lingering when they finish... though it's perfect for a post-workout meal or a mid-day escape from the office!  Side note, they welcome pets outside! Another great bonus for Chop Shop! Also, a check in on yelp is good for a free coffee with the purchase of a breakfast item. :)",

Food is made quick and is brought to your table which is nice.

Tasty and good for ya, nothing is totally amazing (again, it's sorta meant to be fast food.) I've been here at least two dozen times but only for takeout, it's just too much of a clusterf*** during peak times. Weekday breakfast has been wide open though, and to my recollection dinner all the time as well. It's just jammed at lunchtime.   Menu is a bit monotonous which makes sense for the concept (wish they had daily specials tho), staff varies between really nice and really standoffish, and I do not like their sandwich bread at all (wraps are a bit better.) Parking can be a real b of course cos of the location, so keep that in mind if doing takeout, and remember that a brief walk pre-meal is good for you.  Protein bowls are my favorite, salads are good too. Again, all really solid, nothing out of this world. Go go and go again, support businesses like this one, we need food like this to be our fast food!!! Love ya ChopShop!",

It used to be a basic gluten free sourdoughish bread that wasn't fantastic but it wasn't bad either. The new bread is some kind of rye??? that tastes awful and sparked an allergic reaction in my mouth. So, now if I eat here it's a salad or a wrap, but the price is a bit high to make Chop Shop a continual option. Really bummed because I used to eat here once a week... now it's once in awhile",

    "text": "Whether you are looking for a quick lunch that you can call in to pick-up, a place to sit for a few hours and enjoy time with friends or somewhere to go for Happy Hour, the Original ChopShop is a good option to consider.  With three current locations and two more coming soon, there most likely is one nearby with a short drive. The first few times I went to ChopShop I didn't love it, nor did I understand why there were people who did. After a while, my friends convinced me to go again and try something new. After I had tried what people seemed to love, I found a new favorite. ChopShop offers \"healthy craft cuisine\" with vegan, organic, and paleo options.   I prefer the Scottsdale location for a few different reasons, but both the Scottsdale and Tempe locations have their downfalls. The Scottsdale location is in Old Town, which offers very limited parking and does not have a parking lot specifically designated for ChopShop. However, the restaurant itself is spacious and bright on the inside. The restaurant has tables, booths and picnic tables outside with a very rustic look. The location of the Tempe ChopShop I think is inconvenient. It only is accessible through a small alley that is difficult to see and the parking lot isn't large enough to easily back out which is a hassle as well. The service in Scottsdale is great. The employees are kind and friendly. They are very popular, and therefore busy throughout the day. However, expect a small wait on the food once you order.  The menu has a wide variety of fresh options, and catering is also available too. The drink options include lemonade, coffee, Kombucha on tap, protein shakes, and fresh squeezed juices. For preference reasons, I don't think the juices are my favorite. There is a \"Rise + Shines\" menu which is available for breakfast Monday-Friday from 7 AM to 12 PM, and 7 AM-2 PM Saturday and Sunday as well. ChopShop caters to the needs of many - with gluten-free and vegan options available. According to their menu online, \"fresh baked pastries\" are available. In the store, there are only about five \"pastry\" options which include cookies, scones and muffins. I wouldn't consider the pastries freshly baked, nor would I recommend them to anyone who considers themselves a pastry connoisseur. Other small options include their superfruit bowls and parfaits, which are quite tasty if you prefer something fruity. There are eight different salads to choose from. Their Asian salad, which includes house greens, bok choy, snap peas, carrot, green onion, cashews, sesame seeds, and radish topped with a red chili vinaigrette - is the only salad that I have tried, but is a great option. They serve eight different sandwich options, all which can substitute the 12 grain ciabatta for a whole wheat or gluten-free wrap. I have tried the Chicken + Prosciutto as well as the Club sandwich, which were not very impressive. I found the chicken on the chicken and prosciutto to be very dry, which tends to happen frequently when I order a dish with chicken. What I do love, is their Grilled Protein Bowls. All of their bowls are served with roasted broccoli, cauliflower, onion, carrot, and mushroom. You get to choose also from brown rice, sweet potato rice, forbidden rice, or quinoa. My ChopShop favorite is the Teriyaki Chicken, which has avocado, brussels sprout, and sesame seeds. My exact order includes the teriyaki chicken without mushrooms, with one-half brown rice one-half sweet potato hash.  Despite my own preferences, there is something there that anyone will love. Despite a small wait and difficult parking, dining there is worth the stop. If you are not a local, ChopShop is a great place to try. Even if you are a local, it still is!",

My go-to's are the Chicken Protein Bowl (so tasty and filling) and the Asian salad with chicken, but made into a wrap. Boyfriend loves the Grinder sandwich, and I've also been very satisfied with the Moroccan Turkey.   One tip is to sub out a wrap for their sandwich bread, I just think they're much better that way!  The only downsides are that parking, much like in the rest of Old Town, can be pretty hit or miss, and it can get crowded there during mealtimes. However, we usually just call in an order and have one person hop out at the curb while the other remains in the car. No parking and no waiting!",

I'm not exaggerating when I say that EVERY time I've tried any kind of baked good from the chop shop it has been stale tasting.

The Asian chicken wrap, acai bowl, and power green are awesome! Service is always great. I have only two suggestions. 1.Perhaps a second juicer so when one is being cleaned it does not cause such a long wait time? 2. When I call into order ahead the computer tells me to wait on hold, then the associate picks up and asks me to hold. Kind of redundant. I am happy to hold as long as is necessary but I am ready to order when the human picks up the phone. Minor things really. Overall a fantastic place to eat where I can be confident the food is healthy! Thank you CHOPSHOP!!",

Love the tri-tip protein plate (which has an amazing teriyaki like sauce and is filling but not heavy), the raw vegetable salad (which I get with chicken), Asian salad (which I get with steak) and the zen bowl for breakfast (interesting, scrambled eggs and brown rice - who would of thought??). I wish they had better baked goods. My friend ordered a scone and it could not have been drier if it were made of sawdust. On the whole, however, salads and rice bowls are great. Juice blends are good and made fresh right in front of you.",

As soon as the OGs sold, the new owners decreased the quality immensely. The chicken isn't fresh anymore, they buy it pre marinated then cook frozen or some kind of delivery. The chicken has more of a raw or rubber texture. The smoothies taste odd, sort of like the difference between soda and diet soda but more tasteless. The salads all taste the same now which is disappointing. The staff still has no idea what they're doing or maybe they don't care? I understand your busy hours. But it also doesn't take 10-15 to make a five ingredient smoothie. I stand there and watch your staff stare, rolling their eyes with the stack of smoothie cups then walk away. Also sad you don't promote organic foods anymore. If you actually still post the meat is organic, please do us a favor and take it down. Thanks!",

I still can't justify five stars, as the staff is overworked, and gets very impatient with you if you are unsure of your order or need help. It's also very loud inside, I suggest eating outside.   If you can get in, order fast, and don't try to chit chat, you will get a meal that's pretty tasty and healthy.  I haven't explored the menu.  I always stick with the bowls.

Unlucky for me, I don't live in Scottsdale :/  Things I loved: -Solid portion: I got the Tri-Tip protein plate and it was more than enough. If I didn't live in a hotel that weekend, I would have totally split it into 2 meals, but I had no refrigerator.  -Actually healthy: You know places like Chili's or Applebees where you feel all proud for resisting that fatty burger and ordering the salad only to find out that the salad was more caloric than the burger because of all the dressing? Yeah, it's not like that at ChopShop. You can tell that they use fresh ingredients and the taste was not overwhelming at all. In fact, it was deliciously balanced. -FORBIDDEN RICE: It's in all caps. Need I say more?  One thing I didn't love, but was still ok with: -Just a little pricey: I think I was ok with the price of the protein plate but their juices/smoothies are outrageously pricey. I got the 16 oz. slim squeeze and it was $5.50. Their 32 oz. are $10! I know they put a lot of ingredients in there but come, it's just fruit in the end. Tasted good, but don't think I'm willing to spend that much again.  If I ever come back to Scottsdale, I'll definitely make another visit!",

So thankfully there's a juice bar that that serves amazingly fresh-pressed juices to hydrate the body - which in turn hydrates your skin, hair, etc.   The juice concoctions are creative. I'm a fan of the Liver Cleanse: beet, apple, ginger, lemon parsley and aloe. Their juices are pricier than I've paid in other cities ($10 for the large), but they're also the largest servings I've ever seen (but with a lot of ice). I also wanted an immunity boost shot to-go (not on their menu, but it's lemon juice, ginger and cayenne). They don't offer any cayenne, unfortch, but they should totally work that lil' spice into some of their juices. It's has magical powers for the body, yo!!! :)  With salads and sandwiches, breakfast, smoothies and coffees also on the menu, this makes for the perfect breakfast or lunch spot! Do try the Moroccan Turkey on their low carb bread! I really enjoyed that light lunch with a gourmet kick.",

    "text": "It is my utmost pleasure to write my first Yelp review for this amazing establishment!!   A year ago I moved to New York City and one of my goodbyes outside of friends and family, was ChopShop #sadface   Please open another location in Manhattan, this juice bar called Liquteria has no idea what they're doing!!   For the snowbirds, you must try this place!! Also, any basic betches from LA you can find harmony at Chopshop if you're visiting for the weekend.  The liver cleanse (order a regular size but request it in a large cup with extra ice) saved me on the weekends after an evening at Bottled Blonde (aka where souls go to die) Another favorite is the PBJ smoothie and open faced breakfast sandwich. Also their kale salad is best with an extra side of dressing since the packaging doesn't quite get it right.   My only tip to the owner is for the staff to be a little better at remembering your regulars...I know the place gets busy but it felt a little insulting when my same cashier multiple times in one weekend would ask for my name.......   Keep on keeping on!",

I called in my order of the tri tip sandwich. So I get back to work with my sandwich, it looks appetizing enough. Take a bite, some good flavors but I only taste a little bit of trip which is fine because it's the first bite, one more, and I am only tasting trace amounts of meat. So i open up the sandwich, and there is a pile of greens with apple and mushrooms, sauteed onions but I only had maybe 3 pieces of meat on the half I had bitten into which was disappointing. I took a look at the second half and the same thing, 1 big chunk of meat and about 3 or 4 thin slices that couldn't have weighed more than 2 or so oz's. When you think of a tri tip sandwich, it's meat and the toppings should compliment it. Instead I felt like I was biting into a salad between two wheat buns.  Highly disappointed.",

    "text": "This place took over the old Philadelphia Sandwich Company space (they moved around the corner) about a year ago and it is like a whole different world. Not only is the food the complete opposite - healthy and fresh salads, bowls and wraps instead of greasy cheese steaks - but also the restaurant got a total makeover and expansion. It's a very cute place but it gets crazy busy at lunch time. Best strategy seems to be to go with a friend and have one of you hover and pounce on a table while the other stands in line to order. That is what my friend and I did and we got in and out in under an hour since they bring the food out pretty fast. Also, I thought that the prices were very reasonable for this part of Scottsdale.  I had the beet salad and it was fantastic. The beets were in huge delectable chunks and the greens were not wilted. And plenty of other little goodies like flecks of goat cheese, golden raisins and chopped cashews. I did not find that they used too much dressing at all (even though other reviews mentioned this) - it was very light and barely noticeable. I loved the fact that they had a few different kinds of flavored (but unsweetened) iced teas in seasonal flavors... I've been on a bit of an iced tea kick lately. The one I tried was a raspberry green tea, I believe. I'm looking forward to trying more off their menu in the future since my friend has been raving about this place for months!",

I question why I still come here after I have had 5 orders messed up in the last 2 months. I literally came in asked for chicken kale ceaser salad with no tomatoes or cheese. Instead I paid 10$ for a bowl of fresh kale and croutons. What a joke, I really do not know how they can mess up my order almost every time, especially since I stop in pretty often. I usually stop here to get something quick and healthy. But instead I waste my time and money with a bowl of leaves and breadcrumbs because chicken must not be common in salads....HAHAHHAHA WHAT A JOKE! I officially will never waste another dime or my time on the disappointing service and careless people taking my order!",

I had high hopes due to the reviews and I have to say the reviews were spot on. The shrimp were bountiful and perfectly cooked. The rice and veggies were also perfect. For a kick I added siracha but who doesn't.   The bowl had a great balance of flavors and I could barely finish it all. The lemonade was ok, nothing great but did quench my thirst.   Overall, I'll be back (terminator voice of course).",

Most places like this will nickel and dime you to swap rice for veggies or other similar substitutions to make your meal healthier. Not them though. I got a bowl exactly how I wanted it and it didn't cost me a penny more than they advertised the original.   The food is super fresh, really flavorful, and they even had an awesome Belizian hot sauce (Sharps) that I fell in love with when I was there. When will they expand to San Diego?

I also love the protein shakes (PB&J and Muscle Malt), green juices (Green No.4), and the Asian Chicken Salad. Best of all, they have baked goods such as cookies and blonde brownies, where all of the ingredients are on the label, and you can pronounce and identify all of them! (Whaaaatttt?!) ;) They also have a little shop area where you can buy different healthier snacks and bars to try. Service can be a bit difficult here sometimes, but I know they are super busy all the time. I highly recommend going to Chop Shop!!",

    "text": "Update:: After I received a  message in regards to my post, I have changed my star rating. They did what customer service is about- it's True definition of customer service... correction of a problem until customer satisfaction. I have totally re visited multiple times.... food still good.. customer service better.... totally satisfied-------  Update stars to match food and service   See above   spend a great deal with the Chop Shop. I love the choices. The service, however is not up to par. Each time it's something- usually things that you can overlook- obviously I kept coming back. This morning I presented my order Pina-kale- ada sub soy for almond,  whey for vegan protein. There was one person waiting on an order from kitchen with an acai bowl in hand. So basically no one in the establishment waiting. Great I will have time to spare on my way to work. I watched as a young lady  start my order ( I thought - until she added peanut butter) - must be a call in order. She then turns around as a gentleman walks in and says hello, he sees she is working hard - she then stops marking the order and comes to assist- although there are several other people who were taking orders ( breaking from making lemonade) and one juicing- and She tells him his order is ready- explaining what she did and removing his order from the fridge and then turns the cup of what looks like a yogurt parfait of sorts into a bowl. He then opens his package from sprouts wraps up in a napkin and hands it too her- she giggled and then rang him up. After this transaction she then grabs a cup of lemonade and decided to chat with the staff.. now, no one is making my order. The young lady that took my order walks over to the abandoned drink and ask what's going on here.. the  one who started my order states that she forgot about that ( really?- you don't say). The lady that took my order says this is a pina - kale - lada- what were you making? She kinda just laughs - I. However. Am unamused. I check my time- My ten minutes have gone .  She kinda shakes her head and took over making my order, but suddenly she goes to the back.. I decide to ask if I should just get a refund and repeat what just transpired .. the guy who was juicing says it will just be about a minute, that they are waiting on apple juice... and suddenly the second young lady appeared with a jug of apple juice ... my order was completed within that minute... so basically a two minute drink took over 10 minutes to make... I thanked the guy and girl for realizing how long I was waiting and accommodating me ... Although they came to the rescIt wasn't one more thing that I could overlook.",

My only knock on the place is that the menu is a little pricey so I ended up spending over $20 for breakfast by myself.   Although... I did get an iced coffee, a protein smoothie, a bottle of water, and a breakfast sandwich called the Open Faced Sandwich so that was kind of on me.  It was so good that I forgot to take a pic until I had almost polished it off.",

So first off you walk up and order, then they bring your food to your table. The menu is on the board near the order area.   I had the BBQ chop salad- there wasn't any BBQ sauce just so you know Which I didn't realize until I got my food. Regardless the salad was really good. $9.  I had the strawberry ginger drink. Really good. Just expensive -$3.50 for a medium.   They do have an interesting menu of tofu, coconut chicken, shrimp, smoothies....   Everything was good, just pricey for being simple for what I ordered at least",

No dressing for the salads, forget the protein on the salad, or the extra veggie topping, or maybe it's a completely different wrap all together than the one I ordered, maybe it's not even chicken, but cheese? It never fails, we order, repeat the order back, someone on the other line assures us they got it. we get there, check the order and without fail, SOMETHING ALWAYS IS MISSING! Often we don't realize it until we've gotten all the way home. It honestly isn't just one time here or there. This is every time we get takeout from ChopShop Oldtown.

So happy to have a yummy, healthy restaurant nearby.",

Scarfed down the salad and wanted to order more, but we had dinner reservations and wanted to save room haha.  We came back the next night and ordered the dragonfruit bowl and a chocolate protein shake. The fruit bowl was so fresh, and exactly what I needed. I could eat that everyday and be content with life. Didn't try the shake, but the bf said it was pretty good.  Service was fine, employees were friendly enough, food came out quickly, and the prices are fair for what you're getting. I'll definitely make this a regular stop when I'm in town. Healthy fast food for the win!",

Then, the lines are very very long.  They do have an option to call in ahead, so if I were to come back I think I would do that instead of waiting in the Escher-style-never-ending line.    However, food choices are clean and healthy which I love.  I ordered the beet salad which was good.  Nothing stellar, but nothing offensive.  My friend loved her raw vegetable salad (she added tofu, which she raved about), so I think I would come back to try it again, but only if I could call ahead and do it take-out style instead of fighting the midday Scottsdale crowd.",

The staff has always been helpful & cheery every time I have visited, & the atmosphere of the whole restaurant & patio area are so adorable.   At first glance the menu may seem limited but there really are so many options for delicious and healthy food. Their juices, teas, and lemonade have been absolutely perfect every time I have ordered.   The main reason ChopShop has earned a place in my heart though, their tofu is ALWAYS cooked perfectly. It is difficult to find a restaurant that consistently puts out good and delicious tasting tofu, and ChopShop has yet to disappoint me.   Their breakfast menu & pastries have been tempting each visit, but I have yet to actually try them out, next visit for sure!!",

Plus the outdoor patio is pet-friendly.   (Disclaimer- If the thought of pets anywhere near your food repulses you or you do not like dogs, you will not like the vunerability of this feature.)   Also, please note that service can be slow during particularly busy times.  Otherwise  you may easily enjoy 1 of 2 of their refreshing and restorative versions of the \" Green Drink\" every morning.  They are that delicious! :-)  My favorite was the \"Power Green Drink.\"  It is suppose to help support kidney functions and had such a light, lemoney delicious taste. Not to mention, it was a healthy, energy boast to the start of my day while in the Tempe, AZ area.    After one \"cheat day\" of artery clogging fast food burgers on the go,  the great offerings of the original Chop Shop Company will help your taste buds jump right back on the straight road to the proverbial, healthy-diet-food-choice bandwaggon going forward. I need Chop Shop in my life on the East Coast! :-(  If you enjoy healthy, clean eating and are in the Tempe, AZ area near University Blvd and East William Circle, the original Chop Shop Company is a must! :-)  Sorry, the commercial Protein Bar franchises on every other corner in my city do not even compare to this healthy dining experience.",

Not sure how high the turnover is in the kitchen, but it seems like my shrimp protein bowl always tastes uniquely different. I enjoy new experience though, so I don't get hung up on the fact that inconsistency seems to run in the DNA of Chop Shop's culinary creations.   We enjoy sitting out on the sidewalk, watching the comedy of errors that is Scottsdale though - like an episode of People of WalMart, we always leave feeling better about ourselves and our life choices. #winning  Staff are uninterested in creating an experience, but that's expected, it's Old Town. So no harm, no foul there I suppose.   That's about all there is to say about - the remodel was a much needed change, and the fact that dogs are welcomed outside is great as well.",

Also- I know this place has a ton of fans, a lot of people I know, but I haven't found a dish that I like. I tried a salad and it was drowning in dressing, and the scrambled eggs were crusty. The second time I tried to eat there I had the steak sandwich, I ordered it without certain ingredients that came on it anyway, and the entire sandwich was lettuce.   It may just not be my style for food, but for someone who loves to eat, it has been repeatedly disappointing.",

They have a great menu of healthy food and beverages including fresh juices which is fabulous!   Whenever I go into trendy health conscious restaurants, I kind of expect paying a little more for smaller portions of food. But this place exceeded my expectations with more than sufficient servings for a reasonable price. I got a shrimp protein bowl which was grilled shrimp (a good 10 or so pieces!), forbidden rice, and roasted broccoli, cauliflower, carrot, and mushroom with a red chili lime sauce. Amazing! For $10 well worth it and had leftovers for a snack and dinner!  My fiancee thoroughly enjoyed his tri tip sandwich saying it was one of the best he's had in a while! Love the flexibility for substitutions (gf bread, quinoa, brown rice, etc)   Can't wait to go back to roll through the menu!",

The cashier with the beard, slicked back hair, wood style glasses, and gauges was really rude and even a bit condescending while placing my order. Usually everyone is really nice and helpful so I didn't appreciate it at all. They were busy so it took awhile to get my order to go which was fine and understandable but when I got home they completely left out the chicken in my bowl. I'm sure it was a mistake but when your waiting that long and paying that much, I think you deserve better service.  I like the food and the niche that they've established but this is one of many times the Scottsdale location has messed up my order. I don't think that acceptable and I usually let it slide because of the great people that work there but that was not the case today.   Tip1 : don't hire entitled hipster kids because they fit the status quo. Hire people who are open, friendly, and personable. That's what I've always liked when going to chopshop.   Tip2 : make sure the chefs are more vigilant while preparing the food. One mistake is acceptable but to have this be an ongoing occurrence just isn't right.",

    "text": "So it's a new year and everyone is trying to eat healthy and lose weight right? Well this restaurant it the perfect place to satisfy and fill an empty stomach without the guilt. Chop Shop is all about providing healthy food for people on the go to help support the healthy lifestyle because we all know it can be difficult to find that when you're out and about and want something quick. Basically, this really is healthy \"fast food,\" not some salad from McDonalds.   Chop Shop offers sandwiches, salad, protein bowls, protein shakes, fruit bowls, coffee, tea, pressed juices, parfaits, breakfast, and they even have a kids menu. Everything is organic and is made upon ordering. No preservatives up in here.   I usually order the Club sandwich and their bread is delicious for being low carb! Recently my boyfriend helped me discover the protein bowls. Man do those things fill you up! They are full of vegetables, a protein, and either brown rice, forbidden rice, or quinoa for an extra charge. I had never had forbidden rice before, it's black in color which was surprising but nonetheless, totally yummy.   Every time I have been there, they have always been busy. So if you are truly \"on the go\" then I recommend calling ahead and placing your order so it's ready upon pick up. Otherwise, they work quickly and the food is served shortly after ordering. Their staff is friendly and makes good suggestions! I couldn't decide on brown rice or forbidden rice last time and the gal taking my order recommended doing half and half...such an easy solution!   To sum it all up: Want to eat out and eat healthy? Eat here.",

I added grilled chicken to it. For a drink I got the hydrator. Which is a mostly cucumber and greens juice. For dessert I got the available bowl, this bowl was fenomenal. A acai and berry puree mixed with ice and apple juice, covered with strawberries,banana,blueberries, shredded coconut and guava syrup.   The Chia parfait was with Greek yogurt.

    "text": "I'm extremely disappointed. I came to Chop Shop very excited because I read it's amazing reviews and several friends had recommended it. The place was packed and so I thought it must me good. I got the shrimp protein plate & a side of sweet potatoes with kale. The first thing I noticed was that everything was drenched in oil. I ate it anyway & enjoyed the flavors and assumed they used a healthy oil since the restaurant advertised as being a \"healthy cuisine\" Well immediately after I ate the meal my stomach started to kill. I went up to the girl working at the front & asked what kind of oil they used and my mouth dropped. She said \"Canola\". This is a place that is advertised as healthy. If you don't know anything about Canola it is one of the worst oils you can use. I am in shock & don't think i'm going back. Over 90% of Canola oil is genetically modified and resistant to the herbicide roundup & is extremely unhealthy.   You know that Olive Oil comes from olives, and that Sesame Seed Oil comes from sesame seeds. It would make sense that Canola Oil comes from Canola Seeds, right? Well, there's actually no such thing.  Canola is a made-up word which stands for \"Canadian oil low acid\", and is a genetically modified product. It is a Canadian invention that is backed by the government. It's a cheap product to manufacture, and many processed or packaged foods contain canola oil.  If you came to this restaurant expecting \"healthy\" food, this is not the place. Their tofu isn't organic which is also GMO and none of their food is advertised as organic. I guess I was expecting a healthy, organic, non-GMO restaurant and it wasn't what I expected. If you don't care about health and GMOs then it's a good place. Otherwise it's not for you if you want something healthy.

But, I asked for dressing on side for take out , ended up with soggy salad, stil tasted great, also first day asked for something to go and two meals to stay and sat for 20-25 mins.  waiting and when I went back in they had to find them ,all were to go. I know your busy and new, so I will keep coming, slow down a little.  thank for bringing something healthy and taste great to downtown Scottsdale.",

Which I guess is okay because it means the food is good enough to wait for it. They gave me a number for my order but then a guy told me they called my name earlier for the bowl but I never gave them my name so I walked up to the front and then they just handed me one without my name on it and no number on it so I'm not sure if I got someone else's or if I actually got mine. Still delicious and everyone else I was with loved theirs. Probably will come again but during the week instead of the weekend.",

Basically the entire salad consists of lettucs and very few other veggies scattered throughout. Why would I pay $7 for a bowl of lettuce. This place needs to really step it up- their service is pretty awful. If you have 15 people in line.. shouldn't you have 2 registers open with people taking orders? Ridiculous. They get my order wrong more often than not. I don't know why I keep giving 2nd, 3rd, 4th, 5th, chances. Hoping for a change.. not going to see one anytime soon probably.",

I'm not a big salad guy, so that's saying something. Only knock would be lack of soda fountain. I get that you are trying to be all natural hipster food, but some people like a coke with their salad or power bowl instead of flavored tea or overpriced bottled drinks.",

So the word is spreading.  So why did I deduct a star.  Dirty tables.  Not one table was clean.  Soda machine broken.  All the tea s empty.  The employees are sweet but very carefree.  They are yapping behind the counter having a good time while things are going Un done. Even in a counter place it would be nice if someone went around and checked on things.  Would it hurt for the manager to ask every table how the meal is?  But if you want healthy fresh tummy did.   Try this place.  I had bowl with brown rice and shrimp.  It was so good.  Grilled vegis cooked perfect.  I even likes the brown rice",
