We got the calamari appetizer, which was perfectly cooked and delicious. I got the gnocchi and it may have been the best gnocchi I have ever had. My wife got the chicken parmesan which was also very good. The only complaints we had were; it seemed to take a long time for our food to come out and it was a little on the pricey side. 4 entrees, an app, a salad, a dessert, 4 waters and no alcohol . Our bill was over $100, before the tip.",

I would absolutely go back as the sweet potato ravioli I had was incredible.  The server might have been busy, had a bad day, etc. but she seemed dis-interested in taking the time to listen to what we were ordering (drinks and entrees mixed up), and in general did not provide great service.

I brought my friend out to see chandler when she was in town and found this place through Yelp. We were seated at hi top by the bar, which was fine, because it was a busier Friday night. A waiter came over for our drink orders and then.... We got our bottle of wine but not iced teas. We asked again, knowing it was busy, but no dice (that time or the next time we asked). We then asked about the cheese plate. Our server didn't know what was on it and took ten minutes finding somebody who did. It was paltry at best for $14, but that's the nature of cheese plates. We asked about the specials and the waiter went off to find somebody who knew, again. He was gone for 30 minutes. No further service during this time. At this point we were so frustrated that we decided to leave. We asked for the check (which took 10 minutes) and then the waiter very awkwardly asked if he had done anything wrong :/   Based on that time only, I would give this place a 1. Since it was my first time and a Friday, I feel like that isn't fair. I did want to leave this review though so management is aware of some deficiencies in service.   We left, went next door to San Tan on a very busy Friday and had dinner, beers, AND iced teas and were out the door in 45 minutes.",

They have an extensive wine list and they give  you enough  wine  to enjoy the evening.   We were a party of 8 on a Friday night and the service was superb. The wait staff were helpful, friendly and efficient.   My minestrone soup was warm and delicious.  The grilled salmon was prepared well and served with steamed veggies that included cabbage.  I love steamed cabbage but since  most restaurants tend to overcook cabbage, La Stalla stole my heart. My group also ordered the lasagna and sweet potato ravioli. These dishes were made with fresh ingredients and well presented.  The desserts were delicious but my all time favorite dessert was the tiramisu.   La Stalla Cucina is a great place to take your guest during the upcoming holiday.",

But this was definitely left at the table. I kind of had the idea when I started to walk into the restaurant. The outside patio is surrounded by big potted dead as a doornail pots outside. Now, I know no one is probably using the patio in the dead of summer but it is the face of the restaurant and it should be kept up. When I walked in I understood why. The whole place looks dated and not that clean. I'm sorry, I really wanted to like this place.",

    "text": "This was a True let down of an experience. Food was clearly not fresh. The ambiance was a classic tacky Italian theme, which you could find at any little Italian spot. I love tacky so this worked for me, but the power cords all visible did not. The service was slow and we waited way too long to even be greeted. About 8 minutes. The specials were on a piece of paper and not explained so we were off to a slow start.   On to the food. The olive oil that sat in a clearly old reused bottle was spoiled and not pleasing. When we did get bread after a wait it was good but upon the refresh for the bread it was a focaccia instead of the baguette like before, that was not warm and delicious like the first batch. The server also had balsamic in a bullet that he spilled on the napkin it was resting on before it got to the table. Just sloppy service points.   The burrata got there and was not a bruschetta like it said on the menu. A lot of prosciutto on the plate, 7 total grape tomatoes, and burrata. It was decent, but arrived before we got the bread mentioned above.   Next was the cannellini and pasta soup and Gorgonzola pear salad. The soup was under seasoned and sloshed on the rim of the bowl. It was undersalted and definitely beans from a can versus fresh like we were told. The pears and bleu cheese dressing were also from a can being mushy on the pear front, and processed on the dressing front. Overall a let down, but appeased us once we added some salt and pepper.   Entree was the gnocchi in tomato sauce with mozzarella and fusilli pesto with mushrooms and pancetta. The fussili was decent overall but bland like the rest of the courses. The gnocchi was not even close. The sauce was definitely out of a can and blended with some basil, so nothing to write home about. The actual gnocchi was shameful at best. They had the texture of mashed potatoes bound with a touch of flour and no salt. It smooshed into the side of the bowl with the back of the fork, and left imprints as it was not either mixed properly, or boiled and blanched properly. It was definitely not seared in the pan for texture that the dish needed, but if it was cooked properly originally we would have been able to look past that as it is a preference for crispy. When I made sure to explain how it is not properly cooked, our server joe (joeseph as it read on the receipt) told us there's nothing they could do to fix it. Offered no apology. And still charged us for it at the end. Never spoke to, or even saw a manager on the floor. This would have definitely helped us to explain further how to help with future guests.   I have been in the hospitality industry for 15 years holding multiple chef titles specializing in overhauling restaurants systems and standards. I want to make sure that they can improve on the finer points and make downtown chandler that much better for food.",

Although the place does feel a little cheap, that wasn't a negative, it was just an opinion of mine, what was the worst was the food. We started with the calamari and it was THE worst calamari I have ever had. I actually don't think it was calamari, but just some frozen fish sticks in the back. We then ordered our main meals and I ordered a pizza which was tasty! My boyfriend ordered a brocolli pasta dish and it was not good at all. It was covered in oils and butter to the point that nothing was on his noodles, but he ended with a soup of liquids abottom his plate. Honestly, the services was really great though. We had a very impressive waiter and everyone else there was very kind. I'm not sure if it's just because they just opened at this location, but I just think they could have done so much better. It was about $100 at the end of our meal and we left unsatisfied, unfortunately. I think as long as they focus on putting some more though into their food and their decor they will be able to make it. Seems like the recipes are good and there are items with potential, but it's not being reached at all.",

    "text": "I do not know what is going on at this place.  Big sign out front ($8.00) lunch specials.  This is the second time this has happened.  I took friends there last week for lunch.  I asked for the \"lunch menu\" and was given a menu.  I inquired about lunch, and the waitress emphatically stated \"this is the lunch menu.\"  This did not show the $8 specials.  After we had the regular lunch I asked the waitress about this and she said \"you did not say you wanted the special lunch menu.\"   She said \"I gave you the lunch menu.\"  I don't think they should advertise this special and then try and prevent patrons from having it.  Also, they advertise \"Happy Hour\" but you have to personally walk around to the bar and order your drink even it you are having diner in order for Happy Hour to apply.  I don't understand this \"bait and switch mentality.\"",

The tortellini soup is amazing and the many pasta dishes are wonderful. Located in beautiful downtown Chandler, this is a gem. Did I metioned the outstanding service? Not the cheapest in town but the quality, service and Atmosphere are worth it.",

My gf wanted asparagus instead of the vegetable side. Absolutely not!! He charged her 4.00 for three asparagus. Salads are not included with the meals, although the waiter acted as if they were when asking us if we wanted one. If you order the sea bass be sure to have bread near by...full of bones!  Usually a restaurant will do a little something for a bday, he gave us a menu for desert. 50.00 a piece, not impressed. Will not return.",

Which is eggplant rolotini with prosciutto. It was very good but beyond temperature hot. Too hot to even eat. Eggplant was light and the cheese was plentiful. Highly recommend this dish but ask for it out of the crock. It never seemed to cool off. My husband had the Tagliatelle alla Toscana. Which is basically fettuccine with a meat sauce. The sauce lacked some flavor, just couldn't put my finger on which flavor. Glad we tried this place, would go back if asked but wouldn't say it's a fav place of mine.",

    "text": "My wife was given a great recommendation on this place, WOW were they ever wrong, as a Northeast person, raised in an Italian household this is NOT Great, Good or even mediocre Italian food. 1st the hostess would not wait on us because she doesn't like my daughters, had a waiter seat US. Then were we sat in a table pushed closer to other tables with a large area open in the middle, why??? I do not know!! As for the service it was OK, at least our waitress didn't screw up the orders!  The food however never again, Calamari were huge, pre frozen rings (see Costco ) not fried well at all, chewy and bad flavor, marinara sauce was horrible. Dinners were ok, best was the sweet potato ravioli my daughter had, rest were 2 star at best, I had the grilled lamb chops bought from Costco, I know because I've bought them their too not worth the $28.00. Desserts were good, best was the limoncello  Flute.  Worst was watching a couple try to get a table for at least an hour as the hostess said they were waiting for our table to leave? Excuse Me!! There were tables open, and when it was 1st told to this couple we were just getting our dinners!  To write a review you need to place a star, if I had a choice it would be 0 stars. It I guess the Ravioli and dessert deserve 1 star!!  If you are looking for a local great Italian restaurant do go here!!  UPDATE: 2/26/17, I was threatened by the stepdad of the hostess, he felt my comments were wrong,I asked him if he was threatening all the people who had an issue with her or just me?? No response! Moral here is there are crazy people out there so be careful, this is no joke and Rick the owner of LaStalla could care less that a customer has been threatened by an employees family!!",

    "text": "They should rename this place to \"la little portions cucina rustica.\" I was with the family looking for a nice sit down restaurant in chandler. We came in for a late lunch and were seated promptly.  To tell you the truth, we realized that the place was understaffed since there was only 1 waitress with at least 5-6 tables. It took forever to get our orders in, get us water and then the appetizers finally arrive but she forgets to bring us plates so we can't start eating. I feel for the waitress but the manager really should have staffed better especially when your patrons are starving.   I would have left this at a 3 star review given the situation if it wasn't for the food. My hubby and I ordered the squid ink seafood pasta which was actually pretty tasty but so tiny in portion size. The family had ordered 2 pizzas as well to share which were thin like paper and not cheap. I felt like I had to fight for my food!  Overall, the experience just left a bad taste in my mouth and did not give me the classy restaurant vibe I had gotten when I walked into the place. Call me a snob, but I expect decent portions and decent service if we are dropping $20 a person on food.",

The staff is amateur hour at best, inconsistent, and sometimes outright strange.   Music is completely inappropriate- Tonight's choices were comprised of bad 70's mustache rock songs.   The cooks don't really know what they're doing either. Lasagna was a strange overly salty cheesy mess. Pizza was a salty disaster too- Salty sausage, salty olives, salty capers, and salty prosciutto? Are you kidding me? Why? Why would anyone do that? Why would you put all of that on the same pizza? And why the hell did I order it? I've tried a couple other rather unremarkable dishes too. That's enough for me. I'll try to find another Italian place in the area.   Oh, the prices are absurd for the entrees as well.",

My friend ordered the eggplant orecchiette, which was pretty good. I got the squid in pasta and man, was it everything I wanted in pasta that night. The garlic wasn't overbearing and everything complemented the seafood so well. The seafood, besides the shrimp, were well prepared. And even though the shrimp was overcooked a little it was still delicious.  I wish for the price you could have gotten a small house salad or something, but the pasta dishes weren't too unreasonable. And for how much pasta I got, I feel it was worth the 19 dollars I spent. I took half home and ate it two more meals. They have free bread too which is perfect. Soft and warm on the insides and crusty on the outside.  My one real complaint is that even though it wasn't very busy, service took a while to get drinks on the table and such. Plus, we had three different people coming to our table so if I asked one person for something, or server would come back and not know we were waiting.  All in all, I'd like to go this place again the next time I'm in Arizona.",

Both the salad and entree were delicious!  The gnocchi was particularly interesting as I hadn't had cheese in gnocchi before.  If you haven't had gnocchi before, be forewarned that it is a very rich and filling dish.  I took at least half of it home with me.  It heated up well for lunch the next day.  My friends ordered the Calamari Fritti appetizer and I have to say that it didn't look too special.  Everything else looked great though, and there were certainly no complaints at our table.  There is a small selection of desserts on the menu, but we were all so full that we couldn't partake.  I definitely need to come back to try other menu items including the Prosciutto e Melon.

The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is that I felt it was a bit expensive (i.e $16 for a vegetarian pasta dish). However, this place only had one other large table of people-all speaking Italian and having a great time. I had a penne pasta with roasted tomato sauce, eggplant (which I normally hate), mozzarella and parmesan cheese.  The bread is worth eating a bit of-as it is warm, authentic italian style bread. I couldn't stop eating the pasta-the portions are on the big side-which helped me accept the higher prices. I ate half and it was great the next day as well. Wonderful wine selections...great service. This place is a True representation of good italian food-I would recommend it to ANYONE-especially those who agree that Olive Garden does NOT qualify as authentic italian food.",

While it took a little time for any server to appear, despite the fact that they were not very busy, the food definitely made up for any delays.    We started with the Cozze e Vongole Saltate - tender sauteed clams and mussels in a delicious garlic broth.  (The female busser keep us well plied with bread to sop up the flavorful broth - but be careful not to fill up too much on bread!)  The salads (Insalata Mediterranea & Insalata Pugliese) were excellent due to the fresh mesclun greens, wonderful cheeses and high quality balsamic and olive oil.  We all had different variations of veal - Saltimbocca alla Romana (tender scallopine with prosciutto in a rich buttery sauce), Vitello alla Griglia (an expertly grilled marinated veal chop - basic but exquisite), and Involtini di Vitello (mozzarella and prosciutto wrapped in veal with a rich sherry sauce with sauteed mushrooms).  The Involtini was especially terrific and our server's favorite recommendation as well.  The vegetables that come with the dinners are also quite good - a melange of carrots, red potatoes, cabbage.  Even though we had finished our veal, we thought about bringing the extra vegetables home!    I am always looking for places that are kid-friendly that are not chains.  They were very accommodating to the 10 month old we brought with us, too.  Save room (or take home) the tiramisu: it is unbelievable!  Cappuccino was even noteworthy.  Despite the typos in the menu (pet peeve of mine) and even PRINTED on the beautiful wall of the restaurant (i.e. \"receipes\") - (*gasp* - okay,  HUGE pet peeve of mine), La Stalla Cucina Rustica is a welcome star in a slew of mediocre Italian restaurants in the valley.",

Our waitress was a loon, Fredriko or something like that. Not sure she was in the moment. Appetizer was slapped on a plate. Silverware was missing. Stupid paper covering the tablecloth cut my son's finger. Really hard chairs. I was crippled by the end of the night. Good wine and bread, when you can get it. Come on, get on track. This was one weird meal.",

    "text": "Looking for some great \"homemade\" style Italian food close to home, I checked out Yelp for suggestions. I saw this my husband and I figured we'd try it for lunch. It was a shame that the place was nearly empty, but it was a Sunday afternoon and figure most were still in Church and the like. Being one of the few tables few did provide for amazing service. We shared a lunch Caesar salad, which was easily big enough to be a meal for the both of us with freshly shaved Parmesan on top- so yummy! I had a Margarita pizza, which for the price, was huge and my husband had the Chicken Parm on foccicia- SO GOOD and super filling. I've not had pizza that tasted so authentically Italian since being in Venice! We walked out for less than 25 dollars, a great deal! We'll be back for sure, just sorry we hadn't found it sooner!",

Second of all I ordered a dirty martini and it was served in what appeared to be a miniature martini glass for $9. Now to the food....my husband and I both ordered the specials that were recommended which were osso buco and monk fish. The monk fish could have been cod for all I know it was completely drenched in a heavy vodka cream sauce and was chewy. I could not take more than one bite. The osso buco did not have any flavor and was FAR from falling off the bone and tender. The server did not offer any apologies about the monk fish that I did not eat, nor did she offer any sort of discount or substitution. So, 2 entrees and 3 drinks later the bill was $110 and I was hungry when I left.  This was the worst experience at a restaurant that I can remember, and it is a shame because as I said, the decor was amazing.",

The waiter was excellent, knowing exactly what to say and do at all times, and the food was very good.  Sometimes I'm disappointed in pasta dishes at Italian restaurants; often they seem to taste better the next day after the flavors have had time to meld, but the Penne alla Norma was very tasty.  The wine was good, although I could not finish the large amount poured, but at least I felt I wasn't being ripped off.    Nice atmosphere.  I look forward to trying this place out again, possibly for take-out lunch when the prices are a little lower.",

But I could barely find them on the plate because they were drowned in a heavy overpowering sauce. My husband had the lasagna which was decent and I honestly had more of that then my entree. For what we had, it was totally overpriced. I could imagine Olive Garden would be just as good.",

    "text": "I took my girlfriend to La Stalla for her birthday dinner last night, and we had an excellent experience.   The tasty complimentary bread was properly warm, good and crusty on the outside but soft inside. Olive oil's on the table, and you pour it yourself. I confess I prefer to have the server pour the oil, but maybe I am spoiled.   I ordered a 2006 Sangiovese (#411 on the wine list) that our server bought out promptly. It was inexpensive at $40, but very decent for the price.   The bruschetta was very good, with the right amount of oil. I despise bruschetta that is so crunchy that the tomatoes go flying about the room when you take a bite. La Stalla's was excellent.   My girlfriend had the Gorgonzola and sweet potato ravioli in cream sauce. I sampled a bit, and it was delicious (and I don't even like sweet potatoes!). She enjoyed it a great deal.   I had the tortelloni aurora, with cheese, veal and prosciutto in a pink sauce. It wasn't *quite* as fabulous as my girlfriend's entree, but was very, very good nonetheless.   We finished by sharing a creme brulee, which was also very good, though not particularly distinguished from any good creme brulee.   The atmosphere was excellent, with the room full of adults and no screaming kids underfoot. The music was at volume appropriate to conversation, and the goldfish in the little pond behind our table were very polite.  Most people were dressed casually but not sloppily.  The service was EXCELLENT. Our waitress was clearly intelligent and perceptive, and attentive without being obtrusive. For example, when she noticed the girlfriend and I having a fun conversation, she politely asked if we wanted out entrees to come out quickly, or if we wanted to linger over our appetizer and wine a bit. She was quick with recommendations, had a ready smile, and served everything very efficiently.   In all, it was about $120 with (a fairly generous, based on the excellent service) tip. I think the experience was worth every penny.",

    "text": "We went to La Stalla on a Saturday night. It's a warm, cozy restaurant that appears to attract an older crowd. Reservations were not needed.  First, the bread you get to start seems commercially made. It's really unremarkable and not worth eating on it's own (or with the balsamic they give you). Instead, hold onto it and use it to mop up the sauce from your entree.  Second, during the summer they have a pre-fixe menu. If you're on a budget, one person can get the pre-fixe and the other just an entree and you'll have more than enough food. It's three courses and a glass of wine, so it was a great deal.  Third, prices online appear to be lower than in the restaurant (although I could be wrong; it just seems cheaper online than what we saw at the restaurant).  We did just that--pre fixe and entree-- and started with a generous caprese salad. Thick slices of tomatos and mozzarella. It was delicious.  Next, hubby got the tagliatelle alla toscana. It was really just average. Instead, you should get the sweet potato ravioli. Eat just three of your six three-bite pods, and use that bread you've been saving to fill up on the sauce (after all, the cream sauce won't be nearly as yummy the next day!).  We finished with the cannoli, which weren't overly sweet. Two small lemon-ricotta filled (we couldn't taste the white chocolate) ones.",

We had made reservations and our table was waiting for us when we arrived.  My husband ordered the fettucine, which was by far the best dish at the table.  They make their own pasta at this place, so the fettucine noodles were purple and had the white sauce (awesome by the way) topped with pine nuts and sliced cherry tomatoes.  I had a dish, which was the special, and while it was cooked well, it wasn't as fantastic as the fettucine dish, just my preference, not digging on the dish itself.  The others at the table ordered the lasagna, which was a pretty big portion, and it was delicious as well.  We had wine and an italian beer called Moretti La Rossa.  The beer was so good, we went to Total Wine a few days later and got a couple of 6 packs.  We were there into the end of the evening (10 pm), so our server asked if we'd like some homemade almond liqueur, and we said yes.  It was fantastic!!  It came in a little shot glass and was so very wonderful.  We thought they were going to charge us for these, but they didn't.  It was a sort of pricey place, but so very worth the great food, and we were prepared to pay since it was a birthday celebration. A special place to dine for sure.  I'd been here on other occasions and the food was good, but they must have upped their game since then, as they went from 4 stars to 5 stars.",

The two times I had seafood with the pasta I got sick. Like almost food poisoning sick.   Normally I would not have gone back after the first time but my wife loves the atmosphere here. So after 6 months or so I would give in and give La Stalla another try. The seafood appetizer did not sit well with her this last time so we won't be going back again for another try in 6 months.   This place is busy when the resort is full and not so busy other times so maybe we were just unlucky and got some old seafood.  The problem I had with the non-seafood dishes I tried is that they were just OK and you can get just OK Italian food in Chandler at several other places for 1/2 what this place charges.

It's basically veal wrapped around a core of prosciutto and mozzarella and served in a sherry sauce.  It just wasn't a good choice.  The vegetables that accompanied the dish were fine, but I was a little put out to see \"baby carrots.\"  For one thing, they're not really baby carrots, they're just big carrots whittled down to little nubs and sold in bags.  And for another, I've had those in my lunch every day for the last two weeks, so you'll understand if I'm dismayed to see them make a cameo on my dinner plate at an not-inexpensive Italian restaurant.  My wife had the lasagne, which is usually a good bet.  It tasted fine and our super picky 8 year old had a bite when we got home and loved it.  I should have gone with my gut, which was to order the steak.  Or maybe the Tagliolini allo Scoglio.  The wine list has a reasonable, if small, number of wines available by the glass.  I tried a sangiovese, cab, merlot blend - it was just OK.  For desert, we had the lemon gelato swirled with limoncello.  This was very good.

We were seated promptly when our waitress came over to introduce herself...Fredriko! I must say I was a little leary as one of the previous reviews had commented on the bad service she received from this waitress. Lucky for us Fredriko was very friendly and efficient.   The menu is rather extensive so plan being a bit more descive that day or you'll stare at for a long time. We started with a house salad and enjoyed the complementary bread. The bread was crusty and bit chewy, just like I like it. I found the olive oil to be a little awkward to pour but I soon got over it when I tasted the combination. I had a craving for fish and wanted to know just how fresh it was. Fredriko told me the fish is frozen fresh and brought in daily. I had the Bavette con Vongole - Bavette pasta with clams in a light clam sauce. The sauce was very light in consistency and had a nice smooth flavor to it with just the right amount of garlic. Jill T. ordered the Tortelloni Aurora - Prosciutto & veal filled tortelloni with diced prosciutto cotto & peas in a pink sauce. Jill T. let me try her dish and I think it was even better than my Bavette con Vongole. We ended the meal with a nice dessert that I haven't seen at any of the Italian restaurants I frequent - Fruta di bosco con Zabaione. The dessert was good but a little to potent for our liking.  I'm looking forward to trying their happy hour!",

The bread was good, but they served it with a cup of balsamic vinegar. The olive oil on the table was in a store bought container that had obviously been left open for a long period of time (the label was greasy and not legible). My chicken Parmesan was chewy, flavorless, and not crisp in the slightest. My boyfriends face when he bit into his eggplant rollatini was by far the saddest part of the entire meal. It had no prosciutto, and tasted like it had been sitting in the back of a freezer for months. Neither of us received the pasta we requested, and the waitress couldn't tell the difference between Ragu and marinara. The pasta was sitting in a oily watery soup with the sauce just thrown on top. All around terrible. I took my leftovers home because I didn't want to be rude to the wait staff, but I threw it right in the trash when I walked out of the restaurant. Stay away from this place.",

    "text": "La stalla is an amazing little gem, you would never know driving by but amazing authentic Italian meals. Started at the bar, because we were waiting for the rest of the party, what a great happy hour, the bartender (Cammy) I think her name was, was the best... me and my husband each had a cocktail and shared the Calamari! What a treat very different from other calamari we have tried-- more calamari litely fried! Delicious. Cammy then suggested Italian red wines to pair with our meals, try the Barbera! Then we made our way to the dining room for our dinner we had a party of 6. Nora Rae was our server she was so knowledgeable with the menu and suggested the specials! Me and my husband once again took the suggestion and she did not steer us wrong. He had the ELK SHANK! I tried the scampi risotto. When I say wow, I mean Wow. This place is our new favorite and i highly suggest it. Thethe service to the meals and especially the bread. Love love love. Will be back soon!",

The cheese inside was good, but there were no spices to be found. The cheese inside was layered in an odd way as such you didn't get the ricotta and mozzarella at the same time. Sure won't be getting this again, but might give a pie a go and see if that's any better. Meh...",

Picked this one as an alternative to my long time fave across the street that is closed on Wednesday. Associate I was meeting for biz dinner also was looking forward to the place. 5:30 rez and the place was completely empty. Intriguing menu but limited for a high end place. Glass of Chianti was warm - they brought another. Started with Calamari, which was strips instead of rings and tentacles. Chewy texture with absolutely no flavor. Boring. I ordered their top dish of Veal Medallions with a side of basic pasta with EVOO and spices. Veal had a really good sauce bit you need a steak knife to cut it. Pasta had good flavor but was cold. The bread was tasty. Associate had Fettuccine Alfredo and remarked it was OK. I'm a foodie who expects what is advertised. I don't send items back on the 1st visit. That old 'only one chance to make a first impression'  standard. I won't go back. BTW, when we left at 6:30 the place was still empty.",

The flatware was of notably good quality. The weight and balance felt great in my hands. The tables were too close together to offer any privacy. I found it hard not to overhear my neighbors conversations. Service : The service was good. I requested heavy cream for my coffee and was disappointed when the waiter told me they only had the milk without checking with the kitchen first. Food: My friend and I both ordered chicken marsala. The chicken was tough. It was hard to cut with a knife. (Overcooked?) The marsala sauce was thin and without much flavor. The steamed broccoli and carrots we're very good.  Overall I was disappointed.",

As soon as the usual Saturday night crowd arrived and the place started to fill-up, the quality of service and attention dropped off fast. No more refills on drinks and long wait to get check paid. Antipasto plate was small and overpriced and of average quality. Pasta Fagouli soup was all shells, some beans and tasted like ti came from a can. Very disappointing,. Pasta + pancetta - the pancetta was tough and gristle-y and the pesto only so-so. Would not return.",

However, upon arriving to this establishment, the women who is either the owner or manager told her host to seat us at the table by the kitchen. There were plenty of other tables open at the time. I preceded to order the caprese salad, mussels, and calamari. I do not know how you can mess up a caprese salad, but they managed to do so. The calamari was rubbery and flavorless. The mussels were salty and very mushy. When I decided to send the calamari back, the waiter told me that that is how it is supposed to taste because they just use flour when frying. I am from the coast of southern California. That is not what $13 calamari is supposed to taste like. After it was sent back, the owner or manager came to our table and tried to persuade us into thinking that our food was supposed to taste the way it did and that we didn't know what we were talking about. I assume she thought that because my friend and I are on the younger side that we do not have experience eating good food or going to a nice restaurant. Throughout our dining experience here, this women was kind and very personable with all other customers.  We felt judged the minute we walked in and received bad food and bad service because of it.

    "text": "While here in Phoenix on business, I happened upon this gem of a restaurant while staying at the Crown Plaza/Chandler Golf Resort which is across the street. The server Joe was fantastic and the staff amazing. I also happened to be here, alone on my birthday. My darling other half, found out where I was dining and conspired with the staff to to surprise me with a birthday creme brulee. Talk about going above and beyond! That is even before I can share my review of the food. I had an antipasti of prosciutto wrapped mozzarella baked under a crust of sauteed mushroom and Italian bread crumbs. Outstanding dish. I followed that with a bowl of pasta fagioli. Although the broth was thinner than the past fagiolis back in New England, the amount of flavor packed in each spoonful was delicious. My entree, Pollo a Marsalla, was great- the two butter tender chicken breasts where in a Marsala mushroom sauce that had a ton of mushrooms and absolutely spot on for flavor. The side of summer vegetables and potatoes were tender and I could have eaten just a bowl of those. The whole dish felt like something your Italian grandmother would serve. I hear their pizza is really good to... will definitely visit again while I am in town.",

We went for a birthday dinner a few nights ago and I had chicken Marsala and my husband had the special which was elk.  Neither of us have ever had elk, and we were not disappointed.  Our friend had the lasagne.  The lasagne is quite possibly the best lasagne I have ever had.  It is a large serving, big enough for two meals.  We had to finish off with dessert, so we ordered the chocolate souffle as well as creme brulee!  La Stalla is an awesome choice for a nice, relaxing Italian dinner.  It is not somewhere to run in for a quick meal. Plan to enjoy the wine, your friends and the amazing food.  A little piece of Italy right in downtown Chandler.",

She made sure we got our \"Happy Hour\" drink prices in (we arrived a half hour before Happy Hour was over) but didn't serve our wine until we were finished with the previous glass so that our white wines stayed chilled !!  She refilled our water constantly and gave us just the right amount of attention.  Food and service at La Stalla will assure that we will definitely visit again and highly recommend this restaurant !!",

It was uncomfortably hot inside so we asked the manager if she would please turn the ac on & she did so we were comfortable by the time dinner arrived. I ordered the veal, my fiance ordered the lasagna, my best friend ordered the balsamic steak, & her boyfriend ordered the lamb. His lamb was a little gamey but he still enjoyed it, & the rest of us were very happy with our meals. As far as entrees, the calamari wasn't the best (missing that crunch I like) but the prosciutto with assorted cheese was really good. I'd definitely go back if I'm in the neighborhood again.",

While the food was still as good as ever, the new location lacks the charm and cozy feel of the last location.

Something has gone terribly wrong with this place and the move to their new location. We will not be back.",

The pizza was pretty tasty and good portion for the lunch special price of $8. However, the japanese sweet potato ravioli, eventhough also tasty, but portion size was terribly disappointing for the price we paid--$14. There were exactly 5 small pieces of it! The good taste couldn't make up for the small amount of food. Lastly, the squid ink pasta was a good portion, taste was ok but plain, nothing exotic about it. Pretty disappointed with the experience.   Bread was supposedly fresh baked daily but ours came cold, another disappointment. Did not taste like warm fresh baked bread to us at all.   Service was ok, but could be better. Server left the wine list menu laying flat on our table the entire time and even place a plate of sliced lemons on it instead of removing it.",

    "text": "Can't help but feel let down after eating at La Stalla last Friday night, especially after all the positive reviews. I have to say that the best thing about this place was the location and drinks. Here's how I would break it down:  Location: 4 stars Price: 2 stars Food: 2 stars Drinks: 4 stars Service: 2.5 stars  First of all, we got here around 6pm on a Friday night and we were probably one of three couples and a large party. Basically, this place wasn't super busy.   Our waitress was very friendly and kept checking back at the perfect times. But the waitress didn't make up for the near one hour wait time for a single plate of pasta, which even the waitress admitted was long.  After waiting that long for the pasta you would think the noodles would be done but they were still pretty chewy. In addition to the pasta we also got the antipasto, which was three types of meats and three types of cheeses and two olives. It wasn't served with any nuts/fruits/jams or breads, so we used the leftover bread we had from when we first walked in.   I do have to say the drinks were absolutely fantastic - definitely one of the few positives. We had a mixture of cocktails and wine and they both were amazing.  Lastly, the thing that really made our mind up about La Stalla was the price. For two people we ordered a single plate of pasta, the antipasto, and two drinks for both of us and the bill was an astounding $95 after tip. Definitely not recommended when you compare the food for the price.",

I honestly don't know how they receive a 4 stars overall rating.   Since I am a big supporter of the local restaurants, we figure we would give this place a try. Hostess was friendly to us, but our server was horrible. She is a older short blonde hair lady & another waitress was following her all night (possibly a trainee). When she came over twice to take our order for drinks and entrees, she made me repeat myself multiple times and gave me a puzzle look as though she didn't understand the word that was coming out of my mouth. I honestly felt discriminated. I began speaking much louder and I think she eventually got the point. We asked for more bread (only once) and she gave us an attitude & appeared to be annoyed. The whole experience made us feel horrible.   For entree, we ordered a lasagna and a spaghetti. They were both average. We probably would have come here to try something else again if it wasn't for the attitude we received.   If you want great service, don't come here. I personality will not ever come here again.",

    "text": "I came in there once on Valentine's day which happened to be Friday, the restaurant was packed, so I didn't get seated and decided to come back.   The actual visit was such a disappointment. The bread was served cold, it wasn't even warm. The very sad lasagna was cold in the middle, seems like it was thawed before serving. The lasagna wasn't impressive, tomato sauce was too sweet, and not enough meat. Sweet potato ravioli in gorgonzola sauce were interesting, but not interesting enough to pay $21 for six raviolis: sweet potatoes were too sweet, the dish was lukewarm, not hot. Olive oil on the table tasted stale, their balsamic vinegar gave me a heartburn (I have better one at home).  The decor is outdated.   The server, Dennis, tried to play a role of a server from a better restaurant than La Stalla is; I prefer more authentic and genuine attitude. But more importantly, I prefer my food served hot, especially on Monday evenings, when they have only few tables seated.  Three-star Buca di Beppo, being a chain, has more ambiance, more flavor in their Italian dishes than this downtown Chandler 'gem'. Needless to say, servers at Buca were always more delightful than \"I am going to act arrogant, so they'll think this is high-end restaurant\" attitude. It makes me really wonder how this place stays in business and get such high reviews!",

The caprese salad had homemade mozzarella cheese and delicious ripe tomatoes. The margarita pizza had 8 slices on homemade dough with basil and dripping with fresh mozzarella. Delicious! We also ordered the mussels in garlic sauce served with fresh Italian bread. We ordered a tiramisu that was the best I've ever had. Our server/ bartender Cami was attentive and offered menu suggestions. She was personable, friendly and knowledgeable. This place is a gem with great service! Great prices as well.",

    "text": "Well I hate to be the bearer of bad news ,but I had an awful experience here and it makes me hesitant to EVER go back despite the good reviews for dinner and dessert.  I went for lunch with my husband. I wanted to see the menu first but he wanted to just go for it.  It's very cute inside, I Loved the Mediterranean/Romantic feel with lighted orange trees and faux rock walls, wood beams and rustic chairs.  I HATE paper table cloths, as they are prone to giving paper cuts and always make me think of Macaroni Grille.  I was not feelin' the menu but decided to try one of their Focaccia Panini's with grilled chicken, tomato, avocado and spinach. My husband ordered pasta with Tuscan meat sauce.  First we were served flat diet coke and some day old bread.......sigh.....  Good rustic bread is sometimes chewy and maybe even tough, but never just crumbles the way this bread did...maybe it was more than day old?  My sandwich arrived and looked OK (notice no picture) After one bite I knew it wasn't good, but I took a few more just to make sure.   The spinach looked to be from a can or frozen, it was really mushy and the green color was looking really more of a brownish.  My husband's pasta was piping  hot and he said it was OK also but had a weird taste to the meat..??  SO I didn't eat anymore of mine and when the waitress/manager/hostess came over I told her why (spinach and just overall not good) She insisted it was Fresh..............Honey Please!   Maybe last week when they sauteed it but now it was a soggy mess.  I Love spinach and I assure you there is NO WAY that spinach was fresh at any time during the last week!  My Husband says I need to YELP on my own time!  2 stars for the decor",

Chef Ivan Ruiz is extremely dedicated to his craft, and puts together a wonderfully diverse menu.  Owner, Paul, is friendly and welcoming and creates a great atmosphere for his customers.

    "text": "\"Old World Italy in Chandler, AZ\" sounds like the set up for a joke.  You wouldn't expect to find one of the best Italian restaurants in metro Phoenix located in downtown Chandler, but that's the case with La Stalla Cucina Rustica.   The decor clearly conveys the Old World focus of the restaurant.  From the wood tables and chairs to the faux finished walls and the hand painted murals, this place is evocative of rural Italy.  If you've traveled throughout Italy, the atmosphere at La Stalla won't magically transport you back, but you will appreciate the elements that have been gathered together to bring a bit of the old school Italian vibe to downtown Chandler.  After all, that's no small feat.   The food is traditional and consistently good.  Don't come here for cutting-edge Italian, but for the classics.  For appetizers, the Calamari Fritti ($12) features crispy calamari and a spicy marinara sauce.  I do not order calamari because it's usually not fresh in Arizona, but it's a favorite of my dear friend who lives in Chandler and the La Stalla version is pretty good.  The Pasta e Fagioli soup ($6) is True to the classic and features tender cannellini beans and pasta.  They sometimes feature an appetizer special of stuffed mushrooms that are baked in their brick oven and they are fantastic.  For pasta dishes, the Tortelloni Panna Proscuitto e Piselli ($18) includes tortelloni pasta with ham and peas in a cheese cream sauce.  It's unbelievably rich.  We're talking heart attack on a plate rich, but it's darn tasty.  Spaghetti alla Carbonara ($18) is another True-to-form old school dish.  It features spaghetti with smoked pancetta in a parmesan egg cream sauce.  The BF enjoys the Risotto Agli Scampi ($19) that combines baby shrimp and arborio rice.  In the entree category, Involtini di Vitello ($23) is the favorite of my Chandler friend.  It features mozzarella and prosciutto wrapped in veal and pan seared in a sherry sauce.  Personally, I avoid this dish due to the veal.  I'm starting to come around to veal and will try it as soon as I find a restaurant that offers True free range veal.  Be sure to ask about the specials because they are often excellent and even the vegetables served alongside many of the entrees are perfectly seasoned.   Here's an admonition to La Stalla and other spendy Italian restaurants in Phoenix:  Grated parmesan cheese (even Parmigiano Reggiano) is not a controlled substance.  It's cheese, not crack.  Please do not make a huge deal out of spooning out the tiniest amount for me on top of my soup or pasta.  When I ask for grated cheese, just leave me a small bowl at the table to use at my discretion.  You can trust me to not bring a Ziploc bag to steal what I don't use during my dinner.  If the cost of the cheese is an issue, then tack a dollar or two onto each dish and be done with it because the food cost of the cheese should already be factored into your prices.  The cost of the grated cheese at La Stalla should not be an issue because the price point of the menu has risen noticeably in the past year.  For desserts, the standout is the Fruta di bosco con Zabaione ($9).  It's a mix of seasonal berries topped with Grand Marnier Zabaione sauce.  I always marvel at the perfect, beautiful berries that La Stalla manages to source at all times.  The Zabaione sauce is generously flavored with Grand Marnier and sugar and it's whipped up to a delightfully fluffy texture.  It's flat out fantastic!  The Chocolate \"Souffle\" ($10) is more of a molten chocolate cake than a True chocolate souffle that you would find at Christopher's.  However, it's the favorite of my Chandler friend, so it often gets ordered.  If you're lucky, you will be offered a shot of the housemade Limoncello to finish off your meal.  It's popular and they often run out, but it is the perfect end to a meal at La Stalla.  La Stalla is a bit spendy.  Dinner for two can easily near $100 with appetizers, soups/salads, pasta dishes or entrees, desserts, drinks, tax and tip. The quality is definitely worth the expense, but this is not your inexpensive neighborhood Italian joint.  As my Italian Grandmothers would say, \"Mange! Mange!\"",

Not only that, the shrimp was king-size and the waitress recommended an excellent white wine that complimented my dish real well. Forgot the name of it though! However, my husband ordered the Tortelloni Aurora and we both agreed it was awful.   They have a fresh dessert menu, but we didn't try any of the dessert options because we were full from the bread and food.   The highlight of our time there was definitely the great ambiance and interior decor!   They have limited menu selections and one of our dishes wasn't so appetizing, so we give this place a 3 out of 5.",

Still, I was in the mood for a different spot and Italian cuisine sounded good so I thought we'd give it a try.  I had the Penne alla Vodka.  Let's just say, my plate was clean at the end.  My experience with the service was really good. The only hiccup during our visit is that the glass of wine the person I was with ordered had little bits of cork in it.  I mentioned it to our server and they quickly apologized and replaced it.  No harm done!  We finished off having the tiramisu for dessert.

    "text": "Food-wise, I'd give the place another star, but the waitress ruined it for me. La Stalla is located across from the historic San Marcos hotel. It is a very intimate place, bordering sappy-romantic, Italian restaurant.  I dined here for a business talk with  possible clients (two awesome children's book authors, by the way). They love this place and I don't blame them.  The food is excellent! I had the gnocchi with tomato sauce, topped with slices of fresh mozarella. It wasn't the most divine gnocchi I've ever tasted, but it was certainly delectable. I wished the gnocchis were a little less play-do like (not that I've ever tasted play-do) and a bit more pillowy. Can't complain about the sauce.  One of my dining partners had chicken soup, which seemed the perfect food for that rainy evening. The other had the chicken marsala, which was devoured heartily. The heavily sauced plate was wiped clean with fresh-baked bread and olive oil. Yes, it's that good!  Oh, and the pinot noir from the Russian River area was superb. it was delicate and the aroma was not overwhelming...just the way I prefer.  Here's the problem : KIM. She was our waitress and I think she really should take a lesson about \"when to butt in without being rude.\" Don't get me wrong, she was attentive...in fact too attentive, bordering rude. Remember that this was a business dinner meeting so we had a lot of topics to cover, and KIM managed to butt in at anttime stopping the momentum of what I and my possible clients were discussing. It was flat out annoying. I would be in a middle of a sentence, and she would blurt out, \"care for some more bread, are you doing alright?\" Don't you think that she should've waited for the window of pause and ask that question when that arose?!!!  Well, I didn't finish my pasta dish because KIM kept asking evey 10 minutes if I was done with my meal. Annoying!  Anyway, I highly recommend the place because of their food. But by golly, run out the door if the waitress introduces her self as KIM.",

La Stalla is in the heart of historic Downtown Chandler, kitty-corner to the San Marcos hotel.   Here's my recommendation for the perfect dinner, ala a night in Venice, without leaving the Valley:  Start with the Bocconcini al Prosciutto, prosciutto-wrapped mozzarella topped with mushrooms and breadcrums.   Contadino focaccia, with grilled eggplant, roasted peppers, with mozzarella, mesculine and tomatoes, drizzled with a balsamic olive oil dressing.  Penne alla Vodka, al dente penne pasta in a delicate vodka-cream sauce.   Finish off with fresh fruit zabaione or (maybe and?) chocolatte souffle. You'll have to allow an extra 10-15 minutes for the souffle, but it comes straight out of the oven.  Delizioso!",

    "text": "We dined here last night and were very impressed with the place. We made a reservation and I'm glad we did because it was pretty busy when we arrived; however, we spied a bar where people seemed to be waiting. The decor is nice and the place is homey and comfortable without being cramped. I don't think there really is a bad table in the house.   Service was excellent, friendly and very knowledgable about the menu and wine list. The wine list was impressive with some very unique offerings. We ordered a lovely bottle of white and I love that our waiter brought the ice bucket without having to be asked. Little touches like that make this a lovely place. (I also love any Italian restaurant that doesn't have the words \"meatball\", \"spaghetti\" and \"marinara\" on it; all these words are wonderfully absent)  I had the pappardelle mari e monti which was a spinach pasta served with scallops and a porcini tomato sauce. It was excellent. The pasta was cooked very well and still had a bite. The scallops were well done and the sauce, with burst cherry tomatoes and porcini mushrooms complimented the scallops beautifully.   My husband had the squid ink pasta which is a fairly new item on their menu, we learned. The seafood was all cooked very well and the pasta was again properly cooked with a nice bite. The flavors were good but my husband was hoping for more of a distinctive flavor from the squid ink.   We will definitely be coming back to enjoy their brick oven pizzas which looked excellent and their chocolate souffle.",

We were seated quickly, really no need for reservations when we went anyway.   We ordered the bruschetta for appetizer. It was pretty awesome, I wish more for of that at least. I ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables. I was surprised at the portion of the salmon was pretty decent. It was well seasoned and flaked perfectly. The vegetables were quite seasoned i must say, I focused on my salmon more so. Overall I enjoyed my entree. As for my friend, he ordered the Penne alla Norma. First bite, he stops mid-bite and  says \"OMG, this is good!\" I had to laugh. I agreed, it was pretty tasty.  Dessert was tiramasu, which was pretty nice as well. Although I wished the marscapone cheese was distributed throughout rather than be the first thing one digs into. I was had to shovel out the yummy lady fingers.  we debated at the end of dinner. I said it was pretty good, but not awesome. Not that I would go running back for more. I would definitely try again, but you won't see me running. The other menu items still look delectably pleasing.",

Nice atmosphere and a welcoming staff.  It literally feels like you are hanging at a friends home.  Our server was having a bit of an \"off\" night.

Surprisingly they were not busy so we were seated immediately. I'd recommend this place for a special occasion dinner when you have time to enjoy a meal at a leisurely pace. We were brought fresh slices of bread and the olive oil was already on the table but strangely we didn't have any balsamic vinegar. I ordered the Ravioli Di Patate Dolci Giapponesi Al Gorgonzola which is a Japanese sweet potato pasta in a Gorgonzola cheese cream sauce. The ravioli was delicious and the to-die-for sauce rich & creamy!",

It was delicious also, light dish and the flavors worked well together. The sweet sausage was excellent. It is hard to find good sausage. I had the limoncello for dessert. It was cool and refreshing. The lemon had just the right amount of tartness. My only wish is that it was more creamy and less icy. My mother had the creme brulee. The custard was perfect, but the crust was burnt. She liked it that way; I do not. The service was very friendly. The restaurant was clean and the decor was very pretty. I felt like I was in Tuscany. We will definitely be going back.

The table shared a couple of Caprese Salad's...there was one single leaf of basil in the center of the plate.  The tomato's were dark pink (if we can get bright red tomato's in Minneapolis in the winter, why can't they get ripe tomato's in Chandler?).  Again...it was ok, but I expected more.  I had a \"primevera\" salad that was comprised of mixed greens, apples, orange, and grapefruit with a creamy raspberry dressing, but it was saturated in blue cheese crumbles that completely overtook the salad.    My entree was a broiled halibut and came with a generous portion of mixed vegetables that were overcooked.  The halibut was simple and tasty, but it was also tiny - probably the smallest portion of halibut I've ever been served.  I had a nice glass of Pinot Noir; the only one they served by the glass on the menu.  So, all in all...it was ok.  I wouldn't even think of driving out of my way to go there again though.",

    "text": "Definitely worth it. The decor is lovely and it is a good atmosphere. But the important part is the food. This is probably as good as Phoenix can get; it will never be amazing Italian - the cooks can't go to a nearby dairy and get fresh cheese, they can't go to a local butcher and handpick the meats, and I doubt they have the time to make the pasta by hand - all of which they do in Italy. But that being  said, they did a good job with the ingredients that they have access to and everything was fine. Better than Olive Garden, and isn't that what you're looking for? The staff is not effusive in greetings, but definitely not rude. Our server, an older gentleman, was courteous and friendly and spot on the service. Plate used? Replaced? Fork used? Replaced. New dishes for every course, perfect. And frankly, if you go during happy hour with half off appetizers (REAL appetizers, not cheapo fried stuff - options like calamari, mussels, antipasto, bruchetta, etc) life was pretty darn good.",

First, the decor is very cute, classy, and welcoming (although I don't like paper table cloths either).   Our group of 4 came at 7pm on a Saturday night, and it was pretty slow. Disappointing, but it is Chandler.....   Now I don't usually do pasta since I watch my figure, but I was looking forward to trying a new dish. The bread that comes out was good, but seemed bland with just the olive oil. We got one small basket for the 4 of us, and had to ask for more with our meals. I hate asking for more bread (does that make us seem like pigs?), and wish it would have been offered.....but I get it, it's free and the free shouldn't be abused.   So my husband and I started with the caprese salad, which was just okay. We asked for a side of balsamic to flavor things up a bit, but it never arrived. I went with the Gnocchi, which was absolutely delicious and absolutely a very fattening dish. The gnocchi was stuffed with cheese, followed by a creamy tomato sauce and chunks of mozzarella. The men of the group had the lasagna, and raved. The pizza looked pretty tasty too.   Overall, we just weren't all that impressed, especially for the price and the sophisticated vibe that came up short.",

I am assuming that is why it was dead, the courts and offices in downtown Chandler were closed.    The hostess/waitress was very friendly and helpful.  She let us taste a couple wines before deciding on ours, and the pours were generous.  We started with Brucchetta that was only 3 pieces to the order, so if you have a party of 4 you are screwed.  The tomato/basil topping was fresh and delish.   I ordered Butternut Squash ravioli in a cream sauce.  It was soooo good, although there was too much cream sauce poured on top, my ravioli were buried.  But they tasted soooo good.  My sis had penne pasta with tomato sauce and zucchini.  It was very good, but HUGE portions!  She boxed it up so we could have dessert.  We chose the chocolate souffle that was served with vanilla ice cream.  It was so rich and decadent!  It went perfectly with our Illy coffee and cream!  I can't wait to take my husband here!  I want to go back for dinner because they have gnocchi!  They do have a great $5 weekday lunch menu with cold or hot sandwiches and pizza.",

The veal was basically the consistency of a rubber shoe bottom, my dinner date even noticed and commented on my chewing and asked me what I was eating.  Then he chocked when he saw the bill, \"that was $25!?\"  The lasagna was nothing special.  It was something reheated and the parts had all shifted around leading to inconsistency.

That just about describes our whole time.  We loved the location of this restaurant too.  It was right in the heart of Chandler.  Tablecloths were on all the tables, it was clean and inviting.  The menu was a little different than other Italian restaurants but staff was willing to make changes as we ordered.  Everything was perfect.  Food came out on time and we were left to talk with friends for as long as we wanted.  Fantastic!",

This is the only restaurant that I have been to in the Phoenix area that understands the ambiance of a True Mediterranean style dining. They even fly in seafood from the Mediterranean! Paolo takes being a chief to an artform. There is not a restaurant even close to the Paolo's devine creations. By far the best food and authentic family-style dining in Phoenix.",

My husband out of the squid ink pasta with tomato and garlic sauce. He absolutely loved it!    I would definitely come back here again.

    "text": "This is a pretty small Italian restaurant directly across from the Crown Plaza San Marcos Resort.    The interior was nice.  It had stone walls and nice lighting.  I could have done without the obviously fake orange trees, but over all it was clean and cozy.  It took a little while for my server to come to my table.  Once he arrived he was friendly and helpful.  He recommended a few dishes.  He kept my drink refilled and check on me often.  Overall the service was good.  The meal had a great start with some fresh and hot rustic bread that was server with balsamic vinegar and olive oil.    I ordered the Bocconcini all Prosciutto appetizer which is baked fresh mozzarella cheese wrapped in prosciutto top with mushrooms and bread crumbs.  It sounds great, but was just okay.  I would try something else.  For my main dish ordered the Saltinbocca alla Romana which is veal medallions topped with mozzarella and prosciutto (I know too much like the appetizer).  The veal medallions were great and the vegetables were good.  I thought there was a little too much fresh parsley over the dish.  One of biggest complaints I have is about their menu.  I would have like to be able to order a pasta and main dish together since I was dining alone (being across from a Hotel I would assume they get a lot of parties of 1).    Instead all their pastas come alone and their entrees come with vegetables (which were good).",

We stumbled upon La Stalla, one of nearly 20 restaurants in the downtown area.  Jeez, are we glad we did!  From the easy parking, excellent service, complimentary bread service, dynamic menu, delicious entrees & reasonable pricing, we were relieved we made that right choice.  We enjoyed a specialty pizza & size-able Mediterranean salad for $25! We learned that 'the Rustic Kitchen Stall' has been in operation for 13 years; we weren't surprised by their success!",

Literally overnight, the decision was made and sadly the sign that was left on the door to inform long time customers was removed. Anyway...  Same great atmosphere, same great people and good taste of Italian food. Most of the furniture and even the brick oven made it to the new location!  It is a longer drive for us from Mesa but we'll pay regular visits!",

The only thing I liked, honestly, was the bread and the wine.   We had the prosciutto fresh mozzarella dish and it was greasy, bland, salty and just bad. Our main dishes were the spaghetti carbonara, and it was such an Americanized \"past with alfredo sauce\" version of it. Very cheesey and creamy and way overpowering smoked pancetta. It was truly awful.  And at $16 or $18 a plate, hardly worth it and far from what traditional pasta carbonara should be. I'm not sure why restaurants use a cheesy alfredo sauce for carbonara, when it should be egg used for the consistency, not gobs of cheesy sauce. Bleh!  The atmosphere, wine and bread were good, but I can get that at home. Was sorely disappointed and felt the regret of spending $80 on a totally mediocre to bad experience with the food.  I have yet to find good Italian food in the Phoenix area. The closest thing is the new Italian Restaurant by Chris Bianco. Meatballs to die for!",

We started with the bruschetta (the waitress unfortunately pronounced it wrong, poor training by the management) and it was definitely the best I've had in a long time, actually, since Italy. Bravo!  I ordered the lasagne, and I know it is not a freshly made pasta dish, but I can make most of the other ones at home but I'm too lazy to do lasagne  -  anyway it was delicious. I can't say the same for my friend's meal, who ordered the penne ala norma. It tasted fishy, literally. The waitress asked if he wanted something else, he said no, but they comped it anyway. Now that's a classy place.  For dessert, I wanted the chocolate souffle, but was too full so I went with the tiramisu. It was great, as was the cappuccino.   Overall a very good experience. Nice ambiance, attentive service, great food, and I can't wait to try the chocolate souffle next time. I also saw a couple eating the pizza margherita and it looks great also (and only $10).

There was a young server and a lady and they never once came to take our order.  Will never go back.  We walked out and went down the street for lunch.  What was strange is that both servers were just wandering around the restaurant.  Almost like they didn't want to serve us.  There were no other tables ordering and I find this just odd.

While seeming a high end restaurant, the price and the flavor did not match. I expected it to be much more expensive. I would have paid more.

I would give this 5 stars but most of the time it seems like the staff is slow and doesn't care a whole about giving good service. Maybe it's that we normally come in as a group of 6 or 8 people but that's still not an excuse to leave drinks sitting empty when we're the only ones in there.   My favorite is getting the lunch special pizza and having prosciutto added to it. Very filling and only $6.50. That's pretty hard to beat. Especially in downtown Chandler.",

Though a bit pricey for the average person, the food definitely made up and was delicious!  I ordered the lasagna.  it came out piping hot in a dish and was incredible. Probably the best Ive had outside of home made.  A buddy of mine ordered the pizza and it too was great.    i wasn't a fan of their bread so much that they give out before hand.  But it's always nice to have something before the main course.  I will definitely go here again!",

    "text": "I really cannot express how I feel about this place with a simple 5 stars. This place was absolutely AMAZING! My boyfriend took us here as a surprise for our first valentine's day together. I was a bit skeptical at first since this is downtown chandler (which I HATE) and I had never heard of it before. Especially because it's the only one around. So we get in and it was very intimate and relaxing. Our server was on top of everything and kept our drinks filled and made sure we were doing okay regularly. We ordered the mozzarella wrapped in prosciutto with mushrooms and bread crumbs appetizer. AMAZING! I got the manicotti for my meal. ANOTHER AMAZING dish. My boyfriend ordered their smoke salmon. I do not like fish so I did not care for it but my boyfriend said it was fantastic. Got to take the word of a fish eater. We then went there recently for a date. We got the same appetizer again and it was still great! We also shared a pizza. Their pizza was cooked in a brick oven and came out tasting better than most places we usually go to ie: native new yorker, venezia's, nypd. Prices are amazing and I would really like to try the desserts next time but I am always so full when I am finished eating!  Lets just say I would give this place a million stars and we will be back many times!",

Very friendly hostess, waiter Ricardo was the bomb!  We had the calamari, little too rubbery mushy for me.  Also had the bruschetta yummy, fresh flavors.  Husband had the lasagna, loved it...sopped up the sauce with the bread, yum.  I had the alla Toscana OMG!  Hearty meat sauce, complex flavors, nice pasta, I will be back for this dish! Finished up with the chocolate souffle....wish I could have licked the dish.    Highly recommend the genuine flavors of southern Italy....  It gets noisy in there, the patio is great but small.  Reservations could not be made until 8:30 pm on Saturday night.  Otherwise, great experience, will be back!",

    "text": "This was a tough review for me. I broke the ratings down into individual components to explain. There was one thing that really hurt this review. Here we go:  - Service: 4 out of 5. Friendly and attentive. Relatively prompt. Knowledgeable. She definitely cared about our experience. She was a one-woman show for the whole dining room, and it really is and feels like \"one big room\".  - Food: 4 out of 5. The food was very good. Clearly made to order. Quality ingredients. Rich flavor. We split a Caesar Salad to start. They split the plates which was super nice. Had nice wide slices of cheese, excellent home made croutons, rich dressing, fresh lettuce. We each had a glass of decent Cabernet. They were out of the one we wanted which they recommended. It was mid-week and there were only 3-4 other tables in the place, so not sure why they were out. Chicken marsala over linguini had excellent flavor, thinly pounded chicken, tasty mushrooms, very good. Penne with vodka sauce plus chicken was also very good (mostly). The sauce was rich and tasty and delicious. Portion size was very good across the board. One problem with both dishes was that the chicken was not very tender. The chicken in the penne literally had to be replaced because it was rubbery and dry and tough. They took care of it with no hassle by bringing out a new grilled piece of chicken which I mixed in after picking out the other chicken. I almost never send things back, but this had to be done. The other issue with the pasta was, for an $85 meal, at a restaurant that specializes in Italian food, I would definitely prefer, maybe expect, that the pasta is homemade. This was definitely not. Not bad, but not homemade.  -Atmosphere: 2 out of 5. This is normally not a kicker for me, but this time was impactful. The atmosphere is very strange. If you weren't eating Italian food, from the look of it you might swear you were sitting in a Mexican restaurant. It is not \"comfortable\" inside. Different brightness of lights, some harsh and bright and some softer. One big room with 3 high chandeliers with little bulbs that don't give off enough light. Dark spots. Overly bright spots. They badly need a lighting designer and help with layout. The dining area is one big room with tables placed geometrically in the center. No flow. The table set up is like eating at a social hall, school or church. There are random pieces of large furniture pushed to the walls around the outside of the main dining room. Each one with random things on it, some bowls, some farming equipment or horse tack, strange. The tables and chairs are \"well used\" and could use updating, they just felt old. Maybe throw some nice tablecloths on top?Bathrooms were rough. They weren't disgustingly dirty, they were just old and in disrepair and in desperate need of updating. Men's room urinal was out of order with a big plastic bag around it, the sink faucet was loose and was the wrong size, two or three broken locks painted over in the bathroom stall, The soft door closer leaking oil down the back of the door and extremely bad paint job to try and cover up the old turquoise paint. Paint drips everywhere, missed spots and overspray. I can only explain as an old Burger King bathroom in need of a full remodel. It wasn't dirty, just old and cobbled together. So why was the atmosphere even more important tonight? This is why.....  -VALUE: 3 out of 5. If this was a $30- $50 Italian meal for two, the \"less than comfortable\" atmosphere wouldn't be a huge deal. In my opinion, if you are going out for a nice, date night Italian meal for $85-$100, the atmosphere should feel comfortable, the amenities should be decent and the food should be great. This place had one out of three. Does it need to be total luxury? No. But it should be well above average.  -Conclusion: I live in the area and love supporting local businesses, really wanted to give this place at least four stars. While the food was good and the service was good, those combined with the \"feel\" of the restaurant didn't live up to what I had hoped. Fortunately for the owners, if they wanted to, atmosphere and updates/remodel is the easiest thing to fix and would make a huge difference. They don't have a problem with recipes or service, just the feel. I would like to try it again if there were some updates.",

    "text": "La Stalla review but first why and how I found it. Back in NYC, we dined at Il Vagabondo  for almost 30 years. It was sold,  reopened under the same name but was not as good, then it closed. Since 2005 I have been seeking a great Veal  Parmigiana in Arizona.  Just a few months ago, I finally found it nearby in Awahtukee.  La Stalla is located in a small strip mall on Warner road, close to the I-10.  The Chef is also from Italy just like the one in NYC. The menu was updated to include Veal Parmigiana.  My first experience I thought ok, I try it just as I've done before so many times during my search. BUT this time it was great and reminded me of my favorite NYC  Italian Restaurant. On Thursday 6/27/2019, We started off with the Caprese Salad. The tomatoes were thinly sliced covered with homemade mozzarella. A great start to our meal! The veal was thinly cut, breaded then fried. The marina sauce and mozzarella cheese tasted great. The veal was so tender---how tender was it? My fork could cut it! My meal had a side of pasta also. This meal arrived HOT as it was just like being back in NYC. My wife ordered their special of the evening: Lobster Stuffed Ravioli in a light sauce with little shrimp. It was hot and pleased my wife. Cami is the bartender. She is a  wonderful and friendly person! Closed on Mondays and usually open for lunch.-call first to confirm lunch availability 480-855-9190",

The waiter was almost rude when my husband asked what medium rare is like here,  basic question asked when ordering filet mignon. His response was \"140 degrees\". What? We've been to the finest restaurants from NY to Rome and never heard such a response.  We almost left but decided to try it. I had the cavatelli with sausage and broccoli which tasted pretty good at first and then realized it was swimming in oil. The salad my husband had was pretty good, as was the bread. The filet, awful. We don't think it was filet as it was very thin and had an odd flavor. Needles to say when we got home my husband got sick; we assume from the bad meat  I don't like writing review like this one but felt compelled to share our experience. Maybe we got the wrong waiter and it was an off night for the chef, but we won't be going back.",

We hung out at the bar to take advantage of their happy hour menu. We both ordered a beverage and and also ordered a caprese salad, fried calamari and a small pepperoni pizza. The caprese salad and fried calamari came first. The mozzarella was nasty. There was absolutely no flavor and extremely watery. Looks like it went from the freezer to the plate. The fried calamari was horrible. It was the color of McDonald's french fries and tasted like rubber.  After 2 bites she sent it back and instead asked for a calzone. It took quite a while for it to arrive. It should have stayed in the kitchen. When she cut into it a white milky substance oozed out of it. It was disgusting looking. She tried eating some of it but quickly gave up. The pizza finally came is was greasy and tasteless. Everything about the dinner was a huge disappointment. There was also a couple sitting next to us complaining how badly their red wine tasted.  The bartender could only apologize and blamed it on a new vendor.  How the quality of food could go from so good to so bad blows me away. Shame on them. We won't be back",

    "text": "My mom.and her friends are here last week and loved it. So, we decided to have a family dinner last night. We were early and the place wasnt full but our server seemed super annoyed the minute he came to our table. We ordered the anti pasta to share and it was weird. Romaine lettuce, red peppers, ham, some cheese and pickled green beans and carrots. No dressing. Calamari was strips and was tough and flavorless.  So heres what our server kept doing....someone would ask for bread and he'd abruptly walk away instead of asking for anything else. So when he got back, mom requested butter and he did it again and my sister wanted sugar for her coffee, so he had to run and get it. Never gave us a minute to ask for other things.  He was running himself around by not saying \"anything else \"? My sister had lemon chicken with linguine in olive oil and garlic and the pasta was SWIMMING in oil. Niece ordered the ravioli,  again, swimming in oil. Fettuccine alfredo was bland and the lasagne wasnt like the stacked, cut thru layers kind. It came out thick in sauce and cheese and again just swimming in all of that but had good flavor. We had tiramisu for dessert and the tartufo. Both very good. It's kind of pricey as well. 180 for 5 of us. 2 apps and 5 meals, no drinks.  Overall, I wouldn't put this at the top of my list but wouldn't be opposed to coming back.",

You know, where they are kind of embarrassed for the slowness when the restaurant is half-empty.  The complimentary bread basket was good - crispy exterior, soft interior.  Unfortunately, our entrees, which were the specials, were not.  Husband's osso buco was a little tough, and the sauce was definitely lacking something and was on the salty side.  As for my dish, it was plain awful.  I had the penne with salmon and asparagus.  I had exactly one asparagus tip.  If you put together all the slices, it may have equaled one stalk.  I have no proof, but I believe the salmon was from a can.  It was mixed into the cream sauce, had that strange canned texture, was extremely salty, and no piece was bigger than a pea.  The cream sauce was bland without any herb or seasoning, and was extremely salty.  In addition, some of the penne had that hard, rubbery texture like it had been sitting and dried out.",

    "text": "I really wanted to love this restaurant.  It's local and has a nice atmosphere (except for the paper on top of the table cloth....my 8 year old even said, \"this paper is unpleasant.\")    It was my 72 year old mother-in-law's birthday.  I stopped in on my way to pick my son up from school to check out the restaurant and menu.  When I went in I wondered if they were open as nobody was around.  Finally I got the attention of the bar tender who gave me a paper menu to take along and talked up the owners and food as truly authentic Italian.  I arrived before my husband, who was bringing our son, mother-in-law and father-in-law (who is in a wheelchair).  The hostess was very nice and set up a table that was easy to access/room for the wheelchair.  The restaurant was busy which included at least two large parties of 8 plus in the dinning room.  We sat down and waited ....waters....waited...oh you need menus.....waited and waited....drink order...waited and waited...drinks came out hand carried one or two at a time...ugh.  The waitress was pleasant but seemed to be taking care of most of the tables even though there seemed to be plenty of other staff around.  Anyway, the special dinner item was kangaroo.  None of us felt like going there....is kangaroo an \"authentic Italian\" dish?    We ordered the Anitpaso Italiano to start which was very good, but a really tiny plate for the price.  The bread basket was a complimentary thin, short little bread for our table of 5.  My husband also ordered a bowl of minestrone.  The soup was bland and overpowered by the taste of the overcooked broccoli in the soup.  Never had Minestrone with broccoli (and peas).  My father-in-law had the Costolette D'Agnello alla Griglia (lamb chops) accompanied by the \"fresh\" vegetable of the day.  He ate the lamb chops not the veggies.  The veggies were awful and strange.  It's like they were boiled and overcooked (cabbage, potato, zucchini & carrot) except the carrot was undercooked and hard.  My mother-in-law had the Spaghetti alla Carbonara.  She ate it.   Didn't complain about it, but it looked heavy (too thick) and beige.  I had the Pappardelle Marie Monti (spinach pasta, Scallops & porcini mushrooms in an \"imported\" light cherry tomato sauce).  Bland, oily and the scallops would have been nice with a sear on each side.  My husband and son split the Pollo al Marsala...which the menu says is pan seared.  The chicken was almost certainly boiled with like a mushroom, butter gravy added afterward.  No marsala flavor.  This also came with the awful and strange \"fresh\" vegetable of the day.  The service was painfully slow for everything even after the bigger parties had cleared out.  No offer for a second glass of wine, and refills on soft drinks was next to impossible as the waitress had no support (buss staff, etc.).   We had dirty dinner plates even while we ate our little cupcake I brought to put a candle in for grandma's birthday.  Good thing too, because we were not offered dessert.  I did manage to get a coffee, which was brought out black (no spoon or cream).  There was sugar on the table from earlier and when I asked for cream...\"oh, you need cream\"....stirred the cream in with one of the forks I didn't use from dinner.    As an afterthought the waitress brought a couple of fresh plates and forks for our cupcakes, but it was too little too late.  The check was brought over and we never saw the waitress again.  Guess it was a good thing we paid cash and didn't need change.  We got up to leave (not a fast moving group) and there was not any staff waitress, hostess, bartender who said goodbye, thank you, have a good night.  In fact I thought this was so strange, I yelled back into the restaurant goodbye, your welcome....still not one staff member turned their head to acknowledge  me.  Not going back...what a shame...I REALLY wanted to like this place.",

Despite our server's arrival with great enthusiasm, it went down hill from there.He even wanted to let us know that was not your usual pasta place with regular spaghetti etc... How's that for an insult to your customers?  I like basic pasta places and I am capable of discerning between types of food. Our food arrived cold and we had to send all entrees back to the kitchen. Our server was nowhere to be found and we had to request another server to come to our table and take the food back. It appears there is no bus staff or management as well! Our server seemed overwhelmed! Our salad plates were not cleared before entrees came out and he had to set down our entrees on a table next to us to clear the dirty plates. Speaking of dirty plates my sisters appetizer plate was dirty when it arrived as was her fork with residual food.  I requested another glass of wine and he took my empty glass and went to attend to another table and set my dirty glass on their table while he took an order from them! My sister asked for decaf coffee and a dessert menu and she was told there was no decaf!  He said I can try and make you some if you want!!! Are you kidding me??? In a restaurant of this caliber no coffee made?? We asked to share two desserts for four people. Perhaps they were low on forks and spoons because we got two spoons for all of us to share. We are a close family but I want my own cutlery when dining out. At one point we thought we might have been a reality TV show because it was so ridiculous. We love fine dining and were so looking forward to going here!   We came in from California for this!  My son and daughter have both been servers and we are great supporters of the service industry so I would encourage La Stalla to hire some bus boys so your servers can do the job they need to do.",

The bruschetta was bland- anemic tomatoes, not enough basil or garlic. We tried two different veal dishes. The saltimbocca was tough and boring. The  involutini was really tasty. Unlike other yelpers, we liked the authentic feel of the paper on the tables. The place was busy for a Wednesday night and they had live music. We will try happy hour or lunch specials next time. We don't like to spend that kind of money for food that is just \"good\".",

    "text": "Hands down my new favorite restaurant. Have only been twice so far, but have tried many items on the menu and everything has been delicious. Both times I went with a friend of the owner and he ordered a variety of items so we could sample a lot of things.   The hi-lites include: the margherita pizza - I am probably forever ruined for any other pizza. The calamari - tender and tasty. The chicken marsala - would prefer it with pasta (came with veggies & potatoes) but absolutely delicious. The orechiette with eggplant, huge portion and so good. I don't eat proscuitto but my husband does and he absolutely loved it with the soft cheese appetizer (don't remember the name) - I did try the soft cheese and it was incredible.  First time we went the server gave us our bill without asking if we wanted dessert or coffee (which I was there with old world Italians so espresso at the end of the meal is a must) so that was a bit of a turnoff, but otherwise the service is good, ambience is great (live music on Friday night was lovely but a little loud).  They serve Illy coffee which is one of my favorites and always brings me back to my trip to Italy, and an Illy cappuccino is the perfect way to end the night IMO. Haven't tried the desserts yet but heard the tiramisu is amazing and will have that next time. Can't wait to go back again, and again.",

Seasoned well, cooked to perfection and it was a big portion for the right price. I had the Pollo al Marsala topped with a excellent mushroom marsala wine sauce. Hmmmmm.....delicious!!!!!   Although I didn't eat there my experience was great and very clean place. I highly recommend eating here. I'm glad I did. I went to a place right next to the hotel I'm staying in but chose to leave after the service was disappointing from the moment I walked in. Totally different experience at La Stalla.

They have a great wine selection, and delicious coffee and espresso. Regardless of what I end up ordering, I always have to finish my meal with Creme brulee. Absolutely phenomenal. My sister claims the tiramisu is the best she's ever had, but I'm so hung up on my Creme brulee I might never find out!  Some Sunday nights they have a guy named Matt playing guitar in there, we enjoy going in to see him. We usually go later in the night, around 7 or 8 and there is usually never a wait to get in.   This place is an upgrade from your standard chain Italian restaurants, I highly recommend it!",

    "text": "We dropped in last night for happy hour after checking out the farmer's market in Downtown Chandler. Happy hour goes until 6pm (half priced apps and pizzas!!), and since it was pretty close to that time, we were given menus and waited on right away. We decided on the margherita pizza and bocconcini al prosciutto (read mozzarella sticks wrapped in proscuitto topped with mushrooms and breadcrumbs, not fried).   Soon after ordering, we were brought fresh slices of bread and some balsamic vinegar. After mixing the balsamic with the olive oil that was already at the table, we quickly devoured most of the bread.  It didn't take too long for the food to come. The \"cheese sticks\" came out first. Different from anything I've had before, but they were quite tasty...we fought over the mushrooms that topped the 3 cheese sticks. The pizza shortly followed, and it was big enough for 3 people to share (not bad for $5)! We agreed that the pizza was good, but nothing too special. It had a crushed tomato sauce with scattered fresh basil, smothered in mozzarella cheese on a thin crust and cooked in a brick oven. It was a great pizza for the price; if I go back, I'd like to try one of their other pizzas.  The bill was less than $20 for the pizza, appetizer, a glass of wine and a glass of beer. Not to mention we were pretty full. The atmosphere is cozy and romantic, with low lighting. The service was pretty good, although it took forever to get our check- I was quickly becoming inpatient. I'm not sure if I'd rush back there, but if you're in the area around happy hour time I'd suggest giving it a shot!",

DO NOT GO FOR HAPPY HOUR!! Totally not worth it. Calamari is chewy texture, barely fried, and way over salted. Drinks were sub par. We were never offered the specials. No one cleaned our dirty plates off of the table. Portions were small. Horrible experience overall. The bill was astronomical for the lousy food, terrible atmosphere and awful service.

We were greeted with a smile and seated promptly.  The high back wooden chairs seemed appropriate for the decor, but the legs of my chair were uneven by at least 1/2\".  Once I found a spot for the legs on the floor that minimized the rocking back and forth, I forgot about the initial annoyance.  I found our server pretentious and lacking (Chris?).   I ordered the sweet potato ravioli with gorgonzola sauce and our server's response is, \"Do you like bleu cheese?\"  I answered I did as long as it wasn't too strong and then he responds with, \"Well, the gorgonzola is like bleu cheese so you won't like this dish.\"  Why assume I don't know what gorgonzola is?    I ordered something else.  He knows the menu better than I.  We also ordered bruschetta that had eggplant.   To this food request, he states, \"Now this has eggplant on it, you know what eggplant is, right?\"   I was irritated.   Why assume your tables have minimal idea of some basic foods?  The beef dish I ordered had a sauce that seemed to come straight from a stew can.  It was gelatinous and the meat was pale and fatty.   My dining partner liked her dish of the gnocchi but I'm puzzled why she wasn't queried on whether or not she knew what it was.  We were out of water several times and, thankfully, other servers remedied that.  Our server lacked basic serving skills by not filling drinks, bringing dishes out without first making sure the table has space enough for the plates.  Two times we were scrambling to move things out of the way of the incoming food.  He put dirty glasses from one table on the same tray as fresh drinks on their way to be delivered to another table.   Yeah, it's pretty clear I just didn't like him.  The best food item on the table was bread.  Great crust and soft on the inside.  I *might* be willing to try this place again. The restaurant wasn't overly crowded with people pounding their way in the door, but there were enough people there to make me think they were having a good experience and mine might have been an exception.  However, first impressions speak volumes and as long as I don't get the same server, I'd be willing to give it one more try.",

Most recently I came here with my sisters and friends after my baby shower on a Saturday night. We were seated immediately and service was great. The food was amazing as always. I love the salad with the pear and walnuts! I remembered how amazing it was years ago and I was so happy it is still on the menu. All 5 of us were very impressed with the food and service that night! I wish I could afford to eat here every night.",

    "text": "Not too bad!! Would go back!!   First off this place is located in downtown Chandler, which I love the area and it fits right in. It's located on buffalo street right across from San Marcos hotel. It's a small little restaurant with a warm feel.  Right off the bat I was very surprised by the ambience. Staff was extremely friendly so no issues there.    On to the food.  I ordered the Cavatelli Pasta with Sausage, broccoli, in a garlic sauce.  While the dish was decent it didn't blow me away.  It didn't meet the standards not the wow factor that the decor gave me.  It left me wanting for more.  Not more food as the serving was sufficient just  more flavor.  Prices wasn't bad as my meal was 10.00. But it was more on the bland side and the pasta itself was a little tough.  I left full but not entirely satisfied.    Overall I would visit again and perhaps just order a different dish as my friend had the salmon and mentioned it was delicious.",

Also I was craving chicken fettuccine alfredo. It was not on the menu but I did ask the server and he said he would ask the cooks in the back if they could whip some up. Sure enough, they were pleased to do that for me! It was beyond amazing! The alfredo sauce was made to order and the chicken was very tender, fettuccine was al dente, just how I like it! I will be coming here for my Italian cravings. Overall great experience with the service and everything!",

When we told them we had a reservation (10 people) they were like well it won't be until that time (we were 30 minutes early...) then ever sat us and when we asked about our table they were like ummm well the other reservation (that was 30 minutes late) is here so we are going to sit them instead. And including that they had multiple tables open the whole time.... ever said I'm sorry.... let's say they lost hundreds of dollars tonight.",

I took the recommendation and ordered the special of the day, couldn't be more pleased. Swordfish was very flavorful and cooked perfectly. Not sure if it's on the menu, but it should be. Definitely worth  drive. Can't wait to come back and see what else is on the menu.",

Our server was fantastic which can make or break the whole experience for our family. My hubby went for a healthy lunch, soup and salad. I  had Salmon with veggies... so delicious! My son loved every bite of his chicken parmesan sandwich with fries and our daughter enjoyed manicotti and house salad. Dessert after Sunday lunch??? Yes please! They make a really good tiramisu in a glass... make sure to order the espresso too!",

Cute little place with an overall good food selection. They have an extensive wine list as well.  only thing that bugged the shit out of me was they had that white construction paper covering the cloth table cover and it was just annoying. i mean really? you really cant afford to change the table cloths and wash them so you don't have to use that annoying tacky paper???yucky!  okay I'm done bitchin'  overall nice spot glad i finally checked it out.",

The food is absolutely delicious and the ambiance is perfect.  Have gone with a group of people multiple times and it was a mixed order of veg and non veg dishes.  Everyone raved about their dish... so it seems like you can't go wrong with your pick.  Downside is that the wait time is long but the food is delicious, which is why I'll be going back.  We usually grab some vino and wait by the bar for our table.",

She dropped the menu on the table and walked away after I asked for the lunch specials.  She served bread to the new table and didn't come to our table at all for about 15 mins.  The pizza with artichokes, sausage and prosciutto was so-so. Not impressed. Will not go back again.",

    "text": "Ok so to be fair, I'm giving 4 stars here based on how I'm averaging everything. First of all, the food here is AMAZING. Be prepared to wait if you order a baked dish because it is all made the moment you order. It's worth it though. Personally, my favorite is the Orechiette Alla Norma - Fresh Orechiette pasta, sauteed eggplant, garlic, fresh mozzarella and salted ricotta cheese in a hearty tomato sauce. VERY fresh ingredients. I believe they use ricotta salata which they freshly grate on top. OMG SO GOOD. I've also tried the manicotti and ceasar salad, etc. ALL the food is great. SO..what to improve. Each time Ive been there, there has always been the same waitress working the whole place herself. Most times this is no biggie but there are times where she is clearly overworked and stretched too thin. I don't mind waiting for the food but I want it right when it comes out, as this place does it all right-made to order, fresh, piping hot deliciousness. They could use a busboy or some help at times. Just a suggestion :) If you love Italian, you HAVE to try La Stalla!",
