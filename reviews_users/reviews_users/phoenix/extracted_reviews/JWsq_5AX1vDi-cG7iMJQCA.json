I highly suggest you follow one of the recipes posted above the stir fry area if you're unsure of which seasonings and sauces you should use.  I used quite a bit of several sauces (well, I thought it was quite a bit) and the flavor wasn't terribly strong.  But it was still very tasty.  The only draw backs for me is there is little ambiance (it feels somewhat like a cafeteria) and you will be charged a dollar for a to-go box.  I'd rather be charged an extra dime for my meal than having folks being nickle and dimed for a to-go box.  It just doesn't leave me with a good feeling to discover, after a nice meal, that I have to pay to take my leftovers home.  I believe they have no problem with folks bringing in a plastic container, though.",

My wife wanted to really try it...so we decided to visit this locale before going to the movies. I have to say for the 21.00 bucks I spent for the 2 of us I was not disappointed at all. The food was very good....the service was first class....and the meal comes with a drink and dessert as well. However do keep in mind if you decide to do the \"One bowl, One trip\" deal you can take your food with you....but if you do the buffet....and eat in then you cannot take anything with you. This establishment is within walking distance of the Ultrastar Cinema and a great place to get a great meal before you see your show. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!",

At the end of the line a chef makes it on the grill in front of you. The noodle selection is great, ramen to rice noodles if you want them. You also get soup, rice and crispy noodles as sides. My hubby and I split the large bowl - which is 10.95 (this includes the drink too.) There is always enough for both. I think for kids, there is a yogurt machine too, never tried it. The restaurant is clean, the staff is friendly and the food is great - best of all, it's your creation and it's healthy. You can eat inside or out - nice place to eat before or after a movie - which is a few stores down.",

BUT the sweet young lady was more than happy to have us come in! I had never been there so I wasn't really sure what to do except shove all the stuff I liked into a bowl as high as I could make it! Then when I hit the sauce bar I got a glazed look over my eyes and some nice fella just popped up asking if he could be of service. He explained that he was a sauce specialist...we talked about every sauce and he made some recommendations off of the feedback I gave and started spooning stuff into a bowl. We took it to the cook guy and he stirred and sauted my goodies until they were properly cooked and put it back in a bowl. It was really yummy! And I can't wait to go back!!! Get a doggie dish because you will need it!!",

    "text": "I love this place!  I have been going here for years.  There is a reason why this is the only restaurant that survived in the Pavilions after all of the other restaurants, movie theater, and Best Buy were closed.    You make your own mix of meat, noodles, rice, veggies, sauce, etc. and they cook it on the wok for you.  Prices have gone up since I first started going here.  I believe dinner used to be $7.50 and now it is around $10.25 (for dinner, lunch is cheaper), but it is a lot of food.  Get a to go box for $.75, which comes out to $11.  Keep in mind this includes a drink and a huge amount of food, if you get a to go box it is enough for another meal.",

    "text": "I gave this place a second chance. My first visit was a few weeks back (right before closing time, but was served very nicely by the hostess and a friendly cook).  Today, I was greated by a hostess. She asked what size of bowl I would like and if it was my first time. I chose the \"medium\" bowl (huge mistake... IT'S A LOT OF FOOD) and replied with a \"yes\". She walked with me and gave me tips on how to make a delicious combination.   I am a believer! I enjoyed my meal and I loved the personal touch the hostess gave to my experience.  The concept is similar to Genghis Grill (mongolian grill) with a simpler selection of proteins and vegetables, and sauces instead of condiments. They have a visible board with a list of combinations for the customers to try.   They do not serve alcohol (only reason why I would prefer Genghis Grill) over YC now, and it is fast casual (unlike Genghis where the friendly servers are always helping out customers).  Different colors and flavors for different tastes. I am glad I tried this place out.... Hope they keep up with the awesome experience I enjoyed today.",

    "text": "I've been coming here for a few years, and have always left satisfied (and full).  Starting off with meat, there's chicken, turkey, beef, or pork (and I think there's fish at night). All four of the meats are pretty good - they're all pretty much equally good, so no real favorite.  Next comes the veggies - my plate usually consists of carrots, onions, green onions, bell peppers, and tomatoes. There are plenty of other choices that I'm not too fond of, like broccoli, tofu, bean sprouts, and several more that I can't think of.  I always go with the standard noodles, but they've also got rice noodles that look like they might be pretty good.  The sauces are pretty awesome. My usual consists of some YC's own, orange, garlic, ginger, and spicy hunan. Or if I'm in the mood, I'll go with just a straight up sweet and sour. But it's an art to make the right combination and also the right amount, so you may be safer just following the recommendations on the board.  As they prepare the dish, there's a few minutes to put together a bowl of rice, a bowl of pretty decent hot beef soup, and some chips and sweet and sour sauce, along with my drink (all of this is included in the price). By this time, your meal is probably close to ready - top the bowl off with some cilantro, and there's your meal.  I haven't tried the frozen yogurt, but I think it was pretty cheap, like a buck, so if you're in the mood for dessert, it's definitely worth it.  Overall, this place is great - you get plenty of food for your money, and it's fresh and pretty healthy.",

Okay, I know know that this is \"Asian fusion\" but that's all I am coming across in the valley. A whole bunch of \"fusion\" food. Give me authentic. Give me something that doesn't taste like all the chain restaurants around the area. I would have liked to have seen some baby corn, bamboo shoots and water chestnuts available as veggies to add to your dish here. In the meantime I will continue my search for good Asian cuisine around the area that doesn't taste like a microwaveable meal from the grocery store.",

That said, I've been to other Mongolian BBQ's and have come to realize that the restaurant's part of the responsibility is a key factor!!!  I've given this YC's many chances:  followed more than one displayed recipe, experimented with my own concoctions.  Regardless, the result of every visit is mediocre at best.  My guess is perhaps the quality of veggies (even though they look fresh, doesn't mean they taste good) the ingredients of the sauces, or the cooking method, not to mention the noodles/rice, and ambiance, is the cause for my disappointment.  I recommend Genghis Grill @ the Tempe Marketplace for a much better experience! :D",

I've had it before at the food court in the mall and I usually love it because the flavors were always right. They have a good variety of meat, I wish they had more options for fish though! The veggies were also good, great variety. I'm a light eater so I had more veggies than meat and more fish. What got me was selecting my sauces! Too many to choose from and I had no clue what to add haha. Service was good, we had a young gentlemen check up on us which was nice because not every restaurant has a manager do that. (FYI that is a huge factor in the restaurant industry, a manager should always check on every table at least once!) But overall I had a pleasant experience here and I would definitely be back because the food was absolutely delicious, the portions, well that's really up to you on how much you shove in your bowl haha and it wasn't expensive at all! 25 dollars for two of us! You Can't beat that!",

It used to be tradition for my dad and I to come after swim meets because i'd LOAD up on food after swimming my little booty off!   The prices have changed throughout the years but I believe now you can get a small bowl for around $12. This sounds high but my goodness, you can pack that bowl SKY HIGH so it actually ends up being enough food to fill a large bowl. You go through the line starting with meats (I'm a chicken and beef gal + don't forget to press the meat down with a piece of their thin paper so that it doesn't take up your whole bowl!), and then load up on tons of veggies, noodles, and ALL THE SAUCES. My favorite sauces are their YC's own, garlic, a little bit of peanut oil, chili oil, cooking wine, and whatever else sounds good to me that day. They have tiny bowls that you can put your sauce mixture in so that it doesn't make a mess. Because trust me, your bowl will be packed to the max and if you put the sauces over the pile, they'll run right off. Then, head over to the Mongolian grill masters where they'll grill up your bowl of goodness right in front of you!   Next, you can grab their wontons (I love dipping them in sweet and sour sauce), top your bowl with peanuts, fresh cilantro, and pineapple if you like it, and grab a bowl of rice and soup. Can you say LOADS of food?! They do charge a little extra for to-go bags but I will tell you that from my experience, it just isn't as good the next day. Some people even get it to-go from the start and just eat half there and take the rest home. Everyone has their own method to their madness. I'll be back soon, YC's!",

They have plenty of sauces and other add-ons to get just the flavor you want.  Personally I'm all about the spices so I pile on the jalapenos, red peppers, and chile sauce.  The cooks are efficient and fast.  The pricing is a simple flat rate; choose your bowl size between small, large, and unlimited.  The drinks, rice, soups, and things like that are part of the deal.  The part that's not so great is that they are insanely packed during lunch and dinner rush, or times when there's a lot going on in the area.  It can take forever to get through the line, and then you can't reach some of the add-ons by the grills because there are so many people.  Such as my beloved jalapenos, unfortunately.",

The staff at this restaurant is beyond accommodating from the food selection to the dinning experience Kelly from your staff made it the most memorable dinning experience ever We would definitely come again !",

    "text": "Take tips from a former employee, from when dinner was $9 and the bowls were ceramic.  SPRING for the large bowl, when you pick up your bowl conveniently take two, it is for sauce later, you will need it. Depending on the time of day employees might enforce their one bowl rule even after you inform them it is for sauce because they have small bowls above the sauce later down the line. Those bowls are small, they are for rookies, you want a large bowl for sauce.  TO GO. Tell them your order is to go, there is no reason to pay $0.50 per box to eat there, the ambience at home with your dog is better. When they asked \"do you want a soup cup?\", you bet your sweet buns you want a soup cup. Even if you hate soup you want a soup cup. You have taken naps all week for dinner to be able to afford this $14 treat.  PROFILE both lanes before committing. The elderly and the young will slow you down, avoid lanes with these people. If only one lane is open ask an employee to open the other lane, it is probably closed for restocking but they can restock around you, but be empathetic and keep your trip clean because they have probably just cleaned it.  MEAT is at the beginning and you will need to grab tissue to smash it down. Meat is the enemy!! Or at least it can be. The meat is curled on purpose. It is at the beginning so that it takes up more space in your bowl - that is why it is curved. Be smarter than the dead meat. Find lots of small pieces that are flat or find curled pieces that look less frozen than others so they are easier to smash.  FLAT veggies go on first. They go around the edges, flush with the sides of your bowl leaving the middle for baby corn or potatoes and the like i.e. non-flat stuff.  BROCCOLI was public enemy number two in this race to stuff your face, but now it's your bff. Pick pieces of broccoli with long stems and put them on your tray until you have put ALL other veggies in your bowl. Only then will you place each individual piece of broccoli around the edge of your bowl like a tasty Christmas wreath. Push the stem down into the other veggies and use the head of each broccoli piece to increase the size of your bowl!! Holy Batman, Batman, that's friggin genius!  NOODLES now that your broccoli wreath has stabilized the mass of veggies in your bowl and increased stackable surface area, you are ready for noodles. TWIRL those noodles like it's mom's spaghetti and your palms aren't sweaty. The more your noodles look like a suburban bird's nest, the better. STACK EM HIGH, if you do it right you can balance three or more bird's nests in top of your bowl and by this time your mass should be touching the sneeze guard!  TRIPLE SAUCE. You are a pro, you have trained for this, you spent all that time looking at the YC's menu of sauce combinations online and you have memorized what you want, now triple it. Break out that hidden second large bowl and scoop yo sauce. If you got bowl blocked in the beginning you will need two small bowls and to develop a better slide of hand for next time. Don't bother trying to put sauce in your skyscraper bowl, you will spill, employees will glare at you, just use the extra bowl (s).  RESTACK. If there is a line at the grill, transfer your tray over to the waiting area and attempt to stack any stragglers back on top of your bowl but, just like two a.m. at the club, DO NOT SMASH it!  ASK if the grill person can scrape the grill (it helps to flash some cash at this point to let the grill person know you mean business, tip em if you got em) you spent a lot of time curating your flavor, don't let your predecessors' bowls muck it up!  REMEMBER to mention that it is to go. They will hand you: a small box, a cup, a utensil, a bag. Get them all. Don't get shorted.  SIDES. While you are waiting, fill your box with rice half way and crispy wontons totally smashed half way (still crunchy and delicious, just more food per inch cubed if they are smashed a little, or a lot, w/e). If your gigantic spaceship of food is still being grilled, grab some soup. DRAIN the broth. Broth is for the sick and the rich, you came here for value and to live on left overs for a week. AFTER the soup cup if full of chicken and veggies you can add some broth to keep it warm on the drive home.  COLLECT your food from the grill master. If you have not allotted at least two large boxes and a small box you need more practice.  NO ICE. Ice is for penguins and polar bears, you need soda and have no room for space fillers like frozen water.   MOVE out of the way of others trying to get stuff and things from the small area to do so. Close the tops of your boxes and put them in your plastic bag at a table near the back - far away from the line and the rush. Don't be a menace, while standing there drinking your juice.  Good luck to you on your journey to massive gains, may the odds be ever in your favor.",

After his food was prepared we sat outside and started having a conversation. In the middle of it he offered me to try his dish and gave me a fork with a little meat and noodles on it. The same second some employee ran outside and started shouting at us! No, he wasn't quiet and polite, he shouted so people at other tables started looking at us with interest. He said my husband was not allowed to give me to try his food because I didn't pay for it. Huh? ... But the food that was on the table had been paid for?! Doesn't matter. You wanna try it - take it home!  I was speechless. For the first time I felt so insulted by a restaurant employee. We took the rest of the food to go and decided to never come back to this place again.",

    "text": "Since I eat at Mongolian BBQ as often as possible where I live in California, I was excited to find a place in a very new area of Arizona. This area is a place that didn't even exist when I was growing up here.   So I have to say since I have been to so many, this is not a new concept for me, and I can compare what I know to be great Mongolian to this.   To educate those that have never been to one, you usually can get as many bowls as you want to use to create the master dish you want to be cooked together. Here, they yelled at us for using more than one bowl and told us to push it down with a piece of paper .... what?!? And meanwhile, those around me where doing it making a huge mess, how could they not? This rule is absurd. Take two bowls and fill them up as you like, then they are cooked together and the cook turns it back to you in one HUGE bowl that is the size of the two small ones that you filled up with even more room.   I am just used to little authentic Mongolian places where there are no rules as to how you create your master dish. And this thing with either all you can eat or one trip for a dollar less is just ridiculous. Just make it one price, all you can eat period. Allowing customers to choose between two choice that have a dollar difference was creating such a negative atmosphere in there with the server going around and telling everyone what they are doing wrong and that they have to get the all you can eat if they use more than one bowl, and if they do all you can eat, they still can only use one bowl. Its just not a good set up for happy customers.   The fun party about Mongolian is being your own master chief, let your customers do that without ridiculous restrictions on bowl usage and smashing down food to make rood for more to pile it up like a tower that is falling down all over the counter.",

Unfortunately I found a hair in my food but Maria came by and appoligized for the hair and asked me I wanted to start over.  End of story, right. Wrong, Maria brought me a card for a free meal and when I explained that I didn't need that and wasn't looking for that she told me that was exactly why she gave it to me.

    "text": "I have eaten here for years and years as the movie theatres and surrounding restaurants (and even an entire row of buildings!) has come and gone. YC's has remained and it's still as tasty as ever. Grab a bowl (don't bother getting the big one if you can save a buck, there's no way you'll be able to eat the full portion of even the smaller bowl, lol), grab a wax paper to smush all the good ingredients down into the bowl, and go to town. I like that they added extra bowls up by the sauces a while ago, since previously you were guaranteed to slosh sauce all over your tray :P  The ingredients are always fresh and tasty, they have a nice selection of options, and the sides at the end are nice (I like the tasty, if not a bit salty beef soup - add a glob of brown rice into it and mm it is delish!). Also, after trying Genghis grill - YC's system of keeping the meet choices cold/semi frozen is the way to go - the meat looked NASTY at Genghis in comparison.   It's not a fancy place, it's not the cheapest place for quick food... but man if you want to eat some dang tasty stir-fry until you need to unbutton your pants and call a flatbed truck to take you home - YC's is the place!",

I could not believe how delicious my meal was. I did finally try a new sauce: Kung Pao, so I don't know if that was it or not but everything was cooked to perfection. It was the busiest I have ever seen the restaurant too.   The staff, which was clearly under a lot of pressure, did not compromise their customer service at all. There was a woman helping out the chefs who was extremely courteous and would help you out with whatever you want. She kept the line moving and was very efficient. The chefs were also really nice! My mom has a food allergy. When you mention you have a food allergy they clean the entire cook top and get new utensils. Most places have an attitude because it's extra work for them. Not this place, they were very nice and were able to accommodate my mom's request. Even when she asked for the food to be cooked well done with not a lot of water, the chef said \"sure\" and made her food to perfection.   Love this place!",

    "text": "YC's is awesome. Plain and simple. Awesome.   When you eat at YC's, you are not simply a patron. You become an architect-chef-artist hybrid; the ingredient bar becomes your palette, your hands become your paintbrush, and your bowl becomes your canvas. After paying your $10.25, you are given permission to create a masterpiece.  Your first stop on this culinary Safari is at the meats. Slightly frozen, these curls of chicken, beef, pork, and cod look kinda freaky to be honest. But give it time. By midnight these freaky little meat swirls will become your Cinderella. You will be longing for more. This is also the beginning of your architect job. You must begin balancing your bowl in such a way as to create a stable mountain of Mongolian delicacies maximizing the $10.25 entrance fee. You do so by utilizing the parchment paper provided and squishing all of your ingredients to their basic form in your bowl. Watch someone else if it's your first time. It's an art.   Next step the vegetables. Still utilizing the parchment paper to hulk smash every ingredient down to its most compact form, continue to pack that baby with everything you can! The veggies are also fresh and delicious.   Finally: stacking noodles. This is the most vital step in your architect role. Pile these babies on!!! The wheat noodles are like strings of happiness. They will make you smile.   The last role that you must play is that of chef. It's more like mad scientist. At this point in front of you there are seemingly hundreds of containers of magic potions (or sauces) and you are given the task of creating the elixir of life. The sauces are delicious no matter what you do. Don't fret too much.   Lastly you hand your heaping mountain of Mongolian BBQ to the gentlemen that will shortly become your best friend. He will then take your masterpiece and turn it into a steaming heap of bliss. At this point, you enjoy.   YCs is delicious. Go there for lunch. Or dinner. Or your birthday. Or your graduation. Or one year anniversary. Or 20 year anniversary. Or wedding. Or anytime.",

Being a family of four (wife, kids and i) we have found that two servings to go is plenty of food to feed us all. My kids are both under 10 and barely eat lol.  During our trip through the buffet line creating our masterpiece bowls, my wife was informed that we had to leave if we were getting our food to go. I simply asked why? She informed me that there's no sharing.  I asked well Is it endless trips to buffet? -She says no. I say so why does it matter, we like to get it to go because we can't eat it all and we will take what's left home. She then told me that by doing that we are RIPPING THE OFF! I Know that this is just an employee speaking there mind without a filter and I assume management wouldn't approve but this definitely upset my wife and made us leary of returning.    Brings back a saying I've heard: \"Don't hate the player, hate the game\"  YCS YOU SHOULD TELL YOUR EMPLOYEES TO ENCOURAGE FAMILY'S TO ENJOY THEMSELVES NOT INSULT THEM OVER A FEW DOLLARS. LOYALTY?",

This restaurant serves up a delightful array of proteins, vegetables, noodles, sauces, dry rubs, rice and fried won ton with sauces. You go down the line and build a bowl--large or small that you are handed at the register where you pay for the bowls. The meal includes a drink. There is huge grill where it's all cooked together. At the end by the grill there is brown and white rice, wontons and sweet and sour sauce for the won tons. Our waitress gave us each a cup to put frozen yogurt in as a treat from her. She was very friendly, welcoming and  nice. (The frozen yogurt is an extra $1.00 if you want to add it on to your meal). Our meal was delicious, hot and fresh. We enjoyed eating here. We will definitely be back.",

Being from out of town the manager answered questions about the area for us.  Definitely would recommend this location.",

The options have grown over the past ten years and I love it! There are so many combinations you can do, from the seasoning and sauce combinations to what you actually put in your bowl. Getting the perfect bowl does take practice, but the workers are always so willing to help. It's also nice to see a friendly face every time we come here (shoutout to the guy with the spiky hair!!). This place feels like a second home since we come here so often.",

It's insane that I used to physically smash all kinds of meat in my bowl like some kind of game. Over a year ago, I switched to a vegan diet and found my options for eating out to be so limited. You can imagine my excitement when I realized I only had to slightly modify my bowls to adjust to my lifestyle. Recently revisited the Scottsdale location I used to frequent in high school and I gotta say they've really stepped it up. I owe it all to Ben. The whole experience was so welcoming and friendly. It felt like a whole new place. Ben made sure everything was perfect and even offered to box my food up for me.",

I was a first timer and didn't know the squish thing or even had an idea what the wax paper was for until I saw OTHER PEOPLE displaying humiliating , embarrassing ,  disgraceful behavior crushing down food and then piling maybe as high as 10 inches above the bowl. Some people actually had to jump in the air to squish. ( I am sorry now I didn't video and send this up to You Tube.)  The meats and vegetables seemed fresh and I didn't notice any vegetables being canned (like at the Gag Us Chain) But I really didn't like the watered down sauces. Unlike the other stir fry places here you need to add maybe 7 ladle's of sauces to get the correct flavor and then you get a BOILED vegetable dish. YUCK!  I know MOST people enjoy coming here and doing the squish thing eating a boiled dish of food for approx. $10 but I can go to my favorite Chinese and get a rice bowl that taste better and is bigger and not crushed food for only $3.50 or spring for the whole lunch plate for only $4.95 so you won't be seeing me here again.  As for Stir Fry Places I like the independent Stir Fry place on Bell Rd is better than this place or the Gag Us Chain because I don't have to squish down food , I (don't) but I can go back and get as many Stir Fry's as I like at that place and the sauces aren't watered down so the food comes out better.   To each his own . Different Stir Fry's for different folks Eat what YOU like!",

Start at the register and pay, then walk your way through the line picking your frozen meats, veggies, and topping with noodles and broths to make your custom stir fry meal. You'll see the pros with parchment paper in hand, smashing down the goods to make room for more. My fave meat is the beef, I love tons of celery, cabbage, carrots. I personally skip on the noodles to go for the steamed white rice. Also love the egg drop soup and breaking up some wonton strips into that. You pay for a takeout box, but it is always worth it for me to take home another full meal. Expect YC's burps for the next few hours. Warn your loved ones.",

For those of you who do not know how this place works....you get a bowl and basically go to a buffet style set up where you pack raw meats and uncooked veggies into your bowl. You can put as much as you want, I wouldn't exactly say fit in your bowl, because the food is always overflowing. Once you have loaded up your bowl you pick the sauce(s) you want to use. There are recipes for different kinds of sauces available for you. After that, your food is cooked infront of you in about 3-5 minutes.   After that you take it to your table and enjoy...I would suggest filling your bowl up with a lot of noodles, even if your bowl is completely filled.",

I swear everytime I go the price for a bowl has gone up. I think the last time I was there for dinner a bowl was $11.50. The other reason is that you have to pay for a to-go box!!

I hadn't been here since college which was a lifetime ago.  So glad we came here.  It was really good.  You pick different various meats, veggies, noodles, sauces and they grill it all for you. I totally packed in the bowl.  The price also includes a beverage, side of rice (they have both brown and white), and desert afterwards.  What a deal!

He went above and beyond and management needs to make sure and take care of that guy as he was incredibly helpful and friendly.  Also as we walked out it seemed like he was just best friends with everyone he was assisting.  The food was delicious and the portions were more than enough. The kids were given a frozen yogurt to top it off.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and location!",

Their manager/supervisor walked up to our counter and asked said, \"What are you drinking, lemonade?\" I said, \"Yes.\" Next thing you know, he brings over a new filled drink. That was just the nicest thing. If I were allowed to give a tip, I definitely would have. No regrets coming to YCs. (Get an extra sauce bowl, and you'll be happy!)",

We received a great greeting, and everybody we spoke with was friendly.  You can tell that they all feed of of then Manager, Ben's positive energy.  The food was great, as always, and the restaurant, and restroom were clean.  Everything was well stocked. I take special notice of things like this, having owned and operated restaurants myself.  RECOMMENDATIONS: I know they are operating with a limited amount of counter space for items like cups, drink station, forks, etc.  With that being said, great idea putting a second fountain drink station in the dining room.  That really helps to lessen the crowding by the one closest to the cooking station.  I would suggest that they do place a caddy with more forks, knives and napkins over by the dining room fountain machine.  This will also help to prevent some of the congestion by caddy that is by he cooks.  Face it, how many times do we forget to get utensils, or they fall on the floor?  I know it happens to all of us.  Anyway, if you're in the area and have never tried YC's, I highly recommend it, and if you are familiar with it, enjoy!!!  See you soon YC's.",

Being a fitness finato, this is right across the street from Mountainside so any easy go to for lunch or dinner after a workout.   The place is very clean and offers a variety of meats, veggies, and grain/ noodles to cook on the grill. Its ready in minutes! To boot, there's complimentary soups in the event you're prone to becoming hangry. What is very special about this place to me, is they also cater to those who avoid carbs by making a \"noodle\" from kholrabi. I'm not particularly fond of spaghetti squash and these people nailed it with a veggie substitute.  Healthy, tasty... you choose your own spices and sauces. I'm a happy camper.",

    "text": "Well if you are good at packing food into a bowl, then you'll love this place. You can order a large or a small bowl... which I think you still can get as much as a large bowl if you pack enough into a small bowl. But anyway, you go through a buffet style line, stuffing meat, veggies and noodles into a bowl before they stir fry it for you. At this location, you start with the meats. There are beef, white chicken, dark chicken and Alaskan Cod. Compare to other places, the meat selection is quite limited. Even though vegetables which include tofu, baby corn, carrots, broccoli, bean sprouts, etc., are also a limited selection. There are a variety of sauces that you can mix or you can follow the recipe on the menu.  I guess the good thing is for $11, you can get a huge bowl of food. And there's free soup, which is ok... but you do also get a free drink (tea, soda) and you can buy yogurt for one dollar! So for the amount of money you pay, you get a lot of food. So I would say it's a good place to go for food. Just do it when it's not busy so you have more time to pack your bowl with ingredients. Be sure to make a mountain, get a lot of meat, a small portion of vegetables and keep piling whatever else on until it literally starts falling out of the bowl. LOL. And then you'll get your money's worth.",

Here's how it works: you get a bowl and you fill it up with anything you want, including sprouts, broccoli, carrots, onions, peppers, scary dehydrated meat and much more.    After all your ingredients are in your bowl, you then get to choose the sauces you want to put in it.  They have suggestions and recipes for you to follow, from sweet to super spicy. Or you can always make up your own.   Then the chef's wok it up for you and pour it all back into your bowl.  You can add some rice to it, sesame seeds or any other toppings that you want and choose a table to sit at.   My only warning is to vegetarians- you must ask the cook to clean off the grill before cooking yours because if you don't, you will get little pieces of meat in your bowl that have been left on the grill from someone else's meal!",

I always have leftovers to take home for another meal which is a bonus. The price also includes a drink, won ton chips, soup and rice if you like.

Everything looked fresh and none of the toppings looked like they had been sitting for more than a few minutes.  Cooking time is short and you can go back as often as possible.  Highly recomend for a quick bite that is good and filling",

You make your bowl, you put your sauce on, but where the heck are the spices? That's not even the worst part.  The worst part is they use water to cook the food and wash off all the sauce you put on.  Bland, bland, bland.  I'm from the mid-west and we know food.  You know the kind that sticks your ribs that actually has this thing called \"FLAVOR\"!  If you want a good mongolian place to eat, spend the money and eat at BD's Mongolian BBQ.  You have soooo much to choose from and you can even have a salad.  Pros: There isn't any unless you haven't eaten in weeks.  Cons: No flavor. Wash the little taste off. Felt sick after eating there. Tons of water in the bowl. Smelled like a toilet.",

So much food for your buck.  and it can be pretty healthy if you use the fresh veggies and you dont pack your bowl  with all noodles.  Hot tip: add a few shrimp for $1!!  My bf loves it since he is into the whole caveman thing and likes triple meat and they dont have a meat limit or charge extra for it.  Restaurant is always very clean.  Would recommend to everyone.  That whole shopping area is kind of dying out but this is its best kept secret.  Hopefully yc's is here to stay!",

I own my business named mammoth steak house I have been in the restaurant business for over 25 years and have never seen such a efficient worker I would steal him if I could but he's a loyal asset to this company. I would never steal an employee from another business unless they came willing but Ben savageau is loyal. I'm setting here watching him work he hasn't stop from helping customers with mixing sauces to cleaning the windows sweeping the floor and this is just in the 30 mins I've been seating here.

    "text": "For fast casual stir fry, YC's can't be beat. 6 things you should know before you go:  1. You pay first, and you can pay $0.50 for a to-go box. You'll want to do this. While your wallet is out, grab some cash now- and/or tip by card when you initially pay.   2. You'll be building your own bowl full of delish down a buffet-style line setup, so parents beware you'll want a free hand to help the shorter members in your fam.   3. There's a box of tissue papers at the start of the line; you'll want to grab one so you can smash down the ingredients as you fill your bowl because everything cooks down and you've already paid for a to-go box.   4. The sauces are all fantastic- and you can tweak them to your preference and mood. If you want to really take the flavor up a notch, let the impressive saucier skills of the staff on the floor help craft your sauce on-the-fly by asking you your preferences. There's always someone there to help before you get to the fun part.   5. Place your towering bowl on the counter to be stir fried and enjoy the show! That cash from earlier can be tucked in theIr tip jars here. If you tipped by card earlier, great.   6. Don't forget to add one or two soups, white or brown rice, and an included drink!   The staff is always great! This location is one of the better ones for sure!",

The only real downside is the long lines at peak time but it wasn't that bad.  You pack your meat first into the bowl.  The meat is freeze dried beef, chicken or fresh fish.  Shrimp can be added for ~$1 more    I got AYCE but was full on a large bowl.  You an also get brown or white rice, those crispy things end beverages.  They have soft serve ice cream for desert.   We went on a busy Saturday night.  It was a younger crowd but also families like us.  I highly recommend it.  It was about $60 for my family of four.",

There was a small selection of meats, only consisting of chicken, pork, beef, or fish. I am used to a more wide variety. I would also like a larger selection of sauces. As well as the fact that you have to pay for to go containers? We paid $26 for two meals...I would understand if it was all you can eat, but it's not.  Although, the bowls were a plus, bigger than other places.",

The two \"cooks\" took our food, threw it on the hot iron then took our sauce / seasoning. Put that on top then dumped a gallon of water on it, pushed it around for a minute and gave it to us. It was horrible! Flavorless and totally undercooked. The rice they offered looked like it was a week old and cold. My potatoes were still raw. I had to go back to the sauce and spice collection to get any flavor on my meal at all. Won't be back. Waste of money. Was there for the Saturday night car show. I now know the reason why McDonald's was so busy. Next time I'll wait in line there, its way more worth the time and money.",

Grab a wax paper and push down your meat because it will shrink so full up, push down and repeat three times.  Then grab your toppings and noodles.  You then come to a sauce bar and you follow the directions to create the flavor that goes into the food.  Take your tray to the cooks and they do their magic and cook it all up.   Good quality food, easy to put together if you read directions.   $12.95 includes one trip bowl, soup, drink and ice cream cone.   Not five stars only because you have to pay .50 for your to go container.   Give me a try.",

It's like buffet style stir fry, except you only get to go to the buffet once. And if you don't know that your bowl needs to be super filled and overflowing with the ingredients, it cooks up into just a very small dinner. Also, don't forget sauce, or sesame oil, or both, or it cooks wrong, because they only cook it with water.... however, if you follow the recipe screen, you could put it together nicely. Overall, the restaurant is not very clean, the tables were all super dirty and I had to clean ours with baby wipes. The baby seats roll and are not cleaned-- so moms beware. There is an ice cream machine, and it's included... so it got 2 stars from ice cream machine and eclectic restaurant idea.",

This is all that I kept hearing about the group I was with.  I had no idea what was in store for me.  And then we arrived.  Since I drove, I didn't have to pay (score!).  I was just told to grab a bowl, grab some wax paper, and stuff- HARD!  It just didn't make sense, until I was watching what was happening.  After I saw tons of meats (I think I stuffed the bowl 3/4 with meat), I didn't get too many vegetables, as I just really wanted meat and noodles.  Then next I stacked it with a mix of rice and wheat noodles- I was living dangerously.    Then next up, there is an area that you can make your own sauces (they have like 20-30 to choose from!).  I highly suggest dousing your bowl with liquids, as the pic suggests this stuff is cooked at high heat.  I regret not putting more sauce on mine.  Then when you are complete, you hand to a cook and they heat it up for you.  That is when you get extra rice, soup, and your drink.  The stuff comes out pretty quickly.  Then pick a spot and enjoy.  My beef/pork/noodle combo was pretty good, and was excited of the concoction.  Keep in mind this place is a trial and error type of place, and its up to you to find out what flavors work for you- I think that is unique for a place like this.  You can also get some shrimp, but it costs extra.",

On my visit last weekend, I witnessed a mother and daughter (in front of me in line) abusing the staff, breaking the rules, and being all around nasty people.    They had ordered the small bowl (which is plenty of food for even the largest of appetites), but began smashing literally pounds and pounds of meat with another bowl, and was politely told that using a second bowl to smash food is a no-no.  She reacted extremely rudely and continued doing it.  When the employee noticed her, he politely reminded her that it was against the rules.  At this point, her bowl is stacked 20 hands high, food is falling on the floor and all over the counter, and she continues adding more and more food... she yells at the employee \"you're harassing me, you don't need to tell me again, stop it! Stop it!  Stop it!  You're harassing me!\".  He offered her money back but she got angrier.  If it were me, I would have dumped her tray into the trash and tossed her out.    So, my lunch was spent sitting across from this horrible woman watching her eat herself to death.  My advice to the staff--don't let these people bully you.",

The front register is so close to the door that after ONE person walks in, the rest have to line up outside.   On to the food:  Hot and sour soup wasn't hot or sour. Definitely mediocre and needed strong shots of vinegar and hot sauce, which weren't in sight. For the Mongolian BBQ portion, the peanuts were whole, which makes no sense. Not chopped?  Also the sweet and sour sauce was so thin it just missed the mark. The main portions were fine, with good selections of proteins, veggies and sauces.   For ambiance: The TV had still pics of customers and was generally boring. In other words, no ambiance.   I can't recommend YC's at this point but I always give a place two tries, just in case they had an off day.",

Then another gentleman helped me at the sauce station by finding out what I liked and making it based off that. I will definitely be returning for more in the near future.",

You have a variety of meats and vegetables to choose from, the food line is always stocked and everything is extremely fresh! They are very accommodating if you have any food allergies- they even have coconut aminos in substitute for soy sauce. Ben is always present, very helpful and ensuring everyones satisfied! Stack your bowl high and give it a try because it always turns out delicious.",

    "text": "Let me start out by saying that this is the first negative review I've ever felt compelled enough to write after eating at hundreds of restaurants with my girlfriend. Also, as a server for multiple years I know what it takes to give good service. I visited with my girlfriend at 8pm, on October 23rd. I had already eaten dinner and was just going for a quick bite for my girlfriend after her shift at work. We go in and get greeted by a tired sounded host. I still gave him a 20 percent tip because I know how hard work can be sometimes. The total came out to 16 dollars! 16 dollars seems a little pricey for chicken and noodles but it's okay because it was only place nearby and she was hungry. After sitting down and letting her eat a bit, I get a fork to try a bite of her food. Once again, I already ate so I'm not hungry just wanted a bite and I get told, \"if you want to buy a bowl you can but don't eat off hers. WTF. The only time I am spoken too for my 20 percent tip is an inconsiderate comment about not be able to try my girlfriends food I paid for. Again I work in the food industry and I know sometimes there's bs rules but there has to be a better way to word that to someone who just tipped you. Ex, I'm sorry to say this sir but company policy says you can't share food, thank you. Well I was offended and my girlfriend knew so she just asked for a box. The same 'friendly man' let's her know that we usually have to charge for this but just this once he will give it to her for free. Like what. This is a consumer world so I urge all the consumers reading this to take your money elsewhere where it is valued. Believe me, I live in this area and there are about a million other places that treat you better than this. And you get more food at a cheaper price! Never again.  UPDATE: the owner has reached out and offered to make it up to me for the visit. I'm impressed with how quick they responded.  UPDATE: I finally decided to give the place a second shot and it was awesome!!!! The staff was super friendly and helped accommodate with sauces. I left my original review because I think it's important to learn from their mistakes.",

She explained how everything worked and even told us that for .50 extra we could take our food home in a to go box.  I was super excited because most of the time, my eyes are bigger than my stomach and I end up wasting half my meal.    The food was super fresh and delicious.  They even have someone to help you get the right sauce combination to ensure that your meal is done exactly right.  Rice and soup is included in your dinner.  Still hungry after?  They have frozen yogurt to satisfy your sweet tooth.  My family loves this place and we will definitely be back as often as possible.  SO HAPPY!!!!",

    "text": "This is probably one of my favorite places to go to in order to eat large amounts of meat. I use my whole body weight to smash down the meat into the bowl and then flip he meat sideways to make a wall to hold even more meat before adding vegetables and noodles on top. The selection of spices and marinades is quite impressive. I suggest not only getting two containers of flavor but to add it into the dish itself to give all he flavor you need to combat he heavy amount of meat. Muahahaha!  Another thing of note is that the bowls of food also come with drinks, soup, and rice on the side. During dinner hours it may come with unlimited ice-cream. After you finish eating you can pay for a to-go container for $0.50 to take the excess amounts of food home for another meal or two.",

She had an incredible attitude, was beyond helpful, and so kind and bubbly. Even if I hadn't liked the food, I would come back just for her.  If you come in and she's your cashier, you'll know it's her right away (they don't wear name tags). Just say hi and she'll be your new BFF forever.   Thanks to Katie/Katy, we'll be back!!",

    "text": "My family and I normally go to the one in Tempe and now I remember why. We went there Tuesday and we should have left as soon as we walked in. The cashier had the worst attitude and was extremely rude. We notified her that my husband has a gluten allergy well of course when we get to the grill the cook was less than pleased that he had to clean the grill for my husband and gave us a dirty look. If you are going to serve potatoes you must at least part cook them because we all added them to our bowls and they were raw. The soups were cold and gross, the red pepper flakes were so old that they were no longer red, who knows how long it's been there for. Cleanliness is definitely not a priority here. Had a hard time finding a table because they were dirty. My husband and brother had the all you can eat. My brother completely lost his appetite on his second bowl. You could see burnt specs on it and it smelled burnt really bad. I tasted it and had to spit it out because it was so gross. When I told the manager he just proceeded to make excuses about how maybe the grill hadn't been cleaned or that maybe my brother had added too much sauce. Then he finally admitted that the cook must have poured water on the hot grill and it removed all the burnt on old sauce and now cooked it into my brothers food. Then when I tell him about how rude the cashier was and how each time she walks by our table she gave me a dirty look. He said well she's just a bit dry, I said no she was flat out rude. He said yeah well I guess I can mention it to her. I went back and have read countless reviews about the rude staff. Wonder why this location doesn't care about customer service. To top it off my husband got extremely sick surely from the cook doing a shitty job at cleaning the grill and from all the sauce cross contamination. Definitely will never be back at this location.",

The concept is really cool, where they have buffet style tables with endless ingredients and topping that you mix and match to make your own stir fry bowl.   The first thing I noticed, unlike other businesses they encourage you to make your bowl as big as you can make it at one set price, even offering wax paper to condense your ingredients to make more room. They are all about feeding you here. and if you feel overwhelmed like I did, there is friendly staff happy jump in and help.  It's a fast food style set up, where you get your food and go sit down to eat, however the staff running around cleaning tables are making sure you have everything you need and even refilling your drinks so you dont have to get up.  Overall the food is amazing and I will definitely be back to try different combos, but what really blew me away was the service. Highly recommend",

    "text": "At first, I was taken back by the $12+ price tag for a bowl of food at a fast casual place. But then, I started peeling back the layers and really found this place to be super family friendly and full of extras.  For the cost of a large bowl, you also get a bowl of rice, bowl of soup, a drink and a frozen yogurt. To say I could've gotten a smaller bowl was a large understatement, but DO NOT get a small bowl. I repeat, do not get a small bowl. For just a single dollar more (and $.50 for the cost of a to-go box... so $1.50), you have a full lunch for the next day! And okay, if you have a smaller appetite, the smaller bowl would give you that as well.   The best part though and something I've not seen at any other restaurant EVER is how they price their kid meals. They base the cost based on age. My kids eat just about nothing, so taking them here and having to pay $5/each would have been a deal breaker. BUT, instead they charge $.55 per year of age, making my 3yo's meal (with the rice, drink, soup and frozen yogurt too!) is only $1.65. My 5yo's meal is only $2.75. Now we're talking.  I wish they had some sort of reward's club or something, but regardless, I'm excited about finding this place. The people were nice and helpful when it came to choosing sauces and the sauces were labeled with vegetarian and gluten free labeling (which is great because I am definitely the V).   We will be back, especially on my birthday when I get a free meal for signing up for emails!",

You decide what size bowl you want and pay, then go through a buffet of frozen/chilled veggies, meats, noodles, etc. you then add sauce (the chalkboard has different recipes you can try). While they're cooking your bowl, you can decide if you want rice, additional garnishes, soup, etc. A drink is included, too! The staff is nice and accommodating, even during rushes. You get a ton of food if you stuff your bowl full, and can take some home for leftovers.  The food was good, but not crazy amazing. It was similar to other Mongolian BBQ places.  Tips:  -use the parchment paper to squash your food down so you can fit more! -even if the line stretches out the door, don't run away! The line moves fast, and the wait is worth it!",

The place is well maintained and looks pretty modernized. The line may look crowded as you first walk in, but it moves pretty fast. For a place with a good cooked-to-order meal, it's still less of a wait than if you sat down to dine.   The meat shrinks during cooking, so make sure you get a double portion. There is an option for a 50 cent take out container, if you strategize and pile high enough (use wax paper at the start of the line to pack down the food) its petty easy to get enough for a second meal for later.  Words of caution though-the rice noodles are harder to stack, get wheat noodles if you have your heart set on seconds. Also, the entire bowl comes out very very hot at first when you sit down,   Edit: I was originally perplexed to see the chicken frozen in rolls, but received a message from the owner who thoughtfully described the preparation to plate process, to create fresh chicken pieces that are ready to easily be cooked the day after they are received. Now I am even more sold on this place.  .",

When it came to the sauces, Kim was able to make perfect recommendations and help us based on what we wanted - so thanks Kim!  Everything was fantastic and we both look forward to coming back for more.",

It's super basic in concept fantastically nuanced in execution: just load up your favorite proteins, veggies, and noodles in a bowl, add your own custom made sauce then hand the whole thing off to a chef that quickly cooks your custom bowl!   Add soups, wontons, rice, a drink, ice cream, etc. Lots of food!!!  I am no mathematician but I met there are something between a million and an infinite number of choices in making your bowl.  So delicious.   Options for small, Large, and unlimited bowl at lunch and dinner pricing. To go orders are also accommodated.   Staff keeps the place super clean which is harder than it sounds with as many people working their magic while crafting the perfect bowl.  Ben, the Manager, is awesome.  You watch him taking care of every group in the place like they were the only guests!  Really a nice thing to experience particularly in a fast casual dining experience.",

My wife and I nearly passed on this as we have a newborn and weren't sure how we were going to prep our bowls. We decided to make it happen as the food is great.  As we entered to order, the nice staff member at the cash register offered a highchair which would hold the car seat and was on all wheels to get down the line.  When I finished loading up my bowl, the nice staff member at the end of the line offered to make my sauce which I gladly accepted and she gladly made from memory, also my wife's.  After the fine gentlemen on the grill finished my bowl, a nice gentleman in a gray shirt offered to wheel my son while I carried the food. I can assume he was the manager, but he was very involved with the customers.   As stated above, the food is great and the service was exceptional. This team was on point and took great care of all the customers in the restaurant.  I would also add, they have soft serve cup or cone included.  Very fine work from you all.",

They have added a ton more healthier options such as more veggies and even different noodles for those who cannot eat the regular wheat noodles. The sauce bar is incredible with so many different types of sauces to custom make along with a list of how to make pre made flavors. The food is always cooked fresh and hot in front of you and they always have soup and rice for sides. The prices have gone up and they still unfortunately charge for a to go box but overall this place has remained the same great food and a better upgraded look.  Also, if you happen to go on a Saturday night, there is a cool vintage car show that's in the parking lot every weekend:)",

YC's just didn't compare, a lot less ingredient and sauce options (about half of what HuHot offers) and it felt more \"fast food\" than a restaurant. What ingredients they do have looked quality and fresh though. You get soup, chips, rice, and a soda with your noodles for about $13 so the prices were very reasonable for what they do offer. The soups (a beef soup and a chicken veggie soup) did not look appetizing so I skipped on that.  An employee does the sauces for you and followed recipes which kind of took away from the fun of creating your own dish and being able to add what you like. Overall the dish was okay but nothing remarkable flavor wise. Was really looking for more bold flavors you find in traditional Mongolian sauces.  Compared to other Mongolian restaurants I have been to this was just not as authentic seemed very \"fast food\" vibe with the interior layout and decor. Even the cooking time was really fast- nice if you're in a hurry but not great for quality of food.",

    "text": "I stopped by here this past Wednesday evening with my wife, her parents and her brother for dinner.  The inside of YC's Mongolian looks like like most Mongolian restaurants with a large buffet like bar, a couple of circular grills and then some seating.  How YC's differs from our Mongolian Grills back in Pittsburgh is that their meat is frozen and they also have mixed sauce suggestions.  If you have never been to a Mongolian grill before the premise is simple.  You are given a bowl that you fill up with whatever meats, vegetables and carbs that you want.  Then you pair a sauce with it and it gets cooked on the grill and handed back to you.  On this occasion I went with the unlimited bowl while my wife went with the large bowl.  All of my trips produced very similar items in the fact that I got chicken, beef, water chestnuts, broccoli, cauliflower, bell peppers and pineapple.  The only differences between my bowls were the sauces as I twice went with Thai peanut curry and once missed their spicy sauce all while adding chili oil to each. All three times I ended up enjoying my bowl.  It's nice to be able to customize it to your own personal preferences.  By the time I left the restaurant I was incredibly satisfied and stuffed.  Then within an hour of finishing eating I had some issues and my wife had different issues the next morning.  Can I prove that they were YC's fault?  Nope I cannot, however, I have my suspicions.    The bottom line for me is that I probably wouldn't come to YC's again in the future.  While I was happy and satisfied with the food while I was there, I certainly wasn't later in the evening turning a 4 star review into 3 stars.  UPDATE:  The owner of YC's contacted me on Yelp the day after my review was posted .  He let me know that he was glad that we enjoyed our meal but sorry that we had issues afterward and that they take food safety seriously.  He also gave me a number to contact him.  That alone should show you that the owner does care about his establishment and what goes on their and gives me a much more favorable view of YC's.",

As we silently ate our flavorless bowls we thought about you the whole time. We missed your large portions and comforting smells. I also missed your lower prices. Your sauce selection is perfect and I love how your meats are frozen and thinly sliced. I never had a problem filling my bowl with your fresh vegetables and delicious meats, but had to try Genghis because it is closer to my house. I will never make that mistake again.. I will drive to you, happily. Will you forgive me? We will never, ever stray again. In the world of Mongolian BBQ, you are everything to me.   Yours Truly,  Kevin   PS- you should open a location near the 101/17.. there are tens of thousands of us up here that would appreciate it.",

    "text": "I've spent years out in other states devouring their takes on Mongolian BBQ, and yet for some reason YC's takes the cake. Everywhere I've gone defaulted to an AYCE style, so color me surprised when the best I've had was largely single order/take out.  If you aren't familiar with the format, you prepay for either a small or large bowl, so you don't have to worry about check at the end. You start with sliced meats, that they graciously provide paper to smash it all down and maximize space. You can dry spice if you want, then follow up with plenty of vegetables. What impressed me about YC's is the option of multiple noodles - after dozens of iterations, this is the only one with anything outside egg noodles - and the udon, rice, and wheat are all kickass! Then you finish off your sauce mixture in a separate bowl and you're off to the races.  I've tried the all you can eat out of habit a couple times, and I've found it not worth it. The norm is basically stacking your bowl as high as physically possible, with some of the most impressive bowls over twice the height you start with! When you get a quick stir fry from a bowl that big, with rice, soup, wontons, and ice cream at dinner, a large is actually ridiculously filling.  Not only am I a fan of their wheat noodles, but their sauce selection is straight up the best. With options like lemongrass, black pepper sauce, and Spicy Hunan on top of your regular selection, you can create something that can hit pretty much any flavor palate.   When all my friends in high school kept inviting me to go to YC's, I passed out of sheer ignorance. Never again will I give up a chance at some of the best tasting and valued Asian food in Scottsdale period.",

    "text": "For about $12 you get a huge portion of customized stir fry and fountain drink for lunch. You can put as much frozen, raw slices of meat and fresh veggies as you want into your bowl and they cook it for you on a large, flat circular grill. The wait is usually no more than 8-10 minutes. YC's is excellent. I've visited many times over the years around the holidays. I usually eat as much as I can at the restaurant and when I fail to eat it all, I buy a to-go container for $0.50 for the leftovers.  It's too bad they haven't resolved the whole sharing or to-go issue after two decades. I'm sad to hear that the employees have been rude and/or confrontational to customers - especially to those who have kids that simply don't eat very much or to people who have much better portion control than myself. They've never been rude to us.  I've never gotten sick (I feel for those who have gotten seriously ill). I think they do a good job with keeping the meat shavings/rolls frozen at a safe temperature. It's seriously the best looking meat selection I've seen at Mongolian Grill places. Depending on who goes before you in the line, the veggies and sauce can get really messy. I've spilled sauces and dropped veggies all over the counter. Usually, the employees are quick to wipe the counters clean. For food safety reasons, remember to get a sheet or two of the wax paper at the beginning of the line. One to push down the raw meat in your bowl. And another sheet to push down your veggies. And please don't let the veggie tongs or your own fingers come into contact with the contents of your bowl.  Make sure you wash your hands before eating if you are especially susceptible to food illness.  I agree with another reviewer's comment that the hot and sour soup was weak. I feel like it has been better in past years. The rice is so-so. The crispy wonton strips are nice crunchy addition to either your soup or stir fry.  Don't forget to check out the cilantro, peanuts, and other toppings right before you give over your bowl to the cooks.  If you have any food allergies, like a peanut allergy, then this is not the place for you.",

So as I go to pay, I tell her I'd like a soda with it and she tells me soup, rice, entree, bevarage and dessert are included for $10! Oh my gosh, what a deal!

YC'S used to be one of my favorite spots to grab a quick meal, until , about 10yrs. ago when  I found out the mystery behind all of my illness was food allergies to wheat, corn and cow dairy.  I tried to eat there and just use my GF Tamari, but there was still the issue of the grills having too much residue from other meals.  Recently my daughter informed me they had made a big change in handling special allergy needs and she was excited for me to go there.  If you deal with food allergies you will understand my skepticism, so, it took some time before I managed to try it out.  I am here to tell you, it was fabulous!   They are SO incredibly accommodating and helpful.  The staff were all cheerfully helpful.  Everyone was knowledgeable and aware of ingredients and respectful of my needs. The hostess put an allergy alert card on my tray and assured me I would be assisted with the sauces, which I Was. The grill cook was cleaning the grill before I even got to the counter.   He was cheerful and friendly,( and grinning at the fact that I was taking photos).  My food was beyond delicious! I had Panang Thai sauce, extra spicy.  They even have rice noodles!  I am So, so,so excited to be able to eat here again.

You will be full when you leave thats for sure!",

The first time I went they helped me get started and gave me a free togo box, normally they charge 50 cents for it (which sounds weird, but isn't until you go).  This is a build your own Asian Meal place! AWESOME!! You can pick your meat, your veggies and your sauce and they cook it up for you- so fun and so yummy- each time you go you can get what you want, but switch up the sauces or keep it the same and since it is build your own, you will definitely have leftovers and they are just as good the second time around!",

    "text": "I love this place. Unfortunately I don't live that close so have to make a special drive there when I get the craving for Mongolian bbq. I feel I'm pretty talented at getting the most food I can into that bowl. I get the white meat chicken, their choices are chicken-white or dark, beef, pork and Alaskan cod. The meat is lightly frozen and curled so when you put in the bowl you have to smash it down. Don't worry they have parchment paper there fire you too do this so your not touching raw meat. Then you choose all your veggies and off you want some seasoning. I always get a ton of bean sprouts, carrots and mushrooms but they have a lot of other veggie choices. Then choose your noodles rice, udon or wheat. I get a mixture of what and udon. I put the noodles on the bowl for the sauce because with all the goodies I load into my food bowl it's just too high otherwise. For my sauce I love to use the teriyaki recipe slightly modified, I leave out the oil and double the garlic and ginger accounts. I'm Italian can't have too much garlic and I love ginger. Then you bring it to the wok where they cook it. It's so freaking good. Then it comes with a drink, rice if you want and soup. I pass on the soup but always get a bowl of brown rice, it's yummy.  Just fyi 50 cents for takeout container which I always purchase cause I get the large bowl and my left others last at least 2 meals. They have soft serve ice cream for a dollar. I highly recommend this place. Wrong tone of the season but during spring training games at the salt river fields it's great to walk to after or before catching the game. I did this twice this year after watching an early DBacks game.",

I would like to say that the staff was pleasant like in other reviews, but I really had no interaction with them outside the cashier.  It was the customers ahead of me that taught me what to do (yeah, I'm a solo eater!).  It felt like a bit of camaraderie going on with patrons.  How cool is that?!

    "text": "My wife and I tried this place this evening.  The only reason I don't give it a 1-star rating is because neither of us died.  Otherwise, it was a poor experience and we won't be returning.  First, When we get our bowls and begin filling them up, there's no shrimp.  I ask about shrimp and am told it's $1 extra.  So, shrimp costs $1 extra from the $11.85 we each paid but you're forcing us to buy the ice cream and drink as part of the $11.85?  I should have asked if they can subtract $1 for each of our meals because neither of us wanted the ice cream and subtract another $2 from my wife's meal because she only drinks tap water.  Bottom line here, I resent that we're being forced to buy the extras as they're included in the price, but we're to be charged more if we want shrimp.  Hey, Genghis Grill down at Tempe Marketplace has shrimp on the bar and doesn't charge extra and doesn't force you to buy a drink and ice cream.  Second, the various sauces were poorly marked with bowls of sauces with no corresponding label or a label with no corresponding sauce.  There were even sauces that were obviously not what the corresponding label indicated.  It was difficult to know what we were putting with our bowls.  Third, my wife didn't finish all her bowl so she asked or a container to take it home.  They charged her $0.50 for a takeout box.  Seriously????  We won't return and will instead drive the extra 5 miles or so to the Genghis Grill at Tempe Marketplace the next time we want Mongolian BBQ.",

He greeted us, helped us as we learned how to load up our bowls and also made unique sauces adjusted to our taste preferences. He was super friendly and made sure we were happy with our selections. As this was our first visit, he was very helpful in guiding us through the process. The food tasted amazing. I ordered a large bowl and probably only ate about 1/4 of it (and I can eat!!), this is why paying for the to-go box up front comes in handy. I had enough left over for 2 more meals! I will definitely make the 2 hour trip back to Scottsdale just to eat here again - great food, great service, great prices!",

He offered coconut aminos for my soy allergy and he had the cooks clean the stovetop because I'm vegetarian. I watched him walk around and engage with every other table along with ours in personal conversation. It was extremely amazing and you do not see service like this anywhere.

I can always tell when amateurs are in line, because they don't quite know how to smash the meat and other ingredients down to make the largest bowl of noodle goodness as humanly possible.  I know the recipe for my favorite Mongolian sauce by heart and I will drive many miles just to taste those warm noodles.  I know there used to be a few more choices of veggies and things on the line, but after talking to a manager, he told us about their rising food cost which caused them to have to take away some of the things that were previously offered.  Hey, you gotta do what you gotta do to keep costs under control.",

Although the options appear to be healthy for the most part, I'm very concerned about the cleanliness of this establishment. We even overheard one customer saying his friend became ill the last time they ate here. The trays had grease and sauce all over them from previous customers, soup bowls had old-hard food remains in the bottom. There was food, oils, sauces and spices tossed everywhere along the food bar. I needed a shower after just walking through the food bar. My already dirty tray was again slid through more sauce and debris at the cooking station.

You then put your sauce in a separate bowl (use the recipes they have listed!) Then give it to the guy to cook it for you (takes about 5min) I'd strongly suggest to either use 2 sauce recipes, or double the recipe you have Once you get you're bowl back you will notice your food shrunk in half It will still be way more than you can probably eat Just in case it's not enough food, your order comes with unlimited rice, soup, chips, soft drink, and cheap yogurt you want! :)  Tips: Use the wax paper to squish all the food possible into your bowl!!! Look at the people around you if you feel at all lost (really helped me) They only charge $.50 for a To-Go Box because people could easily fill a box with some of the unlimited rice or chips if they wanted to. (please don't do it though)  Everyone here was extremely friendly. Even the cooks said hello to me! This is an excellent spot if you want to show somebody you know of a small unique restaurant (like on a date with an outgoing girl, or a guy that enjoys eating a ton)!!! Me and my girlfriend would love to come once a month but it's a little too far for us.  Don't come if: You hate buffet style restaurants It's a Saturday night and you hate awesome car shows (parking lot) You're a picky eater that doesn't like getting their food squished together You only plan on eating a little",

It's a great place to go when you want a filling, healthy meal for lunch.  I've always been a fan of DIY/Cook it yourself places. (I.E. Korean BBQ and Hot pots.)  I usually try stuffing as many ingredients into the bowl, sometimes it requires punching down the frozen slices of meat you first throw in. And you have to get a lot of sauce otherwise you're not going to taste anything. When I first came here I had no idea on what sauce combinations to use, its nice they put up a sign above the grill so anyone new to YC's can start out from and branch out adding different combos.",

For $13, you get to choose your ingredients to make your own custom noodle, hot soup, free soft drinks and two flavors of ice cream.   It is best if you read some of the reviews here before going to the restaurant so that you know what and how to pick and how to make your noodle because it can be pretty overwhelming for newbies.   Don't be afraid to load up your bowl-- Meat (Chicken, Pork, Beef, Fish), Veggies and 3 types of noodles. When it comes to choose sauces, just look up and read up the flavors to get some guidance. IMPO, sticking with a pre-defined flavor is a good idea than just randomly mixing a whole lot of sauces. It is going to be a lot of food, so plenty of leftover to take home as well.  Tip the cooks near the grill and enjoy!!",

As a result, I didn't have enough sauce.  In my case, that was a good thing because the sauce I did have tasted like crap, so more of the same would have been even crappier.  As for the ingredients, lots of choices with fresh veggies.  I have to say the meat looked unappetizing to me.  In fact, I had to ask my husband what the hell it was.  I guess it's a good thing you don't see piles of freshly sliced meat, else it might not be so fresh after all.  But in its frozen to minus 500 degrees F state, I found I opted for more veggies.  Two sizes available.  I went with the large, crammed my bowl full until it resembled a small mountain, and then wasted over half of it.  So get the small unless you want leftovers or you haven't eaten in several days.",

    "text": "I was really impressed by the friendliness of the staff and the selection of proteins and veggies! The part that didn't work so well? The sauces. Many were hard to get to and even harder to dip due to the height of the containers and the sneeze proof glass. I made a total mess (but I cleaned it up too!)Anyway, I didn't follow the \"sauce guidelines\" listed on the wall and just went rogue. This wasnlt a good idea. I ended up with a really bland, soupy mess. TGFS (thank goodness for siracha) or this would have been a big waste. The meat fish and veggies were great, but I made the mistake of adding wheat noodles- BLECH! No taste and kinda gummy-kinda hard.     I would go back and stick with meat and veg and follow directions on the sauce cuz this place is clean and could be both healthy and tasty if done the right way.",

    "text": "Since I am an avid fan of the pavillions car show I go to ycs and have for over 6 yrs.  let me explain why you see an update from 6 months or a year ago the and one from 6 months before that.   I've been involve in the restaurant industry for more than 10 years in one capacity or another.  I also have been trained in the old school French ssicsl fine dining so I know a little about more than just being a foody.      You don't go to ycs  for a sit down dining type abiance. It is the food yet also everything that incorporates good fun and a great Experiance.    Servers?  Well not exactically,  but they will help you make decisions based on what you tell them you like in flavoreds or spices they aren't afraid to point you in a direction it's your choice to take it.      The food is cold and fresh and dated on the Cambros they use for storage.  They will scrape the circular grill if requested and usually do on a repeats basis.  Stack the food high and lots.   It will shrink as cooked. But Personally I use a small soup bowl for my ladles of sauces.   I have never been disappointed with any other people here.   Employees and guests alike.  Good food.  Fun atmosphere and above all else.  Consistancy.  Good.  Logistically you Don't have a place they does the business they do with out being above average.  There's just to many other restaurants to go to in the area if the wee just average  I see reviews here like..its too loud.  Not healthy etc.  yes moderation is the key.  Case and points. I will sometime's not use any sauces or noodles.  I pile on chx and spinach and veg with some ginger and garlic and it's awesome and for 10.00 I can eat for two days.",

She further helped us with the sauces, making sure we had the flavor we wanted. Additionally, we observed the manager sweeping the floor, assisting customers and interacting with customers and his employees in such a way, that it was clear the employees were a team... They seemed to love their work... Which spills over into a welcome overall environment! Good food, healthy, tasty...upbeat! Great lunch. Thanks!",

    "text": "My husband and I ate here after the car show last weekend.  The concept is part fun, part weird: watching them cook your food = fun. Trying to concoct your own meal, complete with spices, sauces, oils and \"squishing\" = a little weird.  The staff was very friendly and helpful. They explained the \"squish\" concept when I told them I was a first timer, and there was a helpful gentleman at the end of the line to help me make up a sauce.  I was weirded out by the shaved, frozen meat. It makes sense that they need to keep it this way (frozen to maintain safety, shaved thin to cook fast), but it is still a bizarre sight and I was hesitant to use it. All the veggies were super fresh, so I loaded up on those.  All you can eat soup, wontons, rice and soft serve. I was disappointed that the soups were so basic (chicken noodle and beef vegetable? How about some egg drop!?) The wontons were ok and the soft serve was meh. Didn't bother with the rice.  My problem was that, at the end of it all, I had a large bowl of not-that-great stir fry. How many times do you need to experiment until you find a sauce/spice/oil/cooking wine ratio that actually tastes good? THIS IS WHY I EAT OUT, PEOPLE....so I can get a guaranteed yummy meal, not take my chances!  And as another review stated, it is super odd to go down this buffet line watching people pile, stuff and cram food into these bowls, trying to get every last ounce of their money's worth. Yes, it shrinks a little while cooking, I'm sure. But people were acting like animals with the wax paper and extra bowls, using their entire body weight to smoosh their own food. Not an appetizing sight.  I might be willing to give it one more shot with another sauce compilation, but after that I think I'm done.",

    "text": "Ate at this restaurant Saturday november 14 and had my leftovers on Sunday november 15. Tuesday morning I woke up violently ill and could not hold in food or fluids all day tuesday.   Went to the urgent care tuesday evening and they promptly sent me to the ER to be treated for severe dehydration caused by \"probably a food borne bacteria.\" I just finished my three day antibiotic course and am feeling much better, but now that I have had time to look at the facts and speak with the Maricopa County Department of Health, I can confidently say that my horrific three days of food poisoning were undoubtedly caused by YC's Mongolian Grill.  The fact that I was told someone else got a case of E.Coli with bloody stools just about a week before my poisoning really shored it up for me. YC's is apparently serving tainted or contaminated food. I would not recommend eating at this establishment. I must also make it clear that my noodles which I took home were transported from the restaurant to my refrigerator (20 minutes) and kept in the refrigerator until they were microwaved and consumed.",

Always put extra sauce because your meal will come out dry if you dont.  They have rice and soup too, but I never get it because you get so much food! You get to have frozen yogurt after and its perfect because you get a little sweet at the end.  I love it...i just wish it were closer to my house but I will make the drive...",

    "text": "I can't really hype about YC's. It's good, and I'll hand them that, but it's not a 4-5 star place you should take a date. It's build your own meal and have some hispanic men with sticks toss it around a hot circle.   The meat is so thinly shaven that once it cooks down it's like digging through to find a needle in a hay stack to find it. They do have TOFU for all you veggie heads out there, but I wouldn't trust the grill they toss it around on. It's not like they clean it after every use. Plus who knows what's in the sauces.  The noodles you can load on like no other. As you stand in line, you will see people building their food dome. Pretty self explanatory.  The noodles are awesome thick chewy. -Definitely- ask for a to-go box upon ordering, unless you really think you can finish that mother load of carbs. This stuff is better as leftovers anyway. Way worth the 50 cents.   Soup is just okay, but you gotta love those addictive fried won-tons. I love grease. You can feel the grease smash back out of them when you bite into the crispy shell. Again, you can get as many as you want. Same with a bucket of brown and white rice they have for serve.  During dinner hours they allow you to have free self serve/soft serve frozen yogurt from their machines. The cones are junk. Nasty cardboard like cones, and the frozen yogurt is VERY \"so so\". Not worth it if you ask me.   Even though they have tons of great perks, it's still just a place to get stuffed on cheap food. Lunch $8, Dinner $10.",

    "text": "It has been several months but I hadn't lost the formula (80/10/10 - veggies, meat, noodles).  Pat down some chicken-turkey (no taste difference as far as I can tell) with the wax paper.  Load up with mostly veggies (more green than red or white), add some wheat noodles to fill the bowl to the brim.  Follow with the sweet and sour mix but add some extra vinegar and orange sauce.  Add some pineapple and all set to have it grilled.  Fill a small bowl with peanuts and another small bowl with pineapple.  Fill the large red plastic drinking vessel with ice and low cal lemonade.  Then chow down...  My formula has more or less stayed the same since being introduced to YC's by Mike T and/or Erik T.  Both took different approaches and none tasted like the other despite selecting choices from the same line.  Amazing how three related people ended up with very different meals especially Erik T with cod fish and Mike T with who knows what kind of sauces except they were very dark.",
