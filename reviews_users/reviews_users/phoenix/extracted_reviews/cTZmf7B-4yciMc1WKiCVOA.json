Waited for half hour to give my order. No! I will not give a lower star because they were packed and I had to wait.  I ordered the white fish sandwich, pricey but delicious. Met a young couple. They were extremely nice and allowed me to join them and talk to them. No, this is not Los Angeles, where people are antisocial!  Enough of my rant! Place is awesome, food is tasty, and people and customer were extremely nice!",

Intimate, unassuming location in a residential corner.",

We got there around 9:45 ordered the Poutine fries w/ gravy on the side, Mac and cheese, the carol, big Jim, and the welcome burger.   The seating was spread out and basically just a hangout spot for a bunch of hipsters. We didn't know if they were doing orders in order or just unorganized because we literally waited an hour before we asked when our order was going to be done. No one even asked us how we were doing or if we needed anything during our waiting time. I'm all about customer service and the lack of it turned all of us off.  We got our food at 10:50, probably because we didn't look happy when we asked when our food would be done. The dishes were good but not worth the hour wait, mind you today is just a Wednesday. We will not be back.  What made us even more upset is the fact that one of the employees brought out the couples food next to us, within 20/30 mins of them being there AND gave them free drinks. Maybe it's because we're Asian and we were the minority at the diner.",

I got the Hurricane and my friend got a Whiskey Sour. Then the food came out fast. Maybe too fast.   We both got a burger. One was the one with the jalapeno slaw and the other one with peanut butter. I kid you not, the biggest concern was that the middle of the burger was practically raw. There was no grilled crisp to the burger and even the outside of the burger wasn't very hot at all. I'm hoping they were just busy and this was an off night because that was really disappointing.  To give them the benefit of the doubt, I did order a burger with peanut butter on it and it was the first time I've ever tried something like this but not only did I feel underwhelmed, my friend did also.  To top it off, the bill was over $20 and the food was sub-par. Will I try this place again? Possibly with some liquid courage.",

    "text": "Love the atmosphere at this place, and the fact that the food is great, too, makes this one of our favorite neighborhood haunts. With just a few counter seats inside the trailer that houses this diner-style joint, you may want to order through the window and post up at one of the many outdoor tables, especially if you're with a group. Try a cocktail to start while you wait for your order - they're strong but delicious, typically served in mason jars or goblets, which matches the laid back vibe of the place.   There are a number of great dishes here, but among the best are the Fried Green Tomato sandwich and the poutine. The tomatoes are perfectly fried, light and crispy, with greasy flavor enhanced by the slightly sweet zest of corn relish and the subtle heat of chipotle sauce. Served on toasted local bread, it's got just the right amount of crunch and flavor. Plus, it's unlike any sandwich you'll see on other menus around town. The poutine is also a must-try. Served with country-style gravy and perfectly distributed melted cheese on top of thin, crispy fries, it's not a traditional poutine but one of the most delicious versions in the Valley. If gravy's not your thing, the fries are just as delicious on their own.   Other highlights include the fried chicken sandwiches, which come in a number of variations featuring ingredients like honey, country gravy, and buffalo sauce. Although the biscuits they're served atop can be a bit dense, the chicken is perfectly moist and flavorful and never too greasy. The side of watermelon completes this southern-themed dish. And, if you're a burger lover, try one here. The meat is well-cooked with great flavor and the patties are perfectly portioned.   The service at Welcome Diner is casual but friendly and efficient. You'll get real attentiveness at the counter and maybe some small talk. Don't expect anything too formal - this is definitely a neighborhood joint, but you can tell the staff takes pride in their place of employment. And why wouldn't they? After all, Welcome Diner is a True neighborhood gem.",

    "text": "Part of the charm of this place is that it is in a poor residential neighborhood in downtown Phoenix, not far from 7th St.  Also, you could easily drive by and not even notice it exists.  So charming and the loveliest of dives you will ever visit (or shizzhoels as I call them).  Now, about the food and experience.  When you walk inside there is only about 8 or so counter seats in what looks like a converted studio home/living room.  The feeling when you walk in however, is that someone beamed you into the 1950's.  Authentic and totally retro.  Now, the best for last... the food is not your typical diner food.  Much more creative and original than any diner I have ever been to.  And being from NY I KNOW diners!  Practically grew up in them.  This diner, while having a VERY limited menu (when compared to any NY diner), each and every dish is incredible.  Try the Big Jim!  It will wow you... Fried Chicken breast  with cheddar, bacon, homemade biscuit buns and gravy.  Wowah!  (Oh, and definitely not the dish or the place to be if you wanna eat healthy!  More the once in a blue moon calorie splurge place... at least for me.)  Oh and order off the menu the \"Cannibal Fries\".  Simply off the chain.  Fresh cut potato fries with caramelized onions, cheddar and homemade russian dressing.  (Deep Breath!)",

John Luther (Awesome name, btw!) took our order and was very friendly the entire time. The three of us ordered the No Way Jose Burger which came with a choice of fries or cole slaw. The price is pretty reasonable: $10.75 for the burger and fries. We each also ordered 3 Hess Cream Ales and 3 burgers for a grand total of $55.82.   The atmosphere was very chill and the clientele, for the hour, was very friendly. We will definitely be coming back here again soon! Especially since it's only a few blocks away!

But Welcome Diner unquestionably deserves all of them.    Not sure what to get?  Start with the Welcome Burger your first time there.  They are better than what you want when you're looking for a really great American burger.   Can't wait to try the biscuits next time.  Atmosphere is laid back.  Bathroom is tiny. Food is very tasty, classic honemade yumness.  Experience it!",

I was gonna try the beignets, but I was in the middle of asking the guy behind the counter about them, and he kind of drifted off and forgot to answer me. The inside is very small with about 8 seats and a small air conditioner that won't reach you if you sit by the door. If I ate here again, I'd order to go. 5 stars for the food.",

The seating is first come first serve which isn't a lot, they have 3 massive tables that can be shared unless a huge party is there and just sit to chat for a couple of hours. Seemed as though the kitchen was understaffed, took forever for our food. The menu is super small, burgers, salads and every which way for biscuits and gravy. The burger was okay, it was a burger. It wasn't special or even that flavorful. I ordered a side of Brussels instead of fries (I know, who does that) after a long wait they bring out burger & fries, we tell the server and he takes my entire plate, brings back just the burger. 5 minutes later the Brussels come out. They were black. Fully burned.  If I returned it would be to take up seating, wasn't impressed by the food or the fact they take your whole plate back just to return the one piece. Did they reuse the fries?",

I was in a hurry so didn't check my bag which I usually do but didn't this one time. I know I asked for fries but didn't get them. The burger wasn't anything special, I could have made it  at home. For $17 I was thinking wow I must be getting a big ass burger. Lol it was big but kind of flat and very greasy. There is parking off the street or you can park in the lot next to them next to a water station. Pros: I learned my lesson about looking at what I'm paying for! And the art on the fence was nice. That's about it.",

Cool vibe. Mostly outdoor seating, never experienced this place in mid-summer, must be scorching--then again, it's only open at night when it's cooler.  Oh, and yeah, only open after 5pm (typically). I'm there now, surrounded by all college age kids as I type this. EDIT: I felt I must update and drop a star because 1) the outdoor furniture is extremely old and weathered, and not just rustic, and 2) there were quite a few ants on the narrow table/bench where I sat outside.  I can understand these things being \"normal\" for \"normal\" situation outdoors, but \"normal\" doesn't get 5-star ratings. They should get refurbished furniture and go crazy on insect control.",

It was phenomenal. I love that the side dish is watermelon, what a great refreshing side. We also got a side of poutine fries that were delicious. It's a little messy and sticky, but totally worth it. I am looking forward to trying more from the menu. The staff is super friendly and great customer service.

A perfect place to have some cocktails and spend hours talking with friends while sitting on picnic tables under string lights. I recommend going at night.

It's a converted house in the middle of a neighborhood, but it looks like it's straight out of a movie. The food is good and the menu is unique; I love the variety. My favorites on the menu are poutine and the mac and cheese, but I've heard good things about every other menu item! I will say, wait times can become incredibly long. The staff seems incredibly hard working, but they have a small kitchen and are very popular which makes for long wait times. If you're willing to wait, Welcome Diner is worth it!",

Got there and checked out the menu - interesting assortment of foods.  Everybody's happy!  Got our order in and sat back down...the rain started to move from a drizzle to steady...no cover outside (just shade cloth) and all 9 of the inside seats were taken.  Switched our order to takeout and sent everyone to the car.  Got the order and headed home.  Almost none of the fries survived the drive (we were hungry, and they were really tasty!)  I ordered the Bumblebee - that's a southern fried chicken breast (boneless) biscuit sandwich.  It had dijon mustard, pickles, and honey...not really my flavor profile - not sure if it was the mustard or the pickles, but just missed by a bit for my taste (biscuit was great, chicken was very good).  Everybody enjoyed their orders, and we finished up with beignets - great way to finish off!!!",

We ordered six different burgers or sandwiches and everyone was happy with what we ordered. I had an additional side of brussels and it was a healthy portion AND delicious. This place is out of the way for me, but I would make it a destination spot after any of our downtown adventures. It's perfect that they are open so late. I was afraid that parking would be an issue, but we didn't have any problems even though the place was full and our party arrived in 5 different vehicles. Can't wait to try their brunch menu!",

You walk up to order at the little window,  sit down,  and they'll bring your meal out. Takes a good 15+ minutes to make your food , so a nice wait.   The poutine uses cream gravy instead of brown.  Different,  but still good.  The pork bbq fries were great. The pulled pork was heated up on the griddle which gave it a nice crisp. Tasty too!  The beignets were the star of the night. Wow! Outstanding taste and quality.  Make sure to get those.  Good place, try it out!!",

My biggest DISAPPOINTMENT was that when i finished my food and after wanting beignets for a few months I asked my very friendly server for some and they stopped making them a year or so ago!!!!

We shared poutine fries ( which were so yum ) my husband had the jambalaya ( talk about flavor town) and I had the Big Jim biscuit which was incredible. I had a drink and my husband had a beer. The food was so fresh and from scratch, and made with lots of love.  We want to come back and brings lots of friends to enjoy the easy going atmosphere.",

I feel like they should have named it Millennial in a Quarter Life Crisis Diner because this restaurant is having an identity crisis. It seems like the interior decor was designed by a 55 year old who looked at a Buzzfeed list of things millennials like and then just crammed all of them into the building without taking into account that they don't all go together. In the diner there is old milk cartons turned into seats, disco balls, pinatas, plants in hanging macrame holders, and your receipt comes in an old book. And yes while all those things can be neat when used well, that is not the case here. Additionally, I feel the food quality has gone down. The portions seemed smaller and the quality of the meat just wasn't there. Previously, you could taste the high quality meat in the burger. Not anymore. The patio was fine. However, the lightning could be improved. It was too harsh. All in all this now feels like a restaurant you would find in Downtown Gilbert.",

The brisket on the fries was really good and tender but I didn't care for their slaw.  Yelp mentions it is a good place for kids and maybe it is during the day. We are traveling and are way off our routine. We came around 10 at night with a 4 year old. Don't do that lol. (Don't judge , she was fine, just off a 3 hour \"nap\" with her daddy who is recovering from night shift Army stuff). Anyway, the crowd is young and language was vulgar from multiple tables.

This place is right in the middle of a downtown Phoenix residential neighborhood and it doesn't look like much from the outside. There are several communal tables outside as well as 8 or 9 stools in a very small area inside. We found a spot at one of the tables and started chatting with our table mates.  The menu is small but has lots of foodie offerings. Our group had: the PB&B, the fried green tomato sandwich, biscuits and gravy and poutine. Everything was fantastic, although the poutine is untraditional. The gravy on my biscuits and gravy had some of the best, yummy, flavorful, salty gravy I've had. And the biscuit was cut in half and grilled so it was a bit crispy. The tap beer list is also pretty impressive considering the building is pretty much a trailer!   It was a great atmosphere with legit eats!",

A nice establishment with outdoor and indoor seating. It was somewhat busy as we waited approx. 10 min to be seated (but we wanted to be indoors) plenty of seating outdoors.  The menu has a nice variety of vegetarian offerings, which was a plus for one of our friends. We ordered: 1. Jackfruit/Pulled Pork Fries: (the description: \"carolina bbq, slaw\")  A very generous serving of jackfruit atop french fries, with too much pickled cabbage (not traditional slaw). It should be noted that this dish is quite spicy, for those that don't know Carolina BBQ, it's a mustard based sauce. I wasn't a fan of the slaw at all, there was just too much. 2. Jackfruit Po'boy: (description: Kiltlifter braised jackfruit, carolina bbq, slaw on a soft Noble baguette) The friend that ordered this is a vegetarian and was excited for this sandwich. Unfortunately, as previously mentioned, the sauce was far too spicy for her, she ended up trading her meal with her partner and got the...  3. Fried Green Tomato: (the description: corn relish, chipotle ranch, arugula on sour dough) another generous serving, however, the sandwich was too dry so a side of dressing was ordered to help that. Plenty of food though, half of the sandwich was taken home for lunch the next day! 4. Grilled cheese (the description: cheddar, muenster, smoked gouda, smoked Roma tomatoes, on sourdough. They found this sandwich tasty and satisfying. A few people order alcoholic drinks and were happy with what they ordered.  Pros- Generous servings, delicious fries, roasted brussel sprouts are good too   Cons- smaller establishment, you may have a wait",

Definitely not what I expected when looking from the outside in, but the amazing food and menu options make all your doubts go away for sure. I had the KoKo biscuit and that was very good. The chipotle sauce is what makes it. When seeing \"biscuit\" I was unsure if it was going to enough to fill me but when it came out it was a big enough biscuit to fill you up! The entrees are greatly portioned. My mom ordered Jambalaya which she loved saying it was a \"blast of flavors\" and different from what she's had before. She and I also shared the delicious French fries (great size to share!). And to top it all off the beignets were literally fresh out the fryer! Overall amazing place! Wanna go back!",

My friend and I shared a Hot Toddy and, by recommendation from the gentleman in the window, mac n cheese with chorizo. I would've gone with fried chicken but he said chorizo was his preference. It was delicious. The Toddy and macaroni was perfect comfort food on a cold night. This is only one experience. I've brought everyone from friends, dates, and clients to my mom, brother and sisters all separately. Let's just say I love this place and I love introducing new people to it. Most people go for the Big Jim fried chicken sandwich and I won't wrong them for it but you have to try their Po Boy, poutines, burgers and jackfruit dishes. You get lucky if you can find room at the counter but the patio is very comfortable and the service outside is exceptional and with a smile. Tell your friends!",

Great place to check out though when weather is nice as it appeared almost all of the seating was outside.  We split the mac and cheese and a fried chicken sandwich with honey.  Both were great.  I am generally not a huge fan of fried chicken but theirs is legit.  Not to greasy and lots of flavor.  Great biscuit as well.  Also thought the mac and cheese was some of the best mac and cheese we have ever had.  Comparable to what you would get at a fine dining restaurant.  Definitely will be back--want to try some of there other things and drinks next time.  Very hipster feel.",

Welcome Diner - great concept, great execution and great food!  It took me awhile to figure out its location - I drove by it a few times before I realized - oh that's the restaurant and found a parking spot behind the restaurant.  You walk up to the to a window/counter and order from the posted menu and then grab a seat outside in the front yard/deck/patio area.  Had the vegetarian option (vegan po'boy) along with some biscuits and a tea. Great tasting food.    Loved sitting outside (it was around 800p or so) - a big table full of folks across the patio so I just relaxed at one of the counter/stool seats along the sidewalk - nice to just relax and catchup on emails/news/etc.   Crazy but I guess I never noticed that an inside for dining room also - I just assumed it was outdoor dining only.    Customers were walking, biking, and driving to get to the restaurant - which can make a restaurant an interesting people watching experience!   Highly recommended.",

We ate at Payton Curry's pop-up restaurant at the Welcome Diner last night, April 19, 2011, and the following is what we ate, but you may have a different menu on Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday evenings from 5pm-close through July 4.  Chef, I hear, tries to keep it real and keep it local and fresh when sourcing his menu, so it changes each week.  McClendon's Select was mentioned more than once.  (PRICE NOTE:  On Tuesdays from 10pm-close, the menu is 1/2 price to be sure Curry exhausts his fresh produce and meats.)  Welcome Diner was serving about 12 people when we arrived, 6 at the inside counter and three couples outside dotting the front yard, set up with a picnic table, a sawhorse, some two tops, and glass tabletop lanterns.  The food came out quickly, and our gracious and knowledgeable server asked if we'd like our dishes as they were prepared or in courses. We opted for the former.  My darling dining partner and I shared all four dishes.  THOSE DAMN GREEN BEANS We started with green beans, as crisp as they were picked, with just one tip snapped off, just like my grandmother taught me.  These were served with a citrus creme fraiche and some recently picked tarragon.  I always love dairy with tarragon, and this dish, served cool (not cold) if I remember, was dusted with local bee pollen, granular bits that taste of honey and something else and melt on your tongue.  MOZZARELLA The menu insists there's basil in this tangential rendition of caprese -- and there probably is -- but the takeaway message from this panko-encrusted slab of mozzarella with the sweetest tomatoes I've eaten is a sweet-n-sour burst with every olive oily bite.  A standout appetizer.  GNOCCHI If you're like me, when you've eaten or prepared gnocchi before, you assume they get plopped into the boiling salted water before the plump up and rise to the surface.  Not so fast, Barilla Boy.  Payton Curry's gnocchi, I believe, are (dry?) pan-seared on both sides,   keeping all the doughy, gummy deliciousness often lost in the water.  The madeira wine and cream reduction here smothers the pillowy gnocchi and tooth-tender walnuts and squiggly good morel mushrooms in a way that makes you close your eyes, shut off your hearing, and attempt to pour all of your sensory energy into taste and smell.  When eating this dish, I more than once covered my face with my hand to shield what may have been unflattering facial pangs of ecstasy.    LEMON CURD We struggled to choose this dessert over the Strawberry Olive Oil Cake and Strawberry Malt, but we got our strawberry fix as the second layer in this delectable parfait, topped with the airiest foamy meringue, and served in a mason jar.  The macerated strawberries made you want to relive childhood and replace mom's jelly with Payton's strawberries to accompany Laura Scudder in your PB&J sandwich.  We clanged spoons at the bottom of the jar for the last bit of bee pollen.  $62 with tax and tip.  We didn't bring a BYOB wine but would next time.  (The $13 corkage fee seems high, but there ought to be an explanation for that.)  Everyone working in the tiny dinette and serving the tables outside had huge smiles and loads of enthusiasm for what they were contributing to the Garfield neighborhood and to the downtown culinary scene.  Others are taking notice, too. Michelle Laudig (former restaurant critic at Phoenix New Times) and Aaron Chamberlin of St. Francis both dropped in during our dinner.  I worry about the AZ heat baking the charm out of patio dining in May,  June, and July for Chef Curry, but I hope to return in April...maybe on a Tuesday at 10pm for half-price eats.

The place is super cute (tiny inside and a nice patio), awesome, unique menu, EXTREMELY friendly service and the food was killer. I chose the Bumble Bee, fried chicken breast, local honey, house made beer mustard and bread &  butter pickles on a huge homemade biscuit. How they got the chicken freakishly crunchy yet completely juicy on the inside is a mystery right up there with the Loch Ness Monster and Bermuda Triangle. For a side, I tried the fried avocado. Oh yes, I said it. Again, crispy beyond belief and soft creamy avocado on the inside. There may be voodoo happening in that tiny kitchen. I will be back to investigate further...maybe for brunch!",

Tiny enough that you HAVE to talk to the staff, they're right next to you.  Unless you sit outside.  That might be fun, too.  I've never actually been to a diner that had a liquor license, so have a hurricane with your brunch.",

(I've posted a picture)  **** note they don't take credit/debit cards ****  The neighborhood isn't the greatest but no biggie.  I have to say best part was the service!  After ordering and telling them I'd eat outside they asked if I had a dog, I said yes, and he said \"I'll get you a bowl of water before anything else.\"  SOOOOOO cool!  They CLEARLY take GREAT care an food prep ... they wear latex gloves and unlike other like places .... when dealing with the money part they take off the gloves!  Highly recommended!!!",

It took a couple of minutes to discover that when on the patio you make your initial order from a window. Absolutely easy. Lots of yummy looking choices on the menu, I was torn between having the \"Bumble Bee\" chicken sandwich and the \"Chorizo Meatloaf\" - the guy taking my order suggested the Chorizo and it was fantastic! Well-prepared and just a little spicy, I'll do it again sometime but first I want to check out more of the menu. By the way they have a full bar, wine, and local craft beers too. Almost forgot we missed on the special dessert that night (all gone already) but shared a really yummy lemon-blueberry pie!",

I had seen a picture on IG and the food looks delicious plus I love supporting local businesses, so i was excited to try it.  I went inside and there was 1 table available so I asked the girl cleaning the table If I can seat myself or if they seat the guests, she asked if it was just me & I let her know I was meeting someone.  She said she couldn't give me a table until the whole party was there so I'd have to wait outside -- TOTALLY understandable. No problem with not being able to give me a table. So I said, \"oh okay. Is it okay if I wait here?\" -- I was standing by the door/server station.  She replied, \"sorry, you're going to have to wait outside\"   Ummmm okay....? It was 104 outside. Sooo I went outside and saw my friend across the street & decided to just eat at Cafe Gallo instead since I really didn't like that interaction at all. I don't have anything to say about the food because the service was horrible.",

Then it's smothered with gravy that's oh so good. I also recommend getting some French fries, Mac and cheese and maybe even a drink. Great thing also about this place is that it opens late! So for those to come out of LUXX and want to turn down, this place is a less than a mile away.",

The side of fries was delicious as well....crispy/hot. This place has literally the best burgers in the Phoenix metro area!  If you are here in Phoenix and you eat meat this is the place to get your burger!!!!  If you do not eat meat, this is the place to get your fried green tomatoes sandwich!   this place!    Sent the husband and my daughter to the new digs for some takeout. Old location was definitely an eat there kind of place. The new location is too!  My dinner was yummy, but my family came home with stories of employees that were a little rude or stressed????  I have alway experienced kindness and respect at the old location. So...I am not sure what happened tonight. Plus, the menu has changed a little. Where is the peanut butter burger???  I love you Welcome Diner. Please get it together!!!  I NEED you to be as good or better than the old location!!!!",

There was a big line outside for window orders to eat outside or take away.  It's nestled in a historic neighborhood between houses and a little community center, and across from another great restaurant and some shops!

    "text": "Let me cut to the chase: the flavors here are absolutely superb. If you're looking for robust and full-bodied comforting flavors with original pairings at a budget-friendly rate: this is a fantastic choice. I'm in love with this location and their menu and I've barely made a ding in their menu! As an undying sweets foodie, I tried two of their desserts first: the tepary bean spiced custard pie with cornmeal crust and a hibiscus whip, and a salted bourbon caramel chocolate chip pecan pie slice.   ...there's a reason why I don't have photos. I went in for a sample and couldn't stop! I ate both slices in the time it takes to breathe two breaths and they were stunningly good!! The salted caramel chocolate chip pecan pie was really the standout if you like thick, decadent, heavy flavors (so for many, consider sharing with a loved one!) The tepary bean spiced custard pie reminded me a lot of a version of pumpkin pie with both texture and flavor...which has everything to do with the \"spiced\" component of the pie. There was also included a hibiscus whip which actually separated and added a sweet essence that enhanced the flavor and separated the textures of the slice. Definitely something unique and try-worthy, but maybe not a repeat buy (it isn't for me).  Cons: parking is difficult and all street oriented, and the hours...this is definitely not a location good for pick-up around end-of-work day, it's a commitment to an evening at the restaurant type of place. Heads up of menu changes: sometimes they are last minute (via Instagram posting) and shortly lived (don't always plan on offerings being available multiple days in a row)...for someone driving from Peoria, I appreciate a greater heads up so I can adjust my schedule to drive down for the exciting eats...  Will I be back? Very likely and next time I'm hoping to dig into some savory plates! (Pb&j burger, I got my eye on you!)",

That would be the price of eating Cajun inspired food all the time.  The Diner is a really fun space with lots of outside seating. Dinner this time for us started, as usual, with the Pork French Fries. Yea, it's what you think it is - BBQ pulled pork over fries topped with purple cabbage slaw. As we told Brendan, who was our waiter: the fries are pure evil. My husband had the No Way Jose hamburger which was perfectly cooked and very juicy and delicious. I had the special - a fried shrimp po-boy. Huge shrimp with a very crispy coating. Spicy aioli, baby greens and tomatoes. Incredible. Oh and the have great cocktails and home made ginger beer. We took a piece of their pecan, chocolate and salted caramel pie home. It was unbelievably good, and an incredibly good mix of flavors. And if Brandon reads this, while the pecan pie is pretty spectacular, my grandmother's recipe is still the best. If they made She Crab Soup, the Welcome Diner would be irresistible.",

    "text": "I saw the original location featured on Check Please Arizona...fast forward to now, myself and a group of friends were in the neighborhood and wanted to give it a try. We seated ourselves outside on the patio while reviewing the menu. Once we all decided what to order, we got up and stood in line at the window. I didn't expect this process to take so long, being as though there were only 2 couples ahead of us. 40 minutes later we were able to place our order(I'm assuming they were extremely short staffed). The drinks came extremely quick and were delicious. Next up was the food...the server handed me my plate, and my fingers were immediately stuck to the plate and now covered in some sticky residue(assuming syrup), which is the funny part because none of the 5 plates at our table included that. After a couple more minutes the rest of the plates were delivered to the table, during which time I noticed that the entire rim of my plate was covered in some type of fibers. As of the plate was dirty, and someone wiped it off with a napkin and quickly plated my food. D I S G U S T I N G. My biscuits were burnt to hell, there was a hair under a piece of watermelon on my plate, and I've tasted beige paint chips that have more flavor than the gravy. Another person from our group, also found a hair under the side of bread they ordered at the bottom of the bowl. This place was dirty, nasty gross and I would never go back again. Dine at your own risk!",

Modern meets the past in this old school diner setting with an infusion of handcrafted mixed drinks using unusual ingredients (Creosote, anyone?) and delicious food. My friend and I grabbed two appetizers, including pulled pork french fries (they had a Jackfruit fries option!) and Octopus Masa Balls. Wow! They were kind of like hush puppies, and we giggled a lot about the name. I forget the name of my drink but it was like a ice smoothie with absinthe in it and was so yummy. I had a Big Jim burger on a biscuit smothered in gravy with cheese for $11. Huge! And different, and tasty! I'd love to come back and see how they progress and if the menu changes over time, which the waitress said it probably would.",

Ordered the Welcome Burger, medium well, raw onions, no pickles (because they were bread and butter pickles and I don't like those). It came with a choice of side and I picked fries.   The burger was FAN. FRIGGIN. TASTIC. I can say the same for the fries. My wife tried both and agreed with my enthusiasm. In fact, I can say without exaggeration that this was easily one of the top 5 burgers I've ever had in my 30 years of life. Can't speak highly enough of the burger and also the fries. We'll definitely be coming back here on our way to the airport before leaving Arizona.",

    "text": "So glad I found this place! My friend and I walked over on First Friday after a guy recommended it to us and described it as a place with great \"comfort food.\" It's a few blocks from the more populated, business portion of Roosevelt. Since we were walking at night, it was a little sketchy given it was dark and there were barely any street lights. But the food and service were well worth the 5 minute creepy walk. Plus it made it more of an adventure ;)  This places feels like an outdoor diner, located on a residential block. You order your food at a window and then find a seat outside in the cute little lot. Despite the fact it was First Friday, the wait wasn't long at all. I think this is because, as I mentioned, it's a bit off the main strip of Roosevelt. We were able to easily find a comfortable place to sit and the service was great. I loved how patient the woman taking our order was and her enthusiasm describing their menu :) There's nothing worse than when you're excited to try a new place and the service is lackluster. This woman took her time and even checked on us later once our food arrived.  I tried the crunchy peanut butter, bacon burger with pickles and cheddar cheese. I know, right?! Sounds crazy! It was highly recommended by the person in front of me in line. And just way too weird for me to not try ---and man, am I glad I did! It was SO GOOD! The flavors actually really complimented each other, especially the saltiness of the peanut butter/bacon and sweetness of the peanut butter/pickles. The bun was also fantastic and fresh. Descent beef portion too. It came with a side of fries which were cooked to perfection.   I will definitely be returning. There are a bunch of other delicious sounding items I'd like to try. A place with a cool, hipster vibe to it and the food, service, and unique menu are outstanding!!",

Overpriced, overworked menu ideas are from newbe Chefs, I pray you get over it and think good food for everyone. I had the fried green tomato sandwich which underwhelmed with mushy tomato which the corn relish could not help. Hard to believe $8 for a side of Mac & Cheese but I ordered it. It wasn't the worst I have endured but far from acceptable, no flavor and texture was again, mush. Don't know where all these great Yelp reviews come from but I am losing faith in Yelp.",

You feel like you're part of a real community when you sit outside (even in the 100+ degree weather) sipping on a great cocktail amongst old houses and the typical noises of a neighborhood.  The food is a perfect harmony of fresh culinary vision and traditional greasy spoon deliciousness.  So, get here soon; I am sure you'll feel welcomed too.",

The ingredients are clearly top notch fir the Phoenix scene, there just needs to be a bit more focus on proper seasoning and developing more flavor from these ingredients. The pork and grits looked great on the plate but once it was on my mouth it just lacked flavor. A bit of salt would have helped, using some Chile and some type of vinegar to add some acidity also would have helped. Fried chicken was cooked to perfection but the fry batter needs to be seasoned and it then be great chicken. So the potential is there to be great, unfortunately right now it's just ok to good.",

From downtown we took a short lightrail ride (because he doesn't like to walk recreationally) then ironically still had to walk for what appeared to be forever through the sketchy part of town -- no we didn't take the art district route.  The diner literally is a mobile kitchen. Bigger than a food truck, I mean enough to situate a counter, a line of barstools and the cooking area. The guys on board are super friendly, accommodating and truly love the contribution they've made to the community.  Yes this little kitchen serves cocktails and beer.  We ordered the acclaimed big Jim, two of them, hash browns and beignets.   Our big Jims were delicious. Extremely hearty with extra gravy. Unfortunately, however, without the gravy, the biscuit would be just thirst inducingly dry.  I suppose that would be one way to get you to drink more!    Again loved the gravy. They even gave me a ramikin of their mushroom gravy cause they felt I had to try it..also quite delicious.   The hash browns and beignets were alright but didn't contribute to this diner's stars.  We were impressed with our main entrees and by the guys who run this little miracle on wheels.",

Came here after the Suns v Warriors game and had ourselves the poutine fries, Mac and cheese with chorizo and I got the Big Jim and my gf got the Bumblebee. The poutine fries were decent. We both loved the Mac and cheese with chorizo! You can usually add any toppings you want to the Mac and cheese. My gf didn't like her bumblebee. She said there was too much seeded mustard and too much honey. But she did say the chicken was moist and tender. My big Jim was pretty good although I wish it had more gravy. Gravy was delicious, chicken was tender but overall I felt it was a little too \"dry\". But then again I like sauces with my food and in this case if I'm getting gravy, the more the better. Some might disagree and say too much takes away from the flavor of other ingredients. True. But IMO I wish it had more gravy. Without it, the biscuit was good but a little dry. Overall, food, service and ambience was good. Cool, hip place. Would definitely come back for Mac and cheese and maybe try a different biscuit \"sandwich\"",

    "text": "My 16 year-old son and I were already downtown and starving, so we decided to give WD a try. It was only 4:30 on a Friday, and they don't open until 5 pm, so we just cruised around the neighborhood for a little while to kill time. We walked up right as they opened (in fact, we were the first people there, other than a young lady ordering take out from the window). I wasn't sure how it all worked, not having been before, and didn't know that there is indoor seating, so we were prepared to sit at one of the tables out front. The cheery guy sticking his head out of the take-out window invited us in, to our relief (It was kind of chilly outside). We took the bar stools at the farthest end from the door. But with the music speaker directly behind our heads and in the path of a vigorously blowing fan, we weren't in the most comfortable spot. But before we could decide whether or not to move (I mean a couple of minutes!), every seat was taken and a long line of people was queuing up out front at the take-out window. So we stayed put and waited to order.  As I noted, we were the first people to arrive, so I was a tad annoyed that it took so long to place my drink order (two other customers' orders were  taken before mine, so I also had a bit of a wait for my Manhattan, which was delicious; still, the bartender needs to work on his speed of execution--I tended bar for several years, and besides not paying attention to taking orders in order of the customers' arrival, he was slow and a bit fumbly).  While we were sitting there waiting to order food, Mr. Cheerful came over to show us diners the evening's special: chicken and sausage gumbo. He explained that it had a southwest twist--nopalitas instead of okra, which makes sense, because getting fresh okra right now is not an option (which is why gumbo made in the winter traditionally includes file powder--or if it's a seafood gumbo, roux. Nowadays, though, you're likely to find any combination of okra, file, and/or roux. I was told that WD's gumbo just used a roux.). The little squares of nopalitas added a delicious flavor and texture, and if you didn't tell someone otherwise, they'd never guess they were eating cactus paddles.  Anyway, I was intrigued. I grew up in the South and have spent a fair amount of time in Louisiana, so I consider myself well-versed on this dish that I often make myself--although during this season of Lent, one is more apt to find gumbo z'erbes on home tables than the version with meat). Plus, I was freezing because of the fan, so a steaming bowl of gumbo sounded perfect.  And it was, although I had to ask for a spoon so I could eat it.  A  couple of dashes of  hot sauce,  and it was so, so good. I could've easily eaten a second serving! Speaking of seconds, my son loved his Little Birdy biscuit sandwich so much that when he finished it, he asked if he could have another. Hah! Well, it was that good. The biscuit is tender and crumbly (and huge), and we are a biscuit-crazy family, but the chicken was the real star. Seriously addictive stuff. We also ordered a bowl of the mac 'n cheese, which was a very generous portion of pasta drenched in a sauce containing a hint of smokiness (from smoked Gouda, I suspect). I found it a bit flat (underseasoned) and disappointing. The \"herbs\" seemed to amount to a sad sprinkling of chives that did nothing except add a dash of color, and the cheese sauce tasted more of bechamel than cheese. As my son commented, \"This can't hold a candle to your friend Bernie's mac and cheese at Citizen.\" Agreed. One more note about the dish: while it's definitely fun to watch someone in the tiny kitchen whip out a blow torch and pass it over a dish, it doesn't really add anything to this one (at least not ours). The result was a scattering of blackened spots across the top, rather than creating a bubbly, browned top. If there'd been a sprinkling of cheese to torch, then I'd see the point. But as it is? Nope.  We wound up taking most of it home, and I'll doctor the leftovers up myself. After we stuffed ourselves on dinner, my son unbelievably still had room for dessert. Of course, we ordered beignets. Ok, bear with this picky foodie for a second: these fried donuts served in a pool of really, really good honey and powdered sugar were delicious. But beignets? They looked like beignets. They smelled like beignets. But these little fried gems are dense rather than the slightly chewy, airy pillows I expected. I don't think they used a choux pastry or let it rise long enough.  In any case, don't expect real beignets and you'll happily enjoy them!  We look forward to returning to WD, although we plan to hit their sister joint Welcome CHICKEN + DONUTS first. I'll post something here when we do.",

    "text": "First time at Welcome Diner. Really good looking menu but the execution really failed.   I arrived at 7:30 on a Friday night with my daughter and her husband. We were 15th in line yet didn't get a table for an hour. With one window taking all of the orders, it was painfully slow.   Our food didn't arrive for another 40 minutes. Yes, an hour and forty total. Brutal. I ordered a burger with poutine fries as a side, along with water. My daughter got the fried green tomato sandwich and water while her husband got the jambalaya and a coke.  After ordering you have to 'fight' for a table, which are few. We sat with two other couples at the family style seating.   My burger was good but the fries were awful. I'd never had poutine before but it was cold. I grabbed my first fry and got a mass of 15 fries welded together. Poorly done. The fried green tomato sandwich was another fail, as the toast was thick, hard and cold. She ended up eating it open faced. The jambalaya was okay.   Service was non-existent so we were ignored.   I may try Welcome Diner again, based on the clever menu but I am hesitant.",

Don't guzzle your drink too quickly,  it takes a while to get your food after you order.  It's well worth the wait though, and the people watching & music make the time go by faster.  We will return!  Now we're craving that fried chicken and gravy even more.  We will get there earlier on future visits.  Btw open till 2am with full bar.

Also recommend the mac n' cheese as a side to share with your friends, it's a large tasty portion. There's a bartender inside that makes great a great old fashioned. The seating is first come first server and there's no table service (unless you sit inside at the bar which seats about 8 people). Have one person wait in line to place your order an another hold down some spots during busy hours.",

It took a while (45 min) to get the food, but I was understanding considering how small their kitchen and cooktop were.. And how busy they were (always a good sign). We also ordered a dessert at the same time we ordered dinner, and FORTY minutes AFTER we finished our dinner (a total of an hour and a half of waiting), still nothing. I pulled our waiter aside and asked him about them, he nicely said, \" they're the next order up.\" Ok.. I was Pissed off, but I let it go. Another 15 minutes goes by, 4 OTHER orders to different tables that got there an hour after we did... NOTHING. Got up and left. He watched us leave and said nothing. A lot of distractions happening, and with the prices they have, they need to deliver not only with taste (which I will say, they did) but with service also. Just because you serve good food does not mean you can make people wait for over an hour and a half for it. Not that worth it.",

The handcrafted libations are all done very well and they are not shy with their pours!  It comes as no surprise to me that this business is thriving and growing!  All day happy hour on Tuesdays.

Someone would mention it and, mentally, I'd make a note to make it over there but that swiftly slipped my mind. Until recently, when my buddy Paul wanted to get out for dinner. And enter Welcome Diner.  The weather was great for our meal, maybe a little chilly. Paul ordered the fish po'boy and a side of poutine (the latter we shared), I ordered the Garfield (which was previously on the menu, then taken off, because it was announced on the board as such) with an over-easy egg. The spicy fried kale was fantastic. However, eating this as a sandwich was messy--I had yolk and juices dripping which resulted in me licking my hands and arms like the dog in the corner. There was a dog in the corner; we were on the patio. So, I took the top biscuit off and finished it with a fork and knife.   Paul said he enjoyed the po'boy, but we both agreed what they called poutine wasn't poutine. It was fries with shredded cheese melted over it and white gravy. Not bad, really, but not the poutine we've had.  So now that I've *finally* made it here, I know now I'll be back again and again. Thx, Paul!",

It's been so long since anyone in a restaurant has treated me like a person, given honest recommendations and put time and effort into their craft.    3) The food is decadent in moderation, creative without being threatening and amazing in my mouth.    The only disclaimer I have is that you need to remember that good things come to those who wait, this place gets really busy and has a tiny prep area and bar but they make it work with grace and expertise. Just enjoy the scenery and your patience will pay off .",

    "text": "I'd like to preface with the fact that we came here after First Friday. My partner and I had just finished vending and were looking for a way to celebrate the end of the night. We're old birds that don't stay up very late, so late night dining is fairly foreign to us, especially in Phoenix. We yelped and found Welcome Diner. Our company was delighted that I had mentioned it as she had been here previously. An antsy me took that as a good sign and didn't even think about needing to wait in line.   When we first walked up to the diner, we noticed a huge amount of people sitting outside, a very long line, and a few groups standing around. My partner and I joined the groups of people standing around trying to look for somewhere else to go. We really didn't feel like waiting in line. We couldn't get ahold of our company to switch gears, so we ended up just standing in line. When they arrived, we were reassured that the wait would be worth it. We waited 56 minutes in line... FIFTY SIX MINUTES. There had to be approximately ~13 people in front of us. When we finally got to the front of the line, we had to wait another 10 before the guy that was just sitting there took out order. The kitchen looked really busy, but definitely the long line was a little more than they can handle it seemed. I'm not one to wait too long for food, so this was just a miserable experience for me. I promise I'll move on from the wait times soon...but we literally waited another 48 minutes for out food to come out.   Moving on...  Pulled Jackfruit Po'Boy - 3.5/5 - Jackfruit was WAY too saucy and salty. Just a reminder to everyone and anyone that makes pulled jackfruit with BBQ...a little bit of BBQ goes a long way. You don't need to drench it. This made the \"toasted\" much too soggy for my liking. I was told that this would be the best pulled jackfruit I'd ever had... and I believed it because of the line, but I was sorta disappointed.   Mac & Cheese - 5/5 - okay, this was really damn delicious, enough said.  Jackfruit Fries - 4/5 I think I would've preferred this as my choice dish over the Po'boy. The fries just went better than the baguette   All in all- I really hated that I had to wait so long for this meal. If I had not been with good company and company that I had not seen for ages...I wouldn't have waited. I wasn't amazed with the food, but I'd give it another try, so long as I did not have to wait two hours.",

Something happened to the food quality, the charm and most of all the service.  I am giving an overall 3 star review in hopes of change. However food right now would get about a 2, service (including host stand would get a 2 as well. Without those two main things it's hard to feel the charm.  Please do something about your biscuits, once lovely, they are now dense & salty.  Table side service is decent, hosts are down right rude.  Just remember, I still want to love it, but it's just as easy to dine across the street at Gallo Blanco.  I don't think I'm alone here in my thinking.  Cheers and good day",

Last Friday night we got lucky and got a seat inside - yay! After enjoying the food from Welcome Chicken and Donuts on Broadway oh so much, I knew Welcome Diner wasn't going to disappoint. Our server, Taylor, was so enthusiastic and knowledgeable about every dish and all of its ingredients - it's such a joy to see someone take pride in their work and I haven't even gotten to the food yet. We started off with the roasted brussell sprouts - yummy charred goodness plus it was a vegetable which buffered the other stuff I'm about to mention .... We both got chicken and biscuit masterpieces - The Bumblebee for me with its delicious pickles and honey mustard - all scratch made. My husband got the Big Jim - all I can say is \"wow\" - everything you could ever want in your life from the chicken, the bacon, the biscuit and the gravy. Oh, and did I mention their gorgeous, craft cocktails? They have those too. Now on to dessert - chocolate chunk. pecan. sea salt. pie - and believe me you get gorgeous chunks of everything in every bite! Their coffee is pretty darn fantastic too - from Piexoto in Chandler.  All in all, a damn perfect experience.",

I absolutely adore the outdoor seating, especially during the cooler months in Arizona, with the gorgeous overhead lights. The service is always excellent; everyone that works here genuinely looks like they enjoy their job. Brace yourselves for long lines, and a long wait for your food. Don't worry, the food is worth the wait!   My favorite items on the menu are Bumblebee and Koko. I love the taste of salty and sweet together; if you are the same way then you would certainly enjoy Bumblebee. The delicious crispy chicken pairs well with the honey. I am not usually a fan of biscuits but they do it so well at Welcome Diner. Koko is also my favorite. This is what I order when I prefer something less tasty but equally as good as Bumblebee. I always pair my sandwiches with their delicious french fries, paired with their (garlic?) sauce. My boyfriend always get their burger (No Way Jose) and he loves it. Welcome Diner is not just perfect for brunch or dinner. It is the perfect place to just hang out and have a drink with friends.",

Just the quality of the beef was so tasty. Even the pain fries were notably delicious. Portions are good, they serve the full menu until closing, and like... How can plain fries be so delicious??   Husband unit and I had Mac and cheese (plain, but still amazing). He had the welcome burger, I had a koko chicken and biscuit (good, but his burger was better), plain fries, coleslaw (vinegar based), and bignets. All. Amazing. So amazing that we're coming back here before we fly home, which is saying something because we typically like to try everying new on vacation.   There's 90% outdoor seating. It's definitely chill. Service is really friendly and casual... Like you're at an outdoor bbq kind of. Cokes are by the bottle, and there's fileted water self-serve from a cooler.   Working on crunchy, sweet, hot bignets right now... Must stop reviewing before husband eats them all.   COME HERE NOW.",

    "text": "I tried Welcome Diner after a co-worker recommended it. It's definitely one of my favorite spots to go to now if it's cool out at night or if I'm in the downtown area.  FOOD: I had the Big Jim Fried Chicken Biscuit Sandwich which was heavenly perfect comfort food. Biscuit was perfect and so was everything really. The side of watermelon is unique yet complimenting to most of their dishes. My friend got a side of fries and one of the burgers. I helped destroy the fries, they are seasoned and fantastic, especially with their special dipping sauce! On a second occasion, I tried a Coconut beer they had which sounded weird, but they give tasters and it was actually really good.  SERVER: No server really. Just go up to the window after reviewing the menu and order. They've always been friendly when I've asked questions and after you seat, someone will bring your food and condiments as needed. Pick your beer up at the window, though, the server can't do refills apparently.  HOSTING: No hosting, just sit yourself down outside where most of the seating is at, under the night sky. There is space inside but it's very tiny -- maybe 6-8 people max.  AMBIANCE: Outdoor seating mostly that's fenced off with patio / outdoor style tables. It fits perfectly with the trailer-diner vibe. Also, the string lights above are perfect. Excellent for chilling with friends or for a casual romantic date.  PARKING: I usually park on the East side across the street; There's a Water Mill station with some parking and late at night, that seems to be where other people park as well. Otherwise, down one of the side streets works too.  Albeit a bit of a hipster crowd every time I've gone (to be expected in the Downtown Phoenix area), it's still a pretty awesome neighborhood spot. Love the overall vibe of the place. Reminds me a lot of what they have in New York City -- a small place on the corner amongst a residential area.   Best to come here when it's cooler out at night! I'm only giving 4 stars because it's primarily outdoor seating, which poses a problem if it unexpectedly rains or if it's summertime because even at night, anywhere from May-September it's still 100+ degrees out and can ruin a date night. Otherwise, this is highly recommended as a unique restaurant in Phoenix.",

The food is more on the gourmet side, they have a nice selection of alcoholic drinks. Not much room inside the diner but plenty of room outside. They have heat lamps if its that time of year. Service was very friendly and the person who took our order was very informative and was talking about where they get their bacon from AMAT ngst other details.  I ordered the PoBoy fish sandwich and friend got the Big Jim chicken biscuit. No sides came with our food except some watermelon. I didnt taste the big jim but looked good and my friend said it was great. PoBoy was very good and whatever sauce they use in it was outstanding   I would def come back again for the price i wish they included some kind if side besides the watermelon but overall excellent experience and food. Check it out",

I responded that many people are allergic to gluten and that it is sold in all grocery stories at the same price as regular bread, the response was shockingly, \"we choose not to carry it.\"   If I was alone, I would have left, however since I was with someone I did not.    At some point they will be more accommodating to a growing segment of the population but until they do, if you have a gluten allergy or celiac avoid the Welcome Diner.",

    "text": "When my wife suggested going to a diner for dinner, my mind immediately went to comfort food. You know, those culinary staples that we all need in good times and bad. Needless to say, I was looking forward to it.  When we arrived at Welcome Diner, my first observation was the location. A somewhat rundown neighborhood undergoing changes of gentrification. The diner itself sits on the corner directly across from what looked like an old market that had been turned into a cafe/bar. Overall, a very intriguing location within a very positive and vibrant community.   You don't order your food at Welcome Diner like you would at your normal greasy spoon. There isn't the smell of fried potatoes and stale coffee or a waitress with big Texas hair brining you biscuits and gravy. You actually order your food from a small window in front of the diner. Once you order, you can sit inside if there is room or sit outside. The weather last night was really nice. Not hell hot, so we sat outside. FYI, finding seating outside can be a little hairy. There are several tables and some counter type seating, but all of the outside seating is first come, first serve.  The menu is simple, but take comfort food to a whole new level. To give you an example, when I think about a diner, I think about meatloaf. So I ordered Welcome's version. A Chorizo Meatloaf covered in a Chipotle and white wine cream sauce, picked vegetables, and Brahbant potatoes. Very innovative in my book. When you cut into the meatloaf you get an incredible burst of flavor with the sauce and pickled veg. The potatoes added the salty flavor to the sweetness of the pickled veg. My wife ordered the Koko, which was a sandwich consisting of a pieces fried chicken, covered in Chipotle ranch dressing topped with tomato and arugula. Then all of the aforementioned is stuff between a sliced biscuit. I only sampled the chicken, but it was full of flavor an tender. My daughter ordered the bacon Mac N' Cheese. She at a little more than half of it, which told me it was off the charts. I tried it and loved it. The bacon in the Mac N' Cheese wasn't just your average, tiny bacon bits. It was actual small pieces of bacon. As a side, we ordered the roasted Brussels sprouts. they weren't roasted as much as I do them at home, but they were still good. I also ordered a Manhattan off of their cocktail menu.  No complaints on the service or wait staff. Everyone we interacted with was very friendly. Especially the gentleman who took our order at the window. He wasn't rushing people and chatting with them a bit. Basically, making you feel.....Welcome. Parking was easy for us to find. In fact, we got a spot right in front of the diner itself. I noticed a lot of people were Ubering to the diner as well.  If I'm ever in the Phoenix area again, I'm definitely going back to the Welcome Diner.",

Seen all their great pics and thought we would give it a shot this morning..wished I had passed  The Good The breakfast burger is by far the best I've ever had. Cooked perfectly, bacon jam..do I need to say more?! Mexican Coke yes please! The Bad The servers just think they are too cool for school. Little annoying. Also really...you don't open until 10am?! Must be because the servers are too cool to be open before then  The Ugly When my hubs orders the bumble bee and it's literally chicken and a biscuit it better be f'n fantastic and unfortunately it missed the mark big time in the biscuit department. It was so dry! When we asked for a replacement, the server set it down never said wow man sorry about that or hope this one is better. Nada just ignored the fact that they served a biscuit that if thrown at a small child would have knocked them out  Thanks for the experience..meh",

This is the new community relations with their employees on our neighborhood Facebook page from a Nick Todd referring to the Mexican children in our neighborhood:   \"Jamie Ritchey you're a real piece of shit.  Those little punks are antagonistic pieces of shit, they've started shit with me and Welcome Diner has had all kinds of problems with them antagonizing customers. I can't believe you'd defend that and attack someone's grammar, what a fucking lowlife you are!!  There wasn't any race baiting in Sammy's post, but those kids are Mexican and only seem to bother white people, so who's REALLY being racist?   Fuck those kids, fuck their shitty parents, and fuck you for saying they are \"good kids\".\"  The community doesn't dine here and we recommend you don't either.",

    "text": "I had seen this place being advertised on Welcome Chicken and Donuts' Instagram many times so I started following WD on Instagram as well. What made me come here was the many pictures of biscuit-y type foods and decadent sandwiches, and also that they're open from 5 p.m.- 2 a.m. 7 days a week!   I came here tonight with a friend last night (Sunday). I scrolled through the Yelp food photos to make a decision on what to order and the Mac N' Cheese caught my eye.  Vibes: Very hipster-y, there are seating indoors surrounding the kitchen, and outdoor patio seating as well with family-style picnic tables and round, metal tables with chairs. We sat outside at a table because the weather was pleasantly cooler than normal...a whooping 90 degrees!  Food:   The food menu consists of several options of biscuits- biscuits and gravy, fried chicken and biscuits, etc., also  I like that the prices of the meals here are pretty great.   *Mac N' Cheese* $8 for a decently sized portion of amazing macaroni and cheese is more than I could ask for. The macaroni is baked and has more sauce on the bottom so after mixing the noodles around, this dish is sooo yummy. The macaroni isn't too salty or way too cheesy, it's just perfect.  *Fried Green Onion Sandwich* I also tried a bite of the fried green onion sandwich and it satisfied my tastebuds. I was impressed!   *Berry and Ginger Pie* This pie has the one of the best crusts I've ever tasted! No \"soggy bottom\" as Paul Hollywood says. The flavors meld so well together and there is not too much sugar in this dessert. Lovely.  I didn't get to try the drinks, but I will definitely be back here soon and try different items on the menu, including the drinks.",

I particularly love that they offer veggie-friendly options.. their bbq jackfruit burgers and fries are amazing!! It can be hard to find restaurants that accommodate vegetarians, which makes this place even more special.  Just a heads up tho, the majority of seating here is outdoors. Aka. be prepared during the winter months for the cold/ during the summer months for the heat.. I think there are like 5 seats inside near the kitchen, but otherwise everything else is picnic benches or tables :) I'll definitely be back here once it's a little warmer again outside!",

I tend to like the more traditional restaurant experience so diners haven't really been in my wheelhouse thus far.   The location is in an interesting little area, you are driving down some residential streets and then bam there's a little clutch of restaurants.   I had the Welcome burger with fries and the food was great. I had no complaints about food at all.   For me this got a 4 out of 5 just because it was pure chaos when we were there. Instead of having one server we had 3 or 4 different people checking on us so there were some small miscommunications. It also felt a little hurried. It was a fairly busy night so I felt a little rushed to get out the door when we were eating which is not something I generally enjoy.   Other than that, great food, nice spot.",

So far I have tried the Captain Fantasy (talk about a kick) and the Bumble Bee (made with locally sourced honey) both have been fantastic. I have also had the Carol which is Kilt Lifter braised pulled pork on a biscuit, smoked in the back of course.   The service has always been really friendly. The atmosphere is really laid back.  You will want to eat outside, as the inside is really small.  Pretty much the opposite of the Tardis (a little geek joke, nod if you get it).  My Step son recently got one of their burgers, and he said it was one of the best burgers he has ever had.  Definitely on my list to try soon.  All in all, its a place you have to try. You will not be disappointed in any way. oh did I mention that they are locally owned and locally sourced? So not only can you get good food, but feel good about it to.",

My husband had the champion burger. He said it was really good, especially the bacon jam. My brother in-law has the big Jim. It was huge! A biscuit, giant piece of fried chicken and the thickest gravy ever! I tried some and it was so good! Creamy and sinful! The last thing I tasted was the Brussels sprouts. Omg! Goooood!

To late night burger runs to a disappointed Monday bike ride, I've loved it all. If I had my Monday back for every welcome burger I've had I might actually be able to afford a car but I regret nothing.

Great customer service, made us feel known and welcomed! That day I enjoyed the Welcome Burger with no regrets! Husband got the Big Jim & was very satisfied!   2nd patronage: I popped by for an iced coffee (they serve Lux brew) , and the gal working (can't remember her name now, but she's got blue hair ;) was super friendly! She even hooked me up with a refill for the price of free, I was like wow, these folks are nice :)  3rd patronage: we weren't feeling meat, so we tried the Vegan Po' Boy...was surprised at what a delicious sandwich it was, nothing poor about it!   Their fries are the best around. Their coleslaw is distinct. Their service is appreciated. I'm looking forward to enjoying more meals here.   I'm busy and really don't have time to write reviews, but I'll type one up for a local business I want to support! They also use all local AZ grown ingredients folks.   Don't be intimidated by the humble surroundings from the outdoor seating area. It's comfortable and unpretentious, a sweet little spot to enjoy some real good food.",

The food I ordered, fried green tomato sandwich and the big Jim, were very flavorful and tasty!  Con's: Big Jim needed more gravy!  It was so good but after 2 bites the gravy was gone and I was left with dry biscuit on awesome fried chicken. So the two bites I had...great!  The rest....a little dry.  And I hate to say it, but it took 45 minutes to get our food, 30 to get a single drink order.  This killlllss me!! Buuut it is a small place.    Verdict:  Glad I went and had a great time!  Will I be back?  Nope.  Once was enough",

We sat at the kitchen side bar by the cooks and I was thoroughly impressed with their organization and communication skills. The chefs cooking right in front of you showed more professionalism then some top restaurants I've been to. They moved around their space like a dance and cook the food perfectly! I sat and was mesmerized by the three cooks technique! They communicated so well with each other about cooking times and were just nailed every dish I watched them make. We ate Friday night after the nine inch nails concert on 9-14-18 and just so you know Welcome Diner, the three chefs you had working that night impressed my boyfriend and I so much! It was two males and one female. Kudos to those three especially and the rest of the staff was amazing as well! I ate the Gumbo and it had nopales (cactus) in it, which was marvelous! The flavor was amazing and I was so impressed with the presentation. My boyfriend had the chorizo meatloaf and he was very satisfied! Both dishes had unique Hispanic flare to them but kept the classic flavor your expecting. Chorizo Meatloaf! Such a great idea! Thank you Welcome Diner for having such unique and delicious food!",

I wasn't very interested in their drink options... but they did have a great selection of food items. I got the fish po'boy sandwich. The main problem I had with this was how much liquid came out. Once I picked it up a puddle soon developed on my plate and if I put my sandwich down it would get soggy. Well after holding it for a extended period of time with the juices running down my arms, and watching my husband eat all the fries, I finally put it down to grab a few. So then the bottom of my sandwich became extremely soggy. But the fish was still very good. And the sauce they gave us for the fries was also very good! I just wish their cups had been bigger.",

    "text": "Incredible place. You can tell the owners put a lot of care into their recipes. Seems like they opened it on a budget, since the restaurant is an old, small diner trailer put on a lot in a not-so-great part of town (area has improved dramatically since they started, it's now a decent area). There are some bar seats inside, but the main dining area is a patio. I love the character of this diner. It's unique and friendly.  My biggest complaint is that it could take up to 45 minutes for your food come out depending on how busy they are. However, the patio is a nice place to wait and enjoy drinks while you're waiting. Guessing this is a result of their tiny kitchen in the trailer and I hesitate to mention this complaint, since without that tiny kitchen Welcome Diner wouldn't be what it is.",

They still serve funky craft cocktails and downright delicious food with their signature twists to some pretty traditional meals. Please and Thank you, Welcome Diner!",

As we all know, that can lead to much disappointment but that just was not the case. The food here is as legit as my fellow yelpers have given it credit. For dinner, my wife and I tried to Poutine, the Big Jim, and the PO Boy Sandwich. Here our my thoughts:  Poutine-fries, gravy, and cheese....enough said. The gravy here is amazingly good. My only regret is not having my daughter with me to try it, as she loves a good gravy.   Big Jim-This dish is what one would expect from a five star dish. It was so dang good!!!!!!! Homemade biscuit, gravy, fried chicken, bacon, and cheese. Come on, how could it be better? It couldn't.....this thing was awesome. If you check out my wife's future review, I guarantee she will mention wanting this dish as her last supper. Perfect in every way!!!!  PO Boy- Good dish but not the Big Jim kind of good. My wife liked her sandwich and it was good, but not great. The fish and bread were very fresh. Our only thought, and what do we know, but thinking a dipping sauce of some kind would make this dish so much better. Solid four star item.  Staff here were very outgoing and friendly. The outside seating was comfortable. We were fortunate to have an outside heater near us to keep us cozy.   The diner was all I was hoping it would be and glad I finally had the chance to go. Just wish the hours were more accommodating for their new west valley fans. Will go back for sure if in the area when they are open. A must visit.",

Then we tried the old fashion. The luxardo cherry and orange peel made it very tasty. On our second visit, we tried the little bird, seafood etouffe and peanut cook. The biscuit and fried chicken were moist. We would get this again. The seafood etouffee was good but it lacked protein. The cookie had bitter chocolate on top. Together, it was just right, not too sweet or rich. It was still good if you didn't eat it with the chocolate.",

My husband got the bumblebee which was a biscuit sandwich with extra crispy fried chicken, honey, and mustard. He said he loved it, but not before he finished it because he didn't want to let me have a taste. We also shared the macaroni and cheese, sooooo creamy with great texture and crunch factor on top! Plus, we got to add chorizo which made that dish my husband's all time fave. My favorite was the pouting fries that we shared. Gaahhhhhh lee that is comfort food at BEST! I'm a ketchup girl but these fries hit all the right notes without any added condiments. The only con about this place is that seating is outdoors. The entire time my husband and I were fighting off flies and picking out debris falling from the tree from our food (it got really windy.) I'm sure the ambiance is much better when the weather isn't so annoying, but this was kind of a turn off for us. However, the food was SO worth fighting a fly army. Would visit again!",

Outside on the front lawn are many tables and chairs, as inside you will find only 9 seats at the very retro counter.  The menu is southern comfort food. Super greasy, generous portions, all cooked grilled and prepared in what is probably the smallest kitchen in the valley.  This is the spot for a behemoth burger, biscuits smothered in gravy, and even fried green tomatoes.  With a \"biscuits\" menu, featuring fried chicken drowning in country gravy, cheddar, and bacon - it is a bypass waiting to happen.  However, there are lighter healthier biscuit choices that come topped with sauteed Kale and fried egg...but this place truly is a destination for abandoning healthy choices and diving head first into fat and calories.",

My husband had the biscuits and gravy which he said were tasty, but nothing special to warrant the high price. I had a cheeseburger ordered medium rare and fries. The fries were shoestring. Not my favorite, but fries are fries. First bite into the burger and bloody juices exploded in my face and all over. The burger was rare, at best. It was dropping and the bun got instantly soggy.

    "text": "Whhhhaaaat?! I have not reviewed these guys?! It's possibly because I was hoping to keep them my little secret. These guys took their Old Dixie food truck and took over this unique and eclectic location that has been home to other popups over the last couple of years. Inside seating is VERY limited 8 built in stools against a small counter. I love sitting inside but I often enjoy their out door seating during the summer and especially on these beautiful Phx winter nights. [They do lunch and brunch as well.]   The Food: I have enjoyed everything I have tried here. They are known  for their biscuits, which are fairly large, sturdy enough to be used in their biscuit sandwiches but tender enough to enjoy with their homemade honey butter (the honey sourced from a small apiary in the neighborhood) or house made jelly/preserves or apple butter. Many of their veggies are often sourced out of the community garden when possible. They source locally as much as possible, and their menu adjusts seasonally, while keeping some of their popular favorites. They always offer vegetarian options and occasionally even vegan. [Skip the goat cheese on the beet tureen salad and that is a yummy vegan option]   They make all food to order and honor substitutions or additions within reason.  Heck, for dinner one night I ordered their biscuit with goat cheese and smoked apple butter (found on the dessert menu) and asked if they could add bacon.  They gave me a bit of a raised eyebrow as they found the request unique and gladly served it up (and it was SOOO good)   My favorites: Anything with their fried chicken.  Anything with their biscuits.  Their french fries are  hand cut and fabulous.  They smoke their own meats  (and sometimes apples for their smoked Apple butter) so try the Carolina or any smoked  sausage, pork chop, etc. that shows up on the specials board.  Their burgers rock! (YOU HAVE to try the PB&B, well unless you have a peanut allergy).  Their salads are lovely and tasty.   They offer some select cocktails and a limited choice of liquor. But this doesn't matter because all you need to know is get a HURRICANE (or 3). You'll thank me later.",

You drive up to this old, tiny diner with a variety of seating in front of it, and strings of lights hung up around the eating area. The vibe is very chill and feels like a funky neighborhood joint. You definitely feel at home, and I love that everyone feels welcome.   When ordering your FOOD you go up to a tiny window of the trailer and after find a seat. Once your food is ready, they call your name and bring your food over to your table. I was deciding between the Bumblebee biscuit sandwich and the Fried Green tomato sandwich. The guy at the counter said I should try the green tomato sandwich, so I did. AND IT WAS AWESOME.  It is seriously  a perfect combination of the crispy battered tomato plus the sweet corn and the savory spread and the crunchy sourdough bringing it all together. Such a genius sandwich! We also shared a poutine which was just gravy and yellow cheese (just different than other poutine that I have had). The gravy tasted really homemade and delicious.  The SERVICE was great. Everyone was friendly and very laid back and they really made you feel at ease.  I would say that the ONLY NEGATIVE is that once you get your food, the flies immediately sense it and are all over it. It just gets annoying, but it's not like anyone can control mother nature.",

    "text": "Oh my diner oh my diner oh my Diii-ner on Roosevelt--  So I usually don't eat at diners because food ain't all that great.  But where there is jackfruit I will follow.  Welcome Diner on Roosevelt and 10th Streets sells a lot of burgers and booze but they also offer a jackfruit po'boy ($8) and several other interesting veggie dishes.  Even though I fancy the taste of sweet, juicy, ripe jackfruit, it's also scrumptious when cooked and used like a vegetable.  This is the fourth spot where I've had jackfruit in a sandwich (or taco) and 'twas delicious.    Paired with a cabbage slaw that adds crunch to the 'wich, the flavor was mild and hearty.  I requested no BBQ sauce because that sickly sweetness would have disturbed the taste of the fruit.  My only regret is no side was included in the price.  Welcome Diner also sells a fried green tomato sammich. ($8.5)  Doesn't that sound delicious?   [crickets]  Doesn't it?  Okay, well maybe it's just me.  And lesson learned:   \"Sounding\" delicious and tasting delicious are two entirely different senses.  The sourdough was oily, toasted with a few slices of breaded fried tomatoes laid in-between.  And a fried tomato is...well...it tastes...uhhhh...urrrr...well...well, at least it's a vegetable, damn it Janet.    No side either.   If it wasn't for the arugula, corn relish, and ranch dressing on the sandwich, it would have been a complete disappointment.  Ya' hurd meh?  Complete. Disappointment.     And so TOMATO gets added to the list of things that should not be fried and passed off as food.  (That list is quite long, but let me not diverge from the review.)     Anyway, I will return someday for another jackfruit po'boy, but at $8 bucks with no side, my next visit won't be too soon.",

After checking out the reviews and the menu, my wife and I decided to grab a late dinner here on a Friday night. As soon as we arrived I noticed this place just had an awesome vibe to it. Friendly staff, laid back patio seating, and the food is beyond amazing. We had the Fried Green Tomato sandwich, Little Birdy fried chicken biscuit, Fries, and a glass bottle Coke (the kind sweetened with real sugar).   In a nutshell: Love this place. We'll be going back again and again.",

Unfortunately, it doesn't work. It's too much bread and not enough flavor. Sausage gravy is tasteless. Only two hot sauces are offered. Tabasco and Crystal. Even with that, food needs more flavor. From what I can gather, very little nuance or spice is used in their food. unfortunately, it's all very pricey for above average diner food.   Very limited beer selection (4 taps - nothing special). More focus on cocktails.  Great space, they're all working very hard, super friendly service.  The bathroom is smaller than an airplane bathroom. You are literally in a mobile home restaurant. Not much they can do about that, but it's very cramped.  Great patio!  3 1/2 stars.",

They have a good mix of drink deals (like $1 off draft beer and $6 cocktails) and food specials. I had the little birdie and the pork fries. The little birdie sandwich was very good, but I wish the batter in the fried chicken had a little more seasoning to it. The biscuit was great though,  nice and soft. The pork fries were great, the cabbage slaw on top of them was just the right topping. Overall, this place is definitely worth checking out. It has a great trendy atmosphere and their menu items are wonderful!",

Arrived on a Saturday night and there was such limited seating; the place was packed! Ordered their arugula and watermelon salad: fresh and tasty, but honestly, not worth the hype. Also tried the \"Koko\" and the \"Carol\". The Koko is a fried chicken sandwich with a chipotle ranch sauce-good and a bit spicy! The Carol was better; pulled pork topped with somewhat spicy coleslaw--this dish was a great, complexity of flavors that melded well together. Will have to return to try more of their dishes!",

I also ordered a side of hand cut fries and those were amazing as well. Definitely recommend this place and I'll come back again. Have low expectation for seating and be open minded, you'll have fun.  Another update.... The new location is amazing. They moved and have a larger indoor seating area and even larger outdoor area. Food was still amazing, I got the grilled cheese and it just was AMAZING.",

    "text": "Finally! A brand new Welcome Diner location where you can actually sit inside during the blistering Phoenix heat!   Well, that's if you're lucky. Show up on the weekends after 6pm and you can forget about it.  Anyway, what I've always liked about \"Welcome\" is the simplicity of their menu. The options are not overwhelming, the quality is extremely high, and the food is sourced from all the right places. While not everything I've had here is perfect, it's very difficult to go wrong with most of their options.  Once I point out a handful of hipster cliches to my girlfriend, I always feel a little more at ease once I see that we're not the only people in our thirties dining here. Everyone can come here - even if you're not wearing a beanie or have a beard.   As for the food, classic staples are all found here, carried over from their old location, such as my all-time favorite grilled cheese sandwich in all of its smokiness. The spectacular chicken biscuit sandwiches, burgers that put most places to shame, and those damned poutine fries that everyone seems to crave.  Desserts are tough. You might find yourself thrilled with something, but might end up damning other customers to hell for depleting their inventory of something you were hoping to try. I've tried a variety of their pies, which are all just fine - but not really anything that I feel stands out.   Anyway, I still give Welcome Diner high praise for proving that not all diner food has to be greasy, disgusting, low-grade crap. When the right people are running the show, Welcome's loyal fanbase is very much deserved.   Highly recommended!",

We (4 of us) had to wait about 45 minutes to be seated that wasn't horrible but we asked to see a menu while we waited and the hostess said she would see if she could find one... We watched the two servers scramble around really not paying attention to customers one customer was ready to pay and it took 15 minutes for the server to take their payment which meant we had to wait an additional 15 minutes. Service was s-l-o-w finally after 20 minutes someone came over and took our order we ordered the poutine fries first but got them the same time we got our food also note getting a water filter would be great Arizona water is horrible and not filtering it makes it undrinkable. The food was different we had the Seafood etoufee, Jambalaya, Gumbo and Burger. It was tasty but nothing really special...Please note both servers were very nice just not as attentive as one would like.",

My exact words as I tried my first bite was, \"Ok.. this would be my last meal on earth if I had to pick one.\"  That is saying a lot considering my love for good food.  I'm not sure if I truly meant it or I was in a food coma  Either way, it's on a top favorite list now.   This place has charm and is sure to impress your tastebuds.  We sat outside on a rustic picnic table with white lights, heat lamps and ate some seriously good grub. The hubby got the \"Big Jim\" which I'm not sure I can find words to describe. A home made biscuit with the best gravy you could ever ask for, fried chicken and bacon under it all. One bite of this thing and you will be hooked.  I can't say enough about this dish.. just GET IT.  I went for the healthier grilled fish sandwich, which was loaded with flavor.  An extremely well seasoned piece of fish and some slaw on top.  We also got a side of fries smothered in the famous, fabulous, unforgettable gravy. This Diner also serves mixed drinks if you'd like to visit and kick back a while.   The Welcome Diner should be bookmarked on everyone's Yelp!  I'm not sure about the other items on the menu but I imagine they are outstanding.",

    "text": "REVIEWER #667th:   Well first of all I want to start this review off by saying that I'm honored to be The one to move us past the 666th review. I would like to thank all my in-laws for bringing me to the welcome dinner to make this all possible.  This place is actually pretty nice and the food is actually pretty good. I'll be honest I wasn't expecting it to be as good as it was. Their homemade ginger beer is a must. I pretty much ordered half the menu all the items on the menu were super solid:  Luxardo Salad 5/5: They did a great job on this one the go cheese was not overwhelming and it was balanced out by the apples they offer a dressing on the side which there really was no need for and I never used.  Jumbayala 5/5: probably the best jambalaya I have ever had. My only qualm about this one is I asked if it was spicy he said no. I'm kind of a wimp when it comes to spicy food and it was in my opinion decently spicy. But the texture was amazing perfect balance of chicken.  BIG JIM 5/5: The key to this being so good is 100% the biscuit. The biscuit is moist and a perfect complement to the gravy and chicken. The portion is definitely enough to fill a person.   Beignets 4/5: The beignets  are pretty good but they are pretty deep fried as well. I like my Beignets  a little bit softer on the inside.   Goat cheese and preserves 2/5: this was probably the only downside to my meal. I think they should've made the preserves a little bit sweeter as it is a dessert. The goat cheese overwhelmed the taste and made it kind of sour.     Summary: we went there around 10 PM, outside seating was nice nice ambience to the place the table we sat at had not been cleared and we had to go ask somebody to clear it, or we could've played it ourselves but they didn't have a place for that. There was a drunk lady that was smoking next to us that I had to ask her to put our cigarette, but she was fairly kind about it. But then 20 minutes later another guy lit one up a feet away from us.   The smoking is the primary reason I gave it 4/5 stars. I would've liked to of seen management be a little bit stricter on that. Nobody wants to breathe in your nasty smoke when they're trying to enjoy a meal with their family. They do have bicycle parking, and you can rent some on the street as well. They're open late which is nice as well. Overall I really enjoyed it and would go back! :)",

    "text": "My expectations got dumped on after I came to Welcome Diner. We came for some passable late night grub. Instead we got kickass grub and some really nice drinks.  Of course we come on a Tuesday - clearly the best day because it was happy hour all day. Between my group we had a Hurricane, Gin and Tonic, Whiskey Sour, a Little Birdy, and an order of Poutine.  Happy hour drinks at $5-6, you don't expect much. But these staples actually hold their own against bars that would sell theirs for $10+. The gin and tonic was refreshing with the addition of lime juice. The Whiskey Sour had a nice balanced tart flavor from the fruit. And the Hurricane was basically alcoholic juicy goodness.  From the food, literally comfort food at its finest. The Little Birdy - that in house biscuit, plus that awesome succulent fried chicken and slice of cheese - some of the best $5 I've ever spent. And the Poutine is glorious. Probably some of the most conservative, it's close to the traditional sense of just gravy and cheese, but they opt to use a peppery country style gravy and cheddar cheese. It's makes you feel a little worse and better at the same time.  The fact that this place is basically in the middle of a sketchy neighborhood actually added to the appeal for me. It's a bright spot with outdoor seating that makes you want to have a good time. Can't wait to come back.",

With the community dining, eclectic patio furniture and the always engaging staff this place really exemplifies what food should be. Good, local and comfortable.

    "text": "Back in 2005 I came to Welcome Diner and would enjoy really tasty breakfast sandwiches.  I loved the husband/wife team who took care of the customers and made the place pretty darn awesome.  I know in the past few years there've been a few different concepts that hit Welcome Diner... I didn't patronize the place since back in 2005/2006, but went back last night at about 9pm to check it out.  I took some of the pictures that are up on this Yelp review back then when I was DowntownGirl.  With my man and a friend of ours, we stopped over to the same quaint trailer that seemed to be a bit more polished up with a more bold \"Welcome Diner\" painted on the front, but pretty much looked the same from back when I used to go.  There was a special on the board and they had menus with some eclectic items.  Two of us chose the South Carolina-style pork sandwich on a biscuit and a side of fries while our friend grabbed the peanut butter bacon burger and some Sweet Republic ice cream.   We sat outside instead of in.  We also grabbed some wine and beer.  Local WINES!  So glad to be able to go to an establishment in downtown Phoenix where they offer local wine.   We got our food after a short wait and dove in.  Top notch delicious foods all around.  I know they have a brunch menu... guess we'll have to ride down some Saturday or Sunday morning.  Tasty food, friendly staff... we'll be back.",

(I actually created an account just to review this place)  The atmosphere is worth the trip alone, cool set up with outdoor seating (nice lights at night) and a rad mural on the fence. Super cool staff, real friendly!  Anyway, THE FOOD, The food is amazing, I have been traveling the U.S for 2 months and I haven't tasted anything that would come close to this! I had the fried avocado po'boy and a side of Brussels sprouts. The Brussels sprouts were delicious, I think they were pan fried with oil and some herb, and the po'boy was probably the BEST THING I HAVE EVER EATEN! But seriously, it was delicious, And it's served with diced watermelon on the side, blends nicely, and whoever thought of deep fried avocado is a god dam genius!!!!    I wasn't sure what to expect when I got there, I was just going from the reviews on yelp. And they were right!  So do yourself a favor and head on down to welcome diner and hook in to some of there great food!!!   My only regret is that I leave tomorrow and only got to visit once :(",

As for seating there are two options either outside on their \"patio\" (felt like someones front yard with chairs) or inside which gave you more of an old school dining car feel. I ordered there PB + B burger and my husband had their shrimp Po'boy special. I had heard eating Peanut butter on your burger was good so of course I had to give it a try. I must say it was a bit odd but very good, the burger was very juicy and flavorful, the bacon and cheese gave it that salty taste that went great along side the crunchy peanut butter. I would say it probably isn't for everyone and fair warning it is very heavy on the stomach... about half way through it just hits you and realize just how full you are lol. My husband's Shrimp Po'Boy was very good, the bread was super fresh and the tomato base spread gave it amazing flavor, I would say it was more of a \"Prawn\" Po'boy because the shrimp were so big. Overall the food was very good, I am a bit skeptical about the outdoor seating it was just a little too weird for me, I would definitely go back but would prefer to sit inside if there is room. I hope they continue to do well and maybe they'll be able to expand.",

The three young guys working were having a great time cooking, talking to guests and listening to, oddly enough, late-60's rock music.  Had the Big Jim and Poutine.  Ate about 2/3 of the first and 1/4 of the second only because it's an incredible amount of food.  Great tasting comfort food at great prices.  Would recommend.",

The burgers have always been cooked as I like them (whatever your preference is...) The fries are organic potatoes, cut daily- sometimes a little on the brown side in appearance but they always taste good.  Grilled cheese is great- not too greasy like some places.  There are sodas and iced tea to drink- both organic.  ENVIRONMENT 8  seats inside and outdoor seating availible. I would recommend eating outside if it is nice- sometimes inside is crowded and everyone can hear everyone else's business.   OTHER Bring cash, no cards accepted. If your service is good- tip them.

But don't worry - if you need some space and want to enjoy the amazing AZ weather there's a HUGE patio and fun little order window... something for everyone!

Though on the pricey side, the food was good (I had a BBQ pork plate and my guest a burger) and the menu selection seemed adequate. We sat outside and enjoyed our meals, sipping on hurricanes, while appreciating that Welcome Diner is, for lack of a better explanation, a hipsters diner done absolutely right. The food, the service, the facility...all are within a clear and well executed vision. And while I respect that vision, I think that, for me, it was just too much. Specifically, the outdoor seating is more stylish than properly relaxing as their comfort food is. Sitting at a picnic table or some old outdoor furniture that looks like it just came from the back of an old shed is too hipster for me. I get it. I get the theme. I get the execution. It just doesn't work for me. But I would definitely eat their grub if I were in the area looking for take out.",

The service is ridiculously pleasant, with various servers casually checking in with you and chatting you up during the meal. Dinner was probably one of the best meals we have ever had- to start: pulled pork fries smothered in tangy BBQ sauce and topped with homemade cool coleslaw. Then the Welcome Burger, which was moan inducing and gone in about 4 bites. We followed this with their summer salad of watermelon, tomato, ginger pickled rinds, and arugula surrounded by a delicious basil cashew pesto. Unbelievably refreshing. To finish we went with the honey drizzled beignets and basically licked the plate clean. Oh and also the cocktails here are amazing - heaven on earth. And we spent about $60 on all of it. Such a ridiculous bargain. Writing this from the lovely shaded patio waiting for our eggs and biscuits to arrive. We might never leave!",

Even if this establishment wasn't within walking distance from my house I would drive 50 miles for the Chicken biscuit sandwiches and amazing burgers they serve. The service is outstanding, the ambiance is mellow, friendly, and casual. A perfect place for a first date, group gathering, or drinks with friends. The hours are phenomenal (they are open super late or super early). Check them out!",

We got the bumblebee and big jack with a side of Mac and cheese (added bacon). Wasn't a huge fan of Mac and cheese... It tasted a bit strange. The bumblebee was amazing with added hot sauce. I didn't try the big Jack because he finished it in two bites which meant it was pretty good! Best cheat meal there ever was - minus the Mac and cheese. It was a bit more expensive than I thought it would be... 47 with tip.",

As a visitor to Phoenix, I am not use to this heat but the calm warm nights are the perfect setting for outdoor seating (though there is a small indoor diner bar). There are plenty of tables, lights and a gatorade water cooler to satisfy that thirst.  I got the Big Jim and a side of Brussels sprouts ($14 total).  Brussels Sprouts are cut large and I felt they could have been cooked down a bit more or cut smaller for my liking.  The Big Jim on the other hand was quite tasty.  Fried Chicken, Biscuit and Gravy.  How good is that?  Oh, there is bacon and cheese too....damn. I would ask for extra gravy on the side next time.  Watermelon on the side was a perfect pairing to this rich dish.

So the two guys in there really have to hustle and work around each other. The food is top quality as well. My boyfriend and I split a PB&B Burger and the Bumblebee chicken sandwich on a biscuit. The chicken was probably my favorite, but it was impossible to eat like a lady. It's stacked so high that in order to get some in your mouth, you have to get some on your face. I gave up and just started stabbing at it with my fork.   The best part of Welcome Diner is the atmosphere: twinkling lights, picnic style seating, and friendly staff. I'm not sure who was working this last Saturday night, but he was so friendly and knowledgeable. We had a good little conversation about the history of the diner car.   This would be a great date place ... if that's something you're looking for. This is also a good place for a group of around 6 friends to take over a picnic table.",

We ordered at 10:10 pm according to my receipt, and the food finally arrived at 11:10pm, 1 hour later.  Very disappointing to see all the customers that were in line after myself getting their orders ahead of us.  Our friends were finishing their plates when my order finally arrived, small, burnt and nuclear hot on the inside.  What really capped the disappointment was when the waiter came by to ask how all the food was tasting and I told him I don't know because we have no food to taste, it had been 50 minutes on a 30 min promise and our food still was not here.  He asked what our name was and went back to check, then came back and said they have started working on it now, to which I replied, \"What were they doing for the last 45 minutes if not making our order?\" to which he had no reply.  The Welcome burger looked big and nice and I was really excited to see what I was going to get for a grilled cheese with 3 different cheeses.  When it finally did arrive, it was burnt on the outside and cool to the touch, but Scorching hot on the inside.  They must have used a microwave to re-heat the sandwich, because I can still feel the burn on my mouth the next day.  Not only was the grilled cheese hot, it was also extremely small.  I was thinking something substantial after seeing the mac and cheese on the \"Snack\" menu the size of a small child's head, but the grilled cheese sandwich was more like an appetizer for one, not an entree.  If only I could give them 1/2 a star for the unlimited cold ice water, and the outdoor patio dining room, which were the only good things about the restaurant.",

No matter, the service was enthusiastic and personal, the food delicious, the atmosphere authentically hipster. I had the fried green (red) tomato sandwich which was positively nuclear, the way I like it. Health food no doubt. What a great place. Wish we could have had some drinks because they had interesting ones, but my companion had Hurricane Juice and said it was the best juice he ever had. A mix of fresh juices would definitely benefit from rum.",

The poutine and the mac n' cheese are my go to's whenever we go here.    The seating is open and we love sitting in the 6-seater counter top in the old trailer they work out of.  Being practically an arm's reach away from the kitchen stove is awesome because you get to hear and smell the food cooking which is phenomenal. This is exactly what comfort food should be; greasy and flavorful and rich!  Another draw of coming here is where it is located.  Sitting on the street corner in the midst of older craftsman style historic homes and strung lights about their patio is so charming.  I love coming to this part of Phoenix, always great people-watching and fun atmosphere.   The staff here are so awesome and friendly and make the experience here that much greater!  I highly highly recommend this place if you are looking for amazing, local, FRESH food.   Just come here, period. You won't regret it.",

I got the eggplant parm special. The breading for the eggplant was on point but I realized I'm not a fan of soggy bread so that kills it cuz you need the sauce. Supper yummy sandy though! I also tried the Bumble Bee. It is served on a biscuit (so warm/so soft) fried chix w/a bourbon mustard sauce, mmmm bread and butter pickles and sits in honey all fancy. This is a tasty eat....although be warned the mustard saucy is a tad kicky w/the bourbon, was a suprise for me! Anyways so worth going, open late and I love eating outside picnic table style.",

I thought it would be a good place to take dear papa for lunch; turns out they open at 5 pm. So we made our way through rush hour traffic from north Phoenix to this \"middle of nowhere\" place on a Tuesday night. I expected small but I didn't expect teeny tiny. However, the warm and genuinely friendly service- YEP we felt WELCOME - more than made up for the close quarters. Our fish po'boys  and beignets in local honey were SUPERB!

I was a little unsure if I was headed to the right place, since Welcome Diner is located in a neighborhood, but I'm so glad that I found it.  My food was delicious and the staff seemed genuinely friendly and interested in how I thought that the food was, which is always the sign of a good chef.  I did have to wait a little bit, but I didn't mind too much, since it's a small establishment.  People should be forewarned that there is very limited seating indoors and that most of the seating is outdoors on the patio.  I personally thought that it was nice to sit outside, especially with the mural on painted on the fence/wall, but I understand that it might not be so comfortable to sit outside at the picnic tables in extremely hot Phoenix weather, especially if it was a busy day and you had to share a bench/table with a bunch of people you don't know.  I got a fried green tomato sandwich on sourdough with house-made corn salsa and arugula.  It was fantastically delicious.  The ingredients were fresh and everything from the toasting of the bread to the battering of the tomatoes was well-executed.  Although the sandwich was filling and came with a slice of cantaloupe, I wish that it had come with some sort of side, like home-made potato chips, for the price.  Alongside my sandwich, I had a tasty Four Peaks stout.",

The guy that was taking our order was just rude and not happy at all. It seem like he was upset about something and was taking it on us. It was our first time being there and I would of thought that the guy would of mention the daily special or even recommend he's favorite dish but instead was so commanding and rude. To make matters worse; we did not get our food until an hour later. The burger was dry and not tasty. There was no love to the burger. I don't think I'll go back or recommend this place to my friends or family.",

Dont be deceived or be scared by the neighborhood, it is not the suburbs, it is within a residential area in Downtown Phoenix. This place is a cross between a food truck that mutated into a tiny diner: the inside has 9 seats and a bar and their kitchen and outside has this \"picnic\" feel which has tables with umbrellas and chairs. Our family of 5 (with kids ages 8, 7 and 5) chose to sit inside. We were there upon opening, the waiter and cook (Wayne and Clay, if I remember correctly) were very attentive to our family's needs. My hubby got the Big Jim. He said he loved his food except for the biscuit, but he said hes not really into biscuits. But the chicken and gravy were tasty and well-seasoned. Had the fish po' boy and it was juicy! My kids and I were passing our plates, stuffing our faces with each bite of their grilled cheese with rustic tomatoes sandwich, sunrise and my po boy. My 5 year old son whos a really picky eater almost finished his sanwich and thats a lot for him! Im giving Welcome Diner 4 stars, I wish you have more beverage choices for kids like freshly squeezed OJ? Nevertheless, we will be back!",

If you've answered yes to any of these questions (and we both know you did), you need to get down to The Welcome Diner. The cozy quarters and kitchy decor make it easy to fall in love with, and the staff makes you comfortable enough to stay for hours. AND THE FOOD! I have yet to try something that didn't make me smile. It's hard to pick a favorite dish but personally, I love the Kiltlifter braised pork biscuit. The carolina mustard sauce that's made in house, is probably the best thing I've ever tasted. And the made from scratch biscuit it comes with, is too good for words.  Beyond a fantastic, locally driven food concept, they also make one of the greatest cocktails I've ever enjoyed; the Hurricane. And even though you clearly hear the bell dinging from the kitchen and everyone inside scream, \"HURRICANE!\" each time you order one, you just can't seem to figure out how you got so tipsy; they're sneaky little guys.  So, next time you're out and about downtown Phoenix on a weekend, you should go say hi, and then eat your face off. You'll be glad you did.",

Phoenix was hot (really hot), congested, and filled with erratic drivers, leading to stress and grumpiness. The Welcome Cafe took us in with open arms. Awesome food, awesome drinks, awesome people. We laughed and joked with everyone at the bar like they were family. We'd be here at least once a week if we lived here. Well Done!!",

Since it was my first time (and I was starving) I also order a side of sausage gravy and the grit cake. This wasn't a cheap lunch at about $20 with a sweet tea, but it did knock me on my a$$. I ended up splitting the entire sandwich with a friend and we were both stuffed to the gills. My only complaint (very minor) was that the grit cake could have been a teensy weensy bit larger. Other than that I was totally satisfied with the meal, setting and staff.  Thanks Welcome Diner! Happy to have you in the neighborhood!",

I thought it was good but would try something else next time. My husband ordered beignets. They were good and the closest thing to NOLA I've had outside of the real thing. I probably would've liked them more if the honey was served on the side instead of under the beignet.   Before you think I'm crazy, trust me on this-the Brussels sprouts were awesome! They're not your mamas Brussels sprouts! My husband, not a big fan typically, thought they were great too. Every meal since then when we discuss what veggie to have with our home meals I ask for Brussel sprouts. Not any but THEIRS. I could probably go vegetarian on these things. Flat out YUMMY!  5 stars for just the brussel sprouts? While they deserved it, the 5 stars comes because it's a seriously cool business. Everyone who works there is incredibly friendly.   Basically it's a bunch of really cute guys, most in bands, who not only have great personalities but they are awesome cooks. They are very aware of local (when possible), quality, natural/organic (when possible) food and are creative with their dishes. I'll be back and I'm bringing some GFs next time. ;-)",

When you're done taking in the awesomeness of the outdoor seating strategically placed around beautiful trees and string lighting, you get to the walk up window where you check out their ever changing specials menu board or the regular menu with a wide variety of fun dishes to choose from. They also have a full bar with a drink menu which I was pretty happy about! The food is all made in house with the very freshest local ingredients, even down to the Chipotle ranch dressing (which was to die for) the staff was fun, friendly and charismatic and the price was fantastic for the quality! And to top it all off, they were easily able to accommodate our large birthday group!  I will definitely be going back with as many people as I can drag with me to show off this hidden gem in downtown Phoenix!",

    "text": "Back when Welcome Diner was just burgers, hot dogs, and giant chocolate chip cookies served on greasy paper plates speckled with ants (or \"protein sprinkles\" as momma called 'em) it was simply a welcome diner. Now it's so much more than that.  Have you ever watched someone hand you a glass of local red wine blend through a trailer window? How about a Sazerac? Well, it's time to change that. (Here I am assuming you said no. If you said yes, please un-see this section and continue.) When you start your meal with a southern throwback cocktail and finish it with homemade beignets, you best believe that whatever comes in between is going to knock your socks off. This is fine because you're probably sitting outside, so the dress code is pretty nonexistent, anyway.  My crew ordered the three most talked-about items on the menu. The peanut butter burger is the safe option + a bit of \"flare\" that is essentially peanut sauce. The meat is delicious, as is the bun and everything else between it. We also had the Carol, which was a unique BBQ pulled pork & biscuit sandwich with slaw... a mustard-y spin on a stack of down-home delicious. Last but DON'T YOU EVER THINK LEAST, the Bumblebee fried chicken & biscuit sandwich with honey and amazing b&b pickles. Us Southerners opted to scoot the mustard to the side and let the honey shine, but you could probably do anything to this fried chicken and it would still be incr-edible. Just get it. Get a bucket of it.  Now let's talk beignets. (Don't you wish people said that to you more often? You're welcome.) You can get them with powdered sugar & honey or peanut butter & jam. The waitress literally said the pb&j beignets were her favorite thing in the world, and then quickly added her daughter as a frontrunner to the favorites list. Not knowing her taste in dessert, or daughters for that matter, I trusted her immediately and was thrilled with the combination of light, lemony fried dough juxtaposed with fresh berries and creamy peanut butter. Ain't nothing wrong with the classic, but damn it, it's 2014. The matrimony between pb&j and beignet shouldn't even be questioned.  TL;DR - The Welcome Diner isn't just tasty, it's soulful and lovely. Bring an insatiable appetite and leave with a permasmile.",

    "text": "This place is AWESOME!!! It's a laid back, casual, hole in the wall, neighborhood gem.  LOVE that there is this historic looking little diner in the middle of what appears to be a residential area.  Reminds me of the historic district back home.   I picked my husband up from the airport at 11pm and thought, \"Hey...why not?! Let's try it!\".  I'm SO glad we did.    It was PACKED.  I asked if they were always that busy and he said \"Yep.  Often busier.  We use fresh ingredients and make good food.  It makes a big difference.\"   I felt like a newbie ordering, asking for a receipt, etc. (because they were so busy), but they were as patient as they could be.  My husband and I both ordered biscuits and gravy to go.  He ordered his with two over-medium fried eggs and I ordered mine with a side of brussel sprouts.   While we were waiting, he had a soda and I had the Ginger Beer.  The Ginger Beer was knock your socks off spicy, but I'm sure it's what saved me from a night full of tummy troubles (eating rich biscuits and gravy right before bed is probably not a good idea).  It was definitely homemade and packed a TON of ginger punch. It will make your throat burn in a good way.  The food was outstanding.  The biscuits were sliced in half, toasted, and accompanied by the super thick, rich sausage gravy.  For us, the gravy had a bit too much heat (excessive black pepper, perhaps cayenne...not sure), but...it was still VERY tasty and we both ate every bit. His eggs were perfect and my sprouts were fantastic with just the right amount of caramelization and oil/butter.   We will definitely be back and often.  :)",

We sat at the bar top inside since it was so crowded, and it was awesome to watch the chefs and staff work. Whole team seemed extremely stoked to serve us and be at work which is always a positive. This was last Saturday btw, and there was a line out the door.   I got the Honeybee sandwich and the Brussels sprouts. I tried my friend's jackfruit Po Boy and regular Po Boy. The food was perfect. The exact right amount of home style food with a bit of a twist.   My friends and I also shared a bottle of Provisioner white. We sell it at my work for $12 and I was pleased that they sold it by the bottle for $15. Paired deliciously with the food.   I will definitely be back on Tuesday for all night happy hour.

They do have indoor seating but very limited. The crowd was very hipster/bohemian/eclectic, I think that covers it. We even sat with a table full of complete strangers (cause that's what I do) they were a fun group of folks.   We decided on the Mac and cheese along with the biscuits and gravy. They were both delicious and the biscuits were sooooo good. Oh and the homemade ginger beer (non alch) was really good too. Unfortunately we were to full to try the beignets, but will def try next time.  Overall this is a place I would go out of my way to go enjoy some good food and some good people. Staff was very personable and great at making suggestions on what to try!  Neighborhood is def sketch as some Yelpers have commented on... But we no scared..lol",

Well, thanks to yelp, good food isn't too far from the airport.    3.1 miles away from the airport is a piece of heaven called Welcome Diner.  So don't be confused that you are driving in the middle of a residential area, and bam, you see this red and white building and bright red umbrellas everywhere!  Next to the building is another bright red object (aka the fence), but this time it's a red painting of a little boy eating what looks like bread.  I'm a bit confused but I'm already getting a good vibe from this place!  So now unto the food.  Mini-me is a sucker for orange juice, and luckily they had freshly squeezed OJ.  This is a minor detail for some folks, but I'm a sucker for freshly squeezed OJ.  I had the holy puerco, and it was sinfully fantastic.  Imagine a layer of sliced polenta, a layer of carnitas, and then a layer of eggs over medium, and finally it's sprinkled with crunchy chicharones.  Yes, it was a stack of deliciousness!  The hubby had the burger with a bacon jam, and I think he enjoyed it since he had no crumbs left at the end of the meal.  Honestly, I was so pleased with my holy puerco that I ignored the entire family.      Phoenix peeps, check this place out.  Don't forget to check out their daily specials and drinks and desserts.  I will definitely stop by the next time I'm in PHX.",

My go-to item on the menu has been the fried green tomato sandwich (a waiter suggested I added bacon to make it a BLT, and I LOVE it)! Crispy bread, zesty corn relish... it's awesome!  Last night, we tried a new menu item: the jambalaya.  I've been to New Orleans a few times and tried cajun restaurants across Phoenix (unfortunately, few can get those flavor profiles right). But this jambalaya? Damn! I think cajun-foodies will be extremely pleased! The taste is like homemade New Orleans cooking, yet the dish is still unique. It's a lil smokey, a lil spicy, and super flavorful. I hope they keep it on the menu, because I'll be coming back for more!",

I had the pulled pork fries and some poutine! Both were delicious!! The pulled pork has somes mustardy type sauce on it that is quite unusual but good!  The poutine is made with a white gravy and American cheese instead of the traditional brown gravy and cheese curds but very delicious and american dinerish.  Would definitely order again! I also had a hurricane, omg, sooo good! Loved it, really fruity and refreshing!!  My friend had the burger that he said was very good!! I look forward to going back and trying more things!",

Driving to this place was interesting as it is in an old section just east of downtown Phoenix, could describe it as 'The 'hood', but as we drove up and saw the place and patrons lined up to order outside, I told my wife, 'we gotta do this' and it was very good! Try the 'Big Jim', it's delicious, my wife had the 'Welcome Burger' and she said it was one of the best burgers anywhere. They do have Craft beers and a bar, but you better like it 'kozy' 'cause that bar is inside this little trailer-like restaurant; seating for eating is outside. You really  should try this place, it's a cool, little place that will surprise you! Oh, save room for the Beignets!",

The fried chicken that comes in any of their chicken n biscuit sandos is on par w the best Ive had anywhere. Its white meat but soooooo moist w perfectly crunchy breading. It is served w their biscuit that matches up w some of the best Ive had,  even in the Carolinas.  We also had the poutine, the PBB burger, the grilled cheese, mac&cheese (you can choose toppings; we had brussel sprouts and confit tomato), and the beignets(served in a dish of honey and powdered sugar). They were all outstanding you can taste the love thats put into making this food.  Its picnic/family style seating in an outdoor patio that lights up nicely at night. If youre travelling to this place to eat, we already have something in common so i dont mind sitting w strangers.",

It was very hard to enjoy the juicy burger they cooked up for me while I was constantly ducking and dodging the damn bees. Though good, I felt it wasn't a lot of bang for my buck. $10 and some change for a burger and a side of hashbrowns (plus they ask for a tip on the tablet from which you order before you get served, which is kinda out of order). I'll still give it a 4 because this little place has heart...and character.",

But forget burgers - if you go there, you've gotta get the fried chicken, bacon, cheddar, and gravy biscuit sandwich. It will blow your mind.

I've eaten here a handful of times and everything is so freaking good.  Its comfort food at its best.  And the staff is super friendly and helpful.  They treat you like a regular even if its your first time.  I love the fact that they source all their ingredients from local farmers and purveyors.  I initially thought the prices were a bit on the high side, but once I realized just how well the locally sourced ingredients were prepared, I now feel like its a bargain.  And I also love that they are open until midnight every day (except Monday).  This is just the coolest little place to grab some great food, a good drink, and chill with really friendly people.  I hope this place is around for a very long time.",

It was all freakin' delicious! The Big Jim is definitely big, stacked with fried chicken, melted cheddar, bacon and delicious gravy on a homemade biscuit. I was in hog heaven! The Holy Puerco was fried grits layered with pulled pork, house-made, tangy South Carolina BBQ sauce, a fried egg, chicharrones and a side of hash browns. Holy Puerco indeed!!! It was sooo good. That sauce was the very best part. I was happy to see their ingredients were locally sourced and just about everything was made in-house. Quality! We definitley want to come back to try dinner one night and we will absolutely be bringing friends here in the future. The staff was awesome (and very entertaining) and the ambiance was very laid back. Can't wait to come back! Thanks Welcome Diner!",

The menu is very limited (hamburgers and hot dogs) but everything that can be gotten from a local grower or manufacturer is. They have a great variety of Southwestern toppings that they will chop and grill freshly for every burger and dog. The fries are freshly cut and delicious. The guys that run the diner are friendly and the prices are reasonable. The hours are from 11 am to 3 pm Monday through Saturday and it is a cash only operation (my only complaints!). The counter inside is tiny and seats less than 10. There are some tables outside, and a take-out window. When we were there, Matt, the owner of Matt's Big Breakfast, was also getting lunch, and it was great to hear how a number of the owners of the downtown small restaurants and shops are long time friends and all support each other. Quaint places with young, hip owners, offering high quality food and goods make us feel positively about living in an often maligned part of town. We'll be back often to support the Welcome Diner.",

It's a quirky place with outdoor seating only. The small building looks like a diner. The employees were really pleasant and helpful. I ordered the Big Jim, my sister had the Fried Green Tomatoe Sandwich. We had fries on the side. The fries and dip that went with them were fantastic. Something in the dip gave it a tangy flavor. The fries were nice and crisp. As soon as I bit into the Big Jim, I thought how heavenly it was. The chicken was so tender and juicy. The combination of fried chicken , bacon, and gravy on a biscuit was fulfilling and scrumptious. The Big Jim was almost too big. I could barely finish it. My sister said her sandwich was fantastic and tasty. I would highly recommend this diner to anyone. My only beef with this place is it doesn't open until 5 pm.",

This is a must eat restaurant!",

It's the smallest diner I have ever been to,yet pleasant and clean. Even the outside tables and chairs were very clean. The young man who waited on us was friendly and helpful, and very cute, looks a bit like John Mayer. Anyway...the food is outstanding! I had a burger with mushrooms, cooked to my order. Came with the right amount of fries. The burger was delicious and plenty. My husband had the chicken sandwich, never had one so good. And for you single gals out there, the cook was as hot as the grill!  The cole slaw was different but very good. My husband ordered coffee and apple pie,the coffee was made fresh. The pie was a huge slice and worth trying..... YUMMO! The staff there was friendly,service was great. Welcome Diner is a must try.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying from the time I pulled up to the place, walked in the courtyard, stepped into the diner and took a seat on one of the 9 stools at the corner of the counter, I was a fan.  This tiny place packs a big punch.  The employees are super friendly and upbeat. There is a sense that they want you to have a great experience while you enjoy eating.   It's got some super items on the menu and they are working on creating a full bar.  They have large multi seat tables that look similar to picnic tables outside under umbrellas so there is more seating of the weather is good. There are several items on the menu I will return to try but on this particular trip, our first, we had the Holy Puerco & the Peanut butter Bacon Cheddar Burger.  Both were amazing.  I felt a bit like I was back in New Orleans with the fried cheddar grit cake, cracklins, & Crystal sauce.  Not to mention the burger reminds me of one of my favorite burger joints in NOLA, Yo Mama's Bar & Grill. They also have a Peanut butter Bacon burger.   I like the list they have on the wall behind the counter that names all the local businesses they purchase there produce, meat, and goods.  It shows the intent to buy local and support other local businesses.   I will be back, I witnesses the making and devouring of a sandwich named Big Jim, a fried chicken breast, country gravy, bacon & cheddar on a large homemade biscuit.  I have got to try that for myself.  So my recommendation to you is to go, eat, experience this little diner for yourselves.  There is soul in the food they serve.   Here is a link to the diner's website:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.marthaandmary.net%2Fwelcomediner%2Fwelcome.html&s=d9eac27417e43fbae0f7971900f240b7c25bf5d999ef5f7b9c47cb28ab916327\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">marthaandmary.net/welcom...</a>",

The future of diners is here, with its eclectic flavors that appeal to carnivores and vegans alike. You're going to find the dish for you here, I guarantee it.   There's a small trailer with indoor bar seating. Good luck getting in there, as the space is obviously limited. For everyone else, you're gonna walk up to a window and swiftly have your order placed. They take cash and credit, as long as you're not too much of a \"baller\" carrying above $20 bills. I think some RoRo newcomers might have trouble with that. ;-)   A little birdie on my shoulder told me to keep it simple and go with, well, the Little Birdie. With simply fried chicken and cheddar on a biscuit, it's great to test the waters and see how welcome really shines. My chicken was perfect! I would seem it took a little dip in buttermilk before being introduced to a tasty batter. I can really tell these cooks know their chicken. The biscuit was amazing as well--I'd go as far as to say it's the best I've had on this side of the Mississippi. My vegetarian dining companion went with the jackfruit fries. I'd only had the fruit once before, and I'm not an expert on preparation, but I will say it was definitely tasty and a great meat substitute.   Everything was washed down with a pint of PBR, but if you want something a little fancier, there are a few craft beers, and a generous cocktail list. For a very small price, I walked away happy and eager to return!",

I will admit that if it weren't for my boyfriend who decided after the first time that he loved it, I probably wouldn't have gone back.  Anyways - I'm a huge fan of their fries, first and foremost. I get them every time. They're the thinner shoestring variety & come with a different kind of delicious creamy dipping sauce, rather than just ketchup. You can get them topped with jackfruit, pulled pork, or poutine. With one of the toppings, it's basically the size of a meal.  I also really like the bumblebee sandwich. The fried chicken is one of the best and it tastes great on their biscuit with some honey!  My boyfriend swears by the jackfruit po'boy & for good reason. It's really a tasty vegetarian option, which is commonly difficult to find at most places. While he's not vegetarian, it's his go-to option, and the first time he had it, he said that it tasted very similar to pulled pork!  Also, if you're a fan of fish, try out the fish po'boy. The tarter sauce that comes on it is smooth & creamy and balances out the tart coleslaw. My favorite part about it is that it's much lighter than the fried chicken.  They open later on in the day and are open until 2am. It's our #1 choice for a late night bite!",

I had asked the boys to join me many many times at Welcome Diner and each time just poop pooped on the idea, but this time I had them both in the car and they were hungry, so down the street we went and before they knew it I had already parked near WD!    They went kicking and screaming as I lead them to the order line, I shoved menus in there hand and soon the fighting was subsiding, and before I knew it they were already giving their orders....  I went with the Koko. It's a biscuit sandwich that has fried chicken topped with chipotle ranch, arugula and tomato, I bet your thinking this must be a small sandwich, but you would be wrong, the biscuits are almost bun size, they are cut in half and grilled in the middle, they have the perfect texture of a biscuit and hold of a bun, oh and that fried chicken, oh sweet lord, this was a great sandwich!  One ordered the PB&B (Peanut Butter & Burger) it was crunchy peanut butter, B&B pickles, bacon, cheddar on a burger, dude this was delish as well, don't think about it, just order it and try it out, I promise you wont be disappointed.  The other ordered Mac & Cheese, and well I can not personally testify for it I can say it was a hit, before I knew it, the bowl was empty and the kid had a smile.  We also ordered 2 orders of Beignets drizzled in local honey and powder sugar, 2 orders split among 3 gave each of us 2 perfectly fried pieces of dough heaven. This was the perfect way to end a great meal!  The boys are already hitting me up wanting to go again, since it's their area I'm sure we will be back before you know it!",

First, it's super confusing that for outdoor seating you seat yourself and order at the window but indoor seating (but not at the bar inside) is served by a waitress. Not too bad if you've been there before but for newbies they should do a better job of communicating how it works. Because of this confusion, I stood in line at the window for ~10 minutes while an older couple fumbled through ordering and then tried to sit inside. Did not help that the staff member running this window was probably high. Whatever. On to food. Everything we had was pretty excellently made and tasty. However, we ordered the omelette and added sausage (per the menu) but the sausage came on the side??? Very weird. And the portion sizes were weird - we ordered a side of bacon for $3.50 which came with 2 strips. Seems pricey to me. And Brussels sprouts was like a half full bowl that looked like someone had already started chowing down. Finally, getting a refill on our tiny cups of coffee was an unnecessary burden that I feel like every other brunch place has a handle on.",

I normally love salty food but I couldn't eat this. It also made me sick to my stomach. Giving it stars because my boyfriend loves to eat here goes at least twice a month. So maybe I picked the wrong menu item, but in my opinion everything should be quality. Additionally the price was $11! No sides or anything, just a biscuit with chicken and a chipotle ranch with a tomato and some greens on it. I will most likely give it another try and will update my review if it improves.",

That's a little light for burgers.  Told the waiter while waiting for my meal.  He said we can make it a double burger.  I didn't know that this was an option, but didn't upgrade since the first patty was on the grill cooking already.  The fries came back crispy as ordered.  Ordered some dipping mayo for the fries.  I went back to my Airbnb and spoke to my host about the Welcome Diner.  They have lived in Phoenix for several years and never heard of it!  Just goes to show you, most people don't know what's in their backyards!",

My favorite is the PB&J burger, it's not something I would normally order but sometimes you have to take chances on food.   If you are looking to sit inside the tiny trailer that only fits about 10 make sure to get there when they first open. The place gets really packed, but there is additional seating outside. If you a first timer I would recommend sitting inside because the staff is great along with their drinks.",

I don't think I liked the jalapeno relish much since it had a burnt taste and more of a lemon taste instead of a jalapeno taste. I feel like I was lied to by the lady at the window when I was ordering when it came to what was in the jalapeno relish. The mac and cheese seemed to be missing one of it's key ingredients, cheese. It had some type of cheese sauce instead of actual cheese melted into it. I did not like it at all. It wasn't even heated up, it was straight up cold. I felt like I wasted my money here. Don't think I'll be coming back unless it's to drink some alcohol. I'll give it 2 stars for the outdoor seating and heaters but the food deserves zero stars. My girl wanted to try the poutine but wasn't able to cause they only make gravy with saugage in it and she doesn't eat pork. We both had the mac and cheese and let's just say her review would have been harsher than mine. Go somewhere else if you're hungry.",

We tried one of the chicken biscuit sandwiches recommended to us with the gravy on the side. The chicken was cooked perfectly and was so good. The gravy had awesome flavor, but the bacon was ok it was too tough which made it hard to eat with the sandwich. The burger had jalapenos and it was one of the best burgers we've had.

    "text": "Welcome Diner is apparently pretty famous around downtown, but I hadn't heard of it until my friends dragged me here on a weekend night around 11pm. I think the open from dinner until 2am is a great concept (especially with its proximity to ASU and UA), and I find the menu options interesting. The open seating is fine, but it gets really full really fast. The service was friendly, and parking is street.   Hibiscus lemonade: Gorgeous color and amazing tartness. This was super refreshing and not too sweet, which I appreciated. If it were me, I'd have loved a slight more floral flavor from the hibiscus, but I'd have this any hot, sweltering, typical Phoenix summer day.  Macaroni and cheese: The \"secret blend\" looked like a mixture of pale cheeses to me, and the cheesiness was mediocre. I thought the top was toasty and had that nice cheesy crust with the breadcrumbs, but the overall dish just erred on the side of under salted to me.   Pulled \"pork\" fries made with jackfruit and cabbage slaw: These pulled pork fries were pretty good! The sauce was tangy and rich, and I thought the texture was pretty similar to slightly dry pork. It's definitely an interesting alternative to meat, and when paired with the tangy slaw, the combination definitely had a nice kick. The fries were fine, mostly just a starchy vessel for the other ingredients.  Cornbread with butter: This was unfortunately pretty disappointing. The cornbread was served in a cute cast iron pan, but it was definitely over cooked and bone dry. I could taste some of the caramely corn flavor, but it was stuck on the bottom of the pan and a pain to get off. The butter was also light in flavor, and I couldn't really distinguish what it was flavored with. Overall a miss for me.  I might stop by Welcome Diner again for some late night munchies, but I might try other dishes next time. Maybe the shrimp toast?",

The service was poor, our server/cooks forgot our order so we were given complimentary over cooked fries that were dry and cold, and then everything came out crappy. Finally, after an hour, our peanut butter burgers instead of medium, came out well done, the grilled cheese had tomatoes (which we said no thank you to) and the poutine had fries that tasted like they were a week old! My brother in law couldn't even eat them.   I've been to this restaurant in the past, when they were a dive on Roosevelt, when they first opened up on Pierce. But, I can honestly say there are much better venues downtown to choose from. I'm so sad write that this was an awful experience. At this time, I would no longer recommend one of my long time favorite restaurants. How embarrassing that I brought my sister here to wrap up her birthday night.  I'm heartbroken.",

The Paloma cocktail was so good! I love tequila and grapefruit so it was a great combination. I ordered the big Jim for my meal. It was a biscuit with fried chicken, gravy and cheddar aka heart attack on a plate but so well worth it.

The fresh corn and arugula cut the grease from the tomatoes and balanced the meal.  The jackfruit BBQ fries were \"meaty\". Tangy and a good portion The only tiny suggestion was that there was too much slaw on the fries, as it made the dish too sour.  A great place in the outskirts of downtown.",

Our server was friendly, prompt and very knowledgeable. Started with an old fashioned. I'm usually not a fan of the muddled fruit type of old fashioned but this one was very tasty. The doctors orders was my second drink which was much less boozy but also very tasty.  As anticipated the food was fantastic! We started with the cornbread which was different from most cornbread I've had but great. I had the chorizo meatloaf at the recommendation of our server and it was so super delicious. The SO had the shrimp po' boy special which was also really good (especially the sauce). I have to admit though, my favorite bite of the evening was the pie. I don't remember exactly what it was called, but it included all of the delicious ingredients. It was something like salted bourbon carmel pecan pie with chocolate chips. It was so good we got another piece to go. No wonder this place has turned into a Phoenix staple. We will definitely be back!",

Very interesting vibe in the restaurant, you get 1970s feels mixed with diner/home cooking vibes so Definitely somewhere to check out for late night drinks and eats.",

He added bacon to the mac so I didn't try it...he said it was \"powdery\" and the bacon could have been crisper. I had the Fried green tomatoe sandwich but considering I just came from South Carolina I may be a little bias....but there were good well seasoned the bread was so good however some component of the sandwich causes the bottom bun to be wet...which made it kinda messy. Also the sandwich came with watermelon and there were 3 little pieces...so we added fries on the side. The fries where the then hand cut ones so still has skin on them which I love! All in all it was good and I would love to try some of the other options!!",

We ordered the pulled pork biscuit and the fried chicken biscuit with honey and pickles, Poutine, and beignets. The hurricane(house made fruit punch) was delish! The biscuits are huge, fresh, and the perfect compliment to the fried chicken and pulled pork! The Poutine had the right amount of gravy and cheese and a very nice portion. The beignets were hot, moist, crisp and a great end to the meal. We are looking forward to going back and trying more awesome food, including the burgers that looked very tasty!",

    "text": "I can't say enough great things about Welcome Diner.  It has my type of feel. I've been a few times and I love bringing guests from out of town here. The counter service outside is outstanding. The guy, I forgot his name, generally works the window and is patient and helpful. He's cool. Like the hip friend that knows about good and drink and can guide you around a really fun menu to get you what you want.  Went with the peanut butter burger, one of the fried chicken biscuit plates and a jackfruit French fry dish that just murdered my expectations.  There's a cool inside spot but it's always full when I get there. I have sitting inside at welcome on my bucket list. The bartender is always entertaining a fun crowd.  Keep opening up fun places and turning around Phoenixs food culture!",

A friend and I shared the fried green tomato sandwich and the grilled cheese. Both were outstanding, but I'd have to say the tomato was the standout. The sourdough bread they were served on was a treat in itself. We finished up with the beignets with local honey and powdered sugar which were also insanely delicious. A little different than what I've had in New Orleans, but c'mon, deep fried dough and sugar. You can't go wrong. The honey gave it kind of an Arizona twist. The staff was really friendly and came by twice to ask us how our food was. I'll definitely be back!! Gotta have some biscuits next time.",

Just had the PB&B burger with real deal THICK cut bacon, bread and butter pickles and my favorite chunky peanut butter. Cooked to perfection and delivered promptly, it went down quick with an ice cold PBR. Before dinner I had their version of Sazerac, made with a rye whiskey in lieu of cognac. Delish. Probably my new favorite summer whiskey drink! Also to die for is the bumblebee, imagine an amazing chicken sandwich on a top notch biscuit drizzled with honey. Yum! I'm full as I write this waiting on beignets that were comped because our side of fries didn't make it out, but I could eat a bumblebee because it's that good. So great food, great drinks and a great al fresco dining experience make Welcome Diner one of my favorite spots in Phoenix. If you come at night sit at the big round table on the 10th street side for great views of downtown.",

It doesn't bode the largest establishment around, and if you show up at the wrong time you might be sitting outside in the sun in anticipation.   I have been to this place several times and have not been disappointed once. I would suggest something for you to try, but I can't decide on any specific thing that is better than the other. The cup of sweet toast is a must try. My face literally melted off in delight. The burgers and fresh-cut fries are in my personal epic category. The egg sandwich is ridiculous. Really the only knock to this place is it's size. If I didn't need a crowbar to get myself out of the building each time I go, then it might be better.   Seriously people, go here. Eat here.

Except the food inspector was there. Normally this is a non-issue but in a diner car that serves 9 you hear and see everything.   We ordered 2 doubles and 1 fry and a bottle of coke. One burger was made incorrectly as they added grilled onions to both. I was feeling generous and did not ask for a new one. (I should have though, I do not care for onions on the burger) The fry's were good, in fact I could have eaten another order.   The cook Andy and the waitress were so frazzled by the inspector they kept forgetting things like opening the bottle of coke, ketchup, other peoples meals, the \"regular\" got a double when he ordered 2 singles and made sure Andy knew it was 2 singles...  The other \"regular\" looked as if she rolled out of bed, smoked a J, slapped her over sized headphones and Ipod in her PJ pocket and rode her bike here. She totally dumped her bike in the front, like she owned the place. Andy asked several times for her to move it but pot head didn't get it.   Andy asked the other regular to do something for him discreetly since the city guy was there, not sure what but he was outside for a while.

    "text": "The Welcome Diner was a difficult place to write a review about and you'll see why in a second. In order to capture my whole experience here, I'll interview myself (not at great detail or this post will be too long). Here it goes: WHAT DID YOU THINK ABOUT THE APPEARANCE OF THIS PLACE? When we pulled up to the restaurant at 9:00pm on Tuesday night, I was somewhat perplexed. There were about 20 people in the \"patio,\" which was comprised of various picnic tables, patio furniture, and what appeared to be a bar table that sat atop the fence that enclosed half the perimeter of the dining area. There was an eclectic mix of people. I noticed people of all ages and walks of life. Included in the mixture were some nurses, kids that looked like they were on probation (one of which was spitting tobacco), and one guy who kept alluding to his belief that he made his living doing stand-up comedy. As I started parking my rental car, I noticed this place is in the middle of a somewhat shady neighborhood. Not too comforting when I had to park a block away and walk past a house with a man smoking some substance on his porch. HOW WAS THE FOOD? The food was awesome! We ordered the Fish Po' Boy, the mac and cheese with chorizo, and the beignets. The sandwich was perfect. The whitefish was grilled nicely and the slaw was great. The mac and cheese was fantastic. I couldn't stop eating it. And the beignets? Those were a good end to a delicious meal. WOULD YOU GO BACK? Well, given the nature of the location and layout of the restaurant, I would typically say no. But the food was so good, I am interested in trying everything else on the menu. I guarantee we will come back. Specifically to try the poutine fries and the Champion burger. And the biscuit sandwiches. And sausage gravy. I would ask more questions of myself but I think I'd end up writing too much about food on the menu I didn't get an opportunity to eat...",

Maybe the mustard-based sauce is more common in SC. Hamburger and lemon meringue pie were yummy. All around pretty good.",

The staff was friendly and the waiter, Marcus, was very informative about the menu. He recommended the burgers/sandwiches but since it was late was looking for a something a bit lighter so I ended up getting the jambalaya. My bf ordered the Big Jim which is a biscuit sandwich and he really enjoyed that. My jambalaya was ok, I was expecting something more runny. BUT what really blew me away and the reason I did 5 stars is their house made ginger beer!! SUPERB  I could sip on this all day. Next time, I will try their hamburger/sandwich since that's what they are more know for and skip the jambalaya. That ginger beer tho  can't wait for next time!",

Pair that with my favorite beer from the brewery I used to live next to in Tucson (Dragoon)? Win win and win. Anyway back to the Big Jim, it was really good, especially considering my sobriety level, the gravy and chicken was just what I needed to carry on last night. The wife to be got herself a Bumble Bee which she deemed quite delicious. You'll have to take her word on that, as I was not able to procure any samples for my taste laboratory.

It was excellent. I would highly recommend.   I've also been to their sister location, welcome chicken + donuts. I have to say I enjoy their fare here much more.   The location has odd hours, 5pm-2am and is strictly outside patio seating on a sandy yard in the arts suburbs in downtown Phoenix. It's got an incredibly hipster vibe to it which may or may not be your cup of tea. The friend I was with described it as \"A bunch of stoners setting up shop in a run down house making really good food\". His assessment may or may not reflect my own.   I wouldn't go before 9pm personally unless the temp is under 90 degrees because of the seating and how heavy the food is. But this is definitely one of the best fried chicken and biscuits I've had in Phoenix so I definitely recommend checking this place out when the weather is nice.",

    "text": "Visited Welcome Diner last week during their happy hour and got a few dishes and a couple of drinks. My wife got the fried chicken sandwich and I got the pulled pork fries. Chicken sandwich was really good. Nice texture on the piece of fried chicken and a really fully biscuit. Great job on this sandwich guys. Add a little bit of Crystal hot sauce and that makes it even better. Pulled pork fries were good. The fries are smothered in pulled pork and then dressed with some kind of mustard based sauce which gives it a really nice tang. I think the fries could have been a little more crispy since they have to hold up to so much stuff. Also, the coleslaw on the fries give it an extra layer of texture. I wasn't too crazy about the old fashioned. It was way to sweet for me. Other then that, great food and I will return for that chicken sandwich especially.",

It was super refreshing sitting outside in the air sipping a Paloma (grapefruit jarritos combined with tequila and some sort of juice) and munching on a side of fries.  Some of the other people in my group got biscuits, which looked incredible.  We hung out until closing-time, at which point a waiter wandered out to give us a few \"hey, closing soon\" friendly reminders.  We told him he should probably change the sign to \"UNwelcome diner\" at closing time every night.  He decided \"nah man, that's not our vibe.\"  Too funny.  Love the service.  This is definitely going to be one of my late-night post-shift haunts.",

    "text": "The Koko Biscuit deserves an award. Whenever we're out in Phoenix, we always have to drop by for a bite.  Many reasons make this place so great and always packed. 1. Their food. They don't serve anything here that isn't noteworthy. They just GET IT. Comfort food with a modern twist and yummy drinks. I'm always in. 2. The atmosphere is very welcoming and homey. Definitely embodies the \"Welcome\" part in their name. Their dining area inside is tiny. Basically a bar top and that's it. Most of the seating is outdoors, but they made it a cozy spot with the decor. This is quite a nice social/dining spot. 3. The staff is very friendly and helpful. They're very casual as if they're your friends lol. Again, treating you welcomingly with none of that extra restaurant server etiquette.  4. THE KOKO BISCUIT ALONE  Just come. If you're in the area, you might as well. I really wish we had one of these in LA.",

It is a great veggie option if you are craving for something deep fried but not oily. I really like the combination of crispy batting on the outside with juice fresh green tomato inside.  I sat on the open kitchen area and oh boy, such temptation to order more dishes as I look at the mouthwatering breakfast plates they are preparing. The chicken, biscuit and gravy looked really good.

I'm glad that they have more room to serve everyone in the a/c, but the car was half the reason I wanted to visit again.   My boyfriend loved that they had jackfruit. Getting to eat something that isn't some pretend meat was great for him. His sandwich was kind of spicy and tangy from the slaw. Very tasty.  I had the Bumble Bee and... meh. I would have preferred it be open faced. Just slice a biscuit in half, smear mustard on it, drizzle honey, top with chicken, little more honey, and pickles. It'll take up more of the plate and trick me into thinking I got my money's worth. Served as is, I didn't get nearly enough honey. This whole thing ends up being fairly dry.",

Tried the \"painkiller\" a fancy Pina Colada, it was yummy and a mimosa.   For food: I opted for the \"Sunrise Sando\" gluten free- over a bed of arugula with a over medium fried egg, and breakfast sausage.  My husband had the \" big Jim\" fried chicken Sando.  It was loaded with gravy and looked delicious. Both dishes served with a small  side of watermelon.   Reason for 4 stars, no gluten free items or menu items indicated as such.   Wanted to get a piece of blueberry pie to go, but they were out.   Glad we checked the place out. Loved the decor and mixed matched picnic tables and chairs outside. Loved the plant stands and vintage vibe throughout.",

The gravy was just okay, there wasn't enough of it. The chicken was seemed like it was prepared ahead of time. I get that fried chicken is hard but made to order is always best. We also order the Mac and cheese. I appreciated that it wasn't too cheesy or overly rich. But something was funky with the taste. My companion had a totally different take on the food though.

A ton of seating is available in their outside patio, otherwise there are some booths and bar seating inside as well. I did not like how closely some of the booths were lined up though; the very drunk, ratchet girl sitting directly behind me basically kept whipping her long blonde hair at me. :/   Other than that, comfort food seemed to make up most of the menu, some more Vegan friendly. We opted for a version each of their biscuit sandwiches. I had the *Koko Biscuit* which included more lighter ingredients than the *Big Jim* biscuit. The former had arugula and tomatoes along with their very crunchy and juicy fried chicken. The helping of sauce was a chipotle ranch which offered a nice kick to the meal. Biscuit we both felt could have been more fluffy and perhaps milkier in texture; these were a bit too crumbly. I did like the helping of watermelon on the side as a sweet finish to a very hearty meal.   I'm a sucker for cornbread so I did also order the *Heirloom Cornbread*. I immediately could taste how Vegan friendly this was; it definitely was missing butter, so the texture was a bit more airy and ultimately dried out. On that note, the butter offered on the side was a sweet addition (literally). I think it was an apple butter of some sort.  An eclectic menu and I did love how they sourced their ingredients from local businesses and farms. A worthy spot to visit while in Phoenix!",

First they not only have a chicken biscuit, but it is smothered and covered in a creamy sausage gravy. Can you say I'll take several? This meal definitely requires fork and knife and maybe even a partner to share it with. Although the chicken was covered in gravy, it still remained a bit crispy and was definitely juicy. I saw grits on the menu and also decided I needed those. They are made with pimento cheese. OMG. They were cheesy and creamy, everything grits should be. They come in a small cup but if they offered a large bowl I would gladly choose that size as they were pretty tasty. Besides the delicious food the employees were friendly and the neighborhood is pretty hip. There is street parking and plenty of it which is always nice.",

Was checked on by numerous individuals throughout our meal.  Each had a smile on their face and just seemed to be genuinely happy people who were content to be at work.  I appreciated that the wait staff were just being themselves, and were not being fake nice in order to receive a better tip.  Authenticity is underrated.  The food:  Fantastic.  Great execution with high quality ingredients. We arrived for brunch.  I had a \"Bumblebee\" (fried chicken, honey, biscuit) and country potatoes, which were both perfect.  My wife had the \"Big Jim\", which was fried chicken, cheddar, bacon, and sausage gravy on a biscuit.  I'm not sure if I heard her say two words after her food was delivered - she was concentrating intently on the culinary work of art before her.  My son had the Biscuit Eggs Benedict and loved it as well.  Price was a little high.  Over $40, tip and taxes not included, for some potatoes and three breakfast sandwiches is high.  It WAS certainly worth the money though, and we plan to return when we visit the area again this winter.  Highly recommended.",

    "text": "When it comes to service, atmosphere, and menu breadth, Welcome Diner is tough to beat and I totally get their Yelpy popularity. Those three things alone bring Welcome Diner firmly into four star territory in my book, but my biscuit sandwich was a tad bit disappointing to the point where I'm shying away from the full gravity of the hype surrounding this place.  Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Welcome Diner crushes I when it comes to their service and atmosphere. This is a step right into the past but with some refreshing progressive flair that's executed upon by genuinely kind and caring folks. I had a full fledged conversation with my server and bartender that was memorable even though I'd spent the rainy evening restaurant hopping all over DTPHX. Star.       Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  $10.00 is a logical price point for a premium biscuit sandwich, and that's exactly what I paid for a rather large Bumblebee sandwich. Star.      Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  This bumblebee sandwich was good, but it didn't blow me away for a few reasons. For starters, my bar for biscuit sandwiches has been placed impossibly high thanks to Pine State Biscuits in Portland, Denver Biscuit Company, and Biscuit Bitch in Seattle.  While my biscuit here at Welcome Diner was fine, I wouldn't have been impressed with it if I were eating it by itself, but such is life when you're creating (slightly overcooked) biscuits to serve the purpose of sandwiching an sandwich. From there, the cut of chicken was fine and the honey and mustard a nice touch, but there was simply something missing here the kept this from being a truly A-Class sandwich. Single Star.      Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Imperfect biscuit aside, Welcome Diner is fantastic and is worthy of your visit in Phoenix. Star.",

Service was on point!   Loved the retro look inside of the diner. Ample seating available with a pet friendly patio. If you sit outside orders are placed at the walk-up window and a server brings out the food to you.   I wish we hadn't had breakfast before bc the plates looked delicious. We did have some non alcoholic drinks which were very refreshing. The lemonade was our favorite. The fruit bowl was a good size for $5 but they were all out of strawberries. I would've like to have some pineapple in the mix but fruit is fruit and I ate it all.   Cute spot. I def want to try the food!",

    "text": "Welcome Diner has been on my to-eat list for awhile. I've heard good things about it, but never really had an opportunity to drop in for a meal or drinks. My boyfriend used to live literally down the street from the original and current location, so the menu is imprinted on his mind. Nothing has changed since then with the exception of a few new additions.   I. Love. This. Neighborhood. It is totally reminiscent of my old stomping grounds in hipster downtown Indy - I could see myself living in this Phoenix hood. Welcome Diner fits in with the area. It wasn't terribly busy the evening he took me there so we were able to grab seats at our choosing. The girl taking window orders was so sweet when he mentioned I'd never been- she shook my hand, introduced herself gave and a warm welcome.   He has told me over and again about how awesome the house hurricanes are so we each got one... and second for myself! I figured the jackfruit sandwich would be sufficient for a meal, but it wasn't. I feel if you're paying $10 for a sandwich, there should be more meat & slaw than bread and be dripping in sauce (or some extra on the side). But it wasn't. The flavor was there but the portion size wasn't. So we got poutine which made up for the lacking sandwich. His chorizo meatloaf was delicious.   Hopefully another we'll have another dinner date there in the future, those hurricanes have me hooked!",

Would definitely go back and order the Jackfruit Po'Boy next.  Thanks Welcome Diner for having vegan friendly options.",

Went with the kid trying to try new spots. First, and foremost the menu is specific  and limited. Had I ordered a simple burger or something, I may have given them a 2, as they seemed to know what they were doing back there when It comes to hamburgers. Perhaps , that's what they should just stick to.. burgers. Ya know , having a limited and specific menu isnt bad. It gives you just enough room to make food your amazing at making. My son ordered a burger and fries... no complaints.   I ordered some type of strange soup.... its wasnt a soup...at all! It was more like a bowl of...stuff with over cooked rice. It tasted like gravy! ( seriously)   My old fashion, wasnt.   We sat out side at first.... and we were attacked by flies. The whole outside is a bug/ fly haven, it was gross. went inside, and flies were just buzzing around with no cares or worries in the world. That napkin and fork in the pic...is covering my drink from the flies!  I would like to suggest the employees all dress in at least the same shirt. One waitress had gym attire, the other a black tee , looked like he just rolled out of bed.   I wouldn't return, unless it was 12 am and i wanted a burger..and fries.",

    "text": "The food is very good.  Southern style with an island influence.  Yes, that sounds wierd; try the Jackfruit fries and you will see what I mean.  The plate is fries and very spicy Jackfruit drizzled in a Carolina mustard style BBQ sauce. We had biscuits and gravy and Jambalaya.  Both were very good.  The cook likes things on the spicy side and that's fine with me. The venue is also open until 2 AM - one of the few places to eat downtown after about 9 most nights. I am deducting one star for the house management.  Inside seating is very limited.  There are about 8 tables and 8 barstools.  They have outside seating with window service...no outside wait staff.  On a hot night, you want to be inside.  The problem, from my point of view, is that the management let's patrons linger - for hours.  In a less crowded restaurant, I enjoy the opportunity to take my time and eat my meal.  It is nice to not have the staff trying to turn the table as quickly as possible.  It does not work here.  We watched and waited while groups sat at the tables long after their meals had concluded and just talked.  The host said, \"People like to just sit in the A/C so they don't have to go outside.\" Fair enough. I will go back but, if I can't get an inside seat, I won't wait around.  A simple policy like, you have to order food to sit inside would go a long way to relieve the situation and would make the place more profitable too.",

The staff were very friendly and we all enjoyed watching their team get the food out of that tiny kitchen. We were made to feel very welcome and in speaking to the staff it was obvious that they had great pride in the restaurant. They passed along some history on the building, formerly from Winslow. We loved the fact that we were sitting in a piece of genuine Americana.   Ordered the andouille corn dogs and pulled pork topped fries for a starter, they were great! The Mac n cheese, burgers and chicken biscuit that followed were also excellent. We washed them down with pumpkin porters and bottled cokes. And the beignets we were served for dessert were equally delicious.   Bottom line. We left stuffed and happy. A very memorable meal produced by a great team. We will be back.",

I also had a perfectly cooked burger that was so juicy. The staff are equally quirky  and cool as the menu as I found myself dancing in my seat at the bar.  I will definitely be back and I am so mad I've been here so long and never knew this amazingness was here",

The fries were a touch too salty with the mustard based BBQ and vinegar slaw. John got a Big Jim with was a huge biscuit with fries chicken, bacon, and covered in a yummy peppered sausage gravy. We also got sausage gravy and biscuits. For dessert we got beignets. Foods not perfect but VERY freshly prepared and pretty darn yummy!  This place is definitely worth a visit!",

Here are the 2 things you need to change:  1) Open earlier than 5 2) Sell glasses of wine instead of just bottles  Other than that, it's always an enjoyable experience. The drinks are good. The hurricane is a sweet and refreshing cocktail, but my favorite is the floricita. I imagine the whiskey-based drinks are just as delicious.  For the food - the biscuit plates are always good, but it's sometimes hard to get myself in the mood for a biscuit plate. When there were rillettes on the menu I was a happy camper - the fat melts on your tongue and the pickled watermelon was the perfect yang to that yin. I have eaten a lot of rillettes and you guys do them well. I would personally like to see more entrees on the menu, and since you serve breakfast, open for breakfast? Or at least lunch... It's the perfect day spot.  Nevertheless, the food is amazing. Great job in the kitchen. Drinks are awesome. Prices great. Fun and social atmosphere, and good walkable location.",

    "text": "Welcome Diner in its latest incarnation is a gem. Their new hours make them far more accessible for dinner service, but you'll still want to plan on showing up relatively late, at least during the summer, as most of their seating is outside.  The food here is the star, but the workers and cooks are all having a great time, really genuine and fun, and overall make the experience even better.   The Port of Call burger is exactly what you want: perfectly cooked, coated in cheese and onions and whatever else, and the type of meal that will leave you just barely too full.  The fried chicken sandwich is a thing of beauty, if you can unhinge your jaw to take it on. Get it with melted cheese, and go even further by tacking on gravy and bacon, if you think your heart can handle it.  The fries are fantastic as well. It's a bit pricey, but the quality of ingredients loads the food with flavor and makes it well worth it. They also have some amazing specials, and: their biscuits. Their biscuits are a thing of beauty, either with honey on them, or as part of the chicken sandwiches; they're simply perfect.  They're just a hop-skip off the 7th St. I-10 exit, and well worth trying out.",

Nice burger cooked a perfect medium rare. So glad they went with chunky PB, and loads of it  We split the Welcome fries topped with Kiltlifter braised pulled pork and housemade Carolina BBQ sauce. Was exactly what you'd expect, nothing fancy, but really tasty  The only miss was the Fried Avacado. Plain and flavorless, really just a vehicle for a nice dipping sauce. Now, if they did a fried chunky spicy onion heavy guacamole, they might have something  Also have been in for brunch, and the Holy Puerco is amazing",

Driving through the downtown neighborhood to get here is kinda sketchy in the middle of not so decent area. So don't be scared your going the right way haha  Walking up to the Welcome diner it was so sweet how it's all set up! You can sit inside but only if there's room, it a bar top for 3 people. However, outside is where the fun is, the hanging lights, the awesome community tables are everywhere. The menu is short and to the point. I ordered the fried green tomato sandwich and the Sunrise. The fried green sandwich was a little hit to bite for the first few minutes but wow, how amazing it was! The sunrise was so delicious  with the chorizo, I will have to try the other choices next time. To wash it down I got the house made ginger beer which was so refreshing I wanted more!  If you come here and don't mind waiting for a few extra long minutes for your food it won't disappoint!",

We have tried lots of things on their menu: all of their biscuits and gravy. The Big Jim with fried chicken is my favorite. ALWAYS add a fried egg. Burgers. Poutine. The shredded pork fries and jackfruit meat vegan fries. We've tried a number of their specials. I ALWAYS get an order of their brussel sprouts. Beignets. I have never ever been disappointed here.

My veggie burger was bitter because it was burned on one side and I asked them, \"is it normal burning bitter like this?\" They said YES. (Only one side?? ). Really? I had better veggie burger even at Fat burger or even at Na mi.  The flavor was nice actually on the first bite before I bite the burned side :(. I am little bit disappointed.  The prices for 2 burgers (veggie and peanut butter burger) and 1 lemon pie homemade (with over-dozed sugar flavor in one side and strong lemon taste at the center) total $20-ish.  Peanut butter burger was good especially for them who love peanut butter in their burger.",

I used to drive all over the valley depending on what mood I was in, and now I pretty much just go to the Welcome Diner. They have about 9 seats inside and quite a bit of patio seating. They have a few nice big outdoor heaters too.  Some things I love  -Excellent quality food sourced from local vendors -Amazing amazing drinks. They make their own bitters, grenadine, squeeze their own lime juice  and even have fresh herbs to put in. Each one I've seen made is with love. -Good service, fun atmosphere -Almost everything is made from scratch -Specials that are (always delicious) experiments, not leftovers. -Catfish Fridays (Try the sampler!)  I would say price wise it's not necessarily cheap, but not expensive. Average plate will run you about $10, but considering the quality and atmosphere I have no problem paying it!   Favorite dishes- PB&B burger Bacon Blue burger Veggie Stallion (housemade edamame and mushroom veggie burger with housemade ricotta) Red beans and rice with sausage Grilled cheese on a housemade biscuit. Try the holy puerco!",

The first thing to know is the inside seating is limited to the bar, maybe 6 seats.  You order outside and sit at patio tables.   The staff is super friendly.   The drinks are great.   Everything is expensive.  We ordered 2 hurricanes, poutine, brussel sprouts & mac & cheese appetizers  $42.00 plus feeding the tip jar.  The drinks were fantastic.  There was nothing good about the poutine; super skinny fries with 2 slices of cheddar cheese and a heap of lukewarm, flavorless,  really heavy sausage gravy.   Brussel sprouts were ok; roasted with what seemed like no seasoning.  Mac & cheese was a heavy glob without a lot of flavor.  Best advice, stick to the drinks.",

The drinks and the rest of the experience with the staff and the manager was enough for me to got to jail if I didn't have enough control not to hit them.  The old fashion was one of the worst I've ever had. I took the drink back to the bar, the bartender ask me what was wrong? I told him a old fashion shouldn't be red, to much bitters and to many mashed up cherries. He I formed me that's how he makes them. Ok great but it tased awful, he did pour me a straight bourbon, that wasn't to hard to make. At this point I was annoyed. Then the waiter told us our outside drinks could be inside the white fence area, because it was a health code violation I was Irritating due to the limited selection of coke, products.  Was going to leave at this point asked for boxes to take food home at this point. Decided to Take the drinks to the car. Ten minutes later a cat jumps on to the table. I told the waiter that it happened his smart ass remark was he didn't see it. This was the point I lost it, went in ask for the manager. The manager was standing right there, but walked outside as I demanded to see him another employee went and got him. I met him outside and the waiter. At this point I was really pissed off and lost my temper. They told me that can't control the yard, but I have to remove my drink that's controlling the yard but the cat that jumps on to my dinner table isn't their problem. I'm a little confused about that. If it was a rat or a mouse or other bugs it be their problem to control.   I will be calling the health department on Monday and hopefully the owner or real manger of this restaurant will respond so we can talk about how unprofessional their staff was. I admit I lost my temper, but the waiter reply to the cat being on the table after talking to me about health code violation pissed me off.    Real irritating after sending $72.00 on a decent meal to have a bad experience with the staff.",

We finally had dinner here over the weekend and that's the last time I get excited over an eatery again. I ordered the Big Jim and my husband had the Grilled Cheese with extra bacon, we shared mac and cheese and \"poutine\". I had a beer and he had a Coke. The Big Jim was basically slop on a plate. I have never seen something that looked so messy and that was so difficult to eat! I tried to eat the thing and it just wasn't gonna happen. I didn't want to further embarrass myself and I was so over trying to eat it, that I decided to take it home. My husband's grilled cheese DIDN'T come with the extra bacon he ordered. Instead it was served to him on a little plate. Really? The \"poutine\"? Try sausage gravy over fries. Where were the cheese curds and the delicious light brown gravy?! No cheese of any sort. What a joke! Totally NOT poutine. Stars for the Mac and Cheese and beer because that was the only enjoyable thing in front of my face.  In closing - We spent around $60.00 on overpriced bland food. The tip is automatically added to your bill at check out which pissed me off. I'll tip what I WANT to tip, not what you're TELLING me to tip. Patrons also taxed for beer, non alcoholic beverage and food. Charge after charge on the receipt that's sent via text. I realize we all pay for it one way or another, but seeing all those little charges annoyed the crap out of. Especially because my food sucked.   What an underwhelming, expensive experience!",

    "text": "I have been wanting to check this place out for a while and was finally able to make it in.  It was a Saturday night and my friends and I were exploring Roosevelt Row when we decided to look for food. We came in around 1a and although it was closing soon, they took our order and said it would take an hour for the food to come out. We ordered drinks and sat down at one of the tables. There were 4 in my group so seating wasn't a problem. The table we sat at was more of a communal table. If we came earlier, I'm sure there'd be a few different groups sitting at our table. The weather is just cooling down so it was nice to actually sit outside and enjoy the fresh air. We were literally the last ones there as our food arrived. I ordered the fried green tomato sandwich and was very happy with my choice. The breading was crispy and the tomato itself kept it's shape. The chipotle ranch sauce complimented the flavors and the sourdough was toasted. I love trying different items so if I'm with a group, I sample a bit of everyone's plate. The poutine fries were very hearty. Even though it was smothered in gravy, the fries were crunchy and not soggy. I was also very impressed by the grilled cheese. On my next trip, this would be what I order.",

I drove down and stopped by. This place is really cool. I like the open setup outside. There's benches for you and your friends to chill on while u enjoy your meal.  There's a dinner car that seats about nine people that's cool to sit in.  The service is GREAT!!! All the people there are super cool. A very friendly atmosphere that anyone can enjoy. When your foods ready they always check to make sure everything's right before giving it to you.  Now.... The burgers and catfish sandwiches are AMAZING!!! I have had the welcome burger, the peanut butter burger and the Friday night catfish poor boy!!! All left smiles on my face wanting more. You have to try this place out!!! IT'S A DEFINITE MUST!!!",

My husband had the burger with bleu cheese and bacon, it was a bit overdone and the bun was burned but he's willing to give it another try.  Shared an order of Mac and cheese...definitely a winner with that recipe, it was delicious.  Ordered the beignets for dessert. They may have been the best I've ever had and that includes the originals from Cafe du Monde in New Orleans.  It's defiantly a young crowd and it gets busy but it was nice to just hang out and enjoy a beautiful warm night. The cocktail list is innovative and they know what they're doing.  Highly recommend.",

Also had a a homemade biscuit with honey and it was crazy good. Prob try a fried chicken biscuit sandwich next time.   Place has a lot of character. Old RV converted into a restaurant.

Even my partner, who orders his plain, ketchup only, raves about them. Unfortunately for the burgers, the fried chicken is even better. The Koko is to die for! Perfectly fried, crispy chicken with a perfectly spiced chipotle ranch, served on a biscuit with arugula and a tomato slice.  While the food is great, what really has me coming back is the home brewed ginger beer. It's spicy and biting but all around refreshing. So unique and flavorful!

The chicken was perfectly seasoned, the bread was toasty, the peppers and onions were super tasty, and the cheese sauce was on point. Everyone else loved their food as well, apparently the No Way Jose burger is a must order. I had a great cocktail as well to top everything else and 4 others split 2 bottles of wine. Line to get food and to be served was a little slow, but expected on a busier night. And if the prices were a tad cheaper I'd rate this place 5 stars.",

The employees were very helpful and patient with me taking my time to order, as you have to walk up to one window to do so, and there was a line. So I took a chance on their recommendation and tried the fake pulled pork sandwich. I never even had jackfruit before, so I knew even if it tasted bad it would be a new experience. Wrong again, it was amazing, the flavor the texture all on point. Just wow it almost makes me want to go back to eating pork to try the real one. I mean I've never tasted anything like this before.

Outdoors, it is easier to talk to all of the people in your group and when the weather is beautiful outside why not  :) I've only ordered the Big Jim and it's hard to venture away from a dish you already love! There's just something about fried chicken and gravy in-between 2 biscuits that make the perfect combination! The Poutine is delicious and there is definitely enough of it to share! My friends ordered the PB Burger, The Koko, and the No Way Jose which they were very thrilled about! Cocktails are wonderful as well!

    "text": "I hate to give this a bad review because i honestly was hoping to love this place. I was expecting to give it 5 stars along with the rest of the reviews.. But of course that wasnt the case. Its cute and small but great for spending time with friends. I love the fact that its open till 2am. The only issue i had is their food is not that good i felt. To start before i even got to order and was looking at the menu i had a friend with me that had takeout from another place. We were approached by a young lady named Christina who told him he couldnt bring in the food because of the liquor license and that he needed to \"get out\". I could understand a beverage from somewhere else but a liquor license has nothing to do with food. The thing was she had a bit of an attitude which really turned me off to not even order anymore, but i still did regardless because i wanted to try this place.  I ordered the poutine fries which i was really hoping to be good seeing all the pictures and reviews for it. Like everyone said the wait time for your food is truly ridiculous. I ordered my food take out only to watch others that came after me be served their take out.. All in all it took 56 minutes for french fries and a side of gravy.  For $9 french fries i expected them to be good.. maybe i came too late or on an off day for the cooks but i feel i could have honestly ate better fries at a McDonalds.. A young guy i believe to be the manager came out and apologized for the misunderstanding of Christina shooing us out. He let us know that she was confused on the liquor license that it was only for outside beverages not food. Props to him for being kind enough to do that. But on the other hand the employees should ask questions if they are unsure on something before jumping on someone. Its common respect for the employees and customers.  Would i be back? Unlikely.",

Service was great, the guy at the window introduced himself, welcomed us and then made some great recommendations both on and off the menu.  Food came out quickly and was delicious!  -PB&B Burger Med-rare was fantastic (tip: you can upgrade the side to poutine for $3(off menu))  -Big Jim was Very Good, gravy was great but the biscuit was a little dry. Still very good though. -Poutine was fantastic!! Hands down Fantastic!! -Mac & Cheese side was good, but I feel like it really could have been better. It was a very classic dish and didn't have the flair of the rest of their menu. -Ginger Beer is homemade and is VERY GOOD, strong, tart, good.  A few reasons for the missing star: 1 the chairs, I had to swap out a broken chair and then sat in another one that had a bent leg that almost broke before I traded it in too. 2 the dry biscuit on the Big Jim.",

    "text": "What a fun spot! Love the late night eats option. Inside the establishment you've got a True diner feel. Vibrant blue colored - cushion-y booths and a bar top that extends across the narrow restaurant. The courtyard area has plenty of seating for those that wish to enjoy the fresh air in our perfect fall/winter/spring weather.  We appreciated the menu spin - not the same old boring burger turkey sandwich kind of joint. Though our food was on the verge of being too salty (hoping this was just an off night), everything we tried was enjoyable. Both hubby and I got variations of the chicken biscuit sandos. The housemade biscuits were hearty, but not too dense. Loved having the watermelon on the side - a refreshing taste after the heavier meal items. The arugula and tomato on my sandwich added a nice freshness to the fried chicken. The hurricane was excellent - not too sweet with a balanced amount of tart. BUT the real stars of the show!? The fried chicken was fantastic - so tender and flavorful, I could immediately tell at first bite that it had been brined (server confirmed for at least 24 hours). The amount of breading was perfect - not dense and very light, crispy and you could see the herb flecks within the breading. A hearty portion too! AND the (housemade) pimento cheese - bomb! They need to sell this in a to-go case!!  We sat inside and the service was great - perfectly attentive!  We'll be back to try the pie and another one of the menu favorites.",

We were here last on June 29th this was a day when my husband was not fond of the service at the bar in the back left corner. They were told there is a wait to sit at the bar(so if there was not a whole lot of people occupying seats there was a supposed wait list you had to be on in order to sit there) where the drinks are made and then later on that night they were told there isn't a wait for the bar. It was super confusing. I've tried almost everything on the menu before they switched to a new location and raised their prices it feels like. A few friends of  mine and myself agreed  that their prices are not worth the food quality anymore. I used to love the gravy and yesterdayI  didn't even want to keep the leftovers. I tossed it as soon as I  got home. The no way Jose is my usual go to and I'm so disappointed I chose to try new things. Both things the shrimp toast and poutine didn't do it for me the other day. Stick to the burgers and regular fries. Trust me.",

A boxed car diner with outdoor picnic tables sitting in the middle of a residential neighborhood? Sign me up!   Welcome diner is the rare combination of good food, low prices, and perfect portion sizes. The fried green tomato sandwich is a must, while the Mac and cheese is among the best I've had. The torched crust takes the dish to a whole new place. The only knock on my one-man feast was the beignets, which were a little on the dense side(eats more like a cake).    To top it all off, they are open till 2am! Welcome diner, you have made a fan out of me.   Now does one want to sit outside in the Arizona heat? that's a separate issue altogether.....",

Great friendly service behind the small counter where you can see the cooking and the bartending happening. Or walk up outside and order and find your own table. Gotta try the Big Jim or the Bumblebee. Definitely will be back to try the Po'Boys and the poutine fries. Love that they are right down the road from us and I can go satisfy my southern cravings.   Beignets are 3 to an order and not Cafe DuMonde but the honey drizzle s fantastic! They have a liquor license and the drinks were pouring...street parking or across the street, there is a lot.",

    "text": "Was in Phoenix to meet up with some friends and we settled on this place for our Friday evening dinner plans.  Location & Aesthetics -- Located just on the corner of E Roosevelt & N 10th St. in Phoenix. Parking is limited to the street or in the small area behind the diner though I think the diner staff park there. Seating is mostly outdoors.  There is seating within the diner but it's small so if you're coming with a crowd, then I'd recommend dining outside.   There are string bulb lights outside with powerful misters, and large tables and chairs.  It is sandy outside so you may want to wear shoes versus flip flops.   Outside area was very clean and well kept.  Tables were clean as well. Noise level is nonexistent except for the passing vehicle or two from the street.    Service -- Staff are very friendly and helpful explaining items from the menu including drinks.  Upon arriving, you order at the little window at the side of the diner.  Provide then with your order, pay, then go sit.  Your drinks and food will be brought out to you.  Menu -- Lots of available menus right next to the order window - drinks and meal menus.  Menus were easy to understand with small descriptions of the dishes or drinks.    Food -- I had the Welcome burger which didn't disappoint.  Made to my liking as requested and to cooked to perfection, it was mouthwatering, flavorful, well seasoned, and juicy. I had a side of fries with fresh cut, cooked well, hot, and slightly drizzled with salt along with a chopped seasoning (don't know the name) on it but it certainly added extra flavor. For my drink, I order a couple of Hurricanes which also was made to perfection -- not too sweet and not too tart with accurate proportions of rum and other integral ingredients.  Overall, very happy with the place, staff and terrific food.  Will definitely recommend and would love to return to try their fried chicken with biscuits plus their poutine fries which I spied other folks eating!",

Everything is top notch and words can't describe this place; you just have to go!!  Sat down and talked with Michael (owner) about meat smoking, cooking and everything culinary. Great guy who knows his s*(&t. Overall, im very glad we were brought here and will be back in the near future!",

Got a lemonade (made with fresh lemon juice), the fried chicken with cheese biscuit sandwich and split an order of bacon cheddar fries. The chicken was perfectly cooked with a crispy outer breading, thick and juicy meat inside. The biscuit was really tasty and flaky. It came with a few cubes of watermelon but I don't like melon so those went untouched.  We sat inside at the bar and everyone working inside was super nice and friendly. They have quite a few regulars and I could see why. The prices were a bit higher than I expected but they use totally local sourced ingredients and everything is prepared fresh so you're paying for the quality just as much as the quantity.  An order of cheddar bacon fries, a biscuit chicken sandwich with watermelon side, lemonade, and tip totalled to just over $21.",

I also felt the drinks were weak or watered down for $10 a pop. I'll probably be back to try some other food, but it wasn't a home-run as I had hoped.",

Crispy and fluffy where it needed to be with a well balanced butteryness. To make things even better the biscuit did not fall apart after the first bite :). Loved the relaxed atmosphere and music selection outside. The dudes that were working were very courteous and answered questions without eye rolling like you may get at other downtown establishments.",

Just take a gander at the picture offered here on this page and tell me what would stop you from going there to eat an unbelievably delicious basket of fries and burger, each such perfectly seasoned to compliment one another, its as if this stuff was made from the craftsmanship of a gastronomic grill master.  The burger easily beats out even cult-status places like Delux or In n Out, and their handcut fries are subtly crunchy and salty.  Their salsa burger topping absolutely rocks the block.  And I don't know if their ketchup is made by the Magical Man from Happy Land who lives in a gumdrop house on Lollipop Lane, but something about it slaps a toothy grin on my head.  The picnic tables outside make you feel like you are doing something productive while you gorge yourself.  Like its okay to ingest a thousand calories as long as you are given the impression that you are on a hike or something.  But whatever.  Its all class.  My only beef (Heh.  Pardon the pun.)  is that Welcome Diner is closed on Sundays and that they force me to battle the tweakers at the 7th and Roosevelt Circle K as I spring for a pack of P-funks and a $20 bill due to their 'no cards' policy.  It would also be in my best interest if they started serving micro-brews from Oregon or Happy Land.  That would be right good.",

It's a small and intimate little place so expect to have some cool conversations with other patrons.   Be prepared with cash and a sweatband (or five!). In the summer heat, it's a bit hot in there, but everyone looks a little sexier with a bead or two of sweat on their forehead, no?   I got a grilled cheese (made with lettuce, tomato & bread n butter pickles) and fresh cut fries that are to die for. Way better than In N' Out's just so you know. And the chocolate chip cookie. Oh how its nutmeg danced on my taste buds! I liked it. A lot a lot.  They get everything they can from local & organic growers, have phenomenally yummilicious bread and even Mexican Coca-Cola. Hooray for real sugar cane! Too bad I realized this after I ordered a diet coke. I'll splurge on some calories if it means I get to drink from a glass bottle any day.  I'm so glad my friend showed me this place. It is a definite gem and I will definitely be back. When it cools down, I may even bring the pooch along and sit outside near the kiddie pool. Fun!

It's right on the corner of 10th Street & Roosevelt in a cute little red and white dining car.  There are a few parking spaces behind the diner on 10th Street.  I would check the hours, as I think I was told differently than the hours posted in the other review.  My friend and I went to the diner on a Saturday afternoon and were able to get seats inside at the tiny counter.  I'm sure as it gets warmer, those will be harder to come by and that when the weather is nice, most people sit outside.  It is indeed a tiny space on the inside and half the seats have a direct view into the kitchen area, which is kind of homey.  I'm pretty small, so the size inside wasn't an issue for me, but claustrophobes and bigger people might feel squished.  I ordered a hamburger and fries and my friend got an egg sandwich.  The burger was pretty good, but relatively small in comparison to what's generally served at restaurants.  If you're really hungry or a big eater, you'll probably want to go for the double burger.  The fries were good - nice and crisp.  My friend was pretty happy with her egg sandwich but unhappy with her cup of water, which was apparently pretty bad even for tap water.  They have a bunch of organic sodas, along with Coke and Diet Coke, if you're like me and can't wash down a burger and fries with anything but a carbonated beverage.  Overall, I thought it was a pretty cool place and will definitely return with more friends in tow.  (Possibly for one of their movie nights...movies + tasty food = a good time).  Bonus points for their helping with the downtown rejuvenation while also supporting local businesses (Schreiner's, Mary Coyle's).",

The truth is I come back to support local businesses in my neighborhood...I would come here anyday than go to a Fast Food burger joint..  The trailor that the restaurant is in is the cutest thing you will ever see...straight out of a 50's picture!  Its small but fitting...  The food is very fresh..I love their cheeseburgers and hotdogs..I sometimes even get some of their mango salsa/chutney on the side..they get it from this lady that homemakes it.. Not the cleanliness place but I guess thats what makes it tastes so great!!:)  Its the extra grease...I know that just sounds horrible, but True!  Anyways, support locals and their businesses...go go go!!!",

Once you get past the fact that there's nine seats, and the griddle takes up about 30% of the building, you realize that this is one of those special little haunts that makes cities cool. It's totally off the beaten path, but just three blocks from First Friday mayhem. You could drive right by and never even notice it (I had about 15 times).   Inside it's surprisingly sparce, considering it's about 75 square feet. There's no AC, just a few well-placed fans on full blast. I went in the middle of the afternoon in July and felt pretty comfortable, especially considering the kitchen IS the place.   And the food... you want greasy, delicious, messy, rich, heavenly sinful pig-out fare? What's that? You want it at dirt cheap prices and with friendly service? It's perfect. The cheeseburger is oozing cheddar, the fries are sliced about four seconds before they go into the fryer and they have french toast in a cup. Need I say more?",

The diner is a classic boxcar that stays True to it's roots.  The outdoor seating area looks quite enjoyable for a late night snack, though I'm not sure if they are open that late.  Gotta love the outdoor ordering window.  You're best best inside is if you can catch a seat at the corner of the counter.  You not only get a great view of the chef doing the cooking but have a nice fat fan behind you to cool you off.    We arrived shortly after it opened and chatted with the cook to get his suggestions on what to order.  Very friendly and funny.  The counter's got various coffee table books full of quotes and handy worst case scenario answers.    I had the Garfield which was a fried egg sandwich specialty.  I can't really recall all the ingredients but the salsa in the sandwich was amazing.  My girlfriend ordered the grilled cheese and it was knock out.  Prepared with olive oil, it was by far one of the best grilled cheeses I've ever had.  The french fries were done just right and the seasoning on them really hit the spot.  The total for both of us including a couple of ice teas was under twenty dollars.  A great deal anywhere.  Just a friendly reminder that it is CASH ONLY!  I had to run to a couple of nearby gas station ATMs since the first was out of order.  Pretty embarrassing but the chef didn't seem to mind and trusted us to return.  Can't complain about any part of the meal and would highly recommend it to anyone visiting Phoenix or any locals that have been snoozing on this gem.",

With 9 stools around a bar near a hot kitchen, it is a small place with a lot to see.  The cooks are very friendly and talkative, and will give you their opinion on their dishes if prompted.  Try the classic cheeseburger, fries, and soda - it's definitely a favorite.  The Welcome Diner is definitely small, but worth the wait (if there even is one.)

Now, I knew this was a hipster hangout, but I wasn't expecting the cute girl in the apron or the boy with tattoos to actually be working on the other side of that window. They didn't seem to mind that I was slightly drenched in sweat having walked there under the sun of a blazing March afternoon. They were quite nice and gave my sister and I a bowl of water for our doggies. Tattoo boy said he would even make us more fries if we wanted. The fries ($2) were not the best  and neither was my grilled cheese ($4) with tomato (yum!) and pickles (?). However, the food had a nice home-made quality to it and was all ready in about a minute. Peeps are right about the high-quality ingredients and the food is inexpensive. Holler.  P.S. Don't forget the Ca$hM0nayyy or to borrow from a sibling!",

The menu is very simple and it's nothing you couldn't get elsewhere, but the food is very good. You didn't really come here for the food though, did you... no, you came here for the atmosphere...  I went during the summer and it was pretty hot inside the little box. There were some fans working overtime to help compensate, but with the cramped quarters, the dining area is pretty close to the stove.   You can tell that for the people that own and operate this joint, it's definitely a labor of love. It's such a warm and inviting place to go. I can see eating here once in awhile for the experience, but it's not the kind of place I could see myself eating regularly... maybe it's because I don't live in the neighborhood. People in walking distance would definitely become addicted to the place.   I really enjoyed the food here. There were funny little books available for us to read and there was a notebook where customers could draw in. The whole thing was something I'll always remember... fondly. You owe it to yourself to at least check this place out once.",

We went for an early lunch so we were able to sit inside. The staff is friendly, and I think my dad enjoyed the fact that every time the waitress turned around, her rear end was right in his face. Dirty old men in close quarters. What can you do?   The food was great- I had the grilled cheese (minus pickles), he had a burger and we both had fries. I loved the grilled cheese- it was perfectly charred- and he had no complaints about the burger, which is a rare thing. The fries were perfection and I may have even dreamed about them that night.   I can't imagine eating here would be too fun in the middle of the summer, as most of the seating is outside, but it's a great little lunch spot, and they're also open late on First Fridays. Good to know, since getting food anywhere else downtown on a First Friday is next to impossible.   I'll definitely be back.",

I was introduced to this place by a friend of mine who is a regular patron.  It was a nice Saturday afternoon so we ate outside and I think the little diner (with 8 seats) was full.  I had a single patty cheeseburger and the favorite and a coke.  The favorite is fresh cut fries with peppers, onions and a few other things that made this a delicious side dish.  It was all soooo good... I am glad I had the opportunity to try it.",

The place is super small (8 seats) but that just adds to the authenticity of eating in what might one day be a museum piece of 1950's culture.  The food is incredibly good and surprisingly cheap. If it's the right day, be sure to see if they're making veggie burgers and ask for a float too. The staff is also really chill and make sure that you're satisfied.

It's definitely cramped, but that means you'll get to converse with your neighbors.  The menu is quite limited, although the food was good.  However, they don't give you plates and the food was *very* greasy (our sandwiches came on a piece of waxed paper and the grease quickly soaked through the paper onto the counter).  The other thing I didn't like, was that you had to *buy* (bottled) water if that was your drink of choice.  They had a cook, a helper and a waitress working in a VERY tiny space....the waitress was o.k., but the cook and helper were pretty friendly.  It seemed that everyone but us was a \"regular\", which was kind of fun; we had an amusing conversation with the three guys (co-workers) who sat nearest us.",

Outside, there is a variety of seating but most of the chairs are not dining type of chairs, good for laying out, but not for eating. It is very much like a picnic feel is what they are probably going for with it.   Well onto more important things is the food. Now I admit, I am not a fan of their type of food, so I mostly ate breakfast dishes. Their signature dish is the big Jim. It is a huge, messy, and not the healthiest of dishes but is fairly tasty. The Chicken breast is well done, but the biscuit was kind of dry and the gravy was kind of cold. I have been to so many places and tried so many biscuit and gravy, and no one ever heats up the gravy beside a luke warm temperature. I just don't get it, but anyways, it was luke warm and kind of bland. Most of the taste came from the chicken and bacon really, rest was kind of there.   I also had their welcome breakfast with sausage. Again the biscuit was not flaky or tender in the middle but dry which was a disappointment. Sausage was one of the best I have tasted even though it was swimming in grease. Eggs and potatoes were okay, nothing really inspiring but very greasy also. So this is their basic breakfast dish which I try at different places to see if there is truly something different about the place. Nothing stood out, but the sausage.   All in all I have to give them a 3 star, the quality and execution of the food does not deserve a 4 star and definitely they are not that creative or their food is so much different  and outstanding that it deserve a 5 star. They are definitely a high 3 star, and I would go back, would unlikely right away or on a consistent basis, but once in a while is definitely in the cards.",

    "text": "After a big night during First Friday, tired and slightly hungover, I needed some comfort food.  Outside of the Five & Diner franchise, I hadn't been to anything resembling an authentic diner in the Phoenix area.  Ever.  So what a surprise to find an old diner transplanted from back east into the downtown Phoenix area.  It's a little on the fringes as the immediate neighborhood is a little sketchy, but we were going for a late breakfast on a Saturday so I didn't worry too much about my car.  The diner itself truly is a timewarp.  The interior is a simple 9 stool diner with a cooking area just as tiny.  You can't help but converse with the waitress and the cooking staff since they're basically right in front of your face.  If you're looking for more room (and want to keep an eye on your ride), there's picnic tables with umbrellas outside.  We got here around 11am so my girlfriend and I didn't feel too self conscious ordering drinks.  I got the mimosa while she got the bloody mary.  I'm not sure what they put in those drinks, but they had some kick!  They weren't overtly alcoholic, but just spicier than other mimosas or bloody marys I've had.  As for the food, I came here for one thing.  A biscuit sandwich.  More specifically, the Big Jim.  Fried chicken, country gravy, bacon, and cheddar on a homemade biscuit.  Unreal.  The biscuit was flaky, buttery heaven.  The batter on the fried chicken was delicious and the gravy wonderfully hearty.  Easily the best biscuit sandwich I've had in the Phoenix area.  My girlfriend got the Andouille Scramble which was basically an omelette with andouille sausage, peppers and onions with a side of potatoes.  She saw how much I loved my biscuit so she added a biscuit with honey to her order and was equally impressed.  We so wanted to save room for the beignets, but we were stuffed.  Total for the two drinks, two entrees, the add-on biscuit, and tip came to about $40.  Had we done non-alcoholic drinks it would've been a little under $30.  Their ingredients are locally sourced so you pay a little bit of a premium for that.  But considering the quality of the food and the unique experience, it was money well spent.  Whatever you do, find a way somehow to include a biscuit in your meal here.",

Unfortunately i wish I would have waited ... I am the type of person that sees Mac and Cheese and I MUST order. I ordered the M&C ($8) and additionally added tomatoes and jalapeno ($2). My boyfriend ordered the Big Jim and the fries and gravy. I tried everything we that my bf and I ordered and nothing blew me away. The m&c was just okay, possibly not worth the $2 extra dollars i paid to ad so little vegetables. The big Jim was not the best, maybe a factor to that was that my bf ordered the patty medium well and it was not to my tasting. The fries and gravy were not bad, but i would not reorder.  The ambiance is very relax but very crowded. I was with a group of 5 and we had difficulty finding where to sit, so if you would like to dine there keep your eyes peeled for a good table. Also keep in mind I went on a Saturday night , so it may be busier compared to weekdays.",

    "text": "What I love most about Welcome Diner is that when you are there, it doesn't feel as though you are in Phoenix.  The menu is good ol' Southern comfort food with a twist; they have Deep Eddy alcohol's and they make amazing homemade lemonade...well it's a little page right out of the South (Austin, TX to be exact).  We need more places like this.    They have a vegan po-boy sandwich with fried avocado that I could eat everyday, it's just that good.  They use the freshest veggies, no really, so fresh that it was probably picked that very day from the Garfield community garden.  That's right, fresh AND local.  I also can't get enough of those delicious collard greens!  I was impressed with the staff because they knew exactly what was vegan (right down to which bread I could eat).  Any time I find a staff educated about ingredients, it's a win.  And anytime I have gone with my non-veg friends they rave about the menu as well, so I think it is safe to say that it is all yummy.  All in all, this place is simply adorable, quaint, fun and delicious.  It is small inside so if you can get in there, I highly recommend it.  The staff is very friendly and attentive which makes for an even better dinning experience.  There are also plenty of seats outside and a to-go window which makes it even easier.  Great place to hang out, meet new people and eat good food!",

I had the fried chicken biscuit sandwich and a side of fried avocado, both of which were great. Fried chicken was juicy and biscuit was flaky and tasted fresh. The fried avocado was awesome and like nothing I have had before.   My friend got a collard green sandwich with a fried egg on top. She smashed it and then raved about how great it was. Each sandwich came with a side of fruit which was the perfect side for the heavy sandwiches.   Like I said before I can't wait to go back!! Highly recommend, this is a local gem that I would love to see thrive.",

    "text": "Welcome Diner is a good place to go when the weather is nice and you've got lots of time on your hands. It's in kind of a strange neighborhood (you may see stray dogs running around) but the outside dining area is welcoming and cute. I don't like coming in here any kind of inclement weather because pretty much all of the seating is outside, which is a bummer at night or during the summer. Also, because the kitchen is so small and Welcome Diner is so popular, you may end up waiting 40 minutes for your food.  But....what saves Welcome Diner for me is the food. I love the fried chicken and the sausage biscuits and gravy. The sandwiches are also excellent! The orange juice is fresh-squeezed and refreshing, but the lemonade is on the bitter side and leaves something to be desired. I'd recommend the food at Welcome Diner to anyone, but the atmosphere isn't always a crowd-pleaser. I would love to see them in a brick and mortar, full-service restaurant! Maybe someday.",

The fires we excellent!!.   We each had a drink with our meal, they did not disappoint either.   I would eat here all the time if I lived closer, so maybe that is a good thing. I would weight about 500lbs.   If you are even remotely close, check this place out!!!",

Some food may be worth +hour wait but not this food - chicken biscuit, Mac and cheese, Brussel sprouts... Nothing to write home about, think you'll say the same if you've had any standouts of the dishes mentioned above. Can't give more than 2 stars for an overrated place that made me wait over an hour for food that didn't taste exceptional.",

I stumbled there with my bf after a house party in the neighborhood and we decided to eat and sober up before we left. I had the sunrise breakfast sandwich with sourdough (they were out of biscuits) and bacon mac & cheese. The sandwich was surprisingly really good without the biscuit I think I'll get it with bread everytime! The mac & cheese is heavenly!! The only gripe I had was that took a while for food to get to us. But I understand since we came right before closing they were a good amount people there already. So if you're ever drunk I'm the area and need some sobering up food I highly recommend!!",

    "text": "We went to Welcome Diner for Easter brunch and it was remarkable...   There are two things in that sentence for which I am grateful.   Thing 1: Thank you WD for being open on Easter. I'm not a religious man. Easter is just another day of the week for me, however I am a man who can appreciate a day off work. That said, I am grateful that you were open so that I and my degenerate crew could enjoy your establishment.   Thing 2: Thank you for having delicious food. That is all.  This was our first time trying Welcome Diner. We pretty much almost tried one of everything... because why not.   The Fried Green Tomato Sandwich and the Biscuits and Gravy were my top two items. As I've declared unabashedly in the past, I'm from the south and these two items brought me back home. Very well done in their own unique way.   I think the thing that was most surprising about WD is that they were churning out this great food from such an unassuming place. It looks like they just dropped a little ol' diner right in a residential neighborhood. The location is also just east of Roosevelt Row, in a slightly more rough area. Not bad, but some people might shy away.   The only issue I see, particularly with summer coming up is that, if I'm not mistaken (which I could be), majority of the seating is outside. There are sun shades, but from our experience, even with said shades, if you're sitting in the wrong spot, you could still get pretty toasty from the sun.   We sat outside on our visit because it was beautiful. Although as the morning moved along it did get uncomfortable at times when the sun would be at just the right angle to blast you for just long enough you could feel the sunburn happening.   All that said, get there while the weather is good! And if you do get warm, they make some refreshing mixed drinks (I had the Hurricane) and they also have a nice little beer selection as well. I almost forgot about that... I probably need to drink less of them next time.",

It's tucked in a neighborhood, with a red and white trailer, neon lights, and string lights over wooden tables. It's so perfect that I wish I thought of it myself.   You order at a little window and can see three guys all crammed inside, cooking up amazing food. They had happy hour specials while I was there, and I got a local draft beer that was delicious. After much debate, I settled on the North Carolina pulled pork biscuit and a special side salad with a shallot vinaigrette (although it was hard not to order skinny fries and Brussels too!). I was worried it would be packed, but there were just enough people to comfortably eavesdrop and still have some elbow-room.   The food was amazing. You can tell everything is made in small batches, with love and attention to detail. Someone came out and checked on me while I was eating, offered to grab me another drink, and whisked away my dishes as soon as I was finished. Overall, it was a perfect dining experience, and I only wish I could pick this place up and plant it down on the East Coast!",

I would not want to be here when there is a line, but if you have the time and want a leisurely night out a line is worth the wait even so. However, with that being said do not.come here starving because you do have a bit of a wait for your food, understandable though the place is tiny and the food comes out incredibly fresh !!   We got the fried green tomato sandwich with bacon added it was so good with great textures and flavors..bread a bit too crisp (blackened) at some points but a unique and yummy dish. We also had the bumblebee biscuit sandwich which was really good, the chicken was moist, crunchy , but not filling enough despite it being heavy. We also got the happy hour pork fries, prettty good, but I'll get plain fries next time, liked the slaw and the sauce on top.  Food good, staff was very helpful, local beer, and cool atmosphere.   I would come here again for sure.  I had to deduct one star only because of the bathroom situation ...I'm borderline germaphobe and I almost couldn't stand the bathroom. It's a unisex , airline bathroom size stall with a sliding/folding door, that is right off the kitchen line !! Eek, kinda crazy, just avoid needing a restroom if you are a germaphobe, and even more so if you're extreme about it.   Welcome Diner ,you're great I hope to visit in the summer to keep the spirit alive !",

Food was good - he had burger, I had chicken on a biscuit (chicken a little too thick) but so good.  Just wish we were closer. Love love love!",

Fried chicken on a fresh biscuit with a refreshing salad, served outdoors in what looks like someone's front yard.  Heck, I pulled up and almost pulled away but something told me to stop, give it a chance and boy am I glad I did.  Great service, to die for food.  You can really tell the chef loves what he does.",

I had a cashier give me a quick run down on how the restaurant works, the chefs finished my meal in a timely manner, and the dish washer did a great job on cleaning my plate and utensils. If there's something that can make me loose my appetite and make me not even bother touching the my food is seeing old food from a previous customer still on my plate and silverware.   I got the No Way Jose burger which was delicious but small.  I finished it in 5 bites.",

    "text": "Honest comfort food in a sweet ass, remodeled RV and plenty of outdoor seating. Wayne (owner/manager?) said \"thanks, we try really hard\" when I complimented them on the food and experience. Yet, one of the greatest things about this place is they don't inundate you with being those people that try too hard. They don't force their efforts unto you, it just happens organically. Watching them work behind the bar and in the kitchen was a thing of beauty... so fluid, every movement and each interaction is performed with meaning and genuine care. It makes you feel at home while also being right in the middle of the action. Food and drink were fantastic and well priced ($6 old fashioned at happy hour??). Got the No Way Jose burger and fries, girlfriend got the same but with Brussels sprouts. The biscuit sandwiches and the poutine made my mouth water watching them pass by, but I didn't try them on this trip. Pecan pie . Recommend eating inside at the bar if there is seating, so you get the full on experience of the hustle and bustle behind the counter. Then, grab another drink and head outside if it's not 120 out. This place is a great way to start your evening. Compliments to Wayne and the rest of the staff!",

I ordered the little birdy (chicken,biscuit,cheese) it was good but a little hard to handle. Also had the jambalaya as an appetizer (big enough for 2 to share) I would order it as an entree next time.   The seating arrangements are mostly outdoor, which is fine when the weather is nice like it has been in March but would be a bit much in summer months.   My rating is based on the items I liked, I didn't go 5 star based on the price points of some items and the lack of soft drink options. This wouldn't deter me from returning in the future.",

Hold on I have to eat these beignets before I finish my review.... Ok I'm back...... Or when a meal is so delicious that it makes me moan with ecstasy . As you may have guessed, this is a  review inspired by the latter.  I'm usually a silent eater , but I was literally moaning and groaning the entire meal.   Generous portions, very friendly (and cute) staff, and ummmmmm. ..... Secret menu desert selections. I won't even attempt to try to put the meal into words because the description wouldn't do it justice. So just check out the pics below. I was almost hesitant to write this review bc I didn't want more people to come to this place, but these guys deserve all the credit ! Good job Welcome Diner! I am a believer !

Low and behold the diner was there, random in the middle of this Phoenix neighborhood. There are a few seats inside but the real experience is to sit out front. Do not expect to sit down at a normal booth and keep to yourself. The seating is basically lawn furniture and a few picnic tables giving the whole experience a backyard barbeque feel. As far as atmosphere \"hipster\" would be the greatest understatement of the year. I could have ridden a bicycle made of mustaches wearing the first black rimmed glasses ever made and I would not have been hip enough among the patrons. The menu is small but efficient and the food we received tasted great. I recommend the fried chicken sandwich with bacon and a hurricane to drink.",

    "text": "They're back as of today, and they're awesome. I was turned on to the Welcome Diner by a classmate at a software training I was attending, I said I was a food nerd and he told me that these guys were reopening today! Solid yelp reviews sold me, and they did NOT disappoint. They opened at 5:00, but I got off of class at about 4:15, so I went down there and hung around for a bit. After unsuccessfully attempting to help out with their square credit card thing (they can take cards, but it'll show up as the food truck because the restaurant account isn't setting up properly), I placed my order. I was the first customer, yay! Amazingly, the only other opening day jitter I saw was the ricecooker being ornery and tripping the circuit breaker repeatedly. In terms of \"disasters\" that's a pretty minimal one. I chose to wait for the rice to finish and get my meal all together, as I needed to burn time to avoid getting out of central Phoenix back to Tucson at rush hour. I had the port of call burger and a side of red beans and rice (the ricecooker worked in the end). Best burger I've had, I think ever. All the ingredients were high quality, very nice cheddar cheese, mushrooms cooked with port, and garlic aioli. And the bun. Oh damn, the bun. Feathery is the best adjective. No unevenness in texture, light, and just barely strong enough to contain the burger... well maybe not entirely contain. The red beans and rice were good - I'm not well versed in the craft of that dish, but it was tasty. Both the other customers that ordered inside got the fried chicken biscuit sandwich with apple butter made by one of the staff. They seemed very happy with their choices.  They've got beer, wine, and hurricanes. Right now they're open Thursday-Saturday 5:00-10:00pm for dinner, and Saturday and Sunday from 10:00-3:00pm for brunch. I snuck a peek at the brunch menu, and there looked to be some tasty stuff there too. They're going to work on expanding dinner service out over more of the week gradually.  What are you doing? Yeah.  You. Why are you still reading this? Go get a burger or something from here. Blah blah blah it's Tuesday at 9am and they're not open, sure, whatever, maybe that excuse will fly with your family, but not here mister/missy.",

I ordered the Big Jim which was a biscuit sandwich that was huge with a friend chicken inside covered in gravy, cheese and bacon. I threw on some Louisiana hot sauce and went at it. I had to eat it with a fork and nice because it was such a good hot mess I couldn't pick it up without ruining the layers. My girl ordered the Little Birdy which was a fried chicken piece topped with cheese and sandwiched in between a biscuit, both came with a couple pieces of watermelon and both were satisfying.  The fact that they close pretty late is awesome and its probably one of the main reasons why I would come back here.",

    "text": "For those that haven't heard, Payton Curry has taken over Welcome Diner April through May on Sun, Mon, Tues, and First Fridays. Get there... now. Payton is known for pushing limits and incorporating fresh, local ingredients. The menu will likely change every week, if not every night, so I'm not sure if my recap will help all that much, but here goes.  The neighborhood is sketchy, the place is tiny, and the accommodations are \"rustic\", so if you're all into the Scottsdale scene or flashing your dough, don't bother. That being said, Shantal mentioned that being there made her feel like she was camping every night, and I have to admit the evening had a vacation feel to it... National Lampoon's style!  You can instantly tell that Payton is having a blast and it shows on his face and in the food. We were seated on a collection of old dining chairs at a makeshift table of 2x8s and construction horses in the middle of the front yard, with a candle to light our way... I knew it was going to be a sweet evening!  We started with the burrata that was lightly seasoned with truffle oil and cracked pepper. Unfortunately a lot of people are adding burrata to their menus and they have no idea that this fresh, creamy, delicate version is how it's truly meant to be. It was served with slices of toast that I expected to be the brick-hard version to which I've become accustomed. Imagine my surprise as I bit into a spongy, buttery slice of bread with just a crunch of the crust! Delicious.  The porcini foie gras terrine will scare those faint of heart, but it's amazing and the pear butter adds this velvety, sweet flavor that just makes it unforgettable. I wasn't a fan of the pate', but it was a combination of pickle, horseradish, and mustard flavors with chunks in the loaf... all things I can personally only handle in moderation individually and generally dislike, so it was exactly as described. The mains arrived and the Sonoma lamb sugo proved to be an interesting choice. It's not something you would eat on a regular basis, but I'm so glad I got to try it. The shreds of lamb meat were piled on top of a bowl of hearty fettuccine with perfectly cooked chickpeas and dollops of cream that muted any gaminess of the meat. Then you would get a bite of golden raisin to kick in a touch of sweetness; pretty cool combination of flavors and textures without being over the top.  Perhaps the biggest surprise of the night was the bowl of Bolognese that was planted in front of us, it blew me away and I have no idea why!! Payton, what's your secret with something so simple? Dessert followed with apple pie that could've been much tastier if it were warmed with a scoop of ice cream, but all was rescued with a huge chunk of bread pudding that puts my mother's recipe to shame (and it was served warmed with a scoop of ice cream :).   All in all, we had a wonderful night with fabulous food and fun friends and we didn't want the night to end. If you want a hint of adventure, get to Welcome Diner before the end of May... seriously... National Lampoon's style.  ps: It's BYOB!",

Specifically asked if a whiskey and soda would be the same price as a gin and tonic... ended up 4 dollars more. 8 dollar whiskey and soda the whiskey and sour ended up being 18 dollars. Total should have been  14 bucks. After asking the mgr what had happened, he explained that since it was house made ginger soda, it's a 4 dollar extra charge. Ended up just settling the tab and then my girlfriend ordered me a drink. Half a hour later and everyone at the table has their drink... Except me. Asked the manager again what was going on and it ended up in a verbal altercation with him. The summary of the argument was that I asked for my drink, then the whiskey and soda was brought up by him again. Eventually just let him know that I will be posting a review on google due to his behavior. Quote unquote response from the manager \"Google? Never heard of it.\". Keep in mind this is with a whole line of guests behind me and they're listening pretty intently by this point.  Waited a couple more mins, my girlfriend at this point just goes to get the money back. Guests behind definitely took note as their first question \"was the service that bad?\" Yes. Yes, it was.   Childish at best. Will not frequent this location again. What sucks is that I've been going here since they were running out of the food truck years and years ago.",

Everything we ordered was delicious and reasonably priced. The staff was very friendly and prompt.   HIghly recommend to come after dark in the summer because it is so blazing hot (mostly outdoor seating). We will definitely be returning for more pulled pork fries!",

    "text": "This is a long overdue update. I don't think it gets much better than the Welcome diner. This place is legit delicious, I would struggle to find a meal I have had here that was sub par.... And I've been here many times (more than my check ins reflect). I try to bring people here as often as possible, family, friends... Because it is just that good. My favorite time to come is brunch..... One of the guys who works behind the counter gave me official credit for ordering the sunrise sandwich with egg over medium add tomato confit.... Add the confit... You will not be sorry. This thing is better than the lux egg sandwich (and if you know me, you know that's a big deal). The egg is always cooked perfectly, the biscuits are always buttery, flaky, and wonderful. The sandwich is the right mix of decadent and fresh.... Oh and if the husband gets the biscuits and gravy.... Put a little gravy on that sandwich and it's heavenly. Plus, they give you real cream for your coffee... Did you hear me? Heavy fricken cream!!! So good. Make sure you follow these guys on facebook for their beautiful daily specials that you wouldn't find in any other diner in the world (fresh made chicken and dumplings with butter poached chanterelle mushrooms for example). Have the pb and bacon burger... So yummy. Drinks? Forget about it, they are fantastic and happy hour has great specials. Sit inside the diner for great conversation and a bit of a show during your meal. Don't hesitate in trying this place out.",

    "text": "I heard a lot of great things about this place and was super excited to check it out. I ordered the Bumblebee (fried chicken, biscuit, honey, mustard) and my husband ordered the  PB&B burger (burger with peanut butter and bacon).  My dish came with a few pieces of sweet watermelon and his came with a side of slaw. We first experienced a peanut butter burger at rehab where they also add grape jelly and sriracha and my husband has been on a PB burger roll ever since. He thought his burger was very tasty and ate his whole plate. I liked my biscuit dish but I think I was expecting something a little more....substantial? The chicken was really great and moist but it felt like there was something missing. I think I was expecting it to be slathered in honey/sauces but it was certainly worth the price ($8.50). I'd definitely come again but I think I'll try another dish next time.",

    "text": "Here's the deal. I want to totally love this, but frankly, Phoenix is still missing the traditional diner, even when it's housed in an authentic diner. I was hoping this would be the epic college hang-out, but it's too expensive for that. An 8 buck burger is three dollars away from a night out for a collegiate. 5 bucks for a 12 oz plastic cup pour, even a good draft, is still not in that ballpark. Actually, it's close to ballpark pricing. Knock off at least a buck.  And 4 dollars for a very small portion of collard greens will not bring me back to eat it.  I ordered the most expensive meal because I wanted the food experience. Their PB and B burger is exceptional, peanut butter with burger sounds weird, but it's damn tasty and good Schrieber's bacon(also used at Bill Johnsons Big Apple for less dinero). It's the highest price burger at $12.50. I also had the previously mentioned collard greens and a 7 buck Hurricane, tasty and well-mixed, almost at price point correctly with such good ingredients.  Three items and with tip, over $28.00.  This falls into the realm of special event for me, and that's a shame as the folks running the kitchen, taking orders, owners are ALL great and the service was really casual yet efficient.  I would love to see something like a whiskey and soda for $4.00, discounted pitchers of beer, maybe even a discount for bringing in your own coffee cup or dishes as there really is a lot of plastic waste coming out of there.  Sure, I'll be back, and for what it is(an amazing restoration of a wonderful place with a killer patio)I'm glad it's here. I'll have whatever is on special now, and skip the sides, though the fries with gravy could be killer with cheese curds a la  poutine.   Yet still I wait for the college hang-out.",

    "text": "Wow.  So I've been hearing about this place for a while.  I always looked for it when I passed it on my way down Roosevelt but always seemed to miss it.  I practically smacked myself in the forehead when we arrived today.  I felt stupid, but then again, there are some places I just can't see until I plan to stop there.  It took some convincing to get my husband to give a place other than his favourite Joe's Diner a chance for a delicious (post hangover) brunch/breakfast a chance.  We got there a little early due to it being their last brunch weekend before summer and I am paranoid of crowds and hipsters.  We arrived and found ourselves seats under an umbrella in the shade.  We got some water from the cooler and perused the menu and specials.  After some deliberating (sunrise sandwich or holy puerco?) and discussion (welcome breakfast has no meat -- I need my protein at breakfast), he went with the special boudin breakfast and I got the holy puerco.  We both had fresh squeezed ojs and beignets.  It was worth it.  Dear goodness I have not tasted pork jowl cruncy bits like those ever (and their meat is provided by meat shop and shreiners!).  The combination of flavors on the puerco thing was just delicious.  And the hashbrowns were fresh and not too crispy and not overpowering and flavorful.  I kind of wanted some sour cream to go with the flavors and make them like a crunchy baked potato.  The beignets are not as fluffy as the ones I remember in New Orleans but definitely will satisfy this girls desire for fried dough.  They are yummy and powdered and you must be careful or the sugar will make you cough.  The honey is also oh so good.  The husband very much enjoyed his boudin special and it was gone very quickly.  He said it was all very tasty and he was glad we braved the heat for the opportunity to try the breakfast before it is gone.  We also got a hurricane to share at the very end.  It tastes like juice, or sunshine in a cup.  But it does pack a punch.  I felt that drink (the few sips I had) by the time we got back home.  And then I crashed in a delicious food coma.",

It took me a while to decide what I wanted to try and I ended up selecting the jambalaya. This version did not have shrimp, which is something I can eat my weight in, but it was still excellent. The portion was larger than it appeared and I didn't even come close to finishing it.  When I got there, there was maybe one other customer outside. After the sun set, this place was very busy.

All the workers are so kind here and the comfort-style-food they sell is so seriously bomb! Parking can be a pain, and yes you'll probably have to wait a good half hour to an hour to eat, but it will all be worth it because you have to wait to get a good seat anyway.",

It's a small kitchen, and very popular, so expect a bit of a wait. The seating is relaxed and inviting. The din of the eating area is perfect, as it is outside. Great place to come and lay back for awhile or before going into first Friday that is just down the street.   I suggest the ginger beer, it's house brewed and delicious! Any drink with it was not a let down (I had a few) I also had the honey biscuit sandwich and tried the free tomato also. Everything I've tried here is tasty.",

I heard it gets really busy on the weekends so thurs was the perfect time to try it out. It's strange how the diner sits in the middle of a quiet neighborhood but whatever, I'm here for the food. We got the poutine fries, fried chicken biscuit sandwich, a side salad, and beignets to top it off. Everything was so delicious even down to the salad.  I would definitely come here again. The beignets are a little more dense than the ones in New Orleans and I've never had it with honey before but nonetheless it was still pretty yummy.",

This nice waiter kinda noticed and he put her to the side and took care of us he sorta kinda saved the night.  We had the fries that we didn't order thanks waitress we paid for them anyway... we had the chicken biscuit sandwich with watermelon lol!!! It was ehhh edible lacked seasoning ..perhaps leave the frying of chicken to people who actually know what they are doing....we also had the Mac n cheese! Try that, the portion was huge and it was so yummy. Honestly forget everything else on the menu try the Mac and cheese the combination of flavors was just wow! Anyway They ran out of sourdough so couldn't have the grilled cheese... and I didn't want to have it on any other kind of bread... the pork sandwich could have had better seasoning it was bland just bland... I'm a New Yorker and a huge foodie so coming here I was expecting spectacular food especially due to the great reviews on yelp.... but yeah maybe they had an off night... I will admit the place is well decorated looks like a fancy cafeteria. The drinks are cool... prices are not bad..I'll try it again next time I am in the area.   Don't bring your parents",

What an upgrade from their old one, they still have a patio for outdoor seating but a more spacious interior as well as 2 bathrooms. The inside is a cute diner them, obvi, and we ended up sitting at the bar. It was a lot of fun to watch them cook the food and see what all the food looked like. We ended up ordering the koko biscuit sandwich, bumblebee biscuit sandwich, a side of fries and an order of poutine. The koko and bumblebee were very good, I'm not usually a fan of fried chicken but this check was cooked perfectly and so flavorful. The biscuits themselves were nice, but I would prefer they be a little more buttery, melt in your mouth. They were on the drier side. The fries were perfectly seasoned and crispy. The poutine was also good, but a little on the saltier side for me. My friends also ordered some drinks, the old fashion was SO STRONG, sure to put some hair on your chest. Apparently they make their own ginger beer in house so we had to try their mule and the ginger beer gave it an intense kick, a little too much for me.",

Better than any feta I've ever had. But the real show-stopper for us was the fries. Very likely the best french fries we've ever had. They're not fancy, not dressed up, just perfection. The service was also fantastic. This is an order at the window mostly outdoor diner, but there was a guy who kept coming out and checking with each table, so it felt like sit-down service. We loved the friendly, casual vibe. Made for a very relaxing evening. I'll go out of my way to go back again. *My only wish is that they'd serve milk shakes. :)  Update 3/18- We've been back a few times and every time has been fantastic. This last time we tried the mac & cheese and now understand what everyone raves about! Yum! My husband says it's the best he's ever had, but that's the way with everything here.. best burgers, best fries, best service. I have no debate on this anymore, this is the best burger in the valley. Crazy good. And when's the last time you went to a order at the counter place where they introduced themselves, the cook, and assured you they'd be taking care of anything you need? And they do! Really wish I lived closer!",

    "text": "Man, to be brutally honest, I was a bit disappointed!  I had heard about this place for about 1.5 years now.  My buddy at work told me about it, as well as a couple of my Yelp friends have reviewed it.  It sounded like a cool concept, it was open late, and some of the food items sounded fantastic.  Me and my buddy had some time to kill before picking up a friend at the airport, so we decided to stop by for some late night grub.  I browsed the menu for a bit and decided to go with an order of poutine, and a Bumblebee sandwich.  Total for those 2 things was a little over 20 bucks!  STEEP!  Anyways, here is how they were.............  Poutine-  These were some fries topped with sausage gravy and cheddar cheese.  A bit different than a \"traditional poutine\", but close enough?  The fries themselves seemed a bit overcooked, like they were left in the fryer an extra 20 seconds or so.  They were a bit brown, but not really \"crispy\".  The sausage gravy tasted ok, and the melted cheddar was kind of \"meh\".  It wasn't a horrible plate of fries, but no way in hell does it justify the $9.00 price tag.   There were actually fries left on the plate (That rarely happens!) when we were done!  I would not get them again.  Bumblebee-  This was a biscuit sandwich which came with chicken, mustard, honey and pickles.  The chicken was fried proper and tasted alright, but the portion was skimp and the texture of the chicken was just a bit \"off\".  The biscuit itself was incredibly large, but a bit dry.  I had a similar experience up in Portland at Pine State Biscuits.  Rave reviews, but when it came to the biscuit, the biscuit was sub par.  What's up with that?  It's your signature item, but unless you drown it with gravy/sauce/mustard/something else, the biscuit just isn't that great!   The pickles may have been the best part of the sandwich.  Lame, right?  I ate the whole thing, but was not truly satisfied.  For $10.00, I wouldn't buy it again.  Overall, not that impressed!  Service was friendly, and the joint is a cool little spot, but the food is just ok and the price is really expensive (IMO).  Once was enough and I highly doubt that I will be back.  There are just so many other places I would rather drop $20.00 at for a meal.  Exactly what 2 stars is...\"Meh...I've experienced better!\"",

    "text": "I love the vibe and location of this place!  Nestled within a neighborhood in downtown Phoenix, outside patio dining (there's never any room in the small trailer, whenever I've eaten here), and a great view of the stars are just some of the great aspects of this particular diner.  It's definitely a departure from the typical dingy diner, that has mostly artificial lighting; and is surrounded by hipster patrons.  No, wait! Hold on a sec!   Except of the latter comment; it truly is a breath of fresh air - literally!  The food isn't spectacular, but that isn't the allure of this place. It's just an awesome place to hangout, and enjoy a decent meal. This particular time, we had the Welcome Burger and Fries; as well as, Grilled Cheese and Watermelon with a side of Jackfruit fries.  Definitely a unique meal with an allure all its own. Particular notables were the juicy hamburger, crispy bacon, yummy jackfruit fries, and the sweet watermelon!  The weather outside was just perfect, and everyone working here were so friendly and chill.  The place is definitely \"on fleek!\"   There, that's my first and final homage to the urban hipsters that were seated next to us that basically used nothing but words found in the hipster vernacular dictionary.  Nonetheless, I love this place!",

    "text": "If I'm right I'm going to be the 1000 review for welcome diner so congrats to me. welcome diner is a location which has switched locations recently but a location that I love quite a lot. I don't know if it's the amazing drinks that they serve there which will run you upwards of $10 per drink but I have to admit it's worth it they're tasty cocktails tasty mixed drinks that I have come to like so much that even if I'm just ordering one with their fried chicken sandwiches I have to order a drink because oh my God it's good. Now the food a slight addiction I kind of feel like if I live downtown I'll go there all the time once again you know it'll run you upwards of $10 per menu item but they're little bird every I don't know just everything fries they come with it when it comes to ordering food. friendly time they had a nice little atmosphere to it of course the diner lolcow but always so clean that's one of the things I love most about it indoor outdoor no matter what you're seating more sitting outside obviously but the location is just always clean it's open up pretty late so if you're a late night snack or past midnight they are open don't be don't get there too late because they might run out of what you need on menu. That's a good thing so they keep food pretty fresh and for each menu item I don't know what it is but it's a great amount of food. Breakfast is there is also good there till like to just throw out you'll probably eat your sandwiches with a knife and fork depending on what you're getting unless you are liking a little messy but at the same time another thing that I strange Life is I like the people that go there there are this mixture of a tattooed hipster / a mixture of other people coming from clubs and bars but obviously local folk who support the welcome diner and I was great to see everyone's friendly and they're probably friendly because they're being filled with amazing food so credit to them there. Also I like that they have kind of like it's open kitchen thing which is always a bonus love seeing that people are wearing gloves and hairnets and so far and following regulations unlike certain pretty much franchised Mexican food locations where they do not wear gloves half the time if you would pay attention but anyway back to it welcome diner 1000 review on Yelp so I think I deserve for that",

The patio is still comfortable and inviting with that order at the window vibe! I cannot wait to bring my dog to the new place!! Inside they kept the same vibe at the trailer just bigger! The open kitchen concept is fun to sit at the bar and be a part of the action! The low booths are super comfortable and allow you to take it all in-- not to mention a Disco Ball!!! What?!?! So fun!!  On to the best part of 2.0-- THE FOOD!! YUM!! There are still my favorites from 1.0 (the amazing No Way Jose Burger and the Bumblebee!!) BUT NOW There are some new dishes that are too good to pass up: The Pickled Shrimp Toast is a must try!! Light and airy foam on toasted Noble bread-- ummm yes please!!! Seafood etouffee-- the rice was perfectly cooked and had the right amount of acid to balance the whole dish!! Chorizo Meatloaf: if my Nana made meatloaf--this would be it but better! The sauce on this dish is the right balance of flavors to leave an empty plate!! (I would have licked my plate, but people were watching!!) The desserts are just as tasty as before!!  The last mentionable is the cocktail menu!! The classics are still there - Hurricane!! (cheers from across the room) and then there are some new amazing drinks to help you settle into the comfy booths!!  Kudos to the whole Welcome Crew on the new spot!! I am craving another Welcome Diner fix!!!",

A hipster will seat you, another will wait on you, a third will cook your food. There will be so many ironic t-shirts and tattoos you will feel like you have been invited to the cool kid's table in art school. Groovy!  This place is awesome. It's super small, so if you want to sit inside at a table, you need to time it right. I think the bar is the best place to sit. You get to watch the geniuses in the kitchen crafting beautiful delicious food in a culinary rhythm that pumps out consistent perfection. You can also grab a table on the patio which provides views of the goings on in this artsy neighborhood that is undergoing a socioeconomic transformation. Smarties like to call it gentrification. Hipsters hate that term. They also hate the term hipster, but I digress.  They serve classic diner titles in a way that will blow you away. Meatloaf that doesn't need ketchup. Like at all! Fried chicken and biscuits that are pure mouth joy. And then there's the fried green tomato sandwich. It is one of the most glorious things I have ever consumed whilst sitting on a barstool. And that's saying something! (I am no stranger to the bar stool.)  Their mixologist (AKA hipster bartender) is an angel sent to earth by the Jesus that loves gin. If you want to stick with beer, their list is perfect for those that like great local brews. Can I get an amen for Mother Road's Tower Station IPA?  If you are on some kind of fad diet or any diet at all, this is the place you will want to cheat. It's worth it. I promise. They open at 5:00 PM so don't show up for lunch. Get there right at 5:00 on a weekday, and you can sit at the bar. Get there at 7:00 or 8:00, you'll be ordering at the outside window and hipster watching on a picnic table. If you're lucky.",

My boyfriend got a biscuit with fried chicken and he thought it was awesome!  My sandwich was incredible, a crunchy baguette with perfectly spiced jackfruit! I had grabbed ketchup just in case but didn't even need it. My boyfriend didn't like the charred top of the mac n cheese but I thought it was good. He did like the underneath part of it. We also tried the home-brewed ginger beer and it was tasty! The ginger was extremely strong but very good. Took a while to get our food but this was a fun place to just hang out so it was not a problem. We both can't wait to come back!",

It's a small trailer-like spot with a bathroom reminiscent of one in an airplane. It was cooler inside but a bit cramped of course, and I didn't appreciate being around alcohol and the smell but it was worth it being indoors.  We ordered the jackfruit fries from their HH menu to start and I got the Bumblebee biscuit. My brother got the Koko biscuit, which he enjoyed. I thought the fries were great, shoestring topped with purple slaw and jackfruit, such an interesting and tasty food. I loved my biscuit, the fried chicken was done right and the sweet and savory flavors of honey and mustard worked really well. Topped with pickles for a nice crunch and change of texture.   There are several vegan options as noted by the V on the menu. Definitely a great spot for dinner and open late.",

We ordered 2 mix drinks, shared the Champion Burger and fries(very good) and shared the macaroni and cheese with tomato confiti.  It came out to 36$ plus 5$ tip.  My wife loved the macaroni, I thought it was alittle bland, maybe it was the confiti.  So far on my visits, I've had the hamburgers and chicken biscuit with gravy, all very good.  We both love the ambiance, the outdoor seating and the friendlyness of the staff and customers.  It's only 5 blocks from our house so it's very close.",

    "text": "Awesome atmosphere! This place has such a weird/ funky vibe with its red and white diner, mismatched patio furniture, and staff running around yelling out customer names. Each time I have come the food has been great but the wait is usually long. As expected, I stood in line for a while last night to place my order. Occasionally, the person taking orders will slide the window closed and the line will have to wait. While this seems a bit annoying, it gives the cooks time to catch up and the staff time to get hot food delivered to tables.  Upon his return, the guy at the window was upbeat, kind, and open to offer suggestions. The food took a bit under 10 minutes to come out but was VERY good and obviously fresh. We had a salad and the Koko chicken sandwich with a side of brussel sprouts. I would definitely recommend this place as long as you have time to hang out!",

My husband got the bumble bee and the flavors went well together. The honey was delicious with the fried chicken. Overall I would recommend this place for the atmosphere and the food.

It is in the middle of a residential area but they have a lot of property and plenty of seating for guests outdoors.  We were fortunate to be able to sit inside.  They have 9 bar seats inside the \"trailer\".    The menu offers lots of delicious options - Waldorf Salad, Poutine, Fried Chicken on a biscuit, Fried Green tomato sandwich, fish, burgers, etc. and during happy hour, they offer reduced prices on some menu items!  Everything is made-to-order and if you are inside, you can see your meal being made.  They also have unique drink options and they are very tasty!!    The staff are really upbeat and friendly.  We got to chat with one of the guys who worked there.  He seemed really nice and genuinely cared about each guest's experience.  It is a really cool place.",

    "text": "I love the Welcome Diner. It's my favorite spot for late night eats in Phoenix (opens till 2am). It's such a cool concept and they serve up some pretty good-sized portions of food. Welcome Diner operates out of a Valentine Diner (a mobile pop-up restaurant from the 40's) and is located in the historic Garfield neighborhood (they have a second location in Tucson). They have both outdoor and limited indoor seating and serve up Southern-inspired American dishes made from scratch. You'll find huge buttermilk biscuit sandwiches, burgers, po' boy sandwiches, fried chicken and jambalaya on their menu along with a variety of delicious cocktails to choose from. In fact, Connor Mansager of the Welcome Diner was recently declared the 2017 Arizona Star Bartender at the Devour Phoenix Bartending Competition a couple weeks ago. I pulled a late nighter here with some buddies and we tore up a Big Jim (fried chicken, gravy, bacon and an egg on a biscuit), No Way Jose (a burger with jalapeno relish, smoked Gouda and chipotle ranch) and the Carol (braised pork and BBQ sauce on a biscuit). Another favorite of mine is the Peanut Butter burger. Our food definitely hit the spot after a fun night of boozing. Btw... share a side of fries with someone as they are pretty generous with their portions. I love the throwback ambiance of this place to old school diners of the past. My only knock is we had some smokers next to us as we ate our food on the patio. But overall a great experience as always and the staff is usually pretty friendly.",

Seating is open and you'll like be sharing you table with strangers. Which is cool. You get to meet new folks and swap foodie stories if you're lucky.  The food here is terrific. I had the grilled cheese sandwich. This was really good. It wasn't an over the top massive gob of gooey cheese. This sandwich was a savory treat on rustic sourdough bread. Very well prepared. My wife had the Koko. A biscuit sandwich with fried chicken breast & arugula topped with a creamy sauce with a little snap. We got a side of Bignets and a side of roasted Brussels sprouts. Both worth the price of admission.  If you like a good Bloody Mary, you have to try the WD version.  This place rocks. Once again, my fellow yelpers were spot on.",

I would bet money that they are the slowest restaurant in Phoenix. The slow service and the bad attitudes are the only things consistent about welcome dinner. They are constantly running out of menu items. Again I feel that this is a hipster gimmick but who knows.   If you like to sit outside and enjoy being treated like \"you don't get it\" while you wait 45 minutes for your food then hop on your fixy and head on down to Welcome Diner.

We shared a No Way Jose burger, beignets with local honey and powdered sugar, and a biscuit with preserves and goat cheese.  Let me tell you first of all: if you come here complaining about the wait, just remember that good food AIN'T fast food. Be patient and your patience will be rewarded! Every morsel of that food was delicious. The biscuit reminded me of breakfast at Grandma's house. That burger was juicy and full of flavor; even the bread was good. The beignets were warm,  crispy, chewy, and paired well with the local honey; finger-lickin good.  That was a good little taste, but I definitely wanna come back and try some more.

Staff is incredibly friendly! We went earlier in the night and it was a bit slow- so we were able to talk to the staff and ask for favorites and specials. The cook named Ryne was very helpful and had a great knowledge of the menu! I am a vegetarian and there were quite a few unique options for me. I ended up getting the fried tomato sandwich with a side of jackfruit fries. Both were excellently prepared and the service was great.  Thank you Ryne and the rest of Welcome diner for a great meal! I will be coming back every time I am in Phoenix!",

    "text": "Nice find. About a mile's walk from the downtown convention center, if you are looking for something different from the usual assortment of restaurants that cater to that crowd. This place seems to cater more to the university population nearby - it's situated right next to a residential neighborhood that seemed an unlikely spot for a restaurant but there it was. The cuisine is loosely organized around southern \"comfort food\", like jambalaya, fried chicken, and po' boys, but (as my waiter explained it) with a southwestern angle to it. There are vegetarian offerings, including jackfruit as a meat substitute (which I tried and liked a lot). I didn't order a drink, and came away for $20 including a 20% tip. I need to go back and try some more of their offerings, on a night when I'm in the market for a meat dish. It checks all the boxes for me, and so receives full marks.",

Line up and wait to order, while just standing there.  And wait. And wait. Several times the place was not taking orders because \"we are backed up\". Here's a hint. Take the order immediately and I can go sit down and wait. It beasts standing and waiting.",

    "text": "Welcome Diner was a welcome distraction in an otherwise very busy day. We had heard it was one of the best places to eat in Phoenix, and I can see why. Delicious, home style, southern food.   I ordered the bumblebee chicken biscuit sandwich. It was a little sweet for my taste, but that's understandable as honey is the star ingredient, but after some hot sauce all the flavors balanced out nicely.    My wife ordered the fried green tomato sandwich and she loved it. We also ordered poutine fries--I loved the gravy--and beignets for dessert.   Now I'm a little picky about my beignets, as I moved from Houston and visited NOLA often,  and these don't match up to Cafe Du Monde or other NOLA spots, but they were still finger licking good. Literally, the woman next to me was scraping the last of the honey out of her beignet bowl with her fingers and licking it off. And I could sympathize. I didn't want my meal to end after my last bite either.   The restaurant is very small. A handful of indoor seats and a small outdoor, community picnic style eating area. It took about fourty minutes for us to get our meal after we ordered, and that was with only 2 people in front of us at the order window. This felt like ages, but I forgot about all that when I took the first bite of my biscuit. We will be back. If you haven't been here yet, just go, so worth it!  Edit 2/26/16 Take out is definitely the way to do it!! Placed our order on the phone and was able to pick it up about 20 minutes later on a Friday night!!  The Champion Burger- Mmm, This is a tasty burger (Samuel L. Jackson Pulp Fiction voice).  If you're in the mood for a hamburger just order this!  You can't go wrong with The Champion Burger, it's a winner!!  The Mac & Cheese was yummy, adding Tomato Confit and Jalapeno Relish made it extravagant!",

However, be warned it is no longer \"cheap, under $10\" - but not by much - excluding our wine our shared meal clocked in at $15 each.  We each had a glass of Arizona wine labeled, merely, \"red\".

The fried chicken biscuit was good but only after I pulled the chicken out of it. The chicken itself was really tough and disgusting, luckily it slid out of the breading really easily. It would be nice if they used some sort of number system instead of screaming names every time they come outside with food or drinks, that would also eliminate the borderline awkwardness of the guy at the counter who asks for names. Last but not least of things I didn't like about this place which I know they cannot help is the other customers!!! One guy had an aggressive dog that almost bit some kid, there was another group of young 20 somethings that took out table even though we had full waters and napkins on it and there where 7 other open spots, then the other group on the other side of the family style table that was making some borderline offensive comments..... so needless to say after being around rude undesirable hipsters of all ages I probably won't be coming back.

They are worth every penny.  The sandwiches are some of the best I ever had. Jambalaya is amazing. The list goes on and on.  I've been here a couple dozen times and never had a bad experience. Yes this place gets busy at times but for a reason.  The happy hour drinks are a great deal too. Only the best ingredients for a more than fair price. Same for the food.  It's always a homey and welcoming and there are some great and very passionate and authentic people working here which truly reflects in the food.  If you haven't done so please come here and check it out. By now they have legendary status in the area already anyways.  Thanks for all the good moments I had there.",

    "text": "I saved my 400th Yelp review for this Phoenix gem. This is one of the first places I drag out-of-towners... usually for brunch. And when I have brunch at Welcome Diner, I usually cannot resist ordering the same thing, the Holy Puerco. Pulled pork, cheesy grit cake, pure heaven.  The best thing about this place, especially if you get one of the rare seats inside the luncheonette, is that it feels like you own the place. The staff cooking and carrying on are an arm's length away. I love the communal \"Hurricane!\" cheer that resounds whenever somebody orders one of these fresh-squeezed fruit cocktails. Welcome Diner is one of those places that the ambiance overwhelms you so suddenly that you are drawn in to the fun atmosphere... and though you may not be a morning drinker, you can easily be convinced that it's time for a beer or cocktail with breakfast.  I can't say enough about the wonderful poutine here. Other places may just smother their fries in brown gravy, but this place used the white breakfast sausage gravy. Although the cheese curds get a little lost, this is a great way to eat poutine! I also like their choice of either sausage gravy or mushroom gravy if you order the biscuits and gravy (or, do half-and-half, if you must).  The crowd that dines here is cool, the staff is righteous, and the food is spot on. If you want something funky and delicious and scratch-made, you would do well to pound a path to this wiggity-wack little diner in the middle of a dusty old Phoenix neighborhood. Off the beaten path, as it were...",

The diner area is a little small but the outside seating is fine as long as the weather permits.  Everything I've ever ordered off their menu has been excellent. Chicken sandwich is my favorite.  The staff all seem to really enjoy being there and take their time to make the experience special. The kitchen area seems cramped but the guys working the grill had a practiced hand and the food came out quicker than I would expect (although slower than most places with a full kitchen staff)  If you are looking to a unique date spot or a nice evening hangout with friends this is the spot.",

We managed to make it there after a concert, around 1am on Halloween. They were busy, but we managed to get a seat inside.   The diner is in an actual diner car, so it's tiny with a large, cute patio area. The cooks were churning out orders quickly. My boyfriend ordered a delicious White Russian stout and the blue sky burger, and I got my peanut butter burger with fries. The fries were great, the burgers were flavorful, unique and perfectly cooked. The bartender was great, and we very much enjoyed the experience. Cute, quirky little place. I'd definitely come back when I'm back in town.",

The Brussels sprouts were crispy and yummy. The poutine was good (nothing out of this world but good). The big Jim was delicious and savory but not as delicious as the bumblebee. The beignets were thicker than what I'm accustomed to but so so good. I'd get everything I ordered again. It was all superb.   As soon as I burn off these calories, I'm coming back!

After a long day of traveling, this place was everything. We loved the community feel, the twinkly lights, and the locally sourced ingredients. We split two burgers--the Welcome burger and the Blue Sky burger. Both were delicious and came with a side (we tried the cole slaw and the side salad). They have a cool retro bar and solid beer list, but we opted for the homemade fruit punch (which was so good). I wish we were in Phoenix longer so we could come back again!",

The food was not that of the typical diner but had a nice menu with salads, vegetarian items (fried green tomato sandwich), burgers, and their signature fried chicken and biscuit sandwiches (the bumblebee was delicious).

My wife and I both ordered burgers I just got the normal welcome burger (I think that's the name) and my wife got a peanut butter topped burger.

A really tasty 10 but not enough or maybe it was an illusion and they just need smaller plates.   I'll be going back soon for burgers and probably to try a few other menu items as well!",

And I love how there is Southern and Cajun style food. But even I couldn't have imagined something like the Holy Puerco--cheddar grit cake with cracklins and pulled pork. I also like the kale sandwich with the fried avocado. If you're getting the avocado, split it with a friend. Five pieces of that is a lot, in my opinion.  The biscuits are really unique. You can taste a difference from theirs and what you may get at another restaurant. The biscuit sandwich with the fried chicken and honey will hit just the right spot. I also like the biscuit with goat cheese and jam. And we can't forget about the peanut butter + bacon burger with fries. You may get some clogged arteries from sampling everything but it may just be worth it. I urge people to try this place. I'm sure it's only a matter of time before Guy Fieri parachutes in.   I ended up writing about this place for an article on restaurants worth highlighting in Phoenix. Besides the food, I think this has a terrific location to build on being the \"Cheers\" of the Garfield neighborhood. The patio is really inviting and you can watch residents coming and going since it's in a residential area. It is quite hipster-dominated but that's just what a lot of Garfield and the Roosevelt Row area are. Hopefully there will be people to welcome this place for a long time to come.",

There food is delicious and fresh. Check out my pictures I definitely recommend this outdoor diner to everyone you won't regret it. My favorite is the koko; crispy moist fried chicken in between delicious biscuits with a spicy cream sauce and fresh tomato and arugula with a side of sweet watermelon !",

    "text": "This is my new favorite joint.  It is becoming quite the neighborhood favorite and I think it's because they just do it right. The setting is so...welcoming. With the lawn chairs and variety of mostly outdoor seating this is the perfect spot for a beautiful day or night. The staff is a bunch of characters who are very genuine and helpful. The food has clever names like \"Holy Puerco and Captain Fantasy\") oh and it is freaking amazing. Even the menu's artwork looks awesome (done by a local artist/cartoonist.)  I've been here three weekends in a row. The first time I had the Captain Fantasy which was endlessly delicious. Barbecued chicken on a fresh homemade biscuit with bacon, cheese and greens. I also had fries, wow a lot of food! The other two times I've had the Sunrise Sandwich with sausage and an egg over easy. It is also placed between a tasty biscuit along with some arugula. Yum! My boyfriend has had the welcome breakfast with chorizo and the Little Birdy. I had bites! I also tried their fried avocado, genius.  They serve drinks. Apparently on Tuesdays they have Hurricane Tuesdays, $5 for their famous hurricanes. I've also heard their Bloody Mary's are brilliant.  Well done Welcome Diner well done. See you all next weekend!",

    "text": "This diner came well recommended by the nice folks at the Phoenix hostel just a few blocks away. Easy walking distance in this cool little neighborhood from the hostel and the fun stuff to do on 5th street.   The old diner still has the 50's vibe with classic neon, but the food is non-classical diner fare (in a great way), is healthy and satisfying, and the folks working there are legit - down to earth and friendly. Just chill folks, no pretense, great food.   It's awesome to be back in the \"south\" and see iced tea on the menu. I kept requesting more, and the cool tattooed chick just brought me out a pitcher, a whole bowl of lemon slices and a smile.  That's hospitality.   I had the \"KOKO\", a hand breaded, fried chicken breast in a homemade biscuit with some kind of homemade remoulade, baby greens, tomato and a side of vinegar-based red coleslaw. Awesome. Friends had a deep fried avocado (vegan) po-boy and the other gad the fish po-boy, both of which looked great.   Definitely coming back.  Edit:  BTW, just saw on their online menu that they have a beer terrine salad, don't know how I overlooked that last night, but I'm kicking myself. Any place that has beets on the menu gets an automatic A++.",

    "text": "I've never felt so compelled to use expletives in a review, but I feel like I could cuss up a storm and still not quite convey how much I'm digging Welcome Diner.   I've been here three times, twice in the past week, and I can't wait to go again. I had the holy puerco on my first visit, the big Jim on my second, and today I had the Carol with cheese, bacon, and egg added at the suggestion of the guy taking our order. Everything has been utterly impeccable. It's comfort food at its absolute finest. I can't wait to make it through their entire menu and I have absolute confidence that I'll find many more delicious gems just waiting to be devoured.   The atmosphere and location couldn't be any better either. Sitting outside on a nice wintry Phoenix day in Garfield will no doubt yield some good people watching and you'll be thankful to just be where you are.   In closing, I want to thank these folks for doing what they're doing. If you haven't been here yet, or if you're for some silly reason on the fence about giving it a shot, stop deliberating and get your tail over there. You'll be happy you did.",

My friend had the Welcome Burger and really enjoyed it. I ordered the brussel sprouts, jackfruit fries, and beignets to share. The brussel sprouts plate was large and filling and delicious. While the idea of jackfruit fries sounded appealing, I thought the taste got drowned out a bit by the barbecue sauce. We shared the beignets, and throughly enjoyed it. Overall a good meal at a super chill diner!",

The service is exceptionally slow, the food is bland, the biscuits are dry, the portions are small, the seating is limited, and the prices are high for what you get. I've been here on multiple occasions each time hoping the prior experience was a one off, but with no different outcome. I wanted to be a fan of this place after hearing the hype and reading the reviews but it really doesn't cut it. I'd highly recommend tempering your expectations as this place is memorable for all of the wrong reasons.",

I loved how hometown it felt. This is definitely a place where strangers become friends.  Fantastic service! Our server was Brandon, who was so helpful in making sure my meal was vegan and describing every delicious detail to us. Upon leaving, every employee waved and thanked us for dining. So nice!  On to the food...fantastic. I had a veggie burger with fried avocado on the side. Life changing. My boyfriend had the classic burger and fries, and loved it. I can't wait to come back and try the vegan po'boy.  I'm really excited to be a frequent patron of the Welcome Diner. So happy we found it!",

It was happy hour all day since it was Tuesday.  Awesome!! Service as polite and quick. The Hurricanes were refreshing but not strong. Don't let the neighborhood or decor scared tour away.
