Gotta have that crispy crust!!! The salad was actually very good size and the dressing was good. Shaved parm and a hefty amount of croutons. Our delivery driver, Anthony, was very happy and had a smile on his face when we opened up the heated carrier. Friendly and warm he also sprinted back to his car to get the shredded parm and hot peppers. Good dude!!! Will order again soon",

Then when the slice came to the table, it was cold.  The wing sauce was good but the wings were not hot.  I will not be going back to this restaurant for pizza or anything.

The pizza is amazing if you want a more expensive pizza (been eating $5 pizza forever forgot what real pizza taste like )other than pizza hut or domino pizza. The sauce is so good i dont know if it's homemade tomato sauce but it's perfect. The cheese,and meats are also very good. I've eaten once inside the restaurant and it was chill. Theres tv with sporta playing and it was clean. Love this place and any time I'm gonna spend money on a expensive pizza i will come here! And i only say expensive because im a college student.",

You will find the pizza greasier than Slices brand, but it's nothing a couple of napkins can't fix.  For wings we always get the sweet red chili (bone in) I consider the heat mild and it's pretty sweet and sticky. I also find these wings crispier than other flavors. They give you a lot of ranch for them but not a lot of vegetables. 1 container could easily go for two orders but the vegetable portion is more like half a serving.  I really enjoyed their White Slice one time but I can't remember what day it is on. I wish they just had all the slices they offered out everyday.  I'll tell you one thing though a lot of these pizza places claim that they are New York style pizza but I have yet to find a place that offers baked ziti pizza or Penne alla Vodka Pizza and even chicken Parmesan pizza. So if you know where I can get some message me!",

    "text": "Visiting Phoenix from NYC and have been avoiding eating pizza while I am here. However, I was told by more than a few people to try this place. Regretfully I made the trip today to try the pizza.   I went over to the counter to order and the girl asked what I would like. I said I'd like a regular and they looked at me like I was an alien. I clarified by saying a plain slice. But, still no change. Saying a cheese slice finally got me somewhere. Now I know why out of staters in NYC always say cheese slice.  After I paid. I went to sit down and waited what felt like forever. I was beginning to wonder if they were making each slice from scratch. I walked over by the counter to see what's going on and I see a conveyer belt style pizza oven. Now if you go to any pizzeria in NYC there's no way you'll see an oven that looks like that. It's usually Bakers Pride. Matter of fact the only place I had previously seen one of these ovens before was a Costco. This is when I knew I was about to be disappointed and I understood why it was taking so long they just thew everything in there and waited for it to come out.   Finally, once my slice was ready I went up to the counter to get it. I was greeted by the biggest slice I had seen. This thing was the size of two regular slices in one. Which I guess wouldn't be a bad thing. If the pizza was actually good.   Looking at the pizza, you can immediately tell this has nothing to do with a New York style pizza. The dough is way too thick and the crust way too soft. I'll agree with one of the other reviewers  on here. This thing was pretty much an equivalent of a Costco pizza. Actually, scratch that, you'd be better of getting a pizza from Costco not only does it taste way better - it's also cheaper.    After taking a bite from the slice I'm pretty sure I got 5x my daily value of sodium. There was more salt than pizza. I love pizza and I pretty much eat it whenever I can but, this was one of the worse slices I've ever ate and it was the only slice I threw away without finishing. Also what's with the substandard ingredients? Having Kraft \"Parmesan\" instead of the real stuff is just bad.   Finally, anyone that claims this is anywhere close to New York style or any pizzeria on the East Coast is fooling themselves. In NYC you can get a slice for the price of a bus/train fare. Here it's somehow more expensive and it's way worse.",

The gentleman on the phone said it would be about 20-25 minutes. My wife went to go get it and it wasn't done. My wife was there for over 40 mins waiting. No one could find our order or anything. They kept making food and serving other before ours.. I called to see what was going on, the first person transferred me to a manager after I explained the situation. The manager on the phone was rude, I was not. I just asked what was the issue. He asked if my wife was still there to speak with and I said yes she should be in front of you and he was like well there's a computer in front of me... they didn't want to remake our wings that have been sitting there for almost an hour and had to remake a pizza for us. We just took our money back and left. Never had an issue dining in but Very disappointing experience, especially with the unprofessional manner of the \"manager\" I will never go to this location again.",

Venezia's does NY style right, with a consistency that has yet to disappoint.  The menu offers a nice variety, touting the usual toppings and pizza variations (calzones, stromboli, etc.). Add to that tasty salads, wings, and sandwiches made with Boarshead meats.  Their combo specials make Venezia's an affordable lunch option. For the carnivores, go on Wednesdays to try out my personal favorite, the Italian Stallion. Otherwise, the Greek salad is also delicious.   The fountain and tea offerings are abundant. TVs are tuned in to sports channels. The staff is friendly and the seating is generous:  booths and tables with a handful of larger booths for parties of 4+. Lunch is busy, but I've never found myself without a place to sit. Venezia's is situated in a strip mall with limited seating outside and plenty of parking.",

    "text": "I've had up and down experiences with Venezias. It has potential to be one of the best NY style pizza places I've reviewed, but I've had a few disappointing experiences among my handful of visits.   If you're coming into Venezia's, you have to come for the slices. The extra-long slices exemplify what a good NY pizza is all about. The most impressive part of this pizza is the crust, which is crispy and chewy at the same time. The strength in the crust means it can hold up easily and maintain foldability even in those extra-long slices. Venezia's keeps the crust appropriately thin, which makes the gluten strength even more impressive. Even though it has a good textured bite, it isn't dry or rigid. Though it doesn't always jump out at you with flavor, this is a pizza crust done well with really well developed structure and cooked just right.   The sauce brings a subtle all-around blend of flavors where nothing really dominates. There's sweetness, garlic, and a really understated spiciness that balances non-offensively. It's a very serviceable sauce. It won't knock your socks off but it does exactly what it needs to do. The pizza is topped with a good ratio of cheese, almost bordering on too much but usually within acceptable limits. Every pizza I've eaten has had really good brown spotting you look for in a NY slice.   I've also ordered carry-out whole pies and I don't think I would recommend this. The features of the crust that I really enjoyed disappear when you put it into a box. I'm guessing the heat and steam from the pizza get trapped and kind of soften everything down. The resulting slice is still pretty good, but it is noticeably worse than the in-person extra-large slices. There's nothing too special about the sauce and the cheese distribution can err on heavy handedness and the formation of the dreaded cheese blanket.   Perhaps the slices gave me high expectations that are not easily matched. I'm not sure if it has to do with ordering smaller sizes, but I've yet to have a whole delivery pizza I liked as much as the individual portions, especially at the price. For delivery, I might just save the extra money and get Dominos. For slices, Venezia's is hard to beat.",

The last visit, we attempted to order three things on the menu and we were told they no longer made those.  In one instance, we were told the item had not been on the menu in months.  This was told to us in a rude manner even as we indicated where it was on the menu board above us!  In fact, every item we requested was \"not on the menu anymore,\" even though we were looking at it on the board AND in the paper menu.  We came to get some sort of tray of baked pasta because we were having a family dinner and we left with a tray of ziti with some nasty, dry meatballs on it without any cheese or anything.  They packed it up with a side of sauce that was barely enough for 1-2 people for a whole tray of pasta.    The only thing good was the garlic bread.  For the price, this was not good.  We paid more than five times what it would have cost if we made this at home... and if we'd known we were just getting plain pasta... we would have boiled the water ourselves.  Their pizza has gone downhill recently, too.  I won't likely be ordering from Venezia's again.",

I don't really like when restaurants have to incessantly reference some TV show they've been on (in this case Breaking Bad and some Food Network show or something); it's tacky. Venezia's does this with all the style of a brat who just won the spelling bee. Once again, it's pretty simple pizza, not some place you really need to visit for its gourmet fare or its ability to make you be able to manufacture meth.  Their slices are a nice size and look pretty good for 2.50 a pop, though I'm not sure if that's just cheese or the ones they have featured in the display case up front.  Customer service seems okay. Check this place out if you want NY-style pizza, I reckon.",

She gave me the WORST attitude when we asked if there was anything she recommended. Her attitude was so bad it would have earned them a one star review, honestly, but a lovely young lady I think her name was Maresa overheard and she recommended I try the Italian fries with fresh jalapenos added! IT WAS AMAZING! She was so friendly and helpful! I wanted to commend her to the managers but we forgot on our way out! If they see this she deserves a raise!! Completely changed my experience!   Order the Italian fries! (With jalapenos for a kick!)",

Plenty of toppings and a great crust. I had fresh jalapenos on mine and I promise they brought the heat. I'm also not going to lie, but I ate leftovers of the pizza over the next couple of days and I think it got better with time (don't judge). This is a solid pizza joint.",

    "text": "4.5*   We used to go to Venezia's when we lived in Chandler, their thin crust pizza reminds us quite a bit of \"NY fold\" slices, which are remarkably difficult to come by in AZ. When planning for Scott's 50th Birthday, he wanted pizza. So, I contacted AJ the GM at this location to see if they would deliver a catering order; he got back to me via email and phone by first thing the next morning.   We stopped in to this location during late lunch and sat down with AJ to discuss our needs:  1) food for 25 people.  B) I over order and overcook, always.  3) we are from NY: no Ranch with pizza. Ever (no wings either. They are separate things!) D) suggestions for popular items.   AJ suggested their extra large (24\") pizzas cut square style, and we went with pepperoni, supreme, 1/2 white & 1/2 Margarita, and chicken pesto. We also ordered an antipasto salad, Greek salad, two trays of meatballs, and two orders of cheesy breadsticks. AJ emailed me a copy of the receipt and advised that we could change order up till 6PM the day of party. He was very responsive to my queries and changes, super nice guy!   Mat the delivery driver texted me when he was on the way, and brought the aforementioned, along with serving spoons, two bottles of dressing, grated cheese and red pepper flakes, and plates with extra plastic cutlery. He was very polite and professional.   All of our guests loved the food: those who have had Venezia's before were pumped, and newbies were raving. 1/3 of our guests are also native NYers, and agreed with the thin crust being the bees knees.   AJ went above and beyond to assure me I'd ordered enough food, kept in touch, provided bomb food, and followed up today to see how the party went. It went perfectly thanks to the great food and service from Venezia's, and we will definitely visit again, sooner than later. Keto be damned: that chicken pesto pizza is terrific! Their sausage crumbles are spicy and delicious, and filled-to-order cannoli are great too. We are absolute fans!",

I placed the same order as last time but this time over phone instead of online. I experienced extremely polite staff and a quick and easy ordering process. The food was delivered in 30 minutes.   See attached photos. The pizza was hot and delicious and the crust truly reminds you of a good NY slice. This time there was plenty of toppings and they were evenly spread so every slice was covered.   The wings were the main reason for my poor review last time, this time they won me over. Ownership recommended that I order the wings with the sauce on the side so they remain crispy during delivery. Well I took is advice and sure enough, they came crispy. They were pretty damn good too. Word to wise - Order your wings with the sauce on the side - especially during peek busy hours.   Venezia's won us back as customers. Way better than the PH and PJ chains. Check them out and let me know how it goes!",

The customer service is always as good as the pizza (but the pizza is definitely better). I recommend Venezia's to everyone, also their GF pizza is one of the best I've had!   The tempe location is the best for dining in as well. More than enough TVs for sports no matter the season!   Although they are always well staffed, I recommend calling ahead of time to place your order so your wait time isn't long!   Do not forget the ranch!!!!! Their \"made-in-house\" buttermilk ranch is simply the topping on the pie! But the bottle is you're a ranch lover (you'll thank me later)",

    "text": "I was surprised at how bad the pizza was. I've seen yelp give good reviews to pizza places before that I wasn't wild about but those places weren't bad they just weren't great. This one is an exception. I went in for 2 slices. The first being a white sauce slice...now I'm not exaggerating, I literally had to smell my shirt and arm to make sure I wasn't losing my sense of smell. I couldn't really taste anything I mean it had sliced tomatoes on it and I couldn't real even taste them. It was mega bland, like a white rice and unflavored chicken kinda bland. But I was like well maybe white sauce just isn't their thing.  So I bite my pepperoni slice and I'm like ah I didn't lose my sense of smell. The second slice was like flavor country after such a bland slice. But then I was like man this is kinda dry, the cheese also does not have much flavor, pepperonis are kinda meh. Does this even have pizza sauce?   I went to this place starving it should have been great, even with a heightened sense of smell and taste it was bland and dry. I don't even want to imagine what it's like in a semi fed state.   Little Cesar's is average to me. This isn't even as good as that. Why spend 5 bucks on this when I can get a whole pizza for the same price that actually tastes better? Can't speak for the rest of the menu but the pizza is really sub par. Can't understand the high marks it has. Maybe it's better as a fresh whole pizza? Maybe?",

We ordered a slice of pesto, slice of peperoni, slice of mushroom, and a slice of cheese. When the order was read back, I corrected the cashier, and thought she corrected. I will say that the eye roll when I said the order was incorrect was a bit much.  When the food came out, it was not corrected. My child will only eat cheese, so no cheese was an issue. The couter person did rush us a cheese slice for us, which was very much appreciated. I found the pesto to have a lot more oil/grease than usual. The peperoni was pretty much well done. Nothing tasted fresh...  The one redeaming item was that the antipasta salad was excellent. I have never had a bad salad from there.  I do love that they updated the dining room with more seating!",

I headed over there at the 30 min mark figuring I would go for the later time so I wouldn't have to physically wait long.  As I entered the restaurant I was about to get in line when the cashier mentioned that she could help me at her register (having me avoid walking through the line.  how nice of her!)  I was thanking her as I was walking towards her and she raised her voice at me and said \"I can't hear you from over there.\" Ok jeeze lady you didn't have to respond so rudely and so loudly.  I admit that I can be a bit shy and quiet when I'm talking, but all I was doing was thanking her.  Even if she didn't hear my thank you, she shouldn't have been rude to me and raised her voice.  She could have waited the extra 5 seconds it took me to walk over to her and then ask me calmly to repeat what I said. I then paid for the to-go order, was told it wasn't ready yet, and sat down and waited.  After sitting there for a while I realized it was a total of 45 minutes and the pizza still wasn't ready.   I walked up to the counter again to ask how much longer the wait would be, and before I even got to finish my question the same lady interrupted me and said \"WHAT'S THE NAME UNDER.\"  At this point I was already upset at the poor and rude customer service I was receiving, but I didn't want to cause a scene.  I politely waited an additional 10 minutes before the order was finally done and dashed out of here without any other words exchanged because I knew she wasn't worth my time. I understand that they can be busy over the weekends, but there is no reason to be rude and short with customers.  If you can't handle the rush of busy restaurant, then you shouldn't work in customer service.   I would have rated it a 1 star, but their pizza was good.  And kept well enough for oven reheating the next day.  But I don't think I'll be going back due to the treatment I received from the employee.",

    "text": "I was first introduced to Venezia's years ago when I started working at a new job in Tempe. It was the team's every-Friday lunch destination and it was kind of a big deal *every* Friday.  Having grown up in New Jersey, I was skeptical at first. I've yet to find a pizzeria that truly matches the \"New York style\" they claim to live up to, and I've been looking!  The minute I walked through the front door, I knew that Venezia's was going to get me very close to that holy grail I'd been searching for.  They had pizza-by-the-slice, the slices were obnoxiously large, thin-crusted, and soggy with grease. This was about all I needed to see. The first bite confirmed my hopes.  Venezia's has been my #1 go-to for pizza ever since. Unfortunately, there must be something wrong with my body, because I feel sick after eating here *every* time.  **To put the quality of Venezia's pizza into perspective for you, though, I make the conscious decision to order here even *knowing* that it will make me feel unwell!  Any other business would lose a star for \"making me feel sick afterward\", but not Venezia's. I don't blame them, and it doesn't stop me from eating here.  If you haven't been, GO! It's the closest you'll get to an authentic NY-style pizza this far south and west. Careful, though - portions are much larger than you might expect!  ;)",

He argued with me over a stupid coupon code and then laughed when i became so frustrated that i told him to forget it. I went down and spoke with Matthew who took care of the entire issue. He was very kind and respectful and all the while Joel was being loud and obnoxious holding up the line just talking to 3 men at the register while the line was to the door. Joel has no business in an establishment such as this and they should definitly reconsider even contemplating promoting this individual to management. H will cost them money and customers.

The mix of sauces cheese and topping have a full flavor in every bite. The calzone has good flavor. The mix of cheese in the calzone could use more ricotta.  Overall a great place with good flavors.",

For me the crust is a make it or break for pizza since toppings can be very similar restaurant to restaurant. It's full of flavor with just the right amount of sauce that is great. The crust is thin and crispy but not so much were if you fold the pizza it's going to break in half.  My personal favorite is the chicken pesto since it's overloaded with chicken.    While this is a pizza place their wings and calzones are also worth a try.",

I ordered a medium pie and wings last night and the pie as usual lived up to expectations. I did order the wings extra crispy and they fell well short of even regular crispy. It as like a wet Cheetos and that's not OK. Usually they do a good job on that but this time they fell short. Their consistency to provide a solid array of food keeps them atop my list in the area, just make sure you emphasize that you want your wings cooked a certain way.",

What I got was a finely crafted New York style pizza, and yes, you could fold the rather large slice over and eat it like New Yorkers do. The toppings were generous and evenly distributed. The crust was soft and thin not chewy. It had a nice tasting sauce that worked well with the toppings. The pizza could have had a little more cheese to suit me. I will be ordering this pizza in the future if not dining in at the restaurant.",

I don't want to add my personal information to this review.   I come here all the time or order all the time. I love this place. I know this isn't your fault but DoorDash orders always seem to be f'd up. The food is always sitting there forever before it's picked up. I'm more than happy to adjust this review but I do think you guys need to reach out to DoorDash and get them to improve. If there's no enough drivers to deliver the food in a timely manner then they need to not allow orders or let customers know so we can order directly from you. I'll never order Venezia's From them again but I know if I experience this all the time then others do to",

For $20 with 2 drinks ok not too shabby. I have to be honest, it's not the best. The sauce is not cooked long enough, and something on the pizza whether it was the sauce or meatballs had way too much oregano. Not really impressed since we drove all the way down here from uptown Phoenix craving some good pizza. The cheese and crust was good so no complaints there. The fact they have a sign for \"cauliflower crust\" just annoys me. This is a PIZZA joint. If you were to walk into a NY pizza place asking for cauliflower crust they would laugh in your face.......",

He tried to order me the antipasto salad (that I always get) and she told him we don't have that here! So he ended up just buying me the tiny garden side salad. When he got home and informed me of this I called to see if they were perhaps out, and I was told by the employee (a male) who answered the phone that they were not out. Not sure why this employee is telling customers they don't have things there that they clearly sell. Also, to top it off, there was a long hair (medium brown in color) first bite into his wing.",

The pizzas are made with the toppings on them, unlike some other slices places. Great lunch specials for huge slices with salad or wings to mix it up. The wings are hotter than normal. If you normally get medium, get mild, if you normally get hot you may want to get medium, if you don't want tingling lips after lunch. I wish they had coke products but other than that this is a perfect spot for lunch any day of the week. It does get busy at lunch time but they're used to it and orders come out pretty quickly. If you order anything hot that isn't pizza be prepared to wait a little bit longer, they even have a sign that says so. Tvs to watch sports are nice too.",

However the other night I was craving some wings and decided to try theirs. It was a huge disappointment. The sauce was very flavor full, but the wings were lacking. In fact, it was like they gave me just the bones. So sadly, I would recommenced staying away from the wings.  I do like their pizza. Its tasty and they have some interesting ideas. I had the Greek Salad pizza which was pretty good.   The pizza is worth getting, but not sure about the wings or other items (I haven't tried anything else). I do like how they have online ordering which is always a plus!",

However, this time I got my delivery and was not too impressed. I ordered a salad, which was opened and spilled in the bag it came in and didn't come with the dressing. Everything else was pretty good and the food tastes very good!!   I was just taken back by the person who delivered my food. The issue was he couldn't find my apartment so I answered his phone call and tried to direct him in the right direction. I decided to step outside to see where he was. Well he was right in front of my place so I went and got my food from him. He was very rude and argued with me on why I wasn't more clear of where I live. I guess I should have been, but the directions I gave were pretty descriptive.   All in all, I was just very disappointed in the service. I guess next time I'll be picking up the food instead of getting delivery.",

Yay choices!  Pizza is the same.  I thought my slice was smaller than what I'm used to, but since I don't have a side-by-side comparison...well, can't really be sure.  It wasn't enough of a difference to really matter, just something I noticed because I'm watching portion sizes.  And yes, dieting sucks.  All in all, I enjoyed my lunch.

It is a little crunchy on the outside, but with a bit of chewiness in the middle. This makes for the perfect bite. The toppings are great and every once in a while they introduce something new. Once you eat Venezia's, it gets much harder to eat at the big national chains.  They also have calzone's and wings. The calzones can get a little soggy, but the wings are good.",

    "text": "I really like this Pizza place so I'm really upset that I feel like I need to write this review... I hate writing negative reviews but I feel like this is the only way I'm going to get a resolution.  Last night at about 8:45pm my boyfriend had finally gotten home from a long day of running errands so we decided to order in. We ordered using GrubHub which I don't think that has anything to do with the negative experience. GrubHub informed me that the restaurant would stop taking delivery orders at 9:45pm and I ordered at 8:50ish.  I ordered two separate 1/2 orders of wings because I wanted all wings and he wanted a mix of both wings and drums. He also wanted different sauce than me. We also ordered the mac n cheese bites.   The order was delivered within about an hour which is pretty normal when you order extra crispy wings but when I got the order and took it out of the bag is when we had the issue. The first thing I pulled out was the mac n cheese bites. There were only about 4 or 5 tiny chicken nugget looking pieces... actually they were smaller than chicken nuggets but what made me even more frustrated was that they were in a paper basket with no lid on top. They were just thrown in with a bunch of napkins on top instead of a lid. It almost looked like they took a dine in order of the bites and threw them in a to-go bag with little to no care. They were gross too. I set those aside and pulled out another box. This was an actual \"to go box.\" when I opened it up the wings were naked with sauce on the side as requested, but there were 7 wings in the box, 4 were wings and 2 were drums. I figured that these were my boyfriends since he wanted a 1/2 order with both wings and drums. Well, I realized that... that was the only box of wings that we received. Just one box of 7 wings and the mac n cheese bites. I did not receive my order at all. I went to call the restaurant to let them know they forgot an order, but by the time we got our order, they were already closed for the night and didn't open until today at 10:30am. I called at around 11:30 to tell a manager about my experience the night before, but I was placed on hold and nobody came back on the line. I'm not going to mention the employees name because I am not wanting to get that person in trouble, they didn't do anything wrong. I really wanted to resolve this over the phone instead of writing the review... but if the manager would have just come to the phone and not kept me on hold forever... we wouldn't be here. I was charged 30 dollars for 7 wings and like 5 small mac n cheese bites. So my boyfriend and I had like 3 wings each for dinner last night, we threw the bites out because they were disgusting and cold. Unacceptable in my opinion. I'm sorry if my order was the last of the night and you all wanted to just go home... but if you don't want to make and deliver food that late, don't allow orders that late. It was lazy and careless.",

I think what defines this place is the variety of lunch specials around $6.  Oh yeah, did I mention the enormous pizza slices?  I usually rock the 1 slice and 6 boneless chicken wings combo and I struggle to finish it all.  The wings are decent but the chicken and pesto pizza is phenomenal, I highly recommend it.  If you're not in the mood for that, there are a variety of slices to choose from.  I'm confident you can find something you like as they have it all.  I've never had the calzones but I hear they're very good (and large) as well.  My only complaint was that prior to them remodeling, it was a bit cramped in there but since they've now expanded, it's a great place to come to for a fast, cheap and good pizza slice.  Good stuff!",

I usually order them in HOT. I thought by reading the menu that the wings would be really hot, but I was surprised how comfortably hot they were. There was no hesitation when eating them.

The crust seemed to have corn starch or excessive flour on it creating a paste in my mouth with many bites.

I recommend pairing your slice(s) with some wings or a salad because they have both and they compliment the pizza well.

The slices were huge, there was always a huge selection of pizzas on display, and the wings were great.  But after about a year of going there, I kid you not, weekly, I started to see a drop in standard.  The pizzas weren't always warm, if you asked for say a mushroom slice, be prepared to get canned mushroom thrown on a reheated cheese slice.  The wings weren't always warm either, and sometimes lacked the sauce that once made these wings great.  Recently, I've noticed that they've gotten rid of the punch cards (I guess not many people were using them anyway), and my favorite honey-hot wings.  Instead, I was told that I could get honey-mild wings, or get hot wings and pay for a side of honey.  I'm going to stop myself here before I go on a rant, but that drove me over the edge and well, the only reason I'll be stopping by in the future, is out of nostalgia of the place this used to be.",

I have been going to this pizza place since it's opened on this corner. I go at least 2 times a week and the last 6 months the little rats can't get it right. I only ask for whatever pizza is out and boneless mild bbq wings. Every time for years! You have the sauce in the menu yet no one every knows what the hell it is and you always give me bone in ALWAYS! I THIBK THEY THINK I WANT FREE FOOD AS MUCH AS THEY FUCK IT UP.  Honestly I don't care about free or not I just want what I want I paid for it! I hate them they ruin to many of my 15 hour work days with this foolishness! Bye forever guess I will have to go back to Slices were there are no wings and better pizza choices.",

    "text": "Pizza and I have a long standing love affair. Growing up in Chicago, I am definately a fan of deep dish. However, in my travels I have grown to love many of the different types of pizza made in this great country. As a result, I've had some horrible pizza and some pizza that would make you smack your grandma.   When I stumbled upon Venezia's last year, I was skeptical. I've grown very picky over the years and was having a hard time finding pizza in tempe. So I did a random google search for pizza in Tempe and came across venezia's. Since then, my family has had a torrid love affiar with this wonderful establishment.  Their pizza is awesome. The crust is always perfect and the sauce isn't too sweet. They do tend to go a little heavy on the cheese at times but it doesn't seem like overkill. Their calzones, wings and cheese bread are also delicious. We tried some of their desserts last time and they were great.  The service here is wonderful. I love a place that I can order online. Nothing stinks more than having to repeat yourself 15 times to the person on the other line who is standing in the loud pizza shop. The food always comes hot and fresh. They actually have cheese and peppers with them which is always nice.  Their prices are great too. Perfect for something that tastes so wonderful.",

If I am paying $9.00 for wings I would have expected them to have \"honey mild\" sauce on them, not a big side of honey for me to dip them in, so nasty. I called and asked if that was how they were normally made and typically the sauce is on the wings unless requested otherwise, anyways   the girl on the phone didn't apologize didn't offer to fix them, just told me to dump the honey on top. Not a good first experience and definitely will never go back.",

Pizza: Good, better than most places.  Slightly greasy but that is the kind of pizza this is.  Wings: Awesome!  Love the crispy (no breading!!  Yay!) skin and their sauces are premium.  I especially like that when I order the Honey Hot they send the honey in a separate container.  Might just be me, but I think they taste better with the honey added right before eating.

What they knew, and I had the pleasure of finding out today, was that you CAN get a damn good lunch for under $6! Their special consisting of 2 huge one-topping slices and a drink was just right...I left fully satisfied and full, without that \"I just swallowed a brick\" feeling. I definitely intend to make this a regular weekly lunch spot, keep up the good work guys!  **UPDATE** I just need to make a quick addition to my review here, I have recently fallen in love with their chicken pesto pizza, oh my, this stuff is AMAZING. Granted, 6 hours later when you burp you'll taste it all over again (and my friend's wife doesn't appreciate the garlic breath that results from these slices), but it's a sacrifice well worth making. Also, even though they charge extra for a side of ranch, it's a necessity for dipping and a perfect compliment to their crust.",

In the $5-6 range you can get 2 1 topping slices and a drink, 1 slice and a salad or 1 slice and some wings.  They even have a student special for 1 slice and a drink for like $3.65.  Nice.    I wasn't lying about the size of the pizza.  I measured - longer than my wrist to my elbow.  About as wide at the top as my hand from finger to tip of wrist.  Will this be the same for everyone?  Um, duh - no.  BUT I'm not obscenely small or funky shaped so you can trust me that this is a huge piece of pizza.    The place is cool.  Seating outside on the covered strip-mall strip watching folks walk out of LA Fitness nearby or inside.  During a packed lunch good luck finding a table.  It can happen, but you have to be like a hawk and swoop on in quickly.    Hint - if you want to shock and amaze your friends - get their 24\" Party Pizza.  Heck, get more than one.  The boxes alone will shock people.  Huge huge pizza.",

The lunch specials are great as well, 2 HUGE slices and a soda for about $5.  They use Boar's Head Cold Cuts, which are THE best you can use.  No cheap crap here.

I went in person to place a to-go order and the place was really busy - it was filled with people sitting down to eat, waiting for to pick-up a phone order, and placing to-go orders. The woman who took my order was still really friendly and patient, despite how busy it was. I ordered a large one-topping pizza ($10.50 with a coupon I found in the paper menu sitting on the counter), a dozen Honey Hot boneless wings ($7.99), and a small salad ($2.99). The wait was 20-25 minutes but the woman was upfront about how long it would be, and the food was definitely worth the wait!  The pizza was really good - tomato sauce that was savory, not sweet, the right amount of real mozzarella, and a crust that was the perfect combination of crunchy and chewy. The wings weren't the best I've ever had, but they used good-quality chicken and had a pretty flavorful sauce. The salad was also pretty good, with fresh lettuce and pepperoncinis. A lot of pizza places skimp on the salad, but this was a decent side salad for ~$3.   Venezia's is a great place to get good-quality NY pizza and sides. They deliver, but I'm not sure how far they'll go. Definitely worth checking out if you're in the area.",

I love it here, you can't go wrong with either a slice combo with wings or a salad, or ordering an entire party sized pizza for a pizza party.

I am so glad I decided to stop by, which I did twice. I literally eat a slice 4 times a wk in Brooklyn, but I couldn't stop thinking about another slice at Venezia's. They are huge!  The decor is awesome, very large back room. Loved the music which is classic rock (great), and the happy hour. Everyone there was so nice.  I am looking forward to going again to Arizona just for another slice of Venezia's. Take it from a native Brooklynite this pizza is as good as it gets! I think they ruined my everyday slices for me. Try it, you will be very glad you did.",

Puzzles me why your comparing a eat-in coal fired pizza in Scottsdale with a more casual slice place like Venezias. The two serve completely different categories in my opinion. A more fair comparison would be the nearby Slice's or Sal's pizza which Venezia's blows away.  A lunchtime/gameday staple",

The one thing I feel they could improve on is being more conscious of the disposal of plastic that is used and discarded by their customers.  Looks like it just goes into the trash and truly this is not necessary.  Recycling is the way to go and not that difficult.  Sends a great message too!",

That was no problem since we weren't in any rush to eat. It was a fairly expensive order, over $50 for 2 small pizzas and a salad. Our delivery driver was waiting to pick up our order for over 45 minutes, he called us a couple times to let us know that the restaurant was running behind on our order. After he waited over 30 minutes they let him know that they had sent out our order with their delivery driver instead and they had to completely remake our order and we would have to continue to wait. Thankfully our DoorDash driver kept us updated throughout the whole process and it was clearly a complete fail on Venezia's end. Venezias told the driver that they took $10 off our bill but I still have yet to see that change made on my bank statement. The pizza is good but definitely not worth the expensive price tag and the hassle it took to get our order, I felt horrible for our poor delivery driver. We'll see if that $10 reduction ever comes through but I kind of doubt it will. If you like super slow pizza for an expensive price this place is for you, if not, look elsewhere.",

We currently live in Orlando FL, but are originally from NJ so finding good pizza is hard in the south.  We were skeptical having been our first time in Phoenix.  We were pleasantly surprised and delighted by the pizza and the subs.  We ordered a slice to taste along with a sub for the football game and we absolutely loved it.  Loved it so much we went back the next day and got another slice and tried another sub for the plane ride home!  Staff was friendly and the food came out quickly.  The atmosphere was great in the restaurant, reminded us of the Pizza joints we had growing up in NJ.  Highly recommend it if you are in town and just looking for some good Italian food.",

I called to place to order for pick up and i saw a coupon for a large 1 item with 2 orders of boneless wings  . Joel tells me he couldn't find that coupon and asks me for the code . I provided the code and he said that code is for a large not xtra large. That's what i told him but rather than argue i went along with it . I just wanted to pick up the pizza and go home .  I asked if the boneless can be upgraded and that i was Willing to pay the upcharge . He said that they can't do it . I told him they've done it before . He said my last order was boneless  and he's the manager and can see my whole order history . I let him know that I've been order from atleast 10 years and I've never had any issues with changing them to boneless . I let him know that his condescending attitude just cost them a loyal customer . I know my little $70 a month won't make a difference but i don't need the hassle .",

The wings are inconsistent, sometimes really good, sometimes yuck. It's the kind of place that if I don't feel like driving into Gilbert Pizza, I'll order from Venezia's or Barro's.  They have online ordering, which is awesome. They are local, and overall, they are pretty good.  I've also had the chicken parm, which I often crave in general. It's good. I wish they wrapped it in butcher paper rather than styrofoam, but it's good.",

I ordered a thin crust personal pizza for myself, as I like veggie and my family likes meat. It came out burned, and I did not realize until I got home. I called and spoke to the manager, who disclosed that the person who took the order accidentally asked for it to be well done. He offered to credit my account, and send another pizza out to my house. I was delighted, until the second pizza arrived in exactly the same burned state. Not sure what else I need to say in order to get a pizza that is not burned on the crust and well done on top. Too bad. Now I have two inedible pizzas. Maybe I just need to order regular crust, as the other pizza came out fine.",

    "text": "I have come here in the past for dine in and have gotten individual slices of pizza. Slices have been pretty tasty at a low price. I like the environment. Last time we got one of those HUGE whole pizzas to go, extra sauce. Sauce was not really flavorful and the toppings were ok. The slices were abnormally larger than the already LARGE individual slices so it was really hard to handle the slices. Plates not big enough for slices so a portion the pizza is touching the table. Its not cut all the was thru in the box so you have to recut with your pizza slicer and the box is already soggy from the toppings and sauce so we ended up cutting all the way through the box. It was just an awkward experience and I don't think I would ever order this huge pizza again, even though I am more than willing to go back for the individual slices. It was an experience non the less and I can definitely cross this off my bucket list. They are probably one of the best places for individual sliced pizzas as far as variety and value but only order the massive pie if you know what you're getting into. Enjoy.",

When we went into the restaurant to pickup our food the cashier said that she could not find it in the system. She apologized and told us she would grab the manager. The manager came over apologized and put our order back in. He also gave us a discount and still honored our coupon. I was so impressed how this situation was handled. Both the manager and cashier were so great. I work in the restaurant business and understand mistakes happen. I felt this situation was handled perfectly! When we got back home we ate the pizza and loved it! I was impressed at the service and food at Venezia's. We will be back and have recommended it to other friends!",

The last two times I have ordered, once was for delivery; the other was store pick-up.    Its a battle of pizza in Tempe, and when i spend almost 20 bucks for a pizza; I expect it to be pretty tasty.  The delivered pizza was not, in both sauce and toppings, it was nothing spectacular; and the delivery took almost an hr. Which, might of contributed to the pizza not being very good.  My most recent pizza, was in my assuming that a picked up pizza would be fresh and better than my delivery was. I was wrong; the white pizza (no sauce, olive oil and ricotta,) was possibly worse than the delivery. And, for 20 bucks I could of gotten 2 pizzas at jamies pizzeria in the neighborhood that I KNOW would of been better than this.    Oh well, I don't know if their expansion has led to the quality going down, or that the place has many different locations now and as such whatever was special is no longer so, but its very obvious to me that whatever I thought was SO GOOD about venezias prior, is not. And I won't be trying it again.",

    "text": "Ugh! I took a friends recommendation, unfortunately. This is NOT good pizza, I have no clue how this has 4 stars on yelp. I am assuming cause it is in Tempe (a college town).  We ordered a 16\" half pizza blanco - half supreme.  First, the Pizza Blanco - It was bland and they said it was fresh cheese, well, I don't know how. There was nothing to it, I had to add every spice at the table to get anything out of it and didn't eat a whole piece. Then, the supreme - This was slightly more edible, but I promise you, if I closed my eyes, I would think I was eating a supreme pizza from Costco. Again, the cheese was NOT fresh or at least not fresh and of quality. Then the crust, I didn't eat it, I ate the toppings of the supreme only, because it was flavorless had no depth or crunch at all. And I only ate it because i was hungry. The service is sub par and don't expect them to go out of your way or seem happy to serve you.  Now, if you are like a lot of these reviewers, you might like it. But if you like quality good food with flavor and depth, and don't eat pizza and empty calories without thinking about it, you will thank me that you skipped this place.  This is simply not good food, not good quality and not a True representation of good New York style pizza.",

They have something like 8 different slice combos: some with one slice and a salad, some with a slice and wings, two slices, one gourmet slice and a salad, etc. Every meal comes with a drink. And the prices are fantastic! $3.50 for a slice and soda, and the slices are huge! I usually can't even finish a slice. $5.50 or so for 2 slices and a soda. About the same for a slice and a salad. I mean, really, you can't get much better than that! And their pizza is pretty close to perfect. I'm a fan of their sausage, their pepperoni and their meat combo. The veggie pizza got rave reviews from my partner, and she loves their salad!   If you're not a fan of the college crowd, this may not be the best spot for you, especially on a Friday or Saturday night (it is close to ASU after all). But if you don't mind the noise volume being slightly on the high side, then do yourselves a favour and swing by and get a slice!",

They have the best part of NY style pizza right there on the counter: The Shakies, all the goodies that you can shake on top. I'm a Garlic Powder, Parmesan, Red Pepper guy myself. I hate when a shop says it's NY style and has no shakies, that's part of the style, go to NYC and you'll see. If you get the slice special, you won't be eating for awhile, good deal for the money you pay. O and they have wings, mmmm, god-like wings made the right way with Frank's Red Hot.  The only reason that I cannot give Venazia's 5 stars is because of a couple bad delivery experiences. The last time I waited an hour and 15 minutes before calling to check my status. The owner(Brian?) answered and explained that I had called back and said that i was picking it up instead( o, really?). I asked him why he didn't call after the order sat over an hour, plus the fact that whenever I call they already have my number, so a different number would have called and no one on this earth knew I ordered anyways. He didn't seem to care either way, which is bad customer service, especially for a loyal customer. So I felt kind of slighted. But I won't let that stop me from eating their great food, I only eat-in now  :D",

If you are someone like me who is over the age of 25 and is interested in finding a great pizzeria and craves NY style pizza then this review is for you.  The pizza is good but disappointing. There are better NY style pizzerias in the valley....much better... Rays, Gus', Jimmy and Joe's Pizza. The pizza has a lot of yeast so you feel full after two slices.  The yeast also takes away from the flavor.  The cheese lacks flavor and tastes as if there is little salt in it. The meat toppings such as their Italian sausage is small and has little flavor. They advertise as if they are an authentic Sicilian style pizzeria but it honestly tastes like imitation NY style pizza.   I would strongly suggest not ordering their 12 inch pizzas. They won't feed 2 people and are basically slightly larger than a personal pizza.  Go with the 16 inch.  About the pizzeria itself....Yes, you can eat there but this joint should be viewed as a carry-out only place. The only people eating there are teenagers or college students who are grabbing a bite to eat before they go out or after they come back from the bars. So unless you fit into one of those two demographics, get the pizza to go.",

Everytime I walk in I am greeted with a smile, and Everytime I have friends in from out town, Venezias is a must. If you haven't been here, make sure you try it some time. My favorites from here are the wings, sausage slices, and the greek salad. The only thing I have bad to say is that they charge for ranch, but even the ranch is worth it.",

    "text": "I love pizza. Always have, always will. I am definitely in the category that believes it is good, even when it is bad. This place became a regular spot for me in high school and I have been going ever since. The slice special is the most bang for your buck you could hope for in a place like this. For just over 5 bucks you get 2 BIG slices and a drink (or a salad if you like) and given the quality I would take this over a 5 dollar large at any one of places in town that price that way. It's also been great to see the place grow over the years; and yet it has its drawbacks as well. Before they expanded, this place used first names rather than order numbers which definitely takes some of the pride out of being a long time fan. Also the demand has brought down the quality of the slices and salads, but only slightly. If you haven't been going regularly for years as I have then you probably wouldn't be able to tell. While Venezias has declined a bit, it still beats out the other popular New York style places in town like Slices on Mill. The slices tend to come out fresher whereas some of the competitors let theirs sit for just a bit too long. If you have never been, check this place out. You won't regret it, especially if you love a good slice as much as I do.",

    "text": "Tonight I found my new favorite resturant in Tempe, Venezia's.  First I had the wings which are 50 cents on Mondays and you definatly get your monies worth. Larger than average and there sauce is similar to Hooters. Very good. Next was lasagna which was average, but, again, larger than average portion size.  Plently for tomorrow and maybe the next day.  Comes with garlic bread. My son had the kids pepperoni pizza which I assumed was great because he ate the whole thing. :-) Dessert was the best part. We tried Tirimisu and Cheesecake. The Tirimisu wasn't the best I've had. I wouldn't order it again, but the Cheesecake...oh the Cheesecake. I would say it was the best Cheesecake I've ever had.  I've tried Cheesecake everywhere (i.e. Cheesecake factory, little Mom and Pop places in New York, etc)  and it is so creamy and light it literally melts in your mouth.  Plus, it's a huge piece.  Probably twice the size of what is normally served. Venezia's gets five stars because first they quoted me 45 min. and they were there in 45 min., everything was a reasonable price espicially for there larger than average portions, and, of course, the Cheesecake was amazing! I can't wait to try the pizza next!",

Combos are reasonably priced for a slice or 2 with salad or wings and a drink  Lunch is thier busiest time at this location. Sometimes the service is spotty and they always seem to be training a new employee on the register during the busier times in the evening. Once you get your order in properly, you can expect it to come out in a short amount of time. We had dreadful service one night and the manager called us personally and gave us a credit on the register to come back and eat.  Props to him!",

    "text": "I first tried this place not long before moving to Tempe. A friend of mine had constantly raved about it so when I was in the area we finally hit it up. When he told me to get the 2 slices and a drink special, I was perplexed.  \"Do you want to split an order of wings or something too?\", I asked him.  \"No, the two slices is enough food. Trust me.\"  \"Two slices? I'm a grown man, son.\"  In my stubbornness I ended up ordering some wings with the pizza. As usual, it turns out I made a mistake. When you're eating with veterans of a food establishment, listen to what they have to say. The slices showed up and they were just massive. Apparently the single serving slices come from the huge party size pizza which I'm yet to have ordered. I was full after both slices and a couple of wings, and this was despite me putting in significant effort to eat all of the wings to prove how right I was.   The pizza itself is nothing too special, but is extremely greasy with good crust. They pack the cheese on too, which is always commendable. Basically, this is really good pizza at an affordable price. You can eat two slices of pizza and get a drink for around $5-6 and can order pizzas at a price very similar to that of the large chains.  The above is why Venezia's is great. They effectively replace all of the pizza delivery chains with better pizza at a similar price AND have single cheap meals AND have good sit down areas. It's not gourmet pizza. It's probably not better than some place you wait in line to sit down in a restaurant and pay $20+ for your medium pizza. Venezia's is just delicious, affordable, convenient local pizza. That, boys and girls, is the type of place you get the most utility from. I have probably eaten here more than anywhere else since moving to Tempe with the possible exception of Haji Baba.  They also have excellent wings and some really awesome daily specials. For example, on Fridays you can buy extra large cheese pizzas at $6 each after buying one at normal price. The staff is friendly and they have fairly late hours. Oh, Don't get the Italian Stallion pizza. The description is great but it's just not that good.",

I purchase Boar's Head meats from my deli and never had anything that looked like I was served.  It was just nasty.....I threw it away because the bread absorbed the smell of the 'roast beef'.

The wings were good as well and I will certainly be back for NFL Sundays to feed my guests. Thanks to my boy Andy B. For the tip!",

Excellent if you just want to stop in and grab a slice or get a party pie (2 or 3 feet across, gigantic!) delivered to your home. They also make Sicilian pies! That is amazing in the valley, no one has Sicillian!   Their sandwiches are also great, at least the hot ones. The cold ones suffer from the problem that all cold sandwiches in the valley suffer. We just can't seem to get ham, roast beef and turkey right here in AZ. Its weird, seems easy, but there's just something off with the cold cuts in the valley.   The staff is rather young and not very experienced. There is a lot of turnover. So there are issues where you ask for a meatball parmigiana sandwich and are told that there isn't one...you have to tell them that a meatball sub and and a meatball parmigiana sandwich are the same thing.  As an east coaster I always have to remember to not order subs as heroes, as then I have to argue what is on my gyro. Because gyro is pronounced (by Greeks at diners as well) in NY with a hard 'g', largely IMHO because subs are called heroes.   Nonetheless, their delivery is great and the food is excellent! Their chicken parmigiana sub is a runner up for best in AZ!",

(that's three by my count, booyah)  This place is my \"go to\" place for pizza. The pizza is delicious and the value is excellent. They have about 10 specials that they run all day. The specials include 1 slice, 2 slices, 1 slice and 6 wings, 1 slice and a salad and much more. The specials include a fountain drink as well. Just to give you a price point I usually get the 2 slice, 1 topping special with a drink and that is $5.75 plus tax. Now when I say the value is excellent it is because the slices are colossal, They shouldn't even call them slices they should be called slabs of pizza.  I have only dined-in and the service has been pretty quick, naturally the slices will come out quicker then the wings but the service is still pretty quick. There is plenty of seating and usually sports on the televisions.  All-in-all this is a great place for the following reasons: 1. Great food: Pizza = great, Wings = decent, Salad = what is a salad? 2. Great value for the amount of food. 3. Roomy atmosphere where you can bring the entire family or a group of friends to feast on the goodness.",

I could've just as easily been satisfied by one.  I got my slices to-go, but the inside looked nice and clean.  It's a good place to grab a quick bite.   What I really like about Venezia's is that you can put whatever topping you want on a single slice of pizza, instead of having to choose from what is already made like at most other pizza places. They just put the topping of your choice on a cheese slice and pop it back into the oven.  Also, there was a nice amount of sauce on the pizza, I hate when there is no sauce!  The only sorta bad thing I noticed, which is probably to be expected when eating pizza, is that it was extremely greasy.  Even my coworkers commented on how greasy it was, but they didn't seem to care anymore once they tasted it!",

Never have I had pizza like this and I can't wait for my father to come in town so that I can take him there, after that experience I am quite sure that his visits to Phoenix will be quite more frequent. Let's break down the good, the bad and the ugly about this establishment!   The Good. They deliver quite far and when they deliver the pizza is still hot and fresh, almost like they took it out of oven, stepped in a Star Trek teleporter and knocked on your door. I got the meat lovers the first time I had them and I've been in love every since. When I took that first bite.....the way the cheeses and meats and spices all merged together and melted in my mouth.... I became mentally and foodmotionally  distressed and stood in my kitchen unsure of what to do next because the flavors just blew me away. I ended up skipping the plate and took the entire box and sat in front of the TV and snuggle ate. Which brings me to my next point...   More good news, it reheats really well the next day. Again more foodgasms to be had! The next time I had them I went and ordered dine in with a friend (the establishment is really nice!). She too was overwhelmed in a great way. I was having a bad day that day so I did what any logical thinking woman would do,  I ordered cheesecake.... again MY GOD!   Either way I've said enough! Just go...or order in at home.   Oh by the way there is no bad or ugly... Well I take that back...when they say their wings are hot... THEY ARE HOT...so use discretion but whatever happens with that is between you, your esophagus, and the porcelain Gods which may get ugly depending on what kind of relationship you have with aforementioned Gods.  5 stars from me all the way!",

    "text": "I've been coming here for eight years now and will probably keep coming until I die.   The staff cashiers are friendly and I never felt rushed ordering. Recently I was beyond impressed about how they handled overcharging me (slightly) on a beer on special. They offered to change the amount charged on my card or to just give me the difference in cash (that's actually unheard of for me). Big ups to them.   The pizza really is stellar. The only bad thing is that the quality somehow varies, but the floor and ceiling of the threshold is still very high (when it's good, it's out of this world).   I always always always suggest getting slice specials. It makes ordering a breeze and helps them with preparing pizzas to meet demand. They are very generous to when it comes to replacing older pizzas with new ones if you ask. Do your best to try the mahgarita pizza. It's very rare but it's worth it if you see it.   One final note I would like to tell about this place is its generous ambiance. I'm actually a camper which is why I frequent restaurants without a wait staff so I don't hold them up. My friends and I bring laptops and cell phone charges and just chill here for hours and we have never once been asked to leave or move or anything. The staff will sometimes engage us and ask what we are up to because they are interested. I always feel a little uneasy that I'm taking up real estate there, but they've always let me feel welcome and for that, they have me for life.",

I gave this place another try.... 1) last time I had my boyfriend pick up the food so I never had any interaction with the staff. This time I picked it up. The restaurant is homey. I actually felt comfortable walking in and asking for my food instead of feeling like a burden as so many places make you feel.  2) the actual food: margarita pizza was WAY better this time. More flavors all around. We finished the entire medium size in one sitting. :) We also ordered the \"famous meatballs\" the sauce and seasoning, again, terrific. Plus, the price isn't too bad either. An appetizer for $3.75, okay!!   I understand the other great reviews now. I'll be coming back here - next time to try the wings :)",

I saw a 4 star rating on Yelp and being only a mile away I went with Venezia's. Oh Boy! I'll never order pizza from here again. I got a large pizza with green pepper, jalapeno, pineapple and mushroom and it was not good.   1. The pizza crust is really, really salty. Very much like a pizza dough you'd buy from a grocery store.   2. There is so little sauce on the pizza that you can't even taste the sauce. It makes the pizza real dry.   3. The toppings are not all equal quantity. I order pineapple on all my pizzas because it adds sweetness. I like the contrast between the salt from the cheese and the sweet pineapple. There was so little pineapple on my pizza I could barely taste it.   4. The jalapeno's are not fresh; they are marinated or pickled. They are extremely briny it just added to the saltiness of the crust which Noneified any sweetness I could have gotten from the tiny bit of pineapple there was.  I do not recommend this pizza place. If you want to spend $17+ for a salty pizza with sparse toppings go right ahead otherwise go elsewhere.",

Second, they didn't have any coupons whatsoever for that item, which is extremely odd considering pizza places (such as Rosati's) normal send out coupons since even they know their prices are high. I happened to find a measly $4 off coupon online, which the lady still refused to accept because the order total has to be \"$30 *before* tax\"; wow, wouldn't want to put them out of business. If all of that wasn't bad enough, the dough on the pizza was practically raw, especially considering we asked for it well done; having dough stuck between your teeth isn't exactly appetizing. Venezia's, lower your prices to non-astronomical levels, offer coupons and don't be stingy because the total isn't a certain amount *before tax*, and please cook the pizzas how the customer orders them!",

    "text": "I went to this pizza place and I won't be going back. From what I can tell, from some of the Yelp responses, the owner seems to be Italian. I mean with a name like (Dominick M.) I am assuming he is Italian. But perhaps, if he weren't, it might explain why this pizza place is run the way it is. But anyway, if he comes from my home town of Chicago (not likely because no one from Chicago would ever put NY on their pizza place), or any of the East Coast Cities, like New York, Providence or Philadelphia, he has obviously lost his way. The kids he is hiring, know nothing about service, let alone pizza or the traditional neighborhood Italian pizza place. This could be forgiven, I know ASU kids come from all over the country (but provide some training, for crying out loud). But what can't be forgiven, is the way they sell pizza by the slice. When pizza is sold by the slice, it is one price across the board (with possible exception for cheese pizza). This place tries to charge $2.79 for the base cheese and sauce on the slice, plus .45 cents for each topping. Leaving one to break out the calculator, count toppings and add up what the cost of each type of pizza slice is (an absolutely ridiculous way of pricing slices). Then there is happy hour pricing, with a dollar off per slice, but that starts at 8 PM. Again ridiculous, one, because I did not see a bar in this pizza place, two, this is not the type of place I would go to drink for happy hour because they don't serve spirits. I cannot say with 100% certainty that they did not have a bar because I did not get past the bubble head working the register, who could not explain the pricing structure of pizza by the slice, before I got frustrated and walked out.  But I guess they do serve beer and wine because a sign in the window indicated that they had just gotten their B&W license. Anyway, I can't speak to the quality of the food because I did not eat there, but if it is anything like the customer service or restaurant management, I am sure I did not miss much. Serves me right for going anywhere other than Spinato's for pizza, the only place I know that serves real Chicago thin crust West of the Mississippi.",

We aren't trying to get a free pizza, just the one originally ordered. And it's there app! I'd understand if we used postmates or grub hub, we would of contacted them. This is there own app so how can you not accept responsibility for your company's product? I work in the food service industry and everytime a guest has an issue with their order it is your responsibility to give them what they pay for. I know a place as big as this isn't penny pinching. You can make an order 3 times and still make a profit. This was some young kid who was unwilling to accept his responsibility over wanting to feel like he didn't make a mistake. That's terrible mindset to have. Hey I'll say the pizza is great! Bad costumer service will turn us away for life.",

The crust could be more crisp and as crazy as it sounds a they should use less cheese. It gets greasy and that is without sausage or pepperoni.  I do go here often to carry out, but is you don't call ahead it can take more than 30 minutes to get a large cheese pie on a Friday or Saturday Night.   The dining room is very dark, which gives it a bit of a dank feel, which I suppose is more authentic to New York City, but still not a place you'd take a date, or your parents or anyone you're trying to impress.",

The atmosphere is typical of your \"new york style\" pizzerias, in my opinion.  I got a combo slice & a drink. My date got a slice of sausage pizza & a water. It was under $7 for both of us total!   I devoured the slice. It was huge and the flavor was perfect! The crust was crunchy, which I love, and of course the classic grease dripping from the slice and possibly my face! haha.  I've been back 3 times in the last 3 weeks for lunch. It's always packed and super hopping! They have great food, they're quick, and at a really good price! How can you beat that?",

I was charged for an order of wings and 2 slices of pizza and only ended up getting a half order. I don't understand how they can make a mistake when they took their time (15 minutes) getting the order together. Something which should really take like 2 minutes tops. I had forgotten to grab my drink cup and when I asked for one the girl scoffed at me. What did I do to get you so upset? Ask for what I paid for? I got home and discovered that I only received a half order of wings and on top of that the pizza was cold. I gave them the benefit of the doubt and assumed they took so damn long because they were making fresh pizza but nope. Not that at all. I even left a tip when I ordered! Will not go back to this place again. Also, how do you have 20 people working there and not be faster? It doesn't make much sense.",

    "text": "Good place for pizza, perhaps one of the best in the area. Great slice/combo specials. A slice, 6 wings, and a drink is more than enough to fill me up. The pizza is good, the staff are friendly, and even the wings are good.   I like to get the slice combos, but they don't really bake the toppings into the pizza, so they kind of fall off (unless the pizza was already cooked with the toppings). Otherwise, the crust, sauce, and cheese are all very good.  The wings are pretty amazing as well. I like honey hot is weird, its like hot but just honey on top, and its very watery, which makes the wings soggy. Weird. The mustard hot and hot are pretty good complements to a slice of pizza.  I did the party pizza challenge with a friend. Its a little tough, about 10 slices per person, but definitely doable. We weren't on drugs when we did it like some other people were, who somehow happened to finish it in 5-10 minutes. Ie, at the Tempe location, two sorority looking girls did it in 15 (they probably weighed no more than 200 lbs combined). Meanwhile, my friend and I, weighing in around 350 lbs did it in 35 minutes. Am I whining about a food contest? No, just don't try this expecting to get it done.  This place has been pretty consistent the few times I've been there. I appreciate that. I hate it when a place is awesome the first two or three times, then it drops off in quality and can be a coin flip every time you go. So far its been very consistent.  They stay well connected with their patrons on FB/twitter. I won a free slice through a contest. Free stuff is always cool. It shows that they appreciate us.  Ahh the raiting. This was close. I can't think of anything particularly special about this place. The pizza isn't special, the wings aren't special, and I haven't tried much else. However, I wouldn't hesitate to come here ever, and there are times when I get cravings for this place. There isn't much in Tempe that is close to this sorta stuff. My baby brother loves this place as well, and so does my GF. I'm sure they'll never say no if I wanted to come here, so I think that means this place deserves a 5.",

The pizza is awesome, probably some of my favorite in Tempe and definitely my favorite quick takeout pizza in the area. The wings are also really good probably right behind The Vine's in my book (yes I consider The Vine to have the best wings around Tempe). Put this together into a combo with a half dozen wings, a huge slice of pizza, and a drink all for $6 and I'm sold.   This combo is probably one of the best deals around ASU especially considering how good the food is. The cool thing about the combos here is that they're not just lunch specials so if I come at some random time or even for dinner I can still get my $6 pizza, wings, and a drink. Also, the place seems freshly remodeled and there are a bunch of TV's everywhere so it wouldn't be a bad place to grab some food and catch part of a game or something on the cheap. I really have nothing bad to say about this place at all, easily 5 stars.",

I got to my pedicure appt and began to chow down (I am on my lunch break, hence the multi-tasking) I noticed after one or two bites my chicken didn't taste right. So disappointed because I have minimal time, I called them back just to give them a heads up about their chicken and potentially save someone else from food poisoning ... The gentlemen told me how they prep the chicken so it couldn't be it that it was under cooked. He went on to look up the order, provided me a  full refund me and asked what I would like instead. I told him, one slice of pizza would suffice. Instead, he assured me he would fill my To-go order with food to equate to what I originally spent despite him comp-ing it. He asked how long I'd be and he would have it waiting for me. In today's society we hustle and bustle all day... Multitask and we are on our way... Although, it is customer service stories like these that make you take a moment and realize how rare they occur. I work out at LA fitness regularly but have never stopped in Venezia's until today... After a small gesture that truly goes a long way... I will always think of Venezia's for my pizza needs!",

The ends are just as edible, and fantastic dipped in ranch.The sauce was excellent. Plenty of cheese, but a little light on the toppings. Pizza was a little sloppy, which I don't mind, but it did required a knife and fork. They seem to have fantastic slice special that is super cheap: around 5 dollars, and they have a student special as well.  If this pizza was in any other town it would only get a 3 or 3.5 at best.  Thought it was kind of lame that they charge for ranch, especially when you are paying 17 dollars for a pizza. But no other drawbacks.  Plenty of places to sit.  They do deliver although they charge 2 dollars, and the lobby is littered with flat screen TV's for the football junkie.  Service was fine. Typical fast food type service.   Overall we left full and satisfied! We will go back.",

    "text": "I'd like to start by saying this place is hands down the best place to get pizza in the state. I'm quite the frequent flyer as I've been coming here 4 to 5 times a week for the last 8 years! And today was the day I decided to let the world know how awesome you guys truly are! There is one girl upfront in particular who inspired this review, Alex G as the receipt always says, who just blows me away everytime. She has exceptional customer service, and unfortunately that's just not as common these days. I'm normally in during the lunch rush and it never fails, she remembers my name and order. Although it's just a slice of pepperoni, salad and a drink, it's very impressive considering the amount of people that come in and out of here everyday! So shout out to you Alex G!! It may be something small but it's the small things we remember and that's what keeps me coming back, and the food of course! All of you are a very hard working group of people and I can't thank you enough for all your hard work to feed the hungry people of Tempe! Keep it up!!!",

Their food is consistently high quality and they always have enough staff on hand to make sure you order and eat quickly in a clean environment.  The prices are very reasonable and there is rarely, if ever, a reason to gripe.  Big slice and a salad for $6.50?  Okay!  Another place that I eat at on a regular basis because they've proven that they deserve my business.",

I also had a slice of the buffalo chicken, it was spicy but lacked flavor. The kids loved the pepperoni pizza & fries.... But the music was awesome every song was a hit.",

I don't love the sauce and cheese they use. And the crust while we ordered thin was thickish. As someone who grew up in New York I feel like I can be critical.

Now I know why everyone ranks them so highly.  I did order mushrooms on my pasta, but on the side. They were not great or abundant. I don't care. The pasta made up for it.  Don't expect a relaxing meal. The atmosphere here is very family and loudish and wide open. You must stand in line to order your food. They take your name. When your food is done they put it on the counter and call your name. I never heard them call my name. I'm not holding that against them in my four-star rating.  My bill for the spaghetti, two pieces of very good garlic bread, a respectable size slice of pepperoni pizza, and their largest size beverage came to $13.27 with tax.

It's a busy place and its a good thing. This shows great character to the restaurant. I felt like eating pasta so I ordered the baked ziti and my boyfriend got a single slice of pizza with a drink.   The wait didn't take long. The employee warned me itll take about 15 mins for the pasta to bake, so I had fair warning. The place feels homie with good music playing!   The food was yummy af! The pizza is \"better than your typical pizza\" and the it contained the right amount of cheese to sauce ratio with the toppings. The baked ziti was warm and having the meatball was worth the extra two bucks! I couldn't finish the dish because it was a lot of pasta but I'll be glad to take it home and bring it for lunch tomorrow.   10/10, I'd come back here again! My boyfriend loves it and so do I! The restaurant is a good place to come for some yummy pizza and italian specials. Their deals look great as well.",

Pasta with meatballs and sauce all on side - they did it - Yeay Just note they use parm cheese so for the lactose intolerant be careful. Turkey sandwich - turkey on side! - thanks for making that happen. It's tomorrow lunch and if they didn't it would be gross and soggy! Veggies - what's lunch without some veggie!  Fresh and crispy!

There's always a slice of the day, daily specials and even a reverse happy hour  Also...ask about the party pizza challenge  Only complaint is that I wish they were open later but otherwise, great spot!",

The pizza was Thin crust (how I prefer it) and the ingredients a tasted great. Sauce was just right and the cheese was not salty at all.   The wings (I got garlic parm) was amazing, delicious and Did not disappoint.   The real winner was the Italian beef. Omg It was delicious and had the right kick of spice in it. I really love this place. The first time I came was a day after taking my kids out  Last night I ordered delivery, and the food was still fresh and delicious.",

Our side of mozzarella sticks was an absolute joke that was crushed underneath the wings that we ordered. I mean who seriously put this order in the bag like \"yeah these are fine\" and put it out to go? Called the restaurant and got hung up on, waited a few minutes to see if they would call back but no such luck, had to call back myself. The manager Josh said he would issue a refund. We got a call the following night on 08/28 confirming card information for the refund but still haven't received anything.",

I ordered the xl pepperoni pizza which only came up to $17. If this were dominos a pizza this big would have easily been 30 bucks. Im amazed by how much you can get here for so cheap. I also ordered a side salad which looked more like a salad to feed an entire family, this was also very good! I like that their menu has plenty of options to choose from, there's definitely variety here. I also appreciate that if you're not in the mood for an entire pizza, you can order a single slice which is huge by the way. Pizza here easily gets 5/5   Atmosphere/Service: this place is extremely busy but honestly after tasting the food I can see why. This restaurant is extremely spacious with tons of seating & TVs everywhere playing the game! Service is also very friendly & efficient. Despite it being so busy here my food still came out super fast. Overall, very fun atmosphere here.  Unfortunately, I don't live out here but if I did, I'd be at this place every week!

Yes, this is not NY, so nobody really cares as all the blue collar types scarf down the pizza without a care. Two slices cost about 8 bucks with a drink and they are big, so if you eat both, expect a nap, but do not expect a NY pizza experience anymore.    also, avoid the bizarre slice loaded with french fries, chicken and pepperoni.

I have never ordered a full pizza, only a slice. Typically I go with the 1 slice + 6 wing & drink combo for $6.  What detracts from the experience for me is the wait - today I ordered the above mentioned combo at 11:45 and while the wings arrived somewhat quickly, the slice of pepporoni pizza took a long time. I finally had a complete order and started eating at 12:15. The second thing is the size. This place is about the size of a closet - definitely sucks if you are trying to fit a group of people. By group I would say more than 3. There are a few tables in the main room, a couple outside and some in the back room. The problem is there is no traffic flow - the hallway between the rooms is narrow. If the tables are filled, which normally they are, people stand in the room, the hallway and make it challenging to get through. The fountain drink machine is in the back room and makes for a pile up while people try to find a spot, fill a drink and try to back out of the way. As popular as the business is, an expansion is definitely needed!",

Used a coupon code for a discount which I found on their website. Went to pick up and it was ready on time, 25 mins after ordering. Pizza was very tasty (vegetarian specialty pizza) and flavorful. Generous toppings and cheese. Or only minor complaints were that the pie was a little soggy in the center -but this is frequently an issue with vege pizzas since the ingredients are more watery. The cheese bread sticks were supposed to come with marinara sauce I think, but there wasn't any in our package.",

I mean, pizza with really flavorful, crispy crust and quality toppings. With all the hype surrounding Venezia's (and not to mention the flyer I got in the mail) I decided to try it out.  So disappointed.   First, I waited an hour for the pizza. Second, I don't mean to rain on their parade but the Venezia's Supreme I got reminded me of the supreme I'd get from a very common, larger pizza chain... hmm... in other words, super salty and too many flavors clashing on one slice. Third, the crust was a bit bland and mushy like it had been sitting in the box for too long. If I wait an hour for a pizza the crust better be crispy, but sadly that was not the case.   I'm going to give this place a second chance, though...",

You could taste the low quality in the cheese and toppings.  Its really bad, trust me. Do not overspend on a pizza here. If you want quality pizza, go somewhere else. If you want just an average filler type pizza, stick with the chains, they are way better than this place.  People think its good because of the name, and the authentic new york back story.

I spoke to a gentlemen who informed me that they were low on drivers and that a manager had picked up my order 10min's ago to deliver it herself. 15 min after I spoke to him the person delivering the pizza called and explained she was lost. We had ordered from Venenzia's for delivery before with the previous drivers having no problem finding our home. I gave her directions and about 5 min later she showed up. Even with the late delivery I left a standard tip for her and brought the pizza inside. It's 7:10pm by this point and my boys were so excited it finally arrived. We open the pizza box and it was clear the pizza had been sitting out for quite awhile. The pizza was cold and the wings were room temp. The condensation from the packaging had left them soggy and inedible. Frustrated after waiting close to 2hrs for a medium pizza and single order of wings I call to speak to management. I was placed on hold and eventually was disconnected. I decided to drive the order back and ask for a refund. The gentlemen at the counter was apologetic and offered to remake the order ensuring it would take 10-15 min. 20min's later our order was called. The counter lady didn't stay long enough for me to tell her we were missing half our order, the wings. After ignoring us for awhile she came back long enough for me to tell her we did not receive the wings with the pizza order. She asked us to give them 5 more min to get them out...  by 8:15 we finally left with our correct order. The pizza and wings were tasty but absolutely not worth waiting well over 2 1/2 hrs for. I rated them two stars, one for taste and the other for the gentlemen at the counter being the only one in the building caring about rectifying the poor service. Note to self and to anyone reading this... Do not order from Venezia's during peak hours, ever!",

I re-tried Venezia's on my lunch break four days ago, and I have eaten there every day since.  I brought my boyfriend there, and he is obsessed as well.  I am boring and usually just get cheese pizza, but my boyfriend always gets the slice of the day and raves about it, whatever it is.  I also got the Combo B last night, a slice of pizza with a small salad and a drink, and the salad was impressively good.  The Balsamic dressing was excellent, too.  Everyone should try this place out.  The pizza slices are huge, delicious, and satisfying.",

The last time I ordered pizza, the cheese was barely there and the toppings were sliding off.   I usually order Ham + pineapple and 2 dozen HOT wings. I used to order honey hot, but about 6 months ago all of the wing places started setting honey on the side instead of in the sauce (conspiracy?), so I just order hot and pour my own honey on.  The coupon deals on facebook and emails are the exactly the same as on their website. If they had better deals that could compete with the chain prices a bit more, I would order more often.",

Venezia's caught my eye as I had driven by it many times and it had good reviews on yelp. Hopped in the car and headed there. It had a pretty steady crowd which was a good sign. I thought I would order a whole pizza, but then while in online I got into a dilemma. Should I order a whole pie or get slices and try several different types of pizzas. Since I couldn't decide on one pizza I went with 3 slices and even those were hard to decide on since they had so many choices. I had to get a plain cheese slice as you can never go wrong with the classic. I also chose a spicy pepperoni slice and a pesto slice. The slices were great and quite big. I think 2 slices would have been enough, but I chose the third one cause I had to try more. The place was nice and big enough for groups. It also was lined with TVs in case you wanted to watch a sports event so that was cool.",

You provided me with the necessary carbs to go on thinking for another 12 hours. Sometimes, you even gave me fruits and veggies. I appreciate that,   I didn't give 5 stars because sometimes (just sometimes!) your pizza is uber greasy...but I know it's not because of anything gross. It's all the cheese you put on there. I like the cheese, hate the grease. I'm sorry that there's no middle ground on this.  Aside from that, thank you for the tangy sauce that doesn't taste like someone dumped sugar in it. Thank you for the crispy/chewy crust (how do you do that!?) and thank you for being local.

They have a slice of the day in addition to their regulars, but don't let that stop you from getting creative.  They also have the most amazing ranch dressing for dipping.

    "text": "Feeling a bit sluggish one night during vacation, Lisa H and I decided to order from a local pizza joint.  After searching Yelp reviews of places near our hotel, Venezia's seemed to be the place to check out.  Venezia's online menu was nice and comprehensive.  A lot of the pizzas looked really tempting, but we opted for the simple, large one topping pizza (pepperoni), so we could take advantage of the Yelper discount that was available.  We also got an order of the family-size breadsticks.  Venezia gets big points for having an online ordering form!  Nicely done!  But they lose a few points for taking over an hour to deliver to just a few miles away.  Yes, yes, I realize they're probably consistently hoppin', but 60 minutes to get my foodstuffs was a little longer than I'd normally be willing to wait for pizza.  That being said, the pizza and breadsticks did arrive warm, despite the long wait.  Everything was really tasty, definitely some good pizza here!  I was a big fan of the crust.  Just thick enough not to be obnoxious.  And obviously still foldable to be considered NY style, right?  The breadsticks were also quite delicious.  But for two people, the amount that we ordered ended up being way too much!  I guess that's better than not enough.  Overall, if I lived in the area, I'd probably be back to check out more of Venezia's menu.  Good eats at a decent price, for sure.",

    "text": "One night last week, I decided on picking up some pizzas and wings on my way home from work for dinner. I wanted to try some place new. While browsing different menus of various pizza places, I was sold on this one because I saw that they carried golden wings which are my favorite.  On their website they had different specials and I decided on the family special which consisted of 2 large one items and 2 dozen wings for $31.99. Pretty decent deal I thought. I added an extra topping on each pizza and my total was just under $40.   I like my pizza extra crispy so when I got home, I popped the pizzas in the oven for a little while to crisp them up. They were pretty good. I think it definitely made it more enoyable that I crisped them up in the oven for a few minutes. MY favorite type of pizzas are wood fired thin crust ones, but for NY style, these are rated pretty up there.   Wings were decent. They are pretty good sized wings and the sauce was on point. I'd imagine they would be better eaten in house freshly made. The crispiness was no longer there after being closed up in a box and making the drive home. As you can probably tell, I like everything crispy :) But still I liked them. They also had a handful of other flavors to choose from but I'm pretty much sold on golden wings everywhere they carry them.   Venezia would be a top pick if I was craving for NY style pizza. I would order from here again, or actually maybe dine in next time, so everything could be eaten freshly made. Also, huge plus that the restaurant looked cleaned and organized. I actually imagined it to be a little dinkier, but to my surprise it looked like a place that could possibly be suitable for a casual date.",

Even though I graduated from ASU over three years ago, I had no idea this place existed until my husband went there one night with some buddies after a study session. He came home with a large piece of pizza that was so good, and while it was one of the biggest pieces of pizza I had seen at that time, I ate the whole thing.   I have been hooked since. The pizza slices are huge, the slice specials are very nicely priced, and it is never so crowded I hate coming here. I have been to this location and the one in East Mesa, and I have to say that this one is way better. The pizza just tastes better, even though its the exact same pizza. We usually only get slices. We tried a whole pizza one time, but for some reason it just didn't taste the same as the slices. I don't know what that's about but in my opinion the slices are a better value anyways. My husband and I can eat dinner of two slices each, and each with a drink for under $15. And that's a win in my book. I usually end up taking one of the slices home for lunch the next day as well. So I get more than one meal out of it.   If you want to eat some good, cheap pizza, definitely hit this place up. The pizza comes out hot, fast, and delicious. You wont be sorry you tried it.",

The dough was too thick, and it ended up tasting like a regular style pizza you can get anywhere.  Sure, I'm not expecting 100% authenticity here since we are on the opposite end of the U.S., but I didn't really see any semblance of NY in this pizza.  In addition, our mushroom pizza hardly had any mushrooms in it, and the ones that were in there were shriveled, small, and hidden inside the pizza- I probably wouldn't have noticed any difference in taste in this mushroom pizza from a regular cheese pizza.  We ordered a dozen honey hot wings as well, which I liked substantially better.  They were a nice combination of spicy, salty, and sweet.",

The pizza is always fresh and hasn't been sitting out all day like at Slices. The wings and salads are average, but will get the job done when needed. The sandwiches are legit, but stick to the pizza, you won't be disappointed. It used to be an awkward table set up but they just re-did the seating. Bottom line it's the best NY style slice around!",

    "text": "The pizza here is pretty tasty, and the slices are HUGE- my stepdaughter got three meals out of a single slice.  I think they put entirely too much cheese on their pizza.  I like to be able to taste the sauce, and not have to search for it under an inch of gooey cheese.  I recognize that I'm probably in the minority in that sense.  The sandwich I had was so-so.  It's called the \"Italian w/ peppers\" or something along those lines, but there were no peppers on mine.  I like that they serve Boar's Head meats, because as far as lunchmeat goes theirs has the least amount of junk in it.   Their fries were awful.  They tasted like reheated fast food fries.  I paid an extra $1.25 to \"upgrade\" but I won't do it again.   All in all though, I'm glad this place is in my neighborhood.  It's clean, cheap, quick and the pizza is FAR better than any of the chain places in the area.",

Come on Roma, get on that, we need to know that Italian!  But seriously, Ive been to pizza places all over the country and this is my favorite type - big New York style slices, pipping hot, not too greasy and loaded with a delicious not too sweet sauce. Venezia's is my favorite pizza place in this style in Arizona. Ive been to Pizzeria Bianco and having had to wait the 2 or 3 hours to be seated til I was so hammered from being at Bar Bianco next door I couldnt remember what I ate or how it tasted from being so hungry, I can easily say, Venezia's is where you should go if you want a great filling slice of pizza in the Valley. They also catered an event I promoted with several of their party pizzas and they were delicious. They always have courteous quick servers and I even enjoy their fountain drinks. Not to mention, they always have great specials if you follow them on Twitter. On Tuesdays, you can get a huge slice of pizza and a large drink for under 2 dollars. I cant say enough good things about this place, check them out, theyre amazing.",

    "text": "Truly the most inefficient restaurant that I eat at, or have eaten at, Venezias is a place with good food but little idea how to properly serve it.   As a native northeasterner I've been to many pizzerias but I've never been to a place that takes your order and takes your name when all you want is a slice of pizza and it's situated two feet to the left of the register.   Please, just take my money and then scoop me a slice onto a plate and hand it to me or scoop it into the oven and then wait on the next person.  Venezias makes things far more complicated than it has to and I've had my order screwed up numerous times there.   The restaurant has something called a Party Pizza. It's the restaurant's largest size pie. It's the slices from that size pie that go on sale as individual slices. If you order a pizza pie to go that isn't a party pizza (say a large or XL) you get a different size pizza that I believe actually tastes different.   The slices are actually excellent. It truly is NY style Neopolitan pizza and the chicken wings are good too. Service is nothing what you'd expect in a pizzeria though.  It's NY style pizza but not NY style service. Everything is done slowly and overly methodically. The Tempe location is a crowded, narrow, suck-in- your-gut to pass by someone kind of place. That's not unlike other pizzerias, but in other places you only have to wait around for your order if you have something that needs to be cooked.   Venezias makes you wait in some kind of pecking order to get your slice when a server behind the counter reads your name off of the register receipt. That's just bizarre. For a small cramped place that gets crowded during lunch they waste so much time asking every customer their name and then typing it into the register so it prints on the receipt.   Also, this is a pizzeria, not a fine italian restaurant. There is not a need for luxo-looking pleather booths and chairs to go along with fancy new tables. The old rickety ones were just fine.   This is a grab a meal and go place, not a break out the candles and wine kinda joint. The metal tables and chairs you have outside are just fine. The new accommodations take up valuable space in an otherwise cramped dining area.  Good pizza, good wings, strange service and prices that have risen steadily over the past few years. It it were more efficient I'd give it another star, I'd even go there to eat more often than I do.  Addendum: As of the Fall 09 this place has expanded and is actually too big. It's quite comfortable though and patrons seem to spend a longer amount of time there than before. There are a few flat screens on the wall too. Their method is still strange  and they call slice orders out over a microphone. Sit in the back dining room and you might not hear your name. Service even got a bit friendlier. I added an additional star (going from 3 to 4) for the renovations and friendlier service.",

Great value if you want a lunch close to $5.  Even a college student will find this place affordable.  Their wings are also delicious, and I have lately found myself gravitating towards a slice and wings instead of two slices.  Also, if you found this place cramped before, you should know that they recently remodeled.

They also have this challenge, if you and one other person eat a party size pizza in an hour, you and friend get a picture on their wall and two free t-shirts.

Located in a plaza, ironically placed next to a massive LA Fitness Venezia's looks like a typical pizza shop but don't let that fool you. Upon entering, you are able to see an open kitchen with diligently workers are tending their task in pizza making. They serve pasta, salad, wings, protein bowls and of course pizza! I ended up sharing a small supreme pizza and wings with my friend. Service is fast and you get your food brought to your table.  We got Honey BBQ wings were great! I appreciated the crisp exterior, but juicy interior. The sauce was good and was served along side crudites that of course were dunked in ranch dressing. Their ranch dressing is also out of this world good. The pizza is thin, well deserving of the New York title, gooey and stretchy cheese that can only be seen in cartoons and yummy toppings. Toppings included mushrooms, sausage, pepperoni, green peppers, onions and black olives. I also have to mention how much I enjoyed the crust, because TBH I'm a crust hater and leave them on my plate stacked like Lincoln logs. However, the crust here was chewy and soft. The one gripe I have here, was the fact that if you didn't pick up your pizza correctly, or folded it all of the toppings - cheese and all would slide off! The flavor and everything else made up for that though. Also, I had the pizza for left overs and it was just as good and the cheese was still amazingly stretchy!  Fast service, delicious pizza fresh or as left overs, price point a little more expensive than your usual pizza shops but portion and quality trumps.  Check-in on Yelp for a discount!",

A real NY joint would serve their wings with blue cheese dressing and NOT ranch.  LOL  The pizza in my opinion falls short of a good NYC pie like you find at Grimaldi's.    However,  based on the numerous great reviews I would suggest trying this place to form your own opinion.  I will likely return but I will try a hero or sub.  (Sub, like hoagie is a NJ term.  Most NYers might say Grinder or Wedge)",

    "text": "All in all, I personally won't be ordering delivery from here again.   BUT, if you're a pizza fan, and certainly if you're a fan of the big slice pizza places I used to see at the malls, I'm guessing you'd really like this place. I'd just be sure to order and eat there! Here's why....  This was the first time I've ordered from here. And for full disclosure, I'm not a big pizza fan like I was in high school. Mostly because my tastes have somewhat changed and l haven't  found many that taste spectacular.   But, the pictures people posted looked really good, and my house munchkin saw the chicken and fries and wanted that... so I ordered!  When the food arrived, it looked great! It was on time and my GrubHub guy even kept the Cannoli separate from the warm foods. I just wish it had tasted as great as it looks.  And to be clear, I don't ever expect delivery to be as good as eating it AT the restaurant. But, I also don't mind having to reheat or crisp up my delivery food as needed.  Having said that, here's the breakdown...  Munchkin's chicken and fries... The fries were super soggy, even for delivery! I tossed them in the toaster oven to see if I could crisp them up. Ten minutes later, they were more crisp.... but they were a weird chewy texture. So we decided to skip the fries.  I didn't have to reheat the chicken because then I'd just have to let it cool down for the 4-year-old! She liked that part, so she ate the just the chicken. I figured what the heck, a lot of restaurants don't do kids meals very well (even though they should!)   The garlic bread... not bad, but nothing super special. I reheated it a bit in the toaster oven too. It coulda used some more garlic and seasoning, but we liked it well enough to eat most if it.  The pizza... I ordered one of their large slices with pepperoni, black olives and extra cheese. Im glad I ordered extra though, because it was the amount I get normally at the pizza place I usually call.   The good part is, since I don't eat as much as I used to, there was enough there to fill me up, share with the munchkin, AND still have leftovers (in 4-year-old portion size) for breakfast. I had put it in the oven for a few minutes to reheat and remelt the cheese as well.   This was by far the best part of what we ordered. And that makes sense... order piza from a pizza place right? But even that wasn't something I'd order again... unless I was in a hurry, was hungry for pizza, and could eat it fresh at the restaurant.   And my thought is, regardless of your specialty, if you're not gonna cook the rest of it as well, then don't have it on the menu!!   And finally, the Cannoli... not my kind of dessert maybe? The crust was a hard crunchy pastry and I hed expected something a little flakier and the filling, while not a bad flavor, had a gritty texture vs a smooth pudding or custard type thing. Again, it could just be me as this is the first time I've ever had it!",

Down side- super tiny pizza for way too much money. For reference my almost 3 year old, tiny, picky eater ate half the pizza and shared the rest with his 1yr old sister. Yeah. There are a couple other places with superior GF pizza actually worth the price and bigger but they don't deliver, so this will do in a pinch if you don't mind paying an arm and a leg.  I ordered a gluten-free cheese pizza and a protein bowl- both came out to $30- insane right. A lot of tacked on fees but whatever I was desperate. FYI- I tried using the coupons from an ad and from yelp but neither worked so your better off calling it in rather than using the app if you want the ad discount.",

It's about time a real New Yorker like me stood up and informed everyone in the valley that this is NOT what pizza is like in New York. I think any pizza that isn't Chicago deep dish is called \"New York Style\" in the valley and I will deal with Gus' Pizza Falsely claiming to be NY Style in a separate review. Venezia's pizza does have a very pleasant sauce and good tasting ingredients, but let's face it...it is RUBBERY like Domino's Pizza, even if the ingredients are a notch up. A New Yorker never eats pizza at a chain restaurant and would NEVER put up with the size and price scheme that Venezia is running. Let it be known that what Venezia calls an XL (EXTRA LARGE) pie is slightly smaller in diameter than the normal standard size pizza in NYC.  Their so-called \"Large\" pie is an insult to consumers. That is what NYC pizzeria's call either a \"small pie,\" \"bar pie,\" or \"personal pie.\" I once asked for a little extra cup of sauce on the side and they wanted to charge me for it. That's the kind of utilitarian drain-every-nickel corporate chain attitude that you would NEVER see in a NYC pizzeria. Venezia's is NOT authentic Italian.  With everything I've just said, Venezia's is still probably the best pizza in the valley...THE TALLEST MIDGET IN THE ROOM in the valley of fake inauthentic overpriced ethnic food! (and by the way, it's been about 5 years since one esoteric episode of the TV show Breaking Bad used a Venezia's pizza box as a prop. With every year that passes, fewer people will remember it or care. Enough already! )",

I ordered delivery from here yesterday because had work done on the house so was stuck at home, and have been wanting to try it. I ordered a XL pepperoni pizza, antipasto salad and boneless wings. The wing flavor was ok, but the wings were really, really soggy - expected with delivery to a certain degree but not that much.  HIGHLY recommend ordering regular wings if you are getting take-out/delivery. The pizza was disappointing, I thought it had NOOO flavor and was light on the cheese. I am not rushing to eat the leftovers and that's not like me. The antipasto salad was decent, but I've had better. I definitely don't get the hype for this place. I would head to Rosati's (their antipasto salad is awesome) or Buono's if I was craving the same style pizza. I won't choose to order from here again.",

Now, I am super picky about my pizza, as I have formerly worked at 5 pizza places and I am just sick of pizza in general, so pizza has to be stellar for me to eat it at all. Also, I LOVE wings and love hot/spicy food. And I love vegetables! So, I skeptically opened the pizza to see, and it looked pretty good actually. Wow. It really was amazing! Lots of toppings, and extra cheesy! Then I tried the hot wings and they were really yummy, too. I felt some heat, so I decided to try the salad to cool things down, and I gotta say the salad was a perfect salad: super fresh and crisp ingredients, the perfect amount of toppings. I was very impressed! Obviously this restaurant uses high quality ingredients and cares about the quality of the food.  Anyhow, even after I ate the salad, I wanted another wing...mind you only the second one.  After eating it, wow!!!...my mouth was on FIRE!! Now I like hot food, but holy moly these wings were HOT!  I drank milk, ate bread, and held and ice pack to my lips for 15 min before my mouth started to cool down! LITERALLY. So, what I am trying to say is, please understand that  \"hot wings\" means \"hot-as-hell\" wings...just sayin...I'm just trying to protect you.  I will definitely order from this place again.",

Whenever I have friends over and they want to order pizza I always suggest this place and they're easily impressed. Their online order form is easy to use and they offer plenty of coupons. I had a bad experience one time and their customer service was phenomenal and did everything they could to remedy the issue. I've considered other pizza places but given this level of customer service and quality of pizza, I'm happy to stick with Venezia's pizza.",

It's so good I just order plain cheese most of the time because it doesn't even need extras, in my opinion, which says a lot. I'm usually a \"supreme\" kind of gal. After suggesting to my boss at work to give them a try, now any time they order pizza for us, it's got to be Venezia's huge party pizzas! The sauce is not too sweet, not too acidic, and the cheese has a really good flavor that goes with the yummy crust. The crust is tasty too! For desert I love their cheesecake with added strawberries. The salads are fresh and interesting. I'm not much of a sald eater but their salads aren't boring.Try their fried zucchini with honey mustard! The one thing I'm not a fan of is their spaghetti... but they are my default pizza place for sure!",

I am a little perplexed at some of the other reviews on here complaining about \"greasy\" pizza. Do you know what causes grease?  High quality meat toppings for starters and whole milk mozz! If you want skim milk mozz with modified food starch added, go to Papa Johns. The bigger point here is, their pizza is not even that greasy! Do yourself a favor, hop aboard the Venezia's fanclub train and experience on of the better pies in the valley! Bonus, they manage to have great customer service even when the line is out the door!",

I tried my friends garden salad with balsamic dressing, which was also good. Apparently they have a pizza challenge were you eat one of their largest pie within a time limit. Pretty cool to pass the time looking at all the losers...and few winners. Anyway, it appeared pretty modern in decor and was clean. The service was friendly and prompt.

For the past three weekends (we come every weekend), something has been left off our order - always one of the pizzas. Last week the excuse was that it was \"left off the ticket\" - umm no, that's not how tickets work - it gets printed with the invoice and that's that. Tonight topped it - they forgot our pizza yet again so we went and asked where it was. They said they were sorry and it was coming out soon. 15 minutes later - pizza comes out with different toppings than what we asked for. On another note - all of the food is inconsistent. From week to week, the food tastes different (from salads to appetizers to pizzas) - sometimes the pizza is dripping in oil, sometimes dry as a bone. Is there any staff training for consistency? Again - it's odd because this problem is only at the Tempe location. Never had this problem at Gilbert or Scottsdale.",

After the driver left we opened the boxes to check the goods and start serving when we noticed the pizzas were smashed up and folded over onto each other, and the pieces were all separated. This is how each box looked; as if the driver hit a few bumps in the road and smashed the brakes a few times on the way over. The kids were getting hungry and it was time to serve lunch.   Immediately I rang up the Mill and Southern store  where I had placed the order and spoke to the manager. He offered to remake the pies and send them over in about 20 minutes but I said I would prefer a refund, and that is exactly what he did for me. That was a relief.   Quick-acting customer service like that will have me ordering from Venezia's more often. It's been a couple days since the party and I'm still working on polishing off the leftover pizza!",

Instead, it was some metal thing/piece that was in the chicken. The photos of it is shown below.  I'm fortunate that I didn't swallow it. I'm definitely not going there anymore.

If you go to NYC they all have coke. They even run ads on tv about it. Solution is take it Togo. They do a great job on take out they even have a separate like for takeout. Then you can drink a coke with it. But I guess cause it's really Arizona style pizza it's supposed to go with a Pepsi.",

We try to get there a bit early (before noon) to beat the rush. It can get crowded but the cashiers are fast and polite. They have a variety of ice teas which is perfect for me.    I have had the pepperoni pizza a couple of times and it was good too. My favorite thing about Venezia's Pizzeria is the HUGE pizzas they make. I have had one to eat in, but sometimes we order them for work events. I love eating it cold.  There is something about cheese that was once melted and is now cold again. Call me weird, but their pizza rocks cold!  Yesterday for the first time I noticed the dessert case. Wow, chocolate cannoli?  As I've just lost weight, I skipped dessert but boy oh boy, did they look amazing.  (I really wanted one!)

Talk to the managers if you had a bad experience!   Did I forget to mention the PIZZA IS AHMAZING FOR FAST SLICES!",

They always have different specialty pizzas every day but that keeps it interesting.  The wings are good too. They come in 5 or 10 and have a variety of flavors.  Overall an amazing experience and highly recommend",

You can order by the slice or you can order a pizza from size small to a whopping 24 inches wide!!!  This place is always busy but you get your food in a timely manner.  They also have salads, hot wings, starters & slides, hot & cold sandwiches, low carb pizza bowls,calzones and pasta dishes to choose from!  The slices are HUGE and yummy!!!  Lots of choices!!!  :). What more could you ask for ......perhaps a Bib for your drool!!!",

Instead of the 30-45 minute delivery that turns into 90 minutes, they quote 1 hour and usually show up in 45 minutes or less. Consistent quality that might not be the very best available but without a doubt way above the norm for delivery.",

My family comes here every Friday but after tonight, I don't think we will be going back for some time. The pizza has been very dry and flavorless. I don't know how you can make pizza flavorless, but that's how all of our pizzas were tonight. New management maybe ?",

Unfortunately the customer service has greatly declined. Anna and adorable young lady with dark hair, a pixie cut, really cool black glasses, and a horrible attitude. She couldn't crack a smile even after I offered her a compliment. No worries, everybody has his/her bad days, right? Well she also managed to mess up our order not once, but twice and never apologized... Or smiled. The food is AMAZING! I didn't think the pizza could get any better, but it gets better every time. It might be good to explain to the staff that making customers feel welcome is what they are paid to do. Customer service isn't for everyone... Maybe Anna is destined to launch an awesome \"start up\", but being nice to business patrons is not her niche.",

She took my NAME since I was eating there-not a pick-up.   I saw people after me come and go, so went up to counter after 20 minutes & inquired. \"It's coming...we'll call your name\", she said.  Waited another 15 minutes, then went up again. Now my lunch time is over, and I don't even have my pizza.  \"Hmmm...let me check\"... she walked off.  It had been done 14 people ago (I looked at the number the box had on it, and the last number called. Since it was PUT IN A BOX, they figured it was take-out, and waited for someone to show up and ASK for it!  Now, after all that, the pizza was very...ordinary. Sauce (what little there was) was bland-like just tomato paste or something. Ingredients (which I ordered extra of-and PAID extra) were so sparse I though they'd left off the mushrooms...until I saw one on a slice. Yes. ONE.  People, if you think this is good pizza, go to Spinato's. Tempe or Ahwatukee. You will be AMAZED at what  a really tasty pie tastes like.   I will NEVER go to this  brand again.  Overall BAD.  (I didn't even bother with a picture, and threw 3/4 of it in trash)",

The only reason I can't give it 5 stars is while the pizza was good it was not mind blowing. The sauce for the pizza was the highlight in my opinion. It's an honest slice but at least the day I ordered I felt like the dough was a bit flat and didn't have enough structure to it (even for the style).   In a smaller town this would have been 5 star pizza but there is some very stiff competition for best pizza in Phoenix Metro area and this just falls a little short of being top notch.",

So one day it was raining and cold. I was out running errands and did not want to mess up the house cooking when I got home.  So I had a coupon so I came here to Venezia's! First I called on the phone to order a large Pizza and some wings.I have been craving Wings,soooo. Anyway, I got there a little early. Parking for pick up right in front,very nice. As I sat inside looking around it was clean and well maintained. Counter for napkins, condiments and such, clean and well stocked.  They were busy pick up orders, people coming in to get a slice, etc. They handle it very well. Everyone is calm and it runs very smoothly.  One girl that was cutting Pizza and boxing every thing up made it all look so easy. She was wearing a hat and had tattoos,I say that because, I do not know her name. But, she was getting those orders out so quickly and efficiently/ I was amazed how she made it all look so easy. Bravo to her, she rocks. The smell inside was really good. Italian Food on a cold day smells fantastico!  When We sat down to eat at home. It was fantastic! I love their Pizza. Their wings were meaty and spicy! This is it , I have found my new Pizza Heaven! I am so excited.  Also I read the menu and took a to go menu home, I can't wait to try all the other items, I am sure they are just as wonderful!",

However, the woman who helped me was very friendly and provided excellent service. And the wait time was reasonable for how busy it was.   As for the food, the pizza was amazing- I ordered the Italian Stallion. My first bite was in the car, and I had to rush home to finish eating it! Definitely the best pizza I've had since I've lived in Phoenix. I plan on recommending the pizza to have catered at work.   The wings on the other hand, nothing I would order again. They were soggy and not anything impressive. Maybe it's my fault for ordering boneless?   If you want some awesome pizza though, definitely eat here!",

Take it home and dress it up more with your own toppings , what the heck!  Before I acquired my allergy to wheat I would order the usual pepperoni pie. Really wonderful hot. Key word is HOT.",

And also, I pre-ordered a couple of pizzas for my husbands birthday, and requested the pizza come to our office at 11:30. Mind you we are less than 5 minutes away from venezias and the pizzas arrived cold!! What happened? I was very disappointed and embarrassed, as I was telling all my office buddies how fresh and yummy these pizzas are. All the money I spent and the effort I made to pre order, and I get old tasting pizza. will not order delivery again.",

    "text": "A manager reached out to me after I left my review previously. Was apologetic and even gave me a large credit. It had won my business back. Until tonight. I ordered again as I had several times since my last review. Unfortunately after not seeing my order for over an hour and a half I called the store. Was put on hold a few times. The manager I spoke with called the driver and said he was close. I received a 10 dollar credit for my inconvenience. But sadly the order issues didn't end there. I finally had my food delivered. Oddly the receipt I was to sign was on a blank slip. As in just a strip of white receipt paper with nothing printed on it. For the record I tipped as I know the economy is tough. As the driver handed me my food he informed me an item was left behind. My salad. He said he was running back to get it. And he did. I finally had my order completed over two hours later. Order went out at 8:03pm. I finally got all I paid for at 10:08pm. But worst of all. The salad was warm enough it wasn't edible. I decided to toss it. As it was room temp. Even the parmesan cheese packets I asked for were missing.  I am sorry to say that even though I love your food. From your pizza to pasta to sandwiches and wings. I can't order from here anymore. I realize and understand in the food industry days can go wrong. Under staffing or sick call outs. From equipment issues. I realize that working with the public can be difficult. I myself work in management retail. A phone call to me explaining it was running late and why could have made a difference. But for me as a customer having this many mistakes where it's just about 25 to 30 percent failure rate. I won't be spending my money here. I hope others get s better experience.",

This place however is probably the best bang for your buck in terms of quality pizza in the Tempe area. My boyfriend is from New Jersey and this is the best we've found so far in Tempe.  I've only ordered pickup, but the staff working there is always very friendly and kind. I've never had them make a mistake on my orders either.  I LOVE their wings! Very good if you are a wing lover and I'd recommend them even if you aren't the biggest wing lover.",

    "text": "Based on the reviews here and having lived in NJ I really thought this place would be a True NY style pizza...As soon as I saw the oven I knew this would not be the case.  They use a Middleby Marshall oven (same type used by Dominos where the pies are cooked on a conveyor).  The real pizza joints in NJ / NY will generally use a Bakers Pride where they drop the pizza, close the oven door in and turn it occasionally with a pizza peal.  At the risk of sounding like a pizza nerd, I think the crispiness and flavor of a pizza cooked in the Bakers Pride is superior with the Middleby giving a rubbery texture.  The pizza here was somewhat akin to a Dominos pizza.  Now they did give me a lot of cheese and were generous with the toppings but for me the crust is crucial...and this crust was just ok.  Sorry Phoenix but Venezia is nothing like you get in NY",

Maybe when you get the slices that have been sitting out for a little while and then get reheated, it takes off some of that grease and cooked the cheese a little more. I love the slices!",
