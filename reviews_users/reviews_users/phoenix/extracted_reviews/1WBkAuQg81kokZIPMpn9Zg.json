This time was horrible. There were 3 tables in the restaurant and it took over 30 minutes to get food to our table. Both the sliders and charr burger, ordered medium, we well done and too dry to eat. They offered to make new burgers, but since it took 30 minutes to get our food, there was not enough time to wait for them to make new food.  The table next to us also had overcooked burgers and were also upset.  Too bad, we live close, but would rather make the drive to Delux.",

In our case, every aspect was just spot on. My eldest, the self styled expert on wings, pronounced Charr's Chili Glazed Wings the best she's ever had. My youngest, not a wing fan, devoured them. High praise from both ends of the spectrum.  Last night, spot on again. Burgers on large garlic knots are excellent, juicy and perfectly cooked. Wings...yep, perfect again. A couple of Leini'e Summer Shandy bottles, super cold and served in cold glasses by our excellent and friendly server Kevin (only his third day, and you'd never know. Great job Kevin!) Fries were nice and crispy (called Truffle Fries, and while did not taste the truffle oil, they were still very good).   Really well done concept, great service and excellent food!",

    "text": "I was so looking forward to the opening of Charr.  Menu was looking great, right down the street from us,, burgers beers and fries.  How could it go wrong?    Sadly, it just all went wrong.  My wife and I just grabbed a spot at the bar early on a Friday afternoon.  Not too busy at all, early dinner and drinks.  Keep in mind, we are sitting right \"In the Middle of the Bar\".  Took us what seemed like 5+ mins to get our first drink.  Were then waiting another 5+ mins before we were asked if we would like to order food.  Ok, definitely could have flagged a bartender down for attention if I wanted, but for a first visit was just seeing how the service truly was.  So already, we are off to a bad start.  Our order was to split the Sliders on Mini Garlic Knots, the 5-cheese Melt and order of fries.  1) Sliders were dry and very overcooked.  Was missing the Chipotle mayo and the buns seemed not fresh and too dense with absolutely no Garlic flavor.  Sorry, if you are a burger joint and you put sliders on the menu, they better be damn good.  2) Five Cheese Melt was......incredibly flavorless.  We didn't even finish.  I was shocked.  5 cheeses an grilled sourdough!!!  How is it possible that it could be flavoress?  5 CHEESES!   3) French Fries are the only reason it's not a 1 Star review.  They are really good.  Not the best ever or ground breaking, but still very crisp and delicious.  Their is no way in hell they are worth $6, but they are still good.  My wife and I promised we would give them one more shot and this time be more vocal if needed.  We really want Charr to work out but if the food and service remains the same, our next visit will sadly be our last.",

We waited 10 minutes to be seated although there were only two other tables occupied and the waitress and cook walked past us 5 times.  Then we sat at a filthy table, were served ice tea that had gone rancid (seriously it must have been says old!). When we asked for something thing else the waitress said she might have to charge us for it.  We had both taken a sip of the tea and asked for a fountain soda?  She relented but with a ton of attitude.  We ordered our food, it took 40 minutes to get to us, it was not well made or cooked to order as both burgers were burnt.  To top it off the restaurant is just dirty.  The owner came out covered in filth to tell off color jokes to the table of regulars next to us.  Never again!  Just awful.",

Definitely could have done better.  I just don't understand why these places try and get fancy and butcher an American classic.  I don't need a fancy bun, especially if it's burnt, and if you aren't going to season the meat, at least make up for it in other areas.  The fries and southwest sauce was pretty good though.  On another note, there was a cold seafood bar near the kitchen, so I'm not even sure what theme they are going for here.  I can get surf and turf somewhere else, not at a burger joint.  If I lived close, I would give it another try, but don't expect it to blow you away.  Just another trendy burger joint in my honest opinion.",

Just an FYI, the fries come with your burger and other sides come with the meal, so kudos to them for listening to the previous gripes and addressing them.   I have been twice. I will be back again. It is a nice date spot, great dim atmosphere with some music, but you are able to carry on a conversation with ease.  And, like I noted before: lack of children.  The few I have seen were all well behaved and parentally managed.  The service was great both times, friendly, knowledgeable and attentive without hovering.

    "text": "Although happy to find another decent place to eat in the Lovely's hood, this was not a 5 star experience.   The good: revamped Market Bistro space is attractive and the bar selection solid. The burgers were very good and the garlic knots they're served on, equally delicious. The portions were fair - that is not overly generous or skimpy - and the food was fresh. Service was prompt and hostesses polite. Owner came through twice to ask about our experience. Prices are okay.   The not so good: We were put at a table that did not have proper clearance between us and the next table on one side and a booth on the other. It meant that a large woman's stomach met my back as she passed through. Mmmm blech. Wait staff frequently hit the chair. I moved to the other side which meant that no one could get through there but it moved traffic around the two tables. Music, although nice, was too loud.   For the number of families we saw in there, this does not read as kid friendly. I have a 10 year old for whom we ordered sliders without the peppers and chipotle mayo and although we could've sprung for a milk shake [hello more sugar] water was about my only other option and bonus! free. Now, I'm not expecting the crayon greeting that we get at CPK, but it just didn't have the family vibe to me. Kiddo liked the burger and the brownie dessert [which came as described on the menu but without the whipped cream] and the lovely seconded the dessert thumbs up.   My flat iron salad had freshly cut romaine, homemade croutons, some bermuda onion, corn and black beans and a slice of tomato that was cut in half. I asked for the dressing on the side. It came with a good portion of sliced flatiron steak that although cooked well, had zero seasoning and the dressing on the side was described as a southwest caesar. I didn't get southwest and I did get blah/lacking in flavor.   Bottom line, we'd go back but for the burgers only. Cost of the meal for three of us with no drinks, only water, was $40. Its nice that its in the hood and that there is good food but overall it was good, not great.",

    "text": "We were thrilled to see that Joe was opening Charr in Moon Valley along with Mini-Aiello's and his awesome pizza place. We were not disappointed.  From the hostess to the bartender to our waitress to Joe himself coming to chat with us, you feel like you are a regular at a restaurant that you've been going to for years. We were seated and ordered drinks, some alcoholic and some not, and all were good. The dirty Grey Goose martini was especially good. It's nice to find a place that will make it dirty when asked, instead of skimping on the olive juice. Always a plus for us is a strong, free wi-fi connection. Just ask your server for the password.  For our appetizers, our table had the tomato bisque soup, onion rings, and the red fresno pepper poppers. The soup was very creamy and thick, and the goat cheese was a great added flavor. The poppers brought some extreme heat to the table. These aren't your wimpy Sonic jalapeno poppers. The onion cream cheese filling cut the heat a bit with a nice tang, but be warned, these things pack a punch! As to the onion rings, I won't call them a \"miss\", but they were just so-so after the other two great offerings.  Various burgers were ordered along with some sandwiches. Everyone loved the obviously fresh-made garlic knot buns and fresh toppings. The sauteed crimini mushrooms and carmelized onions on my steak and blue sandwich were awesome. If you are a fan of the blue cheese, ask for extra. It was a little skimpy on my sandwich for my taste.  We were offered the desserts (made by Joe) including bread pudding and an apple crumble, but we were all too full to try those. Definitely next time.",

When our entree eventually came, it was cooked incorrectly and was incomplete, missing sides of French fries for each burger.    The owner came by our table several times making crass jokes and being offensive. The waitress unapologetically blamed the slow service on \"trivia night\" and only being staffed with two waitresses.  To top it off when we go to address our experience with management, the rude owner comes over and tells us to GET OUT, mocks our concerns, and asks us to never come back. NEVER have I felt more uncomfortable and offended than during my visit to Charr.   The sad thing is, the food here was decently good.",

While the buns were delicious, the burger was slapped together like an afterthought. I had a dollop of BBQ sauce under my top bun and a puddle beneath it. The ice cream in our apple cobbler was clearly freezer burned.  To top it all off, the head chef was wandering around the restaurant, greeting guests and getting kind of touchy feely with people. He also had a conversation with a server about an unhappy customer within earshot of our table.  Look, I get that $33 for two people is on caliber with Chili's, but at least I remember Chili's consistently delivering HOT food -- even if said hot food tastes like hot garbage. If the goal of Restaurant Week is to get people to come back and try more expensive menu items, Charr failed on basically every level.",

I love crab meat, anyway, but this sandwich(to me, anyway), was out of this world.  Can't remember the name of our server, but he really took care of us.  I guess I shouldn't expect anything less than this, from an Aiello's establishment.  I'm glad, I live close to this place.  And, they have a patio, with a high pressure mist system, that really cools the place, off.  Thank you, Joe.",

Whenever I have friends or family in town we always go to Charr. Occasionally we'll see the roadrunner make an appearance on the patio. Joe, the owner, runs a phenomenal three restaurants! It's obvious the staff are happy, appreciated and love what they do. The truffle fries are to die for and when you're craving a dessert and adult beverage you can kill two birds with one stone. I have recommended Charr to many people over the years and will continue to!",

The food wasn't that bad, but the service and drinks were horrible.  The restaurant was only about 20% full, and it seemed fully staffed -- there was no excuse for the poor service.  Drink order took about 10 minutes, and despite the 2 hours we were there, no one ever asked if we wanted another drink.  It took 37 minutes to get our appetizer.  I guess if the food was outstanding, we might give it another try, but my husband's medium burger was well well done, and the rest of our food was underwhelming.",

    "text": "I would have giving another star if the burgers were cooked correctly. I think if mostly all you do is burgers they should be cooked the way you asked for and we were the only table they were cooking for at the time. We ordered two burgers and asked for one medium rare and the other medium. The medium rare one came out rare. The medium one came out medium well. So both of us were slightly disappointed but being one off we could manage and didn't want to waste time having one thrown back on.   The burger I had seemed to be seasoned nice with a slight charr. About half the people are like me and will only eat half the roll because that's too much bread to eat. I thought the house made garlic knot was good and not too garlicky with the burger. (but I only ate the smaller half not the whole roll) But my companion eat the whole thing and said all together it was too much garlic so it can go either way.  The truffle string fries are OK but don't didn't taste truffles on our visit. Maybe they left it off or maybe they use real truffle oil that's very delicate? Usually if you taste a lot of truffle flavor it's artificial truffle aroma. So that may be a good thing that we didn't taste the truffle.  We both had margaritas and I'd pass on them them next time as they were large and too much mixer in proportion to booze.  Two burgers that came with the fries and two margaritas about $40.00 before tip.",

No one greeted us for at least 10 minutes.  When the very tan, blond woman finally approached us, she was very kurt and I never did see a smile one her face.  We ordered drinks, which were delivered in a timely manner but when we were ready to order we found her to become very rude when I asked about customizing my meal.  When I finally conceded to her inflexibility she rudely snatched the menu out of my hand, with a nasty look on her face and stomped off in the direction of the computer to place our order.  At that point I decided we were through.  I expressed my feelings in what was probably an inappropriate way, left a few bucks to cover the cost of our drinks and headed for the door.  As we did, the server said, \"don't f**king f**k me!\"  There are only 3 reasons to go out to eat in my opinion.  Good food, good ambience, good service.  Food has been good when I have eaten and the ambience is good but the poor service combined with ugly attitude makes this place a disaster...    Yeah, won't be going back here ever again....",

Service has been great every time we've been there, prompt and attentive but not intrusive.  The burgers are always lovely, juicy and done as requested --a perfect pink medium rare--and the fries are addictive.  Monday night is bargain burger night and a complete steal.  Love this place!  A great addition to the Moon Valley neighborhood. The owner has been in the house every time we've been here and he always checks in to make sure we're enjoying our meal.

Though they are on the pricey side on their regular menu, the restaurant week deal was generous. A large and very strong cocktail, the Charrismo (their take on a cosmopolitan). Quite good. Appetizers, I had crab cakes, GF had wings after asking to make sure they weren't too spicy. They were about a 5 on a scale of 10 spiciness, too much for her. Waitress offered to exchange 'em, but we simply swapped. I thought they were great. Fries with orders, I had salmon burger (great), GF had Portobello Burger (phenomenal). I had a beer flight, she had a glass of Chardonnay. Then we still had desserts, but were full so we'll get to those tonight. Really a great deal for 30 bucks per. I'll be back, probably for Happy Hour because they are a bit pricey on the regular menu.....",

They  have a few decent craft beers on tap as well so that's a bonus. The only thing I didn't quite like is the buns, which seem to fall apart creating a mess. The truffle fries are delicious.",

    "text": "Charr hosted our company holiday party last night and it was fantastic! Myrah and Joe were great to work with and everything exceeded my expectations. They have a buyout package, so we had the restaurant to ourselves for the evening, and Myrah was great working with our DJ and photo booth and ensuring everything would work for the night of. I arrived before the event started and it being my first visit to charr, I was very impressed with the atmosphere and the staff was working hard to make sure everything looked great. They provided a buffet dinner and the bar was available to employees. Once it got dark, they lit the fire pits on the patio and it had a nice, warm feeling to it. I would definitely recommend them for a private party for a large group (we had about 60 attendees). The only reason I'm not giving them 5 stars is because the food was from Aiello's (their sister restaurant), so I can't speak to the food at charr's. But I will definitely return and recommend them based on the service they provided last night and throughout the planning process.",

    "text": "We live across Thunderbird, in a residential neighborhood behind the condos. We moved in in December, and were optimistic that there were pizza/burger joints in walking distance. Upon trying the pizza, by our third visit/take out, we figured out that they have a one size fits all attitude that leaves much to be desired....bigger is not always better. It's a flavorless crust with greasier than necessary toppings. Then, we tried Charr, for burgers, since that's all they do, we were again hopeful that our burgers would be terrific. Such a pitiful excuse for a restaurant. First off, the server argued with my fiance about putting mustard on her turkey burger, and then neglected to honor my wish of medium for my burger. It was cooked all the way through, and the garlic knot bun is not a suitable vessel for the patty because it is too firm and crushed the toppings and it all squirts out. The service was so slow even though the place was almost empty during \"dinner rush.\" The fries are really small, and too salty, sweet potato were also a disappointment. To top it off, this evening, my fiance was at home and could hear loud band/bad karaoke sounding music (which we have been hearing Thurs-Sat. since memorial wknd it seems) come blaring through our back yard starting 8pm. She traced it's origin to Charr, and asked to speak to the mgr. Joe Aiello (owner) fielded the complaint. He was a page out of Kitchen Nightmares, first arguing with her that as a business he didn't have to honor her request. When she suggested he turn it down or reposition the speakers, so as to keep the other possible neighborhood customers happy and returning, he insisted that as a bar that having this band as entertainment was beneficial. He called her rude for asking, and started to pressure her and intimidate her toward the door, trying to kick her out, he just cant take the criticism. This is not the kind of customer service you would expect to be given to someone who could bring in a lot of repeat sales. He is extremely unprofessional and it shows throughout his establishments. The food, service and ambiance in general is all sub par and reflective of his attitude toward guests and the Moon Valley community. NEGLIGENT! We highly recommend skipping this place, just head to McDonalds. We will not be back!",

    "text": "UGH. That's the word that comes to mind when I think back on our visit to Char.  It was restaurant week and I can only assume that it was their first time participating judging by the fact that they ran out of half of the items on their menu.  The 3 things we wanted to order- guess what were out.  And the poor maybe a day over 16 year old waitress had no idea how to handle that.  We wanted the oysters, we were told they were out, so we said we take the chicken wings and guess what, they were out too!  So, of the appetizer choices we were forced into a crab cake.  This crab cake was mediocre at best. Crusty on the outside like a potato cake and mushy in the middle.  Gross.  We received potato pancakes with our meals that looked exactly like the crab cake- and just as disgusting.  When some older gentleman that I can only assume was an owner came by to check on us he noticed I had barely touched the potato cake.  When he asked me if I liked it, I began to respond with a \"not so much\" look on my face and he quickly ran off before I could even share my feedback with him.  This place needs to get it together. You obviously weren't ready for restaurant week or a serving food in general.",

We had the charr garlic chili glazed wings, easily in the top 3 wings of all time meaty, crispy, and the sauce was amazing, we actually had the waiter leave the plate of sauce so we could dip our fires in it. We had the Carolina BBQ Burger on a garlic knot instead of regular bun, which is a genius idea, and the truffle fries. We finished our meals with the apple crumb cobbler. Everything was amazing. Even though it was a far drive for us, we will be making the trek again just for those wings and burgers. Can't wait to try out the rest of their menu.",

The menu is packed full of great options, salads, burgers, sandwiches and sides. It really was a tough decision with all the great choices but  I went with the Belly Buster fork burger and my boyfriend had The Phoenix burger. Delicious. It hit the spot, cooked the way I wanted. Complete with that charred taste. They came on Garlic Knot Buns, just a hint or garlic taste if any. With these buns we noticed that they are a much hardier type of bun that won't become soggy after sitting as easily. Sturdy yet soft. Butter lettuce, tomato, and onion served on the side. When they say \"smothered\" they mean it.   We found a good Burger joint without having to treck across to downtown phoenix or scottsdale for an overpriced burger. No reason to go else where now :)",

Granted they tasted fine, but when you prefer your meat cooked a certain way, you'd hope it is. If you order, order well below how you like your meat, it will likely come out more done then expected.

In a nut shell, overpriced and the food was OK at best (nothing you can't make at home with some basic store bought ingredients).  Ordered a \"glorified\" grilled cheese which literally was a hunk of cheese between two pieces of bread with no real flavor and my wife ordered a chicken sandwich that was dry and hard to eat.  The sandwiches didn't even come with fries (for $10 bucks each you can give your customer .50 cents in fries).  Ordered the cream cheese filled poppers which literally tasted like they came out of a freezer and where dropped old oil.  Defiantly not impressed and wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "It was okay... First off, this place is in a strip mall - not the kind of place you expect to be asked \"do you have reservations?\" I think there is a little mismatch here. The decor is smart and clean, if a little bland. It screams \"American Bistro\" in a cookie-cutter manner. The good things? They have a raw bar and do oyster shots (which I found reasonably priced, too)! Their bar is denfinitely well-stocked and they have a select list of wines and local/ micro-brew beers and ales (San Tan Ale was my choice that evening and it didn't disappoint), the shots were served cold (Patron) with lime, but no one remembered the salt until it was requested (quibble if you will, but I do like salt and lime with most commercial tequila). The quality of the ingredients of the food is quite good, too. Now the bad part: It took over 35 minutes for my order to come out (a burger and fries, an oyseter shot) and when one of the people at the table asked for HER check (not \"the check\"), we got everyone's tab on it! WHat a nightmare. The server, who had been inattentive or disorganized all night never got better (hint: you will improve your tips if you don't call the men \"buddy\" and \"bro\" and if you don't call the women \"sweetie.\" Frankly, \"Sir\" and \"Ma'am\" work really well). And the burger was NOT rare, but to be fair, you really can't get a patty that thin to be rare and warm. Oh, and \"truffle fries?\" Meh. Truffle oil doesn't impress me, but the texture was right, not overcooked or undercooked with a nice crisp outside. The beef was tasty, but the patty surprisingly thin, even for a $10.00 burger. I'll go back, but I won't be in any hurry if I do and I'll ask for a different waitstaff if I get the same waiter. All in all, it seems like some of the staff could use a little more training in cadence and attentiveness but the food was pretty good. Oh, and lastly, the bathrooms in a place that is trying to be upscale should be in good repair - broken tp holders and a large unpainted patch job isn't consistent with the image this restaurant wants to project.",

    "text": "Not so much a review, but a chance to vent about about the negative experience we just had at Charr. The hamburgers are great and they have the best onion rings I've ever tasted. No complaints about the service. Nonetheless, our meal tonight was very uncomfortable. The owner paid for our meal and told us not to come back.  The hamburgers now automatically come with truffle fries, which is a step in the right direction as they are a bit pricey. My niece wanted to know if she could substitute sweet potato fries and pay a little extra. The waitress indicated that this was not their policy. However, she would ask the owner indicatiing he would not like it. The owner came to our table asking what was wrong. So my niece asked again. The owner indicated we were getting the fries for free. My husband indicated that he does not eat fries so they would be wasted. My niece said matter of factly, \"So you don't make exceptions.\" She did not say it in an accusatory mannter. This is when the owner's friendliness turned to hostility. He said that we would get everything we wanted on the house and added, \"Don't come back.\"  Maybe the owner had had enough complaints for the day. I don't think we were obnoxious. We were not asking for anything for free. We would have accepted, \"sorry no exceptions. We wouldn't have liked it, but it wouldn't have stopped us from coming back as the hamburgers are that good.  The restaurant refused to take our money even though we expected to pay. (Ironically we were using a Groupon.) I don't have complaints about the food or service; in fact I have recommended Charr to others who liked it. I am not advising anyone not to patronize Charr. The food is great, but the owner overreacted. We live in Sunnyslope and like to support local businesses. However, the owner made it very clear that he did not want or need our business.",

    "text": "Since we loved Aiellos so much, we had to support them and give this place a try! We ordered the Family Dinner to go from Aiello's Salumeria just down the sidewalk, and ate here while waiting for our food.   Bryan had the green chili burger while I had the pizza burger. We decided to order different ones so we could split and try both. The buns are actually garlic knots or something similar, but they are shaped like cinnabons in which the dough is spiraled all the way to the center. Unique fun idea but man, does this make for a horribly messy burger. You are forced to gobble up the burgers very quickly so they don't fall apart on you. The pizza burger was good, but I liked the chili one more just because there was more flavor to it. It's not that spicy either, so if you're afraid of spice, you are safe to order this chili one.   The restaurant and bar are very nice. I loved the dark woods and back lighting. The place is alot more trendy and fun in comparison to the rustic, yet charming older restaurant on Central Avenue close to Camelback. I'm hoping for this place to be a success, but I feel like there are a few more \"things\" that need to be worked out. Even if their burgers are just okay to most people it seems (after reading several previous reviews), let me assure you that their regular Italian food is their specialty and what they're amazing at!",

A few comments from my first (and last) visit to your restaurant: My girlfriend and I stopped on 05/12 around 4:20 pm for what we thought was going to be happy hour and dinner. We walked into an empty location, but it was early so no big deal being the only people there. We were seated in the dining room (where I wiped crumbs and food off the booth before I sat down... server didn't notice or care) and I asked the server if they had a happy hour menu. She said \"happy hour specials are only available at the bar and if you sit outside\". Kind of a surprise, but I get the idea. She then asked \"do you want to hear the happy hour specials\" and my response was \"well since we aren't sitting outside what is the point?\" She didn't seem to get the joke, and told us the specials anyway. Those included some deals on draft beer, wine, and food, but then she said there wasn't any tap beer tonight so it would be bottles on special. We looked around at a completely empty dining room and commented that it seemed odd to be so rigid on a happy hour (that ended at 5 according to your site) when there wasn't a single other person inside or outside. We didn't come in for cheap drinks, and we actually joked on the drive over that it was so close to the end of happy hour that we were prepared to pay full price anyway. The whole attitude of the place didn't communicate that we were appreciated as customers, the server and the other 2 staff seemed to be prepping or something else, so we opted to leave. Reading the reviews on various online blogs and the media articles, we expected much better. The food may be great, but the service and ridiculous \"happy hour rules\" will keep me from coming back to find out. I can only imagine what the response would have been if I had ordered something and asked for a substitution. We actually went to another option down the road and were thrilled with the experience. Having been in the hospitality industry in an executive position, I realize that things happen. I am simply writing to tell the owner of my experience, and what my observations were. In a competitive world where there are at least 30 other food options within half a mile of yours, the rigid rules, the poor service added to a dirty restaurant adds up in the customer's buying decision... it certainly did factor in mine tonight. My $50 plus dollars spent at a competitor seemed more appreciated by them than at your place.",

They were both attentive and kept our drinks full. I had the BBQ burger and it was great! Juicy, good toppings and not drenched in sauce. My buddy had the Charr burger ans said it was cooked well and very tasty. Actually heading back in a bit and wanted to let them know they are doing a great job!!",

Waitress walked up and dropped off a glass of water and disappeared for 10-15 min.  Finally came back and I ordered the Char burger with cheddar and an egg.  While waiting for lunch, I realized they were keeping the doors open and we had a bunch of flys bugging me and other diners.  It took at least 20+ minutes for lunch to be served.  The burger was bland at best and the cheddar cheese ....... What cheese?!?!  Picked up a buffalo chicken sandwich to go while eating to take home to the wife.  Her response to the food was equally unimpressed.  Payed my bill at the same time as 3 other tables. She rings everyone up I'm assuming and she brings every table their change except mine.  When she brings me the to go order she looks directly at me and asks, did you pay already?  I won't be returning.",

I would pass on this next time - Phoenix burger: a hint of heat, but otherwise meh. The bun is not a normal bun, but rather some sort of knotted bun that fell apart when I bit into it. It was definitely hard to eat. The meat was well-cooked though (hit right on med-rare). Truffle fries were thin and right on. They had perfect crunch - flat iron steak: coworker enjoyed it, as well as the green bean and potato cake side - lemontini: really tasty   The bartenders were great. Jill and Mimi were fantastic company. This is a solid place for good conversation and decent food, but definitely not the best burger I've had. I will say it is a place with great value. During their reverse happy hour ($3 well drinks, $3 off appetizers, $5 burgers), our total came out to $60 before tip. That was for 2 oyster shooters, 3 drinks, zucchini fries, phoenix burger, 2 raw oysters, and the flat iron steak. Not bad!",

We started with the chili glazed wings. Now I'm not much of a wing person but these were awesome - super crisp and the glaze was amazing. For our entrees I picked the mushroom & brie burger and my boyfriend got the phoenix burger which both came with truffle fries. The server failed to ask how we wanted our burgers done and without being asked I forgot to specify so I ended up with a well done burger which I'm not into. The flavors were there just the fact that it was overcooked ruined it for me. My boyfriend enjoyed his though. The fries were phenomenal! I love truffle fries and these were some of the best I've had, really thin and the perfect level of crisp. For dessert we got a slice of cheesecake - nothing special, but it was good. Decent experience overall.",

Before, the chicken was truly grilled and you would get an actual piece of breast. Today, the chicken was like the one that comes sliced in bags that are typically used for salads. My dad ordered the Buffalo burger and completely lacked seasoning. On top of it all, our table was dirty, there was no silverware, and our waitress never asked if we wanted refills.

Now I know.  The restaurant cuisine is modern American.  What I mean to say is that the food is basic American fare with a twist.    The restaurant has delicious hamburgers...........hence the name  - Charr.  The presentation is also modern as is the restaurant.  I rather enjoyed the Caesar's salad with REAL anchovies and a hamburger with REAL Swiss cheese and crimini mushrooms - yum!  My little one had the mac and cheese that was creamy and done perfectly.  My wife had the turkey burger which was juicy, not dry.  Our server was delightful and had a great sense of humor and was real likeable in general.  I would opt to say that the food is on a five star level.  However, the time to fill the order and receive the food must have been close to one half hour.  I was especially cognizant of the time since I have a seven year old that was hungry and making every minute after ordering count.  My advise to Charr, perfect the order time and you have a winner.  The restaurant offers many daily specials, including hamburgers.  Try it out!",

    "text": "My wife and I ate here because we were in the mood for 'fresh' hamburgers. When we arrived on a Sunday about 6:30pm, the place was almost completely empty. This scared me a little, but there was a local NFL game starting at that time (Cardinals vs Seahawks) and, it seems, everyone was at the game. I'm told the place normally has a wait to get in.  Inside, they have 4 large flat screen TVs (3 over the bar, 1 at the opposite corner) showing sports with closed captioning on (thank you!).  My wife and I each ordered burgers and she had a side of the Mac and Cheese. My burger came with fries.  The hamburger buns are very unique. They are like a swirled garlic bread. However, there was really no noticeable garlic taste, which is a good thing as far as I'm concerned. But each time I brought the burger up to my mouth, the aroma of garlic from the bread was quite nice.  The Mac and Cheese has elbow macaroni sitting a soup of a cheese blend that is more like how 'grandma used to make' then you might expect. It was, like the burgers, exceptional.  The fries are shoestring style (very thin, very crunchy) and everything tastes fresh (not frozen) and home made. The burgers are not uniform in shape or thickness, which tells me they are made by hand. Hallelujah!  The service was outstanding. The staff was extremely attentive. I noticed they have a 'Vernors Pound Cake' on the desert menu. Vernor's is a drink made in Detroit (where I was born and raised). I asked if the restaurant was Detroit-inspired and was told it's actually Brooklyn, New York-inspired and they really like Vernor's Ginger Ale in New York.   They also have a root beer float on the menu, so I asked the staff if they offer a Vernor's float instead. (A Vernor's float is known by folks in Detroit as a 'Boston Cooler' and its no different than a root beer float, except you substitute Vernor's for root beer.)  They never heard of it before (not shocking, since no one outside of Detroit has ever heard of it) but they were more than happy to make one for me. And it was delicious!  My wife thought the ice tea she ordered tasted a little off, but she didn't say anything to the staff. I have no doubt they would have made it right if she brought it to their attention.   She also ordered the Vernor's Pound Cake for desert. She thought it was too rich for her liking, but it wasn't bad by any means.  It appears the three restaurants beside each other are all owned and run by the same entity. There is Charr, then a pizza place (Isa's Pizza) and then a fine dining restaurant called Aiello's East Coast Italian.  There were plenty of items on the menu I wanted to try, such as baby back ribs and a grilled chicken sandwich. The pizza served next door looked good and Aiello's also looks like a nice place for us to try as well.  So we have four reasons to go back (try each of the other two restaurants, try other menu items at Charr, and if worse comes to worst, we would definitely go back to Charr and have REAL, fresh handmade burgers again! If I was going to open my own burger joint, this is similar to how I would do it.  There's only so many fast-food burgers one can ingest before desperately craving something that isn't factory made and doesn't require a loan to pay off. (our complete total for dinner and desert was $39 after tax. Quite reasonable and fair considering the quality and quantity of the food and the excellent service we received.)",

The manager on duty (blonde female) was completely short w/us because we complained about our waiter who we saw drinking a beer and smoking a cigarette by his truck minutes before we sat down. Usually when you go out to a restaurant you don't want your waiter smelling like a bar. Our food took over 30 minutes to get to our table and it wasn't busy. No refills on drinks until I had to get up and ask for refills. The food is good, but that is not good enough. A professional wait staff and a nice manager would be a good idea for this place. The owner of Charr would have been very disappointed with the managers attitude.",

Took him almost 10 mins to even bring us menus, he was too busy standing behind the bar talking to customers. Finally took our order after another 10 mins. We got talking and finally realized that our food wasn't coming even though others coming in after us had theirs. I had to go up to the waiter and ask if we were going to get our order. An older woman came in and was hustling around, accomplishing more than our waiter! Joe finally came in, came to our table, and while assuring us that there would be no charge for our lunch had to ask what our order had been.  This is 50 minutes after we came in!  He was full of excuses and repeatedly asked us not to yelp him.  Sorry Joe but the public needs to know and you need to pay attention to the number of recent bad reviews. I ordered your Phoenix Burger and it was tasteless, maybe because it had to be cooked so quickly. You never even asked about why I didn't finish it in spite of standing next to me and seeing 3/4 of the burger sitting on my obviously finished with plate! Your waiter never, ever apologized to us. Everybody has bad days in business but take note, apologies go a long way to getting people to try you again.  Fire that waiter, get a better cook, and apologize when your staff screws up.",

    "text": "This place was terrible! The first thing that I noticed when I sat down was the floor was wet. I figured they had just mopped, boy was I wrong! As I was sitting there during my meal a drip of water caught my eye. I looked up and the duct work was leaking! There was water all over the exposed duct work in the ceiling and it was leaking on floor! Gross imagine if that landed in my food or on me.   Now about the food. First it was way over priced. Each item is sold separately. I looked at the drink menu and almost fell over. A cocktail is on average $8. I ordered the 5 cheese melt (sounds yummy right? WRONG) When the sandwich came to the table it looked horrible! Just a large mound of cheese on tiny bread. When I opened the sandwich the inner layers of cheese weren't even melted. I took a bite (thinking it was going to clog my arteries the whole time) and it didn't even have any flavor! A grilled cheese I make at home tastes better. I didn't even finish a half of a half and the waitress never even acknowledge that I didn't even touch my meal.   I will never go here again. Moral of the story... overpriced, gross food and who knows whats dropping into the food as it's being walked around the room.",

If this restaurant was in Scottsdale it would probably work well. But this is at 7th st and Thunderbird. Prices here are outrageous. Burger, fries and a drink is about $18. I'm not exaggerating prices either. My wife ordered the 5 cheese sandwich and it was bad. Just a huge blob of cheese on some bread. Extremely flavorless cheese log. I will not be back to this place and really want my $40 back.   If you notice, the only good reviews on this restaurant all refer to the owner Joe so these are all his friends and of course they are going to give a 5 star review.  Heed my advice and go somewhere else. $6 for a side of fries!!!! I still can't believe this.",

    "text": "We're planning on going to Wild Tuna next door but unfortunately they didn't open until 5pm. My boyfriend and I decided to try Charr- we walked into an empty dining area with only 2 people sitting at the bar. Figured we could have a quick bite and be in and out easily... Turns out not so much. The server looked like we had annoyed her by even being there. 30 minutes later, my pulled pork sandwich came out dry like it was sitting under the heat lamp for about 20 of those minutes. Mind you- we were literally 1 of 2 tables in the place. I attempted to just power through but the meat was so chewy and rubbery that it was unbearable. My boyfriends burger came out very well done after initially asking for it to be medium. He decided to send his back to the kitchen only to be given an eye roll from the server and uncomfortable stares from the kitchen staff (the kitchen is open to the dining area). About 10 minutes later the burger came back out to only be cooked \"well\" again. My boyfriend decided to just eat it this time and found it to be tough and tasteless.To make a long story short- every single staff member we had the privilege of being in contact with there made us feel as if we were annoying them from start to finish. I will never recommend this place to anyone and will not be going back. It makes so much sense as to why I never really see many people in the restaurant from the street. These people really need to get it together.",

It has a great location in morth Phoenix and hosts a beautiful fire pit fitted outisde patio, but was a little chilly for outside dining that night. We opted for a table in the middle of the place, my only complant was that I got the chair and my sister got the booth. In the chair, I felt like I was a foot above her and it was a little uncomfortable to sit that way.  None the less, the service was fantastic. We each ordered drinks and were hand delivered by a nice bartender. We could see the hustle and bustle of the kitchen from our seats and with an open air kitchen like that it really fills the room with the right amount of noise. We got an app, friend zucnini with ranch dipping sauce. They were alright. I wish they had a bigger crunch when you bite in but they also cut really nicely for nibbling perfection.   I got the The Buffalo Chicken while my sister orded the Grilled Chicken. Mine came with the most melty, amazing, mouth watering white cheese. That was my favorite part. The bread was great and the chicken too. Not enough buffalo sauce but the blue cheese dipping sauce was on point.  The place is owned by the funny Italian guy and he was just hanging around the place. He speaks poor english but is super friendly and will always ask you how your meal was. I'd go back.",

I ordered this amazing chicken sandwich that had zucchini, grilled onions, cheese an some other delicious veggies. It was literally the best sandwich I ever had. The only problem was that it had so many wonderful veggies on it that it kept falling out of the bread which I was fine with! I also had the sweet potato fries which were perfect and the bar tender made me the perfect Moscow mule. They have s ton of shakes as well and was gonna come back for one but I was just so full. My eyes were larger than my stomach. Totally am going back. Quaint atmosphere. Great food. Great service",

The reviews here didnt seem all that great but we live close by and found a groupon for their wings and 4 drinks (beer, wine or mixed) for only $18!   Wings = outstanding! The spicyness of the wings does build up and make it almost unbearably hot (to me) but the chili sauce they put on them is delish!   Alcohol = we had a few of their drafts which were pretty good: Purple Hazed (something like that), Mission Lager, Sweaty Betty, and Four Peaks Kiltlifter, yummy!!  Staff: friendly and attentive; family owned i think? even the owner/ chef came up to us a couple times while we were at the bar to make sure the bartender was treating us well (his son apparantly)   Atmosphere: upscale, romantic, really nice!!   Prices: expensive if you don't come here for happy hour! We gave in and tried \"The Phoenix\" burger and it was amazing!!  It is expensive considering they don't include a side with your burger but the food is awesome and worth a try!",

They are doing this thing where there is a jukebox that is the only source of aural ambience in the place. When no one is paying to hear music the place feels really dead, you can hear the clinking of cutlery from the kitchen - makes we want to leave. The bathrooms don't seem very clean.

They were definitely not hand shaped which made me wonder if they were frozen or just pre made in either case our order should not have taken so long. Five burgers two beers and our bill was $140!

The food is also not as good they used to have delicious garlic knot kind of buns. now they taste like bag of 8 buns that you get at Fry's for .99 gents. for a 12 dollar burger you will have to forgive me but I expect a little more. this is unfortunate that they have gone so far downhill I used to really like to go here.

    "text": "While having to wait for an unexpected car repair, my friend and I chose Charr since it was close to my mechanic.  Not a big fan of the industrial decor, but if the food is good I can live with it. Well - ugh!  A far cry from a burger joint, the menu was uninspired. We ordered the basic Charr burger -  one medium rare, the other medium well and got them cooked exactly the same. The garlic bun was intriguing but we both would have preferred them warmed a little. Ketchup served as the condiment of choice? I would prefer Thousand Island Dressing and maybe toss in a couple pickles. Neither of us had ever tasted Truffle fries, and I can honestly say I will never bother seeking them out. The muscle bound staff stood like guardians at the path to the restrooms. My friend braved the trail past them, announcing she had been in better restrooms in gas stations. I decided to skip the use of the facilities. I think a staff could at least \"fake\" busy so you don't feel like cattle being surveyed by prospective bidders at an auction. Charr is totally off the list of restaurants, and I wouldn't bother trying any of the sister restaurants. I can understand why people find their reservations available - it's because no one really goes there. Too many good burgers in town - I've learned to accept a $10.00 burger like I accept gasoline over $3.50 a galloon. The difference is, I have to buy gas - but I can get good food elsewhere for that $10.00.  I only wish I was in possession of one of their coupons they put out regularly. A painful experience is better with a coupon.",

Had the fish & chips & fries and it was great.  The fish was so mild and fresh and the breading was delicious...not over breaded.  My husband had the burger and I tasted it (of course) and agreed with him, that it was a winner.  The dessert we had was the blueberry bread pudding with whiskey sauce and it was a home run!!  Of course, the best part of the whole experience was Brian, who always took care of us at Aiello's and now is at Charr.  We will definitely be returning.....many times!!",

    "text": "My husband and I came in on a Friday night around 8 pm.. The bar area and dining room were dimly lit and to our surprise almost empty. We were told to take a seat. We sat and waited for our server until I believed to have been forgotten. We flagged a waitress down. She took our drink orders and sent our server to our table. Our drinks arrived 10 mins later. The mint was fresh in my Mojito however the limes in both our drinks were discolored and unpleasant looking.  A waitress came over beside our table and started polishing dinnerware and talking on her cell phone in a very loud manner. I wished she would have chosen a different table away from us to do this task as there were many others to chose from.  Our burgers arrived with a side of thin cut, crispy fries and burger fixins. We topped our burgers with the veggies only to realize that the chipotle mayo was missing. Our server apologized and bought us the condiment.  My husband and I each had a hard time eating our burgers. The kaiser roll they came on was just too tough for our liking.  With eat bite we took the inside of our burgers would push out into our hands. I ended up dumping my burger contents on my plate and just eating the patty. The patty itself tasted charred and was a very nice quality beef. They were cooked to our liking. The experience in this restaurant was okay, far from the worst and far from the best. Pretty much just a 'meh' experience.",

Not only was the hostess seated,but we had to ask to be seated outside. The hostess never offered inside or outside seating.  Walking outside we noticed the many dirty tables, and the trash from previous customers littering the floor. In addition to the dirty tables, there was broken glass lying on top. The glass came from the lightbulbs above. So we moved inside.  Once inside  we were seated near a server station where you could hear the servers and hostess cursing. In addition to the foul language I witnessed a sever chasing the hostess around the restaurant with a dead bug!  I had ordered a beer on draft which was poured into a warm glass so with in minutes the beer was room temp and unpleasant. We both had burgers of course. I had ordered mine med rare and my girlfriend had ordered hers med well,both came out over and under cooked. For a burger bar I would think you would train your cooks to cook a burgers to order properly.  Truffle fries were nothing special have had better. And finally the bathrooms where so gross that most dive bars bathrooms where better then there's!! Overall would not recommend this place to anyone.",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Charr a few weeks ago.  I purposefully waited to write this since we wanted to re-try a couple of other places nearby for comparison.  We had 2 wedge salads, 2 burgers, an order of onion rings and 3 beers.  $60.  In the next two weeks we went to a nearby sports bar/Italian place and a brewpub.  For similar quantities, the price was $35 at one place and $38 at the other, both similar quality.  I have a hard time justifying the higher price tag, especially considering how loud it was at Charr, it was difficult to have a conversation.  The beer selection is good, but overpriced as was the case with everything.  Doing a la carte will be a tough sell when that is not what everyone else does.  We may return but not often unless the value gets better.  I wish them well but would encourage them to consider some changes that will price them more competitively.",

Men's bathroom was run down (faucet falling off the wall), dirty, and smelled like stale urine....I understand it is a bathroom but it doesn't have to smell that way!

This establishment is no where near trendy enough to be running these kind of prices. I have bar tending experience and have travelled enough to know when to pay those prices and Charr is not it.  Happy hour ran from 330-500(or close to that). This didn't make much sense to me...during the week most people are barely out of work by 5.

    "text": "Wow. wOw. WOW. Did I say WOW, cuz WOW. And I mean wow in the best possible way! Party of 7 came by on a Friday night with no expectations, no reservations, and a 2 year old which can usually spell out a recipe for disaster but boy did Charr impress!   We were seated right away at a perfect size table and greeted immediately by our very friendly and very competent server. We received info on the specials as well as tips for first timers. Our drinks came right away and our server was even conscientious enough to ask if we should bring the 2 year old's food right away! (YES PLEASE!). Mr. Aiello himself came by to greet us twice and make sure that everything was perfect.   So, what did we have? I can tell you, I had one of the best salmon burgers I've ever had in my whole life. A delicious, perfectly cooked filet atop the most delicious house made garlic knot bun. What I loved most was the fact that the bun never got soggy from the lemon basil mayo sauce and the arugula was so fresh I'd swear that it was snipped that day!  The salmon was perfectly done. The baby had housemade macaroni and cheese that every adult at the table swore was the best ever. I think we might all have it next time as a main dish ourselves. 4 different cheeses mixed in the sauce and topped with a slice of cheddar and baked to perfection. O.M.G. Several of the grown-ups had the Phoenix Burger and the Charr Burger. Everyone said the burgers were DE-LIC-IOUS and cooked to perfection since so many of us have different degrees of doneness that we prefer.  Final friend had the pork tenderloin and while that fell a tad short versus the burgers, the overall dining experience left her feeling 5 star all the way.   Dessert was also superb. I had the Strawberries and Zabaglione sauce while others had the Apple Cobbler served hot with vanilla ice cream. All were super yum.   While this restaurant is very out of the way for us, we will definitely be making an effort to go out of our way again to visit Charr very very soon.  Thank you for a great experience and excellent food!",

    "text": "From other reviews, this is a hit-or-miss place.  As Charr is near where we live and restaurant choices are not very good, we gave this try on a Wednesday night.  Easy parking.  Great ambiance.  Nice patio with a fire pit.  Got seated promptly.  Good start.  Water came.  Weren't familiar with the menu so we didn't order immediately.  Took a long time for the server to come back.  My water glass was empty again. We ordered a burger with avocado extra ($1).  Our menus were different and it wasn't clear that fries came with your order. It does in most places.  Ordered a flat-iron steak sandwich with bleu cheese---very good.  Enough for two small appetites.  The burger was overdone; no avocado, and a dried out bun.  A pile of \"truffle\" fries were placed in the middle of the table.  No dipping sauce (most upscale places offer that).  Wait staff was scarce in an almost empty restaurant.  Had to leave the table and go into the restaurant from the patio to get a check.  Commented that I felt invisible.  The waiter chuckled (wrong emotion). He gave us a small discount.  One can run up a big check here when you add in drinks and side orders of fries. But the quality does not justify these prices.   We are very generous tippers when service is good.  Our tip:  $0.00.  Another tip: Avoid this place.  Finally, a friend shopping at the nearby Safeway ran into a customer buying truffle oil spray (an employee from Charr).  They spray the oil on the friends--voila truffle fries.  Can't imagine this place surviving with service and practices like this to go with high prices.",

I sat at the bar and the bartenders we very friendly. I ordered the fried zucchini and a blue moon. They are very generous with the zucchini even though it is only an appetizer and the beer was cold and refreshing. The zucchini came with a side of ranch, but I prefer marinara, which they did not have, but they were able to accommodate me with their pomodoro soup which is very similar. I will definitely be going back and bringing friends. :)",

The buns were stale, the meat was less than decent, and the fries were comparable to Burger King. They had clear signage in the dining area boasting reverse happy hour with no mention of \"their unique rule\". This place flat sucked, myself and the wife could've spent nearly $100 elsewhere and left happy, but instead we left as if we were robbed. Who ever gave this place 3 or more stars has obviously no clue as to what a dining experience consists of. Thumbs down!!!! Twice!!!",

    "text": "When this restaurant first opened my wife and I were fans and since we were moving back to Moon Valley we were excited that MV was going to get a new good restaurant since there aren't many.  We got the Carolina Burger and the garlic knot bun was a great idea. The burger was juicy and delicious. The truffle fries were the perfect side for it as well. Anything truffle I'm a sucker for.  Last night we went again after a few months and it seems they forgot the butter and garlic on the buns and the truffle on the fries. The burger was pretty dry due to the dry bun and lack of any garlic and butter so it was just a knot bun really.   Not sure if it was a bad night, but if I truly hope they pick up the quality again because I want them to succeed here.  I'll give it one more shot and if it's good again, I'll be happy to update this review with 5 stars that I would've given it a few months ago when I first ate here.",

The waiter was friendly but somewhat unattentive and tried to push the other restaurants/deli on to us quite a bit. The food was pretty mediocre but edible..no complaints. I'm not a huge string fry fan so I was hoping for some thicker cut \"chips\". The blueberry bread pudding was okay. It tasted like they used old garlic bread from the other restaurant next door then smothered it in whiskey and butter. We went about 15-20 minutes without a water refill and waited 10 minutes for our card to be picked up. All in all it was just okay but at least now we know and it only cost us $30. I guess that's what Restaurant Week is all about though right?",

The staff were super friendly and helpful because this was our first time eating here.  Service was good speed, and no mistakes were made.   To the food, Nicholas order their signature burger, and we split their mac and cheese... which was absolutely amazing! It's definitely not the best I had, but close enough.. and I highly recommend it.  I also order some wings which was okay, they were really tough to chew.   Overall a good place.

I've had a different waitress each visit however, they both seemed so uninterested in being at work. Also the yelp hours listed never seem to match what they're open. Last time as we were leaving another couple showed up thinking they were open till 10 weekdays.   Here's the saddest part, I love the location and the menu. But the wait staff is so unwelcoming it's amazing. First visit ( we think they're open till 10(yelp listed) we show up at 8:15. At 8:45 while eating our entrees the waitress turns off the fire and starts closing down. Ok ok we're done can we have a box?  Tonight our waitress had three tables (all outside) we ordered a salad and an appetizer and twenty minutes later they show up with our entree right behind when we ordered them at least 10 minutes apart. Our waitress spent the majority of her time in at the bar with the other staff eating pasta from a to go container from somewhere.   Ok also don't order the veggie burger. I know I know it's a meat place, but I was trying to make a healthy option tonight. Tasted like when I tried a Pinterest fail recipe. Just get a burger.",

I ordered the grilled vegetables but did not like the flavor of them so I asked about 9:50 if I could have the fries instead when she went back to tell him she needed Fry's he had already drained the fryer and could not make my fries.

    "text": "We decided to try this burger place a month ago after a good review from a coworker.  We come to Phoenix for business frequently, and come to CABG frequently whenever we are in town.   Our waiter Kenny, was attentive and funny!  He helped to make the night.  The food was delicious we loved the pickle chips, and our burgers were great.  Our waiter, Kenny brought our food promptly and in the right order, perfectly timed.  We have been back since and actually requested to be seated in Kenny's section.  WE have decided to make this one of our go to places whenever we visit.   However, the beer could be more reasonably price, but we solved that by having water and soda. We highy recommend this restaurant.  If your waiter can't make it right the manager also seemed helpful after observing him at another table.  Luckily we didn't have any problems with our waiter!  update: visited again a few weeks ago and asked for Kenny's section.  He remembered us and made us feel welcome.  This time we had a game of pool to relax.  Still as happy with food and server!",

I decided to give it one more shot due to the quality of the food and beverages. Finally, I was not disappointed! My server, Ashley was wonderful. Not too overbearing, but ver friendly and present. She paid attention to details, and fulfilled every need I have. I am glad that I can continue to come here! Ashley gets 5 stars! Due to previous experiences, I am giving 4 to Charr.",

This most recent visit, the hostess seated us and I asked for a reminder on what the WiFi password was (I'm not a total douche...my wife and I run a small biz together and commonly work over meals and drinks).  The hostess kinda curtly said she didn't know if the place even has WiFi (I knew it did) and didn't know the password if it did.   No effort to go get it.  Finally waited for a server, who vaguely thought she knew it.  I'm not in the HRM industry, except as a consumer, but I can't imagine not training my staff on this.  Love the ambiance and food. Just disappointing service in my 3 visits.  The servers at Ammacapanne's still win the day in this area for me.",

I have never dealt with such unethical business practice. Just because an employee quits or does a no call no show because you refuse to allow her to call out sick you automatically ban them from eating there and the people they bring in... I was planing on buying the $14 burger a side of mac and cheese and a few mixed drinks.. So you lost a few customers.. Great owner..",

    "text": "I went to Charr for the second time. I was with my father who lives in nearby Moon Valley. He was eager to try Charr after a neighbor recommended it. It was a complete failure.   GOOD NEWS: burgers now come with side of  fries for the same price.   BAD NEWS: The service was horrible. We just ordered burgers. I had the Carolina (with bbq sauce ON THE SIDE) he ordered the Phoenix burger. In only a few minutes our food was brought out by a someone from the kitchen. They asked, \"who had the Carolina?\" and set the plate in front of me when I responded and then gave the other burger to my father.   My burger had BBQ on it (not on the side as I ordered) had it came on the side I would not have touched it. My fathers burger was just a plain cheese burger. We figured that we got someone else' order as it came out so fast. My father told the waitress about his lack of \"Phoenix\" in his burger and she went to the kitchen before I could get to my BBQ sauce issue or our theory of it being for a different table. Someone came from the kitchen and took the \"Phoenix\" burger away and came back 20-30 seconds later with roasted pepper on it and left. We got the waitress again to say that it still didn't have the chipotle mayo and she left immediately to get some despite me trying to tell her about the bbq burger I did not want.   We told the waitress when she came back with the mayo that my burger had bbq on it and not on the side, but rather than having them recook my burger (they took my burger away but left my father to eat his) we just abandoned the meal. Also we never got flatware and/or napkins the entire time.   Overall we spent 3 or 4 times longer trying to get our servers attention and get the order fixed (not including time it would take to fix mine had we stayed) than it took to get the food after we ordered.   We are not picky eaters nor complainers. But they failed to do accommodate our one simple request (no bbq) and also simply forgot two components (the only two things that make it a \"Phoenix\" burger rather than a cheese burger) on another and made it a circus trying to fix them rather than just simply scrap the two burgers and remake them again correctly.   The whole experience made me think that they just did not give a s**t. Little to no effort by the waitress and how can a kitchen claim they make great burgers if their solution to missing components it just to add them several minutes after they serve the food.",

Went on a hot Monday evening about 6ish to find only two tables (both with seniors) occupied...uh oh. After reading mixed reviews we grumbled on the way in how our dining experience was going to be. Wrong!  Was immediately greeted and seated. Menu is fairly short so it didn't take long. French Onion for me, Crab Cake Sandwich for him, Charr Burger+ American cheese for the 10 year old.  My husband's soda was flat but my son's wasn't. Uh oh. Waitress kindly brought another. Food took a little longer than average due to the fact it wasn't busy.  When the food arrived it was without the fries, which our waitress said was on the way. She was correct, they arrived shortly there after. My soup was smoking and I mean smoking hot. I loved my soup, it was almost perfect. Onions were cut fairly small and it wasn't overloaded with cheese like FOS is sometimes. My husband's crab cake sandwich was damn near picture perfect. Lots of arugula with a small drizzle of the \"tartar sauce\". My son's burger was thick, a little over cooked and accompanied with a fresh tomato slice, onion and butter lettuce. Those fries are amazing and worth the trip! Thin, crispy and salty.  Our drinks were never empty and our server was personable, I think her name was Ashley.  We will definitely be back to Charr we thought the food was great and with just a few minor tweaks it would have been a 5 star experience.",

I hate to say but we will not be back after last night-I went in last night and sat at the bar-I recognized the bartender who I had walked out on once before because of poor service-I went ahead and sat at the bar hoping this time would be better and I would not be overlooked like the last time-well once again the service was horrible-I watched for 25min(not exaggerating)while the bartender would bring food to other patrons or drinks that were sitting only 1 barstool away from me-the bartender never acknowledging me or even looked over to let me know they knew I was there but would be right with me look-so on that note I actually had to get the bartenders attention so I could get the tab for the beer they didn't even know they had on the menu-and the bartender was surprised when I asked for the bill but then realized why-the bartender apologized and took care of my $5.00 tab but that did not help at that point-Joe should spend more time in the kitchen then out greeting people-maybe a staff meeting once a month-something, anything to get the staff excited to be there-I have watched that place go through countless employees and the service is still crappy-the food is also going downhill-maybe close the place down and stick to making pizza-I Will now make the 5 min drive over to the tavern on 32nd st and Shea where service and food are way better-peace out Char",

Wings ($9.50) were so covered in sweet chili sauce I literally was salvaging them with napkins. I ate one and was unable to stomach the rest.   I had two cocktails, both ordered during happy hour. My bill had three drinks 1x$10 2x11  I kindly expressed my food quality issue and the waitress asked me if she could box the wings. What? No sorry, no offer to make new ones.. nothing.   When I asked why the bill stated two prices for the drinks, she stated that I made a mistake about the time I ordered it.. (after happy hour)  So.. I left. I called and asked for the manager and he was defensive like a child would be.   I can't remember a time, ever, that I've felt bent over by the service industry.   Do yourself a favor and eat at ziggys or literally anywhere other than this place. The energy is bad.",

    "text": "We went here years ago but decided to give it another go the another night after hearing about Charr Cade...they have opened the other side up with some games such as pool and our teen wanted to play.  Unfortunately they charge to play so we passed.  We started out with an order of fried pickles and a beer. They do have a large selection of beer with something for everyone. My husband ordered a burger loaded with bacon and make and cheese, my son had the basic Charr burger and I had the buffalo chicken sandwich. I really did not like my sandwich at all. The chicken was on the rubbery side and the sandwich would fall apart and drip buffalo sauce everywhere every time you tried to take a bite. The little that I ate I had to eat with a fork. The truffle fries were decent though even though they didn't show up until several minutes after our burgers were served. My husband and son liked their burgers which is how they ended up with 3 stars.  The service was a bit spotty as it took a bit to be seated when we arrived even though they were fairly empty and the server was slow with refills and taking our order but it does seem to be a good local spot to grab a beer.",

    "text": "First off, maybe this is biased as I worked here... but why not give it a go.   I'm giving this place a 3 star rating, for good reason.   First off, their food is pretty good. They use natural hamburger with literally no seasonings, yet it's super good. Their fries are to die for. All of their salads, appetizers, and drinks are pretty good. I liked the menu!   The management can be tough to handle. Joe, the owner is a True New Yorker which means he is rough and tough. He has ZERO filter, and a lot of times he made me feel awful. I can handle my grit, but not being yelled at while busy. It just shouldn't happen. The people that work there are pretty down to earth and I got a long with 97% of them. When it's busy though, it can be understaffed as they don't believe in putting wait times out. Which, I think would help. When you're busy and get sat 4x in 10 minutes... someone is going to get forgotten. It's inevitable. The restaurant is pretty cramped on a Friday night when it's busy.   The alcoholic drinks are pretty pricey TBH. Even on happy hour. They need to re-evaluate that. They need to have a good team on, but it's hard in the environment. You should be able to trust your co-workers and management.   If you go here, enjoy the food and atmosphere. Joe and Myrah did good at trying to liven the place up. I don't go out much, but I would love to see how things have come along since opening up the \"game\" area.",

The restaurant looked dirty, sticky floors and tables, dirt and dust and the peek into the kitchen worried me. When the food came out, I was very underwhelmed. A $2 upcharge for a side salad that was just a few pieces of lettuce, red onion and tomato, so I asked for cucumber slices and they came out yellow and charged an extra $1.50. It wouldn't have been annoyed if you got fries in addition to, but that wasn't the case. $14,50 for a chicken sandwich and the piece of chicken was small, heavily breaded and tough. The small $5 milkshake for my niece's birthday (no dessert offered to celebrate) was bland and she only drank a few sips. Best food ordered was the chicken wings, so I'd recommend that if you do find yourself here. Won't be back.",

    "text": "Hit up Charr: An American Burger Bar this evening for Arizona Restaurant Week 2018!  Not only was it my first time at Charr, but it was my first time participating in Arizona Restaurant Week!  So the premise behind Arizona Restaurant Week is it allow us (the consumers) to try new restaurants and new menu items at a somewhat discounted rate.  My wife and I paid $33 for us as a couple for an appetizer that we shared, two entrees and a dessert that we also shared.  Drinks and anything else are excluded.  The restaurant is in a little strip mall of sorts right on Thunderbird in Phoenix.  Very convenient location with plenty of ample parking!  The first thing I noticed when I walked in was this gigantic chalkboard in front of me that said - MILKSHAKE BAR.   Sold!  ...except, I wasn't there for a milkshake, but it sounded good.  I may need to come back for a milkshake at some point in time.  Forget about the milkshake for now.  Anywho, the restaurant was clean and do not let the word \"bar\" fool you.  Yes, there just happens to be a bar in the restaurant, but I would not call it a bar, per se and we were not there to do any heavy drinking, anyway.   Back to my review... we were seated right away and considering it was a Friday evening during Arizona Restaurant Week, I was pleasantly surprised.  Music was playing and it was loud enough to hear the lyrics, but not loud enough so that you couldn't hear yourself think or carry on a conversation with your hot date.     We were waited on promptly and our drinks were brought very quickly.  We knew more or less what we wanted so it did not take long for our food to begin piling up on our table.  For our appetizer, we went with Panko Parmesan Zucchini.  The panko was golden brown, crispy and delicious.  The zucchini was still crispy and not mushy.  It was very green and fresh!  So delicious!  The perfect appetizer that didn't leave you feeling stuffed.  It was the perfect start to our meal.  For my entree, I opted for the salmon burger.  You can probably tell from my other reviews that I absolutely heart salmon .  I mean, I could seriously eat salmon every day of the week if my wallet allowed it.  The salmon was grilled to perfection and quite fresh.  It wasn't skunky like salmon can be and it wasn't dried out like it can be so easily.  On top of the salmon was a hefty bed of fresh mixed greens in addition to several slices of fresh red onion, a couple slices of tomatoes and several pieces of fresh butter lettuce.  Soooo good!  The bun was fresh, warm and awesome.  I've had several salmon burgers and this one from Charr is one I'd recommend for Restaurant week!  The burger was accompanied by a small trough of skinny fries.  They appear to love the use of parmesan cheese as the french fries much like the panko zucchini was lightly sprinkled with salt and parmesan cheese.  An awesome compliment to my salmon burger!  For dinner, I was hoping to obtain the cobbler, but sadly enough, they were sold out of it.  We instead opted for the brownie which was baked fresh in-house and still warm and then smothered with a large helping of vanilla ice cream.  I don't think I need to go into gory details about the brownie.  I would've taken a photo of it, but my lovely wife dug into it faster than you can say \"restaurant week\".  I'm pretty much stuffed right now, but terribly happy.  The perfect start to our Memorial Day weekend as we're thinking about our veterans and those who paid the ultimate sacrifice.  I will end this review by saying I would highly recommend a visit to Charr.  I know Arizona Restaurant Week is ending this weekend, but a visit to Charr is still a worthwhile endeavor for your next meal out with family and/or friends.  The service was pleasant, quick and polite.  The food... well, I think I discussed the food enough and I think you'll be pleasantly surprised just as I was.  Thanks for having us and thanks for letting us spend Restaurant Week with you guys!",

Server was so overly friendly & enthusiastic that it was annoying- after finally getting my fries, he came by & asked if the fries were \" just as fabulous\" as the burger. Seriously? No they were not fabulous. They were greasy and didn't taste like they had even a hint of truffle oil on them...  Not a good experience at all. Why is it called Charr? My burger had no char on it.

He makes everyone feel like family. It has a great neighborhood feel. The food is very good. Their fried pickles, French onion soup, wings, turkey burger, and fruit/nut salad are our regular orders.  All solid! We love and appreciate good beer and they have a healthy variety of local beers as well as robust offering of craft beers. Their vodka selection is perfect as well. Next door is the Chaarcade which offers specialty nights like open night, trivia, and poker. We love this place and love Kenny.",

Charr  was decent but not overwhelmingly good.  The atmosphere is nice... I like the decor. Most of the servers are attractive young males.  I had a Moscow Mule which was refreshing and potent. I thought the drinks, including the beer were overpriced.  My husband ordered the Charr burger, cooked medium rare. He said it came medium well. He still thought the beef tasted good though.   I ordered the roasted veggie sandwich. It was okay. The aioli that came on it was delicious. The bun that both my sandwich and my husband's burger came on was good and I liked the idea but it came apart on both of us.  The fries were thin and crispy and yummy but our server only brought out one serving for us to share. I noticed other tables of two each had their own serving... hmmmm. Luckily we were more than full despite sharing one serving of fries.  Service was good except for when my husband had to flag someone down for some mayo after getting our food. It took a solid 5 minutes.   Our total bill before the Groupon discount for 2 burgers, fries, and 2 alcoholic beverages was around $45. A little overpriced for a burger date night.  We will return for happy hour. The drinks were tasty and I am eager to try some of their appetizers.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch when I first moved to the area.  Will agree with some of the previous reviewers to say service was slow but not anything painful.  It was just a laid back type slow, but I could see how it would get on people's nerves.  Overall both me and my moms hamburgers were good quality cooked correctly and had interesting topics.  Their fries are great!! This is trying to have a more gourmet type feel for the area and maybe people are not prepared for it.  I liked it and the atmosphere is funky.  Would definately take friends and family back.",

    "text": "You would expect a burger place named Char would know how to cook a burger to temperature, but sadly they seem to have a consistent problem with this. Now, that's not to say it wasn't a decent burger, but are there burger joints that do it better? You bet! Hop Doddys and Rehab Burger both in Scottsdale, I think cook a slightly better burger. That being said, why did I rate Char a 4? The service is what kicks this place up a notch. Everyone is so welcoming, including the owner who is from NY and walks the dining room asking his customers how their meal was. Oh, and the fries were pretty good too. The only downsides so far are the burgers and the hostess who walks around like she's on Xanax. I mean, come on, if you're going to hire a hostess then hire one who has a bit more pep and enthusiasm. Honestly, she looked positively bored.",

    "text": "Well I finally got around to doing a writeup on charr. The reviews here seem mixed so I had to check it out for myself. The first thing I noticed was the setup -- the multi-color backlit bar and the nice flat-screen LED tvs. I'm a big football fan so I will be sure to come by to eat and never miss a game!   I came for dinner and was seated very quickly by the hostess. Menu had a wide selection of appetizers, salads, soups and drinks. Went for the charrburger with some custom toppings to my liking, beer on tap, and crab cakes to start. Some other reviews mentioned about price but having sampled other places in phoenix like Delux  I found the prices to be quite on par. More on what I think of the value later.  I got my crab cakes to start and they were excellent! Very moist, tasty and hit the spot. Next was my burger and it was quite a burger. The garlic knot bun turns out to be the differentiator between the other joints I ate at so I give charr the nod on the taste of the burgers. I thought the food was excellent and certainly of the best I have had.  Whether it is charr or the other burger places I sampled that serve high quality gourmet burgers, I think the price is very reasonable. This is not processed meat and the quality of the food, the ambiance where I can kick back and watch the games on the flat screen tvs and hang with my buddies makes it well worth the price. I dont plan on coming every night but at the end of a hard week of work it's nice to have a place to hang with both my buddies and colleagues for some drinks and/or food. If I want a cheap burger I can always get a big mac at the other end of the mall but I always regret it later when I choose fast food over quality.  Overall, I enjoyed my meal and the atmosphere and the service. I liked the other burger joints I have been trying as well but give the nudge to charr. I'd say try it out for yourself. Tip: waited at the bar for buddies to arrive afterwards for drinks and surprisingly found some cool outlets right under the bartop I could charge my pda while waiting. Very hard to find outlets to charge my phone while I am out so this was a nice bonus! They are kind of hidden under the counter so not sure this is well known!",

Then 5 minutes later I get a call stating they are out of crab cakes. Again 5 minutes ago I asked if everything else was okay.  First it took over an hour for my food to get delivered Then I get my ribs (not even what I originally wanted ) and I would say I was and am very underwhelmed.

I have had the buffalo chicken sandwich and on this trip I had the Carolina burger. The fresh handmade garlic bun is an awesome addition to any burger. I have zero complaints as far as food goes.  Food gets 4 stars.   My issue with this place is the service, or lack there of. Upon arrival there were two other tables that were occupied. It still took 10 minutes to get a drink. 15-20 minutes after that we got to order food. The food arrived after a reasonable amount of time. I felt like I wanted to pay my bill at that time so we could leave in a timely manner and not be held bill captive.  Service gets 2 stars.   I want this place to survive because it is a local business with great food. Service issue needs to be resolved to reflect the price point of food. There are a million places to go get a $12.00 entree and a $5.00 beer, give me a reason to want to spend my money here.",

Also \"caramelized \" onions were just greasy and fried. Staff okay but when expressed concern about above, they became arguementive. In breif, restaurant has potential but needs improvement. Much better places for mid  to high end burgers in Valley.",

Oh well... we ordered the Caprese Flatbread and two BBQ burgers. The flatbread was a cold piece of focaccia with tasteless tomatoes and some bland mozzarella. Not impressed. The burgers were good, messy but good. I was really disappointed that there were so few choices of burgers at this place. Their truffle fries were very good. The staff...well they didn't seem to care that we were there.  Sadly we won't be back here. They had potential but for the money they won't get a second chance.",

    "text": "AZ Restaurant Week 2013 brought me to Charr - An American Burger for the first time.    Let's just run down the good things about Charr real quick:   About the restaurant itself:  -takes reservations on Open Table.  Sweet.  -had reservations available on time on our arrival.   something to be said as many places don't!  -nice outdoor patio  -good ambiance and decorations  About the food:   -crab cake appetizer was good. flaky, good flavors, good size for sharing (2 on the plate)  -my cousin loved the truffle fries  (she actually took the leftover fries to go she liked them so much) -I had the salmon burger.   The salmon was perfectly cooked.  I decided to forego the bun, it was delicious on its own.  I get that this is a \"burger joint\" so there's a theme, but it's great as a non-burger too (that's how i would order in the future)  -My cousin had the BBQ burger.   MMM!!!  I had a few bites of it.  Now that's a burger!  Get it! -The garlic knot buns are awesome!   -The Moscow Mule was perfect!  Served in a copper mug, minty fresh, all I hoped for!   My only grumble about this place was that the service was pretty slow.  We sat outside and it seemed like our waitress didn't know if we were in her section or not, though she was friendly.  It took about 10 minutes for anyone to greet us after we had been seated  The meal took about 2 hours to finish for the two of us.  Nevertheless, it was enjoyable!!  If you're up for a leisurely meal, definitely hit up Charr's.",

I had a Charr Burger with Cheddar Cheese. It was nicely cooked to medium rare. My girlfriend opted for the Chicken Grill. Both turned out to be good choices. The garlic knot bun for the burger is unique and buttery good. The meat could have used a bit more seasoning, but still had good flavor. The truffle fries were an excellent companion piece to the whole meal.  In the end, our waiter, Gino, was kind enough to give us some extra garlic knot buns to take home. Had a sandwich on one for dinner that night.  The burger world is the crowded spot these days, but Charr does have a home in it.",

I ordered a cocktail off their menu and it was pretty good.   When we sat down for our meal it took some time for our server to get to us. She came to us and asked if we had been helped since we already had drinks. I guess the hostess didn't inform her?  We ordered crab cakes for our appetizer, the portabella burger with truffle fries for me and steak with marsalla sauce with potato cake and asparagus for the boyfriend, and bread pudding with Bourbon blueberries for dinner. This is the reason I'm giving this place 3 stars: service was really slow! Another couple sat next to us after we were seated and they got their food before us. I'm not sure if it was because of the steak we ordered, but it was a long time until we got our main course. The actual food tasted good, but nothing to die for really. Also, their tap water tasted a bit off. Maybe it wasn't filtered? Eek.. Just like this rating, my experience at Charr was A-Ok.",

My son had the Carolina BBQ Burger, fries and a side salad, I had the The Phoenix Burger, onion rings with a wedge salad. The burgers were cooked perfect, their french fries and onion rings are the best I've had in years. It's so nice when the chipotle mayo, ketchup, lettuce (they use butter lettuce, yummy), tomato and onion is service on the side. That may sound crazy to some of you but I love it when the condiments are serviced on the side. Omgosh, we tried the Blueberry Bread Pudding, it was amazing. Our waitress Kristen S was attentive, courteous and best of all she knew the menu.  We will definitely be stopping in again. Thank you for a delicious lunch.",

Only five other people in their, sat at the bar and ordered the spicy margarita, the bartender looked at me confused and said, \"huh?\"  I repeated my order and showed her the menu. The marg came in a pint glass and was a MESS chopped up jalapeno with seeds floating in it. It's a BAR don't they have a shaker/strainer?  I sat for a very long while before I got her attention to order their wings. The bartender made fun of me when I ordered them, she was laughing and mocking me saying \"this girl says she wants some wings\". They came out and were covered in way too much sauce. Half moon has much better wings had more choices of sauce.  I like the concept of this place and the way the bar is back-lit but there are a lot of other choices in the area with much better service and food.",

I ordered more than one light and refreshing sangria's this evening. Sara makes this sacred sangria with her secret ingredient Grand Marnier. This very berry refreshing drink is a great way to enjoy summer dinners.  Course one is mixed baby greens and cold antipasto platters of prosciutto, souprisatta, spek, housemade mozzarella, provolone ,grilled vegetables, roasted peppers, marinated artichokes with a country mix of earthy, delectable olives.  Course two for me was  Linguine Fra Diavolo with shrimp, clams, mussels, calamari hot pepper bite. Fra Divalo translates as \"Brother Devil\", hinting that this dish is a little spicy but it was mild enough.  Out of respect I wanted to thank Joe for the fabulous meal and the wonderful staff because as Don Corleone once said \"Friendship is everything. Friendship is more than talent. It is more than the government. It is almost the equal of family\". -Mario Puzo.",

    "text": "Charr is yet another in a long list of burger restaurants that have sprung up around Phoenix (and across the country). I'm convinced these places justify their high burger prices by adding the descriptor \"gourmet\" to their name, and offering a variety of burger options. Who would have imagined that $10+ for a cheeseburger would be a good deal??  We ordered the American Turkey burger, Charr Burger with cheese, and the kid's meal chicken fingers. We thought the turkey burger was a bit on the dry side. It comes with a garlic aioli, which was flavorful, but there was a lot of it! The cheeseburger was ordered medium, and was more medium-well. It was good, though. The little one loved the chicken fingers and all of us devoured the truffle fries!  Attentive service, nice ambience. Decent food.",

Nearly 10 minutes after we were seated, I try to flag someone down through the front window, and finally our waitress arrived and took our orders. She apologized for the delay, said something about how she had to train someone to enter food orders. It didn't seem exceptionally busy, so I think they just forgot we were seated. I thought this might be an isolated incident, but then I watched another man with a small child get seated near us a half hour later and end up leaving before a waitress ever arrived because the child couldn't wait any longer to eat... I see from the reviews other people have had similar experiences. Maybe the wait staff they're training will improve the service here, but it wasn't great when we went.  The reason I am giving 3 stars is the food. The Carolina burger was delicious... The sauce and bacon were savory, the garlic knot bun was perfect. Their fries were great and they give you plenty of them.  I'd recommend this place for the food, but expect to wait for it.",

You can have fries with white truffle oil or homemade mac-n-cheese. A side salad or sweet potato fries are a buck more, and homemade onion rings are a couple of bucks more, but are yummy. They have two slider options for appetizers where the garlic knot bun's are homemade. The chili wings are tasty. They have great portion salad options in case a burger is not what your wanting. The shakes are a great compliment. They have a few desserts. I had the warmed brownie with vanilla bean ice cream, whipped cream and more chocolate syrup on top. Did I mention they have a full bar, and many craft beers on tap. So many choices I did not list.",

There is nothing good about this place.  We went there for lunch . . . walked in and were told to sit wherever we wanted, and then when we chose a spot out of the wind (all doors were open), we were told that whole area was reserved for large parties.  There was one other couple in the restaurant and two people sitting at the bar.  The waiter was surly, impatient, and uninformed.  When we asked a question about the beers on draft, he snapped that he had no idea because it was 4th day on the job.  There was no manager in sight.  The beer, by the way, was warm.  We ordered and waited forever for the food.  Again, there was only one other table.  The food was definitely not good.  How do you ruin a basic burger?  Put it on a smashed bun with a mealy tomato slice that was sliced 4 days ago and a brown-edged leaf of anything-but-crisp lettuce.  It was awful.  The Buffalo chicken sandwich was even worse.  Even the french fries were terrible . . . they were a mix of crispy ones and pale, cold, floppy ones.  Like they mixed an old batch and a new batch together.  Gross.  We took a couple of bites and asked for the check.  Seriously, this place is bad.  Don't waste your time or money.",

    "text": "Very underwhelming to say the least...  $38 plus tip for 2 burgers 1 glass of house wine 1 draft beer  Burgers were okay but this place is charging Scottsdale prices in north phoenix.  Happy hour only 3-5 pm and I think reverse as well.  No daily specials, nothing exciting, oysters were priced at $3.50/each lol.  Probably one and done here for me as I will gladly enjoy a culvers or paradise valley burger company and go to Scottsdale when I want to pay $13 for a cocktail.  Sorry guys, not worth it.",
