So then I was all \"don't be such a barney\". I'm pretty sure he didn't get the reference but that's okay.   The food was good. Sampler platter, grubalicous. I went with the 2 meat combo and did the bbq pulled pork and beef brisket even though I'm 110% vegan. If leaves tasted that good, then I probably wouldn't have to stray so often. Love their mac 'n cheese too. I would bathe in it if I could.",

I called & ordered the Big Slap which is $25.93 including tax; however, they can't put in the order for the free wings unless I'm there physically to show them the email offer.  So, I came & showed them the email.  Got my order & paid.  But when I checked the wings, there were only 4 wings.  There is no where in the offer to specify only 4 wings.  No point of arguing with False advertisement from this place.   BEWARE of False advertisement.  I was going to return the order but it's not fair to employees.  I will definitely not be ordering any of their promotional offers.",

My daughter and her husband happened upon Famous Dave's.When they got home all they could talk about was how much they loved the place.So, the whole family went and they really understated just how great this place is! The manager came over and asked how was everything and I told him that the staff was shear perfection!The food was the best barbeque we have ever had and the atmosphere of the restaurant was so fun! I love their products so much that I buy the 4 pack Famous Dave's sauces for Christmas gifts. I give gift cards for birthday and anniversary gifts. I hate shopping, so this makes my life so much easier. I believe my family really loves getting these items as gifts, because they ask me to please give them the same gifts again next year. We always end up with to-go containers, because the portions are HUGE! That is why we go for lunch,then we eat the food we brought home for dinner.Oh and I almost forgot to mention the corn muffins, WOW, they are amazing! We go to Famous Dave's approximately 2 times a month and have always been extremely satisfied! When I had my restaurant(I'm a chef )I had difficulty finding servers that met my expectations. Famous Dave's has hit the jackpot with their servers and their kitchen staff! Keep up the great work and we will see you soon.",

Full menu for any appetite-small medium OR large.  Food is consistantly good, and filling as well.  Audrey and I came here for lunch today, and it was delicous as always.  We were seated immediately, and pondered over the menu for a while.  I went with the BBQ Brisket lunch sandwich, and Audrey went with the fish sandwich.  Both dishes were tasty, and extremely filling!  I will say, even though I server was VERY nice and friendly, I was surprised at how slow she was with taking our orders, and our food took a while to come out. No points lost, just a side note.  Will gladly be returning for some of the best BBQ in town! I love ya Daves!",

I buy them in the store as well.  -Decent pricing, especially if you share a feast  Kind of a outdoor picnic feel but don't have to share table with a bunch of other people, it more the traditional waiter type restaurant.",

    "text": "3 1/2 Stars.  Girl's choice last night.... and we (my sister, my niece Carol, and myself) ended up at the Famous Dave's in Chandler. These Famous Dave's look like every other one... typically bright Orange and Yellow! At night, you must have deficient eyesight if you can't find a Famous Dave's! In the evening, Famous Dave's is just a lighthouse beacon in the middle of a drab mall!  On the menu...  Blue Margarita (** 1/2) made with Blue Curacao - It's disconcerting when the last time you saw your niece she was just drinking Cokes... now it's Blue Margaritas. Must be getting old. In summary... not very toxic. Could have drank this in one gulp and wouldn't have had an effect! Machine mixed and made. Looked cool, though, with an Aquamarine Blue color.  All American BBQ Feast (****) Gimmick is that all this stuff ( Full Slab of St Louis style SpareRibs (*****), Whole BBQ Chicken (*** 1/2), 1/2 lb of Texas Beef Brisket (*****), Famous Fries (*****), 2 Baked Potatoes with all the Fixin's (*****) replaced the Coleslaw and Wilbur Beans, 4 Corn on the Cob (***), 4 Muffin Style Corn Bread (****) ) is served on a bright, shiny, galvanized Garbage Can lid. Some of the items definitely lacking in BBQ flavor.  Hot Fudge Kahlua Brownie (**) Warm, Walnut covered Chocolate Brownie, soaked with Kahlua Liquer and topped with Vanilla Bean Ice Cream, Hot Fudge, and (loads and loads of) Whipped Cream. Ice Cream and Kahlua was no-where to be found!  Total tab: $82.08. Not bad for the amount of food.  Service (****) This is a total generalization... but what the heck! The wait-staff at Famous Dave's is totally opposite from the previous evening's robotic lifeless performance from the wait-staff at Olive Garden ( <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/olive-garden-italian-restaurant-chandler#hrid:l6HajH2UNtb1EZMTj19Ccg\">yelp.com/biz/olive-garde...</a>  ). I really don't give a darn if it's just a performance... the attitude that the wait-staff presents will be passed onto the customers... whether bad or good.  Typical of all Famous Dave's you sit at a booth or table covered with Red and White checkered table-cloths. At the front entrance is a display of all the BBQ awards that Famous Dave's BBQ items have won.... mostly in the MidWest. Check out the lead-pipe utilitarian interior design... Cool!  Very colorful and festive atmosphere! Kids or adults with a kid's attitude will love Famous Dave's.",

I've been told that Dave is a Chippewa Indian...may sound a little odd...but he cooks up some very good barbeque!  Three restaurants have opened in Arizona in the past year or so.  Famous Dave's was a staple of my diet back when I was sufferin' in Minne-snow-ta. The chicken is OK, pulled pork and beef brisket better. But what pulled me in were their St. Louis style ribs. Baby backs are good, but I just kind of dig spare ribs more. Don't know why...I just do. Famous Dave's does a pretty fair job with theirs.  Nice and meaty,  and grilled so that there's a little char on them. The meat falls off the bone just like it should. If I have any complaint with them it's that they slather it with their regular sauce. I really like their Texas Pit better.   So if you're in the area, give them a try. Starting to get a little corporate, but don't let that stop you.  It's good solid \"Q\" that rivals most in the Valley.   P.S. Skip the frozen corn as a side...ask for extra beans! :)",

It was against my better judgement to visit this place and even consider eating here as I don't enjoy the taste at all...but, having said that - I was coerced into joining for lunch - so off I went.  First of all, I was very impressed with how extensive the menu was.  It had everything from citrus-y grilled salmon, to burgers and of course BBQ.  I had the iced tea along with the extremely hot boneless wings (Wilbur's Revenge).  I have to admit the chicken was very spicy (I could definitely handle hotter) - but I was impressed.  I had their fries, mac 'n' cheese and corn.  The food was very fresh and tasty.  The other party had the lemon roasted chicken - wow!  Very fresh and with the Wilbur's Revenge sauce and a little tabasco to kick it up, the meal was much more enjoyable than I had ever expected it to be.  I will be back to try the bleu cheese burger, the cod sandwich, and the...sweet tea, and the list goes on!",

Everyone was able to find something they found interesting. Famous Dave's, especially for a large chain, is always solid.  The baby backs were a little scrawny but well smoked.  The brisket was similarly cut from a slab a bit smaller than I would use to smoke myself, but again tender and flavorful.  Even the smoked chicken salad and cedar plank salmon was well done. True there is better BBQ in town (Bootleggers, Black Mountain), but Famous Dave's may be the best large BBQ chain in the country. Well worth it.",

It was crowded around 1ish when we were here, but there was plenty of seating outside, and it was a nice day, so we ate on the patio.  They have some good, reasonably priced lunch specials.  My husband had the pulled pork sandwich ($6.99) which included one side and a cornbread muffin.  I opted for the one-meat platter ($7.99) which also includes one side and cornbread.  For those that are really hungry, you can upgrade to a 2 meat platter for a dollar more.    There are various platter meats to choose from, including pulled pork, brisket, chicken, and a beer-battered cod.  I opted for the cod, which had a very crispy, crunchy crust.  The cod, however, was just a step up from the Gorton's Fisherman.  It was a little tough and dry.  I tried the pulled pork sandwich, which had a hearty amount of meat on plain hamburger bun.  The meat itself was tender, and had a good amount of smokey flavor, but for me, there was a little bit of a weird aftertaste with the meat at the end.    For sides, there are a multitude to choose from, including fries, mashed potatoes, baked beans, and green beans.  I tried the mashed potatoes, which had a strong garlic flavor, and had a light, whipped texture.  Service was friendly, and drinks were refilled promptly as needed.  Overall, a decent price for decent food for lunch.",

I ordered a pulled BBQ chicken sandwich with pepperjack cheese off the lunch menu, delicious and a great price! I like my things spicy so mixing Devil's Spit and Texas Pit definitely gave me the kick I was looking for. Plus the little chips are good too!",

    "text": "I've been eating lunch at this location for 6 years.  In the last 2 months I've noticed a sudden \"portion control\" infesting the business.  Today the double meat platter had a dollop of Georgia pulled pork.  3 bites worth tops before it was gone.  This is maybe 1/8 the size it has been for decades.  2 months ago it was noticeably half sized from normal, but now it's ridiculous.  I'm not sure if there is a new manager who is trying to win brownie points with corporate by shortchanging the portions they give the paying customers, but his short sighted thinking will result in the closing of this location in the long run (probably 2018 at this rate).  The bartender, manager, and cook all seemed to be sniping at one another over everything from placement of a bar mat to what channel the tv should be on.  Each were complaining to the other that people were sitting on the patio (gee, it's finally under 90 in Phoenix for the first time in 8 months.  And, if you don't want people on your patio... DON'T HAVE A PATIO!)  I ate here once a week for years but today was the end.  RIP Dave's.  Wish I could say I'll be sad when this location closes but, you brought it upon yourselves.",

    "text": "Went here for lunch on a week day with my co-workers for a team lunch. I was really looking forward to this places and I love BBQ. When I first walk in you can really tell its a BBQ restaurant. Very county looking with cartoon pigs. Seems very inviting.   They start you off with a bowl of bbq chips. Seemed like these were homemade cause each one was different shapes and sizes. Pretty good I must say.   I had the lunch special brisket sandwich with a side of Mac and Cheese. They pile on a good portion of brisket and looked really good. They have so many different BBQ sauces at the table. I tried the Sweet & something (forgot the name) sauce. So I dumped a lot of sauce on it. Wasn't sure why but then realized the brisket looked a little too dry. I thought the brisket sandwich was okay. Not great. Could have been better  but good. The Mac & Cheese was okay. It had Jalapenos and corn in it. Nice little kick but not a lot of taste. Little disappointed cause I was expecting a little more from a bbq place.   The service was really good. Welcomed us quickly and got our drinks out fairly quickly. We got our food pretty quickly for being a big party. They also cleaned off our dirty plates in a timely manner. So service was friendly and efficient.   So overall, I thought the food was okay. I've tasted better. I thought Rudy's brisket is moister but I did like the choices of BBQ sauces. Loved their service. So if I had a craving for bbq would I come back. Maybe. It wouldn't be a bad choice but I would probably pick Rudy's over Dave's. Just a personal taste. Personal choice. If you do come here. Enjoy.",

Took forever to get us seated, we saw a couple parties come in after us get seats before us when we looked annoyed they finally sat us. We had to wait a while and finally we had to let them know we're ready for to order. And as we waited we were the ones to ask for the chips appetizer. So we noticed everyone was getting food before us who came after us. We asked about why we had to wait so long because it's unusual we wait that long and the waiter didn't answer us he just said ok and walked away and called the GM who then just said well burgers take a while and he will look at the videos to see what time we ordered. We're not picky people but was just annoyed with the wait time to sit, to be asked to ordered and then for our food. It's not fun watching everyone who came in after you get food before you.",

    "text": "So i usually Love Famous Daves, but tonight they really dropped the ball. I was there with a somewhat large group so I expected there to be some confusion. But we waited almost 40 minutes before the first plates came out, and once they did at least half of our food was incorrect as well as cold! I ended up sending mine back and I will say that it did come back piping hot. My issue is with the fact that we kept getting told that it was super slammed in the kitchen, but yet our meals come out cold. Which tells me they sat for a while in the back. My second issue is that we asked for a manger and he peeked out and went back inside when he saw that some of the plates had been delivered (maybe he. Got called away before coming out, but that's definitely what it looked like). He eventually came out and delivered my second order of food and then left again. He never came out to check once we all had our meals to see how everything was. If you're not going to offer any type of apology at least offer some type of dessert or discount on the meal. But no one really said anything. Our server was apologetic, but a manager really should have gotten involved after we had so many issues with the food. Super disappointed with our experience.",

    "text": "It's disappointing when you mess up barbecue. I really look forward to the fall off the bone tenderness of some good smoked ribs. This used to be my go to spot for several reasons but I'm crossing this off my list. The ribs here have gotten really bad. I ordered the big slab with an extra side of ribs and the ribs were super fatty and the quality of meat was terrible. The last time I checked ribs had a bone in the middle and they were supposed to fall off the bone. These ribs were nothing but fat and mushy.  I had to literally tear apart the meat to tear away at all the fat on the bone. The meal came with 2 sides and cornbread muffin. I got the baked beans and potato wedge fries. The baked beans were really good. Have a little spice with bits of meat. The wedge fries were fresh, big and full of potato. The muffin...not so much. It was hard and tasted like it was cooked 3 days ago. Muffins should be moist and tear apart so butter and honey can be smeared on it. I could have thrown this muffin at the a glass window and it would have shattered to pieces.   I could have caught them on a bad night but I want some consistency. This is how you lose business. Quality is important. Don't cheap it out to save a couple bucks. You are better than this Dave! Please fix this.",

Our appetizers were the Nachos & Onion Strings. And for the main course - We ordered the dinner for two. It had chicken, cole slaw, spare ribs, beans, corn bread, sauce and fries.  The waitress gave us chips to munch on while waiting for our appetizers. It was good! The apps came 15 mins later (which we got full) because our main course meal came in 40 mins later. Everything was good, but waiting and getting full because of the apps, we could have gotten our food and not waiting on it. It was not that busy.  But the waitress gave me a refill of Dr. Pepper without me asking and she was really helpful coming back to ask how we were doing.  We had dessert, the brownie! It was a big portion, so shareable (if you'd share because my sisters didn't want to share lol). It was ok not that sweet (I like it sweet though).",

Decent presentation and sides were \"okay\" but the star was the fish. The way it was prepared was perfect. Light batter, lightly salted, flaky, great taste and texture. MMMmmm just thinking about it makes me hungry ;) They do have vegetable options such as corn, broccoli, salad and beans so that's what we got with it and I'd call it a success. Price was VERY reasonable at about $12 so if you are a catfish fan, you must try. They also have strips as an app as well as the filet.",

We ordered the brisket with Mac Ron cheese and sweet corns, rib tips with mash potato and pineapple.  The portion was quite generous ,  n they offered a muffin for each meal. Both the brisket n ribs were quite flavorful especially the ribs, grilling with several spices.  However, I wish both can be tenderer, it was a bit dry for now, hard to chew, not as juicy n tender as what Rudy's bbq.",

Extremely dry and very tough. You can tell they cook these ribs over direct heat as the bones were chard as well as some of the crust. Full disclosure: I've been smoking meats for years so I know what good Q looks like.  Maybe they're famous for the sauce because I have to say it was pretty good however when ribs come out with sauce on it that is an indication to me that it's going downhill from there. I'll stop back by and give these guys one more shot and I'll try something else on the menu and update my post at that time.",

Exception at Famous Dave's is that they want to sit you down, over-charge you for meat and sides that are pre-made and try and up charge you with drinks so you have to pay more on tip.  Our server was nice enough and we ordered two meat with two sides each for me and my gf. It took 5 minutes for them to get the food out. You know what that tells me? Yeah we shouldn't have to sit down and the server come take our order. The only reason they don't go the traditional route is to charge us extra since 'sit-down dining experience' people expect to pay more. THATS IT.  The meat was good I guess, I had the bbq chicken and pulled pork. The sides were atrocious, mac-n-cheese I can just taste the pre-madeness with injected cheese flavoring, cole slaw was runny. In the end we paid $40 plus tip to $46.  Only come here if you want to pay extra to sit down and have someone bring the food to you.",

    "text": "I went in about 9:30 after babysitting my grandchildren for the evening so I could take advantage of their happy hour prices. I knew I wanted the catfish strips which come to $5 at happy hour price. You can't go wrong with that! I decided to get a Lifted Kilt beer, my new guilty pleasure, and got four ribs knowing I would probably end up taking half my dinner home to make another meal. The ribs are only $1 apiece so it's easy to splurge.  The Lifted Kilt beer was only $2 for the 14 ounce size. They have a 22 ounce size for only $3 at happy hour but I figured if I got that I wouldn't be able to even drive home.   Everything was delicious and the service was good, at least until the end. The only seats inside the bar area where tall stools which I don't do well on since I'm short. The weather was pleasant so I sat outside but I was the only one out there. They guy checked up on me adequately but when he brought my bill toward the end he almost ran away from me before I could ask for a to-go box. Then he never came back to collect my credit card payment.  After waiting about 10 minutes or more for him to return I gathered up my leftovers and bill and went to the hostess stand and told the hostess I wanted to leave but my waiter never came back for my payment. There was no one at the stand when I first walked up. I probably could have walked right out and they would have assumed I paid but I wouldn't do that to somebody, not my style. The hostess was very pleasant and instead of asking me to wait for my server which I was afraid she would do, she just took the bill and credit card and came back quickly with the copy for me to sign and one to keep. I signed it and set the folder on her stand and left. I didn't doc the tip much, just rounded it down instead of up like I usually do. He was a fine server until the end. I think he just forgot about me since I was the only one out there. Either that or else he found a cute girl to flirt with and THEN forgot about me. Who knows?",

Cole slaw. Potatoes, corn on the Cobb and cornbread.   Meats and cornbread were perfect.   Sides - Cole slaw, BBQ beans. Green beans, mashed potatoes, mac n cheese - were just OK.  Lots of potatoes which we really didn't eat cause they were just bland, flavorless, and dry.  Wait.  The corn and cornbread were awesome.  Especially the cornbread.    KIds had a few things, hot link (wasn't hot) more like mild link, and catfish fingers.  Not bad.  But nothing to race about.    Why the 3 stars you say?   Welllllllllllllllll......  It was happy hour.  And guess what? Can't have happy hour menu or pricing at the table.  Only at the bar.  Mid you the place is 3/4 empty on a Friday afternoon.    So you can go to the bar and bring it back to your table.  Why does that not make any sense to me whatsoever?   So I ask our hostess what their happy hour consisted of, says \"I don't know\", asked her for a happy hour menu.  She states I will find one and never returns.    I ask our waiter if he has a happy hour menu or knows what happy hour consists of, guess what he says?  \"I don't know\".  Almost like they don't want me to drink liquor!!! At a restaurant.  And we all know most restaurants usually want to push drinks down your throats all night long.    So, I go to the bar happy hour beer $3 and $4, tall glass 22 oz $4 domestics $5 imports. Not bad.  $3 we'll drinks. I ask the bartender (that looks like a young slimmer Tracy Morgan) what can he mix.  He says, \"Basically rum, vodka, tequila, with soda and stuff as long as it ain't no juice\".   I was like, hmmm... no actual pre set menu or any attempt to entice anyone with actual happy hour drinks.  I pretty much have up and had a couple of blue moons and called it a night...   To summarize.  BBQ and cornbread 5 stars.  Sides 3 stars. Service and knowledge of the place you work at, 3 stars, happy hour/bar 3 stars....   Over all not bad.... could be better.",

    "text": "My friend and I had a lunchtime craving for some brisket. We both had the one meat platter and chose the Texas brisket. I had the side of garlic mashed potatoes and my friend had the potato salad. The cornbread muffin that accompanied the platter was moist and tasty. The one meat platter was $8.97. The meat was tender and needed very little bbq sauce (you have your choice of 5 different types of sauces). I especially liked the red skinned mashed potatoes. Real bits of mild garlic gave them a pleasing punch.  Our server was super nice. The place looked clean. There are both table and chairs and booths for seating. We got a sandwich to-go for my friend's husband and it arrived freshly prepared as we payed the bill. Parking is close to the door.  Yeh, it is a chain, but Famous Dave's does it well. The bonus is that it is a sit down place. For my mobility impaired friend this is the way to go over cafeteria style serving lines found in many bbq restaurants.",

But the last time we came here, we stood at the hostess stand for 5 mins without being acknowledged, no \"hello, be with you in a minute\", no eye contact, nothing. When the hostess could finally be bothered to look at us she said the wait was 50 minutes. Normally waits are a bummer, but what can you do right? But the way she said this was so unwelcoming, didn't offer to take our names. We obviously left, and won't be back.",

I'll write about what we got today.  The Kraft Mac & Cheese kid's meal with fries and lemonade fit a kid's tastes and was priced reasonably.  The Rib Tips were outstanding and a generous quantity was served. The dry rub was so good I was in serious conflict over whether to dip them in any sauce.  Of course, that's a dilemma too, because all 5 sauces are very good.  The sides were done well: creamy fresh coleslaw with a bit of zing, nice BBQ beans, warm cornbread muffin and BBQ potato chips. Lemonade was icy cold.  Host was very nice and the server efficient.  Nice job!!",

My sister and I lived out of state, but started coming here when visiting our parents and we first encountered Erica - personable, great sense of humor, attentive without being intrusive, excellent menu knowledge and recommendations. What more could you want?  That first visit was years ago. Our parents have passed, but I still find myself in Chandler (usually) twice a year, and it's not a proper visit if my sister and I don't go to \"Dave's\" to \"have lunch\" with Erica.  The food's great (oh, save room to share a bread pudding!) ... but when Erica's there it's even better!",

And so glad I did!!!!  It's a chain but who cares!  Service was great and we hit it at a good time when it wasn't crowded.  Got a lemonade in a huge mason jar and it was made in house; you could tell by the taste.  No powder mix here!  The names of their sauces are a bit funny such as Devil's Spit but when our server came to explain the sauces I was entertained.  She takes a plate and writes the first letter of each sauce on it explaining what they may tastes like and then gives up a small bowl of the best bbq potato chips I've had in awhile to use to dip the sauces.  Didn't do that, ended up eating the chips as is and just tapping my finger into the sauces and tasting to see how they tasted.  Hubs had a rack of baby back Memphis style ribs that were so good a couple of his bones walked away from his plate (whistles innocently) along with two sides and a cornbread muffin for $24.00.  I had a plate of rib tips which were good but as I remember them being - more fat and gristle than meat sometimes - along with my two sides.  The pickles weren't really my thing but those pickled onions? Yes!  Our bill came up to the mid to upper 40's but I wasn't complaining. My only complaint is that we didn't find this place earlier!",

Most of the tables were seated by family members or birthday parites...they're really accommodating to large parties.   Their menu consists of a variety of BBQ (feasting) options. If you're vegetarian, I would suggest going somewhere else. Being as though they like to advertise the numerous awards they've received on their bbq's, I'd doubt you guys would even bother to come anyhow.   I ordered the chicken wings off the appetizer because I wasn't too hungry. Got the mild spiciness level and it was perfect. The meat fell right off the bone and 8 pieces actually ended up being a little too much (shared them with others at the table).  You can see pictures of what was devoured at our table. Nobody raved about how good their meal was, but definitely were more than full by the time we got up. Two people ordered the full stack of pork ribs though and they seemed to thoroughly enjoy it..don't know how they finished it...it's crazy big and comes with 2? 3 sides??   mac and cheese side comes with jalapenos and corn mixed in them. yummm and the mashed potato was good too.   Service was okay, could've seen our waiter more but others working at the restaurant roam around to check up on how you're meal is going..even their mascot (fat pink pig)   Only thing I must note: IceT the rapper and actor (Law and Order: SVU) was spotted dining with family as we were finishing up! omg it made me so happpy. I was staring at him smiling while he was walking from the restroom to his table...i swear he saw me and snuck a wave. Would've asked for a picture but didn't want to bother his precious time with family/friends.   Big lot for parking, right by the Harkins Theater at Chandler mall.",

There was no wait when we came in, but it was about 4 pm.  Big steak fries, coleslaw, corn on the cob and corn biscuit are all good side selections.

I have no idea if there is new staff or they are cutting cost buying cheaper meat or what, but you can tell, last night we bought the all american feast for our family and the ribs were just weird tasting, the brisket dry and the wings overcooked. This is the second time we get dry brisket. For the $$$ we spent, I wish it would have been a better dinner.",

Famous Dave's is one of three different chains which I rate quite highly around here. Great meat, great sauces, and great sides. So what's the difference? Famous Dave's is more of a sit-down place than most of the other options, which offer more of a cafeteria-style situation. This has its benefits, as the service is good, and the atmosphere is a step up, but you'll pay slightly more than you might at Rudy's or another BBQ joint. Still - 4 stars, and this is a great place to come for lunch specials.",

They just began this happy hour thing last month and it's been well worth the wait.  $2 drafts, $3 huge drafts, $3 wells & 1-4 Dollar appetizers.  They always feature the current Sam Adams seasonal & JIMMY BUFFET'S Land Shark Lager so there is always somthing nice to quench yoour thirst.   The greatest feature of all?   These specials can only be had at the bar, so NO SCREAMING CHILDERN to deal with!!! YAY!!!   REALLY!  Dosen't it just suck that parents think it's ok to subject other people to their poorly raised howling children? Won't have that problem doing happy hour here!!! YAY AGAIN!!! I'm a fan!!!",

Not a big deal of course, since we were going to have a margarita anyway. Once I arrived, the host working was really helpful in helping me find my friend and he was extremely friendly. We were sitting in the bar area, with Jenn, I think her name was, as our server. My friend and I both have worked at restaurants before so we understand how it goes. However, our server was horrible. She made us feel like we had to rush in making an order by attempting to grab all the menus once we ordered our beverage. Once we did figure out our order, she did not give us time to tell her we wanted substitutions. She just took the order and left. The food was alright, nothing special in my opinion, but our server seemed like we were a burden to her day. It was not busy in the bar area when we were there, and she was more focused on her patio tables rather than her whole section. She took forever to realize that we were done eating and that we needed our check. Once we paid, we realized the amount we were charged and the amount on the original receipt were different amounts. She wasn't around for us to ask her what that was about, and I didn't have any more time to sit around and wait for her to come back. This was my first time coming to this establishment and I'm not going back just because of this experience",

    "text": "I have eaten here with my family more than a handful of times.  We are repeat customers mainly for the food.  When we come in a big group, a couple of \"All American Feasts\" usually does the trick.  They have an excellent  menu.  I usually order the Rib Tips or the BBQ Buddies, which is a plate that consists of four different BBQ sliders.    I don't usually like coleslaw, but theirs is exceptional.  In fact, all of their sides are pretty damn good.  My favorite is the potato salad.  Sometimes, all my younger daughter wants to eat is Mac & Cheese, and thankfully, they have that on the kids menu.    The different sauces brings your meal full circle.  I love having options like that.  Each one is delicious, but I'm especially drawn to the \"Texas Pit\" and \"Devil's Spit\" sauces.  A couple of years ago, there was a waitress there that we would almost always get, and it was pretty much guaranteed that she would bring us the wrong side dishes.  It was pretty cool, since she would bring us the correct sides and not take back the incorrect order.  I miss those days.  I really like that they have a hand-washing station right in the dining area.  It's only right that an eatery of this style provides such a convenient option.  The only reason I held back on giving this restaurant that one remaining star is because I'm a big fan of sweet tea, and I have noticed that theirs is pretty hit or miss.  If that was more consistent, I'd be inclined to giving them a perfect score.",

BUT, I ordered Wings, which were  great, but the celery and carrot slices weren't the best. Especially the carrots sticks. They were from old and big carrots and tasted stale as well as being hard to chew. Am hoping that next time they will use newer carrots. The bread pudding I had, am definitely going back to have again. It was the best bread pudding I have ever had, and I am 80 years old, and bread pudding is one of my favorites. Thank you Famous Dave's. Ann",

My husband and I were greeted and given menus. Jim, our waiter came and asked if this was our first time and yes it was. He was enthusiastic to show us all sorts of different sauces they have for us to try. There was a lunch special where you choose 2 meat and 1 side for just  $9.99. How can you beat that? My husband tried their St. Louie ribs and cod. I tried their roasted chicken and beef brisket. I would say I like all of the meat besides beef brisket. Their famous fries were ok (not fried enough for me).   Overall I really liked the environment and the cheap meals! Definitely worth a try.",

The Texas brisket plate comes with sliced brisket atop a slice of white bread, 2 sides of your choosing, and a corn muffin which I am not fond of.  zTejas makes my favorite corn bread, served in a skillet with sweet butter.  The sides I like are cob corn and grilled pineapple steaks.  The broccoli is pretty good too, as is the wilbur beans, which have scraps of brisket in them (not vegetarian)  I've tried one of the desserts, their Dave's Famous Bread Pudding, and it is spectacular, with a praline sauce pecans beg to float in, golden raisins, an oversized mound of sweet whipped cream and a large scoop of vanilla ice cream.  If you want to get this $6.49 dessert for free, simply take the survey on your receipt, write down the code, and bring it back with you on your return visit.",

Was there about 6 weeks ago and they were promoting a new pork burnt end sandwich & it was great however next time (2 weeks later) it was not very good didn't taste anything like the time before. Not long ago I also tried their shrimp Po boy sandwich it was served on an 8\" hoagie pilled high with full size shrimp, lots of fries & it was very good & more than I could eat. Today I ordered the shrimp Po boy & it was served on some tiny 4\" toasted bread with these tiny half cooked shrimp & I got very few fries. Our server did tell us that as of 7/1 they are under new management & he was learning a new system & did apologize for not serving us their potato chips since the new system didn't order them. So what's going on & what's up with this new inconsistency?",

The brisket and rib tips were soooo dry and lacking flavor and everything BBQ should be. I should have just gone out and gotten a bag of beef jerky. The green beans were super dead and soggy and there wasn't even a hint of spice like it's suppose to have. The beans and coleslaw were ok, but how can you really mess those up? When we went to pick up our food, they said there was curbside pickup and to pull up and they'll see us through the camera and bring the food right out. We pulled up and waited a good 10 minutes before going into the restaurant and trying to figure out where to pick up our food. We probably will not be back.",

Ribs were tender and savory. but the portion size and their service, they definitely have room to improve.",

We have tried the location 202 and Dobson and we were pleased with our experience there so I was pretty excited to try this place again.  If you look at my old reviews, I wrote one for the other location.  Anyways... I was blown away by the Texas Beef Brisket from the other location and I readily ordered it for dinner... But boy did I get an almost rude awakening.  I received a huge portion of meat which is good but oh man, the meat was dry :( it made me so sad... The one i had before was so tender that it melted in my mouth and made me sad to finish eating it... But at this location... I didn't even eathalf of it... Sad sad sad  The flavor was good butits really just the meat texture that was unsatisfactory... I wonder if its the location? Do they make their meat differently? Or wasit a fluke that we got dry pieces? My manand my sister both got the same thing from our previousexperience but were also both disappointed... Or was it fluke that we got a mouth watering dish at the other location... The world will never know...  Jk! I wanna go back to the Dobson one and give it another try... It was just too good  On the brightside, service was good. Garlic mashed potatoes are delish the coleslaw was also good. My parents split the Feast for One and it was more than enough!",

My wife had the two meat with ribs & pulled pork. fries and cole slaw. The surprise was an ice cream plate w/sparkler as it was my birthday. The decor is country/western farm rustic.

    "text": "My Redneck radar went off when I entered Daves'. They were selling camouflage shirts with US flags on it saying \"Support the Troops.\" There were U.S. Flags everywhere but not in that patriotic sense but sorta in that obnoxious \"We want to remind you we love America more than you\" sense. Our waiter even said \"ya'll\" and sounded like he was from Texas. I was dying for an NRA card just to protect myself. Our waiter even knew we had never dined there before because when we looked accross the room, the entire restaurant was White and very \"Apache Junction\" if you know what I mean.  I had every reason to hate this place and I ended up debating whether I should give this place 5 stars. The food was great. I had the St. Louis pork ribs. It was 12.99 and came with two sides and I was stuffed when I left. I can't believe they had combos that had even more food than that.  Although our waiter was a good ole boy, he was polite, efficient and considerate. He also took his time to explain the menu and didn't give us the idea that he wanted to buzz off right away.  The only bad thing was he was also a bit salesy and tried to push selling their sauces but all the waiters are asked to do that there. Nonetheless, the service was an A+ and very non-Phoenix. Yes, this person was a middle aged person that didn't act like he was going to be a model or actress and act like he was too good for his job.  The food was really good but it was missing something. The waiter bragged that their St Louis ribs were huge and had a lot of meat on them but honestly, they were of average size. I can't imagine how small their spare ribs might have been then because the St. Louis ribs were \"much bigger\" ,  While I enjoyed their sauce, the meat was rather tasteless. No, the meat did not taste bad or anything but there was no flavor like you find at Honey Bears or the famous BBQ places in the country. Their sides were good but nothing special. The Cole Slaw tasted no different than Cole Slaw at KFC, honestly the Cole Slaw at Long John Silvers tastes better than here. The mac n cheese similarly was good but not uniqe. Their french fries were disappointing and tiny little potatoe wedges.  Their cornbread was really good and the only side dish that really set them apart.  I would recommend this place because there are many positives. The food came out quickly. The service was seriously perfect, you never had to worry where your waiter disappeared to because he would come by at least 3 times to make sure you were okay.  The food was extremely priced well. I paid $30 for a feast. $12.99 for a rib dinner is a steal.  Seriously, you can't even go to McDonalds and order that much food for $12.99.  And yes, I even liked the Redneck charm. It's a fun experience and you forget you are near the west coast and instead feel like you are in Texas or Mesa...take your pick.   Nonetheless, don't expect the BBQ to blow your mind. It's truly very good BBQ and better than El Paso for sure but I would still say Honey Bears is better.  But overall, I think if you go here, you will leave happy and ultimately that's what is important.",

    "text": "It needs to be said that the area around Chandler Fashion Center is in dire need of a good locally owned joint.  However, left with no other choices yesterday, Famous Dave's knocked me off that soapbox for a couple hours.  All the chain components were there - building that looks like the Beverly Hillbillies' cabin, honkey-tonk music playing over the muzak, so much crap on the walls you could hardly see wall, cute pig sayings on staff t-shirts, merchandise table in front...you know the drill.  But the stuff on the walls was genuinely funny (my favorite being the neon pig with the letters M-E-A-T in neon underneath where the M would flash on and off so it would say EAT MEAT).  All the staff were both friendly and knew what they were doing - management clearly must not allow airheads.  Our server helped us through all the special deals they had going on, like the $5 frozen Jose Cuervo margarita and $1/$2/$3/$4 happy hour food (not on their website, but hh is 3-7).  Food came quick and was really, really good.  BBQ experts would probably call their BBQ \"pedestrian\"  (use of that word is a sure way to id a food snob BTW), but I had fun trying the 6 different sauces they had on the table for us (one is called Devil Spit - ha!).  It was a fun place that fed us tasty, fun tood, and we had fun interacting with their staff.  What more could you ask for?  Well...I was in pain the rest of the day, so would ideally like to see more gut-friendly options, but for heaven's sake it's a BBQ joint so I can deal with it once in a while.",

Also they have those stupid food baskets with the raised bottom so the basket you get looks like it's overflowing and then when you eat the food so see it was an illusion.

    "text": "By far one of my favorite BBQ joints in AZ! I love me some BBQ but am also all about the sides. If I go to a BBQ place that has terrible sides, no matter how good the meat is, I most likely will not return. The meat and sides both need to be phenomenal for me to be satisfied! Famous Dave's gets it right with both! Ive gotten several meats from here (I go here a lot) and all have been great. These include the Georgia Chopped Pork, the brisket, the country roasted chicken (I think this is actually my favorite), and I definitely cannot forget about the sweet water catfish with remoulade and sweet chili sauce (Comes in second). Ive also tried a number of the sides and they are all awesome: mac and cheese is by far my favorite cause its creamy and has sweet corn and jalapenos in it. So different but some of the best mac I have ever had! Their potato salad also rocks. Its not sweet potato salad but its flavor is out of this world! Also great are the Wilbur beans and the firecracker green beans with bacon! YES BACON!. About the only side I am not fond of is their fries. I find these little steak fries to be mediocre at best. Additionally, most of the meals are served with a corn muffin which is sooooo good. Make sure you ask for honey with this. So yeah, this place makes me pretty happy each time I go here. One of the best things about it is the price. You can get a 2 meat combo with two sides, corn muffin, and corn on the cob for 13.99! That's AWESOME! Now on to a couple of things that could be better. They are not always consistent with their meat. The hub has stated that their Brisket is very inconsistent and sometimes is out of this world and other times a little dry. Same with the chopped pork. Also, sometimes the service is extremely slow and not very friendly. Lastly, the desserts could be better. Being a total bread pudding connoisseur, I order it wherever I go that they have it if I have room. Got it here once and was not impressed. It tasted more like cake and the maple sauce on it just wasn't my thing. If you want great bread pudding, hit up Charlestons. Also, I think Famous Daves uses the same cake in all their non chocolate desserts. Last night when I ordered the mini strawberry shortcake, it looked the same as the bread pudding but with a strawberry sauce instead of the maple sauce. Bread pudding is not cake so it should not be made with cake! Also, strawberry shortcake should have several strawberries in it rather then just a little slice with a thin runny strawberry sauce. But to each his own, this is just my opinion and some people might love their desserts. I will admit that their chocolate brownie sundae is pretty dam tasty. Anyways, if you are looking for great BBQ and sides at a great price, this is your place!",

I love Famous Dave's, we try to come here at least weekly for lunch. friendly staff, reasonably quick service, and the meat just melts in your mouth. They have a good selection of their own sauces (5 or 6), from sweet n' sassy to 'devil spit', tasty fries, and awesome cornbread muffins.  Try the rib combo platter with some brisket, or the Texas Manhandler Sandwich (Memphis Style).   Can get a little crowded at lunch, especially on Fridays.  Join the PIG (Pretty Important Guest) club for special offers & free Lil' Wilbur meals for kids on their birthday.  You won't be disappointed.",

I got the Catfish Fingers: a basket of tasty, cornmeal-breaded fried catfish. It was a delicious choice; and at half off I think I'll have to come back and get them again. They also have BBQ Pork sliders or side order of fries for $1. Really good deals.",

I'm not personally into receiving my barbecue drowning in sauce, I don't mind a little added at the end, but I like to taste what the original meat tasted like. I was impressed by how tender the meat was until I realized it had probably been tenderized with a sodium solution. the servings are huge, the sides are OK.  Really, Famous Dave's was OK. With other barbecue choices in the valley being superior, I'd pass on the chain and go looking authentic.",

The drink wasn't included, but I ordered iced tea and it tasted like tea--not watered down weak.  The ribs were great, though I forgot to add sauce.  I ordered the green beans and Wilber? Beans, but you also get cornbread muffins and a small ear of corn!  I needed a take out container of course.  The sides were even tasty.    We weren't jumping up and down over our server as he didn't refill our drinks until we were leaving, then he asked, and forgot until he looked while walking past.  It's ok, not a biggie to me but I think the tip wasn't as good as it could've been (not my doing).  I felt bad about that.  Maybe he's new to waiting tables -- I do not hold that against him.

I stupidly did this, and less than an hour after leaving the restaurant I received my first robo call, and I have received numerous calls a day since then.  This is very disruptive to me because I work from home and need to use my phone.  I'm actually considering changing my number because of this.  I can't imagine I'm the only one this has happened to but please be aware of this issue and I would hope that after management reads this review they take a deep dive into who is managing their promotional service and where their customers information is actually going to.

Some people like dry rub some people like it wet some people like only certain cuts,  some people like smoked... etc. Famous Dave's is a chain restaurant that does a pretty good job but it's not always consistent. The available sauce are 'ok' but if you like the sauces then putting it with your food will then compliment it.   One of the things I did enjoy is their lunch specials.  In particular you can get one or two meat items along with the side for a reasonable amount of money & the food comes out pretty quick.   Quick was the main reason that brought me in today for lunch and everything I described was exactly as expected. I wanted some baby back ribs but those were not part of the lunch special so instead I went for the brisket and tried something new with the catfish fingers which are lightly fried with some dipping sauce. The brisket was good soft & tender (I had some chunks of fat that could of been removed prior to serving) & The cat fish fingers had some flavor. I'm not a big fan of the barbecue sauces but you kind of make them work depending on your mood.  I decided to sit in the bar area and watch a little bit of the Masters tournament and the service was great. Would definitely come back for lunch as I like the service, speed, & price... but looking for more consistency.",

Sitting at the bar was fun because it has an open feeling to it plus there are large (70 inch?) monitors to watch the game on. We got some bbq chips while waiting for dinner; the chips are pretty solid and I found them hard to put down. I got the manhandler sandwich with a corn bread muffin, and Wilbur beans. Beans were sweet but tasty and the portion was small, in my opinion. Muffin was darn good and slathered in butter. The sandwich was good, the links were charred (which I like) and pulled pork was not too greasy. Pickles were a nice touch as well. The meat didn't have a very distinct bbq or smoke taste to it so I was a bit disappointed. Either way it's not a bad place to stop off and relax. Prices are fair. Good happy hour, too.",

Keep in mind, I grew up near Memphis, so I am pretty particular.  Sure, I can drive out of the way to a stand-alone BBQ and get more authentic Q, but sometimes you just want it quick, and you want it with six cornbread muffins.    Dave's fits the bill. The ingredients are high quality, the helpings heaving.  Their meats, whether it's brisket, pulled pork, chicken, etc. are always tender and delicious.",

As far as family meals out go this place is always an affordable treat . On a side note, we had famous daves catered at work for thanksgiving last year . The smoked turkey was so moist and smoky but a tinge of sweet. Honestly, the best I've ever had . I need to see if I can order some for this coming thanksgiving. Talk about a showstopper for the holidays .",

I ordered the whole rack and I'm glad I did because I had plenty to bring home, which I vacuum sealed and ate later on.  They had just the right smokiness to them and the ribs were so meaty, moist and delicious that I really did stuff myself as best I could, quite frankly.  Then, just when you think things couldn't be much better, they had mac and cheese that was made with jalapenos and corn.  What a great idea!  I was in heaven!  The coleslaw was fresh and tasted great with the mac.  As soon as the server put the plate in front of me and I saw that coleslaw, I knew it was going to be a winner because the colors were vibrant and it didn't look like it sat in the fridge for a day or two, like some restaurants.   I ordered a pecan pie for dessert and it was okay but not super great but it was warmed and had plenty of pecans.  It came with a nice little scoop of vanilla ice cream and a huge puff of whipped cream.  I made sure everyone had a spoon because I didn't want to be the only one eating it, that's for sure.    I can't wait to go back.  Good stuff!",

    "text": "Famous Dave's finally opened up near me in the Bay Area and I wanted to see what I had to say about the restaurant...color me surprised when I realized that in the 4 times I had eaten at Famous Dave's in Arizona, I had never written a review! Time to remedy that...  We came here on the weekend after it had first opened, back in 2006/2007. Service was good and snappy. Food was all right.  Without really knowing it, I had commented to hubby and our friend, \"I don't know what to make of this place, but something about it screams 'chain' to me. It doesn't feel very local.\" Sure enough, we got home and googled it...it's a chain.  While I dislike supporting chain restaurants (my experiences with BJ's is the one that comes to mind), this one made me go, \"ok, I can deal with it.\"  What hooked me was the corn muffin...which I dubbed the Corn Crack Muffin. Honey was evident throughout. I do not like honey, but it so worked on these muffins. I had to contain myself. I nearly made hubby go and flag a server down so I could eat his muffin (that sounds rude, doesn't it?) in his absence. The server liked us and I suspect it was due to hubby's Scottish accent...she kept bringing the Corn Crack Muffins. So much so that I was full when my food arrived.  I got the brisket and this is where the meal fell short for me - the fries were seasoned with so much salt that I was thirsty all night after. Portions of the brisket were not consistent with the pricing. I felt like I got ripped off. Food was just ok, but not enough to make me want to boost this up to 4 stars.  Server was great and I really commended them for the wonderful service in such a short time of being open. Most places take three months to a year to get it right.  The Manager was so enamored with hubby's accent that he gave us so many coupons and a couple of bottles of Dave's BBQ sauce, hoping to entice us to come back.  Make sure to get here early because it's situated right next to the Chandler Mall - it gets crazy and parking made me feel like I was in the Bay Area - fighting for that one spot that is remotely close to my destination.  Now...on to writing the review for the one on Dobson.",

    "text": "So I was craving bbq a while ago and asked my lunch buddy to try this place with me. He looked at me funny and said \"YOU have never been there??\" So off we went. Famous Dave's has the regular decor you would expect at a BBQ joint; wooden furniture, country decor... very standard. We were greeted and seated quickly. A VERY flustered waitress came to our table nearly out of breath and asked \"Have you guys been helped yet??\" I sighed silently, bracing myself for poor service. To my relief a very polite waiter came over and said that he had taken our table and would be very happy to help us. GOOD call! Our waiter could not have been more polite and fast. I just wish I could remember his name because he was awesome!  I was famished so I got the baby back and meat combo. For the meat I chose the hot link sausage. Our waiter explained each of the sauces that were on our table to us. He even told us our food would arrive in 5-10 minutes. DING! 8 minutes later, my food had arrived in front of me. With the meat, I got two sides which were macaroni and cheese, and green beans. Man was everything good! The ribs were nice and tender, the hot link was smoky, but not terribly spicy. It was so good! The macaroni and cheese is REAL macaroni and cheese. If you eat comfort food, you know what I mean. The green beans had potato and onion in them which is yet another southern touch! I loved everything and it was a lot of food.   I don't know if I can make Famous Dave's a regular stop, but I would love to! I will return there again next time I'm craving good bbq!",

    "text": "Full... so... full!!  It was over 36 hours ago that I had Famous Dave's BBQ... and I'm STILL full!! I was frustrated with my so-called-friends of my so-called-LIFE! and I decided to seek a nice evening instead a drama-filled night of pulling  Chinese Fire Drills on the southside of town. So I hollared at the sis and consulted Yelp to see where a great BBQ place is... Dave's was at the top of the list.  After hours and hours of texting - we were set! We got there on a Friday evening at around 7pm or so and there were several parties ahead of us, naturally. We were told it was a 25 minute wait. So we went outside to play with my new camera. Not even 15 minutes later - we were called to out table. YAY!  We sat down and I immediately started the BBQ Sauce taste test! Pouring them onto what was apparently where our used bones go. (ew) We tasted each kind and chose our favorites. Their Sweet & Zesty and Rich & Sassy (is that right?) sauces were my faves. I couldn't hang with the Geogria Mustard sauce nor could I take the devil's spit. I looove hot food, but I wasn't feeling the sauce. The Texas Pit was CRAZY-AWESOME! but it just didn't mesh well with the flavor of the bbq.   I was lobbying for The Feast the entire way there!! and YESSS... the sis and cousin agreed!! I had to ask the intertribal table battle cry... Are you HUNGRY... or are you STARVING?!?! the answer is ALWAYS starving!! haha!!   While an ENTIRE chicken, a WHOLE slab of pork ribs and half a briskit  were being prepared along with our corn on the cob, cole slaw, beans, french fries & corn bread muffins... we dined on fried catfish. Seriously - I didn't dig it. I think it was the flavor of the fish itself but the sauce it came with tasted pretty rad especially when mixed with the Texas Pit sauce! :)  And then... The Feast arrived! Served on a trash can lid... that I'm PRAYING has atleast been hosed off before hitting our table! :P It was HUGE, it was beautiful! :D I'm sooo glad we ordered it! We each grabbed our tong (it came with three) and we just dug in! I had two plates of food and I was STUFFED! I was in hog heaven!! I had several ribs and the BEST briskit i ever HAD!! The meat was perfect - the biggest letdowns was in the side dishes.  The corn was obviously frozen at one time - but still good. The beans were oniony (i don't like onions) so I didn't dig 'em. the fries were VERY salty... but still good. I wish we could have had more cornbread muffins. But I MUST say - the cole slaw was probably the best I have EVER had! Crazy yummy!  At the end of the meal - we couldn't hang. There was a huge amount of chicken left and and a few ribs and a TON of fries and we didn't even touch the beans. We took home two to-go boxes and still left some food on the our trusty trash can lid. We got to the car, to-go boxes in hand and I just wanted to lower the seat and just SLEEP! It was so good!!  I will DEFINATLY be back! It was crazy yummy. There were serious smoke rings in their ribs! their sauces were tasty and had zing to spare! Their prices were a lil high. (nearly $60 for The Feast!) but it was worth EVERY penny!! I am such a fan, I cannot imagine ever venturing into Chandler Mall's food court again with Famous Dave's being just a few steps away!",

The corn on the cob and corn bread muffin that come with the Platter are delicious as well. My husband enjoys the Texas Beef Brisket.  So far, I haven't found another BBQ restaurant in the Valley that's better!  UPDATE: I still really like the BBQ here, but we prefer the Mesa Riverview location as it's less busy. Hmm, I'm downgrading from a previous 5-star. That was probably a bit crazy anyway. : )",

    "text": "Came in for lunch today with my wife and kids. Hostess was somewhat nice she seemed like she did not want to be there. We waited for 12 min for a server to come and great us while other guest got service right away. Even beign there for 2 min. Once our server approached the table he seemed upset and looked like he hated his life. I can not recall his name but all I know he was an African-American male. Didnt bother to let us know about their lunch specials or even recommend any dishes. At that point I just wanted to leave but my kids were hungry. Food was great and to who ever ran our food and got us refills was an amazing server (not our server) he treated HIS tables with much respect and made them feel welcomed. As a General Manager to a local chain, I hate doing this review but Daves needs to know how their staff treats their guest. You have delicious food but service needs to improve. I will eat here again just wont be anytime soon!",

Then it kind of goes downhill. Putting aside their pathetic excuse for ice tea, food was not as good as i would hope for.  Chicken always boring in this kind of places, just a grill chicken smothered with bbq sauce, or at least this is how it always seems to me.  This is how it was at Dave's too, so i did not get any this time around. Instead i went with Georgia Pulled Pork and Sweetwater Fish. Fish was just like a generic fried fish sticks and unless dunked into one of the sauces was not any interesting. Pork was better but not awesome. It was not ....hummm... how do you explain this.... falling apart enough. Does this make any kind of sense? It felt like it was rushed out of the smoker. It could use more time in there for sure.  Corn muffing was good, corn cob was fine and spicy beans, while on the stranger side, were alright as well.   Their sauce rocks and makes anything taste like it = GOOD!  \"I like\"  Eugene",

I took a client out to lunch today, and he said, \"let's go to this BBQ place down the block.\"  You can imagine my pure joy when it turned out we were going to this palace of pork perfection.    Their lunch combos are under $10 and huge. I had 2 tasty ribs, a giant bbq chicken breast with wing attached, corn, corn bread, and coleslaw. It was as good as I remember.  Devil's Spit sauce is the shit. Don't even mess with the others, homie.   My only wish is that they had Diet Dr. Pepper. Seriously... If you aren't planning on getting totally plowed, you have to have Dr. Pepper with BBQ. Anything else is sacrilege.  4 not 5 because there is better BBQ out there. But not that I've had in AZ, unless I've made it myself.",

Our waiter (Evan) was fast and getting our drink orders and asked us if we were ready to order. It took us about 10 minutes to order because I was not sure what to order but we went ahead and ordered the Davsample platter and a big Caesar salad. The  sampler platter was very filling and there were so many things you could try. The ribs were phenomenal because you can taste the smoke flavor . The hot wings, fried chicken tenders and catfish were great as well. Everything in the platter was really good from the fries to the onion rings to the pickle vegetables.   The staff was nice and kept on asking us if we need anything else. Definitely make you feel welcome to this restaurant when you walking.  The restroom in the restaurant very clean when we arrived and looks like they maintain it pretty well.  The parking was plenty since it was located by the mall And they were seating outside the restaurant if you like to sit outside.   My experience ratings 4.5 out of 5 for food  4 out of 5 for Service  4 out of 5 for price/value 4 out of 5 for restaurant cleanliness   Total: 4.125 stars",

The ribs were a bit charred at the edges, which gave some juicy bites an overpowering taste of carbon. The Brussels sprouts were grilled perfectly to be slightly crunchy, but too salty. The mashed potatoes were too runny and felt more like baby food than mashed potato consistency. The cornbread was amazing!  Service was prompt and friendly, and the place looks great. They have plenty of booths that can fit at least 6 people, which isn't something you see in most restaurants!",

Slaw was to tangy to my taste but still ate it, so it wasn't horrible.   The restaurant was pretty noisy which I had no problem with, lots of fun sports games on as well as events so that figures. Plenty of room to get around and I really liked the set up for the outside seating.  Bathrooms were very tidy and clean which is a very big plus!   YUM!

The complimentary bowl of chips are generally good (sometimes a bit salty, but they make these fresh so that varies from one batch to the next...OK so that isn't consistent!).  Service is still good.  Brisket and ribs are probably their best things, which is what I had.  Add some sauce and they're tasty (actually, the ribs already have sauce, but the brisket needs it).  Corn bread is good.  Fries are good.  As it has been in my past reviews, so it is now.  We also got a dessert this time.  While I love chocolate I just can't deal with their chocolate brownie.  It is more walnuts than brownie. I don't like that.  A few nuts are OK, but it is astounding how many nuts they cram into a brownie.  Way too much for me.  I wish they had a no-nut option.  My wife likes the bread pudding, so that's what we got.",

    "text": "Twice a month now, we either eat here, or Famous Dave's comes to us. I mean, a dozen or so Famous Dave's employees warm up their BBQ truck and come to our front door. It's my company's way of saying thanks. And boy, do we appreciate it.   They assemble their Brisket, Chicken or Pulled Pork sandwiches, with sides of Baked Brisket Beans and a hundred and fifty of us go, wait for it: Hog Wild.  Trust me, there's no leftovers.   When eating in at the restaurant, we normally sit in the bar area. It makes for a quick get away. But when they come to us, wow the line goes around our office building.   There are luncheon specials, and if you tell them you are in a rush, the wait staff understands and makes it quick. Btw, I love their Brisket, but their Burgers are reasonably priced at $10.00 and have a nice BBQ taste.   Enjoy!",

However that changed quickly when the service was off the bat great, the bbq flavors were awesome! And when it came to the dishes I was stoked!   We tried s few different things I have to say the brisket was my all time Favorite Holy flavor and awesomeness!  Kid got the mini corn dogs. I also enjoy a great margarita (better then the last Mexican joint we went to ..... strange huh?)  Hubbs enjoyed a 20oz beer   We left full happy and impressed!!",

My husband's mom hadn't been so we knew she loved brisket and timing was perfect.  The food was good and server excellent.  Matter of fact, the servers were over the top.  The only complaint we had at this visit did not relate to the servers or to the food but rather to other guests who ignored their 4 or 5 children while they jumped on the tables, on the seats and ran yelling through the restaurant repeatedly.   It's really too bad management has to worry about offending the offenders and not about the rest of the guests who had their meals disrupted.  Overall, the brisket was excellent, ribs good but tough to get off the bone, beans were delicious and the rest just as good.  Great place to eat!",

I looked around and saw many empty tables so wondered why they would even make us wait but the lobby was full of waiting families.  Ordered the mac and cheese as a side to our family feast and did the waitress even mention it was spicy, NO! I have three kids under three and you dont mention that my side dish will burn their mouth and make them cry! I then brought it to her attention and she brought us a side of apples and said sorry about that.  Okay BBQ not AMAZING but okay!",

    "text": "I heard this place was really good. we had a large party. our server \"cisco\" was all over the place, took a long time for anything, messed up our order pretty bad and seemed to be first day on the job as he couldn't answer questions about entree's (all he said was \"it''s really good\"). Then there was some bigger guy with balding hair and i'm pretty sure he was a manager. This guy was helping running food out to our large party and i saw him from about 10 feet away kind of arguing with my 13 y/o son. my son had ordered mac n cheese with fries and this guy brought him mac n cheese with a pineapple slice. my son said he didn't like the pineapple and wanted the fries. i saw this big guy give my son a dirty look and said \"just take this one\" and set it down and walked away. right there is stood up and approached the guy and asked if everything was ok over there and he said \"yea it's all good, the kid is bugging me for fries but he can have the pineapple\". BUGGING YOU FOR FRIES??? isn't this a restaurant? I always thought in a restaurant you order what food you want off the menu and get it.....not take what the drop in front of you. come to find out, this plate of mac with a pineapple was another kid at the other end of the table. if this big guy would have just politely asked, then all of this would have been avoided. Soon after that one of  the parents were going to the restroom (right by the kitchen) and overheard this same big balding manager talking to some servers claiming how difficult our party was and couldn't wait for us to leave. Is that what a manager should think about a group of around 40 people? I would think that a group that large would bring in some nice money for the restaurant and that a manager would be happy and not complain about his guests like that (or at least where he could be heard). to top it off a few people (about 9) got sick from the food. not sure what they ate, but i had the BBQ chicken sandwich and it was OK. OK meaning i didn't get sick and the taste was average. to sum up this review, it was my first ever experience at a famous Dave's BBQ and will most likely be the last, at least at this location. As for that big manager, maybe you should go work as a dishwasher, that way you can complain all you want to the dirty dishes and your guests will not have to experience you poor attitude.",

Call yo momma if you wanna cry about it but I don't care. Mention Famous Dave's and it's like Ali Baba shouting out Open Sesame! All of a sudden my mood changes and I am so THERE! Mind you this is even if I'd just been here earlier in the week. I'm a sucker for BBQ. That ain't no lie. No go dickie die! So I've lost count how many times I've been here. Sure, count my check-ins but I forgot how many times I didn't even BOTHER checking in. So anyway, we always come in big numbers. Well, no less than 5 usually. We know the drill, corporate video trains the servers to make a stupid happy face on the little plate with the sauces for us to dip the potato chips in. One of us usually hides the plate to prevent that from happening. LOL. I usually get the St. Louis Spare Ribs. That's right. Pork ribs. I am male, hear me roar. Arrrrr!!!!!!! Beef ribs are for metrosexuals and grade schoolers. PORK. RIBS. The Jews and Muslims knew what they were doing keeping their folks away from the Devil's meat. PORK. RIBS. The Devil's fingers we call em'. Every bite gets us one step closer to artery clogging hell. But you gotta live sometime, right? So anyways, this is a great place to do it. A religious shrine to pork. If there's any BBQ chain that's doing it right it's Dave's. Right off that street that circles around Chandler Fashion Center - Dave's has its own lot with plenty of parking. As long as the spirit is willing and the pig flesh is tasty I'll be coming back here again and again.",

Luckily they were able to get us seated fairly quickly which was surprising.  Unfortunately our seats were at one of those long benches that has multiple tables spaced out along it.  So right away I was a little unhappy just because I value my personal space and don't particularly enjoy sitting elbow to elbow with the stranger sitting at the table next to me.  The waitress was friendly and came by right away to get our drink orders.  She came back with them pretty fast and then took our meal order.  We didn't have to wait long for that either as that came out quicker than expected too.  The food was good as expected since I've been to Famous Dave's before (I would go just for their corn bread!).  I'll definately be going back just probably not on a Saturday night which also happens to be a holiday....",

Loved the Burnt Ends appetizer--small chunks of caramelized brisket served with pickled onions and  spicy pickle slices. They also served a small bowl of complementary kettle-cooked potato chips which were awesome. I can't believe they don't package and sell them.  The chopped pork was moist and flavorful and so was my husband's brisket. The beans were delicious and not overly sweet and salty as in a lot of bbq places. Excellent cornbread. And the mac and cheese was unique in that it had whole kernel corn and jalapeno in it--very tasty! The garlic mashed potatoes were just ok.  Great bbq sauces--my favorite was the Georgia Mustard and hubby liked the Sweet & Zesty so much he bought a bottle on his way out!  Overall great bbq-- a LOT better than Rudy's or Can't Stop Smokin' which left both my husband and me underwhelmed when we tried them early this year.",

I arrived about 30 min before closing (after flying in) and they were very courteous and seated me quickly, took my order, suggested some sides and got the food to me quickly and very hot and fresh.   I had the catfish fingers (yummy!), the two meat combo ( baby back ribs and chopped pork) corn muffin, corn on the cob, Cole slaw, and cheesy Mac (had corn and jalapeno peppers in it) with sweet tea. Lots of food and I took my time and as it was all so good ended up only taking the corn muffin home with me and it was great the next morning with my coffee. All during my time there they checked to see if I needed anything else, kept my tea full and provided excellent, non rushed and friendly service.   I'll say it again good food, service and excellent experience overall. I highly recommend a visit and I will be returning when in the area.

Yes its a chain and their t-shirts are hokey but their food is probably some of the best BBQ I have eaten.  My favorite entree is the catfish fingers (which they discontinued *boo*).  There is a selection for any picky eater.  I'm not a big red meat eater so its refreshing to have so many chicken and pork selections.  The side dishes are probably what seals the deal for me.  My favorites are the mac and cheese and wilbur beans.    The only misgivings I have are:  #1) The manager needs to stay in the kitchen and not check with every diner how things are going..  #2) I try not to eat in the bar area, they tend to spend more time doing drink orders since it is the bar.  All in all it is probably in the top 5 of restaurants that I eat at regularly.",

The hot links are good, but not as wonderful as the other stuff. I buy their sauces for home and go through Devil Spit like water.   Service is always good too. They also do a great job at catering. They handled food at an event I recently coordinated and they handled 200 plus people very efficiently.   I highly recommend Famous Dave's to anyone who likes barbecue. There is better at certain mom and pop places in the South, but again, I put it up against anything in Phoenix--even Joe's in Gilbert.",

At an instant tasting the very hot source, I hick up not stop for a minute before I can continue with my burger. Devil spit or even the milder texas spit is good enough. And texas spit definitely wont kill your taste buds just dont go crazily dipping the source",

We sat there for about good 15 mins before the a waiter acknowledged we were there when he walked pass by a few times to wait on the table right next to us. Brought us drink but forgot the straws said he will be right back with them but never did. The service was very slow. I don't know what happened but 3 of the tables that was there after we did got all their food before we had ours. Finally the manager brought us our food. We had no BBQ sauce on the table and waiter never come back to check on us. I have to admit I'll only come back to this place only for the food and not expecting so much out of the service.  Rib tips was really good and come in a  big portion. Raspberry Martini was yummy.",

So I ask the manager why we were told they would be turned on if they didn't work, then he stated he didn't know who told us that but they don't work,  I explained it was hot out and if he could discount the bill a little for the inconvenience since we were spending over $100 to eat in heat. He agreed, well we got a whole $12 off a bill of $210!!!!!!! And we still tipped $30 will not be returning to this location ever again ill stick to the west valley locations because this ones employees obviously needs to be retrained on customer service!!",

The service is always great, very friendly and helpful.   The bbq is also excellent.  I love everything from the rib tips to the wings.  The brisket can be a little dry at times so just a heads up.  I usually always get the pulled pork and some spare ribs. Love the corn bread muffins.   Also if you like a good spicy BBQ sauce. Try mixing the Devils Spit with the Texas Pit.. Definitely a must for me when I go here.  I also love that they are still one of the few places that give Vets a free meal on Veterans Day.  Give to the community and the community returns in kind.  Can't say that about many chain restaurants.",

Our party of 13 was quickly seated and our server gal was quick, friendly, and did an outstanding job of taking care of us.  Our food did take a while to come out, but I do believe that is expected when a party of 13 orders and backs up the kitchen.  The atmosphere is a typical BBQ lunch place; lotsa chotchkies on the wall;  I do like that they have a hand washing station stationed right smack in the dining area - I was able to quickly wash before and after my tasty BBQ meal (lotsa sticky fingers); they also are generous with big bottles of about 5 different BBQ sauces on the table as well s giant rolls of brown paper towels (smart!).  I ordered the two types of chikens they had on their lunch menu and for $9 I got a whole lotta chicken.  It was smoked and tasty and my side of broccoli was cooked well (not over steamed).  I am not a big fan of their BBQ sauces because they taste *really* sweet, but a little here and there was enjoyable.  I think it is a great spot for a group lunch - we were seated quickly, served appropriately, had a filling meal, it was a good value, and easy with separate checks.",

Most of food was good.  A second mgr female this time came by and asked  how things are.  Advised food good but drink had been different story. She did not give her name either. She offered me a drink. i declined at this point. When we were half done, server asked if we wanted dessert and we declined and she brought boxes before we even asked.

My Birthday had come around and my genius boyfriend of 3 years opts to take me out to Famous Daves (and I thought he would be wasting his time and money).   I gave the BBQ pork \"1 last go\" before I gave up on BBQ forever, and unbinoxed to me I LOVED IT!!   Now I'm \"BBQ addicted\". We have gone at least 5x the last couple of months.   They're so darn good I changed my life-long mind. How bout that? p:",

A couple of the pieces were nothing but fat. Asked for something leaner, they brought the same fatty brisket out. Awful and I can't believe they expected someone to eat it.",

But I love salad, and it was a winner.  My husband had the chicken dinner and it was delish.",

We arrived and they told us it was going to be a 10-15 min wait, however the host was telling everyone this and we ending up waiting 35 minutes. Then when we go to our table finally,  we ended up waiting again another 15 minutes to be greeted by the server. It took her 10 minutes to bring out the chips they serve for the sauces and then again we continued to wait for our food. The food then arrived and  no one came around to check on us until we finished our food, then again we waited for her to take our card but instead we just decided to leave cash. We were there a total of 2 hours which is ridiculous seeing how we are fast eaters. The restaurant was not that busy, there were plenty of servers on shift, so this should not have happened. If you are in a hurry do not some to this location.",

On this most recent visit, I ordered a drink & our server has ignored us for most of the time we have sat here.  The other patrons around us have his attention, but everytime I try to wave him down he ignores me.  I only saw the manager walk around once but hasn't seen him around since.   I live near by, but with there customer service I would rather go to the Mesa Riverview location. They are more friendlier there & are always on top of things.   Don't get me wrong, the food at Dave's is good, I'm just disappointed on the 3 different visits to this location have all been the same.",

She then had to call I believe her manager over to override and redo the balance on the card...I paid then I needed change. Well I guess the cashier couldn't get into the drawer so she called the manger over again. And from there the customer service when down hill. Everyone had an annoyed or pissed off look on their faces. Then they proceeded to slam the register drawers in front of me. I get it's frustrating but it wasn't my fault things didn't go smoothly. I just felt as if they where angry at me for even coming in to buy the gift card.",

Unbelievable great bbq at reasonable prices.  We used to be able to say that about Honey Bears, but not lately.  Too bad as Honey Bears has been around a long time.  St. Louis ribs, baked potato, tasty slaw, Zesty and Tangy bbq sauce.    Only one complaint, no white bread.  Not everybody likes corn bread believe me.  So, we supply our own white bread at home.",

    "text": "I have been to Famous Daves twice. The first time I went to San Tan with my family and it was wonderful. This time at the Chandler location (which I am only writing the review for) I could not have been more disappointed. I have worked at a restaurant when I was young and I know the frustration with people coming in late at night but this was out of line.   My girlfriend and son came in this last Sunday at 845 (they close at 10). There was immediate tension and annoyance shown by the staff when I asked for the television channel to be changed to watch March Madness. I wasn't trying to be rude at all only asking twice, but there was 5 minutes left and I didn't want to miss it ! Well the staff struggles to figure it out as I watched everyone looking so confused about to how to get that done. Either way I got to watch the last 45 seconds so there's the one star this review got. The food was very good our last visit so we were very excited to eat so that wasn't going to ruin anything ! We ordered the family platter ( feast for two ) that serves 2-3. Extra side of Mac and cheese because I remembered how good it was from the first visit, and two waters and one iced tea. The food came out in less than 15 minutes which was great ! Maybe too fast now that I think about it. We ate and enjoyed our meal, stayed till 945 and tried to leave so that we weren't trying to just lounge around till close. We even took home plenty of leftovers.   Later that night at 1am, I had a family in crisis fighting over the two bathrooms in our house. All of us vomiting and having to use the restroom till we were restless. This had finally ended late last night. (This was also the first time we had all eaten together, my girlfriend works nights so she had just woken up and this was her first meal of the day.) Therefore, there food was the source. We called yesterday to alert them of the issue (not asking for compensation never would do anything like that) for the sake of other late night eaters that may go through the same thing. They told us a manager would call because only supervisor Paige was there and she could not handle the issue. No response that day. Called again and Paige said she must have wrote the phone number down wrong because she had called us and there was no response. Really ? Well that's when I knew I needed to write a review. Welp, that 50 dollar meal and 10 dollar tip was a waste, even threw the leftovers away because there is no way I could go through an experience like that ever again ! Just a warning, if you feel like the staff is pushing you out the door and half doing their job (maybe not even capable of doing it) beware your food may not be cooked correctly just because employees want to start cleaning before the place is closed. So Instead of me telling the manager, I have decided to write a review for all of you to know how my experience was. Thanks for reading.",
