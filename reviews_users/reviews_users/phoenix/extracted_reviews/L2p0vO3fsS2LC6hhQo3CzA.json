The employees were all very nice and accommodating. The menu is small but covers all bases: pancakes, scrambled, & breakfast sandwich. Our breakfast was prepared quickly! I really appreciated they use cage free eggs, extra virgin olive oil, & real butter! I was pleasantly surprised to see all of the improvements to downtown Phoenix!",

While taste and food quality is much better than typical chain restaurants, its nothing I can't prepare in my own kitchen. That said, the fresh squeezed orange juice is amazing! I will go to Matt's just for that!!!! My husband and I joke that it is a version of Village Inn for a younger and health conscious generation. We will continue to return as long as we live here!",

That being said I will give them credit for being able to scramble an egg.  Most places don't know how to do this properly (trust me most places make an omelet and chop that up and call it scrambled eggs...its not).  This is a small place and it seems like everyone in Phoenix is trying to eat there.  So one really irritating note.  The place is crowded, I'm waiting and I see two people finished with their meal just drinking coffee.  I get seated...they're still sitting there.  I get my food...they're still sitting there.  I eat...they're still sitting there.  I pay my bill...they're still sitting there.  I leave...they're still sitting there.    WTF!!!!!!  People are waiting and you're just sitting there.  To make matters worse they pulled out a jug of Arizona Tea and started drinking that.  Double WTF!!!!!!  I guess the management of Matts are too nice and don't bounce people when they should. I'm not sure if that's a good quality or bad.  What I do know is I just saw two of the most inconsiderate people in Phoenix today.  Probably a 3.5 versus a 4, but that wasn't a choice.",

I ordered an egg sandwich--which was good and I liked. But I also ordered a side of potatoes--they were covered in oil and an excessive amount of rosemary. The potatoes were completely inedible. When the manager came around to ask how our food was, he looked surprised when I told him the potatoes were inedible to me and had too much rosemary; he politely acknowledged me and told me he'd check with the cook(s) about it. When the bill came, I was surprised to see that I was still charged for the potatoes that I did not like and/or eat. I had to find the manager and politely ask him to remove them from my bill, and he did. It was decent customer service once I had to go out of my way to find someone, but honestly I don't want to go back. Not worth it when Phoenix is a city filled with brunch/breakfast places far better than this.",

I ordered the egg dish special of the day: -Egg scramble: delish, except I ended up picking out some bacon pieces  -House potatoes: made crispy and flavorful esp. with the rosemary garnish = addictive -Sourdough: perfect with their house strawberry preserve  Best part of Matt's is the hospitable service and affordable dishes.

It was a Saturday morning and the wait wasn't too bad, maybe like 20 minutes. So we got a table and it is crazy loud inside the restaurant. We had to put out heads together to hear. They ordered our food and drink quickly and then we sat and waited which was expected as it was a Saturday morning. Then they brought out only my food without my husbands. So we sat waiting for about 10 more minutes  before they brought his out. We decided to split a stack of pancakes and get a few sides. So bacon and home fries and eggs with pancakes. The pancakes and eggs were delicious. I didn't care for the bacon. It had a weird pepper seasoning on it but it was thick and crispy. My husband did not like his home fries. They weren't cookies crispy just squishy. The food and atmosphere were mediocre but the price was too high for that. Extra syrup costs more money by the way.",

    "text": "I think everyone in Phoenix comes here for breakfast. Everyone. This place was packed with people eating inside, and with people waiting outside to eat. I probably waited 45-50 minutes to eat here. Was it worth it? Maybe. I had looked at the menu while waiting, so I knew what I wanted to order. I ordered the Chop and Chick, which is eggs made to order, and a pork chop, which I think they must use some sort of pesto rub or marinade. I had also heard about their strawberry lemonade, but they didn't have any that day! The server said they had blackberry lemonade, which also sounded good, so I ordered that to go with my breakfast choice.   The food came out pretty quickly. I had ordered my eggs over medium and my pork chop came with choice of hash browns or rosemary home fries and choice of toast (white, wheat, rye, and something else). I picked rosemary home fries and the wheat toast. The potatoes were delicious!!! Best part of the meal and I devoured every last piece. The rosemary flavoring was amazing. The wheat bread seemed to be made in house - it came in thick slices and was buttered. The server brought over (I think) blueberry preserves which went great with the toast. The pork chop was also really good, but the meat was a little on the dry side. I ate all of it, because I was really hungry after waiting almost an hour to eat. The lemonade was yummy but it was too sweet - would've been perfect if I added a little water to it.   Service was fine - it took a while to flag someone down to get the check and to pay.   Overall, I liked the ambiance - it's a cute and fun place, and obviously everyone likes to come here to eat breakfast/brunch. The piggy decorations are cute and I like the orange accents. What I ordered was okay - the potatoes were amazing. If I were to come back, I'd probably order something else (the Hog and Chick was the other one I was eyeing). They have a location at the Airport in Terminal 4, so perhaps I'll try to eat there and hope that it's not crazy busy.",

I'm here vacationing with my family from Austin, TX and staying in a downtown hotel so this restaurant is walking distance.   The wait was about an hour but I expected it since it seems to be a popular place. The hostess did a great job of keeping everyone in the loop of the status of seating and they even served cold water outside. There are several benches to sit as well as a couple of trees for shade.   After being seated the service was pretty fast. Our drink orders were taken promptly and shortly after was our food order. I ordered the griddlescakes and was quite disappointed. They were very dry and not at all what I expected. My cousin ordered the pork chop and eggs and his pork chops were dry. My husband ordered the pork and chick which was eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast. Everything on his plate was really good. The toast was amazing.   We had to ask to have our drinks refilled a couple of times but they did the best they could given the best they could.",

    "text": "I read about this place on Yelp and made it my mission to stop in before my flight on the last day of my trip. I thought I planned enough time, but with the July 4th holiday, the place was packed! Being packed is always a good sign and since I planned my time poorly, I almost didn't stay since there was a bit of a wait for a table. Since I was so determined to try their food, I ordered my meal to go. I got the cheese omelette with provolone, onions and roasted red peppers and an oj. The oj tasted so fresh, it was like it was from hand-squeezed oranges! I waited a bit for my omelette and started getting a bit nervous about making my flight. Right about when I was about to ask about my meal (maybe 15 - 20 mins since my order) it came out. I ran to the car to take off for the airport, but not before taking a bite. When I cut into my lovely omelette, it had mushrooms! There aren't many things I hate more I hate than mushrooms and I was so disappointed. Due to tight timing, I thought of just eating the home fries and sour dough toast and tossing the omelette, but decided to go back in and see if anything could be done. The host sincerely apologized and very sweetly promised to make it right. I explained I was in a super rush and she assured me it wouldn't be long. My meal was out so quickly, and I was so thankful. This time when I cut into my omelette it was perfect and was honestly one of the best brunch meals I've had in a long time. I am picky, but everything was perfect. I really appreciate a business that takes care of their customers and treats them with respect - THANK YOU. In addition, in the time I spent inside, I could see the staff hustling and interacting with every single customer. This seems like a great place for the locals and I would spend every Sunday here, if I lived in the area.",

My wife said it perfectly as we were eating an orgasmically great breakfast there yesterday morning. \"There are places that serve breakfast. And this is most places. And then there are those food establishments that pay homage to the very art of a hearty American breakfast.\" THIS is Matt's.   Oh, and the service is great too. For breakfast as an event, I can't imagine a better place. And not that you care, but I had steak and eggs with succulent crispy hash browns and buttery delicious sourdough toast. The steak was perfect. And the teeny cup of A1 sauce on the side? Way to keep it classy.  Their bacon is crispy thick peppery goodness. I'd like to take this opportunity to thank my five year old daughter for not eating her bacon.  And now I'm starting to weep again.  THE END",

The side of bacon is always perfectly cooked, and balances out the sweetness of the waffle.  The hash browns, lemonade, and fresh jam are also must-haves. sure, the wait sucks but if you stick it out the food is well worth it!",

The building is pretty small, so there are not many tables, meaning you could be waiting awhile. The food is definitely worth the wait though! I tend to get the pancakes, they are huge and delicious. I always get a cup of coffee, and it is always a good idea. This last time one of my friend's got the chili, and she said it was terrific. I love going to Matt's on Sundays for an after-church brunch, and I would say if you're on that side of town when it's open, go in and get some good food.",

I was happy to tip that amount and can understand the assumption, but when I ask \"where is my change\" I was disappointed at the response I got back.

The wait, admittedly is the worst part. However they do have a water dispenser and benches for you while you wait and if you are willing to sit at the bar the wait really isn't that bad. They do use locally sourced cartel coffee and not any of that burnt junk from *sucks so that's an instant win. The coffee refills are pretty much limitless and they keep em comin' which given the amount of coffee I tend to drink is an awesome thing. They even offer to get you a to go cup if you wanted to get coffee to go after you are done eating.   Sure it is tight quarters and it is noisy but none of that is why i docked a star. I wasn't even done eating and my tab was at my table. I didn't ask for it, it just came up. That I thought was lame and hence the 4 stars. Not sure what the deal was but whatever.. i'll still go back.. those pancakes... mmm...yummy !",

We arrived about 10:00 on a Wednesday morning. Even though it was busy, we were seated quickly. The service was efficient and fairly friendly. It was the food that wasn't amazing. We ordered the Wednesday special which was French toast and apple sausage; the Chick and Pig or Hog or something, which was bacon, eggs, toast, and hash browns; another Chick and Pig, this one with an up-charged ham steak and home fries. The pork and apple sausage was too sweet and had a very unpleasant texture. The French toast was ok, but certainly not amazing. My nephew gave it a six on a 1-10 scale. The home fries were lacking texture and were served less than hot. The worst part was that there were sprigs of rosemary cooked with them and on my plate. It was literally all I could smell - not good. The toast was thick and tasty - my niece devoured hers slathered in the house made strawberry jam served with it. The bacon and hash browns were very crispy (bacon was actually black around the edges) and pretty tasty, even if the potatoes needed salt. The scrambled eggs were a hit, too. The ham steak was just that, but much tastier than the sausage. Overall, breakfast was $50 out the door. We all decided it was not worth the cost. Oh, and a huge pet peeve of mine - the iced tea was flavored and we were not warned first. It was not to our liking. And what kind of place only serves RC from a can?? Blech.",

There's nothing to absorb the noise so all the talking was like a roar ringing in my ears. Not ideal for chatting with my family. I ordered the bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast. The food came out quickly. The homemade jam for the toast was really good. I did NOT like the potatoes as they had rosemary which ruined the taste for me. Their ketchup was even different. More of a marinara sauce consistency. It helped the potatoes but couldn't save them. I wish I had gotten the hash browns because they looked really good... But sadly I don't see a reason to return.",

I had a daily special which was an omelette with veggies and a side of potatoes. The toast and jam were fantastic!! Everything was delicious! They also have a house made hot sauce that is wonderful. I am not usually a hot sauce fan but this was so tasty and just the right amount of heat. It is a consistently good breakfast!",

    "text": "We walked here from the Hyatt on 2nd Street and it was an easy stroll. We queued up and got a few coffees to lift the early morning haze from our brains. That was some super tasty java, I must say. Great start.   We ordered the Waffle (well done) and Peppered Bacon and also the Skinny eggs with the side salad and apple chicken sausage and spinach mixed in with a single pancake side.   Holy Mother of Waffle Nirvana!!! I am still dreaming of that first crunchy, tender, savory and slightly sweet Waffle. It literally blew my doors off. The bacon was perfectly salty and peppery next to the sweet syrup. Ahhhhhh ... easily an addiction.   The skinny egg dish silenced my partner for a good five minutes except for the mumbled \"Oh my gosh, this is sooooooo good\" in between forkfuls of steaming hot eggs with gooey cheese and sauteed spinach punctuated by occasional \"pancakes so amazing\" ... and a sound that was almost an unintelligible bleat for the lemon dressed arugula salad.   Seriously good breakfast, folks. Service outstanding. Prices totally reasonable. Almost every table around us had at least one order of the Sunday Special Steak and Eggs. The steaks looked nice and plump and juicy and folks really seemed to enjoy them.   MBB is located near the University and I imagine there is a line around the block to get in here when schools in session. We had to wait 20 mins on Fathers Day which wasn't bad at all. Guess that might explain all of the Steak and Egg orders.",

The soda I didn't care for, we basically paid $2 for an RC cola can. Orange juice was about 3.50 so I didn't get that. The servers were extremely fast and there was always someone who was available for help. I'd definitely come back to this place!!",

They have nice seating out front and they also supply fruit infused water with little paper cups while you wait. The 45 minutes went by quickly and we were seated at a table in the back by the daily specials wall. For drinks, ordered the strawberry honey lemonade and that was amazing! The drink was refreshing and not too sweet with great strawberry flavor. I could seriously drink these all day long. For breakfast, I ordered the waffles which came with thick bacon. The bacon was thick cut and was cooked perfectly for me.. nice crunch but not burnt. The bacon seemed to be peppered whatever the seasoning the taste was good. The waffles had a good flavor to them but I wished my waffle had a nice and crisp outside with the fluffy inside. The entire waffle was soft which made me a little sad but it still tasted good. I tried some of my friend's hash browns and that was delicious! They were clearly browned in butter and had a really nice buttery taste to them and they were perfectly textured. Great crispy outside. I also tried another friend's home fries and those were delicious as well. They had a very distinct buttery rosemary taste. Another tasty item I sampled was the strawberry jam that came with the toast. It wasn't too sweet at all and had a creamy texture to it. I wish that I had that option for my waffles instead of the syrup because I don't like syrup and the jam was scrumptious.   The staff was really friendly and attentive. My boyfriend's coffee was never empty. They would continuously refill without us having to ask. They were super busy and still had great service!",

Coffee was good and food was even better ! I had a basic eggs and bacon plate with hash browns and it was very good. The other people in my party had biscuits and gravy and waffles. I should have ordered the biscuits and gravy because these looked amazing ! Service was outstanding and the food lived up to the hype ! If ever in downtown Phoenix check this place out !",

    "text": "Fact: Matt's Big Breakfast has pretty much ruined breakfast for me for all of eternity. Since first trying it a few years back, I've found that it's done so exceptionally well that I'm constantly making comparisons between Matt's and every other breakfast place in Phoenix. And my conclusion remains consistent:  Absolutely no one compares.  Thriving off of simplicity in a similar manner to Pizzeria Bianco, Matt's doesn't need 500 different types of pancakes, all with varying amounts of rubbish dumped all over them. Blasting thumpy music, making up stupid names for omlettes, or serving up liquor in the AM as a means to be \"edgy\" are all silly gimmicks that are absolutely unnecessary when your food tastes like this. The fact is, when your food is good, you don't need tricks and tactics in order to compensate. Keep the choices minimal, the dishes fairly traditional, and the quality high and you have an automatic formula for success. Don't believe me? Look at the lines on the weekend.  Practically all foods you find here are either homemade or outsourced locally. I'm told there's no freezer and technically, if food is fresh, isn't that the way it should be? I typically order the Hog & Chick, scrambling up my eggs with one or two of their cheeses. The bacon, which comes from the Pork Shop in Queen Creek, is thick, juicy, peppered, and absolutely fabulous. There is no bacon I've found that even comes close. Add in some hash browns (extra crispy) that have butter cooked directly into them, some toast that's complimented by homemade jam that's personally made by Matt's wife, and you're pretty much covered for a great morning meal. The jam can also be purchased separately by the jar for home use. Even their orange juice and honey lemonades impress!  The Five Spot, which is a sandwich that combines some of the ingredients I just mentioned, is also worth trying. Although I prefer being able to appreciate these foods individually rather than combining them all. Their griddlecakes and waffle are excellent, being served with syrup that's actually hot (other places should take note of this). Although I don't regularly order either, as they come at the expense of missing out on the smaller side dishes (unless your stomach has the extra space).  Service is good, food is great, and parking is a pain (an unwritten legal requirement for all good restaurants near downtown). I've been told they have a great lunch, but with breakfast this good, I don't think I have I'll ever have the willpower to order anything lunch-related.  French toast, which is strangely absent from the permanent menu, is actually a special on Wednesdays and also worth checking out.   Highly recommended!",

The 5 spot and hash browns came highly recommended by Russ, the bartender at Bitter & Twisted.    I would say the overall sandwich was good, the bacon was good, the roll was ok and the hashbrowns, while crispy on both sides, was runny in the middle!  Not great.  My sister had the home fries and said it was delish.  The honey lemonade was really good though.  Service was nice and efficient but I think overall, not worth the hype and/or wait.",

The lack of veggie options for omelets and in general needs improvement (this coming from an omnivore).  Honestly, I can make a better spinach, tomato, onion and provolone omelet at home for 3-4 bucks rather than spending ten (!) for their omelet with mushrooms, onions, and roasted peppers.  The hashbrowns are hashbrowns, not \"omg, the BEST hashbrowns I've ever had\". (seriously?)  I've lived about a half mile away for a little over a year and have only eaten there maybe two times.  There's no way in hell I'd wait over an hour to get in-- that's friggin' absurd.  Not being a contrarian, just really don't understand all the hype.  It seems as if it's one of those places that people feel the need to support at any cost because it has a reciprocal 'awareness and responsibility' factor that people love to tout as an indication of their good taste and discrimination..  (is it local? is it free range? is it local free range? if it's not, I won't eat there..  Can I get a dossier on the hen who laid my eggs?)  *yawn*  Hipster, please.

The pancakes were great, the hashbrowns were made to perfections.  The food is wholesome for the most part.  I ordered the special which was sausage and spinach.  The eggs were too buttery and watered down.  This was probably do to the fact the spinach was cooked down with too much fluids.  Instead of flipping the eggs so they were fluffy it appeared as the cooked took the end of the spatula and chopped the eggs.  Big mistake.  Orange juice was nice and fresh.  Overall is was not a bad meal but not the hype people made it up to be.  I met the owner who was very very nice.  She seemed to know how her food was cooked.  I just wish she looked at my plate before it went out.  The wait staff was not overly friendly and seemed a little blah for being a Monday morning.  Over all it was ok but not worth waiting in a long line like they normally have.  There are plenty of other places who will do a mediocre job and have better waitstaff.",

There was a long line to wait when my sisters and I showed up and wondered if it was worth standing in the summer heat for. Our thoughts were \"Come on, how good can you really make breakfast???\" My doubts were all erased the moment I bit into their delicious golden waffle! Apparently, they can make breakfast so good that it is worth waiting outside in the heat for an hour!!! And the joy continued...the thick cut peppered bacon was awesome as well as their sourdough toast. They have a homemade preserve to put on the toast that changes all the time since they buy local and seasonal produce. I have had their strawberry and plum preserves with the sourdough toast. Just mouth watering thinking about it. One of my sisters had the pork chop with pesto. Delish!!! And I am not usually a fan of pork chops. I have been there 4 times now and recommend it  to anyone!  One piece of advice: the best case scenario is to go as a party of 2 since so you might get seated quicker ;)",

The orange juice is freshly squeezed and they always have homemade jam and one different flavor for the day, the blueberry is outstanding! The pancakes are the best I have ever had in my life, fluffy and melt in your mouth! The portions are big, so be ready to eat.  The price's are a bit higher than most, but your getting local, organic ingredients that are cooked to perfection!!  The service is great and the staff is very friendly.  I would have to say, the only downfall to Matt's is the location, it is pretty small (but bigger than the last location they had) and the parking is extremely minimal! There have been a few times the wait is pretty long, but WELL WORTH IT!!  They do have a lunch menu (opened till 2pm) but we have not tried the other menu items, although it is on our to-do list...its always the breakfast for us! I highly recommend Matt's, get down there and be ready to grub!",

When orders would come up at the window, it was very obvious that the person behind the counter had no idea who the order belonged too. This resulted in plates set in front of the wrong customers. We watch my wife's order set for five or more minutes till it arrived. My order set for a couple minutes until the person behind the counter had to ask the waitress who it belonged to. As expected the meals were cold. Not only that but the food was three to four stars at the best. Coffee was cold and we made a comment to the person behind the counter. She was able to make fresh pots but again with a delay. A place with this good of a rating should be able to handle a full house but it didn't.

Matt, I think you should offer almond milk or soy creamer.  It's really not that big of a deal.  Better yet why don't you MAKE your own almond milk.  I am totally confident you can make us proud.  Don't get me wrong because I don't think it's a restaurant's duty to cater to EVERY type of patron unless it makes business sense.

    "text": "It finally happened! After an eternity we finally got to visit Matt's on a day (Veteran's Day to be exact) when the line was only about 10 minutes long. We've been hesitant about the new location after years of eating at the original location, would the new location totally suck, would the food be different, would it be \"downtown cold and impersonal\"? We had this fear that Matt's had hit the big time and that old comfy place was gone forever.  Well, not so. The area when you first walk in has an uncanny feeling that you are in the old Matt's. The same is True with that weird little closed off room in the front; it had a lot of memories of that weird little closed off room to the left when you walked into the old Matt's. The big dining room has the biggest changes, and guess what? I didn't dislike it. It had that loud high-school cafeteria feeling to it still, tables packing in tight, funky but not pretentious (hard to do). The overworked staff was just as much \"family\" as in the old Matt's. The menu looked identical, the prices looked about the same, the portions were ... okay, not so \"big\" as I recall. Big yes compared to Denny's for about the same price (eeech, like someone would actually choose Denny's) but to my memory not quite so overwhelming as it used to be.  Bottom line: the \"new\" Matt's is still Matt's to me. I'm flexible and I can adapt.  My rating is still zero stars, hated it, horrible food and service, cockroaches in the food, a place even a homeless person wouldn't eat for free ... that \"rating\" is for the newbies. Please stay away until us locals have had our leisurely meal at Matt's, then make your reservation for, um let's say, about 2 AM on a Tuesday and get your butt out of there in 5 minutes or less to leave some tables for us \"Matt-afficionados\".  Biggest NEGATIVE? They deleted all of the old reviews just because they moved to the other end of the same block. BOO!  That to me is just kind of chickenshit. If you want to be so pretentious, change your frigging name. Otherwise just man up to the fact that a review for Matt's Big Breakfast should be a review forever. You lost a whole star for that crap, Matt.",

It's actually really basic and there's not really much to choose from the breakfast menu. I ordered the cheese omelette with onions and for some reason the whole thing was super watery. I get there may have been a little oil or something from the onions but watery eggs are not really appetizing. I couldn't even finish my plate. My boyfriend ordered the pancakes, which aren't anything special or fluffy like other breakfast places we've been to. It's always so busy here so it's more like an assembly line and I feel like the servers are trying to get you out of there so they can seat more people.

Judging by all the baseball paraphernalia on fellow patrons, Spring Training and the World Baseball Classic were clearly a major influencing factor on the crowds. Perhaps other times of the year will be slower? I can't imagine trying to land a table on a weekend.   As for the food, I liked my omelete but the hash browns were the standout.

To tell you the Hod's honest truth I have had better breakfast at some local Greek diners and with bigger portions to boot. Maybe I went in with great expectations after reading the reviews and catching the Guy's triple D show, and was expecting manna from the God's. I had to chuckle when our name was called and proceeded to the hostess where we expected to be walked to our table but instead she pointed to a far away table and were told to it there, I guess there's a first time for everything. I would give Matt's a middle of the road review and it's worth a try if your in the area, but I for one would never wait more then 15 minutes to be seated it's just not the old.",

Now, as far as I've ever been told about dining customs, is that the bar, whether it be one that actually serves booze or what, is open seating and can't be reserved and the host can't make you give it up. Two other girls walked in and wanted a booth but the host told them to sit at the bar instead. We told the girls we were saving this one seat for our friend and the host came over and rudely said, \"YOU ARE NOT SAVING THIS SEAT!\" As our friend walks in. The other girls were like hey, it's all good, we wanted a booth anyways and he MADE US sit here. Rude as FFFFFFFFF. We were confused. But hey, Jobot is just a block away and I suggest you try their chorizo biscuits and gravy because it's AMAZING.",

The waitresses that work the counter remember your usual order after 2-3 times, and it's just a great experience.  The only reason I would put it a tiny notch behind Harlow's is that they don't have as diverse a menu, but that's not that big a deal to me, as long as I get my omelette.  Great breakfast place.",

At 8am on a Friday this place was packed.  Parking is terrible and they have a guy that makes you move or doesn't allow you to park in other lots so you are forced to find a spot on the street and walk.  The restaurant is smaller and very busy/loud.  They seated us fairly quickly and the service was very good.  The menu option are pretty basic and only have about 10 items listed.  I ordered the cheese omelet with home fries and sourdough toast.  My wife ordered the eggs, hash browns, bacon and sourdough toast.  Food was out within 5 min.  Again, no complaints about service.  The food though was nothing special and certainly not served in HUGE portions like many of the reviews claim.  I found the potatoes to be fine and the omelet to be an omelet (nothing special).  My wife's food looked like scrambled eggs from a buffet and hunk of soggy hash browns (literally where sitting in grease).  I would certainly go to other places (Biscuits, Butterfields..._ than Matt's again.  Unfortunately, there is nothing special about their food and, again, the parking terrible.",

My food came out with hash browns instead of home fries but since it took so long to get the food after ordering and since we weren't checked on anyways, there was no opportunity to correct the mistake.   The toast with our order came 5 and 8 minutes after our entrees hit the table which is baffling and unexcuseable.

Well this is not that place. Matt's delivers on everything you have heard (sadly this includes the wait).  Matt's is basically your favorite local breakfast spot on steroids. Rather than a run of the mill piece of bacon it's a thick cut peppered slice cooked to perfection, that is from the Pork Shop (see my review on them) in Queen Creek.  The eggs? Yeah they are awesome.  On a recent trip I went and got the Chop and chick which was a couple of great eggs coupled with a slap of pork that was not only gigantic but super flavorful. The hash browns are about as perfect as hash browns can be crispy outside but not burned and great potato goodness inside.  The coffee here was also really good and exactly what a cup of regular old coffee should be.  Service was great and they are very quick to make sure you are taken care of. The prices are right in line with what they should be especially for the quality of the food.  Only thing is be prepared for a wait if you here as they are pretty busy especially on the weekends.

Expect to wait a long time if you bring a bigger group.   Food is good, executed well and quality ingredients.  The waffle is great!   It's EXTREMELY LOUD in here and for that reason I probably won't come back.. I couldn't hear my breakfast companion at all which kinda ruined the point of going out for breakfast in the first place. Concrete floor, brick walls.. They would do well to make some small changes, hang up some fabric or canvas on the walls, panels on the ceiling to cut down on noise.",

The hash browns were too oily and didn't have much flavor. The best part of the breakfast was probably the strawberry preserve, which, well, wasn't supposed to be the star of the breakfast. The freshly squeezed orange juice was fine too. The service was pretty good, but the food just wasn't up to par.",

They do not have a huge various crazy selection of food options, which at first seems limiting but when you realize that what they do have and serve is done right, fresh and full of fresh local flavors. A++ to the all the people who make this a great breakfast spot!!!!!",

My sister and I didn't mind because we had a lot of catching up to do.  Our name was called and the Host asked if sitting at the bar was ok.  We said yes.  We started to sit down on the stools but decided that it was not very comfortable.  My sister noticed that there were two 2-tops available and asked the host if we could sit there.  He said that that was fine but to let him know ahead of time \"so that we didn't have to do this dance again.\"  We swallowed our pride and sat down.  The female server never smiled and we had to ask for another cup of coffee so she was probably \"slammed\" with tables.  The table next to us got their breakfast first even though they were sat after us.  We did get our food eventually by someone other than our server.  The food was fabulous as expected.  But please don't let the poor service keep you away.  I would have given all five stars had the service had been as exceptional as the food.",

I waited for nearly 15 minutes for a bowl of oatmeal and a coffee. After asking several times when my breakfast would be ready, and being told \"Just a couple more minutes,\" I realized that I was going to leave the restaurant without my breakfast.  I requested a refund, however, the manager couldn't figure out how to work the register to handle my refund so I left without my receiving my breakfast or refund.  The manager kept suggesting that I be patient while waiting for my breakfast and again when I requested my refund.  Unfortunately I had a plane to catch and didn't have the luxury of waiting over 15 minutes for breakfast or to get my money back.    In case they haven't realized it yet - The airport is not the place to ask patrons to be patient!  Don't waste your time or money at this establishment.",

You will not be disappointed! My friends and I all ordered the cheese omelet and let me tell you, it definitely lives up to the name of being a BIG breakfast. What I loved most about this place was the fact that it was so affordable for the size. I paid $12 for a meal and drink which I thought was a steal for the quality. Everything was fresh and tasty.   The overall ambiance was very cute and reminded me of a breakfast place back home. The only thing that wasn't big about it was the size of the restaraunt so be prepared to wait to be seated. We only waited 15 mins on a Thursday morning but I can't imagine the wait times during the weekend. Overall I cannot wait to go back, my stomach is getting hungry just thinking about it.",

It was not overly sweet either. Sausage waa grilled to perfection.   Had the scramble eggs with arugula salad. This was a light and refreshing dish to start the day.  Staff was very attentive!",

    "text": "3.5stars. What can I say about Matt's that hasn't already been said? Generous portions, fresh ingredients, seriously amazing toast. I never thought the day would come when I'd rave about toast, but Matt's thick-cut toasted wheat toast with homemade blueberry compote is what I crave when I think about homey brunch food now.   This downtown location has a small parking lot of its own. The inside is decently sized, but lines are out the door for lunchtime and brunch most days, weekdays included. Service is mediocre, not the most attentive because it's always bustling in here, and there have been a few times where I've needed to aggressively flag down a server to ask for coffee refills or to-go boxes.   Matt's has a small menu, but there are specials for each day of the week. The menu items stay consistent, and the daily specials are written up on a huge chalkboard at the back of the restaurant.   Drinks: Coffee is decent and comes with bottomless refills. The strawberry lemonade and honey lemonade are both really good and not too sweet, although they come with quite a lot of ice.   The Hog and Chick: Standard breakfast fare, this comes with two eggs, choice of meat, choice of hash browns or home fries, and a slice of thick-cut toast. The hash browns are made well, and I like the crunchy exterior and soft interior. I did notice that the first time I came, the hash browns were made perfectly and the second time they were slightly mushy in the center. Still good though. I tried the sausage links, and I don't know that I'd order them again.. maybe I'll opt for the ham next time. Eggs were well-cooked with a nice runny center.  Salami scramble: This comes with scrambled eggs and salami (additional toppings for extra charge), hash browns or homefries, and toast. I really like the homefries because they come with sprigs of roasted rosemary, which are incredibly flavorful. I've found the homefries to be consistent and delicious, especially with the house made thick ketchup. One thing that did disappoint me a bit was that the scramble was undercooked. When I got to the middle, the egg was still oozy and watery, which left an unappetizing puddle on the plate. I'd gotten a different scramble before where this didn't happen, but I think the chef probably just underestimated the cook time by a minute.   Cheese omelet: This omelet was so cheesyyyy. I thought the flavor was really good, and I really recommend adding in toppings (for an extra charge) because it really helps balance out the cheesiness and richness. I did find the inside a tad runny again, but it wasn't super noticeable with the cheese mixing in. This dish again comes with choice of potatoes and toast.   Toast: The toast here is so good it deserves its own mention. The thick-cut toast comes out sliced in half and smeared with butter. One of the servers said that they use an old-fashioned toaster (which must be magical), and the slice comes out perfectly crunchy on the outside but still soft and fluffy on the inside. The blueberry compote is made with fresh blueberries and sugar, and it always tastes fresh and not too sweet. I haven't always finished my meals here, but I've always finished the toast.   I'll be back to Matt's for its convenient location and comforting breakfast food, and of course the toast.",

    "text": "This is going to be my first 5 star rating but Matt's is definitely worth the praise.   My Girlfriend and I were looking for a trendy breakfast place on a Saturday morning in the downtown area and was surprised by the lack of Breakfast/Brunch places not including cityscape and local hotel restaurants. We picked Matt's off of \"restaurants nearby\" on a apple maps search.  For being downtown, there is generous parking. The corner property is open to off-street parking and diagonal additional parking on all adjacent streets. We walked in and put our name on the list and the hostess let us know we in line for a 30 minute wait. Honestly, I have waited 45 minutes to an hour at iHop so 30 minutes it reasonable. Even more reasonable when you factor in that there were people lined up around the block for this place.  We got seated at the window bar facing the street and make pleasant small talk with some of the other patrons. After looking on the menu, we were slight disappointed to not see eggs Benedict on there. I ordered the Hog and Chick and he ordered the Grains Greens and Beans. Water and refreshments came quickly and I like the pulpy cloudy apple juice. You could tell it is fresh.  Our food came out in about 10 minutes and it was everything I expected. the Ham off-the-bone looked charred and straight from the grill and the thick cut bacon was a SLAB of pork sprinkled with pepper bits. AMAZING. My GF's grains were fresh and flavorful combined with the fresh earthiness of the mushrooms.  Our bill came out to $43 because of some the extra sides I ordered. Pricing is very fair and the food was a tremendous value. I wish this place was closer to our house, but Matt's is definitely worth the drive on a Saturday or Sunday Morning. The pictures do not even do this place justice.",

    "text": "I visited Phoenix for the first time a couple months ago because my friend moved out west. Being a big Diners, Drive In's, and Dives fan, I decided I need to try a couple spots since Guy almost always ends up in Phoenix or Bakersfield, CA every episode. I specifically remembered on the plane the episode with Matt's Big Breakfast...it's amazing what you remember, considering that episode first aired 5+ years ago.  For the daytime portion of my trip, I was alone to discover what Phoenix has to offer as my friend had to work. I'm completely fine with that, and the morning after my arrival I set my off to find Matt. I was pleasantly surprised to find it was only about a 20 minute walk from my hotel, which was perfect considering the weather was 60 with a slight wind. (I didn't know Phoenix had wind!?)  I arrived shortly after 10am to a filled restaurant. Luckily I was by myself so the hostess was able to seat me almost immediately at the bar. I had decided on the Skinny, but the scramble of the day was almost the same but with a different sausage. I decided to go with the daily special and waited only 10 minutes tops for my food. I was surprised by their ability to get food out to me; perhaps their motto of serving simple food makes it easier to serve food fast? Whatever the case, I was very impressed. The scramble, along with the accompanied potatoes and sourdough, were hot and delicious. The scramble was flavorful without being too cheesy, and everything was seasoned perfectly. I didn't add salt or pepper to my meal, and it's very rare that I don't.   They live up to the name of Matt's Big Breakfast - for some reason I took my leftovers home even though I had no intention of eating them.  (Not because they weren't delicious, but I was only there for 4 days! I had many places to eat at!) Guy Fieri, thank you good sir, you done good man, you done good.",

    "text": "Always a wait and hype so had to try it and was pretty disappointed.  Here's my breakdown.  We're gonna brave the lines a second time to see if was a fluke and bad day and adjust accordingly.  Very well put together and incredible looking meal; 10/10 for looks.  Rude and aggressive wait staff which is understandable from the lines but maybe be a little nicer?  Felt very pushy with the exception of the women working the Counter.  Home Fries were smothered in so much rosemary it tasted like soap.   My first experience with that ever as I usually am into rosemary potatoes.  Bacon tasted pretty dang salty and had a texture close to rehydrated beef jerky.  Very tough, and not really a bacon flavor just kind of salt and I'm not sure.  Eggs were ordered over easy,  they came out raw and clear in a few spots which I braved instead of sending them back; food poisoning today which I accept responsibility for as I ate them but they should air on the side of caution when preparing food like this.  Hollandaise sauce was neither good looking or delicious.   0/10 maybe that's why it's a once a week thing.  Ham was excellent but I feel like maybe it was just a honey baked ham?  Ordered that way and reheated?  No idea but delicious for sure.  Overall I've had tastier and more satisfying meals for 1/4 the price at Denny's and waited 1/4 the time.  This place is probably great to take that hipster girl / guy and pretend your a foodie or sophisticated but honestly you are better off going to the plethora of other options in the valley for a more satisfying experience.  Skip the lines pick another spot.",

    "text": "I am here in downtown Phoenix for work. I am from Philadelphia, PA. I decided to treat myself to Matt's Big Breakfast - which is a stone's throw from my hotel. I love breakfast at anytime and noticed the lines out the door on weekends so...  I chose the #2 Special: Egg scramble w/pork tenderloin, fontina cheese and spinach. If just a PINCH of salt + pepper were used to flavor this dish it would have tasted that much better. As it was: the eggs were overcooked, the pork was dried, the spinach used was old and the overpowering taste was the cheese - which usually tastes great but in the large amount in my dish today it completely overpowered everything. I used a LOT of ketchup. ...and my Mom used to say: \"If you are using ketchup on anything then the cook did a bad job.\"  Is there such a thing as to \"friendly service\"? I was asked 5 times by no less than 5 employees how things were going: twice with food in my mouth, once when I quietly was taking a call from my kids and once when I was actually drinking - and the waitress, not mine, btw, stood there with a sour look holding plates she cleared from another table waiting for me to finish drinking so I could answer her. I said \"I have a waitress already, thank you.\"  I thought with the ingredients, the location and the popularity the VERY high prices were probably justified but I was not expecting my meal to taste less than good. And at $4.95/glass getting another orange juice would have put my bill at almost $25...that is a ridiculous price for one person to pay for a bad breakfast.  I could have all of the above (and the oj refill) at any one of the many great diners in and around Philly for under $12 bucks and it probably would have tasted better.",

Oh well, the food is great, hands down.",

    "text": "Yummazing!! We were in town for a Limelife conference and thankfully, a friend woke up and found this place not far from our hotel. If you are going with a group, be sure your entire group is there when it's time to be seated or they will pass you up until everyone arrives. I totally get this policy because this place was packed and they didn't need someone taking up a table waiting on their friends.   On to the food and let me tell you, the food is worth the wait. Our table ordered a stack of pancakes and a waffle to share so we could all get savory breakfast items as well. The pancakes were fluffy with a hint of vanilla sweetness but sadly, I didn't get to try the waffle but it looked tasty.   I ordered the two egg breakfast and since it had been an exceptionally long night, I opted for bacon and sausage, both of which are local and I think, house cured. The sausage had a bit of a kick and the bacon was thick and cooked to perfection. The aroma of the rosemary home fries would provide a pleasant waft of love and a flavor explosion when they hit your taste buds. The eggs were cooked just as ordered. I was pretty much done but decided to try the fresh sourdough toast with the strawberry jam and man, am I happy I didn't let that one slide. The jam tasted just like my great grandma's homemade strawberry jam and I felt as if the strawberries had been picked fresh that morning. I know that's not possible, but it was very tasty.   Anyway, if you are Phoenix regular or are visiting, give this delicious breakfast joint a try.",

We both ordered the sweet and savory French toast special with pork/apple sausage, it was so delicious. The pork sausage is one of the best I've ever had, I could tell it was made locally and with top ingredients! The service was great too. One negative is that they use plastic straws, would love to see those phased out! If we're in the area again we'll be back!",

I ordered the special of the day, which was a scrambled egg bowl with jalapenos, cheddar cheese, and sausage (which was supposed to be turkey sausage, but they ran out) with a side of home fries and a warm tortilla. The person I was with had the same.   And it was delicious. The scramble was cheesy and spicy, with the sausage providing some extra zip. The home fries were excellent too and had a hint of sage. Definitely try the homemade ketchup while you're there too, it's a good compliment.   It is worth mentioning that this place is busy: like very busy. Our empty coffee cups remained that way probably much longer than they should have. We weren't alerted to the lack of turkey sausage for 20 minutes after we ordered. The waitress was very kind in apologizing. Just be aware that this place gets backed up.",

I had the cheese omelette and hash brown and the portions are h u g e. The top of the hash brown was nice and crunchy (and really good after you add a little more salt and ketchup) but the inside was a little soggier than I would like and I think it's because it's so thick. The omelette was really good - not too much cheese - but needed a little salt and pepper for more flavor.",

It was basically your traditional eggs over easy with hash browns, toast, and bacon.  It looked amazing. The Belgian waffles came with bacon and it was real good.  Some of the service staff was a little rude.  Granted, we came in around closing time, so the waitresses were tired and a little snarky.  We tried to get there after the rush, but no one likes it when you come in close to closing.  I understand.  We tipped big.  I'm just recounting a memory... I give 4 out of 5 stars because the ambiance isn't great.  It's a mix of diner/trendy eatery bar feel without the bar.  It's small.  They also sell their own products which is tacky to me - Matt's Ketchup and such.  The bacon was super peppery.  I was talking to my friend and coughing because of the amount of pepper and I like spicy.  They could have worked on ramping up the ambiance - making it more special and less Kitsch.",

In addition to their menu they also feature a daily special.  Earlier this morning I tried their 3 egg scrambler (today's daily special) and it was superb. Scrambled eggs with habaneros, protein and choice of potatoes (I chose hash browns).  The eggs were delightfully prepared, not too soft and not too well done. Just right. Big pieces of habanero were intimidating but had just the right amount of heat. The hash browns were excellent: crispy exterior and nice and soft inside. One big slab of goodness. BTW, great coffee too.  The restaurant is small so expect a wait. But it's well worth it.",

The bread used for toast was legit artisan bread. So good and hearty.  Only complaint: they didn't have half and half for coffee! Had to use almond milk or regular whole milk.

My first thought was this food better be fantastic. We waiting to be seated for 45 mins outside in the heat, granted they made water with lemon readily available it did not sooth the blistering heat. Once inside we were seated and I thought as an owner if you see demand you would get a larger location. I had the omelet with hash browns and honey lemonade. The meal was organic and fresh. I have a taste of the waffles and it was like it was served by an angel from the kitchen of the almighty. That's how good it was! I would return with intentions of waiting or preplanning better.

I got the daily special which was the 3 egg scramble that included chorizo sausage and jalapenos w/ hashbrowns and substituted my tortilla with sourdough toast and their famous jam. You can't go to Matt's and not get their toast and jam! Their potato fries with rosemary are also a must try! Every time I go I must have a large fresh squeezed OJ, none of that boxed stuff!

    "text": "We've been back to Matt's Big Breakfast quite a few times now and after having had breakfast food at many other places in the valley, I have to update my review to 5-Stars!  I think that if you're a fan of breakfast foods then you'll be a fan of Matt's. My favorite item to get there is the cheese omelette (except I ask for it to be scrambled) with mushrooms, a side of the house potatoes, and sourdough toast. They serve all omelette dishes with 3 eggs so it's definitely a generous portion. Same for the potatoes, you'll get quite a bit of those as well, and they offer you an option of regular hash browns or the house potatoes. The house potatoes have lots of seasoning & taste different with rosemary ... I recommend trying them out! Even the toast tastes great as it's thick cut sourdough, and they serve it with yummy homemade preserves.  The only annoying parts are the parking situation and sometimes the wait time. Parking can sometimes be challenging to find and the wait time can be long if you are part of a large group. Either way, the food makes it all worth it!",

    "text": "I've heard about this place from so many friends and colleagues that I had to try it for myself.  So, I head into downtown Phoenix between breakfast/lunch to grab a bite.  I got lucky and found a parking spot in front just down the street....be warned though, it's metered parking and it's an old school meter, so you need quarters & dimes.  I only had enough for 45 min, so I prayed that it wouldn't be packed inside and that I could get in/out without a parking ticket.  I walked in and found a seat at the bar.  I saddled up to the counter and browsed the menu.  I ended up ordering:  Five Spot Breakfast Sandwich (Eggs, Cheese, Caramelized Onions, Thick Cut Bacon) w/Hash Browns, $5.95 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=BnXYQfUHaR_ajW8_Wy5oUA#BnXYQfUHaR_ajW8_Wy5oUA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/matt...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=Ky1EPe539GhuY-nM_9J5RA#Ky1EPe539GhuY-nM_9J5RA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/matt...</a>  The order came out fast.  I took one bite and loved it.  It was full of flavor...the Caramelized Onions really added to the taste of this Sandwich, I was impressed.  The Bacon tasted great, but was a little undercooked for my tastes...I should've known better and asked for it to be cooked crispy, especially since it was thick-cut...my bad.  It was till a great Sandwich anyway.  Except for the Caramelized Onions, it's exactly how I'd make a breakfast Sandwich.  The Hash Browns were good too, went well with the Sandwich.  The service was great, I was in/out in 30 min....so I had 15 min to spare on the meter.  Lunch menu looks interesting, I'll have to come back and give it a try.  Return Factor - 90%",

You can tell that their coffee was freshly brewed and it came in endless amounts.  There was only a couple issues with this place.

I found out about Matt's while in Phoenix and convinced my sweet boyfriend to take a detour downtown and, yes, wait a while to have breakfast.  It was worth every minute!  The pancakes were absolutely fantastic and I'm the ultimate pancake snob.  They were possibly the best pancakes I've ever eaten.  You could taste the batter.  Don't know how else to describe it.  They were just the freshest most batter-y tasting pancakes I've had in years.  Orgasmically good! I also got a decaf, which was fantastic.  My boyfriend loved his omelette.  Mine was actually just OK, not great, but the pancakes, coffee and service made up for it, 100%.  Our server at the counter was a hoot and although super busy, kept us refilled and entertained.  Real maple syrup.  Yay!",

I had the cheese omelette with some mushrooms and it was delicious, so were the homefries (although a bit too oily, but they tasted great). One of my friends had the steak and eggs and the steak was tender, juicy and tasty! we loved the food and the service from both waitresses that helped us since it was our first time there. Menu could be considered 'small' but you trade that for the quality of food served there. Be prepared to wait for a table though! the place is packed and busy! If your whole party is not there they will not seat you (for obvious reasons). They have a couple of benches outside and some shade from some palo verdes. Parking is free right behind the restaurant, but only a few spots, if you are lucky you can get a spot and don't have to pay for parking. It is downtown Phoenix after all. Only 'bad' thing, which is not a bad thing really, but it may change your mind depending on what you are looking for, the restaurant ambiance was too loud! Since the place is small and packed with people everybody talking (loud in order to hear each other lol). Food was excellent! Service was superb! I highly recommend this place.",

This is why we consult diners drives in and dives everytime we go to a new city. My bf and I were super excited after a positive experience at Chino Bandido (which was also a DDD recommendation).   I will admit that I'm a little biased when it comes to breakfast food (I hate the majority of it) but the Chop and Chick seemed non breakfasty enough for me especially since I got homefries. They didn't know what I meant when I asked for a soft boiled egg so I got my eggs poached. BF got the hog and chick.   We were so disappointed when our meal came out. The portions were normal sized and everything just tasted ok. The sourdough with fresh strawberry preserves was the only special thing about the meal. I wished the sourdough were more sour though. The porkchop didn't have much flavor and was a little tough. My BF felt the same about his order. We walked out feeling like we would've been just as happy going to Dennys (and then I would have had more non breakfast options too!)",

Food was very limited, few egg plates, no flexibility didn't prepare as requested, had to send it bsck, while mine was getting cold trying to be polite and EAT TOGETHER.  We have deleted all reference to this & other MBB establishments, if this is how they hook us it's not worth it.  The food we finally did get wasn't anything special, beats McD, but not byuch except cost, way too oops much.",

    "text": "If you want simple breakfast nailed to perfection, with excellent customer service, I highly recommend this place.  As always, I tried to keep my expectations super low because of the hype, but honestly, it deserves the hype!  It was rainy today so we got an unusual late start on the day. Worked in our favor because there was no wait when we arrived (about 1pm).  Everyone there was super nice. Like, genuinely nice. We ordered coffee and the fresh squeezed honey lemonade. The lemonade was delish! They must put a ton of honey in there because you can really taste the flavor. It's so good. The coffee is great too. It's a special blend made especially for Matt's from Cave Creek roasters.   For food we got the special - 3 egg scramble with andouille sausage and fontina cheese. Omg... Now you can imagine how easily it would be to screw up this dish. But it was not greasy, eggs cooked perfectly, and the HASHBROWNS WERE THE BEST I'VE EVER HAD. No seriously, how do they get those hashbrowns so crunchy?!?! The andouille sausage was nice and spicy. Great dish.  It came with a side of sourdough toast and fresh house made strawberry compote. Soooo good and fresh. Compote not too sweet. Great!  The waffle was light and crispy. Bacon was the real deal y'all. Thick. Crispy. And they have REAL maple syrup.  So...they forgot our waffle and we had to remind them of it. No big deal at all to us. But the way they handled it, they comped the waffle and apologized over and over. Over the top customer service. Over the top.  It really doesn't get any better than this for me. Simple food cooked perfectly and great customer service. And the place is adorable too. Will be back for sure!",

My mom got the skinny, which was egg whites with chicken sausage and spinach, she's all about that stuff so she loved it. My sister and I both got the hog & chick. I got ham which was a thumbs up & sister got bacon. Both delicious. Step dad for the special which was steak and eggs. The steak really impressed me, not only was it cooked perfectly, it was a nice thick piece of meat, they don't cut corners. The toast might have been everyone's favorite part of breakfast, even my carb hating mother. I didn't give 5 stars because I wish they had a bigger menu, just a few more choices!! :)",

There are always so many tourists here, but it is understandable cause the food is great. It was recently my fourth time at Matt's Big Breakfast and I finally got my own plate of waffles instead of eating them off my boyfriend's plate. Best waffles ever and I don't usually go for the sweet breakfast foods.   If you like reubens and it is lunch time here then GET THE REUBEN!! It is so good! The bread that it is on really makes the whole sandwich.   Everyone in Phoenix should try Matt's Big Breakfast at least once.",

Matt what gives,the quality of the food just wasn't what I remember, I can only hope this was a one time thing... don't know what could've happened and you even went up on your prices.",

The time my party and I went wasn't busy the restaurant was not even half way full. Service felt like we were being rushed to order, 3 different people came to our table to wait on us within 5 mins of being sat, silverware was being slammed while sorting in the dinning room I couldn't even hear my conversation at the table, when our food was being ran out the food runner went to the wrong table twice. After five minutes he brought out 2 of 3 plates to our table. Another five minutes go by and the 3rd plate was not out which was a waffle by the way. How is a pork chop and potatoes done before a waffle? As we waited and stared for them to come and even check or let us know that the rest of the food would be out shortly they just looked at us like nothing. We all had high hopes for this place drove from Chandler to downtown Phoenix for a horrible experience.",

I would have loved coffee with my breakfast, but they provide no non-dairy milk or creamer for those of us who are allergic to milk. This always feels a bit offensive to me when businesses don't care, if people are allergic or intolerant to milk. It's pretty common. It's very easy to remedy this slight Matt's.

Generous helpings of home fried potatoes, great pork chops perfectly seasoned with rosemary.   The service here is excellent.  The wait staff is a well oiled machine and they move the waiting crowd in front with very swift precision.

The big pig on the wall with the retro typeface tries to subvert the overwhelming and inescapable airport food court vibe.  The waitress was friendly and the service was prompt.  I ordered a grilled cheese with tomato soup. The cheese was just tasteless and the soup was more salty than if it had come out of a can. I asked for coffee to go and it was barely lukewarm - made me think if the service was really as genuine as you can expect at an airport eatery.  I will remember this place enough to not go there the next time I fly to Vegas through that airport.",

Because they have a paper list and so many waiting guest everyone stands in the lobby blocking the servers from getting around. One girls sole job is to walk around and scream names of people on the list. Inside and outside. Another girl spends half her day explaining to guest that they never quote a time and no the can't just sit at the counter like other restaurants. To many staff not enough system. Counter productive, and un-scale able. Labor cost are prolly killing this place.  Business aside... Food was great and staff is friendly! I'll come back if I have all morning to wait around",

We decided to give the new spot a try and I'm so glad we did! We arrived around 9 on a Sunday, ready to wait. But although the restaurant was full our wait was not long at all! Less than 20 minutes maybe? Although it could be because we were willing to sit at the counter. Whatever, we were happy!  We settled in and opened our menus happy to see old familiar favorites. I ordered the waffle with bacon and my boyfriend got the pancakes. They were every bit as good as we remembered. Huge portions and full of flavor. The pancakes and waffle have almost a sweet flavor to them but they're not sugary. Just right. The bacon is my favorite thing though. Thick, peppery, bacon-y goodness. I'd say it's the best bacon in town.   I'm so happy to have rediscovered Matt's. It's sure to become a regular choice for us once again.",

I know there is usually a long wait, which I was worried about since we havea six month old (teething) baby.  We went prepared to wait.  The wait was not so bad, I think we only waited about 15 minutes.    Once we were seated it did not take that long to order and receive our food.  Everything we had was delicious.  I ordered the griddle cakes, country sausage patties and home fries and my husband ordered that days special.  Everything was flavorful.

I'm not a big lady but the stools were tiny and I kept slipping off the stool.   The staff and service was great.  She was busy however able to fill up my coffee cup without being asked.  I ordered the omelet with cheddar, mushrooms and of course bacon with hash browns and white toast.  Surprisingly the toast and jam, I really enjoyed the most! The omelet was filled with melted cheese, grilled mushrooms and bacon.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and overall the dish was tasty.   Matt's prides itself for making everything from scratch or most of it.  And it is really good, if you are into traditional bacon and egg kind of dishes for breakfast.  The coffee was actually really good and didn't leave a bitter taste.    I would recommend getting there earlier than later due to Matt's reputation in the Valley. The place does get crowded even if it's in a bigger location.   Next time: Waffles!",

So, after a few minutes we decide to sit at the counter, since it was mostly empty.  Our waitress was Briann, who set us up with some coffee almost as we sat down.  Great start!  We ordered the waffles with thick-cut pepper bacon with a couple of spicy sausage patties and some eggs, hashbrowns and bacon.  Everything was very good and as we came to the end of our meal, we noticed the Hostess and told her to take our name off the list for a table.  LOL!  Turns out the list was for the counter as well. D'oh!  Then why were all the seats empty?  Anyway, the rains let up and we were off to the Phoenix Art Museum.  Great way to start a Sunday morning.

I used to be obsessed w the home fries because they used to be so soft and delicious, but now they are pretty much always burnt, crunchy, and oily :/ waffles and pancakes used to have this really delicious home made cinnamon taste, but now they just taste like bisquick mix w cinnamon added. The bacon is pretty good though- thick cut and peppered. everything else on the menu is standard breakfast that you could get from anywhere else. Eggs are ehh. Wouldn't recommend. The service is really quick with greeting you and taking your order initially, but since they don't have assigned tables, it's very hard trying to order something else afterwards. Plus It's always packed like a sardine can. You are maybe 6 inches away from another table, and when they seat 3 people at a table meant for 2 (which they do constantly), it really jams up the restaurant. Never order to-go because they will eff it up. Every time. If you're looking for a quick place to grab food for 2 people or less, then this is okay. Lunch is pretty good. The restaurant is way less busy for lunch and the lunch food is good. Just don't order it to-go.",

What I can remember about this place, very small, limited seating, had to wait outside in the heat. With that said, food was great, service was very good. I had pancakes, OJ, I could remember daughter loved the eggs, bacon, and potatoes. I wife enjoyed the food also. Haven't been back, because how small it is. But as much I am at the airport. I have been to that location a few times.",

    "text": "Great food, we got two pretty basic breakfasts (eggs toast bacon ect) and the huevos rancheros special. They were all really good, especially since they came with a house made jam, cage free eggs, and some locally roasted coffee (cave creek roasters, a great place). The house potatoes had a lot of great flavor, but I personally think they had a little too much Rosemary. That's a personal preference though. The service was good too, the people were friendly and the drink refills were en point. The reason why I give the place 4/5 is because I think he atmosphere was lacking. The place isn't very comfortable. Aluminum chairs are super loud, lighting is very industrial, we could see into the kitchen which wasn't the most pleasant view, and could hear every single thing the servers were talking about from across the room. It wasn't busy either, only one other table, so the sound was ridiculous.",

    "text": "ABSOLUTE WORST SERVICE EVER. Here is the story of our attempt to dine at this restaurant:  We come around 9:40 am and we put our name on the waiting list. There is a large amount of people waiting outside and I ask the man at the front counter if he knew how long the wait is. His reply: \"Yup.\" Silence. I looked at him puzzled and he said \"All your question stated was if I knew the wait time.\" I figured this was his idea of humor and let it slide. I then said \"How long approximately is the wait?\" His reply: \"We don't give wait times, but if I had to guess, maybe 30 minutes?\"   So the boyfriend, a bit bewildered, put our name down and decide to get coffee around the corner at Song Bird Cafe (awesome place, good coffee and FRIENDLY staff, something Matt's Big Breakfast could learn a thing or two from.) We wait about 30 minutes and decide to call the restaurant to make sure they have not called our name. The same man we had originally spoken to answered and when we explained we had gotten coffee around the corner and were just wondering if our names had been called he said, \"I don't know, I gotta go.\" And then he hung up.   So by this time we are very annoyed and walk over. I walk inside and go up to the same man and AGAIN ask if our name has been called and he looks at me and says: \"I don't know, I don't have the list.\" I get upset and tell him he has been rude to us and the restaurant is very unorganized and I didn't appreciate being hung up on minutes earlier. His response? Not an \"I'm sorry\" not a \"what can I do?\" No, his response: \"umm, it didn't happen like that I never hung up on you!\" The man had the nerve to argue with a customer! The whole time we were very polite and not demanding. Needless to say, we took our business elsewhere and went to Postino's and had a lovely brunch.  I have A LOT of family and friends in the area (whom I was visiting) and I have told them all NEVER to come to this place. This place has the attitude that they are too good to even have customer service or even be decent and polite to people. They don't deserve my business and they don't deserve anyone's business until they can change their awful ways. I lived in San Francisco for 7 years and now live in San Diego with amazing food and restaurants; I am sure Matt's Big Breakfast doesn't hold a candle to anything in SF or SD and no restaurant in the former category has ever treated me the way the man did at Matt's Big Breakfast. Save your money and go elsewhere!",

    "text": "***Matt's Big Breakfast is a good, fresh and made-from-scratch breakfast featuring both good sweet items (like French toast and waffles) to high quality breakfast meats (thick-cut bacon and maple sausage links)***  Matt's Big Breakfast was featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins & Drives.  It was in a smaller location back then and had an incredibly long wait.  It is in a much bigger space now though I believe it still has a very long wait; we were able to avoid the long wait though by coming early (a little after 8:00am on a Saturday).  I am not sure what their old space looked like, but the new space is nice.  It has an industrial look and there are great touches throughout the dining room from exposed pipes and a variety of seating to the big blackboard that announces the daily specials.  I had their French toast (which was a special).  It came with maple sausage links.  The French toast was very good.  It was thick toast and the outside was very good.  It had a nice, slightly crispy edge that had great sweetness.  There were great notes of cinnamon and the eggy crust was very addictive.  The inside was fairly moist too without being soggy.  However, because the bread was so thick, the very center of the French toast probably was not as moist as I would have liked.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=6WCwYFxcTuQs-1nZktVsCg#QVj5TsuHRcV3qV5qcpzb5A\">yelp.com/biz_photos/matt...</a>  The French toast came with very good real maple syrup.  Extra maple syrup is available at an extra charge, but the portion they provide complimentary with the French toast and waffles is more than enough in my opinion.  The maple sausages were excellent.  The outside sear was very good and the inside was very juicy.  It had a great mix of salty and then sweet from the maple syrup.  Bob Evans used to do (and maybe still does) maple sausages and Matt's Big Breakfast's sausages were very similar to them though I would say Matt's sausages were thicker.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=6WCwYFxcTuQs-1nZktVsCg#_MwLXLWjCU_o_fZ2Q3JiZg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/matt...</a>  I also tried their waffle and it was very good--nice, thick Belgian waffle that was light and fluffy with the right amount of sweetness.  Their hash browns were good as well--the right mix of soft shredded potatoes as well as a great crispy top.  These hash browns were seasoned just okay; ketchup and hot sauce was necessary.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=6WCwYFxcTuQs-1nZktVsCg#B7lMBvpvsIg5opeOwymeVw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/matt...</a>  I also had their bacon and it was very high quality.  The bacon was incredibly thick.  It was not crispy.  Instead, it was a thick, meaty and chewy bacon (the fat was all rendered down).  The bacon was also heavily peppered.  While the bacon was definitely high quality, I would have preferred a thick bacon that had both a good crispy exterior as well as a meaty, chewy interior.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/matts-big-breakfast-phoenix-2?select=6WCwYFxcTuQs-1nZktVsCg#_3YUclGMUq1-1LN20B1CgQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/matt...</a>  Service was good.  The food came out at a quick pace.  The restaurant gets busy though and it can be difficult at times tracking down a server.  Prices are not that bad.  Some of their items (like their specials and a la carte sides) are definitely on the pricey side, but a lot of their regular menu items feature good portion sizes and are under $8.  Matt's Big Breakfast is a worthwhile breakfast spot and definitely worth visiting if you are a breakfast fan and find yourself in Phoenix.  The food is very straightforward, but It is also immediately recognizable that a lot of the food is homemade/made-from-scratch.  This combined with the high quality ingredients really make this restaurant feel like a very special breakfast place.  I believe this restaurant has its own free parking lot in the back.  Expensive metered street parking is also available.",

    "text": "Matts has one of the best breakfast menus in town and has for many years now.  The original location is by far the best one.  Nothing is really fancy or special but the food is always delicious.  Almost everything is made from scratch and locally sourced.  What is so unbelievable is that there are so many bad breakfast joints out there and all he is doing is fresh, local, and simple food.  Seriously how can nobody do this right out there?  My favorite is the egg benedict but it is only done on Wednesdays.  Pretty much everything on the menu is good but a few of my favorites are the waffle with the perfect mix, salty, savory, fresh, crisp yet fluffy.  Perfection.  Another favorite is the salami scramble.  Schreiner's sausage, eggs, onions, and cheese.  Always solid.  And another one that is really good is the 5 spot which is worth the six bucks.  A huge breakfast sandwich that tastes as good as it looks.  Everything else is just done right: thick crispy peppery bacon, thick sliced bread with homemade jam, fresh squeezed oj, homemade honey lemonade.  You really can't go wrong with anything.  The only thing that keeps me from giving them 5 stars is the service has always been hit or miss.  The first time I went many years ago the waitress was so rude I almost never came back.  The last few times we have been we have had to not only wait for our food but weren't offered refills on our drinks, weren't offered condiments, we finally went to other tables to get them, the food took forever, and the waitresses never bothered to check on us.    Understand-idly this place is packed and always has a line but refills, check ups, and condiments are very basic levels of service and should be part of any dine in experience regardless.  Part of the problem is the waiters don't have assigned tables.  The other part is they need to be trained better.    That aside Matts is still the best breakfast in town rivaled by none.",

Small house filled w lots of small tables. Service is quick and nice. I ordered the waffle which came with 2 thick slices of bacon for about $8. The waffle was yummy. The bacon was thick but way too peppery for my taste.   In my opinion, this is a good breakfast place in the heart of downtown. But nothing crazy special. There's a very small parking right behind the restaurant but it was full when I went on a Thursday morning, so I had to find street/meter parking.

When your response was equally brusque and you again didn't have the courtesy to look at me you weren't only rude, but you minimized a customer, not once but twice. Had I not been with other people I'd have left. Maybe you don't need my business so screw you, too. I won't return.  Not to any of your locations. People like you forget that yelp is our voice.

We were given a 25 minute wait time but were seated much quicker than that.  Cute diner-feeling inside.  Lots of great breakfast and lunch options. Matt's only cooks with real butter and extra virgin olive oil.  They also make their own strawberry preserves.  I had a cheese omelet with mushrooms, extra crispy hash browns and wheat toast with those delish preserves.  We also ordered the Rueben....it came with chips and a homemade pickle.  Everything was really good.  They offer daily specials and a couple homemade lemonades.  This place is definitely worth a visit!",

One is the hyped vegan/paleo fresh squeezed kale juice place that soothes guilty thoughts about enjoyed food by giving you overpriced mush. Next is the trendy place that overcharges you for average food and makes you wonder what all the hype is about    And THEN you hit a place like Matt's and you understand that even the unwashed ignorant masses get something right occasionally.  Matts is a breakfast place, low on ambience and high on service and amazing on food!  Thick cut bacon great eggs and fantastic biscuits and gravy make you glad that you did something right today.  The things that really get you are the great big buttery pieces of toast and killer jam and the epic hash browns.  If anyone has ever written poetry about hash browns, you know where they went to breakfast that morning.  Great place great food, just get there early and on a weekday unless you have literally nothing else to do that day besides stand in line!",

I don't think it was my favorite omelette because the toppings were just stuffed into the plain omelette vs cooked with the eggs but it was still excellent. The waitress was extremely attentive and kept my coffee topped off. I was in town for just the day and glad I stopped off here.",

We'd seen Matt's on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives several times over the years and finally had a good excuse to try it.  This Wednesday morning, there was a bit of a wait, but we had old 7th of time, so we didn't mind.  And we knew that waiting wasn't unusual.  Once we were seated, a server stopped by to take our drink order.  And then a short time later, another server came by to see of we were ready to order.  We'd heard they were 2 servers down, and I'm not sure if this was the system because of that or if this is the norm. Either way, I think it works.  I ordered the honey lemonade and hubby went with coffee.  He requested milk, but tried the coffee without and was immediately impressed.  Said he could probably drink it without cream as the coffee was that good.  (They serve Roastery of Cave Creek.  Guess I have to get some for the house.)  My lemonade was really good too.  It did take a while for food to arrive, but they were busy and I do not mind waiting for food to be done right.  I ordered the French toast with Schreiner's sausage.  It was delicious!  And real Vermont maple syrup!! Hubby had the scramble special with home fries.  He said everything was really good.  It looked it.  I did snag a potato and it was probably the best I've ever had.  Not sure when we'll be able to visit again, but definitely want to.  May have to check out one of their other locations.",

Matt's is like a crowded flight on Southwest Airlines during a busy holiday.  Menu very limited, staff looking to stuff you in the most crowded, uncomfortable space they can find and the noise level...I saw the waiter's lips moving but couldn't hear what he was saying because it's so loud in this place.  It only has around 15 small tables and a bar made for 9 people, but Matt's squeezes in 20. The staff's precision skills are not focused on the customers at hand, but on the next customers that have arrived for the same hastened experience.  This is when they come alive, two to three staff members quickly get the tiny table ready for the next crowd of \"passengers\" looking for a cattle-like experience. The cheese omelette uneventful, the hash browns must have been made a couple of days ago and halfway through my omelette the bottle of hot sauce finally arrived, cap all encrusted with barely two drips left at the bottom of the bottle.  My first thought....Does hot sauce disinfect itself? I don't blame Matt's, I blame myself for coming back to this place.  I'd recommend the farmers market across the street, that's a cool experience.",

    "text": "After consulting Reddit on what I should check out for breakfast, Matt's Big Breakfast seemed to be the resonating winner across different comments and \"Best Of\" lists.  I ordered the hog and the chick and my girlfriend had their Friday scramble. Both sounded promising, but maybe because we aren't breakfast people that it didn't really strike me as anything special.  Overall, my breakfast plate was just mediocre throughout. The bacon was bacon, the eggs were eggs, and the hash browns were just hash browns. You get the idea.  My girlfriend's home fries were good, but someone went HAM on the rosemary. I love rosemary. I use it when I sous-vide my ribeyes, or if I'm reverse searing some ribeyes with butter, but this was just too much. It was overpowering and I couldn't enjoy the potatoes themselves. It tasted like I just ate a sprig of rosemary.  Service was good though and the prices were reasonable. I probably would have enjoyed their lunch items more though.",

The menu was very simple. I really wanted to try their Biscuits and Gravy but they only serve them on Tuesday, I think. Different special every day. I came on the wrong day.   Everything was good. $60 for four people for a 15 minute breakfast seemed high. I understand paying more for better ingredients but dang people, let me enjoy it!!! We were so rushed to eat (pressured to order fast AND received our check after my second bite). I like to sit an enjoy a meal, especially brunch time!!   So great food, but no time to enjoy it.",

    "text": "My sister, a family friend, and I visited Matt's Big Breakfast this afternoon at lunchtime and had a great meal. She opted for a simple eggs and sausage breakfast plate, he had the daily special (a scramble with chicken sausage, potatoes and cheese) and I had the salami scramble. My sister enjoyed her food and she even ate some of the sourdough toast which is a huge deal because she rarely eats bread. It's THAT good! My meal was delicious: the hash browns were crunchy, there was a hefty amount of salami in the scramble, and I, too, enjoyed the toast and House-made strawberry jam that accompanies it.   However, I took away a star because the service wasn't great. Having worked in the food service industry in the past, I know how hard it can be during a lunch rush, and I tried to be understanding. But the seating area at Matt's isn't large and I watched our server stand and do nothing many times while our drinks were only refilled once the entire time we were seated and eating.",

It was mobbed on a Monday morning, but I was alone and they sat me within about five minutes at the breakfast bar. The server there was friendly and fast and helpful. Come to think of it, everyone was friendly and acted like they were glad to have you there even though there were a bazillion people.   I got bacon & eggs with home fries, and seriously, everything was perfect. The bacon is high quality and not over salted. Crispy on the edges, tender in the middle. The home fries were the gold kind of potatoes, the really creamy kind, and they were seasoned with rosemary. The eggs were cooked perfectly and OMG the toast...it was thick slices of homemade wheat bread and homemade blueberry jam.   I really dug the ambiance and it was all I could do not to steal the orange, covered cake stand off the breakfast bar. I wanted it with all my heart and I still have not recovered. The place is done in a very minimal, industrial vibe with pops of bright orange and yellow.   Also, they have a dispenser of ice water outside for the people who are waiting out there which I thought was a nice touch.  Seriously loved this place. LOVED. Hoping I get to go back to Phoenix soon so I can eat there again. And if that cake plate is still there, I hope they've bolted it down. I might not be able to help myself.",

I always take friends from out of state here and introduce them as the establishment with the the thickest slices of bacon you can find in the city. Out of 30+ visits I've never had a bad experience. I recommend getting their daily specials. Their produce is some of the freshest I've had at a local breakfast joint. I think they take advantage of the local farmers market that is hosted by their location althougg I'm not 100 percent on that, but whatever it is, it's awesome.",

The atmosphere is \"hip\" or fresh, but it was loud and echoed. The food came out fast but was just ok. I had the French toast special, which was a bit too thick and rather dry. The apple smoked sausage was ok, but not all that flavorful. The real maple syrup was a nice touch though. I ordered some scramble eggs on the side which were hard/ overcooked. If you like them well done, then the eggs are for you. My wife had their eggs/potatoes/bacon breakfast. The bacon was almost too peppered, and she has a pepper allergy. She said the eggs snd potatoes were ok, but that I make better at home. All this cost us just about $30 before tip which is much pricier that I am used to for breakfast food, and not outstanding enough in taste to justify it. Also to note is that they can't divide checks. My wife needed a separate itemized check as necessary for her company to reimburse her expense and they cannot and will not do that. Apparently it is mentioned somewhere on their menu about that but our 2 minutes to order meant we had to look at the food offerings instead. We have had better experiences at other places nearby and have also received other recommendations for better breakfast food.",

Yes there will be a wait, yes it will be crowded, yes it will be loud and yes the food is amazing and worth all of it. Came here for breakfast on Saturday got in line around 11am got seated right before 12pm. So we ended up have one breakfast dish The Waffle with Bacon and a lunch dish the Butter Burger. There were both delicious. The Waffle is fluffy buttery and fresh the crispy thick cut bacon is salty and balances out the sweetness of the real maple syrup. The butter burger is on point the meat is fresh and cooked to your liking the bun is the icing on the cake it's sweet and tasty. We also had orange juice and when I say orange juice I mean fresh squeezed right into the glass.  It tasted like I had an orange with a straw. The strawberry lemonade was sweet and tangy. The staff was friendly and helpful they took very good care of us. We will definitely be back I hope your enjoy your experience here as much as we did. Thanks for reading. Enjoy!!",

The place is smaller than I thought it would be but they were really efficient in taking orders and getting food out quickly so the turn around was pretty fast.  I ordered the scramble special which included hash browns which were fabulous!  The scramble had jalapenos in it and that in itself made it great! It also came with a tortilla which I filled with my leftovers and had as a snack later that day! Hubby got the pancakes which resembled a double layer cake in height and were light and fluffy he said but I knew he'd be out for the count and not driving anymore after that, there was just too much there for one person and he ate them all! My friend got an omelet with the home fries and toast and everything looked and tasted fabulous. I would certainly not hesitate to stop in here again.",

We keep coming back, if you can get in without waiting an hour it's even better.  A real gem.    Thank you Matt!",

Ordered the Huevos Rancheros but instead brought me the southwest scramble which was scorched and waitress basically dropped it and took off before I could say anything but I didn't want to wait any longer either. Then forget about asking for extra syrup for your pancakes or a side of their green salsa unless you want to pay. They also will not do separate checks even though they're downtown. It's a cool place but feel their attitude is we're so good we don't need your business. Bummer cuz their food is good but customer service is a bit lacking.",

    "text": "I finally had the opportunity to go eat here. The first time I tried was on a weekend and there was a line around the block. This time I went to lunch with some coworkers. It's a small but cozy place. The wait staff was friendly, but when asked to have waters in the larger glasses then what was provided it seemed to start a confusing conversation. In the end larger glass waters were achieved! The food came very quickly. I forgot what it was called in the menu, however I tried their scrambled eggs, country potatoes extra crispy, and it came with thick cut peppered bacon. The eggs were delicious, the bacon was good but at some points seemed almost too thick, and what seems to be the case is  not truly extra crispy potatoes, but they were still very good. My coworkers wanted pancakes, so we ordered their griddle cakes, which came with 3, so we could each have one. I was already full, but that griddle cake was delightful. Overall I definitely recommend this place to anyone who wants a tasty breakfast. It hit all the marks for a nice breakfast for lunch treat! I'll be back.",

    "text": "I guess they just opened a location here at Sky Harbor. I had never been to the original location, so I guess this is a truly objective review.   I'm not from Phoenix; just here for work and decided to have lunch here before my flight back home. But I wasn't that satisfied.   First impressions: great looking menu. I love american breakfast so I was very excited to try it out. I remember seeing the original location on an episode of Triple D as well. Apparently there's always a huge wait at the original location; definitely not the case here. I was seated in 10 seconds. Few reasons include the new location, noobie visitors who have never heard of it, and just the location in general. It's airport food, so you're only going to eat it because it's convenient. I wonder if anyone's ever booked a flight for another airline just because they know MBB is at Terminal 4! Furthermore, there's also a take-out section of the entrance that was completely empty as well.   The service was lacking. Don't get me wrong, the waitresses were very friendly, but they're definitely not on their game. First of all, I was seated at a long counter area that had customers on both sides -- not a problem. Probably could have sat 15 people staggered. Most people are dining alone anyways so no complaints on my end. What made me a little fed up was they seated another man RIGHT in front of me. Mind you, they were NOT busy and the counter is hardly 2 ft wide, so this man was pretty much breathing on my food. If I had leaned in another foot, I could have kissed the guy. I'm sure he wasn't happy either. Dude, stagger your customers if they're dining alone. If all other seats are taken, ask for the permission of both parties. The rest of the counter is empty. Even the guys next to me at their booth were like wtf. C'mon.   Every single person around me was missing something before they even got their food. I didn't receive a straw. My new involuntary best friend in front of me didn't get a napkin or utensils. And the other tables around me didn't get utensils or condiments. Get it together MBB!  Now onto the food. I ordered the Chop & Chick and asked for a waffle instead of toast; didn't mind paying extra. Waffle wasn't bad; tastes like a pretty good waffle I could have made at home. The pork chop and home fries had way too much rosemary. Also, the home fries weren't fries at all, they were just stir fried potatoes, but apparently most people are aware of this so that's my problem. The pork chop was good, a tad but overcooked but the flavor was good. Nothing I'd go out of the way for. and not that juicy either.   When I received my check, I noticed that I was charged for 2 full meals when I simply asked for one replacement item on my meal. They had charged me for a full waffle plate as well as the full chop & chick. The waffle plate comes with bacon ( I didn't receive bacon) and they didn't subtract the toast from my order. The toast wasn't a big deal at all, but the waitress could have told me that they don't have waffles a la carte instead of making me pay for 2 whole meals. This is NOT acceptable.   I was running late for my flight, so I didn't have the time to waive down the waitress. I just paid for the bill and left pretty irked. My meals are covered by the company, so whatever.   Won't be coming back here again. 2 stars.",

The server was very attentive plus there was no waiting in line to get seated. The food was served very promptly while it was still steaming hot. Will definitely return to eat here on our next trip to Phoenix..",

Today it was the omelet with provolone, mushrooms, and sausage.  The sourdough toast was thick, crunchy outside with a chewy inside.

I ordered the omelette with caramelized onions and sweet peppers with one of three cheeses, provolone. It was divine.  Everything I tried was delicious.  The place was packed and we had to wait, but it was worth it.  The service was great, especially sitting at the counter.  They had 5 different lemonades to choose from.  Two styles of potatoes.  I opted for the rosemary home fries and they were incredible.  I tried my partners waffle with real maple syrup and it was also good.  The jam for the bread was not too sweet and when it combines with butter, you have a real winner.  I only wish they had at least one veggie meat option, but other than that it was perfect.  They moved up the street from their old location. The new location is bigger and more modern, but they have an old school vibe, even down to the salt and pepper shaker.  The counter was concrete with a thick clear coat.  The coffee mugs were even cool.  Simply put, they know what they are doing here.  They have two other locations with one being in the Sky Harbor Airport.  I skipped lunch that day and didn't even miss it.",

Our order was 100% correct, which says a lot considering the volume of orders!

Thank goodness theirs was as ours pretty much was just okay. First, the coffee was lukewarm, then when she brought our breakfast my Ma's eggs were cooked scrambled hard (our waitress started to argue with my Ma saying that she had to say she wanted them scrambled soft. Which is unTrue since she's had them cooked regular not soft on other visits to Matt's) and scorched and she was charged for cheese where there wasn't any, her home fries were scorched and hard, both of our toast wasn't toasted just warm bread, we both weren't offered water or given water, my Ma only got a cup and a half of coffee she would have liked another refill with her food but the waitress just looked at our table and walked away, my hash browns were somewhat raw in places, and bacon burnt when I asked for crisp. Then when paying for our bill the waitress brings us someone else credit card and says \"oh, well that's what happens when I run two at the same time.\" How do you get 2 males mixed with 2 women? A different waitress with a smile and happy attitude came and offered coffee but we were already ready to get going so she asked if we needed anything else and brought us to go boxes and a cup of ice. Very nice girls another brought back our card again with a good attitude and smile. Wish we had names to put to their faces because they deserve the acknowledgement for their customer service skills. Not such a great Birthday breakfast as planned for my Ma after all.",

The best trick is to put your name on the list and check on the market on Saturday and then come back.  Food is delicious and the orange juice is amazing.

She was too busy walking back and forth between the kitchen and the take out register for no apparent reason.

You will wait if you have a large party, but I thought it was worth it. Really old brick wall place that has tables and counter service. I had the scramble eggs with bacon, toast, and home fries. The bread and jam are home made! Really good. Bacon was thick cut and had great flavor. No complaints. Everyone enjoyed their meals. I had to finish another one since my wife couldn't.",

We got there about 7:30 and had no trouble getting a seat but by 8:15 or so people waiting in line.  First of all, the waitstaff were fantastic. They must do some sort of \"collaborative\" serving here because it seemed as though every single one of them was taking care of us.  It was not as though they were constantly interrupting our meal to ask us if we needed anything, they were quite simply on top of taking care of our every need regardless of which one of them happened to walk by.  I ordered the eggs Benedict with a side of bacon because that was the Thursday special and it was fantastic. I would definitely come back for breakfast or lunch.",

Sausage links were the maple-rosemary variety, which I found to be unpleasantly sweet and over-seasoned. The home-fries were overcooked and not crispy. Toast consisted of home-made style bread, which is about 1.5 inches thick. Best part was the strawberry jam. And the iced water. It was hot!!",

For Sunday brunchtime, the wait was not too long at approx. 25 minutes. After being seated we were greeted quickly by our server who took and delivered our beverage order. Two people in my party ordered the special and another steak and eggs. The meals were brought out so quickly, it was amazing! They all raved about their dishes. I ordered a waffle with a side of eggs over-medium well which were cooked absolutely perfectly (which happens rarely.) The waffle...oh that waffle!!! It was heaven on a plate! Our server was very personable and kept our beverages filled throughout our meal. A friend had toast with Matt's homemade strawberry jam. Wow!!! Yes...I now have a jar waiting for me in the fridge. So good. Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "Holy freaking deliciousness! My boyfriend and I were spending a few days in Phoenix for a mix of work/fun, and he found this place on Yelp. We waltzed in for breakfast around 10am on a Tuesday and were seated immediately. My first observation about this place was the high energy atmosphere, which made me feel really excited to be there. Noise level was moderate - buzzing with conversation but not noisy, making intimate conversation easy. I also got my coffee immediately, and my request for almond milk in place of regular was accommodated. Always a good start :)  After poring over the variety of unique menu options, my boyfriend ordered the Griddlecakes with a side of Thick Cut Bacon and I went for the Salami Scramble. Griddlecakes were pleasantly fluffy but maintained their flavorful density, and the bacon was coated with a sprinkling of peppery goodness. The Salami Scramble was equally enjoyable - thick cut strips of salty/fatty (that's a good thing) meat distributed throughout a helping of scrambled eggs. Ironically, my FAVORITE thing on the table was the side of potatoes that came with my scramble - thick chunks tossed in a perfect medley of sea salt, olive oil and the FRESHEST rosemary. I typically try to shy away from starchy carbs - not for lack of obsession, but out of consideration for my waistline. These potatoes, however, were irresistible. I literally couldn't stop eating them! My boyfriend seemed to share the same sentiment.   If we ever make it back to Phoenix, I would certainly put this Big Matt's location back on my bucket list for breakfast or lunch.",

Eggs tasted like butter too. The toast was perfect tho, perfect amount of butter. Hubby had country potatoes, which was good. It was chunky enough the butter didn't overwhelm it. His sausage was skinny and almost tasteless too. Hubby said the jelly was good, I got a different taste...a beerish taste. He also said the ketchup was good, I couldn't taste it, the butter on the hashbrown wouldn't let it. I wouldn't go back.",

The staff is super friendly I got to have a little chat with one of the managers (I believe) he was really nice and seemed to very much love his job! Their food is super tasty and pretty affordable too. But heir strawberry jelly my gosh! DELICIOUS! Their menu is sweet and short just how I like it. Honestly I can't stand when places have an encyclopedia of a menu. I will get overwhelmed with all of the options I would probably just walk right out. The deco is really cool pretty industrial. I believe this place was on the food network so that says a lot! Also I recommend coming here early as they do get super packed. I remember trying to get a table on a weekend forget about it! It was an hour wait. I'm sorry you can be the best restaurant in the planet and I will still not wait that long.  However a definite must try!",

There was significant road construction so you couldn't park very close to the place and it was a Thursday morning... and still, when we arrived, the place was packed with a bit of a wait - 5 minutes.  The food was good, I had the breakfast sandwich and we ordered the special eggs benedict as well as a waffle to share... all of it was really good!  The service was fast and attentive... and even though the place was busy the food came up quickly.  This place has had quite a local reputation... and I have to say if you're in the area and would like to get some breakfast - definitely try this place out.",

I had been wanting to check this place out for a while and was really excited about trying the French toast special. When I asked to swap out the meat for a non-meat side, they wouldn't let me (even after I told them I was a vegetarian and was willing to pay full price). The manager tried to explain why they can't do substitutes, but her explanation made no sense...it was something about having just the right amount of ingredients for the specials. (Swapping out would have left them with EXTRA ingredients for the special, not less). So I left. The whole experience was a bummer; I had already ordered a coffee and felt obligated to pay for that. I had already paid for parking too. Not planning to go back.",

The sausage in the biscuit and gravy has MSG which makes your whole mouth and lips feel like there is a party going on. Not great for people who it affects negatively. They should really disclose this, especially since they are so proud to advertise that they use real butter and extra virgin olive oil.  My spouse had the ham and cheese omelette, and he said there was a lot of chewy fatty ham. He said it was a little bland for his liking.  Also had the blueberry lemonade at the waitresses recommendation, it pretty good, very sweet, I couldn't finish it.  The rosemary potatoes were delicious, but probably not good enough for us to come back during our stay.   Good: -Ambiance -Price -Speed -Rosemary Potatoes  Could Use Improvement -Stop using sausage with MSG -Use less sugar in the Lemonade -Get more creative with spicing up other dishes",

That being said, I went to Matt's with high expectations and they exceeded them. I think a lot of breakfast is bland and similar to other places, but not Matt's.   Sure, it's busy all the time...that's because it's good. Sure, it's loud...that's because it's busy. Service is good. I love sitting at the breakfast bar because the service is even better.   My favorite dish is the salami scramble with added jalapenos. Waffle is the best I've tasted. Hash browns are up there with the best i've tasted. Hell, even their jelly is better. I've been here about 10 times and never left dissatisfied. Only tip would be to get there early. After about 8:30 it really starts to pick up, at least on the weekends.",

At first I have to admit I thought that this just might be a lot of hype.  Just another downtown hipster joint with over priced food.  Man I was way off when I saw the menu and eventually received our food.  I ordered the breakfast sandwich and the wife ordered the waffle and bacon.  Man both were really really good.  The bun for the sandwich tasted like it was freshly made, and the bacon was great.  I ordered it without onions, and sadly didn't order the home fries so I'll try that next time.  I tasted the waffle and it was fantastic along with the thick cut bacon.  The syrup was very tasty and real butter was a nice touch.  Even their coffee was good.  We had great service and were lucky enough to get seated right away.  I really enjoyed our breakfast and for 2 it was right around $20 bucks.  I'm not a real big fan of eating out for breakfast so for me to give a breakfast place a high rating is something to say.  I'm glad I finally tried out Matt's.",

I may be a bit biased because breakfast food is my favorite food, but I was super impressed with the quality of the food and the culture Matt's propagates. I felt like a super nerd for eating alone amongst groups of families and friends, but the servers made me feel like a priority. In addition to my waiter, I had several other employees fill my coffee cup and water when they passed my table. It's rare to find a restaurant where the servers watch out for each other, and put the customer first, regardless of whose table they're at.",

    "text": "Our experience was disappointing from the very beginning. After waiting for over 30 minutes, which we were fine with, they proceeded to seat another couple who signed in after us. I brought it to the hosts attention, no big deal, they got us another table. We sat down, and the host rudely came back over to us and told us to sign in next time, which we had done, they just skipped over us. Them missing us wasn't a big deal, his attitude when he approached us was a huge turnoff. Whatever. We were ready for this awesome breakfast after reading all of the reviews. I got a waffle and bacon. The waffle tasted the same as any other regular waffle on planet earth, the bacon was good. That together was $7.95, at least throw an egg or two in there! They also give you 2oz of syrup, which was enough for my one waffle but not enough for my husband's 3 pancakes (no one likes choking on a pancake). It was $1.50 for an additional 2oz of syrup, which I find absolutely ridiculous. Again, the pancakes tasted just like any regular pancakes. My husband sat with no refill of his water for over ten minutes before I had to get up and ask for it to be refilled.   Overall, we were unimpressed with the service and food.   We did eat breakfast at Vovomeenas on our visit and it was phenomenal from start to finish and reasonably prices. I would take their breakfast ten times over Matt's big breakfast, no questions asked (get the BMOC!)",

The fresh baked bread & preserves are awesome!  Dislikes.....  My eggs were anything but over medium.  (Super runny)  My home style potatoes were raw. At lest 3/4 of them were not cooked an not edible. :(  My husbands sausage patties were still visibly pink in the middle. (Not anything that's gonna kill ya, but IMO pork sausage should be cooked thoroughly.)  I really think you guys have a great place, I just think  maybe the cooks need to slow down a bit & get the food  cooked properly. Obviously, the place is normally packed w/ people waiting & I am sure that puts a lot  of pressure on everyone. Sometimes you have to take a  step back to take a step forward.",

We arrived at 9:30am on a weekday and waited about 30 minutes to be seated (party of four). The service was excellent and everyone in my group enjoyed what they ordered. I had \"the chop and chick\" which was two eggs, a pork chop, country potatoes and toast. They make their strawberry jam from scratch which was really good. I would definitely go back if I'm in the area again.",

The restaurant is darling with exposed brick and utilitarian pendants. They moved down a block last year to accommodate the crowds.   We sat at the breakfast bar and enjoyed a fabulous breakfast. I had a cheddar omelet with mushrooms and sourdough bread. The former was cheesy and exceptional The toast was served with marvelous fresh apricot preserves. My dining mate raved about his home fries (with fresh rosemary) and the special which was a ham scramble with fresh jalapenos. Both were winner choices.     Our server was really efficient and rather mesmerizing to see her take care of dozens of people with apparent ease. Watching her whisk around, felt like I was watching a lava lamp while waiting for breakfast, I am dinging a star because the place is really loud. Also my bottom kept sliding off the half dollar size bar stools. Noticed the ASU kids didn't seem to have that problem.     We will definitely return.  Thanks Yelpers",

    "text": "I've been coming to Matt's since it was in the tiny hole in the wall place down the road from it's new location and I have never been let down.  Their menu is fairly small but their portions are gigantic. Just the waffle alone takes up a whole dinner plate, and their omelets are to die for. Literally the first bite always brings a tear to my eye. I always go for the ham, red pepper, and American cheese which just oozes cheese and its innerds with each bite. Their bacon is also soo good, thick cut and well seasoned. They sautee their onions in some delicious oil that I have yet to place but always tastes fantastic. And their lemonade is the perfect mix of sweet and tart, and made fresh daily with real cane sugar and comes with fruit options as well. And each breakfast comes with your choice of bread (sourdough, wheat, white, and occasionally other options) and a side of freshly made jam of the day which is always incredible. I go for their sourdough which is always wonderful but their wheat is just as good.  The only thing I have found lacking is the hash browns, some days they are great but more often than not the bottom half is under cooked and soggy, get the home fries which come with sauteed onions and a sprinkling of fresh rosemary (they are sooo good).  Its family owned and Matt (the owner) gets all of his ingedients fresh from the local farmer's market. It wasnt uncommon in the past to see him helping out tables at the old restaurant but now with the new locations, he's more busy making sure each location is as good as the original.  Parking can be a bit difficult but their is an ally that connects the new restaurant with the old which allows more parking. And their is often a wait if you come before noon, but trust me it is well worth the wait. This is by far the best breakfast joint in town.  I would recommend this place to anyone, whether you just picked up friends or reletives from the airport or if you're just looking for a good hearty breakfast. It can get loud and it is a bit longer wait for large groups (come after 1pm and you won't have a problem) but everyone will thank you for the amazing meal. I seriously suggest this place to everyone I know and everyone says its the best. Whether you stumble in after a long night drinking (they open at 6am and the food is just as good then) or if you're grabbing a bite before starting your day everything here is incredible.   And hey now there's an airport location with a full bar, which I've heard has the best bloody Mary's. The other locations definitely don't match up with the original though so try the place where it all started first.",

It was quite busy for a Friday morning at like 9am (don't people have work?!) but we were seated within 10 minutes. I ended up ordering the cheese omelet and added bacon. This also came with toast on the side, of which I ordered wheat. Yeah ok, this was literally a big breakfast. My plate was FULL with home fries (seasoned with rosemary yum) and my omelette took up more than half the plate. The pieces of toast were massive, yet the perfect level of toasted. Not crispy, nor soft. Perfection. Everything was delicious. I left feeling satisfied and full. Also, our server was super friendly, and was on top of refilling our coffees, as we were all suffering from sleep deprivation.",

Their bacon is also excellent - peppered and cut thick.  All in all, MBB is a great find for a tasty breakfast. Be sure to check out their location in the Phoenix airport as well!",

It was super tasty but not sure it was $4 good. My husband loved the daily special and they have made in house hot sauce which was also good and he said had a slow heat. Bacon was thick cut and fully cooked but not burnt which isn't easy to do. The service was ok. It took a bit from when we were seated to when someone asked about our drink order and a time or two we had to flag someone down for more coffee or water. Overall it was a good experience and I'd go back but the 4 stars is due to the service.",

Now, confession time: as much as I tell myself I'm going to change it up, I always revert to ordering the same thing: the Hog and Chick. My order comes with: Scrambled eggs: I'm not usually a fan of eggs at restaurants, but Matt's use of butter makes their eggs fluffy and absolutely delectable, almost reminiscent of homestyle soft-scrambled eggs. Bacon: Thick-sliced bacon. Need I say more? Those three peppery, perfectly cooked slices are what every pig aspires to end up as and my favorite part of this dish, hands down. Home fries: When given the choice between hash browns and home fries, I will always opt for home fries. Matt's home fries are what I would call skillet potatoes. They're crispy and super flavorful, cooked with onions and rosemary. Dip in some of Matt's special ketchup for a sweet and savory match made in heaven. Toast: Thick buttered slices every time. Served with their yummy preserves. The strawberry preserves are my favorite. It's a busy, bustling atmosphere, a nice kind of energy to start your day. If you have the time and patience, do yourself a favor and stop by! :)",

Adam is my server and he is friendly, knowledgeable and on top of it. Here is the surprise for me and why it was so easy for me to give 5 stars. Typically the god I get from breakfast restaurants when they first open is undercooked and pale hash browns and  bacon that is not crisp.

Fast forward 10 more minutes and you seat a couple who came in AFTER me at the table that's been open for 20 minutes! How COMICAL!  So then when you want to try to be nice after the fact you realize you've pissed me off.  So when I tell you to leave me alone you want to tell me I need a better attitude?! lol you're a host who can't manage their job tasks. You're not a life coach so you can F off.

    "text": "This Matt's 'Big' Breakfast location is actually very small, and loud.  But the service is very good, a bit chaotic but friendly.  The average breakfast of eggs, bacon, sausage is nothing special (but bacon and toast are thicker).  If that's all you're interested in, you might get a better deal at a Denny's or IHOP that's less crowded.  However, if you go for their more interesting dishes, that's where Matt's shines. People really like the french toast and pan cakes with REAL maple syrup, large hash-brown portions, beautiful omelettes, homemade preserves and more.  Matt's was also featured on 'Diners, Drive-ins and Dives'",

Went on a Sunday morning around 10am expecting a wait and didn't wait longer than 5 minutes, I think the horrendous construction might be keeping people away.   The flavors in my Saturday Special three egg scramble with Cabot cheddar, sauteed jalapenos, and Shreiner's chicken enchilada sausage were bursting. The jalapenos had great heat. The hash browns come in a slab with the perfect ratio of crispy top and bottom to a soft, almost creamy center. Then, as if you needed some more carbs, they throw a large tortilla on top of it all. My scramble plate and his waffle were easily shared with two of us- we both left stuffed. $27 including coffee.   Coffee- great! Waffles- light, fluffy, savory, and slightly sweet, served with real maple syrup.  The incredible bacon like they serve you reminds you not all bacon is created equal. Service- fast and friendly.   We have so much more to explore on the menu. Can't get back soon enough.",

The English toast that the poach egg and ham sits on isn't my favorite and the hollandaise sauce wasn't a wow for me.

A lot of reviewers mention friendly staff but we didn't get that warm, happy and welcoming vibe. Host was a gentlemen and he wasn't rude but was running around the place and just quickly took your name (appreciate that his a fast and hard worker but a quick hello and letting us know how long wait wouldn't hurt). Our server wasn't rude but also did her job, hello. Took our order. Checked back. Drop check. Nothing engaging to remember or make the visit better. When dropping off a check, one should let the guest know when your ready to pay, you can take it to the encounter. Don't assume everyone is from that town...",

    "text": "Matt's Big Breakfast is located in a little building on the corner of 1st Street and Garfield. It is always packed and if you don't arrive before roughly 9AM you will wait for a table. Luckily we were able to get the last table on a recent Saturday. It is at this moment that our luck ran out.  I have said this before: there are only a handful of breakfast spots in downtown Phoenix so to hear people tell it, this is the greatest breakfast place in the world. However, this analysis is False, the breakfast is average at best and is elevated in lieu of other options.   There is parking located behind the building and all along the streets. At various times a song would come on the speakers inside and drown out the chatter, and then silence for 10 minutes. Maybe we came on an off day.  Perhaps someone can help me with something, I ordered the hash browns and they tasted as if they were smothered in vanilla or something sweet. This was immediately off-putting and I could not tell if this was intended but it ruined the whole experience. I did like the jam they served with the sourdough toast, it was probably the best part of the meal.  Ordinarily I would ask a server about this strange flavor choice for the hash browns but it was so incredibly busy that waiting 10 minutes for a water refill seemed to signal to me that I should just move on with my day.  I tried the salami scramble and there massive chunks of sopressata haphazardly tossed in a mountain of eggs. It came with potatoes on the side, they were tasteless and I couldn't finish them.   I may return to try their lunch menu at some point but I will not eat breakfast here again unless forced to.",

We both got a side of sausage and a Strawberry Honey Lemonade.   It arrived in about 10 mins. The eggs were nicely cooked and the potatoes were cooked crispy, just as I prefer them. The sausage were a bit small for the price but I got full anyway. The drink was too sweet and would've been better without the honey.    Overall a good experience.

    "text": "Went to Matt's Big Breakfast with 6 of my peers after an informational session on a Saturday afternoon. It was very busy, there was at least a 30 minute waiting period, and we had to wait for all the members of our group to be present before our waiting period even began.  Even though we ended up waiting for a little over 30 minutes, it was well worth the wait because we got to sit at this big table located in a little room they have off to the side. It made the setting very intimate and homey since we were surrounded by cute decor and a refrigerator holding Matt's homemade preserves.   The first time I ever went to Matt's Big Breakfast I was really craving egg salad so I ordered the egg salad sandwich, which even though it was good, it wasn't anything I would return back for. With that in mind, this time I decided to order something Matt's Big Breakfast is known for, that being BREAKFAST! I ordered the special of the day, the egg scramble complete with local cheese, spinach, and sausage. Between the hashbrowns or home fries I ordered the home fries  (basically quartered potatoes, crisped to perfection and seasoned with rosemary, YUM). The scramble came with a side of toast with butter and a little cup of their famous preserves. I ordered sourdough toast and the preserves that it came with were strawberry. Their preserves are definitely worth a try! Not to be confused with jelly, their preserves have a nice consistency with bits of fruit noted.  I would not recommend dining here if you have big groups in which the check needs to be split. I say this because if we wanted the receipt split according to what everyone ate, we had to take it up to the counter where we were informed by the cashier that she was unable to split it by item, we had to give her dollar amounts. This got a little tricky since the receipt wasn't itemized but rather grouped into by item (i.e. 3 hog and chick's were ordered and the receipt only showed the total for all three). Additionally, we didn't have menus in front of us to determine the individual item prices and our group was fairly large which made standing at the cashier doing math quite the inconvenience for anyone in line behind us.  It mostly seemed like there were families and parties of one here at Matt's Big Breakfast so definitely go solo or with your family.  I would definitely recommend Matt's Big Breakfast if you're looking for homey breakfast food with subtle modern nuances.",

Had very thick slices of bacon. I also received the wrong toast with my order which I'm not that mad about, it is understandable for a mistake to happen with how crazy busy it was. My waitress however was very rude. We asked a question about what type of toast they had when we ordered she rolled her eyes and was very snarky. If I had not had that experience with the waitress the place would definitely have an additional one or two stars.",

I was feeding him gold fish when a waitress came up to me to inform me that I can't bring outside food in. His sippy cup was allowed but that's it. Are you serious? I didn't bring Taco Bell in. I brought in gold fish for my toddler who would, if I let him, cause mass destruction just by running around. It was ridiculous.   The food was good but to be informed I can't give my toddler snacks from home inside, it gives me a reason not to come back. I know, I know most people wouldn't see this as a problem but if you can't accommodate my child, no reason to come back.",

I prefer to keep an eye out for the limited waiting area seating inside, though!!  While waiting, people forget the seats inside free up as those people are call to their tables.  Staff is very efficient, yet still personable to their customers.  On our last visit I loved how the hostess called me by name when she came by to check on my table.  And you don't just have one person checking up on you.  They all do!    Now, on to the food.  There is a reason why Matt's Big Breakfast is iconic here in Phoenix.  It's delicious!  The menu is simple and straight forward, but anything you order is phenomenal.  And although you've had a version of everything on the menu before, the way Matt's make it is so much better!  They also have specials so even if you visit more than a few times you can still try something a little different on each visit.",

You're better off driving to Arcadia area where thwy have several restaurants with the same kind of ambience, price, bigger portiins and free parking. Also, if you're a breakfast place in AZ that serves eggs and don't carry Chaloula that's just blasphemy. The service was good, their definitely quick. Although, they forgot our sausages by the time it came out we were done with everything else. But that happens sometimes, I'm sure they were just busy. The decor is cute.",

Unfortunately the worst part was when we got to the counter and asked for our bills to be separated due to Meals being granted by my work the server said he is unable to do that and has never had to do that.

We hit the 1st street location on a Monday morning, 8:30 am, and apparently beat the rush - as a party of two, we were seated immediately, but as we ate we watched with some surprise as pretty large groups kept coming in and were willing to wait for quite awhile - can they not tell it's a tiny location with primarily tables for two? As for the food, my tomatillo/eggs/tortilla/pinto beans were pretty good, though not the unforgettable experience I'd expected, judging by the other Yelp reviews which guided us here in the first place. My husband outright hated his eggs & salami scramble, describing the salami as 'rancid.' But honestly, eggs and salami together sounds awful anyway, so perhaps he should have played it safe and gotten a classic eggs & bacon option. Coffee refills slowed down as the place became more and more busy.  Anyway. We're glad we tried it as it filled us up for several hours, and it didn't break the bank.",

It seems like everyone on this thread is already raving about this place, so I guess I'm just going to add more to it!  Yes, it's busy. So be prepared to wait for a table. Wife, her mom, and I waited for about half an hour for a table. But that was okay.   It's very simple, clean inside the restaurant. Their food portions were big and plenty.   Their country potatoes are stellar and so is their bacon. Eggs are eggs anywhere. It seems a lot of people liked the orange juice here, but I didn't try it.   Their coffee was great though! The server was very nice. But when we asked her about a few of the entrees, she wasn't very helpful because she said she didn't eat meat.   I think that's part of the reason I chose a more traditional breakfast. Eggs, bacon, potatoes and toast.   It was good though!",

Their hashbrowns (and probably everything else on the menu) probably have three tablespoons of butter in them, but trust me its worth it. There is usually a wait, so be prepared. But just do what we do and go there anticipating an hour wait, not when you're starving. Sip some cave creek coffee and enjoy the day while you wait. You'll be glad you did!",

They do good, old-fashioned comfort breakfast food and they do it well. They also use local and organic ingredients and cage-free eggs.   I don't remember what my friends had as we ate there awhile ago, but I had the Hog & Chick. Bacon was crisp but not overcooked and was delicious! Eggs were cooked perfectly as well and the potatoes were crisp and perfectly seasoned.    Once you get seated you are well taken care of by friendly and knowledgeable waitstaff who are more than happy to help you decide if you're having a hard time, which is understandable given the variety of tasty options on the menu. They keep coffee and drinks topped off and make sure everything is cooked as it should be.   I have not had any of their lunch items yet but if they're anything like their breakfast menu they are sure to be phenomenal.   Definitely plan on going back now that I have most weekends off!",

I met up with a couple of friends yesterday for brunch. There was a line when we arrived and I think we ended up waiting about 30 minutes, which was fine and expected, we used the time to catch up. We were seated in the little semi-private room right up front where an old skillet is - very cute. The menu is diverse but isn't huge. Two of my friends got two of the breakfast items I was eyeing and said I could try some, so I got the Big Butter Burger and Honey Lemonade. The honey lemonade is amazing. Something you could definitely make at home but I did not mind paying for that sweet sweet juice. The burger was very good, not extraordinary. I thought I would be fine with the kettle chips but I wish I had gotten coleslaw instead. What blew my mind though was the griddlecakes. OH the griddlecakes. Honestly. So good. And the bacon. Fantastic. Their lunch is good but they serve breakfast all day so just go and eat griddlecakes and bacon.",

I wouldn't do this for TJ's out on Avondale south of Van Buren which is truly great!!!  If you're on the West Side, go to TJ's.  If you're on the East Side, try Mircle Mile on the the weekends for breakfast or the Bisbee Cafe on Dobson and Guadalupe.    This place is way the hexx overrated..",

Portions were large, expect to take home leftovers unless you arrive with a hungry man appetite :) the only bad thing I can comment on is the wait.

The toast was very good, but only one piece (thick toast).  Now for the bad. The bacon was not even close to being cooked (half raw) and I sent it back. By the time the bacon came back I was basically done with the other food. The worst part was the amount of oil in my plate. It had to be almost an 1/8 of a cup of oil.  I am not a health nut I have eaten at plenty of greasy spoon restaurants and would gladly go back to a few....... but this was ridiculous.  I mentioned this was my first visit when I ordered and as I was paying the waitress asked how my breakfast was. I told her \"I have never seen that much oil on a plate and as you know they bacon was almost raw\" .......  her reply was at least it is olive oil.",

    "text": "I have had a love/hate relationship with Matt's, but in the past couple of months since they changed locations it has definitely been on the love side! I have gone to the new location a couple times and I think I have figured out the 'secret' to eating here. I live about 3 blocks away from Matt's so when I want to go I get up super early and arrive no later than 7:30. This generally ensures that I do not have to wait. Then, I order either the griddle cakes or the waffle, with the waffle being the better choice. The waffle is light, yet obviously bad for you because it tastes sooo good. Unlike the griddle cakes, the portion isn't crazy over the top and it comes with bacon which I like to tear into small pieces and put a piece in each of the little waffle pockets (or indentations or whatever those things are called). This plus the real maple syrup and butter is a sick....deliciously sick....combo. The griddle cakes are still awesome...like I said before, they taste like pancakes your grandma would make if your grandma was a really awesome cook. Also, the coffee no longer tastes like metal, it is, in fact, quite enjoyable. All in all, this place is good, especially when you don't have to wait.",

    "text": "If you like breakfast, and you want to flavorgasms as you eat, this is the place for you. I got the salami scramble which is three scrambled eggs with molinari sopressata salami, and I got the side of hash browns and toast. (Potato side and toast comes with all egg meals) I never would have thought of salami in the eggs, but it was the perfect complement with the peppery taste it packed. That being said, the eggs themselves were extremely tasty and could have been eaten plain. Coffee was hot, fresh and taste good. The toast was Texas sized toast and they had quite possibly the best strawberry preserves I've had in years, if not ever. Service was fantastic; my only negative that is keeping this from being 5 stars is the hash browns.  I'm not complaining about them, but they weren't on par with the great quality of everything else at Matt's. I highly recommend this place, but the wait can be long depending what day and time you get there (this place is loved by the locals) we got there at 815am on a Sunday and were seated immediately (the last available table)",

    "text": "Good food and good service.  I really like the food and I've been here two times with a friend who referred me, and once on my own.  They have home-made bread and jam, and good food overall with good portions.  Daily specials will change frequently over a morning or afternoon, and the specials are good--unique.  Now for why I didn't get it all 5 stars:  It's pretty busy all the time, which means packed, which means you probably will have to wait.  That's the mark of a good restaurant, and they are quite efficient at getting people in and out, and served efficiently.  You will usually have to wait in a line to pay, but often the wait staff will take it up for you.  Tables are very close together and you are right on top of your neighboring diners.  Most of all, it's so noisy you can hardly hear yourself and your tablemate talk.  If you are by yourself, you will be put at the counter, period.  They rightfully maximize space. The environment is a little overwhelming.  But the service and food are good.  One a single one-room bathroom is inside each for the Guys & Gals, and there was a line each of my visits.  Even if you are not waiting, if other people are in line, they can be right in front of your table where you're eating.  It's a small place that is open for breakfast and lunch and does a booming business.  I've only been here for breakfast and I would go back with my friend.",

I gave two stars instead of one because someone (manager?) did come to the table and tried to assist, but there's only so much you can do when every food item received was unacceptable.

Not to mention the REAL fresh squeezed orange juice.   Servers are hit or miss. Last visit I had a gal completely forget to put our order in for about 20 minutes, but the kitchen is fast so it wasn't more than 15 minutes after she did that we had our food.   No real complaints, Matt's food is worth the wait!",

    "text": "**Disclaimer: this post is long.  For a summary/breakdown of my rating, scroll to the bottom.  Let me begin by saying that if I could award this establishment 0 stars, I would have. I visited Matt's for the first time yesterday morning with a few of my coworkers.  I was told great things about this restaurant and was excited to try it out.  I ordered their special which was an egg and cheese scramble with pepper jack cheese, pork tenderloin, and roasted green chilies; it came with choice of hash browns or diced potatoes and a flour tortilla.  A friend told me they had great diced potatoes so I went with it. Wrong choice. I love potatoes, I love flavor, but there is such thing as over seasoning, and Matt's perfected the act.  I took a bite of the potatoes first, before trying anything else, before adding anything to flavor my food, and was blown away by the amount of rosemary.  I assumed it was just a fluke, nope. Tried another potato and it was just as bad.  You couldn't taste the potato at all!  Just seasonings.  I doused them in ketchup and still couldn't choke them down. The scramble was decent, nothing spectacular, nothing awful. The flour tortilla was terrible.  I assumed they were homemade, since Matt's boasts about all their natural, non-gmo, freshly this-and-that food.  The only way to describe the flavor was salt dough, the kind you have a five year old put their hand in to create a Christmas ornament... Yuck!  I asked for some butter, which came with a side of judgement that I will get to in a moment, to put on my tortilla but it didn't help at all, I gave up on it and tossed it down on my plate next to my unfinished rosemary...I mean potatoes. I also had a \"large\" glass of fresh squeezed orange juice.  It tasted good, but silly me, I didn't think to check the price before I ordered it.  $4.50 for a large glass that was /maybe/ 16oz.  I get that they offer freshness where most do not, but get a grip!  I know this issue was my own fault, it could have been avoided if I had just glanced at the price.  The juice is not factored into their low rating.  Let's discuss the service!  Since it was a late, weekday morning, I didn't anticipate much of a crowd, and to my relief, there wasn't one, so we were seated rather quickly.  Someone promptly brought us water and took our drink orders, then made several trips to bring us our drinks (there were only 5 of us).  Whatever, we got over it.  Then we went to order and discovered that substitutions are not made, even for those with food allergies and intolerances.  Because that's fair, right?  We didn't have to wait long for our food to come out, which was nice, but then the service fell flat, like their job was done, time to move on to the new paying customers (not that there were a whole lot of them).  A completely new waitress came and asked as we were finishing up how things were, which was when I asked for a side of butter.  She looked at my plate as if to see what I could possibly need butter for, as if it was any of her business.  Got the butter, it didn't help make my tortilla taste better, then they dropped the check off (I had inquired about separate checks when we were ordering...they don't do that here).  This may just be my own issue, but I feel that we shouldn't have to ask the waitress to refill our water, yet I did.  It's called being attentive in your customer service.  The vibe that this place put off was just plain snobbish.  I stem from Southern California, where restaurants with natural, non-gmo dishes are a dime a dozen, and they don't serve up near as much of a pretentious attitude as this small diner in downtown Phoenix.  Honestly this place needs a huge reality check.  Rating summary:  Customer service: 0/5 stars for being completely unaccommodating Food quality (taste): 1/5 stars because natural food should not taste this bad... Prices: 2/5 stars because I understand that natural food is not always cheap, but that doesn't mean gouge your customers. Atmosphere: 0/5 stars; over-priced, penny-pinching and pretentious do not make for a good restaurant vibe.  Overall: terribly overrated.  Do yourself a favor and make your own natural breakfast at home; it'll taste better, save you money, and the service you'd get couldn't be any worse than what you'd receive at Matt's.",

To my delight it was served with homemade kettle chips and a pickle that was pure pregnancy heaven.  I asked for another pickle and to my surprise three more were served up on a plate pro bono.  Seriously this is no Vlasic, this is some a-grade zmyology.  The kiddie meal of an egg, two pieces of the same high quality bacon, and hand-cut thick fries were a steal.  I was tempted to order a hand squeezed honey lemonade or a hand squeezed oj but I stuck with water.  They even had a high chair.  The food here is prepared with quality ingredients.  For example they make their own corned beef versus cheap-o deli meat. This ain't yo average airport fare.",

It is larger, thank Gawd! but not much, thank Gawd again. That was part of the charm. Go on a weekday, when you have the day off and it wont be crowded. Being a sucker and going on Saturday at 9:45am is surely going to cause you to wait in line. Thats rookie business.   But the new location, is still small enough to keep its charm and unique, downtown, local vibe but large enough to not have to pull tables together for a 4 top!   Their food, menu, daily specials, and coffee all still consistent and amazing as always.",

The hash browns looked fine, perfectly golden on the top, exactly the way I prefer it.  However, I'm pretty sure there weren't the additional flavorings like the rosemary and onions in that~!  The home fries had great flavor AND they cooked crispy on at least one of the sides of each piece.  Absolutely one of the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had.  I got the special of the day which was 3 eggs scrambled with ham off the bone, anaheim chili peppers, and cheese with a side of tortilla.  It was delicious.  Good char on the tortilla too.  It was very slightly underdone, but I actually prefer that over the risk of overdone eggs.  I guess the one thing that detracted from the place was the limited menu.  They don't really serve any alcoholic beverages (which is actually a bit refreshing), and some common breakfast items are not on the menu (ie biscuits and gravy, french toast).  But hey, if I can pick anything off their menu and it will be equally delicious, I would always come back!",

    "text": "I always thought I would never write a review and post it. To me the option of others regarding an establishment is moot, we all have things we value over other things when to it comes an establishment. However the one thing EVERYONE can agree on is getting what we asked for in a timely manner. That brings me to this review about Matt's Big Breakfast.  I have wanted to try Matt's Big Breakfast for a while now. I know there is usually a decent wait to get a table, but I had a foodie friend in town from NYC and thought she is the perfect person to go with me. We got there on Monday after the Super Bowl at around 11am... as I thought we were on a wait, 30 minutes, not bad.  They called our names and we sat right by the door at the bar that looks outside to the street. Our server was fast to come to us and take our drink order. Our Strawberry Honey Lemonades arrived and she took our order and went to put them in. Now it doesn't really matter what we ordered but I will tell you anyway; The Hog and Chick, with a side pancake and the daily special (omelet of some sort) with a side pancake.  After about 10 minutes The Hog and Chick plate arrived, 3 minutes later both side pancakes arrived, 2 minutes later the bill arrived. When the server came back I told her our whole order had not come out. She said oh yeah you didn't get your toast, she leaves before I could say anything. She brings back a side of toast and I said the other dish, the daily special didn't come out yet. She goes back brings more toast and says she put in the daily special. 5 more minutes go by and the same server takes away my plates (yes I ate, I was starving) and she asked did we get the bill. I tell her yes, but we still are waiting for my friends order. 5 more minutes go by and I go to pay. I told the manager behind the counter about our missing meal, so it could be removed from the bill. The manager asked if I had told the server we didn't get our entire meal... yes I told her. The manager just seemed more concerned that she pointed out the error of the server, because she asked me this question 2 or 3 times. The manager then asks the kitchen, the kitchen didn't know anything about a daily special on that ticket or about having one told to them 5 minutes ago about it being done on the fly.   The manager removes the meal; just the daily special and I pay for the rest. The manager says they will get the daily special out for us right away. I tell her I am done, my friend doesn't want it and we are leaving so there is no point. The manager insisted that we wait and take it, okay I think she is trying to make it up to us... we will wait. So 5 more minutes go by and I see a bag up in the window, a few more minutes go by (as it sat in the window) and I tell my starving friend let's go. As we are getting up to leave a server runs over and says \"here is your to-go order\" TO GO ORDER! That is funny!! I ask for the manager and she said \"you already spoke to her.\"   I was not happy that the manager didn't deliver it herself and apologize to my friend, I was not happy that my friend now had a horrible experience and was still starving, I was not happy that the server said I had already spoken to the manager.  I am disappointed that a small restaurant in downtown Phx that was featured on a national TV Show didn't care enough about a local to come over and say anything, giving us the meal to go was pointless (it went in the trash)  Next time work on customer service, not pushing the bill on guests (there was no longer a wait) and make sure EVERYONE in the party has their meal. It's a little late to ever change my opinion, maybe my friends (yes I have told a lot of ppl about this experience) will still go and judge for themselves. If they do my advice I told them... don't go hungry, you may not get your food.",

    "text": "If you are ever in the downtown Phoenix area I highly suggest you drop in on this retro/modern diner that was featured on Guy Fieris Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.I have been in phx area for 10 yrs and finally decided to try this critically acclaimed diner. Aside from being slightly difficult to find (my inability to give directions, lol), Matts is an excellent healthy alternative to your run of the mill breakfast places. I went on the thursday morning prior to Superbowl 49 expecting lines to be around the corner even though it was close to 10 am. Although busy, our party of 3 didnt have to wait at all.  While ordering and eating it became busy enough that people began to have to wait.  I chose to order the cheese omelet with mushrooms, onions and sausage. I also had  their hash browns, wheat toast and coffee.  where do I begin? The coffee is so good that it needs little if any sugar in the raw (rather than processed) or milk (organic).  The toast is thick and grainy (aka awesome) and best of all not processed. To accompany the great toast was a sweet yet all naturally made on site raspberry preserve. I was informed that this was a rare occasion that they were sering the raspberry as they normally serve strawberry or bluberry also both all natural and delicious (im guessing).  The first few bites of both the omelet and hash browns threw me for a loop until I figured out that I was tasting or rather wasnt tasting artificial cooking oils or grease (which unfortunately Im used to). I was actually TASTING the food. I typically do not care for hassh browns because they tend to either be too dry or not dry enough but these were perfectly done with just enough crisp and moistness....no need to add anything other than a bit of hot sauce.  The omelet was thin and large enough to hold all the cheddar cheese, onions, and mushrooms. Unfortunately either the waitress didnt hear me order the sausage or the cook forgot to add them to the omelet. Had the sausage been in the omelet I think they would have needed a third egg to hold all the additions. The atmosphere on this particular day was one of turn and burn (aka busy) and locals, and out of towners.",

    "text": "Wife took me here on a day off. Knowing I love breakfast I had to try this place out. The first challenge was finding a parking spot. We eventually found a spot & just by looking at the line outside, we feed the meter for two hours of parking. We weren't aware of signing in on a list until a waitress came outside shouting names. I was eventually told you have to sign up on the list inside. After waiting for 45 minutes we were seated at the breakfast bar and the waitress took our order right away. We both ordered the hog and chick plate. We asked if it was possible to order a single griddlecake on the side knowing it wasn't on the extras menu. She was able to accommodate our request. I also ordered a coffee and orange juice. Coffee to me was coffee but the freshly squeezed OJ had my taste buds ready for the rest of the meal. Seriously refreshing. The bacon, eggs, sourdough toast & fruit preserves were on point. Tasty, tasty, tasty. Wife & I honestly didn't care to much for the rosemary home fries...way too much rosemary seasoning & garnish for us. Next we decided to bite into the griddlecake & again our taste buds were in heaven. Soft and moist like a baked cake in the form of a pancake...the best we've ever had. This place is going to be my go to breakfast joint on another day off no doubt. The wait time was definitely worth it. Thanks to the staff for their prompt & friendly service. We'll be returning whenever I have business to do in Phoenix.",

I had the Hog and Chick.  Excellent hash browns...riced potatoes with a nice greasy bottom with pan drippings and pepper clinging to them.  Just the way I like them!   The strawberry jam with the toast was superb.  And the coffee hot and tasty...no need for cream.  The bacon was curiously unflavorful.  Next time I'd get sausage.  Not sure what went wrong with it...not enough salt/smoke in the curing?  It was cooked okay, just not a lot of flavor to it.  (Of course, I still finished it...even mediocre bacon is still bacon!)  $12 for a breakfast seemed a bit on the high side, but not super exorbitant.  Had the bacon been good I would not mention the cost.  Still a fan though.  3.5 stars would be a better rating.",

This is legal \"crack\" if there is such a thing.  It was rather loud inside but not annoying for such a small place. Since the weather is so hot, while you wait outside they have refreshing lemon water to keep you cooled off. Had to split checks at the minute and it was not a problem. Definately visiting there again if I ever return to Phoenix!",

They have daily specials which today (Tuesday) was biscuits and gravy which is what I got and let me tell you they were fantastic. I like to consider myself a b&g connoisseur and these were up there and top best for me imo. I split the pancakes as well and those were also great.   The only cons I really found were they don't give you enough syrup and to get more it's an additional 1.50. Also they don't serve alcohol which is a bummer at the location we were at. But other ones do! (They are supposed to have good blood Mary's I believe at the airport one)   Overall great Phoenix spot to check out for breakfast or brunch! It was so good I forgot to take pics of my food! I was only able to capture my friends daughter checking out the menu.",

We came on a weekend and although there was a 45 min wait it was worth it with plenty nearby to occupy. Seating is somewhat limited but they turnover tables fast.   The menu was simple but the options were all you need and more. I like the daily specials and the unique takes on well known dishes. I ordered the jalapeno scramble and it was delicious and had me sweating by the end.   I would recommend for families and small parties and I look forward to coming back.",

The syrup was served too hot, which made it the consistency of water. I asked for an extra and was told I would be charged $1.50. Really????  Again, the bacon was pretty good.",

We placed a to-go order (skip the long waits!) for the chop and chick and the five spot. The pork chop was huge (great value), the rosemary potatoes were very tasty, and the toast was super thick and soft. It came with a great mixed berry compote as well. The five spot had awesome thick cut bacon and good flavor with the grilled onions. All of this came out to around $20 after tax which is a great value.  I would definitely come here again and I'm not even a big breakfast/brunch kind of person!",

The toast was fluffy and perfectly buttered and it comes with homemade compote. The omelet was also fluffy and fully cooked. Nothing I hate more than an undercooked omelet! So kudos to them for getting that right! But I just have to GUSH about the hash browns. Literally, the BEST hash browns I've had in all my 40 years on this earth. I don't even want to know how they make them as I'm sure it is with many things not approved by my healthy eating plan. LOL. But I HIGHLY recommend the hash browns. Run, don't walk! The honey lemonade was also a perfect accompaniment to this AMAZING breakfast. Will definitely be back!",

The bread is obviously homemade and sliced about an inch thick with butter and jam it was so so so good. I wish i could have tried the french toast because im telling you the bread is that good. I cant wait to go back and bring others with us. By the time we left at 1015 there was an hour wait so go early if you can. The coffee was good too just black. It was nice smooth and they have raw sugar if u like it sweet. We will be back.",

The homemade ketchup and hot sauce were delicious. I would definitely recommend any dish with bacon which was thick cut and awesome! Fair price and good food, I will be back again when I am staying in downtown Phoenix.",

I selected the Skinny without cheese & really enjoyed the turkey sausage, egg white omelette & the fresh salad.  The staff were extremely friendly & the atmosphere in the place was fun to go with the decor!!  It ended up being about $14 as I got tea as well.  I will be back the next time I am in town.",

I picked this place because I had heard they do take reservations of a large groups and thought how sweet is that, I called them and verified that they do, then told them I would call back with the final details.  When I got all the information, called them back and told them what day & time and how many, and was told then that the reservations is actually for groups of 5 or smaller :( whomp whomp , but was told that they could hold a party of 15 we just needed to get on the list, and then she asked what is the meaning for the reservations, and I said we are monthly breakfast club and we picked Matt's to try this month, I was then told that Matt's turns tables over fast is it's not really the type of place to hold meetings, I laughed and said the type of meetings we are doing is eating.    Got there around 8am on Sat morning, put my name on the list for a party of 15, I was then told that the entire party needs to be there in ordered to be seated, I told her that I would need to be saving one seat, someone is running late, I was told only way to save a seat is to order their food for them that way all orders are going in at the same time.  Just stating this on the review to give people with groups the heads up. Everyone showed up, and we were seated pretty quickly!  When I figured out that we were headed to Matt's Big Breakfast, what I wanted to order, had to have, needed to taste was there waffles, when I got into Matt's and seated at the table I looked up and saw the daily special and said, oh that's what I'm having.  It was three eggs scrambled with Schriener's chorizo fresh jalapenos cheddar cheese and home fries and flour tortilla. This dish was delish!! The jalapenos where so fresh!! The home fries were perfectly cooked; the eggs & chorizo were very good stuffed in that flour tortilla! Only thing that could have made this better was some great hot sauce! The dish for me was lacking in heat, but was great in flavor!   I did see a waffle or 2 at the table, and let me tell you, they looked great, but I think I made the right choice, see I like to have some waffle of pancake with my syrup and at Matt's you get 2 ounces of real maple syrup, additional 2 ounces can be bought for a buck 50, so if it was me, I would be spending like 5 bucks just on syrup.   Wonder if I can bring in my own haha  I have wanted to try Matt's Big Breakfast for a very long time now and am very happy I did, everything is fresh and fast! I look forward to coming back!",

A customer next to us ordered the special of the day and it looked so good we had to get the same! It was some sort of sausage hash with rosemary potatoes (writing this review a few weeks later so I can't remember exactly.) First off, it was a HUGE serving. the rosemary potatoes were perfect and the strawberry jam that came with the toast tasted like biting into a fresh strawberry.   This is definitely the best breakfast in Phoenix.",

I decided not to order my usual 5-spot breakfast sandwich and had the Hog & Chick menu item for a change.  I ordered my eggs over easy and hashbrowns, instead of the country potatoes.  All three of us order the hashbrowns and all three of us were very disappointed.  The hashbrowns were soggy, lukewarm, and almost the consistency of mashed potatoes in the middle.  Yuck!  My easy over eggs still had runny whites all around the yolk... double yuck!!  The only saving grace was the yummy bacon.  The food certainly wasn't worth waiting in line to get in the joint.  If we go back, I would stick with the 5-spot breakfast sandwich and the country potatoes.",

Besides the pancakes, everything else is pretty spot on. The chick and chop - delicious, tender, subtle herb seasoning pork chop w/ eggs on the side. The hashbrowns? Off the hook! Buttery and crispy. Bacon? OMG. Perfectly shaped, and wonderfully crisp.   And the service, for being as busy as it is, they make you feel right at home. Sure, the manager checks in with you towards the end, so she can gauge when you will leave the table, but it still felt genuine. Made us feel right at home, like a regular \"veteran\" - despite really only visiting once a year on our Spring Training trips.   See you next year, Matt. See you soon (but not soon enough).",

The bacon is thick cut....I love me some crispy bacon but even if you ask for it crispy it just never comes out that way. The sausage is good but I wish it had more seasoning like sage and all the other yummy stuff they put in sausage.

I like that their menu is limited, so I don't have to worry about my indecisiveness getting in the way. I almost always just order the special. If you go on the weekends, prepare to wait, but I promise the lines move quickly.   Things I'd like to see: mimosas and bloody Mary's. My friend and I asked once if they served mimosas and our waitress looked at us like we were alcoholics. We aren't, but if we were, even more reason to slam some OJ and champagne in front of us.   Things I could go without seeing: Since alcohol is not served, I'd assume this spot would qualify as a family establishment. With that said, the waitresses could cover up their tatas. When I ordered biscuits, what was busting out of their shirts weren't what I meant. But your boyfriend might be okay with it.   Overall - love this spot. I crave it often.",

The food is good, solid fare and you could do a lot worse for breakfast, but I just cannot wrap my head around why people are so nuts about this place.  This place is only worth it if you're willing to get up and go in before 7 so you don't have to wait for a table.  If you see people waiting outside, go somewhere else, because the food is very much typical breakfast food that you could easily get elsewhere downtown.  If you get it, it's very good and the staff are very friendly, but the wait time baffles me.",

I know it's a serious allegation to make, but I think the staff I encountered on the day I went there with my girlfriend were likely racist. I'm not saying they were for sure, but to me it was strange that the waitress wouldn't make eye contact with my girlfriend, much less even look in her direction. In fact, I had to order for her because she blatantly ignored her. I even tried flagging a different waitress down and was met with the same behavior. I'm the first to admit if I'm being a D-Bag or rude but all we did was sit down, place our order, and eat so I can't think of any other reason why we were treated this way. We eat out a lot and were from out of town so I think our table I side manners were fine. I don't want to say this incident is representative of the staff in the restaraunt as a whole but it was definitely an unpleasant experience and I will never go back when I go back to Phoenix and I will recommend people against it when they decide to go too given it's a fairly popular restaurant. Sourness aside, the food was decent; a little cold and the honey lemonade was to die for. I've tried making it at home to no success. To bad this place is mediocre and is staffed with mediocre quality people otherwise I'd go back every time I go down to Phoenix.",

It was a Sunday and it seems as though everyone in the historic district had the same idea as we did.   Food was good, came out quickly. Only thing that I was not too happy about was the iced coffee that they offered me and my wife. It seemed too watered down, to a point where my server asked if I wanted more iced tea. Besides that we had a good time service was attentive, Never mind that we were decked out in our best 49er apparel, they still treated us like very nicely.

I waited for almost an hour to find that there were only eight things on the whole menu, and none of them were worth the wait or the price. I got the special of the day and it was, kindly put, less than special. The omelet was cold, bland, and nearly empty of filling and flavor. My boyfriend had the cold and dry pork with less-than-thrilling eggs. The only saving grace was the strawberry jam, but when jam is your only redeeming factor, you've got some work to do. After trying to power through this underwhelming meal, I got the check and thought \"THIS is what they think that food was worth?\" I entirely regret my decision to go to Matt's. I felt deceived by the four star review and felt like my fellow Yelpers deserve more honesty than that.  However, since then, I had the pleasure of going to Mark's Cafe in Tempe (at Rural and Guadalupe) and had an absolutely incredible experience. Rather than wasting your time and money at Matt's, I suggest going to Mark's. Great food, great price, great selection, great service,... Take your money to a breakfast spot that will earn it.",

Still was pretty busy but managed to get a parking spot in their tiny lot behind rather than pay a metre. Inside, we were almost immediately offered the bar area but, after sitting, found the seats are polished steel and I kept sliding off. They are not made for larger customers and some cushions with traction would not go amiss. So, we waited an extra 10 minutes for a table.  Got a large Belgian-style waffle with butter and syrup and the daily special lemonaide (strawberry honey). The lemonade was tasty and the waffle was delicious, but honestly a little costly for the amount of food. I definitely should have gone with the omelette - which is the same price but you get a huge omelette and a side of bacon and home fries! The waffle - which also comes with excellent thick-cut sliced bacon - definitely needs to come with a side of potatoes. A side of potatoes ordered on it's own is over $2.  However, service is super friendly and attentive. Still recommend this place but if you're hungry, skip the waffle and get something more generous!",

The owners and staff are amazing.  The ingredients are fresh and I have yet to have a dish I did not like.  I would come early as it is very busy, but worth the wait!!!",

We came for breakfast on Tuesday and was seated without a wait and food arrived quickly. We ordered the special scramble - grilled pork tenderloin scramble - and the waffle with bacon. The scramble was huge and the hash browns that came with it were so delicious, as everyone else has described. The waffle was light and heavenly! The bacon was seriously thick-cut and a perfect complement.   The staff was super friendly and attentive.  This was definitely a highlight of our trip.",

We tried the Thursday special- Eggs Benedict, a side order of bourbon cherry sausage, a side of bacon, and a stack of griddle cakes. All of the meats were awesome, especially the sausage! The griddle cakes were not bad, they tasted like maybe they used corn flour in addition to the standard pancakes you get everywhere. The prices are higher than your average breakfast joint, but it comes with the quality of the product, so I think they were fair for the organic options.  There is just not really any reason to go back since we tried almost the whole menu... I'm not embellishing on the small menu part!",

Yeah I know they have a place in the airport but there's something about airport food places that I don't like.  Too much hustle and bustle.  Anyway, got to Matt's at the right time.  Got a parking spot in the small lot behind the restaurant.  Went in and had a choice between sitting at a table or at the bar.  We went for the bar which offered a little more arm room for the 3 of us.  Service was great. Our server gave us tips on where to visit and other places to eat.  Food was tasty and big (no lunch for us after this breakfast).  The restaurant has a nice design featuring chalkboards with the daily specials. There was a good mix of families, workers, locals and tourist.  It is a little noisy due to the small size of the restaurant. As we left, a line for those waiting for tables started to form.  I would definitely come back to Matt's Big Breakfast.",

I don't feel that the quality and presentation are up to par for such a limited menu. If you serve few things, those few things should be executed with perfection.   Next, there is most always a wait here. I have seen the crowds and lines on the weekends. I never visit on the weekends because I don't believe that it is worth the wait. You can usually score a table with 5 mins or less wait during the week days, but you do need to arrive early.   Now let's talk service. I consistently get trash service here. It's just one square room where the servers can see you all the time but seem to just avoid your eyes when you try to catch their attention. My drinks have always sat empty, even the water! They are always rushed and don't make friendly conversation. The one compliment I do have is that the food is always FAST here. The kitchen has their act together.   Last, it is loud in there. The metal chairs scrape on the concrete floors, and those sounds combine with three dozen or so different conversations and kid noises. It is labor intensive to have a conversation! I don't want to have to scream at breakfast like it's a nightclub.  This is allegedly a Phoenix great, but not for me. The food is okay, the service is bad, and the atmosphere is better than when it was in the little house, but still not good.",

I ordered the freshly squeezed honey lemonade and waffle with bacon. When I drank the lemonade, I thought it was good..but more honey than lemon than I wished. Now...I'm craving for one.   Our food came surprisingly fast given how busy it was. I chowed down and cleaned up the entire plate very fast...the waffle was crispy on the outside and super soft on the inside, and the bacon was thick and yummy. Yum yum yum.   I tried my friend's potatoes and wheat toast with jam, it was so good! I'm a PB without J kind of person...and I really liked the jam.

The reviews are very True, anything you get will satisfy you. I highly recommend the blue berry lemonade made with honey. Absolutely love this place, I got the waffle it was perfect, portion sizes are really great and the staff is always helpful. Portions are fantastic you can't go wrong here.",

As I arrived at their downtown location, I noticed a crowd waiting outside the front of the restaurant. This is always a good sign that you're in the right place. I sat at the counter and ordered their classic Hog and Chick (bacon and eggs) with home style potatoes. Their potatoes are well seasoned and their bacon is nice and thick with the right amount of black pepper. It came with 2 thick pieces of sourdough toast with a special home made jam that you should not pass up. It actually looked like a small side of salsa. But, it came served with my toast. So I tried it and it was amazing. I don't know what's in it but, trust me when I say it's worth a try. This is significant since I'm normally not a jam person.  Great friendly staff. I highly recommend it if you're ever in the downtown Phoenix area and have time for breakfast, stop by Matt's Big Breakfast.",

I had the omelet with cheese and sausage, served with hash browns, strawberry honey lemonade, thick cut wheat toast, served with homemade preserves, and the pancakes.  -The Omelet was very hearty, I ordered it with sausage crumbles, and hash browns that were super crispy, which I loved.  - The thick cut wheat toast that came with my meal was insanely delicious with the homemade strawberry preserves that was served with it.  - The pancakes were huge, fluffy, and super delicious. I used my leftover strawberry preserves to use as a topping for my pancakes. OUT OF THIS WORLD!  This will be my go-to place, anytime I go to Arizona. I know it gets pretty crowded, we lucked out ND got seated right away. I honestly wouldn't mind waiting. The quality of food and service here will make it worth it. I look forward to visiting soon!",

It's just street parking around the restaurant, and I can imagine that when this place is busy, parking might be kind of difficult.   Inside it's wide open seating with a small counter/bar seating area as well. It's pretty noisy/loud inside, but not to the point where it bothered us. The service was excellent! Very fast! Very friendly!  The food was also excellent! We had the Skinny and the Special (egg scramble w/ schreiner's chorizo, jalapeno's, white cheddar, potatoes). Both were delicious, and were only $10.95 with good size portions! We also had the signature bourbon cherry sausage, which was a really interesting mix of flavors, and had a nice crunch to the casing. We definitely left very full!  Overall, great brunch spot in Phoenix! Highly recommend this place!",

I had the Hog & Chick which was scrambled eggs, homefries, thick cut bacon, and sourdough bread. The difference between this place and a million other run-of-the mill breakfast places is that Matt's pays attention to the very last detail. The breads, the jellies, the lemonades, ect are all homemade and delicious! The freshness and attention to detail will have me craving their breakfast til the next time.",

Always busy with a line to get in but great places are like that so if you want to eat quickly go to Dennys so I don't have to wait so long.  Everything is made from scratch and fresh. The Waffles are outstanding as are the Griddlecakes.   I am a really  big fan of the Big Butter Burger also. The burger is just plain good and when they bring it to you, you will be happy.  If you can make sure you get some bacon here which is very good.  Service is good and the new location is spacious compared to the original restaurant.  What is nice is that the small feel still transferred to the current location.  Would recommend going there either early in the morning or later prior to closing to minimize your wait.

Matt's restaurant is  located in an awesome area, located centrally in downtown Phoenix!  It is adjacent to the Phoenix farmers market and other local restarants.    Due to Matt's popularity, it is extremely busy with limited seating.  However due to the quality of their food and customer service it is well worth the wait in my opinion!  My girlfriend and I were told there would be a wait time of about 25 min.  We went to walk around and when we came back we had already been called.  The waitress in the front told us that it's okay and sat us as the next seats became available.  It's things like that, that seperate mediocre service to superb service and I will always be a customer of Matt's for that!",

You may spend the extra dollar here and there, but the portions are huge and very tasty. I had the omelette and hashbrowns, and honestly, I don't know if my mom could have made them better!  Another nice surprise was their jelly/jam. It was fresh and flavorful-not at all like a Smuckers package!  I'm very glad to say I'm within walking distance because I know I'll be coming back for more. I would say though, the lines are long for a reason! Save yourself some time and call it in to go if you have the chance!",

The have a daily specials menu for breakfast but you cant mix and match days. I didn't care much since they still another option i wanted. The service is a little slow but I guess that's what happens when the place is packed. The home made jelly was very good but it needed some sugar. I chose not to add any extra sugar since it would just ruin the flavor.",

My man-panion had the Big 5 sandwich. The onions gave it a fab flavor. It was an interesting mix of soft bun, crispy onion, salty bacon and eggs.

The bacon is thick and satisfying too and the ham steak is just another level of flavor I've never experiences during the day hours.  Portions and prices are spectacular, but now comes the bad part: the wait is worse than vegas' best nightclubs. Just like vegas too, if there's more than two of you, you're not getting in. Best bet is to order over the phone, get it to go, and enjoy this goodness at home where at least nobody else can see you drool.",

I ordered the hog and chick(wanted their french toast special bit french toast and sausage was just not enough of choices). Over medium eggs, 3 pieces of bacon(thick crunchy bacon may i add), hash browns and sourdough toast with jam. Water to drink. Eggs were nothing special but still delish. Hash browns were a little too buttery for my taste but definitely not your average tasting which i definitely enjoyed. Bacon was the best i have ever had as already mentioned, it was seasoned just right and no sogginess, all crispyness. The sourdough toast i could really keep eating. Im not sure if it was the toast or the jam but it was just perfection. Water- no sink water taste. ;-) Overall it was really good. Party of 3 only had to wait 5 minutes at 11am on Tuesday. I guess this is rare but we were fortunate. Service was friendly but did feel rushed at times. But as you see still 5 stars because at the end the food was the star.  Note - coworker had the waffles and said its one of if  not the best they ever tasted.",

    "text": "I'm quite impressed.  Very clever business model -- they work extremely efficiently, given what little space they have.  Despite how many people are always in line here, the wait is fairly reasonable.  They have you check-in when you first arrive, and they'll do periodic spot-checks to see who is still here and who just returned from a neighborhood walk.  With that comes wonderful service -- the staff seem genuinely happy to be there.  Service with a smile, really, and they were running about the organized chaos.  I never saw any one staff member stand in one place for more than a few seconds, which is nice because it shows dedication to the business.  I ordered the salami scramble with potatoes and sourdough toast.  I honestly think the best part of my meal was the toast -- crispy on the outside and soft in the center, serviced with some delicious strawberry jam (but it was fresh and tangy and flavorful!).  I think I would have been crazier about the jam, but I'm weird and not huge on jam.  I wish they had the option of butter instead.  Anyway, the salami was almost too rich for me, but it paired well with the eggs, which were nice and fluffy.  I also enjoyed the potatoes, though I thought they were a bit heavy on the rosemary, which actually surprises me because I like my food heavily seasoned.  I had a bit of my fiance's chicken artichoke sausage, which was part of the special, and that was divine.  The orange juice tasted like an orange in a glass.    A little pricey, but considering the quality of the ingredients you get (organic and local), I understand the markup.    Personally, the atmosphere isn't for me -- it's loud and clanky, but that's just my preference.  Doesn't mean it's not a good restaurant or business.  I just like it when I can have a conversation without raising my voice.  Great place, though!  Definitely a place worth checking out.",

She ordered Pancakes and My order was for The Hog & Chick breakfast, that came with 2 eggs, 2 slices of bacon, 2 slices of bread and potatoes with herb. Bacon slices were nice and thick and pancakes tasted great as well. Looking at their menu, there is not much of it. Breakfast from the looks, was pretty mediocre. Their homemade Blueberry jelly was amazing, right amount of sweet and tasted very light. In my opinion, the prices are high for the amount of food. Service was great, couple servers passed by, always filling our coffee and water. The server did not spend much time in asking if we had any questions but were quick with their services. Food came pretty fast as well. No problem there. The high stools were little uncomfortable to sit with trying to park the legs somewhere. It is a noisy place and i had a hard time understanding my friend until we started talking loud to make up for the noise. I saw the reviews of this place, i did not encounter any service issues. It is not a bad place, i would definitely go back but i will not go out my way to go back there.",

    "text": "As someone who has worked in customer service oriented businesses since my first job, I find this as one of the top things when rating all business establishments. From the first minute I walked in, there wasn't a glimpse of good customer service in the place.  The first woman greeted us and asked us to come to her host stand. We said we wanted a table and she told us to write our names down. Already slightly annoying that she asked us to do her job. She told us the wait was 30-45min and that the bar was first come first serve. Since we noticed 3 open seats at the bar, we walked up and got ready to sit down. A man that worked there walked up and said \"you need to put your name on the list.\" I mentioned that we had done that already and that the woman up front had mentioned that the bar was open seating. Very rudely he yelled, \"NO SHE DIDN'T!\" and then pointed to the host stand. You were not there when she told us it was open seating, so do not tell me what she said. Yes, she may have made a mistake, but that isn't my fault. There are much nicer ways to talk to your customers.  This wasn't even the part that made us want to leave. We continued to wait because of the excellent reputation this place has. We waited, we waited, we waited. An hour goes by and we've seen people who came in after us continue to get seated. So I approached the hostess again and mentioned that we had been waiting for over an hour and that others had been seated before us. She picks up her list and says \"well, there's still 20 people in front of you\" and shows me a completely different and new page of names that wasn't there before. I mentioned to her that list wasn't there before and showed her where our name was written. She informed us that we had \"created our own new sheet\" while they still had one they were adding names to and that we put our name in the wrong place. Well, maybe you should have done your job in the first place and written our name down for us. Not only that, even though she knew that we had been there for that long, she didn't offer to rectify the misunderstanding and seat us sooner. I will forever not eat at this place and I urge, nay, I warn you not to eat here either.",

One person orders the special for the day (usually an omelet of some sort with side of home fries) and I order the waffle and bacon and we split them both. Otherwise, if you eat the waffle by yourself, you will die (or just feel really sick because of all the butter and syrupy deliciousness).  Also, servers and other staff are always VERY friendly.

Thankfully, Matt's jumped to the top of the search and we headed to the restaurant.   We were greeted by some friendly faces and quickly grabbed a couple spots at the bar facing the window. We were waited on VERY quickly and we both tried the Strawberry Honey Lemonade. That truly hit the spot after getting hit in the face with 115 degree weather.  My wife ordered the special, Eggs Benedict and I had the Salami and Eggs scramble. The food came out REAL fast and boy am I glad it did. Everything had that \"home cooked\" taste. The salami and eggs had that salty deliciousness you'd expect from a dish like that. The hash browns were extra crispy with the right amount of seasoning. What I'm still craving (12 hours later) is the fresh baked sourdough bread with the homemade strawberry jam! I could eat a loaf of that and be one happy (and fat) Yelper.   My wife's Eggs Benedict was also incredibly well put together and tasty. The English muffins were thick and crispy and the Canadian bacon was generously cut.   Next time we're in Phoenix, we definitely want to try out the lunch options. Great work!!!",

    "text": "So here is a crazy, slightly relevant way to describe Matt's Big Breakfast.  Matt's is one of the places you are almost obliged to like, because if you don't, you look like a total, unsophisticated schmuck.  No one talks shit about this Phoenix icon!  To speak one bad word of Matt's is like cursing the Virgin Mary.  But here is the thing, all the genuine, honest compliments you can heap onto Matt's is well deserved.  It's like the cool kid in school is well liked for legitimate reasons, not just because he/she is popular.    Meal: The fiance does a great job of always getting something new here.  Typically its a vegetarian omelet.  I typically get the slinger (shhhssssshhhh, secrete menu item!) and whatever special lemonade is available.  Taste:  Every bite is pure heaven.  The homemade jams are special and remind me of home in the midwest.  The ingredients are fresh.  The homemade bread is spectacular.  The meals are amazing.  I feel like its a safe bet in saying that Matt's is the best place to get breakfast in Phoenix.  10 out of 10.  Value:  You aren't going to get a steal here, but then again, this isn't Home Country Buffet.  The portions are above equivalent to Denny's and the prices are about the same.  Because of the great taste and freshness, the value is above average.  4 out of 5.  Service/Cleanliness:  This place is busy.  There are always lines, but they are efficient and quick.  The waiters and waitresses are always pleasant.  The are knowledgeable and the seem genuinely excited about the food they serve.  They sometimes lack attentiveness, but it doesn't come off as being inept.  8 out of 10.  Atmosphere:  Matt's fits the the downtown scene.  And Matt's is the type of place where the things on the wall don't distract from the food.  The crowd is very diverse and the dining area is kind of loud, but kind of perfect.  5 out of 5.  Overall:  If heart disease didn't run in my family, I would eat here way more often.  Believe the hype, Matt's is the place to be! 27 out of 30 points, 5 out of 5 stars.",

I usually order eggs; any recommendations fellow Yelpers? What am I missing? Ha! Further, I preferred their old, tiny location, which gave them more charm than their new, darker location.

If it is your first time, maybe decide to go on a weekday instead.   I have the say the hour wait was worth it! They have great daily specials chalked on their blackboard in the back and good coffee. I understand where the BIG part comes in when you see the dishes. I ordered a waffle with a side of bacon and hash browns. Hash brown was delicious.  The bacon is the good kind! They were thick, succulent slices, not overly thin and burnt to a crisp stuff. By sampling a bit from everyone else's plate, I got to say everything was top notch.  Hopefully, I will return for a second  helping!",

The waffle is still my go-to meal, as it is the right amount of fluffiness.  Plus it comes with bacon!  And the bacon here is amazing... thick, peppery, and cooked just right.  I have a hard time ordering bacon at any other restaurant as it simply does not compare with Matt's.  The daily special usually consists of an egg scramble and a side of potatoes and is wonderful as well.  The food here cannot be beat.  Now that they've moved to a larger location, too, going to eat is more reasonable.  The wait can still be long during peak hours, but it's not nearly as bad as it once was.  The restaurant still maintains its character even with a new home.  If I had to pick one restaurant to take a friend for breakfast, this would be it.  Breakfast at its finest.",

I'm from Northern California, and organic is everywhere so I didn't feel this was that special.  But Monday morning, I woke up at 6 am and was starving by the time my lecture was over, and figured Matt's was the closest.  I headed over there and had the best meal in Phoenix.  I had the Monday Special, which was Huevos Rancheros.  Can eggs, tortillas and cheese melt in your mouth?  First time it did for me.  Also, I could just eat their strawberry preserves for breakfast.

Seasoned with black pepper...oh man.  *Eggs are organic and cage-free, score!  *Go with Hog & Chick to get the best of both.  *Strawberry jam is home made and I could just drink it like a fruit drink...so good.  *Friendly service...mostly young kids who are going to school nearby. ASU.  *Inexpensive for the amount of food you get.  *Bread taste's like it's made in house...yummy.  *Coffee isn't life changing but it will do a good job of waking your butt up. *Check out their daily specials it happened to be the one my wife picked and it was delicious!",

Awesome customer service- two thumbs up!",

    "text": "Never should have waited so long to finally experience Matt's Big Breakfast!!  My daughter is a flight attendant and was laying over in downtown Phoenix so I suggested we go to breakfast up the street from her hotel at Matt's. Waited outside about 15 minutes on a very busy Sunday.  As we entered the noise was extremely loud so conversation was not going to be the highlight of our meal.  But the food was so good we didn't need to talk, just enjoy the meal!  My daughter said the coffee was excellent and the OJ terrific.  I had the honey strawberry lemonade it is was refreshing.  We both ordered exactly the same breakfast, the hog and chick (bacon and eggs with home fries).  Dish was served with sour dough bread and fresh strawberry preserves, delicious!!  Our eggs were cooked perfectly, sunny side up.  The potatoes were to die for.  Tasty chunks of potatoes with fresh rosemary and onion, these are a must try if you eat here!  But the thick cut bacon was my favorite of all!!  Thick slices smothered in pepper and cooked perfectly, not burnt nor overly crispy, just enough where the bacon was fully cooked yet tender.  It was a bacon delight.  I'll be back without a doubt, still want to try the waffle with real maple syrup and more!  Great breakfast, thank's Matt's!!",

We ordered a 5 spot, a chop and chick, and a hog and chick. Food came really fast, within 10 minutes. The bacon is some of the best bacon I have ever had. It is thick and has great flavor. The hash browns might have been the best thing on the plate. Buttery and just enough salt. The sourdough bread was soft and sour and with some of the jam it was the perfect bite.  From being seated to leaving it only took like 30 minutes. It's fast and delicious.",

We found Matt's Big Breakfast on Yelp; and with over 550+ reviews with an average of 4-stars, we decided that this was the place to try out.  We came here on a Friday at 11am on 3/27/15 during Spring Training.  We thought that if we arrived after the breakfast hour and before the lunch hour, we could beat the crowd.  We were wrong!  This place was ultra crowded!  We put our name down and still waited 30+ minutes for a party of 3.  The good thing is that while we waited for a table, we had plenty of time to check out their menu and their specials, so we were able to order once we were seated.  They even provide you with water outside their restaurant while you wait.  As for the food.., it was very delicious!  They use real maple syrup, their strawberry jam has actual strawberries in them, their bacon was crispy and NOT greasy!  Their quality was fantastic, their prices was low, and the quantity was very good.  Other than the long wait for a table, I loved everything about this restaurant.  I will definitely dine here again the next time I'm in Phoenix!",

I have to say the Manager seemed to not be very helpful as I was brought the wrong food TWICE and when he brought me what I actually ordered he said \"sorry she messed up when she put it in\" I'm pretty sure that wasn't the case but even if it was for a manager to place blame on his servers I felt was wrong especially since he brought me the wrong food the second time! Other than that the food was good can't really mess up eggs. I would prefer two slices of thin toast then one thick piece but that's just me.",

They give you the bread on the side and you basically have to assemble the sandwich yourself which is impossible because the ham is HUGE! Not complaining because it lives up to its name, it's a damn big breakfast! I enjoyed the choice of sourdough, white or wheat bread which i chose wheat. Their honey lemonade is to die for !!! The eggs were eggs, I mean who can mess that up?! The hashbrowns however were terrible. Something off about the taste and they were incredibly soggy on the bottom! There's crazy road construction outside of this location so it's hard to hard and navigate to get to it. Their griddle cakes are amazing, good flavor to them and they are huge and fluffy !

Being next to the bathroom probably ruined the experience because of the smell. Why even have tables there??   I ordered the skinny with potatoes. It was nothing special whatsoever. The eggs were super greasy and had my stomach churning. The potatoes were also way overcooked, and the rosemary tasted like ornamental, not cooking rosemary.   For the price there is no way I'll be back, but Matt's get's 2 stars and not one because my friend liked his waffle",

The sound within the restaurant is amplified due to the small area, and metallic objects making the restaurant an even harder environment to converse in. During my five visits to this restaurant, I've had to more or less yell to speak to the person sitting directly across from me which, isn't ideal. The food is okay, here it's not absolutely amazing but neither is it bad. So while I enjoy their coffee, I myself am just unable to deal with the loudness of the restaurant so therefore, I shall not be returning here anytime soon.",

    "text": "Matt's Big Breakfast was featured on Food Network's Diners, Drive-ins & Drives! And this meant that even though it was a 45 minute wait for brunch, we were going to wait and stick it out. This isn't really related to the food or service but they have a really fantastic mural on the side of their wall. A cute photo op for sure! Anyways, they have a pretty small menu and it's very straightforward. All their lemonades are made with honey too instead of sugar which is an interesting change. We ordered their Honey Strawberry Lemonade and weren't quite sure if we liked it or not. Maybe lemonade is just meant to be made with sugar!  We ordered The Five Spot with House Potatoes (breakfast sandwich with 2 eggs, 2 slices of thick-cut bacon, American cheese, grilled onions) and The Chop & Chick with Hash Browns (2 eggs, skillet-seared Iowa pork rib chop). Now, Guy Fieri actually said on Food Network's Best Thing I Ever Ate that his breakfast of choice is The Chop & Chick. It didn't look too impressive when it came out and it didn't taste all that impressive neither so I have no idea what Guy Fieri is talking about. The pork chop honestly was thin, dry, and pretty flavorless. We didn't like it at all as far as pork chops go. I wouldn't order this or recommend this dish ever. My Five Spot was a little better but it wasn't anything that I could't make at home. Nothing special at all. Just your average breakfast sandwich you can get anywhere. The one thing that really made Matt's stand out was their potatoes. It was seasoned to perfection with herbs and aromatics which made the potatoes the best part of our breakfast. Also the toast and preserves that came with The Chop & Chick. That was also delicious.   Honestly, I wouldn't really recommend Matt's Big Breakfast. It wasn't worth the wait at all and I didn't understand the hype. I don't even understand why it's called Big Breakfast when the portion size was average at best. If I had to dine here again, I would just order their house potatoes with some toast. At least then I wouldn't walk out feeling like I spent too much on some mediocre food. 3/5",

The daily specials are nice additions but they were unwilling to substitute anything so that was a let down.  I just wanted a different cheese in the scramble and they refused to do so.    The food was good but between the parking and lack of selection I'll probably go elsewhere in the future.",

Definitely worth the trip/journey if you'er not in the area. Don't let the wait time scare you, it's so worth it.   We had to wait a half an hour to get seated, which wasn't too bad. The beautiful AZ weather made it a pleasant wait and it went by quick.  We were seated at the bar which was quick and convenient, but the bar stools were not that comfortable.    The food came out relatively quick for how packed the place was.    I wanted either pancakes, french toast or a waffle.  The waffle decision was made easily because the side of bacon it came with sealed the deal for me.  The waffle was cooked to the perfect consistency and you could tell the batter was home made and not some Bisquik instant waffle. Very flavorful.  The side of crisp peppered bacon was the perfect savory compliment to the sweet delicious waffle.    I also sampled my buddy's pancakes, they were amazing, very tasty.  Simple menu, but the food speaks for itself.  I can't wait to come back and try something else ;-)",

A roughly 20 minute wait and we were seated and served promptly at about 10am.    After approx 10 minutes or so, food was served.  We ordered the special (thick cut French toast) and a plate with eggs, bacon and hash browns.  Hash-browns were thick and oily,  practically dripping.  French-toast was thick cinnamon and raisin bread, maple maple syrup.  Nothing more.  It was really just thick toast.  Bacon... thick and dry, pretty crispy.  The homemade lemonade was really really sweet and seemed to me a mix of strawberry or blueberry syrups in our cups with lemonade.   Wasn't exciting or homemade in flavor.  All in all,  food was sub-par on a scale with a typical IHOP or Dennys, but much more expensive.  Food and drink for three before tip tallied at over $50.  Kind of a bummer.  Service was good all around.  I wouldn't come back.",

I ordered a cup of coffee to drink and the cheese omelette with a side order of bacon. Ordering the side of bacon was a must based on word of mouth and all of the reviews.   Coffee was very good and fresh.   My omelette was excellent, fluffy and full of melted American cheese. It was served with either hash browns or home style potatoes. I opted for the potatoes and they didn't disappoint. Seasoned with rosemary which was unique and delicious.   Now to that bacon...It was probably the best bacon I have ever had. Thick cut, peppered and tender. Cooked just right. Oh so good. All of those reviews were spot on.   I am already looking forward to my next visit.   Matt's is a must!   Enjoy!",

The home fries were perfectly seasoned and the Orange juice was amazing. Who knew OJ could be that good. I thought this was a great breakfast and well worth the wait. I'll be back",

    "text": "Orange juice is damn good. it's really good. I would argue perhaps the best thing on the menu. Omlette was good, but not the best I've had. It was a little on the soft side and wouldn't have hurt to use a little more cheese. I had to be liberal with the salt and pepper. The toast was cut very thick. One of the highlights was the fresh homemade jam, but you really had to slather it on heavy to have the flavor balance out how thick the toast was with each bite. I would have preferred thinner slices.  As compared to other places I've eaten with \"big\" breakfasts, this \"big\" isn't really that big. It's actually quite manageable, which I appreciate and would return for. The new space is beautiful - very old meets new industrial diner feeling. Love the giant wall board in the back creating a hallway to the bathroom.  No wait when we went, which was definitely nice. Seems like a really family friendly joint.",

Everything was good I'm guessing the hype is over the breakfast meats which I don't eat. I have to say even as a pescetarian the bacon and sausage looked good. I wouldn't go back alone but I would definitely take some of my carnivore friends there. Staff was great and the place was very accommodating to children. Super pork-centric. If you eat pig, I would recommend you get yourself in there.",

My Belgian Waffle was topped with a mound of delicious sweet cream butter.  When it melted together with the pure maple syrup on my fork full of waffle, I  reached breakfast Nirvana!  The hash browns were the best I've had in recent memory.  Clearly fried in lots of butter.  The outside perfectly crisp, and the inside was soft, buttery potato perfection.  My companions had a cheese omelet and pastrami scramble  I tried them both and they too were outstanding!  The mixed berry jam was wonderful.  The Chef (owner?) stopped by our table and explained she makes it weekly from whatever berries are available.   Service was outstanding and all the workers seemed to be having a great time, which made the visit even more enjoyable.  A big tip-o-the cap to everyone at Matt's.  If I lived in Phoenix I would be a regular!",

Having gotten rave reviews from the local paper and from the community in general, always be prepared to wait about an hour to get a table.  The food is by no means bad, but with the exception of their daily special, their selection is ordinary - this took me by surprise considering how many people rave about the place.  On top of this, the service hasn't been great.  The only time we've had decent service was when the waitress was trying to flirt with my friend, which was honestly rather amusing.  That aside, they do make pretty good pancakes and if you do really insist on seeing what the hype is all about, I advise you to stop by within an hour of opening to avoid the wait.",

When I received my check, I noticed the extra charge for the gravy was $3.95.  Now the entire meal was $10.95.  I was charged almost 40% for a little extra gravy.  When I questioned the tab, I was told that I ordered a side of gravy and that was the cost.  Really good food, but I felt like I got nickel and dime'd for the extra gravy.

The reviews on YELP were great and it's only a short walk away, in the hot Phoenix sun, so we thought we'd check it out. When we walked in we were promptly greeted and seated ourselves at a table for two. There are tables and a breakfast bar to eat at. The restaurant was busy but not crowded. I can imagine that people are waiting in line to eat at Matt's on weekends. Our waiter and waitress, yes, we had several people take care of us, quickly took our order. Great team work! I had the Hog and Chick, with an extra egg and bacon. My wife had a waffle with a side of bacon. My meal came with home fries and toast, I also ordered a freshly squeezed OJ and we both had coffee. The coffee was good and refills were plentiful. The OJ was freshly squeezed and delicious. The service continued to be great and our meals came out in a timely manner. I had ordered my eggs over easy because I like my eggs runny. Two eggs were cooked perfectly but one had no runny yolk. My home fries were cooked with onions and rosemary and were piping hot. My toast was only one slice of wheat but was very thick and easily compared to two slices of regular wheat toast. The star of the show, for me, was the bacon. It was two of the best slices of tender, thick cut bacon I have ever had, at a breakfast place. My wife told me that her waffle was really good and agreed with me on how good the bacon was. Matt's Big Breakfast did not disappoint. If your visiting the area or just dumping your kid off at ASU, definitely head to Matt's Big Breakfast.",

My partner and I picked out a weekday to venture out to Matt's since I'm not big on waiting for food. I'm hungry, get me a table, take my order and put the plate in front of me a few minutes later. Matt's did just that and more.   After a quick drive into Phoenix from our home in the vast wasteland of corporate chain restaurants that comprises Desert Ridge we made it to Matt's. YEAH!!, no wait we were seated right away. Our server came by quickly and took our beverage orders while giving us a few minutes to peruse the menu.  I ordered the special and he had the Chop and Eggs. We shared a side of sausage. TI hhe coffee was amazing as were both breakfasts. I'm not a fan of their Home Fries but you should try them anyway...it may just be me.  I haven't looked yet, but there are probably hundreds of reviews for Matt's. We were probably just the last ones to get there. Unless you go after us for the first time, then YOU'LL be the last ones to discover this amazing breakfast spot.",

    "text": "Wasn't Worth the Drive Across Town  I had heard a lot of hype about Matt's, and had friends who went there who raved about the place, so I made the 30 minute drive to try it out.   The place was packed, and had people waiting for tables, so I took an open spot at the counter. To start with, the stools were completely made of metal, including the seat which was hard, slippery, and shaped like a button mushroom with no contours for comfort. I was uncomfortable and felt like I had to brace my knees against the counter in order not to slide off.  It didn't take very long to place my order, for the \"Chop & Chick\" and I was brought coffee right away. The server was friendly. The coffee was alright, but the server didn't return to see if I wanted a refill while I was waiting for my breakfast. The wait to receive my food was on the long side, but I can see that being so busy would slow the process. The wait wouldn't have been a big deal, but my stool was so extremely uncomfortable that I almost left.  When I was just about at the end of my patience sitting so uncomfortably, my food came, and the server finally refilled my coffee.   I can't say anything good about it. The portion was average - disappointing given the \"Big\" in the restaurant's name. My pork chop was way overcooked (dry) and apparently unseasoned, and there is nothing complementary that I can say about the home fries. They didn't mess up the scrambled eggs, but my breakfast overall was so unappealing that I only ate a couple of bites. Since my server hadn't returned to see if my meal was satisfactory, I decided to throw in the towel and just get off of that stool and out of there. I left enough money for the food, headed out the door, and back across town and had a fine breakfast elsewhere.   At Matt's, I didn't get quality, quantity, value, flavor or service. I didn't even get breakfast.",

Unfortunately, we ended up waiting nearly 40 mins for our food which was a tad bit disappointing because I heard good things about this place and service.   Food eventually came out and was delicious... What amended the situation for me was managements handling of the everything. Without us even complaining they paid for our meal and apologized for the wait.   Shout out to management for the professionalism. We will be back.",

I am not sure, but the lines outside Matt's Big Breakfast were certainly an indication of the semi-fancy breakfast joint has remained popular. But why exactly?  Matt's Big Breakfast has good breakfast, certainly. But it wasn't so much different than typical diner food. I will credit them with some of the best bacon I've ever had: Thick cuts of fatty, salty, peppery bacon. Definitely amazing.  But otherwise: Eggs, slightly too herbal potatoes, some toast for $9.  The menu is also surprisingly small with typical waffles and omelets at a definitely price premium. They even have a bowl of Frosted Flakes for $5. Why anyone would go out to eat and pay $5 for that, I cannot fathom.  If it wasn't for that amazing bacon, I would have frankly felt ripped off and that I had wasted my time in line. That's the problem with a lot of semi-fancy breakfast joints, the hype leaves you disapointed.",

The potatoes aren't the healthiest option but it tasted so good with the grilled onions. I had the sausage which was a little too salty.   They gave us bread with strawberry preserves. They were sweet and Greta taste.   If we lived here, this would be a regular spot.",

The hams and the bacons.... amazing!!  The food here is definitely worth the wait.  The place is alway very cramped but it's okay, it's a small little place.  They also have another location, but I have not been to that one, I think it's at the airport.  Overall this is a great little place in the downtown area, I highly recommend this place.

The one place that has the best bacon, the best hash browns, the best eggs, the best pancakes, the best maple syrup, the best toast, the best jam, and the best coffee all under one roof!!  I love Matts BB!  It has a local, relaxed vibe, the clientele is hip and  cool, and the staff is friendly and attentive.  There can be quite a long wait if you decide to go during peak weekend breakfast/brunch hours, but trust me, the wait is worth every minute.  When it comes to breakfast, I'm a pretty straight forward guy.  Bacon, eggs, potatoes and toast please.  And if I'm feelin' really hungry (and who are we kidding?  I'm always feelin' really hungry) i'll order a pancake for dessert.  Oh, and don't forget the coffee and OJ.   The bacon is unbelievably good; addictively good; sinfully good!  Thick, smokey, peppery, and mmmmmmmmmm, just perfect!  The hash browns are another masterpiece.  Crispy outside, tender and buttery inside.  The pancakes are delicious.  Light, fluffy, and and hot off the griddle; not dense and doughy like most diner pancakes.  You can taste the quality and freshness in every little detail.  The eggs, the toast, the jam, EVERYTHING!!  the decor is simple and unpretentious.  Just one big room with a bunch of tables, a bar that seats about 8 peeps, with a TV to watch Sunday morning football, (thanks for that, Matt!!), and a little side room that seats about 6-8 people in case you have a big group.  If you're ever in Phoenix, hungry, and looking for a down home place to have some down home grub with top notch quality, freshness and love for food, this is the place to be.  I cant wait to go back.",

    "text": "WOOOOOOOOWWWWWW!!!   I FEEL LIKE I'M TAKING CRAZY PILLS!!!   What are all of these people doing giving such high reviews???   Once a month, I meet up with my ladies. But after one of our foursome flaked, it was me and another femme with our name on the list for 3.  (We were waiting for drunky who probably slept in).  We went to the brand-spankin' new location which is apparently huge with a whopping 9 whole tables!!! (It could be more, but I am not exaggerating, I can only remember 9) We waited for 20 minutes in the waiting area, and our friend was still not there (suspected hangover) but they called our names and we were seated.  Our lovely young male waiter came along and we ordered drinks and told him our friend would be along at any minute.  He said no worries and would be back with our beverages.    Let me start off by saying I NEVER go to breakfast joints because I do not eat eggs.  No I'm not a vegetarian or vegan, I just hate the idea of eating a fetus.  That's all.  Unfortunately that left me with one or two options with the VERY egg heavy menu... A Waffle meal, a side order of sausage or juice.  Bring on the waffles!!!! We wait, and wait, and wait for our slacker friend for ten minutes. During the ten minutes waiting for our friend, it began to get PACKED at the front door with foodies glaring at our horrible twosome, for taking a four-top. HOW DARE WE!!!!! Don't blame us for where the hostess seated us?  After 10 minutes, the hostess walks over and asks us what the hold up is.   ?????   I'm sorry are we not shoveling down your \"BIG BREAKFAST'S\" fast enough for you?!  We politely stated, that our friend was going to be there any minute (she was, she was texting us that she was down the street).   THEN THE HOSTESS SAYS (verbatim): \"I'm sorry we're not supposed to seat parties until everyone is here. You're going to have to order right now.\"  ???  Appalled, and not willing to fight, I say: \"Okay, well I guess we were both getting the waffles and Britney will order when she gets here\".   THE HOSTES REPLIES: \"Unfortunately I'm going to have to ask you to order for her, or we wont be able to accommodate an order for your friend.\"  I giggled thinking she was joking.  She stared blankly at me...  WHAT??????????????  So you're telling me, that we gave you our name and our party number, 3.  You saw two of us even though your little notebook clearly said 3.  You sat us at a large table leaving the masticating buzzard hoard to wish us dead. We've been here for ten minutes when most brunch places expect you to wait at LEAST 10 minutes before ordering.  We cannot enjoy our drinks or reading the menu without feeling harassed. We have to order before our friend OR ELSE. THEN YOU TELL ME, that you will not serve a paying customer because she will order 5 minutes after us???? That's a joke right???   No joke.    (I smiled while all of this was being screamed at the hostess from my angry brain)  I tried to text Brit, but as she was parking she didn't get back to me quickly enough so we decided to order 3 Waffle breakfasts and hope Brit wasn't allergic to anything in the meal???  Luckily the second the food came out she was there and she enjoyed her waffles.  I with a bad taste in my mouth from that did not enjoy anything after that experience.  Separate and apart from the hostess being a B, the waffles were decent, but not 4.5 stars decent. I would give a solid 3 for those.  Our waiter was clearly embarrassed that we were being blamed for the hostess's mistake and told us that we should take our time and enjoy our breakfast. I wish I had gotten his name because he was the only redeeming factor for this place and why it is getting 2 stars instead of one.  He is white, skinny, 20-something and really chill and relaxed. Nice guy.    I will not be returning and will find another breakfast place just as good in Phoenix, like I have all over the valley.  Plus, with more egg-less options as well!  This place has Pizzeria Bianco syndrome where they think their food is heaven sent and give you garbage service because you should be thankful they even gave you the right to eat there.  No thank you.  The bill was appropriate, not exorbitant.  But if I want to be harassed while I eat my breakfast I'll eat with my parents.   Thanks but no thanks Matt, I wish ye well. But perhaps with a better hostess.",

I remember when we could walk in and pick where we wanted to eat but that didn't last very long before everyone had their own experience and word spread fast just how amazing the food is and service has always been very pleasant.  I'm so happy that the moved to the other corner of the block for the larger location. The food is worth the wait  it's just to bad everyone else has to agree. If you are smart and a regular you can time the wait and do something else until you think you will be called next.",

    "text": "Matt's has become what some may say is an addiction of mine. I prefer \"hobby\". But Matt's did make it into our wedding vows. (True story.) You see, since I first tasted the glory of the Five Spot, I've basically made it a point to get one on every available weekend day. So my wife thought it wise to pledge support publicly in front of friends and family for my perhaps less-than-healthy \"hobby\".  The wife works a lot of weekends, and I've found out that the Five Spot can travel the 10 minutes or so to my home largely intact. A perfectly balanced combination of spot-on eggs, melted cheese, grilled onions, and THE best bacon possible makes this the absolute best egg sandwich I've ever had.   Every ingredient is so delightfully high quality that the sandwich shines, bursting forth with flavor and cholesterol and existential angst. (Or, as some might call it, \"maple syrup that I dip it in\".)   Make sure you order a side of home fries. They're specifically not included with the sandwich which is \"how they get ya\", but I can't go without. Crisp, delicious potatoes served with a few sprigs of rosemary and... also dipped in syrup.   I had over 140 check-ins to Matt's before they moved and Yelp created a new profile for them. Every single one of them? A Five Spot with Home Fries. I'm pretty sure if you ordered a \"Chris\", that's what you'd get at this point.   Their waffles are amazing too, along with basically everything else on the menu. Absolutely perfectly fluffy, flavorful, and delicious, from what I've stolen off the wife's plate. And Erenia and the rest of the staff are as kind and amazing as can be.  The wait is rough, there's no doubt about that. But whereas most breakfast places slog along with watery eggs, sub-par, see-through bacon, horrible, waxy cheese, and no twists or turns, Matt's gets it perfectly right every time. Or at least all 140 times and counting.",

This place happens to be one of the few restaurants that fills me up! It might be their amazing fresh potatoes, I swear to you they put some magical unknown ingredient in their potatoes and hash browns. Or maybe it's their daily egg scramble specials that just happen to ALWAYS be amazing. No, no...I'd say it's their fresh bread with their homemade jelly. Okay...let's be real here, it's their BACON!!! I love bacon and they make it absolutely heavenly.  Another thing to try are their pancakes. They might just be the best pancakes I have ever had. Simple buttermilk pancakes, nothing added...they are to die for. Try them, you'll keep kicking yourself in the butt if you don't!  Oh, there will be a wait...BUT IT'S SOOOOO WORTH IT!",

The walk over wasn't too bad, it wasn't too hot and it was overcast but we did come across the original location of the restaurant. So small and CUTE with its vintage vibe!  We arrived at a good time, just as we put our name on the list, a line of people arrived that bumped up from our 10 min wait became 30 mins for everyone behind us. I ordered the daily special - Three Egg Scramble. It had jalapenos, onions, chorizo, cheese and came w/ a huge tortilla. I hoped that it wasn't spicy but it was just a tad spicy for my taste. Flavorful but spicy. The hubs tried and and he said it wasn't spicy but our palettes can be very different when it comes to food.  Staff was very friendly and nice. It's not just the one person that takes your order that serves you, it was kind of nice. Our drinks were always full, we had all that we needed as soon as we asked for something, it was very refreshing to experience such service.   Will def be back when in Phoenix!",

    "text": "3/5 due to customer service and the food not being amazing just good. My family was in town and we were in the area and we were looking for a place with great reviews and Matt's Big Breakfast was up there. After reading the reviews and eating, I honestly wasn't that impressed.  When we first arrived we were asked to sit wherever there was a menu on the table. The menu was very simple, just a few breakfast and lunch options.  We ordered: the cheese omelet (had to pay extra for meat & veggies), the chop & chick, the skinny , salami scramble and a coffee = $53 before tip. We did like the fact that they had a healthier option.  I was hoping there would be a great coffee selection being that it's a local breakfast shop in the valley but they  only had basic coffee, we appreciate it being freshly brewed and my mom said the coffee wasn't bitter. So that was good.   When our food came out, the two ladies that brought out or food were honestly kind of rude.. I didn't say anything until my sister whispered over to me.. \"attitude much?\" So then I confirmed that I wasn't the only one thinking that.  As mentioned our food was okay, not really that impressed with the breakfast. I almost regret not just driving home from the event we were at that morning and making everything we ordered at home. Nevertheless, I do want to give props to that jam & hot sauce they make in house... AMAZING! The blueberry jam had a splash of citrus making a great touch with my toast and the hot sauce was not to spicy and very tangy which is right up my alley!  Our waitress did turn our experience around at the end with her smiling more and seeing if we needed anything else.",

Matt's sits in a large commercial building facility directly across the street for ASU Sun Devil Stadium.  On the other side of the restaurant is the canal which offers a beautiful view and a great boardwalk to walk off your meal.  The restaurant is spacious and offers seats at a bar, traditional tables and outdoor seating as well. The bathrooms were clean, as was the all of the surfaces in the restaurant (for those with germ phobia).   There were only a handful of people eating breakfast when I was there so not sure how well they can maintain the cleanliness when the place is bumping with a pre football game Bloody Mary crowd.  the menu was straight forward with a bit of creativity. I ordered a skinny breakfast. The portion was perfect for a large person with an appetite who is trying to eat healthy.   They let me substitute salad for fresh melons for $1 up charge. The service was really good, smiles all around and very attentive without invading your personal space.   Given a few more visits and sampling more of their dishes, Matt's could easily be upgraded to 5 stars.  Good on Yah",

I ate this as slow as humanly possible and saved one last bite for the end so that my mouth and fingers would smell like bacon.  The eggs were cooked perfectly and you could taste the quality.  The hash browns were so so crispy but inside soft and potatoey!  I loved them.  The homemade sourdough bread was light and airy with a softer, chewy crust.  The strawberry preserves were not too sweet and so fresh.  The pancake was delicious but didn't blow my mind.  Still they had me at bacon.",

We did have to wait a while to be seated, but that's expected at any respected breakfast place on a weekend morning.  I got the special of the day that was filled with jalapenos. The portion was sizeable, but it was delicious and SO spicy. The hash browns were perfectly crispy outside and creamy inside, and they and the tortillas helped cut the heat of the scramble.  The coffee was also on point. Would definitely go back if I'm in town again.",

I'm not sure if I noticed last time but I noticed this time that Guy Fieri has been here. They promptly greet you when you walk in. And they table waiting game is on. It doesn't take long even when it's packed.   I ordered the pork chop and eggs with a side of fried tomatoes. The pork chop is simple but good. The eggs were cooked how I requested. The tomatoes were good too. Moms plate was different. Kind of a custom order. It was very good she says. I didn't get a bite so I think it had to be great. Lol. The strawberry lemonade is good too. The vibe is fast paced servers and medium paced comfortable dining.   I think they handle a busy restaurant pretty well and they're friendly.",

Everyone was extremely friendly and sat us quick. It definitely made the overall experience really positive.  I opted for the Chop and the Chick and enjoyed it! The chop was decently sized and had a good flavor. It was cooked on the more well done side and I didn't mind. The eggs were nice and fluffy. They were smooth and not rubbery. Lastly the hash browns were nice and crispy!! I really like them with a little ketchup. Oh and don't forget about the toast. It's not your typical bs sliced bread. Definitely tasted like that homemade bread. It was nice and soft and had a good flavor.   Definitely come early if don't want to wait. If you are coming alone or a couple you might get lucky with a counter seat. The food cranks out pretty fast. There are a bunch of street parking around the neighborhood. The service was exceptional and definitely memorable.",

The outside waiting area has a lot of benches and it is nice to soak up the morning sun rise.   Interestingly enough, the hotel down the street, with their $30 a night rooms brought us some lively waiting entertainment.   Two men were yelling at each other, drunk or on crack.......  I thought they were going to throw down but after 15 mins, the police showed up.......  Nothing really happened, but it was amusing......  I went with the Chop and Chick.   The eggs are perfect, over easy with an ultra bright deep orange yoke - one of the best tasting eggs I have ever had.  The pork chop was average size and thickness, perfect for breakfast, great flavor and seasoning.   The hash browns will take up half the plate, if you are a fan of crispy, this is the one.   Awesome!  I would like to mention their branded ketchup and hot sauce.  Yummy!  The staff is great and hustles.   Overall a great experience.",

I will also say, the bread in the middle, away from the toast was delicious but the thin crust, was akin to a rubber band, almost impossible to chew.  I almost gave up but eventual got threw it.   The macaroni salad was \"meh\" as well, kind of the same taste as the one made at home, just less sauce. Not worth the upcharge, should have just stayed with the chips.  The saving grace, my friends meal (she bragged the whole time...argh!)  As you can see my friend had Eggs Benedict and looks delicious. She said it was excellent and the Hollandaise was one of the best she has ever had (I'm going to try next time). She said the potatoes were awesome too...and I got one...she is a selfish punk ;-) but they were good.  Great seasoning, just the right amount!",

There are a lot of great places in Phoenix for breakfast that are right in line with Matt's.   Don't get me wrong, if you pass by and there isn't a line, by all means get in there and get some bacon.

The orange juice is squeezed there and it's very tasty. The toast is enormous and the jam they make there, which is great if you love strawberry. I didn't have the bacon, but it looked and smelled phenomenal. However, the real winner is the pancakes. They were really well done and probably the best I've ever had. They has a very unique taste I can only compare to the buttery taste of Ritz crackers. Putting the maple syrup on it was actually a travesty; do it without the syrup. Overall, great breakfast spot.",

The scrambled eggs were the best my girlfriend had had and my ham, green chile, and jack cheese scramble (their special for the day) was exceptional.  The homefries and hash browns were both fantastic and the toast was great. Probably one of the best breakfasts out I've had in a long time. Definitely going to go back next time I'm in town.",

Nothing fancy on the menu; just basic meals made incredibly well with freshness you can taste. I'm vegetarian so I can't comment on the meat but the pancakes, waffles, omelettes and potatoes are perfect. Even their toast and jelly is amazing. AND they have real maple syrup!  Only downside is the wait time to be seated on weekends (which doesn't personally bother me, they're a great restaurant so you expect it). But, once you are seated and order, the food comes fast!",

Oh, one other suggestion, every movement in your establishment creates a decibel of sound.  Now add that up to a full house times a thousand movements...well you get the picture. I suggest sound abatment at least on the ceiling that way you could keep the character of the interior and serve your patrons best. Well that's my 2 cents worth.",

    "text": "Let's just say thank you yelper for getting me pretty solid reviews on this place so we don't spent a lot of time figuring out some of the must haves.  This is consider one of the decent breakfast I had in awhile.  Coming from LA area we had tons of authentic breakfast here and there, but we focus so much on specialties and yet we forget the traditional american style breakfast is liked.  Let's get to it!  Food=  4/5 nothing special made but the portion and the quality is decent to pass expectation.  The sausage is kind of overrated in my opinion, but the sandwish is a must have for first timers.  Service= 5/5 the food came so fast we don't even have the time to prepare ourselves after setting up our kids in their high-chair which is pretty solid.  When it gets busy you tends to lose their attention but when you ask any of the passing by servers, they will get to it ASAP.  The managers and the owner of the business were very friendly with greets. Wait time= 4/5 the wait can be long but we were able to get right through due to early arrival @ 6:45AM.  The parkings fill up in the back pretty quick. Location= 5/5 the location is right by the freeway so it's pretty hard to ignore/miss in my opinion.  I would give a solid 4.5 but in this case I will give them a 5 since the experience was very pleasant; this is what a good restaurant should be like.",

The wait was only about 35 min. He food is worth the wait. I love Snooze but I have to say this place beats it in flavor and quality of food. Snooze has a wider range of selections tho.

Matt's Big Breakfast is just that..BIG..  Matt's serves Classic breakfast food with a twist of unique combinations and freshness.  On my first visit I had the salami and eggs, home style potatoes  with sourdough toast and homemade peach preserves. All I can say about the peach preserves (which is made daily at Matt's) is   AMAZINGLY ADDICTING.  Try it Your taste buds will thank you.

I was so full I barely touched the hash browns and could not remember why I ordered them- I felt I needed them, for some reason. But they come in the shape of a pizza slice with a crunchy outer crust. Matt's Little Breakfast it certainly was not but we were thrilled to discover this place in our quest for pancakes!",

I had the five spot, which is a breakfast sandwich is better than you think it would be. Great and fresh two eggs with bacon and cheese! Yummy! I also got some homefries which are seasoned with rosemary and olive oil. Those are good as well. My girlfriend got the Reuben which she said was one of the best she had. The mustard has a horseradish flavor which I'm not too fond of but it went well with the sandwich. My other friend that was with us had the egg salad and she said it was bomb! I also had the blueberry honey lemonade which was great. It was a little pulpy but not too sweet and not too tart. My girlfriend had the strawberry lemonade which was less pulpy and a little more tart. Both were great. Overall a great experience and we will be back again!",

Friendly greetings and superfluous amounts of hot coffee - admittedly in the thin end of the scale, but then again I love my coffee most when it's stronger than me.  The daily menu is big and full of energy, way larger than a serving should be -  in other words, an average american size. Over a couple of days I had pancakes, hash browns, fries, goat cheese, ham, bacon, lot's of chilly and so many eggs that I had to send friendly thoughts to every egg-lovers favorite scientist, Ying Rong of Huazhong University of Science and Technology (\"Higher consumption of eggs is not associated with increased risk of coronary heart disease or stroke\"). It's a nice touch that they use real butter and cage-free egg production.   I like the place even better than the food. The place is vivacious, all customers seem happy in the loud way. Sunday was crowded and full of groups of families and friends. Going alone I mostly sit in the bar area - which creates opportunities to talk to other people. Had an interesting conversation with a local cop one day and a student the next, and of course morning banter with the staff.   Get up, get going, stop at Matt's.",

I was surprised (and a little disappointed) that the breakfast menu didn't have more selections/variety.  Once we had ordered, the food was good.  Oddly enough, I liked the thick, fresh wheat toast with home made strawberry preserves.  The liberal application of fresh rosemary in the cottage fries was nice as were the sweet, caramelized onions.  The special this morning was a Schreiner's Sicilian sausage scramble.  It was excellent and I appreciate utilizing local products.    Even though a couple of the tables around me were obviously business appointments, I wouldn't recommend it for two reasons, 1) the wait you can expect, and 2) the noise level makes it hard to conduct a meeting.  This is a good spot, the wait staff is very attentive and friendly.  I have no problem recommending it or returning.",

I wish my vocabulary was better because I'm sure there's a word better than incredible. I also recommend the coffee, it's so damn good - im an avid coffee drinker. The bacon is large and thick, it's cooked perfectly and seasoned with crushed peppercorn, but in all honesty, I'm not a fan. Dunno why, can't explain it. The servings are huge and definitely a bargain for how inexpensive they are. The hash-browns aren't my favorite. They're crispy on the outside and soggy on the inside, but I guess it's just preference.",

Their peppered bacon and rosemary home fries have changed my life!  Both perfectly prepared with super deelish eggs over easy.  I saved the best part for last - their amazing homemade rye toast and strawberry jelly with real butter soaked into its yeasty goodness!  OMG I almost moaned out loud while eating it.  Hubby loved his ham and cheese omelette too!   What was even better than their amazing food was their friendly stellar service.  EVERYONE we came on contact with there were so friendly and nice.

    "text": "The world famous Matt's big breakfast. Came down here specifically since I'd heard so many rave reviews. Maybe I ordered wrong - some of the most bland and dry pancakes I've ever had. And after spending $15 for breakfast (hash browns and milk) when I asked for a little more syrup for the pancakes, was informed they charge for xtra syrup - even though the initial syrup was a tiny metal container. Wow. Pretty sad. Won't be coming back here for sure. Otherwise the service had been quite good.  Extraordinarily noisy location as metal tables and chairs being slid around all over concrete floors - In my opinion the most underwhelming meal for the most overrated restaurant. They did end up removing the charges without my asking when I mentioned how bad the pancakes were. At least did the right thing, and like I said, maybe I ordered the wrong thing. But very disappointing meal. Manager apologized again and asked if I wanted anything else. Maybe you will fare better than I did",

I think the key was the sauteed sweet onion and the excellent roll it was made on, gave it a little bit of sweet almost maple syrup flavor. Our server was also excellent I asked for a little more coffee right as the bill came and she filled up a to-go cup for me.  My girlfriend got a Bloody Mary that I am pretty sure could have served as a meal in itself.",

They don't sell their biscuits any other way, so I had a choice of paying for the gravy & eggs too or not getting any biscuits at all. I go to restaurants so I can eat exactly what I want...so I didn't get biscuits, or anything else except the coffee I had unfortunately already ordered & the fee I paid to park at the meter because their lot was full.

It was our first time here, and decided to go with their Breakfast special - 3 eggs with bacon and jalapeno, hashbrown, and tortilla.  They use thick-cut bacon (my favorite!) The tortilla really complimented the eggs and added a nice touch. Overall, a good experience.  Didn't really see anything too special, but will come back again.",

I had an order of pancakes which were good, I like drowning my pancakes in syrup but decided to control myself and just accept the one 2oz container that came with the plate. I also added to eggs on the side which were fine but decided to get a chicken apple sausage and man I am hooked! I haven't stopped thinking about it since we left (don't tell my girlfriend), it sounded like a weird combination but for some reason it works and it works well! I got a cup of coffee and our waitress was on point with the refills. My girl got French toast with a country sausage and a side of hash browns. The side order of has browns were huge and all of her food also tasted great. Really looking forward to coming back and trying other things on their menu.",

Then another waitress comes and tells us they're completely out, so I also had to change my order. Hubby paid over $14 for the most bland omelette we've ever tasted. And my chicken sandwich was just okay. It was also very bland. The one yummy thing was the hash browns. And they have this great all natural ketchup. That was about it.   Also for a place called \"Matt's big breakfast\" you would expect something to be large about it. Not so much.   The only other upside was the waitresses are very nice and pretty attentive.",

The bacon that came with it was absolutely coated in coarse black pepper...not my thing at all. If I want pepper let me add it. I think this place is just \"a thing\" because it's busy and has a hipster draw to it. It's just not really a great breakfast diner. The service is decent and quick however. Don't understand why there is always a wait. This area must be starved for a variety of decent breakfast spots.",

    "text": "I have to say, I have never really been much of a breakfast person. With that said, Matt's Big Breakfast may change that. Why? Well, let's get crackin'! :)  The Food:  First and foremost, let's talk about the menu. It's small, but covers all you bfast must haves. Eggs to ham, oatmeal to waffles, they have you covered. They even have a big bowl of Frosted Flakes on the menu (ummmmm yum!). I got the Hog and Chick, which is two eggs any way, bacon or sausage, hashbrowns or homefries, with toast and homemade strawberry preserves. I got my eggs over easy, and I mention this becausemost places can't seem to make them right, but Matt's made them perfectly! The homefries were delish, and the toast and preserves made my tummy VERY happy.The only problem I had was with the bacon, too peppery. That is a personal preference though.   The Service: The service was good. It took about 30 min to be seated, which is to be expected. It allowed time for me to walk around a bit and chat it up with my friend. So no complaints there. Our server (and I feel terrible because I can't remember her name) was very sweet and attentive. Only towards the end did her service become slow, but the drinks and food came out in a respectable amount of time.   The Atmosphere: It is a smaller establishment, so its a little \"cozy\", but don't let that scare you away. Everyone is there to enjoy a good breakfast, so you're in good company. :) It's decor simple. It's pretty contemporary. It's very clean as well.   The Verdict: Matt's Big Breakfast is awesome! Worth the wait, and worth the trip downtown. I gave Matt's 4 stars because I wasn't a fan of the super peppery bacon, and the service got a little slow at the end. Other than those two, everything else was great! I will be returning, and with friends.",

It's just a unique waffle that is somewhere between a lolo version and a real Belgium variety. Just soft and buttery, a must try if waffles are or even aren't your thing. Only $7.50 for a filling meal, but you likely will have to wait, so try coming at some off peak hour. Park at deSoto market for free parking.",

Like 7 items for breakfast.  I was dubious...  Coffee - A+ - locally roasted by the Roastery of Cavecreek.  Fantastic! What a surprise and a delight!  Toast - A+ - artisan bread, very thick, with real butter.  We got the whole grain.  Amazing!j Oh - with homemade fresh preserves.  Hashbrowns - A+ - holy smokes, I don't know how they managed to take something so mundane and make it terrific.  Crispy, crunchy outside, softer on the inside without becoming mushy (retaining texture) and flavorful to boot!  Eggs - A - I can't really evaluate the eggs too much, because I put 'em on top of the hashbrowns and diced 'em up.  Service - B+ - Service was great - until the end when our guy left the check and dropped us like a hot potato.  I wanted more coffee.  They were SUPER busy, and scurrying all over.  I'll give them a B+ overall on service.  We even had an older guy check in on us to make sure everything was alright - like a manger or owner?  But ya gotta finish strong, too.  Paid our bill, and was able to get a small \"to go\" cup from the cashier.  That coffee was so delicious!  In the end, it was absolutely amazing to me that such simple familiar fare could be so outstandingly better than typical.  It really was quite a surprise.  I love breakfast at restaurants - probably my favorite meal of the day.  I SO MUCH WISH this place was closer to where I live.  This is what all restaurants aspire to be.",

Sat unacknowledged for a good 10 minutes before my server came, but was good after.",

It was still so busy but charming!   In general, everything here is good. They have different specials for each day so I always like to get that. However, this time I got the salami hash and hash brown. It was seriously so bomb! They use organic eggs and just organic everything. Food definitely taste fresh. I brought my boyfriend here to try my favorite breakfast place and he had no complaints either! He ordered a traditional breakfast plate and it came with eggs, sausage, hash browns, bacon, and toast. Oh my gosh, this hash brown is the best I have ever had. I almost forgot how good it tasted before going back this time! It was so crispy and not oily at all. I also want to rave about the toast here! It was just on point! I usually don't like toast but this one I could not pass.",

I am thankful for the storefront pictures on Yelp because we could easily drive by without realizing that was it. They had a nice parking lot behind which, when crowded, when it often is, can be hard to maneuver out because it only has one entry.  We were greeted and seated immediately! Yay for the early birds. The homemade preserves in the little cooler looked so appetizing. Our host graciously told us that when we got toast with our breakfast, a sampling of those preserves also came with our meal.  My husband and I enjoyed the daily special, the Chorizo Scramble. Because it came with a tortilla and not toast, we thought we'd better order toast and the preserves. No regrets! The toast and preserves were AMAZING! The sourdough toast was nicely buttered and crunchy. The preserves were just the perfect blend of tart and sweet. Our scramble was good. I loved my raspberry honey lemonade. It was heavenly. When I have a sore throat, can someone give me the recipe, pleeeease?  Everyone else polished off their breakfasts at our table. The consensus was the home fries were tastier than the hashbrowns. We will be back!",

I thought there was a big menu selection but there's only a few choices in the typical American breakfast categories. Prices usually range around 10-15 dollars. For that price I really hoped for better tasting coffee but it's your average typical coffee found in every Denny's. I ordered the basic breakfast (what my son calls a typical breakfast) 2 eggs, bacon, country potatoes and sour bread toast. My favorite thing on my plate was the sour bread toast! Fantastic! The bacon and potatoes do have their own unique favor. With strong hints of rosemary and black pepper.   Would I come back? Sure, if i was in the neighborhood and it was around a non peak hour. This place does seem to get a bit congested. Be willing to wait 15+ minutes for a table.",

Thankfully there was enough maple syrup to pour over. The atmosphere is nice, but very loud and hard to hear the servers. Service was good. Polite servers and staff.  I would go back for the coffee, but will try an egg dish next time.",

Gosh how I wish this place was just a little brighter, had a warmer feel to it & a little more decor. Everything else, as long as you're looking for a simple, chill vibe, was awesome.   We enjoyed the food so much that we went to MBB twice during our short stay in Phoenix. And I ordered the same thing both times... it was that good! Egg whites with chicken sausage and spinach... substitutes the salad with the hash browns. Perfect!  Work to the wise - get their hash browns. And get them extra crispy. So, so good!  The wait staff are all extremely gracious with coffee refills. As soon as you take two sips, there's someone at your table asking if they can refill your cup. I've had better coffee - it's not very strong, but, it gets the job done. All in all, I'd without a doubt recommend this place as an extremely satisfying breakfast!  Food: 5 stars Service: 5 stars Decor: 3 stars",

The sweetness of the sauteed onion mixed in with the home fries is the right amount of savory and sweet.  Ok, on a side note I do wish you guys would offer gluten free toast. It's your restaurant and your right to jump on the gluten free bandwagon or not. Clearly you have a huge following, but it could be bigger just by offering gluten free toast. Jewel's Bakery and Gluten Free Creations have wonderful options.....just a suggestion.",

    "text": "I have heard great things about Matt's Big Breakfast for a long time so this visit was long overdue. There are a few parking spots behind the building, otherwise there is plenty of street parking too. Arriving around 8am on a Saturday there were still a decent amount of open tables, we were told to seat ourselves and a server promptly came over to take care of us.   The menu isn't huge but the options all sound tasty. They have lunch selections after 11am. I started with an orange juice, which is fresh squeezed and soooo goood. I ordered the hog and the chick with 2 scrambled eggs, bacon, hash browns, and sourdough toast. My girlfriend got the waffle, which comes with a side of bacon and warm syrup.   I am not a huge breakfast food lover (I know, I know) but this was honestly so good. For the basic breakfast set up I enjoyed everything on my plate. The hash browns were actually crispy (most places never get this right), the bread and jam was perfect, the bacon is thick but has amazing flavor and the eggs are actual eggs. I stole my girlfriend bacon since she isn't a fan but I couldn't even finish it. Her waffle was really good but the syrup was a little too sweet for her. I thought it was an awesome combo though.   Our service was great, our table was a little wobbly and our server even stopped to fix it the second he noticed.   Overall it's a cute little spot with a great breakfast. I would love to try the other menu items and some of the specials!",

Ordered a side of the thick cut bacon which was great. One of my favorite parts was there Homemade spicy ketchup.

I was by myself and asked if I could take one of the five open bar seats. The host said yes. I tried to sit down. Then a server started screaming at me. So back to the host I went. I waited about five minutes for two top. So my visit started with a snag and I was annoyed enough I almost just left. I'm glad I didn't.   There aren't a ton of choices on the menu at Matt's. In some ways, Matt's is bare bones. This isn't a brunch place. It's more greasy spoon (my menu was caked in something and the table was sticky), with cage-free eggs, but what they do, they do well.   I got an omelet with mushrooms and onions and home fries. The omelet was great--the eggs were cooked perfectly. I loved the caramelized onion. The potatoes were overpowered by rosemary (I'd get hash browns next time), but they were also prepared well. The wheat toast and jam was good enough to be a meal on its own.   Service was fast and semi-friendly. For what it was, I was happy with my food.",

You can especially notice this in the hashbrowns, it's rich and very much melt-in-your-mouth. Whatever you do, get the hashbrowns!  Service was okay, they definitely have a lunch rush (I came at 1pm) so everything took a little longer than expected, and the place isn't decorated too nicely, just very simple but definitely clean.",

My group of four was in no hurry so we put our name in and tried to stay out of the way while being completely in the way.  At least 20 minutes before we were seated, but there was always another party getting called for a table - so it didn't feel long.   Our server was no barrel of sunshine, but she was busting butt (along with every other employee), so I didn't mind her lack of warmth.  She got us drinks promptly, and took our food order not long after.  As mentioned, this is a hustling, bustling place - so I wouldn't expect intimate conversation with table mates.  The food order came faster than waiting for our table, and it did not disappoint.  I had the five spot sandwich - egg, bacon, cheese on a bun I would eat plain.  Add some of their signature hot sauce and the happiness was on! I had a side of hash - crispy, salty = good.  My friends ordered the chick and hog - sourdough toast - oh boy it looked good - and was!  This is a no brainer for breakfast if you have the time.

Most of us had been up since 3:30AM this morning and my the time we got there(12pm), we were starving. We parked right in front and paid for the meter. The wait was about 10 mins or so to get a table and I already knew what I wanted: Eggs Benedict.  The eggs were cooked perfectly. Each cut into both of the Benedict's resulted in a river of Golden gelatinous egg. It trickled down into the alleyways of Pork Chop Canadian Bacon and funneled into the Sea of Hollandaise...Sauce. Ugh the sauce people. The sauce was so silky smooth. Add in a little of their hot sauce and I'm in heaven. What a perfect way to start my Vacation!   Oh!! Also try the Lemonade. It is friggin delicious. You can definitely taste the honey in each sip but still get the pucker you would expect from a good Lemonade. The first Breakfast spot in Arizona that we tried has made me hopeful for even more tasty food to come. Thank you Matt's for curing our itch for hunger this morning!!",

    "text": "Came here for breakfast on Saturday morning around 11. There was a 35 minute wait for 2 of us so we walked around a bit while we waited. Stopped into a coffee shop near by (FUTURO) it was a good find.    Once we were seated, we were greeted by friendly wait staff ready to get any drink orders. We got the chocolate milk which was great! The inside of the cup was lined with extra chocolate syrup which made it extra chocolatey and delicious.  We also ordered the pancakes, sourdough with preserves, and the five spot breakfast sandwich.   Everything we got was great!  For $6.50 the five sport breakfast sandwich is huge with perfectly cooked bacon and meaty cheese. My boyfriend deems the pancakes the best he has had in the Phoenix area which is quite the accolade since it's usually all he orders at breakfast spots.   The sourdough and preserves I ordered on a whim since yelp raves about it. I don't know how a simple toasted sourdough butter and preserves are so delicious but it really was worth the hype in my opinion.   Downfalls but not at all deal breakers:  1. the table we were at was wobbly - there were sugar packets shoved under on of the leg bases but it still wasn't working.  2. It was relatively noisy in there. Not bad for the two of us to hear each other but may have been more difficult for a table of 4+",

Came back and even though my name was already called, I was still the next one to be seated which is cool.   Took a couple pics of the ketchup bottle as I waited for my wonderful Saturday scramble special.   Got the scramble and it was worth the wait! They have specials every day which is awesome. On the chalk board is where the special is written out in detail of what it is.   The egg scramble came with a tortilla and really good and crispy hash browns. And the ketchup was soo good.  MBB knows what they're doing!   Pretty happy I got to try this place out before I head back home soon! Hopefully I'll be able to revisit once more and maybe even pick up a bottle of ketchup too.",

Don't get me wrong, I like healthy, but I also like carbs & maple syrup for brunch.  The place is cute with its own mini parking lot (or metered street parking.) It's a small to medium sized spot, we happened to stop by on a Friday around 1:00 with lots of open tables. I ordered the Vermont cheddar cheese omelette & rosemary potatoes, super simple I know, but damn that was some good cheese! Every bite I took had melty sharp cheddar, like yassssss!! & the potatoes! Don't even get me started. I don't think I've ever finished my potatoes at any breakfast/brunch restaurant.   My sister ordered the BLT, it was huge! It came with homemade potato chips, wowzers! The quality of all the food was so so so good! It's all HOMEMADE & fresh ingredients. Even the ketchup was homemade; I was a bit hesitant at first, not going to lie, but I tried it & it was actually very good!   I inhaled my food! I even ate all my sourdough toast with the homemade blueberry compote style jelly, practically licked the ramekin it came in. Don't judge me. I will definitely be coming back here next time I'm in AZ!",

I mean if Guy Fieri isn't normally a breakfast person but makes it a point to stop here when he's in town then it must be good! And we can fuuuur sure attest to that!  Everything about this place was awesome and all their food is made from scratch. Can you believe they don't own a microwave? So everything is truly cooked to order and it sure tasted like it!  His - Hog and Chick with Sausage patties, over medium eggs, hash browns, and sour dough toast. The hash browns were cooked to my perfection. The house made jelly that came with the toast was incredible and you can definitely tell it was made from fresh fruit.  Hers - Thursday's special of Eggs Benedict with a side of home fries aka breakfast potatoes. The hollandaise sauce was creamy with rich flavors!  We highly recommend this spot if you're in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area!",

    "text": "After a long night shift at work, bf and I decided to try this place, with all the great reviews, how can you go wrong?! Looking at the menu for a bit, I decided on the Pork chop and eggs. This is where I went wrong, I was extremely disappointed. For starters, I'm super happy it came out so quickly, but at the same time, that tells me it was cooked ahead of time-huge turn off. So I get my breakfast and was immediately turned off, my \"Iowa cut\" pork chop was about 1/3 the size of an Iowa cut chop. (Yes, I do realize that I am in Arizona, but I expect to get what I'm told I'm getting!) Next thing that caught my attention was the green color! I about sent it back, not sure what the green paste on it was, but it didn't taste as bad as it looked. Ok, as you can tell, I was very irritated with the pork, but moving on. Potatoes had too much Rosemary, I figured home fries were simply home fries, they were a sad example. Half of them were stale, the other half were mush. Eggs were done as asked, very happy with that. The toast and homemade Jam were awesome, but again, the bread was a bit stale...   The only reason that I didn't give this place one star, was my bf plate. He had the waffle with bacon and a side of sausage, simply AMAZING! Really wished I had followed my intuition and ordered that too!  Staff was very friendly and alert, made you feel like a home town type feel, however, I felt bombarded. Every time he took a drink of his coffee, we put our fork down, or even took a look around, they were at our table. I felt rushed and didn't appreciate the feeling much, they weren't busy, and had plenty of open tables...   Will try again, but certainly won't go back for the pork chops!!",

I've ordered breakfast dishes here before and I'm pretty sure they make it taste good by using a lot of butter and salt. There is nothing else unique about how they cook the food... It is very run of the mill. If you are a fan of bacon, it's pretty damn good. The orange juice is Freshly squeezed and SO delicious, and for that I'll give this place 3 stars...",

My dad and stepmom always want to come here when they are in town visiting and I definitely have no problem with that! I think I would go a lot more if I lived closer to downtown..this is more of a destination breakfast for us (but worth it). The hash browns that come on the side are sooooooo decadent and amazing. Probably the best hash browns I've ever had. There is always a wait but it goes by fairly quickly and there are a couple benches at the newer location so you can sit and wait. Five spot and hog & chick are notable faves. You won't be disappointed!",

Third, the food is beyond delicious. I ordered their breakfast sandwich, I couldn't even finish it all. They serve you huge portions here, so come with your appetite. Don't even get me started on the bacon; so fresh, juicy, and delicious. Overall this place just is amazing for breakfast. They have my business. Try them out!",

    "text": "This is my favorite breakfast spot in Arizona hands down! Every time I have visitors from out of town I suggest this for breakfast. Even when they were at the smaller location I would bring my friends from CA there when I used to live in downtown. I come here a lot with my man and the family and it is never disappointing. The prices are unbeatable for the quality of the food. My favorite item that they serve is their hash browns. I can't put my finger on what make them so delicious, they just are. My last visit they served us burned hash browns but they fixed it right away with the delicious hash browns that I love so much. I usually get some coffee and share a five spot with Eric. The five spot is an amazing breakfast sandwich that has thick bacon, egg, cheese and grilled onions all on delicious bread. When we have a crazier appetite we go for the five spot with an order of waffles. WOW. Unbelievably yummy. There's usually a wait but it's well worth it.",

That said, boy oh boy was it worth the extra 30 minute drive.  Everything was spot on.  The service, the food, the ambiance - just wow.  We got there close to closing time, so they were out of a few things, but that's to be expected when they're so busy.  Probably the best breakfast potatoes I've ever had - and the pancake is in the top three of all time.  Very few restaurants bother with real maple syrup, but for me it makes all the difference.  The bacon was up near the top I've ever had, and I will be back as often as possible.  Simply put, it's the best breakfast destination in Phoenix, period.",

My party and I arrived during the bustling Sunday brunch rush around noon and waited about 30 minutes for our table. When we arrived at our table we were greeted by a very attentive and soothing server and surrounded by a cozy yet comforting ambiance. Our server was fantastic in her suggestions on food choices and when my friend declined the toast that came with the meal, she suggested that we get it anyway as the bread is speculator. Our server was correct. The toast was thick, fluffy, and delicious with just the right amount of butter and a side of fresh in house strawberry preserve. The breakfast menu is limited to around 8 or 9 items but every dish we ordered was damn near perfection. I ordered the rib-eye and eggs and could not be more satisfied. The steak was juicy and seasoned with just enough to give a great flavor without being bland or overbearing. I will be coming back to frequent this wonderful restaurant for many a brunches to come. Well done Matt's Big Breakfast, well done!",

I don't know if he's the host or an owner or a manager...I didn't see any kind of name tag or anything. We walked in, stood there for a bit, then bald guy greeted us. We asked for a table for 2. He replied \"Ok...it'll be a bit of a wait.\" We asked about how long. He replied \"I really have no way to tell\". Seriously?? I mean, restaurants of all types and sizes have been giving approximate wait times since the beginning of time. You can't give me a ballpark? 5 minutes? 5 hours?? Something??? I was parked at a meter and had already paid for an hour so I decided to wait at least a little longer since parking was paid for. Had I been in a free parking place, we would have left for sure. We sat on a bench out front behind an old guy with a big fake boob lady whose backs were facing us...he kept putting his thumb inside her panties and molesting her butthole. They continued inside the restaurant as well. I'm sure this entertainment helped us pass the time, but unfortunately they probably aren't there all the time so your wait might be more boring.  Thankfully bald guy wasn't our server. We got Britney (dunno if it's spelled right, sorry!). Britney was fantastic. She was friendly (which is something I wasn't expecting because of reading other reviews while waiting for the...maybe 15-20 minutes it took for us to get a table.) She made great recommendations and was very prompt and pleasant. She is the only reason I give 3 stars instead of 1 or 2.  The food was...decent. The bacon was kind of thick and floppy for my taste. I like crispy bacon, but to each his own. The special was decent, the waffle was edible but not great by any means. The hash browns were delicious and tasted like buttery mashed potatoes inside. It was stuff I'd eat again but wouldn't see myself craving and traveling across town for.",

Where to start. ... Cold-reheated potatoes,  not just one of our plates but 2 of our meals came out like this ( we arrived right at 6:43am) expecting freshly made food first thing in the morning...followed by \"Center Cut Sirloin \" a.k.a. Hamburger Patty priced at $15.99 Daily Special.  Seriously guys, Dennys serves a better Sirloin Steak breakfast. Then seeing Costco \"Kettle Chips\" bags stacked in the open view kitchen and showing them on the menu as if they are something that was prepared there fresh. Lastly,  one of the male workers complaining about his work schedule to another in a very unprofessional manner,  in short form, I would not recommend spending  $58.00 for breakfast for 3 Adults and 1 child.... First and LAST visit my family will be making to this place.",

    "text": "So beyond sad that I have to write this review. I have been coming here off an on for a year... And today was my first bad expeirence but after reading some of the other reviews I don't think my expeirence is off par. I sadly won't be attending this establishment any more. It ties directly in with service and possibly the cooks... Normally its quite busy at lunch however I showed up at 11:15am so I think I beat the rush because I was able to sit down immediately. I asked the waitress how much just a side of one little pancake in addition to my meal would be and she said $3. I know the are a tad overpriced but for the healthier food on the menu I would pay that little bump in cost... not so much for little pancake. I ordered the special which was Eggs Benedict and asked that my eggs were cooked overhard. As I'm waiting for my food I realize that my water wasn't a fresh water (strange) it possibly was sitting out for awhile because it had 3 half melted ice cubes at the top (strange). So I asked for a fresh water which I felt like I was a bothersome. I received my food and took a big bite out of my eggs benedict only to realize that I was eatting a raw egg. I looked down and saw the dizzle of the yolk running down my food. Since my server didn't check on me after the fact, I motioned the first server I saw and told her I ordered it overhard and showed her the egg yolk. She looked a little dumbfounded and took my meal away. Returned shortly after with a new plate... or so I thought. Seeings how this was the special for the day I can only imagine that they had a big o pot of water in the back harvesting all these poached eggs. Well what they did with my eggs was throw the half eaten and the other poked egged into the pot because I received the same eggs I parted with earlier. I was so beyond hungry I just ate it. Luckily I have no dieases or anything that the next eggs benedict customer would be concerned with but still I'm a stranger... with my food all up on their food. I don't know doesn't sound appealing and makes me think what else do they do back there?! In addition, while eating my food, I ran out of water. No refill. Nobody came to check on me. No service. I didn't even get a bill. I had to walk up to the front to pay.   I did note that the owner who is usually there wasn't there this time. Not sure if that had anything to do with it this day. I just don't feel I was treated like a customer. Text my husband on the way out saying... well looks like I won't be back to matts big breakfast again... Overpriced food plus bad service... I rather go elsewhere.",

Friendly and competent :)  The food is delicious, as always. I had the Hog & Chick, which is 2 eggs, thick cut bacon & home fries. The eggs where just the right size (I was complaining about tiny eggs at another establishment earlier, lol), the bacon was perfect & my favorite part were the home fries, which were cooked to perfection. My daughter had the Waffle. I'd tell you how that was but she had inhaled it before I got a chance to taste it :D She told me it was really good & it's too bad I didn't get any, lol!  This time around my baby & I stopped in after hiking South Mountain. You know how some people look good no matter what they've been doing? That's not me, lol. But I have no shame, I stopped in anyway! You'll see all kinds here, people dressed to impress, some who look like they're headed to work, others who look like they're having a PJ party, some who look like they're going to or coming from the gym & then some who've just come off a mountain :D Regardless, it's one happy family here & there's a feeling of real camaraderie, all based around the love of fresh, yummy food!",

The area was not looking like there'd be a highly rated food place but bang, there it was. Nothing overly fancy from the outside but man the food does not disappoint. There's a decent selection on the menu and the prices are very reasonable.  No matter what you order, try the thick cut bacon. It's excellent.",

The wait wasn't too terrible for a Sunday morning after church.  My daughter's pancakes were fluffy and good.  Now for the not so great:  burned bacon, burned hash browns, dry overcooked pork chops, and my scramble was watery because they didn't saute the jalapenos first to  get the water out of them.  When I'm paying $100 (including tip) for breakfast for 6 people, I expect a higher level of cooking skill than I can achieve in my own kitchen.  We weren't coming back anyway, but the noise level added to everything else guarantees it.  They are very big on fresh, local, and cruelty free ingredient sourcing, which is fine, but I think you pay for that gimmick much more than the cooking skill.",

In fact, I expected us to wait before being seated.   The daily special ran out right after I ordered and lot of the things were out by 11am. I understand the business is doing well but you really cannot allow things to run out more than few hours before close! Sad. So instead of the pork chop and the daily special, we opted for the waffles and the 'new - updated' daily special.   I guarantee that this place is much better than Denny's. It's ludicrous to compare Matt's to Denny's. Sure it may look similar but the quality of the ingredients and the dishes themselves speak for themselves. But, to me, Matt's wasn't all that special. Perhaps all the hype and media have changed the restaurant a little bit? Who knows..",

The only positive is that our wait was short and the food came to the table in a timely manner. I ordered the Hog & Chick with bacon, over easy eggs, and home fries . The bacon was incredibly overcooked and splintered into individual fibers in my mouth. I've completely burned bacon before and it tasted better than this. The eggs had no flavor and were somehow watery. The home fries were decent, but there were multiple, half inch long Rosemary stems in  the way which provided a challenge to eat around. Final point of contention is that nothing can be subbed. I have a gluten intolerance and asked if anything could be subbed for the toast that came with the meal...nope. I get that some restaurants think gluten intolerance is a bunch of hoo ha and don't want to cater to that particular group of eaters, but in my thinking, as long as the sub is of equal or lesser value to the toast, why not? Matt's clearly doesn't agree. Regardless, I don't believe I shall return. No big loss.",

    "text": "Okay. So my sister mentioned she saw this on Diners, Drive-ins and Dives. It wasn't the same spot, as they had moved from the original location to open up a larger restaurant. The back lot parking is tiny and awkward, since you'd have to back out of it to get out. But, there is plenty of street parking.   We showed up on a Saturday morning, after a walk through the nearby farmers market. The wait wasn't all that long. It was only 15 minutes for us, as we were here at about 9:30am. But, it got pretty crowded when we left.  As for all the great reviews, hrmmm... Overall, I think the food is just average. My parents got the griddlecakes, bacon and eggs. My sister got the porkchops with homefries. I ended up getting eggs, sausage, hash and toast. The parents griddlecakes were huge. They could have easily split them to share. I snagged a piece of bacon and found it quite tasty. The hasbrown was kinda overcooked, almost to the point where it was sorta burnt. Not quite, but almost. Some nice soft, white bits in my hashbrowns would have been nice. The toast was pretty chewy and took some teeth gnawing action, in order to swallow. My sister's porkchops and homefries were just okay. Though the chops look like they were seasoned with something, it wasn't all that flavorful and a bit dry.  The servers were friendly and prompt. They were quick to refill drinks. The only notable thing that stuck out was that they were sitting 3 people at what I would consider a 2 person table. A bit of a tight fit there with all the knee bumping action going on.  The place is good. It's just not great. Definitely nothing spectacular.",

    "text": "We were visiting Phoenix and stumbled upon this gem on Yelp! It's located downtown but parking is not inconvenient at all; there is a small lot or metered street parking, which seemed ample even during the lunch rush. We arrived around 11:30 on a Friday afternoon. The restaurant was fully sat but no one was waiting in front of us. We had a party of 6 and I would recommend to try to keep your group small. This is a very quaint little space with limited room for large groups. It's only a one room restaurant. That being said, we waited about 25 minutes (which we were accurately quoted).  We sat down and were greeted promptly. Long story short, the service was friendly and the food was amazing.   Highlights:  -Iced coffee: I almost never order iced coffee in breakfast restaurants because it is almost always completely diluted by the melted ice. Here, they anticipate this and double-brew their iced coffee which leaves it tasting extremely bold (like a cold brew).   -Apple juice: seems like a weird thing to choose as a highlight, but it was so fresh and I believe cold-pressed!   -Strawberry honey lemonade. So refreshing in the heat.   -Chicken Apple sausage: just omg. Must try.   -Rosemary potatoes: life-changing. No one at the table could stop raving about them!   Also, the gentleman greeting and coordinating the seating was friendly and helpful. The owner also stopped by the table which I thought was a nice touch.   I would definitely recommend this place! You won't regret it. The menu is a little small but only because they take so much pride in the things they do serve.",

I leave food on my plate almost every time as I am stuffed.   Two areas to be prepared for are: 1) to wait outside in the phoenix desert heat to be seated, this is the rule; the exception is walking straight in and being seated. 2) The restrooms are there but the only hold one person at a time. If you got to go you may wait again in line.!In the men's restroom they have a toilet and urinal but no divider, so it's one at a time. Can't speak on the ladies as I am not one nor am I a pervert.

Maybe it's because airport food is never as high quality as outside food, I'm not entirely sure.   We had the Sonrisa Burrito, which was decent. I liked the thin tortilla that they used and the salsa was a nice addition, but the burrito was very oily and dripped a ton as we ate it. Their potatoes were also undercooked and had a weird texture to them...   I'm usually a huge fan of breakfast burritos, but I wish I had skipped Matt's Big Breakfast and tried Sweet Republic next door at the terminal (even if it was 10 in the morning!).",

She said waffles. Definitely the waffles. I RARELY order or eat waffles. I don't know why. I just don't. They were awesome and hit the spot! The bacon was thick cut, crisp, and flavorful.

My husband had pancakes and bacon. The pancakes were really good which is why I gave 2 stars instead of 1. The bacon had a lot of pepper which we didn't know it had pepper at all. The orange juice was fresh squeezed which was the one good review I could give. I don't know if it was a fluke that we had a bad experience, but we will not be going back. We spent almost 40 dollars and I couldn't eat most of it. I would prefer to go to Denny's!!",

We arrived at about 10 AM on a cool December morning and upon arriving we we noted that the area outside the restaurant was surrounded by potential patrons.  After putting our name on the list for a table we patiently waited fr 40 minutes for a table. With a wait like this I expected something over the top in a breakfast meal.  When we obtained our table it was in a small room with 2 refrigerators a prep table and cleaning sink.  Not much for ambiance, but, I needed to see the food and the presentation.  I ordered the waffle special and others ordered egg meals. I was somewhat amazed at the small serving size of the waffle which was about 6 inches in diameter.  The side was 2 slices of bacon.  The egg dishes were nothing out of the ordinary and were similar to what I cook up in my kitchen. Prices were average for a breakfast establishment.  Serves was a shining star for the establishment.  Our staff was great once we got into the restaurant.   Bottom line...This is a tourist destination made popular by a media celebrity.  As a local, I would not make the trip again to this place. in their defense, they have other locations in the area and I have not visited those to determine if the quality of food was any different.    If in the area and you want to make  the trek to downtown Phoenix and say you've been there, enjoy.",

The waffle was one of the best that I've ever had. The bacon was tasty and I enjoyed every bite of my meal. The strawberry honey lemonade is great to have as well. It is a bit noisy inside, but you barely notice it when chowing down on the delicious food.",

The chicken breast was delicious. Pesto seasoned just right on a soft bun and very filling. The chip and chop was also good but the portion size left you wanting more.  The butter burger patty was cooked to order and very filling. The chill was amazing!! The bummer was that it was served warm. They had a yummy blue raspberry lemonade. The service was quick and friendly except our waitress who looked like she was pissed.  Not a friendly person at all. The bus boy should be promoted to waiter he had the perfect personality.  All in all it was a good experience and I would have given it 5 stars if our waitress was better.",

This place serves the perfect post-shift breakfast, which means that it also probably serves the perfect post-binge hangover food too.  Coffee is diner-style, with frequent visits from friendly waiters bearing big pots of coffee, and the Five Spot consists of a perfect-sized breakfast sandwich with thick-cut bacon and delicious eggs.  Even better, the price for that sandwich is equivalent to one from most fast-food restaurants.  You may have to wait a little bit for a brunch table on the weekends, but that only attests to the quality of the food.  Matt's Big Breakfast makes me look forward to overnight shifts.  That's one of the highest recommendations I can give.",

    "text": "Its been a long time since my last visit to Matt's.  I used to make the pilgrimage pretty regularly to their old location, but hadn't taken in the new place.  Boy, what an upgrade.  Their old place was essentially a shack that (somehow) managed to cram about 20 people inside.  It was a cool place and was unique to the neighborhood, but it was really crowded inside and the wait times could be epic.  The new place is roomier, can seat twice as many patrons, and feels much more like a neighborhood restaurant than a corner hole in the wall.  The wait outside can still be long at times, but at least now you won't feel as cramped inside as you do waiting in line.  Not wanting to wait in line, but wanting a hearty breakfast, I came here at about 7am on a Saturday.  Just came by myself and grabbed a stool.  My server told me its usually just after 8am on Saturday that it gets busy and the lines start to form.  So my timing was perfect.  Even at 7am the place was a little over half full, but no wait time.  The patrons I saw ran the gambit from families with kids, to ASU Downtown students, to workers in suits, to neighborhood artists.  Similar to what I remembered at Matt's old place.  For my meal, I went with the Salami Scramble.  Molinari salami mixed with scrambled eggs and accompanied by toast with homemade strawberry preserves and hash browns (you can substitute home fries if you want).  To wash it all down I went with their fresh squeezed lemonade mixed with honey.  Unusual drink mixing the sweetness of the honey with the acidic taste of the lemonade, but very good.  The scramble was incredible as the salami had just the right amount of kick, wasn't oily and they didn't skimp on the salami portions.  The strawberry preserves tasted very fresh and accompanied the sourdough toast perfectly.  Total cost for the scramble and sides, lemonade, tax, and tip was $15.  Good deal given the hearty portions I received in return.  The server was very friendly and the staff were all alert, attentive, and in good spirits even this early on a Saturday morning.  As with their old location, the detractors would probably tell you the biggest negative about this place is the wait.  Even now that they have a new location twice as big as the old one, the wait can still get long.  Take it from the waitress I talked to, get here before 8am if you can.  I did and was in and out in 30 minutes.  Matt's has a following for a good reason.  Great portions of hearty, locally sourced food at reasonable prices.  A legion of fans will tell you its worth the wait.  Count me among them.",

Thick wide slices of sweet peppery bacon which had less fat. Oh my, the home fries. Chunks of potatoes with onions, some with crispy edges, some without. Thick slices and of sourdough toast with delicious butter served with blueberry preserves. It seemed as if the blueberries were picked yesterday. And not too sweet. The perfect breakfast to say the least. The guy next to me had the Sirloin steak that he said was fabulous. I also ordered the Strawberry Lemonade. I almost drank the whole glass full on my first sip. Go there you will not be disappointed. All fresh local food.",

However, for all the wait, including the hour wait outside the restaurant, it was a \"meh\" kinda place. The waitress in front was great with remembering the parties in line, and keeping you updated so we didn't have to be that annoying couple that keeps looking at her and her list to see how many people in front before us.   Once seated, the busboy brought out 2 plates, one which had old crusty food on it. I asked if I could have another plate because it was dirty, showed him, and then he used his finger nail to pick it off in front of us! Then handed the plate back down. Alright I get this is a diner, but still....your finger nails are not clean! and watching you pick off the food does not make me feel any better. I think he realized his disgusting behavior because after that he asked if I wanted another plate. It's fine I said, just praying I don't get gastrointestinal issues from it!  For breakfast, we shared the five spot, and the pancakes with a side of his famous hashbrowns. The portions are large, but the food was average. The five spot breakfast sandwich was tasty, with thick slices of bacon. But it was okay, nothing to wait an hour for. The hashbrowns were mushy consistency, not the crusty deliciousness Guy made it seem like. And the pancakes were good but again just average.",

The home fries are seasoned with rosemary and taste great.  The much-hyped bacon really is good... it's the right balance between chewy, fatty, and crispy.  Eggs are always cooked up well and the portions are a decent size.  The coffee is good too.  The sandwiches for lunch are good too, and the BLT is the standout.  I've actually taken to ordering home fries instead of chips to go along with my lunches.  The only real downside i can think of is that it's sometimes packed, and it can be a  wait to get a table.  When it gets like this, the staff naturally tries to turn over their tables quickly.  It's good because the food comes out lightning fast, and good because your wait to get a seat isn't too long!  But it's not so great when you feel rushed.  That said, this is a really good breakfast, a solid lunch, and well worth a shot if you haven't been here before.  This isn't just Guy Fieri hype... it's good food and one of the better breakfast places in the Valley.",

Both the honey lemonade and the fresh-squeezed orange juice should be sipped like fine wine. Go here. Bring someone with you so you can steal food from them. Seriously.

The novelty factor going on is a play on the word \"big.\"  But it's not big servings, it's odd cuts.  Instead of 2 slices of toast, you get a single slice that's about an inch thick.  Three strips of bacon that are about double thickness.  To me it was just novelty though, there's a reason toast isn't that thick and bacon is usually sliced thinner.  When it's cut this way the toast was just a bit too much like a mouth full of bread, and the bacon was chewy, not crispy.  On the positive side, the hashbrowns were great, the over easy eggs were done perfectly, the waitress was very friendly, and the service was amazingly fast (Tuesday Morning, 7:30AM).  I'd consider going back for the service alone.  But I wasn't a fan of the food.  It was fairly average, which I guess is impressive for novelty size/slice items?  But I don't get how this can be getting so many 5 star ratings for being great service but otherwise just high priced novelty food.",

We were there fairly early on a Saturday morning and really did not expect this many people downtown for breakfast.   Decor was mostly just a large room with a small room and tables.  I am one or the people that say it is pretty hard to mess up breakfast. I am pretty much an egg, bacon, toast person. But there are many things you can do to make this breakfast great.  The eggs were cooked just perfect, the beacon was thick and taste, the potatoes were different from what I expected and were great, now the toast. I usually get rye toast as I did this time. Surprise it was marble rye. My favorite. This is the only place I Have ever gotten it at breakfast. My wife got the same breakfast only with sourdough and scrambled eggs.  The food was very good. The service was OK. I know there was a lot of people waiting to eat. I felt rushed.  When I am in the area at breakfast time I will be stopping in for a meal.",

    "text": "Finally getting time to get down to write the review for this gem of a breakfast/lunch spot. Its places like this that make me want to move more and more to downtown Phoenix.  Ive been here a few times already and I try something new every time. I do have to say that the steak and eggs has been the fav thus far. A True man's man meal meant to satisfy that inner lumberjack. They cooked the steak just the way I like it which rarely happens. Unless you go to some pricey steak house, they always like to cook well done or still moving. Not Matts I washed it down with their  absolutely refreshing, fresh squeezed oj. Even their toast and jam was addicting. Breakfast has to be my favorite meal of the day, so a ideal breakfast spot is key. Matts has secured its way as a top performer in that category.  Moving past the enticing grub at Matts, the customer service was excellent. The place always seems busy driving by but when you go in, they usually get you in right away. The staff is more than friendly and always checking to make sure your dining experience is great. The joint is small but put together very well with a vintage, yet modern vibe. Watch out when you first sit down though, Its like planting your ass on the toilet in winter. Seats are metal so it takes a minute to warm up.",

Coming here, I wasn't sure where to park & I couldn't find a parking spot so I parked at the visitors parking lot right beside the old Matt's big breakfast ($4 for 2 hrs). The wait was not bad, we waited for 20 mins. for a group of 7. When we were inside, the noise level was very loud, it was busy. Our table & chairs was set up really close together with the other tables so there's no room, we can't extend our feet and arms. I have no where to put my purse so I hanged it on my chair. I ordered the Hog & chick, it was very delicious. The hash browns were crispy, bacon was thick and yummy, my egg whites were perfect and my sourdough toast was very good with their home made jam! I also tried their freshly squeezed orange juice, i love it! it was not too acidic! Service was good they keep up with refilling our drinks and if we need anything else. I love everything!",

    "text": "so we came here on a Thursday morning and were able to sit right down which was nice compared to the upwards of two hour wait on our first attempt to come here. Like many we saw the restaurant on TV and thought we check it out given the hype. The menu is pretty limited and it was more than a little loud on the inside but overall kind of your typical hipster downtown location for anything in America.    Instead of your normal diner fair which is kind of what we were expecting there was a lot of nicer styles of foods with definitely a direction towards local and organically grown which is a nice refreshing change. Service was OK as they were definitely moving people in and out.  Ordered the salami scramble and home fries and it was on point. My wife ordered the waffle which was decent.  Had iced tea because that was the most appealing on the menu for a beverage and we got one refill in spite of servers walking by repeatedly most notably one particular blonde female that just kept walking and staring at my empty glass. Overall the staff seem to be pleasant but seem to want to move bodies in and out rather than provide customer service.  Our server for example took our order and that was the last we saw them until it was time for the check.  The food is great and that's the reason why it is scoring as high as it is (wanted to go with a 2).  Service was timely but impersonal.  Clearly they have changed the menu from when they were on television which is neither good nor bad as again the food was great (at least mine was).  I don't see coming back again anytime soon but I will say that I highly recommend the salami scramble with home fries.",

OJ was 4.50 for 12 oz. They do use maple syrup, but honestly it tasted like any other pancake syrup. Pancakes were dry as I really didn't want to pay extra. This is the first review I have ever written...downloaded yelp today. I feel this strongly about reviewing this place. Very disappointed. I feel like price wise they are like an expensive steak house where you are nickel and dimed to death. Not at all worth it. Just my humble opinion. Sorry, not usually one to complain...",

I always drink water and as soon as I ordered mine, the girl just walked off as if she was annoyed at me not getting a juice. I ordered two entrees and my mother ordered one. My mother ordered a cheese omelette and was asked for the type of cheese, the style of toast, and which side preferred. I got the pancakes (called something else) and the 5 spot which had grilled onions, bacon, and egg. As soon as I said the 5 spot, she started to walk away with no questions. I asked how the eggs were and changed that, then I said I also wanted the pancakes. As a server as well, I thought this was kinda passive aggressive when I hadn't been even slightly rude. She wrote it down and walked off. After our food arrived the 3 large pancakes were served with one small butter slice on the very top and that was all. On the side was about 1.5 ounces of syrup that would've covered half of one pancake. I ate the 5 spot first while waiting for our server to come check on us so I could ask for more syrup and butter. She never came till I finished that and I had to look around as if I needed something till someone saw me. She came over and I told her I'd like more butter and syrup. Her words were \"the butter is free but the syrup will be $1.50 more.\"  I asked why they are serving 3 huge pancakes with that little syrup and charging for more syrup when you can't eat pancakes without syrup. She replied \"because it's real maple syrup and they make us charge\". It's not her fault I suppose but if I'm paying $8 for pancakes, what good are they without syrup?! I should've sent them back right then but I didn't want to be rude. It's just not a place I'll ever return to or recommend to anyone.",

OR there shouldn't even be any charges cause it is a breakfast place!",

Got the breakfast special-scrambled eggs with spinach and sausage. Hash browns were a little different, Kinda mushy. I will be trying the country potatoes next time. Friend had the salami scramble. Also delish! And good size portions! We had left overs to take home.    Will be back for sure!",

    "text": "Definitely not worth the wait.    55 minute wait of close to in order to have been given the waitress Allison and her sour mood.  Never once smiled, did not bring the order correctly (and when I mentioned it, she rolled her eyes and smacked her gums as if I was the problem.  I said I have a pork and berry allergy (so please no jelly) and I did check to see if they used different pans and cooked on different grills.  My food came with Jelly; and as I said when I mentioned it to her; chomped her gums and rolled her eyes.  The nicest person in the place was the man whom was cleaning tables.  He was constantly smiling and just a great aura about him.  The GM I am guessing was nice enough to come ask me how extreme an allergy was.  IT IS AN ALLERGY and if I AM SAYING SO, must be EXTREME!  My dates food came, mine came roughly 7-9 minutes after; I am glad she did not wait or hers would be cold.  I had an open face cheese omelet as when you walk in the door you see their staff checking other omelets with a  fork on the window sill and then putting it back - to then check another one.  To me that is a bit gross and with a food allergy (thus me asking for open face), it concerns me.  Cheese omelet should have been called open face greasy melt...  Lastly, one other gross thing that caught my attention.  The man collecting payment, he touches money (counting it as well as collecting from patrons, credit cards and the such, even picked up trash from the floor; then turns to the window and brings food to a table.  Never once in my 1.25 hours there did I see him wash his hands or leave the floor.  They will not go broke do to my one post - yet if it helps one person - then I am glad.  I would not go back, service sucked other then GM, food was second rate, and wait time - not worth it.",

We got to sit at the cute table in what looked like their front area that doubles as a prep kitchen.   We did have to wait a few minutes to get drinks, seemed to be last on the waitresses priority list. Over all service wasn't stellar, but the food was great so I didn't mind much. My brother did enjoy his strawberry lemonade tremendously, if I am correct it is house made lemonade and homemade strawberry preserves added. Looked yummy!  I got a traditional 2 eggs over medium (made perfectly! just runny enough with no snot on the whites), hash-browns and bacon. The bacon is awesome! thick cut and peppery!  A few others got their special that day, eggs and churrizo and a tortilla, wow so good! Not too spicy and tons of flavor!  Matt's is pretty darn good!",

I found out about this place from Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives and had to try the famous Chop & Chick. Splitting this between two people and then adding a side of the chicken apple sausage was definitely enough for both of us!   Although the service from Gabby was great, I was a little disappointed with the size of the pork chop. It wasn't as big as I was expecting, but it was still delicious.   All in all, I will still recommend this place to anyone that comes to Phoenix. I'm kicking myself now that I didn't get more sourdough bread for the road because it was that awesome.",

Whenever we have to drive up to or through PHX from Tucson, we stop here. We go without eating breakfast, drive the 2 hours, wait in line and eat here. It's just that good.   This place is simple. The frills* are few but they make a hard impact. The thick-cut sourdough toast with super excellent fresh homemade jam (*frill). The rosemary (*frill) on the home fries. SIMPLY delicious.  My go to is the 5 Spot (breakfast sandwich with egg, melty cheese, GRILLED ONIONS (*frill), and thick-cut bacon, and one pancake on the side (real butter, real syrup *frills).   For the two of us to eat here: full breakfasts with coffee, it's under $30. The wait on the weekends for two is usually 30 minutes, so not bad for regular breakfasters like us.   Seriously, the food is so fresh and that's just what makes it so good. The staff is so efficient and extra friendly. We always have so much fun and such a good meal here. This is a place where we will always visit as much as we can.",

My mind thinks breakfast at any time of the day or evening is a perfect choice so why not at least give this place a quick once over...  Interesting menu...the pork chop catches my eye so hey, why not, lets give this a go. It came out to the table in 5-minutes...steaming hot, with my eggs scrambled lightly as I asked, breakfast potatoes....I would have preferred hash browns, but these were good...toast, and one huge pork chop...awesome.  My eggs were perfect, and the potatoes were perfect as well, and the toast...I ordered rye, but didn't expect to get TEXAS rye toast...LOL, these were huge slices...buttery and quite tasty....and that pork chop...it was amazing, thick cut, minimal fat around the edges...bone in, and so moist and tasty.  What a real surprise finding this place...good service, excellent food, and the price...$9 I think....incredible.  Definitely earned a 4-star, perhaps a 5-star after a few more visits...in any event, a good experience all the way around. And speedy...in an airport waiting for your flight or making a connection, you don't have much time to sit around waiting for a server, food or a check when your meal is all done...this place was conscious of that requirement and did a great job. I will be back...I hope to see you there...!!!",

    "text": "After a late incoming flight and not much sleep, I woke up hungry and needing caffeine in the worst possible way. When my sister woke up we began exploring breakfast options before heading out for a hike. She mentioned this place and a few others but this one was the only one I had Bookmarked on Yelp and I'd really hate to waste all my research time. So we loaded up and arrived around 9am and there was already a 30-minute wait--ordinarily I would've gone elsewhere but I was on vacation and the weather was perfect so we just chilled. Almost 30-minutes to the T we sat down and ordered our repast.   Coffee- I thought it was pretty standard diner coffee; nothing good but nothing great. Apparently they sell bags of it to take home if you really find yourself enamored with it. 3*  Bacon- Pretty amazing tasting bacon--might be the best I've had at a breakfast place. It's thick-cut and loaded with pepper and you can tell it's high quality stuff. 5*  Sausage Patties- Pretty good homemade sausage patties that had some nice spice to them. 3.75*  Waffle- My sister jocks their Waffle pretty hard and after having a taste I can see why. It's light, crisp and has a terrific Buttermilk flavor. She eats it without syrup (heresy, I know), but I can see why.  4.5*  The Chop and Chick- This breakfast comprised of two Eggs over-medium, bone-in Pork Chop, Country Potatoes and Sourdough toast. The eggs were cooked perfectly; the potatoes were great and I really liked the Rosemary they put with them; the Sourdough was hearty, but nowhere on the level of SF Sourdough; and the Pork Chop was cooked well and left a bit pink--the way pork should be. My only qualm was that everything was served with very little to no salt on it; which is fine, I suppose, because I'd rather it be under than over. 4*  Blueberry Jam- This came with the Sourdough Toast and it really deserves its own special category because Matt's really outdoes themselves with it. Maybe the best blueberry jam I've ever had--not too sweet and tremendous blueberry flavor. 5*  Service & Ambiance- Really good and friendly service that kept my coffee cup full and checked on us frequently. Matt's looks a lot bigger inside than does outside and has a modern-industrial feel to it. 4*  Value- Everything is very reasonably priced as none of our dishes cost more than $10; compared to the Bay Area this is an outstanding value. 5*  Matt's is a terrific Diner that offers top quality food; fast and good service; and is value priced. I'd probably rate it at a solid 4.5-stars but I'll round it down to four because the underseasoned breakfast was a bit annoying. Other than that it's highly recommended if you're in the Downtown Phoenix area!",

I recommend going on Sunday for their steak and eggs, the hash browns are amazing, and the steak is a much better quality than I thought we'd get.   Only downside is that they don't split checks, I totally get it, but when you visit their Tempe location, it doesn't make sense to not split checks since they are in a work campus for Statefarm.",

    "text": "I like that they use local farm products and some of the stuff is organic. The strawberry honey lemonade was different and good. I got the hog and chick breakfast - eggs were great, hash browns were super greasy, but spot on with the texture and taste. I prefer crispy bacon, which this wasn't but it had a good flavor. And the strawberry preserves on the white sourdough toast were excellent. I like that they have different specials every day of the week, so I need to come back and try the eggs Benedict, French toast, and biscuits and gravy at some point!  Very tasty menu and a cute little place.  There wasn't much of a wait - and the service was quick so that was nice.",

Plan on getting here early or waiting a bit because it is not the largest restaurant and it gets very busy during peak times. They have always changing lemonade flavors that are fresh and delicious as well as daily food specials. This past visit I tried the \"hog and chick\" which comes with two eggs, either country sausage or super thick cut bacon, and either hash browns or breakfast potatoes and toast. The sausage comes in link or patty form, I ordered the patty form and made a little breakfast sandwich out of the ingredients. The five spot breakfast sandwich is always a great value for only $5.95. If you have some time stay around for lunch, the butter burger and macaroni salad are out of this world!",

Your hospitality and generosity opened the door to visit you all week during our stay in Phoenix. I have always had a tendency to support local restaurants and the quality/engaged service you provided made our group feel comfortable.   The items that I order included were the amazing & fresh pancakes (Monday), Waffles (Tuesday) & Bacon, French Toast (Wednesday), Chops & Potatoes (Thursday) and Waffles & Bacon (Friday). I can honestly say that I did not have a favorite breakfast.... they were all amazing in their own right. Fresh thick bacon and divine rosemary potatoes were amazing and the strawberry honey lemonade made my time away from home worthwhile.   By the way, I am still shaking my head at the separate check/separate payment method confrontation that occurred between my collague and your owner on the final day of our stay yet since I am choosing to leave it to it being a simple miscommunication, I am rating you on the entirety of the visit.  Thank you again for doing such a fantastic job!",

Potatoes had rosemary in them which I'm usually not a fan of but I actually liked it this time. Hubby had a waffle which I took a bite out of (of course) and it was delish.

Honestly. You know it's a a good spot when it starts getting full on a monday morning.   First things first, if you can find parking on the street. Do it. You'll probably thank me later. The restaurant has a tiny parking lot in the back, but it's so tiny that you pretty much have to back your way out. Just save yourself the headache.   As for the food, amazing! The breakfast menu is not the most extensive, but it has all the right stuff. Omelets, pancakes, waffles, oatmeal, you name it.   Since I'm such a bore when it comes to my food, I opted for the cheese omelet with a side of home fries and wheat toast. The omelet was cooked to perfection. But I have to admit; the country potatoes and homemade strawberry jam were the best part of the experience. Who would have known?!  Definitively will come back next time I'm in town.",

We got in on a Thursday afternoon and there was probably only a 10 minute wait. We started off with their highly recommended lemonades (me with strawberry, boyfriend with blueberry). For the main dish I got their homemade belgian waffle with bacon and my boyfriend got the chop and chick with bacon on the side. We shared half of each dish with each other and both dishes were great! I was a huge fan of the pork chop and rosemary potatoes that came with his chop and chick. The belgian waffle is also a must-try; it was very fluffy and just the right portion size. It is divided into four chunks so it is easy to share.  Service is fast and friendly here. Everything is reasonably priced as well! With our drinks and dishes, our bill came out to be around $35ish from what I can recall. This is a great spot in Phoenix to try for brunch, either at this location or at the airport if you happen to catch it there as well!",

The pancakes were really hot, which melted the REAL butter perfectly and was served with hot 100% maple syrup.  So good.  The sausage patties were generous (probably 8oz total), uniquely spiced and delicious.  Coffee was great and refilled regularly, which means service was excellent.  My brother in law had the special - a spicy Mexican egg combination with lots of jalapenos, spicy chorizo and cheese. He only had good things to say.  My sister had bacon and eggs, over easy - eggs cooked perfectly.  The bacon was really peppery and thick - yummy if you like peppery bacon.  At any rate, we had a great, big, breakfast - really recommend this cheerful, tasty little establishment!",

If you come here with a party of four your tab would be close to $80.  $4.50 for a large OJ that was probably bought at Costco for $5 a gallon!?  Food is good, but not worth the high cost  and wait considering the location is in an industrial area.  I have been to hundreds of restaurants world-wide and know what is a reasonable cost for your meal.  Diners and Dives made it popular, but now I think they are gouging the customer for their product.  Cashier tried to justify costs, but the #s just don't add up.",

I might have to update this after going a few more times but first impressions were very good. I don't know what else I can say that hasn't already been said. This place has been on every \"watch someone else eat\" food show around and been reviewed a hundred times over. I am told this is their new slightly bigger location. It was very nice. We did have to wait until all of our party showed up to be seated. Which ended up being 14 strong when it was all said and done. Once we were officially on the list the wait wasn't too long and they had put together a few tables to seat all of us together. Due to the noise level inside the waiter addressed each end of the table separately so he didn't have to yell across the table. Drink orders were taken and soon after water and other drinks started to come out. Two people went around the table getting food orders. I had to get the griddlecakes even though the egg scramble with chorizo special was very tempting. I came for pancakes and that was what I was sticking to. Now I thought the food came out fairly quickly unless I was just caught up in conversation which is known to happen at the Breakfast Club. So many great people to talk to. My griddlecakes were awesome. Some of the best I've had ever. My one small complaint was extra syrup is $1.50 and I love a lot of syrup on my pancakes. But it was worth it because it was real maple syrup and the pancakes were so good. I finished off the entire stack of three pancakes which I'm told is quite a feat as they are big and rich. I was hungry and was determined to make it through. They didn't split the check but let each of us pay our share and in the end it was all taken care of. I will definitely be back to try all of the other stuff on the menu which is why this review may or may not change. I hope it doesn't because based off the pancakes alone this place is one of the best and deserves all of the attention and the line outside to get in. Can't wait for the next Breakfast Club \"meeting\".",

The fresh squeeze OJ is awesome but be ready to drink some thick pulp. I like it but I'm sure it can be a shock for the american taste of the shitty artificial juice that they have us so used to.  The waffle was pretty good. The bacon was crisp and full of flavor.  I ordered eggs with the rosemary fries and bacon. Those fries worth the trip!  Cheers!  PS Great service",

I understand that waiting for a seat can be long but it is worth the wait.    I know the new place has been open for awhile but I love it!  Bigger location but still the great food and friendly staff!  I am just drooling over the thought of the Belgium waffle with REAL maple syrup and BACON!  All of my favorite foods on one plate.  The Chicken Sandwich with pesto, provolone and peppers is the juiciest sandwich I have ever tasted.  The peppers are not on the usual sandwich. I believe it was the lunch special.  Matt's is a fixture in Phoenix and they are here to stay.    I wish I could give you more stars!!",

    "text": "A Big Breakfast with a small menu!  Note: this review is for the vegetarian options.  Small, cute restaurant in the middle of a neighorhood area that ALWAYS seems to have a line. Words of advice- WAIT. IN. THE. LINE!   Service- we sat at the bar, which isn't huge (I think there were between 12-15 stools), and the  server was very friendly, very helpful, and very nice. Our food was brought out promptly, water was refilled before we could get close to finishing, and we were checked up on every 5 minutes. 5 stars.  Atmosphere- Really cute place that's always full. It's not huge, but it's not tiny either. Everyone seems to be in a good mood, and its a wonderful BRUNCH location. It's fairly loud, so not a quiet, date location, but great to come with 1 person for good food, or with a small group for brunch at the tables. 4 stars  Food- And now for the best part. The food! They have a small menu which I don't mind because everything is well thought out and creative. The cheese omelet (with Wisconsin cheddar of course) was well-cooked, didn't have too much cheese to make it goopy, and went very well with the sauteed onions. The made-from-scratch Belgian waffle was DIVINE. Every bite was delicious and the REAL maple syrup it's served with is delicious. Don't drench the waffle so you can taste the amazing batter itself and the syrup to compliment it. 5 stars.  Drinks- ORDER THE FRESH HONEY LEMONADE! Wonderfully refreshing on a hot day, fresh, homemade taste, and sweetened with honey to add that kick at the end. 4 STARS.  Bottom line- come early, wait in line with good company, try 1 thing with syrup, 1 without, and order the lemonade. Go home happy.",

However the exception was the home fries, which came in a large block, were greasy and tasted like they were previously frozen. Other than that, the service was great, coffee was good and they kept the refills coming. I'll def be back but will choose the homestyle potatoes instead.",

Ordered milk for the kiddos and it's organic. The bread is so good and they make their  house-made Blueberry  preserves, and their home fries with rosemary are soooo yummy.I can't believe she remembered me. What a compliment, \"I can never forget your eyes\" she said. Thank you Ernie!!! You know how to run a restaurant",

    "text": "Last visit was not a pleasant experience. I was dining alone and carrying a briefcase. I was given a seat at the bar that is ahead of you and to your left as you enter. Not the long tables facing the window. But the smaller one across from that.   There was a piece of scrambled egg on my chair. I grabbed a napkin from the unused chair next to me to wipe it off. I sat down on my newly cleaned chair and put my briefcase on the empty chair next to me and started looking at the menu. 30 seconds later someone informs me they are planning on squeezing in next to me. You are practically elbow to elbow at that bar. So I take my briefcase off the chair and go to put it on the floor (no room on the table) and I'm disgusted by all the pieces of leftover food littering the ground.  I'm not putting my stuff on such a filthy floor. I walked out and headed to Phoenix Public Market. On the way, I phoned Matt's and asked to speak to the manager. I explained what happened, she said that they ALWAYS keep the floors clean, so she doesn't understand how it happened, and would I like to come back and get a to go order ? No. I would not.   I've been here once before and thought the food was pretty good. Although it's really not worth dealing with all the hassle of the long waits, small tables, and sassy help.   It's bacon and eggs and waffles. Not exactly 3 star Michelin fare. There are plenty of good, CLEAN, breakfast restaurants in the city that have the same type of food. So I don't plan on going back anytime soon.",

If you're one of those people who can't tolerate even a little golden color on your omelet you'd be unhappy.  It wasn't a lot or bad but there was some.  I don't care about that.  The orange juice was obviously fresh squeezed from good oranges.  My problem was the hash browns.  They were in a rectangular, flat shape, overcooked (crisp) and oily.  It was obvious the rectangles are made ahead of time and thrown on a grill as needed.  My toast was a disappointment too as it seemed like instead of spreading butter on each piece they had put an indentation in the middle of one slice, put a huge glob of butter in the indent and put the two pieces together.  One piece had very little butter on it and all in one spot.  The other piece had a well of mostly melted butter so that piece had too much on it.  The service was very good and people were friendly.  The seating leaves a LOT to be desired.",

I was in town and staying near the airport with some extra morning time and decided to take the light rail system to downtown and walk to Matt's. First, it's in a great area of Phoenix, near the downtown ASU campus. It's a little bit of a hike from the train line to Matt's but the walk was great. I sat at the counter and was greeted very warmly, with was the best part of the visit.  All of the waitresses were great. I went with a simple breakfast, eggs in a sandwich with bacon, which was pretty good.  I also ordered the homefries, as opposed to the hash browns. Can get hash browns anywhere and wanted to try their personal touch on fries.  Absolutely plain and lacked much flavor. Too chewy and rubbery.  At that moment I wish I had ordered the hash browns.  It's a cute place, service was great and everyone was very friendly.  But in this particular case, I was disappointed in the food. I'm not a big meat eater and that is probably what sells best here.  Maybe next time it will be better.",

It's on the louder side, but I don't mind at all.   They have their daily special and Sunday happened to be steak and eggs which sold out a few minutes after we go there, and I ordered the waffles. Everything was so yummy! Truly like a southern breakfast. The waffles were so soft and fluffy, and the eggs were also cooked just the way I like. The ingredients they use seem to be pretty good for you too (real butter olive oil cage free eggs if you're into that kind of stuff)   The staff were so nice too even though it was packed.

    "text": "Wow. Best breakfast place I've ever been to.  Visited while in town for the Superbowl (boo Pats!) and this was one of the famous go-to places I found. We went and holy crap, the line was LONG. It took us like 30-45 min to get a table. I would've waited an hour to eat here though. The food was THAT good.  I started with the strawberry honey lemonade. Best lemonade I've ever had in my life. The honey complimented the strawberry lemonade so well, I could not believe it was not a more common drink. For breakfast, I ordered the breakfast sandwich and the cherry sausage. My Dad ordered the standard breakfast and we also shared a waffle.  The waffle came out first, so we started with that. Best waffle I've ever had. The flavor and crispness of it was so unique and delicious. I did not think a waffle could blow my mind, but that one did. I ended up finishing most of that waffle, when originally I was just planning on taking a few bites.  By the time my breakfast sandwich and sausage came, I was already feeling full, but I powered through it anyway. I got halfway through both and felt extremely full, but could not let myself waste such quality food. The sausage's flavor was very sweet and almost dessert-like. The sandwich bread was this giant artisan looking bun and the eggs, bacon, and other fillings were cooked and spiced perfectly. I feel like a broken record at this point, but this food was phenomenal.   If this breakfast place was in Capitol Hill in Seattle, they would put everyone else out of business. Our best breakfast places pale in comparison to this spot, and we have some solid breakfast spots.  You've set a new standard for breakfast, and I hate that because you are located so far away! PLEASE come to Seattle!",

Anyway, the service was very good, my dad started asking the waitress questions and this is usually when I get a little embarrassed, however she knew her shit and my dad liked her responses.  Home made juice was great, coffee was good hot and strong.  The food here is VERY BASIC, but they use the best possible ingredients.  The bread for example that came with my omelet was artisan shit, so good with nuts and seeds....mmmmmmm and the jam although may not have been homemade it was the expensive stuff :)  I will definitly be back if I am ever in the hood!",

While it's nicely cooked, it's almost completely covered in coarse-ground, strong pepper. To me, it was inedible. They very kindly replaced it with sausage, but that was almost burnt. Puzzling.  The next thing was the hash browns. I ordered them \"extra crispy.\" What came out was a pale, limp, undercooked, slight greasy brick of potatoes. They looked nothing like the pictures I've seen posted.  Since I'd already sent back the bacon, I sucked it up and ate it but it wasn't appealing or tasty.   I don't live in Phoenix but, if I did, I don't believe I'd be back.",

    "text": "Solid breakfast, good service, long waits. 3 1/2 stars.  I first went to Matt's Big Breakfast years ago when it had first become really popular. I was pleasantly surprised to see that it's still going strong years later--although I wasn't as excited to have to wait in a long line, just like before! The new setting is at least twice as big as it used to be, so it packs in a lot more people than in years past. Although they're still turning out some solid food, it doesn't seem as inspired as before. It seems to me that the push to grow has resulted in some decrease in quality. Maybe this is a nostalgia thing for me--the past is always better in my memory.  Setting: This place has a very cozy feel to it. You sit very close to your neighbors, so you shouldn't bring your most private conversations here. I like the breakfast bar area the most. It's a pretty simple setting--it's about t he food!  Food: I have had a number of items here over the years, and they've all been really good. The bacon and sausage selection has always been particularly good. During my latest visit, I had the day's special, which was a 3-egg scramble with sausage, spinach, mushrooms, and some cheese, served with potatoes and toast. I think that the savory dishes like this (as opposed to sweeter dishes like pancakes and waffles) are what Matt's does the best. I wasn't really impressed with the sausage in this scramble. It seemed more like a mass-manufactured sausage than anything I remember having at Matt's before. The potatoes were over-oiled, but everything else was decent. The highlight of my breakfast may have been the preserves for my toast. The blackberry preserves were really good! Lots of chunks of real berries. Despite what I said about the savory vs. sweet thing, the waffle was pretty good, too.  Service: Solid. There is usually a decent wait here, especially on weekends. The best time to come is during the week if you are able to do so, because the weekend waits can be an hour long.  I'll come back when I have the opportunity again in the future, but my breakfast attention has drifted elsewhere.",

It shows in the homemade belgian waffles with sweet creamery butter & real maple syrup, the thick sliced peppery & oh so perfect bacon, the omelets made with Wisconsin cheddar, the rosemary home fries, the breakfast sandwich, the fresh-squeezed OJ and, of course, the bottomless cup of locally roasted dark roast coffee.

    "text": "I have lived within 200 meters of this fine establishment for two months and I finally ventured there today.  Why did I wait so long?  I have to admit, I was unimpressed with the petite breakfast menu.  I am used to pages of breakfast options.  1 page for eggs, 1 page for scrabbles etc.  Well Matt's has 1 page (period).  What they lack in options they more than make up in quality.  They are not a jack of all breakfast trades, they are masters of a few.    I started my first foray with a simple two eggs, sausage, hash browns and toast.  Potatoes were actually browned to a wonderful golden brown.  The cinnamon raisin, walnut toast was thick and great.  the home made country sausage links were a nice blend of spice and subtle sweetness.  Ok, my eggs were a bit runny they were more over easy than the over medium that I wanted, also a bit cold.  But I survived.  I sat at the counter and the young lady that served me there was wonderful.  She really added value as a friendly attentive server.  I tried to see if she had a name tag so I could specifically mention her, but I never saw one.  I will return with friends and family soon.  Side note- I was a bit disappointed to find they do not open until 6:30am.  I got there at 6:00am.  I can also tell you that on a Saturday morning, they were already full and had people queuing up for tables by 6:55 AM.",

I loved our awesomely sassy server who offered gracious, quick, and efficient service.  I ordered a waffle with bacon (next time I'll get even more of that crazy delish bacon!), which came with real butter and syrup. My husband ordered the hot oatmeal -without the listed raisins- and our server very thoughtfully brought a side of a fruit compote as a substitute add-in, which was perfect.  Including fresh OJ for me and unlimited coffee for him, our total was just $27.  Our server even brought a coffee to-go for my husband to take on our flight. We'll be back!",

You cannot grab seats at the breakfast bar when available, you have to be wait listed for that too. The restaurant is freezing with metal chairs, I presume to turn over tables faster.        We ordered a glass of milk, the strawberry honey lemonade and OJ. The lemonade was heavenly, and the OJ was best. The food and drink is strictly why they got 3 stars at all. I ordered their BLT. Joe ordered the Belgian waffle, a side of hash browns and bacon. We placed our order at 12:10, didn't get our food until 12:36.  The bacon was great, the Belgian waffle was the prefect amount of sweet. Thought we should try out new restaurants since we're in a food desert in Laveen haha. Will not be returning here though, sticking with our favorite Morning Squeeze in Scottsdale or Kiss the Cook in Glendale when permissible.",

This place is hopping, but if you're dining alone, they'll do their best to scoot you into the bar amongst the other solo travelers.  I ordered chicks and something: two eggs, hash or home fries, sausage or bacon, and your choice of yum-yum bread with homemade preserves.  I took mine: poached, hashed, patties, and wheat with extra butter and the strawberry preserve.     Staff was attentive, I didn't feel rushed in spite of the congregating line in the courtyard, and the food came fast.  Lots of happy people and smiles.  If I could change just one thing...the coffee is a bit weak for my tastebuds and they make their iced coffee by pouring hot coffee over ice (no-thank-you!).  And if I could change two things, I would recommend that the hashbrowns be cold water washed before frying - this allows them to crisp and prevent that gooey middle that mine came with.  Other then that: bliss.",

Nothing really stood out to us that we had to try. And I'm sorry but $8.45 for two eggs, potatoes and toast? Insane. We ended up paying for my coffee to go and went to Snooze. Way better experience.

I was not that hungry but the aroma's coming from the kitchen made my mouth water. Instead of getting a single menu item I opted from the offerings under \"On The Side\". My dish consisted of one egg over easy (perfectly cooked and tasted farm fresh), think cut bacon (oh my, simply delish) and toast with homemade preserves. It was easy to tell that the kitchen took pride in their dishes and uses only the highest quality ingredients. If I had to complain about anything would be the noise level.

I also had their infamous Rosemary Home Fries, which are cooked in olive oil and Rosemary and SO DAMN GOOD!   This time, I had the Waffle, which came with bacon and I ordered a side of the Rosemary Home Fries. They are so addicting! The bacon as thick and cooked just the way I like it...and so tasty!

    "text": "Despite the rave from yelp reviews, I thought this place was just OK - nothing special if you ask me. Nothing wow'ed me. I came in around 6:30am so beat the crowd which started pouring in an hour later.  The food portions are generous.  Pulpy orange juice - YUM  Hash brown was bland on its own (ate my friend's hash brown), not as flavorful as I would've hoped. I still ate the whole thing with ketchup and pepper.   I ordered The Hog and Chick with eggs over medium, thick bacon and wheat toast. The home fries were too hard for my taste, wanted them to be more on the softer side with crispy edges but it looked and tasted overcooked. The bacon was thick but it also tasted overcooked. Again, I still ate everything so still good.  Service was great - they came around a few times offering coffee and water refills, asked how we were doing.   I'd still recommend a trip here but go in with low expectations. It might have been all the hype about the placed that I heard (it was featured in Triple D) so I came in thinking this was going to be a diner with something unique to offer...",

I had no idea what to expect, but since it is a very rare occasion for me to be up at 7am and I happen to be in the area,  Matt's big breakfast was my destination.  The venue is pretty small with an equally small menu.  I was expecting more options.  We ordered waffles with bacon and The Five Spot (breakfast sandwich).  Both were very good.  Coffee was from cave creek and was pretty good as well.  Service was great.  Our server was upbeat and friendly.  She told me how much she loved working there and I can see she was sincere.    I do plan on coming back here.  I grade them a solid A.",

We got there at 2pm when they close at 2:30 and I was really happy to get my afternoon breakfast fix while visiting town for a mini-vacation with my mom. Luckily it was not packed at all at this time on a weekday and they were happy to fit us in before closing.  We both got a daily special egg scramble which was really tasty with chorizo, jalapenos, and aged cheddar. I loved the home fries, though if I'm being nitpicky mine were a little burnt in spots and the rosemary would have been nice chopped up finely instead of big sprigs. Overall, the plate was very oily and greasy and it was definitely something I could whip up at home but it still hit the spot. I appreciate a relaxed diner that uses fresh and less-processed ingredients. Also, fun fact: in Phoenix unlike Portland or San Francisco, the waitstaff at a hipster diner are blond, tan, and in great shape. Everyone was extremely nice and we left to a literal chorus of \"Bye! Thank you! Have a great day!\"",

The eggs were cooked perfectly, the hash browns were some of the best that I have ever had, and the pork chop was flavorful. The toast, that I put under my eggs came with homemade strawberry jam so I ordered a second order just so I could try it...and it too was great. Their prices are only slightly higher than a dinner. The atmosphere was done very modern but with a salute to an old school dinner. I actually came straight from PHX airport and got there before the crowd. I heard my waitress talking to someone else and she said the \"wait\" usually starts around 8:30 am. By the time I left, they were on a wait.",

Bland to the point that I had to cover with ketchup,  which is a shame BC I'm sure they get great product.  Wife got the waffle.  Super good.  Anyways.  3 stars BC its good not great.

In any case, the food is as good as you can expect, a little pricey, but indeed one of the best breakfast spots in Phoenix. Like any good breakfast place, they'll make pretty much anything you want, and have a daily feature, but it's hard to have to stray from the menu. Between their Chop & Chick (two eggs and a skillet-seared pork chop) or the Belgian Waffle, you simply can't go wrong.",

I know that some people in Phoenix will not be able to wait, since they have their Denny's and Waffle Houses in their neighborhood.  The staff is always in a rush but as pleasant as cherubs.  The coffee smells delightful, and the honey lemonade is the bees knees  The food is the best part! I love the ingredients that Matt picks, which are local and organic when the product is convenient, affordable, or rockstar status.  All the eggs are from local cage free chickens.  All of the jams and jellies (which rotate on a daily basis) are from local businesses and they will probably help relieve any allergies you have (if you live in Phoenix).  When I was a young Big Breakfast eater, I enjoyed the Five Spot and worked my way up to the to the succulent egg and pork Chop and Chick before graduating to simply ordering the special, and trusting that Matt and his minions will take care of me.  The specials are the reason why I keep coming back, and why I bring my friends.  I have brought out of town poets, musicians, and artists to Matt's.  They all love the diner feel, the orange and simple menu, the nice and friendly staff, and of course - the BIG breakfast.",

I had a Sunday special which consisted of a 3-egg scramble and house potatoes. Both were very good. I will be back for sure next time I stay the night in Phoenix.",

No way.  The couple of times I've been there, service has been okay. Friendly servers, but slow with refills on drinks. Also feels rushed - who can blame them with lines out the door? Atmosphere is loud and a little cramped, but not terribly uncomfortable.  The food is good. I would go back, don't get me wrong. But is it anything special? Not really. I've had pancakes there as well as eggs with bacon, and it's pretty standard.",

The waffles were good but, snall, the real maple syrup was tasty, bacon was good, the potatoes were good. But, the prices were steep for what you got. Won't be going back.

The sweet cream butter and maple syrup makes this amazing waffles out of this world.   The thick cut bacon is perfectly crispy on the edges but chewy too. So good. The hash brown is perfectly crispy without being burnt and tasty. The scrambled eggs were so fluffy. The blueberry jam that came with the toast was not overly sweet and just so full of ripe blueberry. And the freshly squeezed orange juice. I'm salivating just writing this review!  The wait wasn't long. We went around 8:30 a.m. on Saturday morning and waited maybe 10 minutes for a table. Service was fast and great.",

First of all this place is small, very crowed and the noise level is very loud. Not the kind of place to come to if you have a headache. Our waitress came to get our drink order which was good, but not great my bottom was not even on the chair yet. Not good because I wasn't sure if I wanted breakfast or lunch.  The food was good, but I was sitting staring at the bathroom which is the table I hate to sit at.  Not sure I would go back considering there are so many other places in the valley with better atomisphere, better food and they have enough tables that you're not staring at the bathroom.",

Location/parking: This is downtown Phoenix, so there's some street parking and meters near by.  I live close enough to walk.  If you're waiting, you will likely wait outside.   Variety: Not a huge menu but typical breakfast offerings of eggs, bacon, sausage, pancakes, waffles, and breakfast sandwich. There's an option with egg whites and vegetables.   Food:  I ordered the cheese omelet with potatoes and toast.  The omelet was perfect and cooked just right - a basic cheese omelet with my choice of cheese.  The potatoes were delicious, but some were not cooked at all. They were flavored with rosemary. There are various options for toast; I chose sourdough. They brought it with delicious jam.   Service: Efficient and quick.  Most everyone was friendly.   Ambiance/noise level: It's going to be busy likely, and it's cramped, so it's not super quiet but I could still hear everything.

After the person I was with got theirs, but I can't control how fast things get cooked and I would rather have them serve the food warm than let it sit and get cold waiting for the rest of the parties order. The French toast was delicious because of the house made maple syrup and the great quality of the bread used. I'm not a huge fan of sausage, but this one was soooo good! The bacon though...was...AMAZING! Both of the meats had some sort of sweet glaze, yum! I loved the char on it...yummy. Definitely deserves to be called the best breakfast spot in Arizona.",

Took 1 hour to get seated, brought out a burned waffle, screwed up my husband's order, let our coffee cups go empty (never 1 refill) then 5 different people asked us 8 times if we were all finished, would like anything else, can I take that check even though I just brought your plate, aka GET THE HELL OUT. Ok, this is my last mistake. Matts Big Breakfast I'm gone peace out used to love you but you wrecked our relationship with your dumb hipster waiters",

I had the cheese omelette with peppers and onions($2 extra charge).  First off the cheese wasn't anything special for an aged Wisconsin cheddar, and the pricy peppers and onions? Well they were barely cooked with no seasoning at all added, but the worst part was the hash browns, Totally Inedible!! They were greasy, unseasoned and undercooked( translucent through 80%).  My husband had the waffle which was better than most, but nothing outstanding.  I was happy that they helped us out with the bill after I complained about the hash browns, but the manager was not the nicest about it. Made it seem that not  liking greasy, uncooked hash browns is a matter of taste- like it was unreasonable that I hadn't eaten them, and complained!?  Not sure I will bother coming back, there are plenty of trendy diners out there that will treat me better, it's too bad because I had high hopes, and liked their atmosphere.",

Ten minutes later we received our mimosas. 45 minutes later, every single table around us, including the 5 that walked in a considerable amount of time after we did, all had their food. At this point, we have to board our plane in 5 minutes so we track down our waitress, because it had been quite a while since she had checked on us, and asked her if we can just get it to go and please get the check. She walks straight to the pos and gets our check, waits for us to pay for the meal and then sends the manager to let us know that they cannot find our check. Stop...so we just paid $77 for food that we aren't going to get? Owner assured us he will \"make it right\". Absolute worst experience I have EVER had at a restaurant.

We thought with all the popularity there must be something great here and were somewhat disappointed so decided to try again.  This time was even more of a disappointment.  Somewhat of a long wait.  Then the food:  well if your going there for a standard eggs, bacon, hash browns....you may as well go to Denny's.  I'm not sure what they did to the hash browns but they were terrible and tasted nothing like hash browns.  As for the price I recall being $9 +.  Very expensive for 2 eggs, bacon, nasty has browns and toast.  I always like to give a restaurant a second chance so now I am done with Matt's big breakfast.  Of course there are many other menu items and based on the crowd they always have, they must be doing something right.  I'm just saying that if all your looking for is a standard egg breakfast, this is not the place you want to go.",

My party of four waited nearly 40 minutes today(Friday morning) and when we were finally seated our waitress promptly greeted us and took our drink order. After that, service was slow and had poor follow up. Forget trying to get a coffee cup refilled(I got up and went near the kitchen window to get a refil).    The good news is that the omelette and egg scrambles are delicious and large.  Homemade breads are wonderful. Our meals were delivered by some other team member and we never saw our waitress again until it was time for a check.  No follow up!!! Management may think the team approach is fine but someone, ie the primary waitress, needs to maintain some degree of attention to the table once food has been served. When we were leaving we mentioned this to our waitress and she just shrugged her shoulders and thanked us for coming...wow! I must reiterate how good the food is...We will return again because of that fact.",

I was really disappointed the last time we went in at the attitudes of the staff. They seemed almost cocky as if they were doing ME a favor allowing me to eat there. They wouldn't tell us an appx wait time, refused to split check saying we could do the math ourselves and just let them know, and several other rude responses to our questions. They really forget that there are tons of other good breakfast joints in the area and we don't need to go there. We are central Phoenix residents and for many of our friends and family the go-to for restaurant recommendations. After the last visit I am taking them off our list of breakfast to recommend. It's a real shame and I hope if we ever go back we will be met with friendliness and an appreciation for our business.",

Their coffee is good, but not with milk or almond milk. Sorry, but this has actually been a dealbreaker for me and I will go to the Phoenix Market Cafe close by instead.

Even if you are not a  bacon lover, you'll fall in love with these nice smokey slices.  Nice and thick and cooked to perfection.    I had the Hog and Chick with thick sliced bacon.  3 slices bacon, 2 eggs, hash browns or home fries and your choice of toast.  What is the difference between hash browns and home fries you ask....hash browns are shredded potatoes cooked in butter.  Home fries are chunks of potatoes cooked in olive oil, rosemary and onions.    Hubby had the special of the day.  3 meat scramble with hash browns and flour tortillas.  This is definitely a meat lover's delight.  They do not skimp on the meats either.  Canadian bacon, Chipotle  and Cheddar sausage and Spicy sausage and cheese.  One drawback, parking lot is very small and difficult to maneuver around if you have a large car.  The staff were all helpful and friendly albeit a bit slow with coffee refills.  Some say breakfast is on the pricey side.  However you get a lot of bang for your buck!  Definitely recommend you check out Matt's if you are in the area.",

Cheap and a giant meal on a large plate. The place was full of locals; we were the only out-of-state license plate on the street.",

While you are waiting make sure to grab a menu, so you can peruse at your leisure.  Not that you are going to need a lot of time with it, unless you are a really slow reader.  There is only a handful of items, but don't be put off by that. Cause what they do...they do it amazingly!  Daughter had an omelet with cheese and mushroom, Son and Wife did steak and eggs.  I had scrambled eggs and sausage.  Sounds basic, right.  Wrong, it was incredible.  The eggs were all cooked to perfection.  Most people don't know how to cook, so it finishes on the plate.  These people should hold a class on it.  Eggs cooked through and super moist.  The steak was aged and tender.  The Sausage were fresh and infused with subtle smoky flavor.  My Daughter's omelet was as big as her head and filled to the brim with cheese and mushrooms.  Each order came with potatoes, so me being a fatty, I always gotta go with the hash brown.  They were crisp on outside and tender on the in.  It was a great compliment to a wonderful meal.  A meal that was elevated to an eating experience by the attentive and caring staff.  As a whole all the patrons in the restaurant should have hoisted the cooks and wait staff on their shoulder and showered them with praise, but alas a heart felt thank you, will have to do.",

I had to actually get up and get my own hot sauce because it wasn't offered or did our waitress even return to ask how the food was. They seem to be trying too hard to be trendy.

Mostly a young crowd (this location was close by an ASU campus), I would guess they are drawn by good eats at good prices. I ordered the Sunday special, a nicely trimmed center cut sirloin steak, two eggs, home fries and sourdough toast with homemade strawberry preserves. The steak was cooked to order perfectly (medium rare), the home fries, eggs and toast were equally good. My wife ordered the Niman ranch hamburger with thick sliced bacon. Unfortunately, it came to the table well after my meal came and then had to be returned because it was underdone. By the time a properly cooked replacement arrived, I had already eaten my meal(at my wife's insistence!).  On the plus side, the burger was delicious and she yummied it up. No less than three of the staff members apologized for the mishap and the manager let us know he was taking the burger off the bill, even though we never griped about the delay.   I am from out of town, but I'm loving Phoenix hospitality! I would definitely return to Matt's; hoping I get the opportunity during my short stay here.",

There were about 2 other couples waiting after us and then there was no wait to be seated. So going later could be a good tactic; however, the specials had run out, so as long as you don't care about that, you got it made.  I ordered the hog and chick with home fries, The bacon is the bomb, thick and delicious, the home fries are also so flavorful, and my scrambled eggs were cooked perfectly.  You also get a large slice of buttered toast and jam.  The man had the chop and chick and a side of bacon with home fries. I tried the chop and it was good, but a little over cooked (dry) in my opinion. He also had the strawberry honey lemonade which was delicious! I can't order drinks with no refills because I drink a lot, so I had the iced tea.   Overall, very good! I wouldn't wait 2 hours to be seated though, I'd come back for the bacon!",

It's not a cheap place by any means (reasonable), but you can get a garbage bfast at any chain for 5$, or pay a little more and get a quality meal that leaves an impression. Boom shockalocka!",

Even though it was a weekday morning, there was still a sizable wait. Luckily, since it was just me, I was able to get a seat at the bar. I ordered the waffle with no bacon and asked for a side of hash browns as a substitute for the bacon. Also go the blueberry lemonade to drink and it was outstanding. Food came it out and I can legitimately say that it was the best waffle that I had. The butter that came on top of it was out of this world good. Hash browns were a huge portion as well and tasted great. Even though they were slammed the food came out pretty quickly. Service could have been a bit better, the girl working at the bar didn't really seem to care to be there. Also got charged for the hashbrowns when I asked for them as a substitute for the bacon. Not a big deal but it's the small things. Will definitely be back. I'm not a huge breakfast person but this place is outstanding.",

The food is always so good and just healthy enough that you don't feel guilty afterwards.  We had a server (a girl with dark hair who is shorter with a higher voice) come up to us for our drink order and we just ordered the honey lemonade and asked about possibly using the chicken sausage as an add on to a plate but she said they had run out of the chicken sausage, we understood. We saw her walk away and start talking to someone else. We were sitting for a little bit when we noticed the chalk board with the flavors for the honey lemonade. The server never told us that there were other options that day. The manager (Jason?) happened to have walked by and we asked to change our drinks to a strawberry one and a blueberry one (Blueberry was AMAZING). He then got them changed but they werent actually changed because the server hadnt even grabbed the drinks yet (we could see her standing talking to someone) the manager came back (note: we still hadnt ordered) and we asked about the chicken sausage. He then said they never run out of it because it is a staple. So we asked if it could be put into the chicken sausage (which the menu says add sausage $1.25) and the manager said of course we can do whatever. So then the server  came back to take our order and then said she asked the kitchen about the the chicken sausage would be a $4 charge to add it to the omelet. We decided not to add and just ordered everything as is. I got the waffle, and my boyfriend got the cheese omelet. Both plates were so good and actually my favorite part was the sour dough toast. I understand that its a busy place but the place is small and its obvious to see when a server is standing around and on a saturday morning at 10am I cannot imagine why they would. The food and the management was good so I still wanted to give to my review 4 stars.  And keep the blueberry lemonade all the time!!",

My first time was today, and on the walk back I actually considered the budget of eating there DAILY.  Could this be done?  Hmm.  I recommend this to everyone - locals and tourists!  I heard the crowds were bad - notsomuch.  I found two seats at the bar right when I walked in at around 9am on a Friday morning.  The waitress was cheerful and energetic.  I ordered the hog and chick ... phenomenal bacon.  I want to try the lemonade next time I'm there.  The guy next to me at the bar kept going on and on about how amazing it was.  Like almost sexually.",

Waffle (with real maple syrup) + extra crispy thick butcher cut bacon + crispy hashbrowns (grilled in real butter - you can really taste it). This meal is not for the diet conscious. Hubby always gets the Chop n Chick (as seen on Diner's Drive Ins & Dives) - this is tasty too!  Simple, no frills food with outstanding taste. LOVE this place!",

There was about a 45 minute wait to be seated and the place was hustling and bustling--but the food and service were both exceptional. The iced teas and lemonades have honey in them, which makes them tasty, but also a little surprising if you're not expecting it. I got the Hog and Chick with bacon, and it was very good. The bacon comes crisp and thick, the eggs are good, hashbrowns were dense but throughly cooked, and the sourdough bread with strawberry jam was buttery and fantastic. I also sampled a little bit of the griddle cakes, and they're light, fluffy, and slightly sweet with a cornbread flavor.   I would highly recommend Matt's Place. Well worth the wait.",

    "text": "I must agree with reviewers who have been other than taken aback by the place and agree with Jerry J's assessment of it.  Took the advice of a seemingly seasoned lady I am working with. She is a doll and I trusted her judgement of this greasy spoon.  If she reads this, she'll know I'm speaking of her.  We arrived to hotel last night and she mentioned she would be going here for brunch.  I am an avid breakfast lover so sounded good to me, even spectacular.  I walked there from hotel, wrong shoes to wear my bad, no one elses, got blisters. The place looked like a dive, as I was told it would, so not surprised. Saw the menu, their special of the day was biscuits and gravy which I love.  But wanted more than carbs so opted for eggs, bacon, toast and hashbrowns.  I did ask my server, \"could I pay more and get the biscuits and gravy without the toast\", she said unfortunately no. Not her fault I understand but how dumb of the proprietors rules to make that not an option, I said I was happy to pay more.  They lost out on that option as this may have been a bettter review as she'd said the B&G were very good.  The breakfast came, unimpressed visually.  2 eggs over medium, 1 was a broken yolk but they gave it to me anyway.  I found that odd, they goofed, why give me their whoooopsie? How hard is it to make another egg? not.  The bacon was very crisp which is usually fine, but over crisped and way too much pepper is another.  The sourdough toast was wonderful as I'm a bread maker as well, and the strawberry jam was good also, not mine, but good.  The bacon I took wrapped up with the rest of the jam on it as I'll eat that later in the day when I want a little something to munch on.  The hashbrowns : oh soooo very grease laden.  Pleantiful, which I did appreciate but my gosh there is just simply no reason to douce them in oil or grease, whatever it was.  I know how the perfect hashbrowns are made and as easy as they are I would only answer the how to's if our kids asked me. They deserve my answers and recipes.   But as easy as they are, often times you get an oversogged in grease outcome.  They were hot, appreciated that but all that clear liquid just made them pasty/gooey and not in a good way.  The server was a nice young gal and of that I'm appreciative also. I won't go back nor will I tell anyone to go there.  Simply lack luster and mostly due to the food.",

After one bite of the hash browns I set them to the side and refused to try another. The bacon was delicious but a little undercooked, and the fat was still elastic. The egg special was delish.

They had raw sugar in a sugar dispenser (win) a special of the day (that was not just a discounted version of something already oh the menu) and the food had great taste. Yes taste. HOWEVER, unless you appreciate quality, you will find this place disappointing.  Real maple syrup is not anywhere near the same as Mrs Butterworth. Real butter does not taste like the stuff dispensed onto your movie popcorn. Well you get my point.   I will be back for breakfast another day.",

OK, not sure about the negative reviews so far. This is a WYSIWYG restaurant, no gimmicks just good American breakfast and lunch food. The griddlecakes were awesome, and their bottomless coffee was great to wash them down. I had to ask for more maple syrup as I like to drown my cakes! I was catching an early flight to Dallas so I beat the \"rush\" that I've seen in other Yelp photos. The staff was friendly enough, I'd just wish the seating area was more spread out (it feels congested) but I guess they h ad to work with the space they were given.

I really enjoyed the environment but I really really didn't like the fact that I had to order 2 times because every time I would ask for something it was only for Thursday's or Wednesday, apparently the restaurant has two different menus which didn't know so that was frustrating but after the 3rd time we ordered. Our food came in fast and the waitress was kept checking back with us and making sure our drinks where full at all times. When I'm back to visit I'll make sure to come here again.",

The food was so good the first few times that I have always looked forward to eating there.  However, the food and service has been growing steadily worse, and the atmosphere has become painful. After my experience this morning, I won't be going back.  The noise levels in the restaurant -- which are always loud -- actually make eating there extremely uncomfortable when it's busy. Today, I wasn't even able to block out enough sound with my noise-blocking earphones to make it bearable.  Service is generally not particularly friendly here, probably because it's so busy. But today, I don't think my server even looked at me. She was prompt with the water and coffee, including refills. And the food. But her demeanor made me almost sorry to be putting her out by asking for a beverage, or ordering anything. It's not a comfortable guest experience.   Worst of all was the food. It was extremely greasy (from the eggs to the butter literally pouring off the toast when I lifted it), the eggs were underdone, and the meat was tough and didn't have much flavor. The potatoes were delicious and absolutely the highlight of the meal, and the toast was fresh and fluffy -- but I can't justify going there just for the potatoes and toast, especially when that toast is slathered with so much butter it runs down in rivers.  My experience wasn't awful. It was just disappointing. And bad enough that I won't be going back.",

Everything I had was well done and makes me want to go back on a Monday so I can try their heuvos ranchero with green chile sauce.

I had a few bites of a waffle and it was amazing. Maybe one of the best waffles I've ever had. The pancakes were OK.

Oh, so were their home made preserves for the toast. Big lines and 30+ min wait to be seated.  Counter seating is NOT self seating like most places so you will be yelled at if you didn't know and walked in and sat yourself. There is construction right outside the restaurant where you will be standing out in the Phoenix weather inhaling dust.  Decore inside is so so, kinda plain.  Two chalk boards with daily specials written on them.  The bathrooms are hidden behind one of the chalk boards, but no signage on the doors to tell you which door is the restroom. Overall, I think this place is overrated,over priced and over crowded.  Like all breakfast themed diners.",

It was a Saturday morning and there was a crowd outside. The wait was almost an hour but there was lemon water and we were in the shade so it was not bad. When we were called inside to be seated it struck me how loud it was. I have 2 kids and am used to loud so it wasn't really a bother. Once we were seated we were brought waters and our drink order was taken. Once our drinks were brought out we ordered. It took about 15 minutes to get our food. We had an order of pancakes, Saturday scramble and the 5 spot. The food was good. I was expecting something super out of this world but was not blown away. The home fries had a lot of rosemary but everything was cooked perfect. The pancakes were probably our favorite. They were fluffy and buttery and so delicious. If we were in the area we might stop by again if it wasn't busy to try the lunch.",

That was to be expected so we relaxed on the benches out front while we waited our turn. It was still quite warm out so that wasn't the most comfortable wait, but there's not much room inside to wait. The person that seated us was quite friendly as was our server and frankly everyone that we came into contact with. We were seated in a small room behind the cash register, which was interesting. It has a nice window looking outside, but includes a refrigerator and some storage space so employees come in and out, which is just a little bit awkward, but it was nice to have our own space with a bit of elbow room. The food, which is really why we come to Matt's, was good as usual. Such wonderful options and we never walk away disappointed.",

I asked for the hash browns to be crispy and they actually did it right!  Go figure, most breakfast places mess it up.. and bring me very oily hash browns.  We came on a Monday during brunch time and it was busy.  I don't think I would try to come on the weekend as I imagine there's a line out the door.

Ordered the pancakes this morning expecting the same fully goodness and was unpleasantly surprised with a gummy, chewy and dense-with-a-hint-of-stale stack of nastiness.  Think pre-teen hockey puck.  Couldn't even choke half of one pancake down.  Between the declining quality of their food and the obnoxiously loud dining room, you'd be better off skipping MBB.",

It had been since the other building, when to use the bathroom you went in a room in the motel next door (very creepy, but hey it added character). While I do appreciate a more normal bathroom situation there is just something about the new location that leaves me missing the old. That is why I only gave it 4 instead of 5 stars, maybe I'm too nostalgic. I can saw however, the wait time is greatly reduced by having the additional tables. I do also feel that the service is reduced by the addition of the tables. My husband had ordered the three egg special but it came out 10 minutes before my plate of food. I had ordered the ruben which was also very good but I asked for extra thousand island that never came. My cup sat empty waiting for more iced tea for the greater part of our meal.

The cream butter and powdered sugar topping was well portioned; their 100% pure maple syrup was an amazing touch to the waffle as well. Also, make sure that at at least one person in your party gets their homemade Honey Lemonade, especially their raspberry one if it's available. Their bacon is thick and cooked nice and crispy.

I past by it going to my gate today and it was very busy. After I checked into my gate I had some extra time to go and have some food and a drink. I stood there for the hostess to take my name on the reservation which she never wrote it down, I asked how long and she said it would be 5-10 mins. I said okay, she continued to take others peoples names with 1 to 4 people in their party. She never acknowledge me, I finally said you didn't write down my name and then she finally did. No sorry, nothing. In the end she went over my name twice and sat two different reservations, I finally walked away. I am glad I didn't spend a dime at this restaurant. The worst customer service ever. I recommend going somewhere else to spend your money.",

Although we were seated right away and the service was friendly the food was nothing extraordinary and overpriced. It was good but nothing extraordinary in fact the home fries were exactly what I make at home. Sausage was ok but too spicy for my taste. Hubby said the bacon was nothing to write home about in fact he wanted pancakes but wasn't willing to pay basically $8 for a stack of pancakes. Seating was very uncomfortable in wheelchairs and the noise level was like sitting on the runway at Sky Harbor. Still trying to figure out what all the fuss is about. Plus we're home less than an hour and hubby is hungry again. We won't be back",

Considering the Yelp reputation and other reviews.....It was not a place any of us would crave to go to again. This was the first time a place that was rated so highly on yelp did not deliver for our group.  I am a Yelp fan....So With reviews this great, I would still consider trying it even after reading this review. Maybe we had an off day.

I have also heard horror stories of horrendous wait times so we aimed for after breakfast but before lunch. It was indeed packed but we were seated fairly quickly. The place really aint much for the eyes. No real decor and kinda rough looking. Right away we noticed how sparse the menu is. Really not much to choose from. Especially if it is before lunch time.   I ordered the Chop and Chick while my girl had the Hog and Chick. Well... where do I start? First thing, my glass of Iced Tea was filthy! 2 different colors of debris no less. I quickly dismissed it so as to not alert my girl who can be quite sensitive about things of that nature. Her glass was fine. The food comes after a wait that was starting to feel too long. It really seemed as if the cooks ONLY paid attention to the meat and couldn't care less about the rest. My eggs were slimy, my home fries were over cooked to the point you couldn't hardly chew the parts that weren't mush. My girl's hashbrowns were a big greasy mess that she said had no flavor what so ever. My chop was actually pretty damn good as was her bacon. But that was not nearly enough to save a breakfast that was NOT worth the $30.00 bill. Too much worrying about hepster, hippy,  vegan, yada yada not enough focus on good cooking. All the cracked sea salt (which won't come out of the holes in the shaker mind you) and raw sugar (which I freaking hate!) in the world doesn't make up for a lack of attention to detail.  Think twice folks. Don't believe the hype. We won't be going back. Certainly not when Mel's Diner is so close!!!",

I am glad to see they are open in the airport. Blessings and success to you all! :)",

Cannot complain at all about the service (great hospitality from everyone we encountered!) on a very busy Sunday morning. I had the Five Spot, hub had the Belgian Waffle. Both were fresh, hot, and made with good ingredients, but I'm not sure it's worth the drive across town and waiting an hour for (thank you for having inside waiting areas for these hot days.) Giving it four stars on ingredients and hospitality. Otherwise, it would be a solid three.",

    "text": "Have heard so much about Matt's but never tried it before, so waking up early on Sunday, I decided to head over and check it out. Got there around 7:30 this morning, and it wasn't very busy yet-plenty of open tables and counter space. I picked out a table and noticed the Sunday Special of steak and eggs. Decision made. It did take my waitress a couple of minutes to come over, but no biggie (for now). On her first approach, I ordered iced tea, and the steak and eggs (rare and over easy eggs) plus sour dough toast. The food came up very  quickly...Unfortunately, it was the last interaction I had with my server until I was finished. The food was very good. The home fries were delicious, tender chunks of potatoes, sauteed with onions, salt and pepper and rosemary.(A little heavy on the rosemary for my tastes, but that is just me) the eggs were a perfect over easy. The steak was a flavorful centercut sirloin, cooked to a perfect rare as requested. I always worry a little about sirloin being a tougher cut, but it was tender for sirloin. The toast was a slice of thick cut sourdough, definitely NOT straight out of the grocery store. On the side of the toast was a ramekin of some sort of homemade preserves. I couldn't quite figure out what it was, though.  Food gets a definite \"A\".   Service on the other hand, left me wanting more.. As I was waiting for my food, (and while eating), I noticed that the waitresses all kept huddling up and talking, instead of working. I never got a \"check back\" to make sure everything was ok. Especially when ordering a steak, it should be done quickly to make sure the steak was cooked correctly. I never was offered a topping off or a refill on my iced tea. Even when I was finished with my meak and my glass was empty, the waitress finally came over and offered clear my plate, she still did not offer a refill..  I would come back for the food, the another poor service experience would make me reconsider a third visit.",

They have moved into a larger building and their competition around the corner puts a sign up across the street to lure the hungry waiting patrons away from Matt's. Nice tactic, but I will say this place is worth the wait. Everything is fresh, real, homemade-- doesn't get better. I always get the pancakes, the Chop and Chick is good too.. Their home fries and coffee are great.. Fresh preserves on fresh bread. Just go to there. It's great.",

I got \"The Chop & Chick\". The pork rib chop was cooked perfectly. Great seasoning blend, I did add salt, but then I add salt to everything. The homefries were delicious. And the eggs, even though they weren't as runny as I like, were good as well. I also had white toast which you could tell was made from scratch and came with a blueberry preserve, which was also delicious. 5 Star restaurant. I will definitely be talking about Matt's Big Breakfast to all my friends. Keep up the good work.",

All the patrons made a point to say goodbye to her as they left, and I can see why. Her excellent service and ability to make all those around her feel welcome. The food came out fairly quick.

The potatoes were PERFECTION! My eggs were scrambled soft just how I like them. Hubs ordered the butter burger and I tell you that's some of the freshest meat I've had in a long time. I probably bit more off of his burger than he did. Everything was great. And we couldn't leave without replenishing our homemade strawberry preserves. Always a great experience at Matt's! And needless to say NONE of our guests have ever been disappointed!",

I had the special, sausage biscuits and gravy, eggs, and home fries.  The biscuit was gigantic and the sausage gravy full of sausage.  The eggs were cooked perfectly, over-medium.  I didn't like the home fries as they had too much rosemary and it overpowered the potatoes.  I did try the bacon.  It was very good.  The best part was the blueberry jam on toast!  Excellent blueberry flavor!",

The staff was very friendly and attentive, without being pushy or making me feel rushed. Very clean and cute space. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is because an elderly gentleman in a wheelchair needed to use the restroom and I let him ahead of me in line, however, due to the small space and I guess lack of storage, they have a ton of chairs and boxes stacked by the wall adjacent to the restrooms. It took him a great deal of struggling to maneuver his wheelchair enough to get in the restroom. I felt bad for him and tried to move the chairs and boxes as much as possible out of his way. They should make this space more easily accessible. Otherwise, I highly recommend this place!",

And they serve real maple syrup! Almost everything they can is made in house, including excellent strawberry jam that comes if you get toast (or something with toast). Despite the fact that they are extremely busy, service is always fast and friendly. Coffee refills come quickly and often.  You can't lose with this place! Just get here early or come on a weekday if you want to beat the rush.",

As for the food, it was ok.  It's not the best breakfast and doesn't really look like a cozy homemade breakfast, but it isn't bad.  To me it's like a Denny's or iHop, but in a really nice location.",

I've seen people waiting outside, long lines and all, and the place itself is very humble looking so I underestimated the place. This place is unlike any other breakfast place in the sense that you get quantity(portion wise) and quality (in the ingredients). There's something about their ingredients that are so rich in their quality as well as their taste! We ordered the waffle, bacon, scrambled eggs with peppers and onion and the potatoes. Everything was absolutely divine. If I was on death row I would want this to be my last meal, it's that good! Lastly, the customer service was on point!",

We might have waited for 20 minutes around noon with 6 parties in front of us.  Their menu is short, but they get bonus points for offering breakfast all day.  I decided to go with a basic breakfast of 2 eggs, toast, bacon and home fries.  Now I usually love hash browns, but the home fries were delicious.  If you don't like grilled onions and black pepper, then you might want to skip the fries.  Bacon was also pretty peppered, but I thought it was tasty.  So why not 5 stars?  The service was average. Nothing particularly good or bad.  They were efficient, I will give them that.  If the service was great, I would have added that last star.",

The 1 oversized tortilla with the meal was a bit odd though and made the meal more like \"finger food\" while trying to assemble the plate.  My wife's sandwich was good, crispy and flavorful bacon, egg and cheese. However the thickness of the bun was out of proportion to the amount of filling between the pieces.  The Honey/Strawberry lemonade was delicious and all that it was advertised. Be sure to show up early, waiting line outside wasn't too bad but on a hot sunny day, it might become unbearable.   No issues recommending this place. Appeared to be more of a local favorite which is a plus for me!",

It was fresh and felt home cooked.  It was seasoned awesome and everything was cooked perfectly. Wish I could have took pictures but I ate it all before I realized I should. Definitely one of the best",

I was is the \"takeaway\" line to get something quick, and was told it will take 20 minutes for breakfast, plus, there was no cream for coffee. The cashier could not use the cash register until their supervisor came over and unlocked the cash register--this had to happen with every order. Needless to say, if you have a restaurant location at the airport, service and efficiency should be a priority--a necessity.",

    "text": "What is so special about Matt's?  I couldn't figure it out from the pictures on Yelp.  However, our car rental guy recommended it, so we decided to give it a try.    I showed up with low expectations because I am extremely spoiled by the amazing brunch places in SF.  It can't be better than the Bay right...?  The long wait and Phoenix sun made me a little annoyed and my expectations got higher with every minute that passed by.    When we sat down, I looked around, and the whole place was pig themed.  How fitting... my fiance and family calls me a pig all the time.  They say you are what you eat... *shrug*.  So all the signs pointed at me to order their bacon with eggs.  It sounded so simple... so what's the hype?  Their sunny side eggs was cooked to perfection for me to dip my perfectly peppered thick and crispy bacon in the runny yolk.  Their homefries were crispy on the outside, yet soft on the inside cooked with caramelized onions.  Lastly, their sourdough bread was perfect with their delicious strawberry jam.  The dishes are so simple, but their ingredients and cooking skills kill it.  We came here at the beginning of our trip and I couldn't stop thinking about this place on our last day.  I wish I ate here again.  I was about to come grab bottles of their jam as gifts, but they closed early.  So much regret for not planning to come earlier...   If you are my friend and going to Phoenix and reading on my review right now, will you bring me back a jar?  Pretty please?! :D",

    "text": "Found Matt's Big Breakfast while searching for restaurants in the area and Matt's popped up. We came in at 11am on Sunday doe NYE brunch and it was busy. There were probably 25 to 30 people waiting on benches outside of the restaurant. They provide complimentary flavored fruit water for waiting patrons. We checked in with the host inside with our name and number in our party. They call us by name when they are ready for us.  The aesthetics of the restaurant is amazing -- magazine pages worthy. They have several table options -- bar top and window seating for diners of one or two. There's also tables around the rest of the restaurant for two or more diners.   FOOD: - STEAK & EGGS ($15.95): the steak & eggs are Sunday's daily special. My 8 oz steak was cooked medium as I requested and I was surprised it came out cooked perfectly. The steak comes served with a side of A1 steak sauce. You also have a choice of either hash browns or home potatoes -- of course I opted for hash browns cooked well done for that extra crisp. The hash browns tasted exceptional and not commercialized. The inside was moist while the outside was crunchy and crisp. There was a lot of flavor in the hash browns. It goes great with their ketchup. My meal also comes with two eggs prepared any way you like -- over easy for me. It also comes with your choice of sourdough, white, or wheat bread and I opted for sourdough seeing how everyone else opted for that. I don't usually like eating bread, but I really enjoyed the sourdough bread. It comes out toasted and buttered. They also provide homemade preserves -- ask for the strawberry preserve. It's so good. They also sell it by the mason jar for $7 each. Soooo gooood. - CHEESE OMELET ($7.95): my friend really enjoyed his omelet. He added additions to the omelet such as spinach and roasted peppers for an additional $1.00 each. The omelet was huge and so cheesy. He requested hot sauce and they brought us Tapatio Hot Sauce -- yum. His meal also came with choice of potatoes and choice of bread. He opted for the home fries. Our server said the home potatoes are cooked with rosemary, olive oil, and other ingredients that I didn't catch. She made it sound so goood. I was able to try some and I would say it is the best home fries I have ever had. You don't really need ketchup because those home fries had so much flavor. - THICK CUT BACON ($3.50): we all love bacon, but the bacon here is out of this world! The bacon is thick cut and is lighted peppered with black pepper. The bacon was crisp and so good. You MUST order it.  SERVICE was okay. They were nice but very busy. Our drinks weren't delivered until our meals came which was maybe a 10 to 15 minute wait. They did clear our plates from our table right when we finished.   In conclusion, I would definitely recommend this gem of a restaurant to anyone visiting Downtown Phoenix. My friend said it was probably the best breakfast that he has ever had and I can't disagree. We ate like savages haha.",

We had a little trouble getting a table because there were 7 of us, but parties of 3-4 were getting seating rather fast. Totally acceptable, I understand it takes some time to get a table(s) for that many people. They were kind and courteous and kept us informed of when a table would be available. For as small a place this is, and as many people were there, it was managed very well. Servers were constantly walking around filling coffees and waters and our waitress was bilingual which helped my in-laws in ordering. I know it's a small thing but it really helped them out.

Get the chicken apple sausage though. I cant live without that now.   The atmosphere was my favorite part. The tables, chairs, decorations were all cozy and its clear they took great effort to make the place cool af.   The wait was crazy, but i was expecting that i guess.   The staff was cool and chill. There is a small parking lot and a handful of metered spots. Parking is probably the only thing that will make it hard to get back to Matt's. It was a nightmare.",

The blueberry tartness was there, and the lemon sourness was there, but the sweetness of the honey was definitely missing. I didn't drink half of it.

The food is absolutely delicious!   I ordered the special of the day, which was called the \"Classic Egg Benedict\" or something like that. At first glance, its just eggs and Canadian bacon on an English muffin along with some hash browns. However, the taste was absolutely sublime! Much better than any eggs and ham I've eaten at other breakfast type places. They put some sort of creamy sauce on top of the eggs, which really made the difference in terms of taste. It wasn't exactly the most health conscious thing I ate during my trip, but it was well worth it.   I strongly recommend this place if you're looking for a big filling breakfast and don't care about the calories. 5 stars!",

    "text": "I was so disappointed in my whole experience here. I was really looking forward to trying this place and been waiting for a few months to go. My boyfriend was visiting and we thought Sunday brunch there would be great.  We arrived at 830AM and they said a 20-30 minute wait. No big deal, we can do that.  The crowd was moving quickly and the host was efficient at seating people quickly. He came or and said we were next. With the way the crowd was mocking before, we thought we would get seated soon but nope. We wait another 10-15 mins, which didn't make any sense.  We sat down and figured out what we wanted to order. A girl came over a while after we seated to drop off water. She asked if anyone had taken our drink orders and we said no and that we were actually ready to order food.  Waitress was unfriendly and didn't even tell us he specials.   The food was good, don't get me wrong but it's definitely overrated. I travel a lot and love to try restaurants in different cities, this isn't even worth a second visit. Potatoes were way too over flavored with rosemary, it was overpowering.   The omelette is just jut eggs with your toppings folded inside not mixed in and cooked with the eggs. It was eggs with a few things inside, nothing special. Even hotel omelette stations mix the eggs and toppings.  We had to flag our waitress down to give us more water.  When we went to pay, the cashier was very short with me. He was chatting up the person in front of me but was very quiet with me. Half way through the transaction he asked \"how was everything\". It seemed very forced! I said \"things were okay\" and he didn't respond.   Honestly, the food was a good but not worth the terrible service. Small menu and gross bathrooms.  Maybe if the staff was a little nicer I would return to try something else on the menu.  Will not try again.",

This is not a place to go it you want to eat and visit. This place, they seat you, take or order, bring you the check, to go box, clear your plates and if you're still in your seat they ask you if you would like a drink to go. I will say, this place is a well-oiled machine the employee work very well together but for me, when I go out to eat I like to visit.",

Once in, we got French toast and waffles. And they brought out some great jams/jellies as well. The food was excellent.

There was literally NO egg salad in this sandwich. The two slices of bread on the outside where so unnecessarily THICK. I took off one of the slices in attempt to actually taste the measly amount of egg salad that was on my sandwich, but even then, the other half of bread was so rubbery i couldn't tear it with my teeth! I was in awe. Even the guy sitting next to me said something about it. Like \"wow that's a lot of bread.\"   Don't get me wrong, their breakfast is fantastic at Matt's downtown! And maybe even good at the airport as well. But I have had their egg salad before and it was nothing like that.  I almost complained to my server it was so bad. Almost. I can't believe I spent money on like a tablespoon of egg salad. I never ever complain about food, I usually just don't ever return if I don't like it. But this sandwich was so pathetic I actually wanted my money back. Of course I'm so passive I ended up not saying anything. Was just kind of hoping my server could tell by the fact that I barely ate any of it. I should have complained and I regret not doing so. I just hate to. But this was so bad. Won't ever go here again.   I still kind of want my money back. :( Sorry guys!",

Coming all the way to Matts was a stretch for us, living on the west side and having a breakfast place we already love. But...we had heard great things and wanted to check it out. MISTAKE one.   We called and were told there wasn't much of a wait. We arrived and were told it should be pretty quick. I think that's the point where they realized we had kids. This place HATES kids. MISTAKE two.  We waited for 90 minutes! We watched parties come after us, get seated and leave while we were waiting outside. And these were parties of ALL sizes. They even LIED to us and said we were next and sat a party of the exact same size that arrived 20 minutes after us.   We left and went around the corner to the Phoenix Public Market. I doubt that the food here could be good enough to put up with their complete and total bullshit.",

I have never loved this dish before and now may never love it again having sampled Matt's oeuvre.  My countermate recommended the bacon highly.  While bacon with EB is overkill, I must say that, having ordered it, I was entirely satisfied.  It was firm, thick and peppery - Bacon so good that I will be hunting for slab bacon to hand slice and pepper to copy it.  To top this slavishly positive review, even the coffee was excellent.  Though my bill for breakfast was nearly $20, I didn't feel cheated in the least.  It was splendid.  Oh, and did I mention the home fries...?",

P.S. feed the meters. I didn't get busted but lots of others received parking tickets on the street.   We had a variety of meals (breakfast sandwich, cheese omelet, hog and chick and a special of the day) and waters around (for four people).  The meals were good, wouldn't say great.  The ambiance was less than desirable.  It's very loud, very cramped, not very comfortable and rush, rush, rush.  It felt as if they couldn't get your order quick enough and get you out the door even quicker.  We had plans so the speed was ok.  What I later found annoying was that I had been grossly overcharged.  This is partially my fault, as I should have checked the check, but the rushed atmosphere along with my trusting nature, (I just gave her the credit card to settle up, without looking at the check) got me in the end.  Looking at the check later, I realized we received another tables check as there were six meals and drinks on the ticket and we had only four people in our group.  In the end, I was overcharged about $20, not including the 25% tip I left on the overinflated bill.  My fault, just a warning to beware due to the extreme haste at this place.",

We made a comment to the owner she apologized but then we saw the cook cough all over our food. We went there today with our daughter, only a party of 2 was on the list ahead of us. Well once they were sat the hostess sat people that came in after us. When we questioned her about it she said that they only seat party of 3 at their ridiculously tiny tables. Which wouldn't be so bad if they didn't bring every item you order on its own plate. We weren't given an option of the bar or table. Which we would've picked the bar because there is more room and it was available first. They attempted to sit us at the baby table and sat a party of 3 white people at the bar. She was very friendly to the white costumers but not us. My money is green just like theirs. Will not be going back for a long time...please make the little girls that work there wear shorts that are longer than their vagina. Very unprofessional!",

I'll be honest it was good food but nothing amazing, I am just glad there wasn't a wait when we went otherwise I think our expectations would have been much higher. I got the griddlecakes because I read they are a must to try and my husband got the Chop & Chick (pork chop with eggs). The pancakes were good, I would say comparable to the good egg, but I would choose the good egg over Matt's. The husband's pork chop had a lot of flavor with a nice crispy outside served with your standard scrambled eggs and above par hash browns. The one thing we got which I will say was very good would be the thick-cut bacon. It was cooked perfectly and for a side order you got 3 huge slices which was enough for us to share. I would come back here however, I would definitely try the BLT because of that bacon, but I don't see myself waiting more than 15-20min for a seat.",

I can't tell you why - maybe take the most simple foods but make sure they are the highest quality, cook with butter or olive oil and you get perfection?  I don't know the secret but people will wait in line for over 30 minutes to eat OATMEAL there?!  I've eaten there twice - my first review must have been written on the other location. This time I had the simple breakfast sandwich. Two eggs, bacon, cheese on a soft fluffy roll. The bacon is outrageous, thick, peppery yum. The sandwich is really big and luscious.  My older kid gets the basic eggs, potatoes, toast and bacon. The younger got the waffles - incredible light, fluffy and flavorful. I can't remember what my husband got but he was a happy, happy man.  The wait is tough especially in summer heat. I've been approached by homeless folks both times. The last one was hilarious. He asked me for a cigarette and I told him I don't smoke. He looked at me with amazement and asked: How did you quit??? Like we have been the best friends forever and he is in awe in my ability to quit. Ha! I laughed and said I've never smoked. He nicely moved on to the next group.  **I had to edit this as I forgot to compliment the service. I love, love, love how everyone says \"thank you for waiting\". There is no arrogance here. Super attentive service always offering more water or coffee.",

Aaawww it's True and it's a hot min unless u waiting right by the door when they open but that's up to you to decide if all the hype is worth it. I waited close to 40 min @10am on a Sunday so that should tell u. Im not fond of a long wait especially for a simple breakfast because basically I was just to lazy to make it myself. If it's eggs Benedict or some other fancy poached egg saucey type dish than I can understand but ummm no this is ur simple breakfast establishment.     So let's get into the meal;  Love me an egg sandwich and a connoisseur of these tasty impactful little buggers so of course I got the 5 spot. The bacon is so thick and amazing, the cheese is perfectly melted and the huevo was nicely cooked and is nestled in this locally made tasty roll that is so soft w/a pinch of sweetness. I give this egg sandwich a must pick up to go item and eat it in your car or walk home. No need to sit and eat there it takes to long. I do have to say that I think it's super wack home fries nor hash browns come with this sandwich and besides the bacon I can't imagine why pay $6 for a sandwich that doesn't even come with a side of extremely cheap veggie item, which is another 2.95, blasphemy. Anyways I ordered a side cuz my sandy was lonely and gosh darn it they forgot my order. Half way through my egg buddy I realized I still had no cheapy potato shreds in front of me. I had to ask and they still had to make them so u know they was rushed and a lil underdone. Mistake of the waitress not the kitchen staff, which was totally played off and they didn't even hook it up w/a free ice tea or coffee so they get a boo!  Nevertheless this place gets a whatever and if I go again it will always be an order out cuz waiting hella long for nothing wowwing is not the buizness, but if I do ima wear a side braid or bun like everyone else who works there as an ode.  FYI this place really deserves a 2 for long wait, forgetful waitress,  simple way nothing on the menu is to exciting hyped up eats but it gets a 3 only for the egg sandwich deliciousness only! Plus I can't seem to figure out how to get a halfsies .",

And it made our wait 35 minutes verse the 2 hours it would take before which is awesome! The waitress was attentive and got everything out fast which was nice since we had our wild child with us. Restaurant is super loud so it wasn't a big deal when my daughter got hyper. I got the blt this time and it was great the bacons is thick and crispy. I don't like tomatoes so I should have added avacado or cheese for a little more flavor but still one of the best I've ever had. Lots of homeless people around this area which is fine its phx its to be expected but for some reason they really bother you when you are waiting.",

Pros: +excellent tasting food +excellent customer service +locally brewed coffee (from Cave Creek) +thick slices of bacon +fresh squeezed orange juice +real maple syrup +you do NOT feel terrible after eating here, like some places!  I felt energized and ready to take on the day  Cons: -may have to wait for a table, but worth it -no biscuits or biscuits & gravy on the menu -would like to see an all-natural sweetener such as Stevia available -would like to see organic ketchup available as a condiment  Those cons are very minor and aren't even a big deal.

My pancakes were dry and not very tasty although the portion size was huge. They were also crumbly sort of like cornbread which I don't really find to be appealing for pancakes.. They had a very organic \"made from scratch\" taste but not as good as what my mom could make from scratch and she's not a good cook. The jam was very delicious. The lemonade was heavenly. It was very noisy. My husband ordered the porkchop with hashbrown and eggs. He decided his favorite thing was the jam. He normally doesn't like sweets and is a huge meatlover. The porkchop wasn't very flavorful husband thought it was dry too. Both of our menu items could have tasted better. They were quick service was great. I was expecting more of the food. The quality in the ingredients was there I'm assuming organic maybe local? But our breakfast just wasn't that flavorful. Maybe it was what we ordered? After trying our food we both regretted our choices and left disappointed.",

I had heard about this place for awhile and been wanting to try it. We got here around noon on a Friday and there was still a 20 minute wait.  It's a pretty small, bustling place. We were seated near the back and had to pull up a chair at the end for the 5th person. Our server was nice and friendly, brought our drinks and took our orders promptly. I had a scramble with salami and cheese, and I subbed the potatoes for grilled tomato. My other friends got the egg white scramble, the special of the day, which I think was an omelet with pork and cheese.   Everything came out pretty fast which was nice since we were starving. For all the good that I had heard of this place though, I was mildly disappointed. I will say the food tasted good and clean, not greasy or overly salty and buttery. So that was definitely refreshing, but in terms of amazing flavor, it just wasn't there. Got a decent portion for the price though. Honestly, I'd say it's more 3.5 stars than 3, but I don't exactly understand or agree with the hype.",

I also had the \"Hog & Chick\" with bacon and over easy eggs. The eggs were tasty and the bacon was perfectly done, but the star of the show for me was the hashbrowns. They are simultaneously creamy and soft, with a fabulous crust on the exterior.   Service is so efficient and friendly. For example, our table was a little wobbly, so we brought it to someone's attention. And, the guy had a wedge in his pocket so he was able to fix it right then!  The wait can be long, but the neighborhood is cute so you can walk around to kill time. I visited in winter and didn't have to wait out in the hot sun. If that had been my experience maybe I would feel differently about how the wait affects the overall rating.",

Things kept getting in the way but today was the big day! After waiting HOURS in the social security office close by, I became starved. I drove on over and had to find parking behind it in the TINY parking spaces, typical of downtown. I was greeted instantly by a waiter and he gave me plenty of options. I sat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly waitress. I opted for the special and a side pancake. The coffee, was awful. They did not also have cream and only offered milk. I was really disappointed as I like a very simple coffee. My pancake was delicious but the rest was subpar. They only offer one hot sauce and my hash browns were mushy. It was a downtime but the waitresses were all talking amongst themselves eating and the chef staff was in the kitchen being ridiculously loud and goofing off the entire hour I was there. I am really disappointed with my visit and will be sticking to my usual US EGG, breakfast joint. If you're in the mood for pancakes and you are downtown I do recommend this place, other than that... try somewhere else!",

Not a huge deal, as the meters do accept cards or coins.   I loved the Matt's Traditions menu found on the placemat. Today, their feature menu item was the biscuits and sausage gravy... talk about delicious! My boyfriend got the five spot and I would definitely order that on our next visit. Both meals exceptional as well as their friendly staff and service.   It's an epic five stars from this Hoosier!",

But by myself, they gave me a quick seat by the window. My server came and I was a little caught off guard cause she was really cute, actually all the girls that work there are really cute but this one had a big rack and was demonstrating her cleavage wide and loud. I got it, I know it makes her better tips but for some reason it just rubbed me the wrong way and I think I just got really bad vibes from her. I'm here to have breakfast not ogle cleavage. And this is a family place too. Yeah, I know, what does this have to do anything about the food?  Well, I got the hog and chick (with home fries) and ordered the strawberry honey lemonade. She said they were already out (it was 0900!) so I opted for the blueberry lemonade. Well my meal came I start eating. First, I kinda thought my eggs would be bigger, they're not, they're like normal sized eggs. I don't know, is it too much to expect extra jumble eggs at a place called Matt's Big Breakfast? I ordered the thick cut bacon with it and it's good but overcooked. The bacon's almost burnt, actually it is slightly burnt and I'm pretty sure that's the style here, look at all other pictures. That's not the best way to serve bacon. And I like my food slightly burnt but this isn't the best way to serve thick bacon. It being burnt takes away a lot of the flavor especially with thick bacon. It's almost a crime. The home fries, everyone says how good they are. They're not. Why? Because they're cut too thick. They're mixed with rosemary while being cooked and other seasoning which is awesome but because they're cut so thick, you taste more potato than anything else. It almost makes the seasoning non existent. That's not good home fries. Might as well just cut up really thick fries and serve them.   Finally, my server forgot my drink completely. Never served it. I told her as I brought her my bill. She offered to put it in a to-go cup but I declined. At this point I just wanted to leave. So the food was just ok but I think that server really put me in a foul mood. I don't know, I really need to go back and give this place another try. Probably with another server, lol!",

It's also prepared with cracked pepper chucks on the bark (outside of the bacon). Very yummy, I'd go back just to order heaping plates of those slabs of goodness. Coffee was a local roasted bean, couldn't say I liked it, couldn't say I loved it, basic drip coffee, im an expresso man so my tastes are cor stronger coffee. Toast is cut nice and thick! They provided some Blue Berry jam that looked home made, it was defiantly a flavor bomb.  I will be back.",

    "text": "First time grabbing a late breakfast at this downtown spot. We ordered our food and within only a few minutes, I had an amazing Belgium waffle with 2 thick, peppered slabs of bacon sitting before my very eyes. I barely had time to squeeze my lemon slice into my passionfruit iced tea before this feast sat before me.   After I had lightly buttered and drizzled a fourth of my waffle with syrup, I ceremoniously cut a generous piece out and placed it in my mouth. Seriously, my taste buds didn't know what to do. This was one of the best waffles I've had in my life. After my brain had sufficient time to process what was going on with my tongue and this heavenly piece of Belgium, I relentlessly devoured the rest of the waffle in a matter of minutes. I swear people must have thought I was in a food eating contest.   Then it came time to eat the bacon. After a mere nibble from a corner of one of the slices, the two slices that originally came atop my waffle simply teleported into my stomach. Yeah, that's how good the bacon is. It can teleport. Needless to say, I will be finding any excuse to eat here again in the very near future (i.e. tomorrow).",

Side of home fries, delicious, thick wheat toast served with some amazing raspberry jelly, and (based on all of the reviews) I got a side of the bacon.   I don't know where to start. The scramble was great, the sausage with jalapenos were awesome, the home fries were a great complement and the bacon. The bacon was legen-wait for it-DARY!!!  Can't wait to go back, sit at the bar and hang out with Bre H, who gave us some great tips on what to order and kept a smile on our faces!  Last tip: make a reservation if you can, as the line is apparently always long, even for the counter.",

We also ordered the special, which was a chorizo scramble with cheddar cheese and jalapenos, it was to die for. We switched out the tortilla for toast so we could try the preserves based on other Yelp reviews, the flavor was blueberry and it was AMAZING! I couldn't believe how great the hash browns were, they really take pride in them with a cheese filling, no ketchup needed. The food came out really fast and service was friendly.",

The menu, albeit small, has all the breakfast comfort food that most diners have (i.e., waffles, scrambles, pancakes, etc.) I ordered the special which was an egg scramble with jalapenos, ham and cheese. It also came with a side of potatoes, either hash browns or country style.  The best part of my scramble was the succulent ham. I never tasted breakfast ham so good. If you go to Matt's try their ham, it is no doubt, the best I've ever had.  My hashbrowns were fried to perfection: Crispy outside and soft and silky inside.   I also tried their bacon which is a thick cut peppered bacon. I don't prefer thick cut bacon, but if it's your style, you'll most likely love it.  The service was great and the food is awfully cheap. Wish they had more to choose from on their menu though!",

So given the chance to walk right in and sit down on a weekday was such a treat.  The waitress was friendly and bubbly as all of them are.

Where all the good reviews on yelp are coming from is a mystery to me. Coming here Was the biggest mistake we made this morning. It is not a spur of the moment joint. Plan ahead because you will have to wait 35+minutes just to be seated. Not a good place for a party greater than 4. Ladies: there no where to place your purse so you either eat with it on your lap or put on the floor, which is gross. We Waited the time,got seated & had to wait 10 min before anyone took our drink order. Thankfully we placed our food order at the same time. Waited another 8 min or so to get the drinks. Food took longer to come out. With no kids meal options we were forced to order large plates for the children. So big sad face for that. Food came out & the waffle was good, eggs over easy was fine. My daughter's scrambled eggs were fine. My omelette with cheese bacon ham looked promising & then they didn't get eaten because they were not cooked thru in sections. Figured I'd enjoy hashbrowns but they were terrible. Unseasoned crisp outside & straight baby food mush inside. Yuck. My daughter's homefries were ok except half of them had burned bottoms. I love that they use thick cut bacon but hate that they burn it black so it tastes like charcoal. All in all we spent $75 and change (tip not included) for a party of 5 & TERRIBLE food. Don't waste your hard-earned money here. Unless you like paying for bad food- go somewhere else. Not worth it. You don't get what you pay for. Plan on paying for parking because it is all metered.",

My wife and I usually get the 5 Spot, this delicious breakfast sandwich that I could easily eat every day. Then we'll typically get the special and split that, so we're always trying something new and the special has never let us down yet. I wish I could say some of the specials we ordered but I'm bad at remembering things.   Yes there can be a wait, but it's always nice out in the morning, they have a great outdoor seating area and your in an awesome part of Downtown Phoenix. If it's Saturday morning you can even walk over to the Public Market and grab some fresh produce or goods of your own.   Once inside, service is fast, almost too fast. I'm always surprised at how fast they bring out the food. They have these small coffee mugs but they never get empty because staff is always checking on you. It gets a little loud inside but we're always able to keep up great conversation with our table of 5 or 6.   So great food, atmosphere, neighborhood and a spot we'll always be going to!",
