Our 7th person came in and we asked if we could move a small table over to give us room to eat. The waitress was going to allow it but the manager (male) came out to say that we could not have an additional table because he would need it for the upcoming U of A game which was starting in an hour and a half. We were going to eat lunch and have cocktails but decided instead to leave since it was such a burden to serve us. Z Tejas was more than happy to take our business.",

Each TV is designated with what team it'll be playing, so you can plan accordingly.  Service is fine, and the food is pretty average. Of course, you're going to watch a game and get a few drinks, not for the meal of your life, so don't expect too much. Drinks are reasonably priced, and if you're hungry, try the nachos or chips and salsa. There's also plenty of parking, which is good.  I'd go back to watch a game.",

What a pleasant surprise . . . I was able to have the club salad with the dressing on the side, and it fit into the food plan perfectly . . . not to mention that the lettuce was cool and crisp, the bacon was thick with a crisp out side and tender inside, and the amount of other topping to lettuce was perfectly balanced.  The others in the party all had different burgers, and loved them . . . yes the drool was starting . . . especially for the Mushroom Swiss Burger . . . but that will have to wait for another visit . . . damn.  Now, why only four stars if everything was perfect . . . being on the food plan for almost a month had me wondering if it was the lack of restaurant food or if it really was that good . . . I'm betting the latter . . . but I need to come back for that Mushroom Swiss Burger befor I can give this place five stars . . .  Zipps . . . see you again soon . . . only one more week to go.",

But yuck!  Too greasy to eat.  We salted them like we were transporting meat on the open frontier in the pre-refrigerated transport days.  Still unpalatable.  We tried these chicken fingers after refusing to eat the nachos we'd ordered.  HOW do you make bad nachos?   I mean. NACHOS! The meat tasted like fowl boiled in a caldron sometime during the Pre Spice-Wars Middle Ages. We also left the over iced chambord margarita on the table unconsumed and made our way across the parking lot to Z-Tejas to get the real ones.  I've learned my lesson about straying from the Tempe Zip's location.   Our server did her best, but she was playing piano in mittens.  Not a lot she could do with what she was given to work with.

For bar food, it'll suffice, but if I'm not drinking or it's not happy hour, I avoid this place.  For some reason, every Zipps has the worst parking. I think everyone that goes there must drive two cars to get there. Parking is always terrible and small. Go early, get a spot and chill. Happy hour is good in the bar and in the dining area, so no worries about that.  Seriously...grab some golden wings and a 32oz beer. You'll agree.",

    "text": "I want to write a review about this specific Zipps, but more about the gal who served my girl friend Kelly and me the other day. Serena P. (her name was on the ticket and I took a pic to write this)   Serena was amazing. Her service and attentiveness was perfect. Around enough to be completely satisfied with the amount of service and subtle enough to hardly notice she's one it, 100% Just a pleasure.   Kelly was a server for years and subconsciously critiques so much about servers and service in general. To be honest, she even critiques me! She feels it's rude to ask a service to have a burger cut in half, for example. Well, Serena heard us mention Kelly and I split our meals and came back with our burger already cut! It was very thoughtful and absolutely perfect. I was then able to tell Kelly that I was right! Some servers don't mind having your burger cut in half.   Bottom line, Serena was great.  Food: If you come here, make sure to try to bleu cheese with the wings. The golden hot is so hot but has great flavor. My fave is dipping golden medium wings in golden hot and then bleu cheese. Yum! And the sweet jalapeno burger with the turkey patty. Amazingly delicious! Beware of the golden hot. A little at a time.  Drinks: If you like beer and margaritas, then you have to try the beer with a floater. We get Dos Equis floaters with a lime. They'll get you.   Love this place!",

I ordered a beer and appetizer at 4:50.  By 5:52, we still haven't seen our server to order dinner.  I had to walk up to the bar to get another beer.  The server stopped by to take our order at 6:00.  It's 6:53 and she hasn't been back.  This will be our last trip to Zipps.",

Nobody greeted us when we came in the door as if we were not even there. We seated at a table in the bar and it took about  10 minutes before anybody to notice that we were sitting there. They were not busy at all. I kept turning around and looking towards the kitchen. There was a server that touched the back of a male employee who was not our server.  Our drink order was not correct. And we had to sit around and wait for our ticket. Eventually we had to ask another server for our tickets so we could leave.  Sadly to say I will not be returning to this location",

I got her the donut and when we sat down at Zipps they asked us to leave because they don't allow outside food. She's 8! I'm bringing my business(past, present and future), but now I have a bad taste in mouth. It may not be a big deal to many people, but it is to me. I would recommend to anyone not bringing an 8 year old with a donut.",

It used to have good service and decent bar food, but the place just seems to be bringing itself down with really really poor customer service and problem resolution. My last visit I had to walk out. Was seated but no one came to take our drinks after about 15 minutes, mind you the place was completely dead, there were only about 5 tables being used, and there were at least 4 waiters walking around. None of them bothered to come to our side of the restaurant so that we could at least flag one of them down, but going to a restaurant shouldn't require you to have to do so for a simple glass of water. I'm not sure if it was done purposely, but we were the only people that were sat far away from everyone else, but the waiters could clearly see us and would just not come to our table. Whether they're racist or homophobic I would've much rather had them tell me they were going to refuse service, which is their right if they wanted to, than to ignore us and put us in the back the way they did.",

Zipps is known for their wings and burgers and CHEAP 32oz drafts! On any given night you can find one or more of these items on special! Per usual, this location is LOADED with high def flat screen tvs, a shuffleboard table, pool table, Golden Tee machine, and patio complete with a fire pit to huddle around on those cold winter nights (yes that was a joke)!",

They serve you wet plastic baskets with parchment paper setting inside and paper is all wet, unsanitary in the fact that our food will be setting in it.  The french fries were sopping in grease and were over done.  The onion rings were chewy and tough, almost as if they were deep fried a second time.  The salad came right out of  a bag, just lettuce and shredded carrots, not very appealing. There is a lot of competition out there and if they don't change a few things they will not last very long.",

I myself, am not a huge sports bar fan- I'd much prefer the Vig, Garage or something along those lines. However, on game day, especially the Cards, Devils, Wildcats or Suns are playing... it's the place to be.  If you aren't a huge beer fan, try out the Chambord Zipperita. Yum!

Took advantage of the happy hour chips and salsa, on which the guacamole was delicious, not too salty, same with the chips. I can't stand over salty goods that take away from the natural taste. Also took advantage of the beer deals for a couple of bucks!  Nothing too crazy nor unique on draft, but ya can't beat the beers that you're familiar with.  The atmosphere for  sports games is great!! At least 18 TVs (and yes, I counted).  Went for a sandwich from the menu that was different from back home, the chicken focaccia.  I found the proportion to be the perfect amount and the sandwich delicious! This place is a great place to hang out with friends, especially for a game. Loud enough to bring an infant (which we did).

For the most part, though, the service is pretty terrible.  The servers are not that attentive and are not too friendly.  On the other hand, some of the servers do a great job, but there are only a select few.  I can look around and see other servers having dirty looks on their faces to their tables or to their own staff behind there back.  This is not good for business because it is quite annoying having to wait while the servers solve their drama to get any service when our drinks have been empty for 15 minutes.",

    "text": "Today on a visit to our closest Zipps location from work , I traveled with 10 coworkers.  We were having a wonderful time.  The wings were excellent as always!  Yet the service was atrocious.  Our waitress came and brought me a bill with an extra drink I did not purchase.  Easy fix right?  No, that wasn't the case.  A manager (Louie) I think told me I would have to pay the bill for the extra drink since he claimed it hit the table, and it was on my bill.  Apparently he claimed another girl ordered the drink and said it was ok to put on my bill. ???  Well, it appears that is common practice because another patron in our group said it happened on another occasion.  Since it was happy hour, it was an extra $4 charge, no big deal.  However, based on principle alone, I shouldn't be accountable for someone else's drink.  So this manager said he would call the police if I did not pay the additional charge.  He did.  He refused to bring the bill until the dispute was solved.  I was avoided for 20 minutes, and most of the group stayed back with me to resolve the situation.  It was $4, lol. No big deal, someone else thought it wasn't worth the stress and forked over $5 to cover the drink.  While the police were there to monitor the situation Miranda came over to say she was sorry for the inconvenience, and it was beyond her control . I explained that we were waiting for a lengthy amount of time, and this extra charge would affect her tip.  She mouthed off something along the lines it wasn't her fault, but she was my waitress.  Why was this acceptable?   On stress alone and the risk of alienating all patrons who visited with me $4 was a risk this establishment was willing to fight.  As we exited the manager who called the police was conversing with them by the door.  The police followed us out.    It became harassment when we all exited and as I sat in my car getting ready to drive away, a police officer who was there insisted I call for a ride, or an uber.  He asked me if I started the car.  He also said because he was nice he could have waited for me to drive away before pulling me over.  WTF.  Without probable cause other than leaving a sports bar, I was accosted.  Clearly rational and sober I walked over to Starbucks on an adjacent block.  It was $4, I sit here 40 minutes later clearly writing this review.  3 Phoenix Police cruisers have driven by since.  2 police officers stopped in and purchased coffee.  I took it upon myself to offer to buy their drink, and possibly ask questions about the legal limit in AZ.  I had two drinks, and they stated it affects each person differently, and advised me to drink some water before driving off to help clear the system just in case.  I think I'll stay here for another hour or so before heading home, and get some work completed.  Yet, I somehow feel disappointed with how our tax dollars are spent.  We were there to have a good time after a long day.  And we were there without incident for 2 hours.  No food is worth the price of harassment and intimidation regardless of quality.  BEWARE of extra charges on your bills, and have some dignity.  AVOID AVOID AVOID THIS LOCATION.  There are many other Zipps locations that offer superior customer service and management.  But, I must say Buffalo Wild Wings, Long Wongs, and even Applebee's would never have treated us this way.  Disappointed long time customer.   AFTER A WHILE, golden style!",

Clutch a giant beer, or one of their zipparitas , and leave in time for the REAL party to start.   I mean, you could come here late at night to eat, but it's going to be dark, loud, and kinda boring. They've got a pool table and patio, but it's not enough to give this a real dive-bar feel that it's going for.   The drinks are fine. They're inexpensive, and have daily specials...any reasonable person could get plastered here for under $20, which is amazing. Zipparitas get the job done, but taste so strongly of alcohol, it's reminiscent of a mixed drink 19-year-old Taric would have made at a house party.  The food on both visits leaves much to be desired, as on both my visits it was made quite haphazardly...like a pizza with virtually all the toppings dumped on one side, or nachos with golf-ball sized chunks of unseasoned ground beef. Compared to the other location I've visited (Scottsdale), the kitchen doesn't even try.  Overall, I'm not gonna complain if you drag me here, but please don't make me eat here, or make it THE destination. I've got better things to do.",

I noticed the bleu cheese was almost non existent as far as taste, way too little of it after opening my burger up to see what's going on. The fact that there were two patties made it impossible to taste it, once I removed a patty, I could taste it a little more.   We ordered our burgers cooked medium, they came to us well done. It wasn't as dry as you'd expect being that thoroughly cooked, so that was nice. I just ate my burger anyway because I was hungry as hell, and it took quite a while to get to us... I wasn't about to wait any longer. Apparently the waiter didn't put our ticket up for the cook and forgot about it for a little while. We were able to see that from where we were sitting.  The fries were ok as well, not great but not bad either.   It's been a long ass time since I've ordered anything but water at a restaurant, so I was kind of surprised at $5.00 for two iced teas.   Other than forgetting about our ticket, our waiter did a pretty decent job. Neither of our drinks bottomed out, and he checked up on us fairly often.   Overall though, $24 for two burgers and drinks that weren't that great is enough for me to consider going somewhere else next time. I'm not really interested in trying anything else on the menu, or seeing if I get my food faster next time.",

Tonight, we ordered two baskets. The first one was delicious as usual. We dive in to the second basket only to find it hot instead of medium. Uh oh! No big deal right? I'll just have the waitress replace them with what I ordered. NOPE!  I told the waitress the issue and she was nice enough. She said she'd take care of it. A few minutes later I was brought a side of mild sauce and some ranch. I was told,\"don't worry, we won't charge you for that.\"  Really? I don't use ranch. And mixing the mild with the hot does not make medium. Not to mention the flavor is completely different. When I politely asked to have the wings replaced I was abruptly denied. It's \"against their policy\" to replace wings. How is that against policy? I order one thing and got another. It's against policy to fix your mistakes? I then proceeded to tell them if they won't replace them then take them back and remove the item from my bill. Denied again. They forced me to pay for an item I did not order which they wouldn't replace. RIDICULOUS!!!! I could not believe how poorly we were treated. This was by the store manager! Needless to say we will be finding a new spot to enjoy wings.   PS This experience is also combined with the fact that zipps just raised their prices on everything on the menu. The wings are now 2 dollars more than they were. The quantity and quality remains the same.  Zipps is not what they used to be.",

Ten minutes later we ordered, two orders of wings and a house salad to come out before. Twenty minutes later I asked our server if my salad was going n the way, in which she responded I don't know. She went on to say this is how it works. We ring in the tickets and they make them in order....weird she found it necessary to explain this to me. A few minutes goes by and she drops the salad off and keeps walking, no dressing delivered with the salad. We observe five servers and a gentleman later found to be the manager walk by the table. A random server stopped by the table and asked if we were okay. We explained what was happening and she went and got our server, whom at this point was someone different. At 9:43 we received our two orders of chicken wings. As they dropped off the wings they knocked over the dressings we waited a long time for. I've been here before and while it is never great most of the people we were here seemed to not care. After it was all said and done the manager says yea I won't be here after Sunday but you can talk to another manager next time you're in.

Again i was denied... So fine i just won't have anything to drink with my meal. My boyfriend ordered an ice tea and it was cloudy and stale. It was far too old to be offering to a customer. Ok that was strikes1-3. Then we order or food. 20 minutes later when it finally shows up EVERYTHING was cold because this \"server\" left it sitting under a heat lamp. Cheese on nachos was cold and hard and my fries were so stale that they were nit edible. So we sent our food back along with three other tables around us. So... My boyfriends food comes back out and i wait another 5 minutes for my food. Now mind you the other 3 tables had already gotten their food. So as i sit and wait i ask to speak with the manager. Anthony come out and he is mortified at the lack of customer service and respect. He comps our food for us which was very nice of him. BUT!!!  When i finally get my food its not right and i ask the server why there was no bacon on my sandwhich... She states the club sandwich does not come with bacon. Ok wait then why did the first one have bacon? She wouldnt bring me a menu so i pull it up online. Sure enough... Theres bacon on a club... So i speak with Anthony again and he is <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdumbfounded.so&s=a1ec6647ade1c081538e053f019b0ea66d004feaf13f339078f869230654135d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">dumbfounded.so</a> his server is useless and just didnt want to do her job and his kitchen staff doesnt know how to make a basic club sandwich and nachos??? This was the most pathetic experience ive had in a restraunt in a VERY LONG TIME. Poor Anthony asked us to give them another chance but why in the world would anyone ever lower their standards and return to a restraunt that is lacking in leadership and professionalism? Your better off buying a 6 pack and grabbing McDonalds at this point... If you want a real good experience go to the one on union hills. You wont be disappointed... They're managers and staff are all on the same page.",

I have tried a few other things on the menu but nothing compares to my favorite cheat meal from zipps of wings,fries and a side salad with ranch!   However after my last visit I will not be going back! The service was horrible-- from the moment we got there our waitress was very rude and we could all tell very unhappy we were a party of 8. I am not sure what happened to customer service but she had none! It took forever to get even a glass of water! She didn't smile once it was weird and awkward. She may have been having a bad day but thats none of my business. Her service was awful!   I should have learned the last few times things had happened like my brother leaving his wallet there calling them asking them to hold it and when he got there it was no where to be found or the time we went for my aunts birthday and they forgot to inform us or show on the bill that gratuity was included and allowed us to tip 20% more on a 500$ bill. At the end of the day Zipps and shady. To be honest this place deserves no stars.",

Everything was fine and he offered to make me a new batch and I declined because I still ate them. \"Didn't want to drive back over there to get a new order\" I told him it was fine I just wanted to let someone know because it didn't seem like a mistake but more so they just gave me wings that were already made. He said he would talk to his staff and offered me $10.00 in Zipps bucks for my next visit. I told him I didn't want them and just wanted to let someone know about my experience. Right after I said that he didn't say I'm sorry or thanks for bringing it to my attention or even thank you he just hung up the phone. I don't know if he got upset because I declined the Zipps bucks but, I wasn't really all that upset until that phone call. Might not go back to this location again.",

    "text": "I wish I could give this place 0 stars.  My god, the server really ruined a fun night out for my group.    A large group of friends and I decided to meet here to celebrate two birthdays and watch the ASU game.  By the time I arrived there were probably about 15 to 20 people.  I sat at a table and when the server arrived I asked for a beer and to start a tab with just my boyfriend and I.  IMMEDIATLY the server coughed up an attitude and said everyone was on one tab, sorry.  Since I had just arrived I didnt see a reason why I shoudnt be allowed to start my own tab, so she let me, but not without a couple snarky comments to our table.  My friends let me know that she had been rude from the very beginning, when there was only 4 people to start with.    Anytime she came by the table (which wasnt all that frequently) a couple people were ready for another round.  People would start ordering and she would huff and puff and complain that things were getting just too darn complicated.  Perhaps she could remember things easier if she would have written our order down.    Now let me just say that I can understand a servers frustration with big groups.  I work at a bar myself and things can get complicated.  Perhaps if she reads this review she'll learn that most people want seperate checks, and its just easier to assume that from the beginning to keep things clear.  Also someone commented that she was the only server on the patio.  SHAME ON THE MANAGEMENT for having one server serve a busy patio on a saturday night; not to mention the fight and ASU game were on to make it even busier.  Remember that SEPERATE tab I started with my card for my boyfriend and I?  Well it turns out she just decided to throw a bunch of our beers onto the other tab because she couldnt keep things straight.....again, writing things down would really have helped out.    I don't know if the server was new or what, but she was disorganized and incredibly rude.  I couldnt believe how much attitude she was giving us...isn't a large tab a good thing?  I've never before had a server who literally rolled her eyes and walked away from patrons who were looking to spend money!!! UNBELIEVABLE.  WORST SERVICE EVER.",

Also adding to the weird atmosphere is the children sporadically placed in an otherwise sporty bar.  The food is about average to poor.  The wings are decent but could use a little more zip in the sauce.  Definitely not original or exceptional.  The burgers are odd because the meat is actually pretty good but its put in this cheap mcdonald's like bun and all you get is a couple slices of red onion.  First of all, why would you want 2 slices of red onion and what about the usual lettuce and tomato?  Pickle anyone?  The fries are like In and outs of Phoenix area - dry, dark, and shrivelled.  The onion rings are like plump versions of French's onions, the things you put on top of green bean casseroles.    It seems like a fun place, and I'd love to find something that's great there, but the food is definitely not a draw for me at this point.  At any location.",

When they came out- I ate a fry. Took the Bun off the burger- looked at my husband and said. \"I didn't order this.\" But it was the burger with bbq and onion rings on it. It actually was my second choice so I decided to keep it.     My husband noticed they brought him half/half fries and onion rings. He didn't order that but -whatever.    server comes back- says sorry these weren't yours, we mixed them up. I start to say- I touched the burger-she was gone. It's very loud in Zipps- BUT When a customer is speaking to you- don't rip the food away and go. My husband said, well, you tried to tell her.     My point was- I don't want to receive food other people have fingered.eww. And for that reason I will not eat at Zipps again. The food was ok- no complaints on taste.  The place is for sports watching and drinking anyway. Good crowd for the Stanley cup............",

I asked her what she said and she repeated herself. I ask for the manager and he told me he didn't think there was anything wrong with what she said.

We were there on Memorial Day & we had the BEST service ever. I feel terrible for not remembering her name but she has short brown hair, & is a petite girl. Absolutely wonderful. Efficient, nice, quick thinking. We got wings & we are kinda particular about the crispyness & we told her that & the wings came out PERFECT. Take my advice & order double crispy. When we got our Togo box, she brought a lid for my extra ranch which i forgot to ask for, but she didnt! Little things like that are what point out an awesome server to me. It just shows how much attention she's paying. Only complaint, music was WAY too loud. One song came on & I could barely hear myself think. But other than that silly little thing, great time.

We were here for almost hour and a half waited forever to get seated, waited forever for our waitress to take our orders/drink orders, we waited 45 minutes for our food to come out, just for our food to come out cold, and stale.  The fries were not edible, they were soggy like they were sitting there forever. Our sandwiches were cold, and the bread was stale and also not edible to eat. The wings were cold, and the salad was disgusting. Our waitress brought us our onion wings last because she wanted them be 'fresh' well when we got them they WERE STILL COLD!!  After all our food came out we had our little baskets, those were greasy and not clean at ALL. So our waitress came out with new ones. But yet again they WERE still greasy and not clean.  I do not recommend this location AT ALL.  Pretty upset because this is one of my favorite restaurants, and now might not come back now because of the service and the food",

    "text": "TERRIBLE SERVICE!!! BEWARE!!! THEY MAY CALL THE POLICE ON YOU!!!  Last night I had a great time enjoying happy hour with my coworkers. The food was great and the company was even better (10 of us). Once we were getting our tabs, I paid mine with no issue on my bill, but one of my coworker's was being coerced to pay for an extra drink that he did not purchase by the manager. Even the waitress was surprised that it was happening, apologetic and vouching for us, but it was now over her head.   It was not about the drink itself since it was a 4 dollar Zipparita that each of us could have paid a couple of quarters for. It was about the principle that Zipps on 16th st. and Bethany Home CALLED THE POLICE because my coworker refused to pay for a drink he did not purchase that amounted to four dollars!!!  In the end, another coworker just gave $5, the police showed up, and we were off vowing to never go to this establishment again.   Its not over yet folks. The police then tell my coworker who was being harassed to make sure he gets an uber or a ride home to save the police from having to pull him over even though he (tall and broad) only had two drinks and was drinking water throughout our time there (almost four hours).   All I have to say is that, \"the customer is always right\" does not apply here, maybe they run by the slogan, \"the customer is always guilty and should be sent to prison for $4 dollars.\"   In the end, you can see that I never write YELP reviews, but NO ONE deserves to be treated this way and for that I will write it.",

Because they raised the price of their once wonderful chicken wings on happy hour by $2 and reduced the count to ten.  More for less .  The wings still taste as good as they did before, which is nice but unfortunately without the allure of that happy hour wing special, I don't think I'll be coming back.   More people other than myself may agree with this as it was quite slow inside.  Service gets an ok rating, the hostess was gone when we arrived and that took some time to get seated but the waitress was nice. Time to find a new wing spot.",

Tonight we brought a large party at an early hour, intentionally knowing the place would not be too busy to handle us.  Sure enough there were plenty of open and empty tables.  Fitting us in should not have been a problem.  But the manager made it a problem.    The manager was so rude and hostile to us it was unreal.  He was clearly inept to handle a large group.  I have worked in the restaurant business for many years and I was appalled at how he treated many members in our party.  The servers handled the situation with grace and ease, it's unfortunate their manager couldn't learn from them.  We tip well, we were not difficult or demanding and easily brought in over $350 in an hour and a half for 20 people. We should not have been treated so poorly.  I have never taken the time to complain about anything on any customer review page.  But this situation warranted it.  Bottom line, don't go here if you have a big group.  I won't ever bring a large group back again to this Zipps location.",

    "text": "I am the president of the local alumni chapter for a large university.  Our club is 28-years-old, and we have game-watching events every Saturday during football season, as well as for basketball games in the winter.  Our club moved to this Zipps location starting with opening day in early September 2011.  We always confirm that we are coming earlier in the week so that they know our game time and will be prepared.  Within two minutes of when I arrived yesterday, one of their waitresses complained to me that I could not be at one of the tables in our normal area.  When I explained to her that we bring an average of 40 people to every game on Saturdays, she said that was OK and walked away.  She went up front and talked to another person, who then came over to me in an aggressive manner.  When I told him that we usually get 30-50 people to events, he told me that was too many people for any one school to have there.  He stated that if we have too many people rooting for our team, then that means other people who want to come in and watch another game will not be able to sit in the main area in the middle of the floor.  He kept getting more upset, and twice I had to back away from him with my arms in the air to tell him that I did not go to Zipps to look for a fight and that we would comply.    As our members were forced to allow certain tables to sit empty, more club members continued to enter the facility.  They proceeded to sit down at tables that were deemed off-limits for our club members and got chased away by this same manager or one of the waitresses.  The only way that we had enough room for new arrivals is because we had people leave during the first half.  People were already angry.    I had planned on eating lunch there but did not order any food, in part because I did not want to give them the satisfaction, in part because their food really isn't that good, anyway, and in part because my stomach got quite upset after they picked the fight with me.  I hated to give them any money for beer whatsoever, but I needed something to calm my nerves.  Other members just drank water and would not order food.  Some people were talking about going to Taco Bell for lunch, but I'm not sure if that ever happened.  They may have just gone hungry.  I was worried that if we got too excited, someone would come over and tell us to be quiet.  There was only one good waitress on staff, and she came by our table to let us know that she was being sent home early.  Of course, all the other ones were kept on shift, so I hope she did not get in trouble for fraternizing with members of Zipps new enemy.  The ironic part is that no one else ever came in to sit at the tables from which we were so rudely removed.  In fact, in the second half, the entire room was empty, except for the people who remained from our club.  I hope that next Saturday, the entire place is empty.  Never in a million years would I have imagined that we would get chased away in such a bizarre, abrupt, rude manner.  The person who set the event up spoke with their general manager during the game, and he said that he would have a word with the culprits.  But if he really cared, he would have addressed our group in person instead of hiding in another room and would have apologized and let us know that we were still welcome.  The fact that he did not of this shows that this attitude is pervasive throughout their organization.    I never thought that any place would ever do this to any club that lets them know in advance that we're coming, shows up very regularly with good numbers, behaves well, and provides much-needed revenue for the bar and the wait staff.",

First, the GM Damon scolded my husband, myself and our 10+ friends like unruly children for asking if we could have the misters on outside in 90 degree weather. Then the GM proceeded to joke loudly with patrons across the patio about the amount of bleach that needs to be used to clean lately because of all the blood (referring to the recent shooting that occurred here)! When I went to the front counter to grab a business card I saw him and asked what his name was to which he rudely responded \"Damon. Want me to give you the number to Corporate.\" A manager should know how to talk to people and solve an issue so that patrons come back, not challenge them to call corporate. I don't know what this guys power trip was but clearly there is a reason he is the closing manager on a Sunday night. Perhaps Zipps should look into the type of people it calls \"managers\" and provide them with proper training. We have been coming here since this place opened and lately it has really gone down hill. Very, very disappointing.",

The hostess asked if I could \"get more people?\". She said I could sit in the bar which was overfilled or the patio instead.  I said no to the patio and said I would be happy to sit at the bar if she could find seating for us (there was none). She stared at me blankly, confusion. I then asked if we should leave instead of being seated at the available table, response was silence. Just a blank stare. We turned and left. As we drove off to find another sports bar I decided to call and let a manager know that I was displeased. I called and spoke to Jason. Jason said he heard the entire exchange and that it was my fault because I didn't give them a chance.  I assume Jason is one of the owners children, no other explanation for someone that inept hanging on to a management position anywhere. My wife, son and I will no longer be seen at Zipp's. Way to go Jason!  Side note- Zipps- Please listen- your patio is a nasty smoke hole. No one that isn't smoking or with a smoker would sit out there. I would love to kick it on the patio when the weather is nice, but you've sold the entire space to smokers, so not very friendly to anyone else out there. (Not bashing on smokers, Zipps says it's a smoking section so no foul on you).",

Okay, maybe there's no servers, I go to bar and am immediately greeted by a nice, friendly bartender.  I sat back down and realized the server was too busy chatting with her friend a table away to be bothered with me.  My friends arrive back, and tell them to go to the bar because that is where I started the tab.  The same chatty server sees my friends ordering at the bar, and quickly walks over.  She asks them if they need a drink, and they tell her that we have tab at the bar.  She says,\" Yeah, but I am the server in this area... this is my section.\"  Huh??  Well then, honey, maybe you should stop flirting with men much too old for you and help your customers.  After we got our first round.. NO ONE came to clean off glasses.  I had to bring our dirty glasses to the and the bartender was very apologetic.  Unfortunately, Zipps is the ONLY sports bar in the area with ample TV's, so if you find yourself there... GO TO THE BAR!!!!  (UPDATE!!!!)  Have since been back and the servers seem to have gotten their act together.  All smiley and made me feel welcome.   So I gave them two more stars.... if it continues to be good I will eventually give the place 4 stars, but they gotta earn it.  This is real life and not every one gets a trophy at the end of the season!",

The capacity is def not like the one on Indian School. They have a good section of drinks and beer, it has consistent food and it has speedy service. Alot of regulars for sure and good mix of people can be found on game day, from families with small kids, to 20 somethings. The place can get packed, but have never had to wait. Will continue to come back.",

After dinner, went into bar area to shoot a game of pool and were asked to leave because my younger son wasn't 21. I find this ridiculous since Arizona law says servers must be 19 to serve alcohol. We were there as a family, weren't drinking and just wanted to have a fun family night. I won't be spending my money here any more.",

The food was delicious, several friends got burgers and they looked big with a great heap of fries, they said they loved them. My husband got the wings and said he would eat more but he was stuffed, he liked how saucey they were and meaty, he's a wings guy so I'll take his word for it. I got the bbq ranch salad, it was a large serving, much bigger than most salads at other places and very good, I plan on going back soon to try it again. Our server was a really nice guy, very helpful, refilled drinks often and talked with us about our night etc. We had a great night all together, even our daughter was happy and content with her food, no complaints from us as I know it was on the later side and they didn't mind our 2 yr old...",

    "text": "I am a hugeeeee fan of Zipps!! Their golden medium wings are so saucy and full of flavor and the perfect amount of spice. Their ranch,I could drink. It is delicious!! Their fries are the best in town however their onion rings are hit or miss. We went a couple days ago and had the best onion rings out of the 50+ times we have been there. Fully breaded and actually had a crisp to them. Other times they are soggy with undercooked batter or have no breading and  are burnt lil onion rings. But I can never go there and not get fries and onion rings! Now don't get me started on their \"Zipparitas\"...best margaritas everrrr!! Must have if u go to Zipps!! Service is pretty good. Takes a while to get your bar drinks sometimes but they are attentive for the most part. Zipps is a great place for happy hour and reverse happy. I think one of the top 3 in phx for sure. I would like to see them put cool toys in the dinosaur game. My kid was excited to win a spongebob squarepants (plastic) ball. When she opened it, inside was a lil mini plastic body of Mr. Krabs. He didn't even have a head. It had a lil plastic Lego connect kind of ball where his head should be...I guess maybe his head is in another ball in the pit. Lol $1 for that? My kid looked at me like what am I supposed to do with this. *smh put some cool things in that dinosaur game for the kids to grab. ;) we will continue to be regulars tho!",

    "text": "As a rule, I don't bother leaving negative reviews, but this place deserves an exception. We visited Zipps on a weekend night, hoping for some decent late-night food and reasonable service. We got nothing of the sort.   SERVICE FAIL: Our server spent most of the time we were there groping all over her boyfriend, who was seated in the booth ahead of us. By the time we were ready to order, most of the other servers had gathered around his booth to gossip and chat with our server.   At one stage, he actually turned around and looked at us, and asked our server if she shouldn't be concerned about looking like she wasn't working. She laughed and dismissed his question, saying \"Scotty went home a while ago. I can do whatever the f*** I want!\" I can only assume \"Scotty\" is a manager, and he must be so proud of the staff who all cackled at her response.   After the laughter died down, she took our order and returned to pawing the guy in the booth ahead of us. A different server eventually brought out our food.  FOOD FAIL: I ordered the club sandwich. What I got was two slices of questionable lunchmeat, two pieces of cold bacon, a tomato slice and some brown-around-the-edges lettuce on barely-toasted white bread. With a toothpick. Just a hint, Scotty, A toothpick does not make it a club sandwich.   I chose the sweet potato chips as my side, which were horrible as well. Chips should not be soft and greasy.   My dinner companion ordered the chicken caesar salad. Nothing to see here. Dump some greens into a bowl, pour on caesar dressing, throw on some overcooked, leathery chicken meat and send it on out.  CONCLUSION: If all you want is a basket of fried appetizers, huge mugs of cold domestic beer and some screens on which to view your favorite teams, this might be the right place for you. If you have any desire at all for quality of food or service, don't waste your money or time.",

Not many sports bars go out of their way to keep customers happy, like Zipps.  Update: Still decent but could be better, doesn't seem like they want to make the atmosphere better. It's a pain to get a specific game on outside and to get volume is a real pain in the arse. Love the location but they could really make it better.  Dysfunctional! Hard to get games outside, service isn't very good, the 40 st location is way better, our group is taking our business elsewhere, a shame to because the location is great.

Food is decent as far as bar food goes, but I can never get over the service.  First, always have to sit at different tables because the waitress cannot separate the bill from person to person.  Second, if you can get your waitress to come over, the order usually shows up wrong.  Every time I'm there, I have to walk up to the bar to get another drink.  Also shotty service there too.  Drinks are too weak (and I'm a lightweight) and you are waiting for an obscene amount of time.  The only reason I go over there is when a friend of mine wants to meet up there as she lives right around the corner.  It's merely convenient, nothing more.  We're actually thinking of ditching the place all together...  If management would just get their waitresses trained on manners, promptness and accuracy, the place would be great.",

And I had the pleasure of destroying a basket of chicken skewers! Dang those are so good! They're different than most chicken strips/fingers in that they're not overly battered. For a strip of fried chicken, they're surprisingly light.  Decor is pretty nice, brick walls all around. Partition between bar area and sit-down area. And it's nice that there's a good mix of people.

Awesome. -Oh, and they serve giant beers in mugs the size of your head.   I'm really happy Zipps joined the neighborhood.

But even if I wanted to, the service left SO MUCH to be desired I probably wouldnt have gotten far. This place has certainly gone down hill from when they first opened up so my suggestions are this...#1. When there are sporting events going on, get more help #2. I love that the staff likes each other, however, dont use work as your social outlet. Hugging and chit chatting are best left to off hours. #3 Management needs to step up and do that. Manage. #4. I can get ignored at the best of places. I certainly would not go out of my way to do it here. Service is priority - that is why people go out and spend their money! #5. Get the good food back. I wont got back at this point - there are a ton of other places I can go and get better food, better service.",

The first time my hubby and visited was also the first time to try their golden wings. Can we say \"best wings ever\"? At least they are IMO. I do not, however, like their fries. Soggy blahness. Onion rings - good.   The second time we visited was on hubby's birthday. The parking lot was packed and we were in doubt that we'd get a table quickly. But to our surprise there were still a few open tables. This time I had the pepper jack focaccia (chicken, bacon, avocado, pepper jack, garlic mayo). It was sooooo cheesey and delicious. It also came with a side of some sweet jalapeno sauce. It was good, but a bit too sweet. Our friend had the chicken fingers which he was a bit disappointed with. They were battered with that smooth type of batter (I don't know what it's called) and were not very crispy at all. Our entree orders took sooo long that he was able to (after trying our golden wings) switch from regular buffalo to the golden stuff. Friend casually mentioned that it was husband's birthday in front of our waitress and she exclaimed \"oh! Then you get a free desert or shot!\" He couldn't decide on a shot, so told her to surprise him. She brought him a chocolate cake shot. How fitting!   The Chambord Zipparitas get 5 stars all on their own. These things are delicious! Small blended margaritas for only $3 during happy hour! And boy do they pack a punch! I guess that's why there is a limit of 3? Hahah. Other HH drink/food specials are awesome as well!  I hate that this is the closest Zipps to my 67th Ave/Happy Valley home, but on the other hand, that may be a good thing for my health and wallet.",

I will definitely be here again for the golden wings and try the Philly spring rolls.",

No refills were offered and no questions of whether we even liked the food or not.  I will admit the wings are great, good texture and flavor. However their sad excuse for New York style pizza is a completely different story. The crust literally cracks when you try to pick it up, the sauce taste like diced tomato out of a can, it's chunky in fact. Lastly it was just the most bland pizza I've ever eaten.   Definitely won't be ordering anything off their menu other than the wings.",

We were alone on the patio when the waitress brought our drinks and asked for a card to hold. He asked why they needed a card to hold, since it has never been an issue, even while on a packed Friday night. Gal said teenagers have been running out on their tab. We are late 30's early 40's. So I gave her my card. She was nervous and kept rambling on about it. Making no sense, repeating herself. I don't think we look young enough to be considered teenagers anymore. He is black and fully sleeved; I am off work, makeup smeared, but able to foot my bill. We left full drinks on the table and came to the location that is closer to my house and offers the service we sought out. Looks like I wont have to travel far for what I want and can afford to pay for.",

If you don't have a big appetite, I suggest you tell the waitress you don't need a triple layer of fish.  This goes for all sandwiches and burgers.  Apparently, Zipps gives you double or triple layers of meat on the burgers and sandwiches unless you request otherwise.",

We spoke to manager when he checked in after we were done eating and let him know our complaints. He gave us $10 off next meal even though we said we were just discussing not coming back. No discounted meal or fresh fries. Then we waited another 20 minutes after our waitress provided bill for change. She never came to pick up our bill even though she passed by several times. We chose to leave exact change and ZERO tip. They remained just as busy when we left as when we came in. You should never be too busy to check in with tables. ITS YOUR JOB.

    "text": "Really disappointed with the lack of good customer service fro Zipps in general. We spend probably $30 per week across several Zipps locations, so it's seriously sad that my review is over 3 bowls of chili...  On Thursday last week, we ordered take out from Zipps. When we got home, they had gotten our order wrong. We called to let them know, and since I'm 9 months pregnant, I'm not really interested in having to drive all the way back to the restaurant for them to give us the right food. We asked for a refund, but they said their POS system doesn't allow them to give refunds so instead we could get \"Zipps Bucks\" to use on a future order. Ok, fine, whatever.  Fast forward to Sunday. We ordered 3 bowls of chili to go, and when we got home with them, each one was only half full. Again, I called and said at this point two mess ups in a matter of days was unacceptable and asked for a refund again. The manager gave me the phone number of their corporate office and said that Tiffany would be able to help with the matter. I called Tiffany this morning and told her the story, so she told me she would \"research\" the incident with her ops team and get back to me. She called me several hours later to tell me that since we had eaten the chili, they were not going to give us a refund. She also said that they did in fact give us the correct amount of chili for our order, but the cups they serve it in are just oversized. I told her that every single week when I order chili from other Zipps locations, the same cup is filled to near the top. She said those other locations were clearly doing it wrong and she was still not going to give us a refund (oh, btw the chili costs $5 per bowl, so this is a refusal of a refund of $15 for a customer who spends over $1500 per year at their establishment...)  Want to know the best part? Tiffany told me over the phone that she is the Director of their corporate office, so there's no sense in me talking to her boss (the owner) because he sides with her and this was their decision together. Guess what her title actually is? Director of Marketing and Public Relations... Interesting way to treat a customer when you're in charge of PR...  It's a shame. Zipps is one of our favorite places to go. But the fact that their customer service is living in an alternate reality where a justifiably upset customer gets treated like garbage is really not a solid way to run a business. Hence why almost all of their locations are rated 3 stars or lower on Yelp.   For the owner: if you're reading this, I highly suggest taking better care of your most loyal patrons.",

Rude manager, horrible service, long wait for food and when we got the food the onion rings and fries were soggy.  The nacho chips were soggy as well...the server forgot part of the bar order. This is was the second time visiting Zipps so I did give it another try but I know I will not be back and would not recommend this place.  One reviewer got it right...'if you sit at the bar and order a pitcher of beer and a burger you might be satisfied but don't bring a group of 5 or more'...you'll be stuck with horrible service and worse, the food. Sorry, hope the review remains on Yelp.",

    "text": "We've gone here several times in the past couple of months, usually around 8:00 on Sunday evening.  I'm not sure if it's because of the day and time but they are typically understaffed, service is slow and the food is poor.  The burger I had last night tasted like it had been under a heat lamp for a while, along with the onion rings.  My wife's cup of chili was supposed to be \"spicy\", but was neither spicy nor hot, as in temperature.  Her fries also seemed to suffer from being scraped from the bottom of the pile.  Next is the noise.  I know its a sports bar and it's going to get noisy, but why play loud rock music on top of that?  We couldn't hear ourselves think and when we asked for the music to be turned down they did it, but only for about five minutes.  There were about six couples at tables, and another dozen or so at the bar, and nobody was watching the games or, it seemed, listening to the music.    Lastly, no Wi-Fi.  What's up with that?  I asked and they said it's because they don't want people \"camping out\".  People camp out in a sports bar?  Really?  Gave this place several chances but likely won't be back.",

Great happy hour, reverse happy hour, and weekend specials. Fun atmosphere, bar games, and lots of TVs. I just named nine reasons why this place is great. I could go on.  Fantastic chicken strips, onion rings, and fries. They even have the best dipping sauces, like the ranch or the blue cheese or the jalapeno sauce. We're at twelve now. Want 15? Ok. The Zipparita, 32oz domestics on HH, and John Dalys. I like to give three examples at a time.  For example: Nice staff, reliable take out, convenient shuttle to games. 18. To be continued...",

Someone who works here seems to think that the majority of the people going here weren't coming for the specials. Guess what you're wrong.

You get a weird mix of cheap, lost in the middle of their 20-somethings, and semi-businessmen who want to catch the game after a long day of semi-conducting business. Not my cup of tea.

    "text": "Over this place. OVER. I've had too many ups and downs but today was the straw that broke the camel's back. We came in and there was a wait. We waited for about 15 minutes and noticed that there were 4 single guys each taking up a booth- by themselves- in the bar. It was almost comical watching them nurse their beers and play on their phones. While we were waiting on a table so we could get our hangover grub on, we noticed that there were two empty tables (4 tops). Not sure how long they'd been sitting empty, but that was frustrating.   I guess the manager noticed and came over and asked if we'd mind sitting with some other people at those tables. I, being hungover and not wanting to be judged whilst I shoveled unhealthy greasy wings and a burger in my gullet, said no. I explained that we were just there to eat and would not be camping out to watch Sunday football. Why couldn't we have one of the two empty 4 tops? He wouldn't budge and said that's the way they were seating people. I call bullshit. The last time we were in on a busy Saturday, we sat by ourselves at a booth, ate, and left. No fuss. I didn't even complain when my sweet jalapeno burger came out and was missing the freaking jalapeno sauce. I was too hungry and just ate it and said nothing.   Well, I am tired of making excuses for Zipps. Their fries are often flacid. The service is hit and miss. The beer selection sucks. Now they won't even fill their own tables? What the heck?Am I decked out in NFL gear like I'm going to pretend your restaurant is my living room? No, I just wanted to eat. But I had to take my money elsewhere to do that. We weren't the only ones who chose to leave either, I watched 3 other couples go while we were waiting. I'm still pissed we weren't told up front that's the way they were going to do the seating. Instead, we had to stand around and wait. At least those single guys at the 4 booths by the bar provided comic relief.",

Some even run shuttles to and from spring training games.  Back to Bethany Home. This location is supposedly the newest. We sat in the dining room and it probably had 12+ tvs.  We ordered some appetizers and they came out quickly. Decided to stay for dinner and everything was correct and tasty.

When they did come out, I asked the server about them and he politely told me if I tried them and didn't like them he would take them away. Gave it the old college try, and they were not for me. Server made good on his word and took the rest of the basket away. Granted I took a bite of one, and the others were all still there. When the tacos I ordered came out, the manager decided to sit there and ask me why I didn't like the cheese egg rolls, and then proceed to tell me everything on the menu that came prepared the same way so \"I know next time I come not to order them.\" First, I was a supervisor of a restaurant and I know things don't always land perfectly, but I think it's rude to come out and \"remind\" someone what not to order when they come back.   After that it seemed like the server himself was annoyed or on edge, and that just made the experience even more unpleasant. The tacos I had were salty, and the meat was dry, but I honestly didn't want to bother with another complaint. The manager would've made my dining experience even more unpleasant.   I have been hesitant to come to this location even though it is down the street from me, and I had a friend who worked here a year ago and did not hear good things.

I tried ordering one of their nightly food specials, and they were out, I was not upset, stuff like that happens. So instead, they asked me to order anything else off the menu and it''l be comped.

Our server forgot to put in one of the orders and didn't realize it until the food came out. Okay, mistakes happen but no apology. In the meantime a large group arrived nearby and got their order in. You would think that our server would tell the kitchen to make the order she forgot on the fly, but no. She actually used the group as an excuse for an even longer wait. So now, we have all finished and our friends order comes. Nothing awkward about five people watching him eat and feeling rushed!  You can guess what we were expecting, \"so sorry for the wait, the sandwich is on us\". $8.50. NOPE!  We had to inquire about getting it removed and we were actually told no. We then asked for the manager who also told us no! She wasn't even friendly about it. She said there was nothing she could do about it. Really, the General Manager Susie couldn't simply take off the sandwich or discount it?  We even asked if our server had told her that she forgot to put the order in of whicsaid \"no\"! Unacceptable! We simply took it out of our servers tip.    I have noticed the recent huge increase in poor reviews at Zipps thanks to management. I wonder why?  I guess the General Manager doesn't care about taking money right out of a server's pocket.   This Yelp Elite won't spend another cent at Zipps.   San Tan across the parking lot is amazing! Be sure to see for yourself.   Tiffany is really f***ing stupid!",

We moved away 2 months ago and came back for lunch and watching the games. Serena, our waitress was lovely but in regards with food, just stop trying. 3 years ago they were consistently great but lately, it's fail after fail.   Drinks and their great specials are hard to mess up, but don't come here hungry. Waist of money and piece of advice- invest the money in another Zipparita :)   Recap: drinks and specials are great, but get food elsewhere. Who serves cold mozzarella sticks and an egg fully cooked on a burger?  You should never charge for extra dressing on something that already come with a meal! We got a total of two ranch for the entire meal- one for mozzarella sticks and other for veggie burger. I can't believe it- on top of all this service and you did nothing to even offer to compensate but charge MORE for something that should be included!!!  We didn't need any money back but why was it impossible to ask us if they could redo our order after hearing it was bad? Ridiculous- you've lost consistent business for 5 years!",

We were not a priority, our 2 orders of wings took 40 minutes, she had a trainee that we heard about after 35 minutes when we reminded her of our wings, only to hear about the trainee at that point. (We noticed on our own, prior.) Additionally, we never received the water we requested 10 minutes into our 90 minute visit. We love Zipp's, but today really was not the best day at all.

Unfortunately, tonight was a huge let down. Although a couple important games were on, we were seated immediately since many tables were available. For a table of 6, we were given 1 menu and no silverware/napkins. We started by ordering drinks and food immediately. Drinks took 15 minutes, which is somewhat understandable due to the the amount of people at the bar. However, food took 55 minutes to come to our table and we were rarely visited by a waitress. We ordered 3 appetizers, 2 slices of pizza, and a burger. Bringing out appetizers after almost an hour is unacceptable. Our checks were not split up after requesting multiple checks and we had to reiterate our orders to the waitress since it was not originally noted what each of us ordered. After speaking with the manager, he explained they were understaffed and offered an apology. We were also given a generous discount on each meal which we were more than thankful for. All in all, we will most likely pick a new spot for sporting events after tonight's experience.",

Now there is a new manager with a \"seating policy.\"  That meant that if you aren't young and hip looking, you are told that they don't have any tables for two.  Same thing happened to the two people checking in right in front of us.  The hostess was very rude to them so I tried to be extra nice so I wouldn't get treated like that.  Didn't help.  The manager was a total jerk about everything.  There were plenty of open tables, but they were \"saving them for more than two people.\"  It was 5:50 pm. That's when a young couple with a baby came in long after us, and they sat them at an empty table right away.   We were told by Cesar Rodriquez, the GM, that they were a \"party of 3\" so they got seated.  We looked around the restaurant, and just about every 4-top table or booth had 2 people at it.    Total BS.  If you are over 55, don't bother going to this Zipp's.  We finally left because the staff was rude and kept smirking at us.  This used to be one of our favorite places, but now we will never go back.",

    "text": "Is this place actually supposed to be . .  . you know. . . . a business?  We showed up at about 7 on a Tuesday, putting us in the no-mans land between happy hours. That part didn't matter much to me, but as we seated ourselves I wondered if we might be catching them in a dead spot. Maybe that explains the rest of the review. I'm not anxious to try again. At any time.  We chose to sit in the bar area where more of the tables were full than in the restaurant area. We were just there for a couple drinks and some apps.  The waitress shows up and my friend asks what they have on tap. The waitress recites a voluminous list from memory, blandly. However, neither of us could hear her well enough over the Brian Adams or some other droning shit they had playing too loudly in the background. My friend asks to see a printed beer list. The waitress--a bit perplexed--explains that they don't have printed beer lists. My friend settles for water and starts searching \"Zipps Phoenix Beers\" on her iPhone. On the other hand,  I--determined to get my drink on--order up a vodka tonic and throw in an order of some wings.  We wait.  I get my drink. The tonic water is flat as a stretch of Nebraska Interstate. Waitress comes back around. I tell her that it's not working for me and since I suspect that their tonic has gone flat, I order a vodka Diet Coke instead. She apologizes and takes the drink away. A few minutes later she's back with the Diet Coke and vodka.   Which is also flat.   And apparently made with \"vodka\" made from straining Sterno through gym socks.   Waitress is now off in the distance carting around dishes. I try to wave her down. No response. I take it to the bar. Bartender not paying attention. I look back to our table. The waitress is back, but empty-handed. My friend is now searching various blog entries from 2007 looking for hints of which beers they offer besides . . . y'know . . . fuckin' Bud Light, which might be all they usually sell.  I decide to have a beer instead, taking the time to walk back to the bar to look at the taps. I order an IPA.  My friend says \"oh, that sounds  . . . ok . . . \". Ok then: Two. Make it two IPA's. The waitress slowly walks off, carting with her the last abortive attempt at a cocktail and our inspired beer order.  We wait.   I look over at the kitchen and was reminded of an order for some wings placed way back . . . oh. . . .a couple of screwed-up drink orders before. Seems like sometime back during the days of Weimar Republic by this point.  I notice that although the bar area is well-occupied, the restaurant area is basically empty. I don't see any orders up on the kitchen window. Servers and the cooks are standing around talking. I look at my friend across the table. We look at the bar, and back at the kitchen. No beers. No wings. The taste of two lousy drinks still on my tongue. A gradually-accumulating wave of bitter resentment rising within me.  We got up and left. The Garage was right across the street and was everything that Zipps wasn't this night.  In a word: A business.",

I do understand if it's really busy, and she is busting her rear end to satisfy everyone. but the thing is she didn't have many tables to attend to. it then took about an hour to get our food (strips and wings) I know that isn't her fault so I'm not blaming her on that.. the food was good, but to top it all off. we waited another twenty minutes for the waitress to pick our tabs up.. so honestly, the service was just very bad...",

Sally caught the snafu promptly and the manager Shelby came and fixed the situation by offering us a free pizza for a future visit. Knives, forks and wet naps were given to us prior to eating which is a plus.  Bar was clean, lighting was dimly low but that is ok because the location was at maybe 7% capacity. Pizza is thin crust, you save $1 by ordering a whole pizza as opposed to a whole pizza by the slice. Enjoy! Bon apatite!",

They were the smallest that we have had there in a long time. If the wings continue to be that small we're going to have to go elsewhere.  I bet if you were to weigh them they would be 33% less. Honestly they should be sold by the pound rather than 10 to an order. Nice way to make more money for Zipps. Talked to a women manager and she gave us some lame excuse about cooking time. And most of all she didn't care a shit about us. But most of all she was disrespectful of her customers.",

If you're going to work customer service please KNOW what it's about. They make it seem like they're doing YOU a favor by even taking your order.   My friends and I came here for dinner and ordered wings/beer. there was a total of 3 orders of wings, they came back & gave us 2. Then the girl acted like it was OUR fault that she only put an order for 2 instead of 3. Came back & told us the kitchen was closing. We asked to speak to a manager & the manager was nicer than our waitress but still nothing they can do other than giving us their apologies.   If you love Zipps visit the Indian school location. They have the best customer service & same prices/menu.   I truly hope they take these reviews into consideration & retrain ALL of their employees.",

At the other zipps we were met very often, here we were rarely tended to. Our waiter screwed up multiple orders, then took a very long time to get our correct orders back to us. After all this, we were improperly charged in about 8 ways including added sides, cheese on regular burgers, and bigger drinks. After all this, we were not apologized to once. I recommend never coming to this location, and if this was our first time at a Zipps we wouldn't go to the other zipps either, but luckily we had a great experience and look forward to going to a different location in the future.",

Yeah it's a sports bar and I shouldn't have expected much. But sports bars all over the valley are upping their game! Zipps really needs to keep up. Everything is served in baskets. Are we still in the 80s? I never understood why that was a trend. I get it if you're ordering discounted happy hour food. For a regular $10 to $12 sandwich though, give me a plate please! I had the chicken burrito which was very tasty, although it was stuck under a heat lamp for a while because the tortilla was a bit crunchy. I was uber disappointed with the chocolate brownie sundae. Super bland and drizzled with caramel sauce, not chocolate sauce. Bad flavor combo!  Score is a 3.5ish out of 5, although I rounded up because service is never an issue.",

Unfortunately it turned into a great night gone bad. We were there over 5 hours enjoying ourselves....the food and drinks were great. Then we went to pay our bills. This is where everything went down hill quickly. They don't keep track of who gets what. One of our friends had ordered 2 Zipparitas at the bar and 1 at our table. He paid for the 2 at the bar beforehand. At the end of the night they tried charging him for 2 at the table. He only ordered 1 at the table. This was a $4 Zipparita mind you. Instead of just saying \"I'm sorry I got it wrong\" and taking it off they proceeded to argue and THEN called the cops on us for a $4 drink. We could've easily paid the $4 and left but it was the principle of being charged for a drink we didn't order. One of our other teachers ended up giving them a $5 bill to cover the charge but they still wouldn't bring us the bill until the cops showed up. Apparently the cops get called to this location all the time over stupid issues like this. It's one thing if a fight broke out or if we all didn't pay our bills but it was over a $4 drink. I would much rather have our police going after the more serious crimes than over a $4 drink. But that's ZIPPS for ya. You know we happy hour quite regularly and go back frequently to the places we like. Unfortunately for Zipps they lost out on a lot of future business because of a $4 drink and poor customer service.",

I can't tell you how upset this situation made me feel.  So we walked in and sat down in the BAR area. I requested to have one of the TVs changed to the UFC fight that was already playing on a different TV but we could not see very well to start with. So as the waitress walks away she comes back with who I assume was the manager I am not sure because he didn't even approach us directly or even speak straight to us but he sure did speak loud enough for us to hear. He said \"we don't show the UFC fights, in fact I'm going to change that channel right now\" I was appalled! I couldn't believe that he just said that. Luckily we hadn't even ordered anything yet so we got up and walked out (I was actually looking forward on trying their wings)   Unbelievable! Your name has SPORTS in it! So Zipps doesn't consider UFC a sport?! Honestly I felt like I was being discriminated. What if we would have found a table near the TV that was already showing the fight. Would he have came over and it switched it to something else while we were watching it?  Think about it.",

I can honestly say that in 40 years of eating in the valley I have never had worse food than this.  I'm getting sick just typing this.",

After placing our order, we waited 30 minutes and our food had still not arrived. We flagged down our server and asked if food was coming. He let us know we were next and it should be right out. After a couple minutes, he returns and tells us he never entered in our order.   At that point we walked out and drove through the Taco Bell drive through. Not at all a good substitute but after waiting all that time, we were not about to wait even more.   It will be a long time before I return.",

I go back because I love their wings and fries. I recommend golden hot wings they're spicy but so delicious. However, they have got to have the worst service ever. After delivering your food, you will not see the server again and have to literally hunt them down to get your check. Oh and good luck if you don't like your food because they won't even check in with you in that regard. Managers suck as well. Also, don't order for pick up since they have a tendency to give orders to incorrect people which has happened to me on two occasions. I was very upset and the manager had absolutely nothing to say and didn't even apologize. He did absolutely nothing (and I was on my lunch break) with that being said I didn't eat all day that day thanks to their lack of absolutely everything possible.",

Having difficulty finding food after bowling last Friday we popped by the Bethany Home location minutes before midnight but as others have complained it took about 15 minutes to get noticed.  We finally did place our food order and the girls two wines...oops here's your wine but the kitchens closed.  WHAT?  Why'd you take our order and why would we stay for wine when last resort tasty Taco Bell next door?  Sorry, you pay!  Ummm, really...let's fix this with a manager.  Ryan demands we pay regardless to commonsense nor good business practice for a measly $12.49!  He offered up a $5 coupon that expired the next day.  The girls scoffed and ripped it up and no sooner awesome Ryan asked us to pay, leave or he'd call the cops.  We waited for the girls to finish and than the poor police came to deal with this silly situation... of which the police rolled their eyes that Zipps wasted their time to even call them. We won't be back!",

We sat down and we waited and waited and waited until we had to grab a server ourself to give us a menu. Once we had the menu the server disappeared and we once again had to ask him if we could place our order. I too am a server and know the demands of customers can get overwhelming but when me and my boyfriend initially came in and sat down there was only one other table sitting. I asked for water and never got it. They brought my food out and not my boyfriends until ONCE AGAIN we had to ask for it. Not once did the server introduce himself, ask us if we need anything, or checked on us. I love zipps but I will NEVER come back to this location and I will make sure everyone I know knows about the experience I had. Terrible customer service and the food was mediocre.",

Try a mix of both for a different kick.  The other menu items are tasty and high-quality also.  In particular their fried cheese sticks in wonton wrappers are simply awesome and worth a try.  Of course, being a sports-type place, avoid the game times unless you like noisy crowds.  Otherwise the place has a decent noise level and the service is fast and efficient.",

She didn't come back for another 10 minutes or so. We were one of five tables at lunch time. We ordered an appetizer -- $8 for five mozzarella sticks? WTF!! I could make better mozzarella sticks at home for cheaper. Our burgers were decent, and the fries and sweet potato chips were good. However, the waitress never came back to check on us. When we paid in cash, she asked if we wanted our change back. I told her yes, we did. She came back without the change and said \"did you still want your change?\" I told her yes, nothing had changed in the two minutes she was gone. She came back with the change, and we signed the receipts, left the tip, etc. We were still visiting when she came and picked up her tip (rather rude to do so before the customers leave in my opinion), and proceeded to stare at us from behind the counter near the kitchen until we left. We used to frequent Zipps all the time to watch games or for a late night meal after leaving a game. We will not be back because of the prices and terrible service. The only reason this review isn't getting one star (or zero if that was an option) is because the food was edible. Zipps needs to rethink their menu and customer service since other reviews mention the same flaws.",

    "text": "My family and I have eaten at Zipps many times.  Today my husband and I went in at 11:15am. We were the 1st customers in.  We ordered 2 Bloody Mary's, 1 with extra olives, an order of wings, 1 house salad and a club sandwich.  Our Bloody Mary's were soooo bad. About the most generic I've ever had.  I was also told by my server that she had been told by the manager at the bar that I could not have extra olives as they were expensive and I would be charged $.75 for every 3 olives in my Bloody Mary.  About 20 minutes later my husband's house salad came. 10 minutes after that my sandwich came....then we stared at our food for another 20 minutes until the wings came out.  Our server was great. Very professional and sweet.  Unfortunately, the kitchen and bar were not making life easy for the servers. So...I'd say don't EVER get a Bloody Mary from Zipps unless you BYOO (bring your own olives.) And don't expect to get your food in a timely manner or to get your orders together. Zipp's....the food was pretty good. But the experience was long and drawn out.  And I've never ever EVER been charged for olives.  I've actually many times had a bar tender send us an entire glass of olives.  Ridiculous!!",
