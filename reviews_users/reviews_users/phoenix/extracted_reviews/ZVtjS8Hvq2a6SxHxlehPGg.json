We started with the grilled vegetable platter which had asparagus, broccoli, cauliflower, red peppers, artichoke, mushrooms, caprese, kalamata olives, and tomato bruschetta. Amazing flavors. My husband had the halibut special which melted in his mouth. I had the cioppini spicy style which was top notch. We ended by sharing the tiramisu which a perfect ending to the meal. Definitely going back!",

This quaint find was delightful and as we walked away, the words came out of our mouths, \"that is the way to run a restaurant\"!  The food: Each of us had a something different;  Gnocchi made with pesto (they don't have it on the menu but the owner asked the staff if they could make it fresh.)   Ravioli with sweet Italian sausage and steak.  All were cooked to flavor and perfectly.    Even the wine was unique... \"If you see Kate\"...   What a wonderful place with a great, take care of the customer attitude.  I will be back and I don't live in Phoenix.",

    "text": "A friend assured me this was \"life-changing pasta\" - well, I don't know if my life has CHANGED so much, but it is certainly richer for knowing about this hidden gem.  We split two different pasta dishes (the tortellini and the baked ziti) and two salads and a cannoli, and the experience was top-notch at every level.  The food is simple in terms of recipes, flavor profiles, etc., but simply exquisitely executed.  Service is a tad slow compared to other places but this is clearly not a \"turn the tables\" sort of operation - enjoy the time and atmosphere.  We didn't have a reservation so we were in the bar area near a very talented musician who delicately played well-known songs just below the level of conversation (as well as a couple of \"Happy birthdays\" for two people having their special day).  The owners checked in with our table several different times.  This is a place that is well-run with tremendous love and care.  It's a tad on the pricey compared to some other places - just a tad - but still a bargain, as I'd expect to pay twice as much in LA or NY and be just as satisfied.  Go!  Enjoy!",

So I will just say, it was the most delicious food ever! The mushroom soup was.exquisite. The lemon butter caper grouper was out of this world, and I didnt order the cioppino but i have never seen something so amazing. Chuck full of seefood. My friend LOVED IT! I am really impressed. The service was great by the way. It felt like they were expecting me and i was a vip. Warmly greeted by the owner himself, and what it felt like the wholeteam of waiters, i could not complain.",

The food was incredible - and then the prices were 30% less than I would expect for that quality of food. Seriously - this place will never fall off the radar again.  We had two specials that night: Short Ribs with Canneloni (maybe the best canneloni I have ever had) and the Red Snapper in a lemon piccata with a side of linguine.  Perfection!  And not to mention the part about rarely finding good, fresh red snapper in the desert...  That is one of my favorite fish.  So glad it was on special!",

There were stools but they were singles on the opposite sides of the bar. As we were standing there, the host approached us and asked if we were here for dinner.  We said no, just drinks and would only be there for about 15 or 20 minutes. As he surveyed the bar, he said why don't you take this table which was in the bar area.  We sat down and the server came over to take our order.  We explained to him that we were only going to be here for a very short time and we were just going to order drinks. As we discussed which wine to order, a man (who we later learned is the owner Greg) approached us from behind and was screaming, NO NO NO! You may not sit here. This is RESERVED.  At this point the host came back over and explained that he and seated us there and that we were only going to be there for a very short time, clearly indicating that we would be gone before the reservation. The man proceeded to say, ABSOLUTELY NOT! and gestured for us to leave this table immediately.  He made no attempt to offer us another location to have drinks and was less than professional.  We got up and left the restaurant.  We did not ask for this table!  We followed the lead of the host who offered it to us. Obviously they did not want our business last night. We spent our money elsewhere. We will never return, and we will tell as many people about this experience as possible.",

I had fresh grouper picatta also fantastic served with sauteed fresh spinach and linguine nearly $30.  Cesar (a la carte) delicious but did not have anchovies. We don't drink but the bill was up there.  The service there is outstanding.  Waitress extremely attentive.  We sat outside and you had a peek of the mountain.  Inside appeared upscale (bordering on stuffy) to me.  Bottom line highly recommended for the superior food but be prepared for moderately high prices.",

I felt like we were celebrating at a friend's house. The musician sang Happy Birthday to me when they brought out dessert and everyone in the bar sang to me :-)   Even better than the hospitality is the food. I had the cheese ravioli which is homemade and unbelievable, super light and delicious. My husband had the chicken piccata which had a great lemony flavor with sides of pasta, broccoli and carrots. The service was impeccable , attentive but not overbearing. Wish we lived in Phoenix so we could stop in every week for dinner!",

It hit on all cylinders; great food, great service, solid ambiance on the patio (you don't even know you're near the parking lot).  We had the tortellini and baked ziti; you could taste the homemade love. No Italian restaurant worth its salt fails on the bread, and L'Amore delivered, crunchy crust, warm and soft inside.  Do yourself a favor, stop here when in the Phoenix area!",

    "text": "Had reservations for 2 at 6 pm on a Friday evening.  We were greeted by both owners and seated immediately. We were one of maybe 8-10 tables. Within 15 minutes the restaurant was full and bustling. Atmosphere is white table cloth classy but not pretentious. Took Yelp advice and ordered the Cioppino from the specials offered.  For about $35 I enjoyed a huge oval dish of rich tomato broth chock full of exquisitely cooked mussels, clams, scallops, shrimp and fish - all over linguine and with plenty of bread to soak up the broth. The calamari was too tough to eat , the linguine was over cooked, and the dish was tomato paste heavy. I did not care because on balance, the dish was deliciously phenomenal. Took home enough for two other meals.   Companion had the special of beef short rib and cannelloni. My goodness. It was heaven on a plate. The short rib was not fatty but was melt in your mouth tender with a slight sweet and smoky flavor - about $25. The cannelloni was a bit salty but delicious. Again, we had food to take home.  Soup/salad course was unremarkable which in hindsight is curious given the attention to the rest of the dining experience.   Service was very attentive even if not especially friendly.   We found it noteworthy that at least a dozen parties were greeted like old friends by the owners (who never stop moving and attending to guests during service).  Music was mostly standards, pleasant, and at a volume that comfortably allowed conversation. This is clearly a neighborhood favorite.  Will be our new go-to Italian restaurant.   Don't be fooled by the outside while driving past on 32nd or Lincoln. The curb appeal is apparent only while up close in the parking lot.  Total bill including tip but without wine/cocktails was less than $80.  A very fair price for the quality and service provided.",

    "text": "The husband and I went to L'Amore for our last anniversary. I made the reservation mentioning it was our anniversary. When we arrived, the restaurant was mostly empty and we opted to sit in the bar area because it was still happy hour. Their hh selection of drinks is....Let's say, limited. Obviously this place is not a bar, so I wasn't expecting a large specialty cocktail list or anything, but this place did not have a cocktail list at all, making ordering a drink that was included in hh difficult. For example, I asked about an amaretto sour, and the waiter checked only to find out they don't have a well amaretto....We kinda went back and forth like this (you know, basic ish drinks like a sidecar...) Until I finally settled for sangria (which was clearly poured straight from a bottle and not mixed with fruit or juice or anything to make it much more than crappy red wine).   To start, the husband and I shared the mussels. This was the weirdest thing....The mussels were fine, a little on the fishy side (unlike at say little Cleo's or other 'nice' restaurants), but they came with no bread..... They were literally in a bowl full of tasty garlic, white wine, and butter sauce and you have to pay extra for bread! I was very surprised. For dinner, I had lasagna and the husband had gnocchi. They came with soup or salad. For the price, none of it was all that great. I've had equally good or better lasagna for less than half the price at other local establishments. The portions were not huge, but certainly large enough. We ended up taking some food home (and they even packed up my leftover mussel sauce which I did appreciate).   Here's where the really annoying part comes in. This restaurant never acknowledged our anniversary despite my having special noted it on the reservation. They didn't even say 'happy anniversary' let alone offer a dessert or anything to make the night special, and we spent about 100$ on dinner (which is insane given the quality we received). Although the food wasn't bad, I don't think I would return here and definitely not for a special occasion.",

Wow, I sure was glad to have gotten these dishes. Both were delightful and were wonderful! I couldn't even finish the cioppino because it was massive! Let me tell you, it's even better the next day  for leftovers!  Oh almost forgot.... the bread.... oh goodness the bread. It was warm, chewy and fluffy. If I could just have eaten a loaf by myself.

    "text": "It was a Friday afternoon, my boyfriend at the time said, \"Hey let's go out later for a nice dinner.  Some place we've never been.  Check Yelp and let me know'.  That's exactly what I did.  I searched, \"Date night restaurants near me\".  I'm located in Central Phoenix, walking distance to the Biltmore area.  L'Amore was the first restaurant to pop up!  I noticed they accept reservations online via Open Table ... Points People!  I booked it with ease.  Our reservation was for 7pm.  The minute we arrived the kind hostess called me by my name (score) and led us menus in hand to our very intimate table.  It was a Friday night, there was a large birthday party of about 12 people and a pretty crowded restaurant, yet, at no time did we feel neglected or uncomfortable.  The server was amazing.  The manager (owner maybe) came out to inquire about our meals and overall evening and invited us back again.  It was such a nice evening.  I do plan to return again with my new boyfriend.  *Smile*   We ordered the Baby Greens Salad to start.  It's simple but delicious with only spinach, roasted red peppers, herb feta and balsamic vinaigrette.  The herb feta was a really nice addition to the salad.  Next time I visit I'm going to try the Seafood Wedge.  We also shared an order of Calamari to start.  L'Amore serves both fried and sauteed calamari.  I've never had sauteed calamari so I stuck with the usual, fried Calamari with black garlic, red pepper and a pepperoni puree.  Again ... Delicious!  Usually my mate and I would share an entree if we get an appetizer but because the appetizers were so good and it was date night I convinced him to get his own meal.   I ordered Chicken Marsala with vegetables.  He ordered the grilled salmon with vegetables.  I thoroughly enjoyed both dishes but the Chicken Marsala ... I thought about that dish days later so maybe that was my favorite.  It was cooked perfectly.  It was moist, seasoned so well, and needed nothing at all.  After sharing a bottle of wine, a salad and an appetizer, and our own entrees, we were happy and full so we didn't get dessert.",

After we were seated we weren't given menus for another ten minutes. Our waiter was great, but the amount of items that they had run out of by the time we were ordering was huge. We ended up ordering the cioppino and we asked for more bread and of course they were out of bread.

Our waiter looked familiar...he worked at a place 20 years ago that was the type of place I have been trying to find since they closed. What a great reunion. The food was EXCELLENT, service GREAT, The people who work there are Friendly and nice.      What more could you want?",

Cioppino was undeniably the best I've had since leaving New York. The Calamari was perfectly crispy and my husband absolutely enjoyed his linguini in red clam sauce. The evening was made Even more memorable to us by the live band on the premises serenading patrons with classics. Great evening! Thank you Kim and Greg! It would be a sin to be a resident of Phoenix and not have visited this beautiful restaurant! Will definitely be back when in town.",

    "text": "Found this place through Yelp and the reviews convinced me that it was worth a visit.  Decided to go for lunch when it would be less crowded and the prices would be lower (in case we hated it and didn't want to cry over a huge bill).   About 1ish and there were a few tables with a number of people.  Good sign, I thought.  The place is LOVELY. It is nicely decorated with an \"old school\" italian feel and wonderful piped in music (I thought I heard some Sinatra) .    We ordered chicken parmigiana and chicken marsala---italian standards so that we could compare these dishes to other places where we have eaten.  We were brought some warm, crusty bread and softened butter in a ramekin.  I like butter that doesn't come in those tiny disposable mini containers other places serve up.   The bread, while attractive and crusty, was not a bread one would call delicious. It was just bread.  Do you get what I mean?  I give them credit for giving free bread which many italian restaurant now charge for.   The Chicken Parmigiana was an adequate portion for lunch as was the chicken marsala.  Both came with rigatoni (or ziti not sure) and the marsala dish came with veggies.  The marsala sauce had mushrooms in it and was not overly sweet.  That is my preference, but the person who ordered it, thought it to be a tad salty and not as sweet as it usually is.  After all, he said, \"Marsala wine does have a sweetness to it.\"  The chicken in both dishes was prepared well--not overcooked.   The rigatoni were cooked perfectly \"al dente\"  the way pasta is supposed to be cooked.  The disappointment was the red sauce--the marinara sauce--And to us, the sauce is EVERYTHING!  It was too thick perhaps from using too much tomato paste and very oregano-y.  Too much oregano in fact.  Spices have to be used subtly so that no one herb or spice dominates to the point where the diner can call out what it is.  It is to be a melange of flavors married to each other and complementing one another.  So the sauce was not a winner for us.  Being originally from NY, we have had the best of the best  and have eaten sauces that blow your mind with deliciousness.   The dishes were $14 each, but if this had been dinner, they would have been $23.  So I'm glad we conducted this experiment at lunchtime.   I really liked the decor and the hospitality as one of the owners came by the table to greet us when we first sat down.  However, there was no goodbye.  Perhaps our assessment of the food was written in our faces.",

The owners, Greg and Kim never forget a face and you feel like family by your second visit.  No rushing, no menus at 1st...they encourage you to relax and take your time.  Not sure I have ever actually read the menu as we always default to the Specials.  I end up with either the Bouillabaisse (to die for) Sea Bass or Halibut Piccata. Seafood Salad is a great way to start things off.  Seafood is always amazing here, incredibly fresh and perfectly cooked.  My husband loves the pasta dishes and always orders a meatball (on the side) as they are the best in town.  Save room for the mini cannolis, best I have ever had.  A nice bonus is Rombauer  Chardonnay by the bottle at a great price! Comfort at it's best!",

Menu Special: off-the-bone  beef short ribs with a side of sauteed spinach and stuffed cannelloni. The short ribs were fork-tender, moist and perfectly seasoned. The cannelloni was simply amazing too.  Off the menu: Lasagna. Classic. Perfection!! I got full toward the end of it, but kept pushing like the little engine who could.   New York style cheesecake and Cappuccino for dessert. Perfect finish to a ferfect meal!   Sat at the bar for dinner and the service from Laura was awesome.

Salmon was cooked slightly too much for this med-rare salmon-lover, but was scrumptious just the same.

    "text": "Found this place in the corner of a strip mall while vacationing in Scottsdale.  It's a smallish place but very popular with the locals.  We had a reservation but due to a large party that came in before us we had to wait about 20 min, but it was ok as we had a glass of wine at the bar.  The owner seated us and was very friendly.  I ordered cannelloni and short ribs, but they were out of the ribs.  So the server offered to make up a special plate with cannelloni and linguine bolognese.  It was a good recommendation and all of their pasta dishes were outstanding.  Fresh and perfectly al dente, with flavorful sauces.  Fresh hot bread was amazing too.    Only drawback to the service was they served our bottle of Pinot Noir at refrigerator temp which was far too cool.  I could have requested a cellar temp bottle but i didn't want it to be room temp, and I figured it would warm up as we enjoyed a long slow dining experience.  It did and we had a wonderful evening.    I would definitely return on my next visit to the area.",

    "text": "Quick review: Nice staff, EXPENSIVE FOOD, HORRIBLE QUALITY OF THE FOOD, definitely wouldn't recommend this place to anyone a meal for two and an appetizer cost me $83 in total plus tip.   I have never actually given a review of a restaurant before this one, but I genuinely felt like I had to warn people about eating here. For starters the ambiance was very nice! They had live music and I love when restaurants do that. The staff was also amazing! I felt as if the owner or manager was a little too involved with his customers and was in need of some professional restraint, but to each their own on that one. I am leaving this review because of the HORRIBLE food to price ratio. What exactly do I mean by that? Well the food quality WAS NOT AT ALL WHAT I PAID FOR. It genuinely was sub-par food and ingredients that I could have ran to frys and gotten. I knew it was bad when I got a side of \"steamed\" vegetables and it was nothing more than a few carrots and a very large piece of cauliflower. The chicken was not butterflied or tenderized properly. The only thing that struck me as genuinely good was the red bell pepper sauce under the strait from the freezer calamari. My pasta was WAY undercooked and my girlfriends gnocchi was WAY overdone tasting more like mush than anything else. For god sakes they didn't even grate fresh Parmesan over your food it was already ready to go(Cardinal sin in any Italian restaurant), and they cut THICK LONG slices of Parmesan over your food that didn't melt and took away all of the experience from the box made under cooked pasta. All of this wouldn't be enough for me to leave a review if my meal in total for two people was $73?!?! Plus a tip of $10 (probably should have tipped more like I usually do but I was already pissed I had to leave $73 to this awful meal). In total came out to $73??! How can food of this horrid quality be considered worth ANYWHERE NEAR THAT?? This place caters the old rich people of Scottsdale who don't really seem to mind the dates decor, or the seemingly endless pictures of horses on the walls, or the chandelier that looked like it was ready to pop off at any moment. I really wanted to like this place because of the staff but I can't justify ever coming here again due to the horrible quality of the food and how ungodly expensive it is. I didn't take pictures of the food but I'll leave my bill as evidence that I did ACTUALLY eat here.  UPDATE: I found Kim's response pretty unprofessional to say the least! (Photo included)",

    "text": "It was Saturday February 17th 2018 and I made a reservation for two at approximately 8pm & told them it was a VERY special occasion and requested a table for two.  I had planned to propose to my girlfriend. We arrived to the most beautiful ambiance, the restaurant was completely full, greeted at the entrance with a very warm welcome by the older female hostess.  My girlfriend was so excited about the ambiance & music, it was quite stimulating. She seated us within minutes and we requested to sample their very best Chardonnay. After tasting two,  I then ordered a bottle of my girlfriend's choosing.  After reviewing the menu, we decided on the Caprese Salad to start & to be followed by a Veal Piccata and Veal Marsala.  Unfortunately when the Caprese Salad arrived, there was NO BASIL but rather plenty of spinach!?!  As we pushed our plates away with disappointment the server noticed and reported to the kitchen, then suddenly returned to confirm that they were out of Basil. Shortly after that awful experience, our entrees arrived while still maintaining hope, but yet again disappointed after a few bites, realizing the veal for both dishes was tough and must have been frozen for quite some time. My girlfriend thought it was chicken! Personally I wasn't sure what kind of meat I had just tasted. Once again we pushed our plates away and immediately requested the check.  At that point the owner came over, introduced himself and sat down at our table; uninvited. We expressed our initial disappointment with the Basil-less Caprese salad (if any Italian could call it that).  He apologized and informed us that due to so many clients, the kitchen had ran out of ingredients and it had been removed off our bill. To which we wondered why it had been knowingly served in the first place with a key ingredient missing.  We quickly made our escape back to our regular Italian joint just down the road. Never to return to this so called Italian restaurant.   P.S. My girlfriend said 'yes' after she ate REAL Italian food at Veneto.",

After being seated the service was great.  We ordered the special which was short ribs and cannelloni.  Unfortunately there is only one choice of salad dressing which is oil and way, way too much vinegar.  Even my partner who likes vinaigrette could not eat it.  The bread served was warm and scrumptious.  The main course was served with a sauteed spinach and tomato which also had way, way too much vinegar. The short ribs were cooked to death, as they should be, and the sauce was great.  The cannelloni was excellent.  If L'Amore could only figure out their salad dressing and maybe offer another option like feta cheese it would really improve  the dining experience.  Especially considering we spent almost $100 on dinner with no desert and only 2 glasses of wine and 1 beer.   But it has been this way for years and so I guess it will always stay this way.   If they would improve the salad and the sauteed vegetables I could improve my rating.",

I only had pasta, so I can't speak for the entrees, but a dish of pasta was closer to $20 a plate than $12.  The crowd was older.  We were the youngest people by at least 20 years.  However, if you ask me, it's a sign of how GOOD the food was (older people tend to have more $$ to spend on their meals, and thus choose better ones!!!)  Finally, it's a little far out of the way, but that's only because I live in downtown Phoenix; this may not be an issue for you!  That's all I got for cons!  :)  Pros:  The food was AMAZING!!!!  The portions are definitely large, and in all, are totally worth what they cost.  We tried the potato gnocchi with red sauce, the chicken fettucini alfredo, and the tortellini with prosciutto and peas and cream sauce.  I would HIGHLY recommend the tortellini, it's CRAZY how amazing it was!!!  The staff was nice, there was even some live music!  The setting is very romantic, but not too over the top (we went as a girls night, and even then it was still fun!)   Overall, it's totally worth the drive, and worth the prices if you are up for sharing (or it's a special occasion!)  Loved it!",

Full disclosure:  we tried four times, each time it was around 8:00 pm. Two of the four we were treated pretty poorly by a female hostess. There were still patrons eating in the restaurant, but she told us they were getting the main dining room set up for a big event the next day (both times) and sat us in the bar. Last night, there was a basketball game on in the bar...I would not mind eating in a pub atmosphere if we were paying pub prices. So, when we told her that the noise was too much and asked to be reseated in the restaurant she refused. I don't think was too much to ask, for just the two of us. And it's interesting the other two times we went, the male hosts gave us the choice, and sat us in the restaurant.  Food has been inconsistent, but not all that bad.  Pasta on two visits was all small pieces (spaghetti one night and fettuccine another) like we were getting the dregs. I'd be more tolerant of that, but for the price of the food, we expect a more pleasant dining experience.   Too bad.  They need to make some changes.",

The meat dishes and seafood are amazing.   The fish is fresh and wild caught.  In particular, the shrimp and scallops are the jumbo kind, not the cheap stuff,  which the owner also special orders.          When eating here you feel as if you should not be able to get such quality fresh food in Phoenix, particularly the seafood dishes.  The sauces are the best I have had, the red sauce is orgasmic.  Plates are artfully constructed and beautiful as they are yummy.  Prices are not cheap, but you get what you pay for, and on that note the value is quite apparent here as they do not skimp on anything here to save money.  Portions here are big.  You really feel you are getting great value with the amazing food they serve here.  Raviolis are so thin and delicate. Yum.          Great wine, great atmosphere, great service.  If you are looking for VERY authentic Italian food in a charming and romantic setting, this place truly can not be beat.  Check them out, you won't be disappointed.",

Started off with the calimarie and when it came out, there was almost no sauce with it. The salad was fine but too much dressing. I had the chicken piccatta and it was very oily and the sides were penne pasta with tomato sauce and some steamed carrots and broccoli. My wife had the halibut piccatta special that was very salty. Not really worth the money and the atmosphere was a senior citizen crowd.",

If you're planning to use a <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate, please read this first.  If you're planning to try to combine anything from happy hour with regular dinner prices, read this first.  Having said that . . .  I've been here a couple of times.  The service is hit or miss.  I will note that it seemed to impress the waiter when we were able to order without looking at the menu.  He became a little more attentive after that.  The big issue?  Well, it shouldn't have been an issue at all.  How many of you have ever used <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> to try out a new place?  If you haven't, you may be missing out.  Or so I thought, until tonight.  I love <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> because it gets me to try new places that I might never happen upon.  Let me say, here, that we eat out way too much and spend an embarrassing amount on restaurant food and drink.  But occasionally, I pull the \"coupon card\" and get my husband to try some place out of his comfort zone.  This was one of those occasions.  My general rule is that when I find a place on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> that I think has potential, I try it out twice with a certificate.  If I really like it, I'll become a regular customer -- sans the coupon.  As much as we eat out, there are not enough coupons in the world to handle that.  Such was the case.  Now, here's the kicker.  We went during happy hour time.  Yes, I know <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> excludes happy hour prices for most restaurants.  I'm good with that.  I get it -- no one wants to offer a discounted discount.  And that's fair.  The problem stems here, though, when you try to combine your check for happy hour and regular dinner prices.  For two people, our check was over $100.  No, this was not a special occasion.  This is just dinner for two in the Phoenix metro.  Let me clarify by saying, I've done this before.  You order a few happy hour appetizers to see how they are, then you order dinner at regular price with the benefit of the gift certificate.  That seems simple enough, right?  Wrong.  When the check came, we looked it over and made sure we had reached the minimum $50 purchase (regular prices, that is) for the $25 dollar cert.  My risotto was $30, his shrimp parm was about $27.  That's plenty, right?  Wrong, according to the owner.  In the owner's view, if you order ANYTHING off the happy hour menu that's the same check as regular dinner, your coupon is not valid.  Huh?  We \"discussed\" this, the owner and I, for a good 15 minutes.  He kept telling me that the cert is not good for happy hour.  Yes, I get that!  We ordered 4 happy hour apps and 4 glasses of happy hour wine.  $5 each.  That's fine.  We also spent $60 on regular dinner.  I still don't see the foundation for his argument.    He kept saying that people would \"nickel and dime him\" if he let the happy hour thing go.  Yes, I understand . . . if I'd come in and ordered 10 apps at the $5 happy hour price, then absolutely the coupon is not valid on that.  But we had more than enough in regular dinner cost to meet the certificate requirements.  Well, wow.  He didn't get that.  Apparently, if we'd closed out our bar tab and THEN ordered dinner on a separate check, we'd have been fine.  Again, huh?  Because we ordered everything on one check, it was a huge fiasco!  If we'd known in advance, we'd have just moved tables from the bar into the dining room, with separate checks.  Because, it was WAY too much trouble to just close out our bar tab after the fact, then ring up the dinner tab separately to make sure we met the minimum $50 purchase.  If you've read this far, you're probably smacking your own head.  Here's another kicker:  We got the original check, and we put the check card and the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> certificate in there.  When the check went away, the price of the wine per glass was $5.  When the check came back, it was $6 per glass.  They somehow just couldn't do the correct price with the certificate.  And, no, I didn't get my price per glass back.  The owner actually told me that we were lucky they didn't bill us for their regular app prices rather than the happy hour prices.  He was a piece of work, and I do NOT mean that as a compliment.  If you've made it this far, then here you go . . . the decency of the food is WAY overtaken by the quality of the service and the sudden price fluctuations dictated by the ownership.  There are much better places to have a good dinner out.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here this past weekend with high hopes considering the great response on yelp.  However, it was one disappointment after another.  We were seated right away - by a woman wearing jeans and flip-flops.  Classy.  And we sat there for 40 minutes before we were noticed.  We would have left, but we were thinking it was one of those places that doesn't give you a menu right away on purpose, and we were going to leave at 45 minutes, so they barely saved us in time.  I'm not sure if it was the owner or the manager who came over to greet us, but he didn't even apologize for the crap service when we told him we hadn't been helped yet. The waiter came over next, who did apologize, saying he thought we had already been helped.  Though we appreciate the apology and that at least someone in this establishment cares about our happiness, we couldn't help but wonder why he \"thought someone else had helped\" us in the first place - don't they have designated serving areas?   Even after 15 or 20 minutes, wouldn't the server start to think it's odd we still didn't have drinks, let alone menus?  Shortly thereafter, this woman (owner? co-owner? manager?) came by to apologize to us, which is more than the first owner/manager did for us.  However, her apology was very empty, and you could tell she felt awkward apologizing and didn't know quite what to say.  What she did say was \"this never happens to us\".  Well that's nice, but it just did happen so how about you make up for it somehow.  Furthermore, she placed her hand on the back of my chair as she stood there, her other hand directly on my boyfriend's back.  Please, lady, you don't know us from a hole in the wall, please no touching!  Moving on.  My boyfriend ordered the chicken parmigiana, and I ordered the beef tenderloin gorgonzola.  The starter salad was uneventful; they came it had a house Italian dressing, but it tasted mostly like oil, very bland.  Our main entrees were decent at best.  The beef came with far too much mashed potatoes, and about 5 pieces of crumbled gorgonzola.  There was way more meat than there was cheese, and though gorgonzola can be an overpowering cheese, I expected a bit more.  The chicken tasted good and my boyfriend didn't complain much, other than the fact that his grandmother could make better Italian food than this.  He was looking forward to some authentic Italian food, and this place did not deliver.  In the end, we declined dessert.  And to top it all off, we didn't get comped anything!  Considering the poor service we were given in the beginning, we thought that would be the least they could do for us.  An 8 o'clock reservation turned into a 2-hour meal because we had to wait for the first 40 minutes to be noticed.  Maybe some people like to relax and enjoy dinner for 2 hours, I most certainly do not though.  I would advise others to stay away from this poor establishment and spend your money on more exciting food elsewhere!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I went here for dinner last Friday and was really disappointed in the service! We are new in town from San Francisco, and I wanted to try a restaurant that was on <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FRestaurant.com&s=0aab4cbd731f3d3b0d1453050d3abc56a8c80bd214e25469c7555b750dca8a51\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Restaurant.com</a> since I had some credit with them that I wanted to use up.   First off, it states on the certificate that we needed to present the coupon before being seated...I mean, what does it matter since they were willing to participate in <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> program, and people have already paid for these certs...why would it matter? In any event, we did and ordered. We had the bruschetta, I had linguine with clams, and my BF had the fillet mignon. My linguine came out with some clams on the shell, but it looked like they also dumped a can of clams in there as well to add clam quantity. I haven't seen that before. As for the fillet, it was overcooked.  When the bill came out, I wanted to pay for it using a $20 Open Table check that I had along with our credit card payment (you know how you can get cash for dining so many times using the open table reservations system). The owner guy comes back out and told us we can't use the open table check plus the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> offer to pay for dinner, even though they are part of both programs. I said okay, that's fine, but then he started telling us he can only honor the open table check and not the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> cert! That made no sense to me whatsoever. I could only use the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurant.com&s=c5fe485af4df376130bee54f875814d79c4d7913e1258123b1206d2bdbf4873b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurant.com</a> cert at his restaurant, and could use the open table check anywhere so why would I want him to do that? We argued and he said he can't reverse the transaction, and I was so mad I said we weren't going to use the open table check regardless, whether he honors the restaurant cert or not. He then brought out the entire bill undiscounted with either! We just thought it was the worst dining experience ever, so just paid for the full amount, tipped the waitress her 20 percent since it wasn't her fault, and walked out leaving the paid for but unused cert behind since it's obvious we were never coming back there to dine again! Seriously, I've lived in SF for 20 years, and have never had such a bad dining experience.   Sorry for the lengthy review, but just wanted to share the very disappointing experience we had at this restaurant.",

    "text": "This was our anniversary, a special night.  We choose L'Amore partially for \"the Love\" we were celebrating.    Before we went my husband said he didn't want to use the coupon because he told me that coupons are never what they seem to be and owners don't give people with coupons the same courtesy.  He was right.    The food was wonderful!  Here is the problem.  We w ere the first guests in the dining room and with our reservations made the day before. We were seated at a table in an opening next to an area reserved for a company party that began with an hour of cocktails. Not very private or romantic. It was kind of like sitting next to the kitchen door in a restaurant.   As the private party progressed we could barely hear ourselves talk.  We mentioned this to our waitress, asked for a different table but was told the other tables were reserved \"for regulars.\"  She was nice, polite and apologetic.   Before ordering, when we gave the waitress our coupon, she explained that the coupon was not valid for the specials and neither did the drinks count towards the $50.00 we must spend to use the coupon.  That made sense.  But we were ordering during happy hour and assumed we would be getting happy hour drink prices even though they would not count against the $50.00 minimum.  This was not the case.   The owner  was less than kind.   He was close to rude.  His attitude towards us using the coupon was insulting.  He never made any attempt throughout the evening to come to our table and see how we were doing, nor to apologize/offer to comp our drinks for the horrible noisy table experience.  We know the waitress mentioned it to him early in the evening.  His response was \"normally the party doesn't stand and talk so long.\"  So I guess by the owner it was the party patrons fault that we had a bad experience.  To illustrate our point on the noise,  after our appetizers, while we were having our main course, a table was seated near us, by the party as well.  After 10 minutes they got up and went into the bar to sit where there was live music that was quieter than the party.   I guess the owner is content with his regulars coming in and doesn't value new business potential.  We are disappointed in his attitude and recommend that he stop offering coupons because it doe not fit into his business plan and method of operation.   In the end I guess you get what you pay for.  If we had paid full price my husband would have been more insistent on being treated like a patron dining in a fine restaurant, with his lovely wife, on what was supposed to be a romantic quiet evening.",

I made a reservation for my boyfriend as a surprise birthday dinner last week.  I was a little hesitant planning a birthday dinner at a new restaurant.  What if we didn't like the food or the service was poor?  When we walked in we were immediately greeted by a guy who I'm pretty sure is the owner.  After checking out the menu and FINALLY deciding on a dish (everything sounded great), my boyfriend ordered the seafood risotto and I ordered the rigatoni primavera, a vegetarian dish.  Each dish was served with a salad or soup and they also served fresh bread at every table.  While we were waiting for our food we noticed that the crowd there was much older.  I think we brought the median age down by about 30 years!  I also noticed that the guy who seated us was visiting every table, and chatting with everyone.  It seems like most of the people who were eating there were regulars, and knew all the details about this guys family.  Our salads arrived, and although the portion was small the Italian dressing was delish!  Next came our main dishes.  My boyfriend's plate was packed full of seafood including shrimp, scallops, mussels, and clams.  A bit too fishy for me, but he loved it.  My dish was amazing as well, with lots of flavor and tons of vegetables, including mushrooms, zucchini, and cauliflower.  In past reviews I always mention how it can be difficult to find vegetarian dishes with lots of flavor unless you are at a vegetarian restaurant.  That was not the case here at all, this place delivered.  The portions were big, so my boyfriend and I both ended up with some to take home.  We were both disappointed in knowing we had dinner plans the following night, as we were looking forward to eating our leftovers!  This restaurant was a nice change of pace from our usual loud and crowded old town restaurants.  The place was nice and quiet, with some light music playing in the background.  Overall, it was a great experience, and   I will definitely eat here again.",

And this place does Italian well enough to please my grandmother. My husband and I went for a romantic dinner, and we were not disappointed at the amibance of the place. The owner himself was seating everyone and while it was an air of elegance, we also felt really welcomed. Our waiter Julio brought us our menus and ice water right away, which was great because it was super hot out, even for Arizona. We selected a Chardonnay from Fess Parker vineyards, and because we had a gift certificate from <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Frestaurants.com&s=8b83bf0ff8b716aae84527dc95577a310f201b166dcca25c8ca3824b15703869\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">restaurants.com</a>, we opted to split a bottle of it. It was the first of many great decisions. For our appetizer we split the antipasto for 2. Incredible. Fresh veggies that were perfectly roasted, cold, salty meats, sweet rich cheeses, awesome! Their fresh sourdough bread was a pleasure to eat, with that just right crispy crust and light, fluffy middle. We both had the ceasar salad, which really prepped us well for our meal, as it was well sized and not overly dressed.  I ended up with the seafood risotto and my husband had the baked ziti with sausage. We were stunned. First of all, they came out HOT! Not the luke warm-ness that's becoming too common now, but truly hot! My husband loved his ziti. He went so far as to say it's better the first baked ziti he ever had, which was on New York's Mulberry Street with his parents when he was a teen. My risotto had so many layers of deep intense flavor I was beside myself. Not overly full of seafood, but enough to satisfy the craving, the clams, mussles, scallops and shrimp were to perfection. There was small peices of shredded lobster throughout. The peas, red peppers and asparagus were done well, but not mushy and the rice was just al dente. The saffron lobster bisque broth was intense in flavor but let each aspect of the dish shine through! As much as we were enjoying dinner, we decided to take half of each portion (very large portions, so bring friends or a large appetite or be prepared to take some home) home with us so we could have dessert. I'm so glad we did. We had the vanilla creme brulee. You could actually see the vanilla beans in the custard. And it wasn't overly sweet. Too many are cloyingly so, but not this one! And it had a rather thick ring of the burnt sugar, which I liked, cause to me that's the best thing about creme brulee. The owner, as mentioned by others, was all over the place, but always making time to sit and chat with his patrons to make sure they were happy. Julio was fabulously attentive, not being in our faces, but our glasses were never empty and the pace was perfect. We agreed this is a place we'll be going to at least once a month, if not more!",

We all ordered a glass of  wine but we were never presented with menus.  After about 45 minutes we finally asked for them.  For some reason they were short on menus but sharing was no big deal.  Several of us wanted the fish special but that was all gone.  Seemed strange for a 7:30 reservation but we adjusted our orders to our second choice.  Each meal comes with soup or salad and 3 of us ordered salads.  Turns out they were out of lettuce so two of us refused the chicken noodle soup.  No substition was offered.  The main dishes arrived and the food was good but it was already 9:30.  Nothing was offered to make this right.  Surprisingly poor customer service.",

From the second we walked in and the owner Greg greeted us as if we were old friends to when we left it was nothing short of wonderful.  The waiter was knowledgeable about all the dishes and specials and recommended some very good wines.  Our party ordered clams, mussels, caprese salad, halibut and eggplant parm and everyone enjoyed the authentic flavor and I personally liked the marina.  I know Lori K. Reviewed the bread was hard which to me means she's never heard of sourdough so I wouldn't value her cuisine opinions at all and I can't believe all her negative comments and wonder if she went to the same restaurant as our experience was awesome.  A gentleman we were with couldn't believe it wasn't shipped in from San francisco it was so good and fresh.  Nice relaxing live music and this is now our must go to restaurant in Phoenix.  We went back again that same week... Highly recommend.  It reminds me of a back home neighborhood restaurant with its intimate and unique ambience.  Thank you Greg and we will be back soon.  The people from Branson, Missouri.",

    "text": "First time dining there last night.  Eggplant Parm was great although prepared differently than most.  It came looking like a piece of lasagne which the waiter did describe.  It was very tasty and had a little crispness on top which I like.  Linguine accompanied the dish and it was cooked perfectly.  Marinara was excellent.  Add some cauliflower and brocolli and it was a perfect dish.  A small field green salad was included although the salad was nothing special.  My wife had a special which was sole with a lemon caper sauce.  She raved about it.  Hers also came with linguine and some sauteed spinach which looked great and tasted great, too.  Atmospher was terrific.  Dark, warm and friendly.  Service was terrific.  Greg the wwner circulates and greets all his guests.  Many knew him so he must get lots of regulars.  Singer/keyboard in the lounge at 6:45pm so we only heard a little bit since we had to rush off to the Symphony.  But the performer was very good and NOT LOUD which was wonderful.  Just some night background music that seemed to match the older age of the customers.  We've driven past this place many times wondering what the food was like.  Glad we bought a Local Dines deal which was our incentive to try it out.  We'll definitely return with or without a coupon.  Two entrees, two glasses of wine, 1 cup of coffee = $90 (inl. tax and tip) before coupon.",

    "text": "Wow!  This place is incredible!  One of my coworkers has recommended this place often and wow, she was so right!!  We sat at the bar and had the happy hour small plate calamari (which was the perfect size to share to start) which had the PERFECT texture; it was chewy but not too hard with just the right amount of crisp.  And the red pepper sauce it was served on was divine!   For dinner the man got the Linguini with Fresh Clams and I got the Chicken Parmigiana upon the recommendation of the bartender.   Both came with a choice of soup or salad.  I got the house salad, which was a simple mix of iceberg and field greens with shaved carrots and a roma tomato slice with italian dressing on top (that had just the right amount of acidity) but upon tasting his soup (it was lentil tonight) I was a bit jealous.  The soup appeared to be a broth base with chopped vegetables and lentils, not a thick too-much-lentil type of soup.  It had great flavor without being overpowering. Now for the entrees.  Wow.  When they came out, my eyes popped.  When I smelled, my nose sang.  When I tasted, my mouth weeped.  We had asked the bartender if the clams were just in the sauce or if they were in the shell.  When he said \"both,\" we expected two or three whole clams with a smattering of clam in the sauce.  Boy, were we wrong!  There were 10-12 WHOLE CLAMS atop a garlic and white wine sauce FILLED with chopped manila clams.   The Chicken Parmigiana would have made Sophia Petrillo of Golden Girls relocate to Phoenix!  The sauce was THE FRESHEST, most flavorful, not too wet tomato sauce I've ever had.  In. My. Life.  And I've had my share of tomato sauce, let me tell you!!  The chicken was moist and I'm not sure how the breading didn't get soggy by the last bite, but it didn't!!  The mozzarella cheese on top was melted to perfection.  The plates were served piping hot and we didn't let that slow us down!   The beers were ice cold to the last drop as well, which is a necessity in my book.  The only critique the man had was that they could have a better selection of beers (he likes heavy craft beers).   We will d.e.f.i.n.i.t.e.l.y. be back.  It is a bit pricy, but it's worth every cent!  And happy hour is a great value.  Draft beers are $3, glasses of wine and well cocktails are $5 and they have a selection of \"small plates,\" which are smaller portions of their appetizers, but with the entrees being so incredible AND coming with soup or salad (and don't forget the bread with some balsamic vinegar and olive oil!), you definitely won't leave hungry!  A+++!!!",

I am really impressed as many places I have tried in Arizona and usually the foods don't compare to Chicago.  I wish I had room for dessert but I was full from the salad and meal. Greg again checked on us at the end and I thanked him for making such a great experience for us.  Thank you!",

The live music, dim lights and beautiful table setting set the mood for a very romantic dinner with the wife. Sal was our waiter and did an excellent job helping decide on the perfect meal. He was very thorough with the specials and the preparations of every entree. Being out of towners, he was great with recommending things to do. We ordered the beef carpaccio, and it was the best we've had. I had the house salad and a veal with cannoli and my wife had the chicken soup with the sea food marinara. Everything was delectable and seasoned perfectly. Their Pinot Noir went perfectly with both meals. Great ambiance, great service and overall good time!!",

We got very good service, but the food didn't have much flavor and I think it was just a simple matter of lacking salt and maybe other seasonings. Even the salad dressing, bread and butter were bland. We mixed our own dip of oil, balsamic vinegar, S&P to add some flavor so we could enjoy the bread. We might come back to try some other dishes since it such an inviting place.",

    "text": "We had a need for good Italian.  Whipped out the handy dandy 'Yelp' application and did some intel on the area and came up with L'Amore Ristorante.  Great find!!  Owned by a lovely couple who are customer service focused and run a very nice establishment that warrants a visit from you.  We were seated quickly for lunch and we had a terrific server, Lena.  She was spot on for everything we needed and anticipated our every need.  Great start!  I wish I had the dinner menu as it looked really good as well.  We had the Eggplant Parm with their soup of the day.  The Eggplant Parm was very nice.  I had them add extra sauteed onions and bell peppers to the dish. It elevated the dish to the point where I wanted more. It is served with sauteed spinach and the dish was really good.  The only thing I wish they did was to add a small portion of pasta to the dish with their sauce.  It would be a bit more fulfilling.  The cheese Totellini was was also nice and had good flavor.  Next time, I would add a sausage and veggies to this as well.  To finish off a nice lunch, we had a slice of Lemonchello Cake.  Flavor-wise, terrific!!!  It just needed to be brought up closer to room temp as it was served straight out of the fridge and the cake lost some of its moistness.  If another way was looked at, on how to store this cake, so it is not so hard, when you eat it, it would be 100% perfection.  I highly reccomend anyone to come and try out the tasty food at L'Amore.",

Maybe that's why he feels the need to compensate and be a jerk.  How pathetic to think that everyone has to like your restaurant and if they don't, you curse them out.  Childish and unprofessional.",

Workers/servers not assigned to stations made for confusion and poor table service.... workers rushing around trying always to catch-up and satisfy customers needs....UNDERSTAFFED. Food Quality vs Price Point: Food quality was fair however, the price point would have called for much more authentic upscale Italian food. Caesar Salad: the dressing WAS NOT made to order and tasted like it cane from a #10 pre-prepared food service Company such as Sexton.  Deserts were good. Nice atmosphere, UNDERSTAFFED and a bit OVERPRICED relative to the quality of food.",

I had the poached salmon that was out of this world. Not very many restaurants offer poached. It was perfectly done and delicious. The accompaniments, pasta and vegetables were also good as was the salad with delicious salad dressing. The bread was even WARM when is was served. Not many restaurants serve warm bread which I think is a big mistake....... a lack of details.  Anyway, the owner and his wife are present and hands-on. Greeting dinersand making sure all is right. The way it should be and it shows the hard work that goes into running a successful restaurant.   They were out of veal but that's ok because the salmon was delicious and I'll return for the veal.",

Maybe their dinner portions are big? I opened the take home box only ONE time and the tab broke. I had to cover my ears and said to several people (it was several because the first people that came over wouldn't help)  when they came over in a normal tone of voice to please lower the loud pounding music. When we left we misplaced the keys, my mom went back in to find them and found them.  The car wasn't running with no key in it!

I had to wait a few minutes to be seated because no one was manning the host podium. A couple of people were in front of me who had not yet been waited on as well.  Very expensive wine on the menu, and probably some cheaper wine as well. I don't drink, so I don't care.   They only had balsamic or Italian salad dressing. Whatever happened to thousand Island? Or what about even Ranch? It seems they are going by the wayside. So, I chose not to have the salad that came with my pasta and instead ordered the Caprese salad. It was delicious with huge leaves of flavorful basil, Sweet tomatoes. Yum.  I was hungry for Pomodoro, and they did not disappoint.  It was just delicious cappellini, with plenty of Pomodoro sauce. The bread that came with the meal was very good, and real butter, which is the only thing to serve with real bread.  My first Italian restaurant in Arizona, and I am well pleased. And just for the record, I don't consider a pizza joint an Italian restaurant.  My check was 40 bucks. Well worth it.  Eat here!",

Everyone there seems to be enjoying themselves. The price was about middle of the road for a night out. The food was super good. My date had the seafood and I had the chicken with a ceasar salad.

The restaurant is nice, and we didn't see this review below that said it appeals to the older crowd (we are in our twenties), but it definitely does (almost every single table). The restaurant has low lighting and nice space between the tables (didn't feel crowded). It got a little loud at a couple of points but we still had good conversation. The table next to us must've been some sort of local \"celebrity\" because his table got a lot more attention than the others. Tbh I didn't mind because I prefer not having some sort of staff talking to us every five minutes, I just thought it was interesting.   The wine list is decent and priced well. My boyfriend had the lasagna bolognese which was a lot better than my gnocchi. The gnocchi was done well just plain. I wish it came with muscles or clams or some sort of veggie mixed in because after an entire plate of potato dumpling, it's kind of boring.   I probably wouldn't go again for a date night, but might bring my grandmother there for her birthday if she were to visit me in Arizona. She would like the old school, classic atmosphere.",

Laura our food and drink hustler extraordinaire was incredible and made us feel like her favorite customer she ever had.  She is wonderful!  But besides the food, the service and the general happy vibes coming out of this place were the owners - Kim and Greg.  They definitely made my GF and I feel like old friends and made us feel that we had better be back soon to see them.    So, my new favorite go to Italian restaurant is L'Amore!

My husband made reservations for our group of 25 about 10 days in advance. The owner, Greg, called him to confirm a couple nights ahead. They set us up in the back area to accomdate our large group namd allowed my family to put up a few nice decorations. The staff was very accommodating and friendly, and the owners came by several times to ask if we needed anything. We had bruchetta and fried calamari for appetizers. The calamari is the best I've ever had. They had gruper and scampi risotto that night which my husband and I ordered. The food was very good! Some other guests ordered items such as spaghetti and marinara,  and tortellini and said those were also delicious. There was a nice relaxing atmosphere which is ideal for families as well as couples. They allowed an outside cake and ice cream, which we served but they provided utensils. When it was time to sing Happy Birthday, they dimmed the lights and the entire restaurant joined in which included the live singer, who was nice to listen to. Overall experience was extremely enjoyable and I plan to return very soon.",

When I arrived, I was told that the kitchen was closed and they were not going to serve me, the employee even said \"we are kinda the place that closes early when nobody is here\". It was over half an hour until they say that they are supposed to close. If they like to be lazy and cut corners by closing shop early, imagine the corners they are cutting while preparing your food. Like I said, this was my first time visiting the restaurant and they wouldn't even serve me, even though it was during their regular business hours. Clearly this owner has no idea how to run a business if he thinks turning away paying customers is going to result in more profit and good word of mouth reviews.  EDIT: After reading the other reviews I am glad that I didn't waste my money here. Judging by the way the owner responds to negative reviews on here, I can tell they have a stick so far up their ass that it's poking into their brain and causing them to make some very poor business decisions. I am waiting to see what response the owners have to this review (likely to be written at a 3rd grade level) and will be rooting for this establishment to go out of business in the meantime.",

My husband had the short ribs and cannelloni, and I had linguini with clams.  The short ribs were melt in your mouth, and the cannelloni was light and delicious.  My linguini had more clams than I have ever experienced with this dish elsewhere, and the linguini itself was exquisite.

    "text": "With 32 reviews and 4.5 stars I had high hopes. We were sorely disappointed.   The Restaurant:  Dated decor, Christmas lights everywhere (in Feb). Poor layout.  The Drinks:  bad wine and poorly made vodka cocktail made this a waste of time.   The Food:  Mediocre would be a compliment. The ziti and tortellini were terribly underseasoned. The salad was lettuce carrots and oil. Even the bread was subpar.   The Service:  Our server started off well but went downhill fast. No recommendations, MIA for 20 minutes and taking \"the food wasn't too bad\" as a compliment made this experience unenjoyable.   The Price:  There's not much worse than over paying for lackluster food.  I can cook better at home.   The Verdict:  Any other Italian restaurant is a better choice. Pick the next one.",

I find these places to eat from my Alaska Airlines web site. They partner with several restaurants and when I travel I sometimes search out new places to eat.  I entertained a business client tonight and had a great meal.  The service was excellent, the owner Greg has a great personality. Ask him about his barnyard wine list that's not published. He recommended an off the wall wine called \"If you see kay\" (read it again slowly and you will get the double speak) It was very good and reasonably priced.  The food - Spectacular. I had the Cippino. It was loaded with seafood and I had them make it a little spicy. One of the best dishes I have ever had. The scallops were huge and tasty. I would order this time and time again. Everyone had a good meal. No complaints on anything.  We were there about 2 hours, no pressure to leave. They let you be and set your own pace. I loved it!",

We made a reservation online a few hours ahead and when we arrived to the restaurant we were seated immediately. Promptly after sitting down, we were greeted by the owner who was so welcoming and kind. The service from both the owners and the waiters were top notch. Our waiter was Sal and he was super helpful, especially since we are from out of town. He filled us in on the best places to visit in the area and also gave great suggestions from the menu and wine selection. The food was great- I had the gnocchi with chicken while my boyfriend got the baked ziti with sausage. On top of the great service and great food, the ambiance was awesome with live music and all.

We walk in and it has the \"family\" feel to it - real cozy and quaint.  It took some time for someone to even acknowledge us as it seemed like the people that came before us knew the employees/owner.  So we sat down and right away, I felt unwelcomed.  Service was slow and it seemed like no one wanted to service us.  While we wait patiently for some acknowledgement, water, someone to take our order, etc.  We started noticing that we were definitely out of place.  My friend and I are in our young early thirties, dressed nice, and ready to take on the night.  We look up and everyone (I kid you not) are a lot older, old couples, or friends that are all within the same age group.  The employees started coming up to most of them and they were all laughing as if they've known each other for years.  Then I realized that I truly do not belong here...    We ordered calamari and the Black Garlic Shrimp & Sausage.  The calamari was good.  The shrimp and sausage was not.  No one even asked us how our food was.  It took forever to get our check.  No one said farewell to us.     Ambiance is nothing like Federal Pizza, The Parlor, or any other restaurants on Camelback corridor.  Moral of the story - if you're older, then maybe you will have a better experience.",

He picked this place based on other Yelp reviews and I must admit at first I was skeptical. I have dined at a lot of restaurants in the Arcadia/Biltmore area which are usually very flashy & trendy and almost make you forget how great these hidden gems can be. It is unsuspecting on the outside but offers such high quality food and an overall very genuine, authentic experience. We were personally seated by the owner of the restaurant and felt so welcomed right away. The atmosphere is very classic and reminds me of Italian restaurants in New York. Our server Francesca was the absolute sweetest and made our occasion feel very special. I was suffering from really bad heartburn and she brought me soda water with bitters which totally cured me and allowed me to enjoy my evening. We started with the Mussels and holy cow. Probably the best mussels I've ever eaten in Arizona. They were so plump and fresh tasting and the sauce was to DIE for. It was hard to stop eating it with the amazing bread. For entrees we had one of the daily specials- grouper picatta and then baked ziti with sausage from the regular menu. The grouper was so immaculately prepared and the sauce was incredible. We were treated to some flourless chocolate cake at the end which did not disappoint either. I seriously cannot say enough good things about this place and urge you to give it chance. Can't wait to go back.",

    "text": "On a Wednesday night with a reservation and about 1/2 - 2/3 of the tables occupied, we waited about 5 minutes at the hostess station before being noticed and seated.  We then waited another 10 minutes before being given menus. (The busboy did bring us bread and water while we waited and our water glasses were never more the 1/2 empty the whole night.)  After sitting for 5 minutes or so with the menus the waiter stopped by, asked if we wanted wine, and when we told him no we were just drinking water, he turned and left.  He finally came back a few minutes later and took our order.    The food came out within a normal time period and was outstanding, the highlight and saving grace of the evening.  Caprese salad was delicious served with a pile of cold crisp spinach and the eggplant parm was easily the best I have ever had.    We ordered a desert to share and I ordered a cup of coffee.  It wasn't until I was 1/2 way through the cup that I noticed a long string of, I think some kind of dried pieced of lettuce or other kind of produce, stuck to the inside of the cup.  (In the dimmed lights I had noticed it and thought it was a highlight design in the china.)  When asked if I wanted a refill, I pointed it out and politely declined, asking for the check instead.  (the waiter did deduct the coffee from the bill.).   Lastly, entrees were listed as including soup or salad.  When we were not asked our preference upon ordering our meal, we assumed it was because we had ordered a caprese salad to share.  When the bill arrived, we were charged for the caprese salad so realized we should have asked  what kind of soup was being offered with the meal.    Manager or owner, not sure which, was working the room and made us feel welcome even apologizing for the initial wait at the door.  Busboy was definitely on top of keeping our water filled and clearing our dishes in a timely manner.  Food was absolutely amazing.  If only the over all service had been better and had they caught the 2 inch piece of dried food in my coffee cup, we would have given 5 stars.",

We had a large party with my wife's parents. my brother-in-law, his husband, and our kids, but that wasn't a problem for them at all.  In fact, the service was excellent and extremely friendly from our waiter and even the owner coming by to check on us. The selection of food was excellent and everybody enjoyed their food. I had the cioppino, my kids split a chicken piccatta, and my wife had the chicken marsala. Others had various options. I highly recommend this place for an evening out, and you don't even need to wait for a special occasion, just go if you want a good meal and an enjoyable night.",

Both were excellent.  I had the Gnocchi with Bolognese and it was the best i've ever had.  We will definitely dine here again!",

I recommend this pace and if I could give it a 10 I would . So nice to be personally greeted by the owners who took time to chat with us make recommendations and make sure everything was to our liking. Our dishes were halibut, salmon and short ribs which were  cooked to perfection and came out hot. Bread was plentiful and wine was excellent. Such a great experience. Just go there and enjoy!!!

Within an hour, I got a call from the owner asking to confirm the reservation and to ask if it was for a special occasion. We got to the restaurant and were greeted by the owner and his wife. He remembered me from our phone call earlier in the day. We sat on the patio and were greeted by our waiter Tim. We were treated like guests in someone's home. We weren't rushed to order, they brought delicious bread out and gave us the specials right away. I ordered the cioppino  and my wife ordered the sausage backed Zitti. The food was amazing. The owners stopped by on several occasions to check on us. The owner even boxed up our leftovers. Very passionate about their patrons. From the sound of the other people at the restaurant, they get a lot of repeat business. Highly recommend this Italian restaurant. Very relaxing and never had to find our waiter. Great experience.",

    "text": "L'amore is a wonderful Italian restaurant on the corner of Lincoln & N 32nd St. I was treated to a mind boggling amount of food for a holiday event hosted by Kiss Me Kate. The service by Sal reminded me of a quintessential New Yorker. Quick with a funny line, excellent timing and dressed in black. (Black pants, but still. In New York we wear black.)  If you read no further, remember this: Cioppino.  Chee-oh-PEE-noh  The dish is not on the menu for some reason. If you gaze upwards to a chalkboard you might notice it. Come hungry, or come with a date, but everyone should order this.  Chee-oh-PEE-noh.  A seafood stew, complete with scallops, calamari, shrimp, clams, mussels and a white fish. (The white fish varies on a nightly basis.) My palate was delighted to order it Fra Diavalo. (I heard Fra Diablo, but that was close enough. Hot. Spicy hot.) This entire medley is served on a bed of linguine.  L'Amore has been owned and operated for 13 years by Kim and Greg. Greg was beyond attentive to our table. If you look around the restaurant their passion for riding horses is evident.  The lighting is subdued but yet the mood is festive. This is where you bring friends and family. Any guest will be impressed. Live music is played on the bar side which filters over softly to the dining area. Sal, our friend, was able to balance a large party with infinite ease. When the Cinderella hour rang we left begrudgingly.  Chee-oh-PEE-noh.",

They are on top of it. It's the kind of place where you feel like a regular after one visit. We weren't even dressed for it, but decided it's Arizona ... no one really has a dress code.   I don't remember what wine we drank, but we killed a bottle pretty quickly. Want to make dinner enjoyable? Drink some damn wine and loosen up. I was so surprised to read that a few people felt out of place here. I have only been once and I was treated like I was their longtime valued customer. It was awesome! I seriously haven't been treated this well at a restaurant since my grandfather was alive. The owner even insisted on refilling our wine after we paid the bill. Come on, you know you'll be back after that.   On to the food. This is the ONLY time I have ever liked gnocchi at a restaurant beside's Avanti. This is a huge compliment coming from me. This has never happened. I would never forsake my beloved Avanti ... not until now. Now I have a total of two places in the whole of Arizona acceptable for ordering gnocchi. Thank, god.

    "text": "This is the most disappointing dining experience I've had in years. The reviews made this restaurant look fantastic. The menu touts handmade pasta. But what we received was neither.   We ordered the chicken picatta and the eggplant parmigiana. I worked for a time at Macaroni Grill, and let me just say that the eggplant parmesan at Macaroni Grill is FAR superior. The eggplant was greasy and limp, as if fried at too low a temperature or several hours ago. I requested the pasta marinara, which was, as it turns out, penne pasta with bland marinara sauce dumped on top. The sauce was glassy and watery, not well-salted, and not well flavored. The penne was NOT handmade. I've had better pasta from a grocery store.   The chicken picatta was truly awful. The picatta sauce was clearly made with cornstarch (not a typical ingredient in picatta sauce, for the record) and had very little flavor, other than the bountiful capers. It looked like glue, and tasted very similar. It was served with pasta marinara (six tubes!) and about 6 pieces of steamed vegetable, which was not cooked through.   For a total of $68 (tip not included, but we did have wine), this was a huge waste of money. I would not return.",

    "text": "First let me preface this review with the fact that it was late when we dined there, about an hour before closing.   The service was fabulous. Best service I've had in some time and very professional.   I ordered the Linguini with Clams and my husband ordered Spaghetti Bolognese. Both came with either soup or salad. The soup was good, the salad was very over dressed - the dressing was great, just way too much of it on the salad.  The Spaghetti was good, and the Bolognese sauce was nice and flavorful & a bit spicy. The pasta was more than al dente, but still good.  Unfortunately my dish was not good. There was a very small pile of way over cooked linguini under a very healthy serving of clams. I don't mean the pasta was just a bit over cooked, it was totally mushy & broken into little pieces. I wouldn't serve Linguini in that condition at home even on a week night in a rush!  The clams were swimming in sauce - which I was kind of excited about - I love lots of sauce. But the sauce was bitter. Perhaps from cooking too long, I'm not sure. It was just very sharp and bitter.   My husband wanted to send it back, but the kitchen staff had apparently already left per our waiter.   I ate about half of it - only be aide I was so hungry. And there wasn't really any other option if the cooks were gone.  We were still charged for the dish, which I didn't think was appropriate.   Not a good experience.",

I wanted a veal dish with a Marinara sauce but only saw it on the menu served with a Marsala sauce. I asked my waiter if it was possible to have it made with the Marinara, and to my liking, it was! My wife also had the Veal Piccata, which was very tasty. We saved room for a slice of Limoncello for dessert which came served in a beautiful presentation with a raspberry drizzle and fresh strawberries, and well-chilled to boot. The atmosphere of the restaurant is pleasing and tastefully decorated as well; the background music was very soothing, and the prices were very reasonable.
