We came into town for a wedding and when I learned Naples certified pizza was here we had to try it. Amazing pizza. Owner very friendly and accommodating. Owners family and my family are from the same town in Italy. Thank you for showing the U.S. Quality pizza. My kids ate a ton of pizza and even ate the crust. They never eat the crust.",

Place is a little too trendy for my style.",

    "text": "The pizza is really excellent. Top notch Italian ingredients and fantastic sauce. Thin crust but not burnt, with a chewy rather than crispy texture. We really, really love the pizza here. Good selection of beer and Italian wine.  The quality of the pizza allows us to overlook the inconsistent service and entirely indifferent host staff. If you want to have good pizza in a place that seems to barely tolerate you, this is the spot. It is really strange, as we were regular customers at the previous location at the Borgata and we have been to the downtown location a number of times, and never had any issue with service or staff at either of those places. It's kind of like they decided since they were in a slightly ritzier area they'd get an attitude to match. still: go for the pizza.  UPDATE: within a day of submitting this review, Pomo management contacted me to ask about the experience and why I felt the host/service was not up to par. I let them know my thoughts and they can address it however they please. I was glad to see that Pomo responds professionally and will accept constructive criticism, which is the sign of a place that will succeed. Again, the pizza is excellent, and if they address some of the issues I raised I'd gladly give this place five stars.",

Yes the food was good, but I'm sorry...service is also part of the experience.  Judging by an overheard conversation between the mgr and a customer, ours wasn't the only bad experience of the night.  Since I wrote the above review, I was contacted by the restaurant .  They apologized, assured me they try hard to train staff, and invited us back to try them again.  We will probably do so but will wait until a less crowded time of year.",

We just elected to go Grimaldies where we had a wonderful time in DC ranch.  It is sad when an attitude and a specter of insolence brings down a restaurant.

Our server named Chris was in \"a hurry\", demonstrated poor communication, and barely attended to us during my wife's birthday dinner, so we were a bit disappointed. He made an annual special occasion a subpar experience for us.   When he finally took the time to visit us and requested for our order, he did not recommend any wine to us either. Neither did he ask \"Are you guys celebrating anything special?\"   So, usually we receive good service here and we go out of our way to travel to Pomo, but they (owners and management) truly need to filter out the wait staff that is all about \"making money\", doing more with less and make it more about truly serving customers in a timely way with quality service.  Problem we experienced: after he visited us after 20-25 mins of waiting for him to take the order, there was a delay after this to deliver the wood fired pizza to the table because he held the order, since the lasagna we ordered took longer to prepare- at least that was the excuse we heard. However, he did not communicate it to us in this way prior to taking order, and we could have opted to have the pizza first which arrived cold at our table! Nice job, Pomo!!!   But, Pomo- please do yourselves a favor and augment your wait staff and retrain these young waiters who have no idea how/when food is prepared and to take time out to serve and understand your customer's needs.",

As we were walking in, a group was walking out talking about how delicious the food was and as we were walking to our table all of the other food looked delicious on others' plates. Not only were all of our selections delicious, our experience was made so much more enjoyable by the excellent service. Our waiter, Ilario, was awesome! He was so friendly and attentive, which makes any dining experience more positive and memorable. This is definitely a go-to restaurant now for us in Scottsdale. We highly recommend!",

It steams on the plate causing pizza to become soggy.  My friend ate her pizza with a fork.  Heck Fired Pie is better at. 1/3 of price.  I don't need to pay hi scottsdale prices for mediocre pizza. Server was attentive but saw us as a low tip table as no drinks. I'll not return",

Thin crust with fresh ingredients. You can't beat it.   The fresh ingredients are excellent. I ate cold leftover slices later that night and in the morning. And still tastes good. A few days later we ordered pick up from here. Eating in the restaurant is definitely better. But the taste is still phenomenal.",

As always I got a Margherita pizza, They offered buffalo mozzarella so I went with that. The presentation and the flavor were great and overall it was a very good product. I ordered it uncut so I could use a fork and knife and what I found was that the dough was a little crisp. It is great for eating with your hands but in my opinion strays a little from a True Neapolitan Pizza. Other than that I have no complaints and if I could give them 4 1/2 stars I would:)",

I've had pizza from all the 'pizza cities' - New York, Boston, Philadelphia, Chicago, New Haven..... My wife and I came to Pomo to taste the pizza that gets rave reviews and many claim superior to Pizzeria Bianco. We started with a Caprese Salad. The Buffalo Mozzarella was moist, excellent consistency, and just the right amount of salt.  The tomato tasted like a hot house or hydroponic variety and the basil  and olive oil lacked serious flavor.  We also shared a Crocchete Pugliesi, an interesting combination of potato, mozzarella, and prosciutto.  The accompanying tomato sauce complemented the appetizer nicely.  Finally, we had a Pomo pizza.  Overall, it's a better than average pizza but not in the same class as Pizzeria Bianco's Wiseguy.",

If I could give one suggestion, when you eat here, order more!  Buy three pies for 2 people and take the rest home.  It's great the next day after being heated in the oven for a few minutes.  The arancini and meatballs are also worth considering to start the meal.",

    "text": "I came to this place for this first time the night before mother's day, I ate in the \"luna\" section because the other part was already full. Our waiter kind of took awhile when it came to bringing the drinks out, my boyfriend had ordered a second beer but ended up asking for them not to bring it out since we had finished our food & were about to get ice cream. Our pizza was ridiculous. I really wanted to ask them to take it back, but as someone who worked in a restaurant before, I know how annoying that is. Did you guys hear about Shane Dawson's Chuck E. cheese theory? Because that's how our pizza looked. The slices were more than uneven. We were splitting the pizza, but anyway we tried to split the pizza wasn't fair. There was a piece that was maybe 5\" and then there was a piece that was almost half of the pizza. I'm not sure who cut that pizza, but they shouldn't have thought that it looked good enough to go out to the customer. The bathroom is weird. I don't appreciate the white fog glass in the stalls, because you can literally see someone's silhouette. I wore a jumpsuit that day, so I was very uncomfortable when someone else came into the bathroom. Also, whoever put the protection paper for the toilet seat inside the thing, put in backwards. I had to ruin about 3 before I was able to take one out without tearing it.",

    "text": "I like Pomo because it's casual, close to my home, the food is really good, and it's a lively atmosphere. It's a neighborhood restaurant.   I feel comfy sitting at the bar by myself (not a pick up joint), or in the dining room. I recently brought my friend Nancy here for her birthday because she loves the minestrone soup and the eggplant parm. That is her standard order for Pomo. I don't know why I've never tried either because they both look really good - the minestrone is full of chunky veggies. It looks very savory.  I always order the Strozzapreti (not sure if I spelled that correctly.) This dish is alll about comfort food. I really don't like eating pig, but this dish is made with ground sausage. But it doesn't taste like sausage!  It tastes more like ground beef because I don't taste heavy seasoning and spices that would otherwise be expected from sausage. The noodles are a bit chewy - very al dente, which I LOVE. And the sauce is a nice red gravy. They garnish with a tiny sprig of rosemary, which really takes the flavor over-the-top. As I say, it's comfort food - I even order it in the summer, when you'd anticipate it being too heavy and hot.   This last visit, I ordered a craft cocktail - the Italian Mojo. I love mules and mojitos, and this was a cross between the two. It had a very minty flavor to it, yet refreshing. The portion was nice too - I really liked the flavor. I'm glad it's offered year-round, because I also saw the seasonal cocktail list, which also looked excellent.  I give their Service a \"c\" rating not because the personalities of the waitstaff are negative or off-putting, but because they seem short-staffed. The wait to get water is long. The wait to place a drink order is long. The wait to place your food selection is long. And then there's the long wait until you receive your dish. I assume the wait for the food is long because each dish is created anew, but still - it's always a long wait to get a drink, pay or otherwise be attended to. Again, the personalities are great - they just need more waitstaff.   The volume is loud in this restaurant because it's open and airy, without drapes or carpet or any other sound buffering fabric. This is not a place to go to the bar and sit with a book as you eat. This is a place where you go to the bar, sit and watch the tv while you eat.   I've only ordered the pizza once here. Upon placing my order, I was asked if I wanted my pizza \"wet\". I had no idea what that meant, and honestly, calling a pizza wet is unsavory. Basically it means it's a little undercooked so the cheese and dough aren't burnt - no black on the crust. I honestly like hand-tossed pizza elsewhere (see my other reviews), but I wouldn't say Pomo's Pizza tasted bad at all.   There have only been a couple times when it's so busy at Pomo that there was a wait, so now, even on slow nights, I make reservations.",

So even if we wanted to ask what's taking so long (or- what I really wanted to do, and just pay her for our food and leave), we couldn't. I expect a Saturday night during spring training to be busy, but that was just downright ridiculous. We were at our table for three hours, and she came back to fill our drinks... once? Maybe twice? Even once we paid, it took 20 minutes to get our cards back. As for the food, we had a pretty broad spread between everyone and I was able to try a few things. I'd say it's middle of the road Italian food (which I was surprised by because the owner is actually Italian, and it came very highly recommended). Maybe I'll be back for lunch when it's not busy, but probably not.",

Also their was so much more pasta than sauce I felt like I was just eating pasta. Not a fan. My husband is an ER doc & will eat anything put in front of him.

It took 30 minutes to finally arrive and it was a dried out piece of cake. Not the molten lava that was listed nor did it come with vanilla gelato as advertised. When we asked about it our waiter told us it was an old menu we ordered from and ended up taking it off our bill. I would not recommend this place and won't be back.

    "text": "Interesting and creative thin crust, including super thin crust pizzas.  Not the place for your usual pizza.  Thin crust was delicious.  Sadly they lacked your more typical toppings offering fro-fro toppings instead.  How about expanding your menu and offering both - I bet that would draw more customers in.   Service was adequate but could have been better given how few customers they had.  However...only noticed after leaving restaurant that they had charged us for a glass of wine that we did not order.  Went back the next day to get my money back.  Had to wait for the MIA manager.  When he arrived his attitude was far from apologetic instead making me feel as if I was wrongly asking for money.  He then freely offered that they don't even have that wine in stock so clearly we didn't have it.  Hmmmm, let's try assuming honesty and then when you realize it was clearly wrong make True amends.   Wine was on receipt for $10.00.   Manager says well if you had come back right away I could have reversed that off the credit card charge. Again, blaming me for their mistake.  So, then he goes quiet as if I had to solve issue.  He finally offers to give me $10 in cash.  Wow, that was really thinking.   However, I still left cheated as there was tax on that wine that he did not refund and I had calculated the tip on that as well, so all-in-all I have to return the next day to get my money, be made to feel as if I was the one who did something wrong and then fundamentally cheated on what they should have refunded me, and I amends for the inconvenience.   Was this a one-off or a recurring situation?  Everyone review your check before paying!",

Luckily we did have a few appetizers to tide us over (Bread is $2 FYI and they don't carry pesto?)  - What we ordered: Kale salad (waste of money and not good) , Bruschetta (actually tasty), wood-fired pizza (soggy crust, did not impress me at all..didn't even taste wood-fired) Spaghetti Bolognese (My Dad sent it back, it tasted like hamburger helper)   The food quality is very mediocre for the price you pay.

Crust a tad on the breadish side, but I finished with a clean plate.  Everyone else had pizzas with the standard cheese and tomato sauce + toppings. I tried one slice out of curiosity. What a difference. It's like comparing apples and crap. I spit it out. They all ate half their pizzas at most.",

You walk into a Scottsdale restaurant or bar in season and, in some cases, you get a face full of attitude and sour grapes. Not at Pomo. You walk in and you're greeted by friendly, sweet faces, who seem genuinely pleased to welcome you. What a wonderful change! We walked into a few restaurants tonight and just couldn't handle the 'tude. We walked into Pomo and those girls were just awesome!!!  We stayed longer than we planned, and ate and drank more than we intended. And I say it was 100% due to the warm atmosphere and kind greetings.   Thank goodness we have options like Pomo that serve the good food, make the awesome drinks, and demonstrate what service with a (real) smile feels like. Cheers to you, Pomo, and I raise a glass to your awesome staff. Especially the ladies at the hostess station. That's the way to do service with a smile!",

All the waiters are extremely attentive and clear plates immediately, are open to questions, refill water as soon as you finish, and our waiter even wiped off the spilled balsamic vinegar from the table within seconds. The interior is super modern and very well designed with bar seating as well. Great price too. Cannot say enough about this place!!! (Get the Nutella pizza- not on the menu, a hidden gem).",

I did have to ask what a few of the ingredients were, but the server was more than willing to educate me with enthusiasm.  There's also a small grocer on one side where you can pick up a quick lunch or ingredients to use at home.  Definitely worth a return visit!",

There's a shaded outdoor patio (a little too cold at the moment), as well as indoor seating. The service is friendly, and the food is delicious.  We shared the POMO pizza (comes with sausage, mushroom, bellpeppers, and onions), the lasagna, and the Capri panini (with Italian sausage, sauteed mushrooms, roasted red bell peppers, sauteed onions, & evoo). The pizza and panini were very good, with quality bread/crust and very fresh-tasting ingredients. I didn't really like the lasagna that much - a little too rich and creamy, and the pasta felt soft and a little overcooked.  Definitely a solid experience though.",

    "text": "The Valley has an abundance of pretty delicious pizza, so it's hard to stray from some of your current favorites to check out anything unfamiliar. But I am so incredibly glad to have met Pomo and its delicious pies from Napoli. Having spent quite a bit of time in Italy (mostly eating) and having never met a True Italian pizza in the US - this place has moved up several notches on my preferred pizza scale given its authenticity. My perfect pizza is one with perfectly, gently burnt crust and the perfect (aka light) amount of sauce to toppings ratio - one that begs for a glass of wine. Ecco-la.  The Scottsdale location is lovely.The inside looks delightful and inviting, though I've only enjoyed the patio which is also extremely pleasant. Excellent wine choices for the vino lovers and the menu has something delicious for anybody or any mood. The Mista salad was refreshing and simple (though a tad heavy on the dressing). Both the Bufala and Ortolana pizze were fantastic. We were lucky enough to enjoy Pomo's personal pizzas at the Italian Festival last weekend - a staff member told us the owner's mother made all the dough for the festival the night before. Sure enough she was rolling it out right there per order! Their ability to make a pie on the fly that was just as good as those served at the restaurant was very impressive.  Bravo Pomo. Bravissimo!",

The outside misters worked really well & made the patio a pleasant dinner experience despite the heat.   Great for groups and as a date place-- it's casual but classy, so it's a comfortable but slightly upscale experience.   The pizza was absolutely delicious! Crust was thin and chewy but also with the slightest bit of crisp. It's definitely a large pizza but not too filling since the crust is thin. Great to share if you get a salad and pasta dish as well.   The only dish I wasn't impressed with was the pasta dish we had. I love fresh pasta but the pasta here was too al dente-- chewy for me-- I like slightly al dente, but this one was working my jaw muscles a bit too much.",

    "text": "Over a year and a half ago, we moved to Scottsdale and my husband took our family to Pomo, bc this is where he sometimes took clients when he was here for business. We ordered our pizzas and some appetizers to share. Once the pizzas came we realized that my daughter and I got charred pizzas. We ate the appetizers and only ate a few uncharred bites of our own pizzas, leaving all the rest on our plates. The waiter finally came and looked at the two full plates and asked how everything was. We told him that two of our pizzas were burnt, to which he said: \"Oh, you should have told me sooner, I would have gotten you two new ones\"! Now, it was latish in the night, but the kitchen wasn't closed and he could have taken the two pizzas back and brought new ones. Needless to say, we never went back. Fast forward to last month. My daughter and I were driving in the area when we saw a sign for an Italian Grocer! I immediately parked and went in to get some Italian goodies to take home. The beautiful young girl behind the register had a Pomo shirt on! I asked her if we had accidentally gone to the side door of Pomo and she said that the grocery store was part of the restaurant! I immediately, but discreetly decided to leave. She was so sweet, that I decided to explain why I was suddenly leaving. I told her why and she said if the owner and manager knew what had happened, they would want to make it right, so she called the manager (Lawson Davis). I was caught off guard as I wasn't expecting to be complaining about something that had happened almost 2 years ago! He walked up and I told him the story. He asked us to have a seat in the dining room and to give Pomo another chance! We decided to stay and a lovely waitress took our order. Before we knew it we were eating pizza perfection like you can only get in southern Italy. the manager was nice enough to come by to check on us and we told him how lovely the pizzas were. He stopped by a little later to ask us what we wanted for desert, but because we hadn't had desert the last time, I told him he would have to charge me for that. Desert was fabulous and when the bill came, he had taken care of it, even the desert!  Mistakes like this happen in the best restaurants, but it's an exceptional staff that can turn a negative experience into a positive and Pomo, not only redeemed itself when it delivered on the food, but equally importantly, the young girl (in the grocery part) and the manager truly made it right and made customers out of sworn ex-customers. We will not only be backas a family, but my husband has already brought clients back and we've recommended Pomo to two sets of new neighbors. Go check this place out if you want authentic, quality, food served by a really great staff.",

We snagged a table on their huge covered patio and settled in. Our server was very attentive, even trying to light our candle again and again every time the wind blew it out.  We ordered the kale salad (which is a version of a Caesar but with kale) and the peppino pizza. The salad was a perfect portion for two people to share. Lots of croutons and fresh parmesan and not too much dressing. It had a good flavor and the addition of kale gave it a heartier texture.   The pizza was delicious. Lots of flavor, the crust was cooked perfectly and just the right amount of cheese. Again, it was a nice size portion for two people to share.  For dessert we chose the cream puffs. They come three to an order and are covered in a yummy, fudgy chocolate. Needless to say, there was not a crumb left on the plate.   Officially adding Pomo to our list of pizza places to visit again!",

We also had the bruschetta, the Crocchete Pugliesi, salami board, Pizza Margherita, and a lot more. And the service was incredible. I will definitely be coming back here next time I'm in Scottsdale!",

PROS:  -Indoor ambiance: modern with a European twist, open, clean, and cute  -Service: knowledgeable and friendly   CONS: -Outdoor ambiance: we sat outside and felt like we were sitting in the parking lot, tight space -Food: we ordered calamari as an appetizer which was quite good. For our entrees, we ordered the 4 cheese pizza and a margarita pizza. Both were mediocre--I could barely taste the 4 cheeses in the pizza, they were bland, and soggy.  -Price: high for the quality",

The cocktails and wine were fabulous and the outside dining/bar will be my better weather happy hour enjoyment.  Even at 100 degrees outside the bar and dining were cranking.  The location also offers imported infused oils that are beyond amazing and worth every penny to create tasty Italy inspired dishes in your own kitchen. The only negative I have is the pasta wasn't anything out of this world. I'd like to see them take the pasta up a notch. . . Good however not great.  #1 wood iron pizza yet!  I will be back!",

Started off with an incredible salad that everything is super fresh and all done in house.  To top that off, you of course have to do a pizza, since the restaurant has a huge center wood burning oven / clave.  But what made the evening was two factors. 1) finding the right wine, the server made recommendations and brought several out to taste till the right pairing was achieved.  2) can't have Italian without ordering Spaghetti with meat bolognese.  Came out and I was so happy with everything else, I shied away from the disappointment of sauce.  After a slight mention and saying next time I will try the other one, suggested.... well, when asking for the check, my server came out with one to go with the other Rosemary sauce and insisted to have it later or next day... which truly blew me away.  I laugh cause in Europe there is no way you get this service, in most cafe you sprall for extra hand towels for instance.  Very happy and Very much so going back.  What a wonderful experience.",

Pomo was fabulous (tons of locally grown and organic options)! We felt welcome from the moment we stepped into the door until the moment we left. Hospitable staff and incredible food. I am pretty picky when it comes to gluten-free pizza, and this has to be some of the best that I have had. My husband had the HUGE calzone and was in heaven...yes, he ate the whole thing. We ended the night with creme brulee! Everything was just perfect, the way date night should always be. I highly recommend sitting in the heated patio area, as the ambiance was just right for a romantic evening. If you see the reviews (like I did before I came), trust them. Pomo will not let you down! We are already planning our trip back.",

We ordered the eggplant parm appetizer and it was delicious. As we were waiting for our entrees, the misters stopped.  A few patrons at the counter asked their server what happened and were told the management turned them off.  We asked our server about the misters and were told they were turned off because they were dripping water on a few of the tables. Rather than accommodating us by changing our table to one indoors, (there wasn't any available) and since we were sweating in the 95 degrees temperature, we were forced to get our dinners to go and leave the restaurant.  The food was delicious however  I gave 2 stars because the management refused to turn on the misters after a few patrons asked.  This is my second time here.   I wasn't happy with the service the first time but decided to give it a second chance.   I will not be back",

No.  All the pizzas at Pomo are thin crust...not a problem for me so long as they hold up all the toppings which, unfortunately it doesn't at Pomo's. But then again, maybe that has to do with how the pieces are cut...all 3 of our pizzas were cut awkwardly. 1 in off-centered quarters...leaving 2 GIANT pieces and 2 tiny ones. 1 into sixths....where 2 were extremely thin and 2 were extremely fat...but at least 2 looked normal. 1 into, can you  believe it, fifths. where 1 was a triangle and 4 were trapezoids of some sort.   Oh, and toppings are not spread evenly...take for example our vegetarian pizza with roasted veggies. It's straight from the menu, but this is how it was delivered. Half eggplant, half zucchini....and a PILE of bell peppers in the middle.   It was good once we spread it around and traded veggies....but come on. This was a common theme for all our pizzas...  Meh.  This place came highly recommended...and thus with high expectations...which, unfortunately, were not met.",

The pizzas were great, some of the pasta even better. It's really a matter of taste beyond a certain point and I spent time in Italy so I have high standards. Cocktails done right, and above all the service was spectacular. You may nitpick something here or there but overall some other area would easily make up for it.   Atmosphere - 5 Service - 5 Food - 4/5 (I've eaten Italian food in Italy, some things were on point and some things were close) Value - 5  I will be returning here, indefinitely, for my Neapolitan fix and fresh pasta cravings.",

They are part of the Verace Pizza Napoletana and Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani so you know it's legit Italian pizza. (Look it up to confirm). So the standard of quality is there.  Try the lasagna. We get it every time. Pasta is cooked well. Great sauce and meat.  For dessert, tiramisu is highly recommended if you have any space left. It is light. Not too sweet.   Service: the servers, pizza makers, and manager are very personable. Each person comes to ensure that the food comes in a timely manner and that you are enjoying the food. It shows they care about their food and service.   Parking: private lot that has valet available during certain times. It can get busy on weekends or events.

We ended up leaving after appetizers and skipping dinner entirely. Food wasn't great, and the service was worse. There was going to be a 45 min wait for dinner, but the hostess told us the bar was open seating. The bar opens up to the outdoor patio, but one side had windows closed. The hostess told us they'd be opening those windows any minute so it'd be fine to sit there. When we sat there, a bartender looked at us through the glass and shrugged. They finally opened the glass and without any hello the bartender \"warned\" us it was going to be super windy where we were sitting, and it was obvious they were annoyed they had to open the windows. We ordered red wine, and the glasses were cold which didn't compliment the wine. We ordered their version of calamari which was definitely sub-par. Their focaccia appetizer what was good, but it takes awhile to come out (and they charge you extra for honey). This all could have been ok if the service was better. The staff was unprofessional (we heard all about how one bartender was going to get drunk that night) and inattentive. It seemed like none of them wanted to be there.

It's extremely fresh (the ingredients attest to this), the toppings are mouth-watering, and the crust is absolutely perfect -- not too thick, not too thin, and crispy (not soggy) deliciousness.  Placed a to-go order and they said it'd be ready in 10 minutes... I sped over there and arrived in about 12 minutes (don't get in my way when I'm hungry) -- but my pizza wasn't ready. No worries though; good things in life take time. So I waited and chatted with the extremely pleasant and wonderful staff -- some that are straight from Italy (that's how you know the pizza is simply amazing!!!), and it just adds to the ambiance of making you feel like you hopped in a teleportation device and went to Italy to pick up a fresh pizza. Well before I knew it, my pizza was ready and I was on my way. I barely made it with the smell of hot bubbling cheese next to me -- I wanted to pull over and eat the whole pizza by myself, forget sharing!   I highly recommend the Bufala Verace pizza!!! Hands down, my favorite!!! It's basically like a Margherita pizza, but better. I didn't think you could make a classic Margherita pizza better, but somehow Pomo did. Mmm... just writing this review is making me crave Pomo. I might just have to run over there and grab some pizza... you know, I think that's exactly what I'm going to do. Tootles!",

    "text": "Pizza is one of my top 3 favorite foods and I love it and eat a lot of it in all its forms - thin crust, thick crust, original crust, stuffed crust, rolled up into stromboli, folded up into a calzone...and Pomo Pizzeria has hands down the best Neapolitan pizza I've had in Arizona. My god everything is spot on fantastic and delicious! I've been many times, and the pizza never disappoints. The crust is perfection - moist, chewy, perfectly crusted on the outside and soft on the inside, slightly smoky/charred from the wood fired oven. The tomato sauce is perfect - bright, flavorful, fresh. The cheese is great, the olive oil is great, the basil is great. And it all culminates into a perfect pizza. My favorite is the Pizza Margherita. My favorite salad at Pomo is the Mango Salad which has lots of fresh arugla, lettuce to balance out the arugula, sharp blue cheese, and some just-ripe mango. The Calzone Napoletano is amazing - it has the wonderful crust and sauce of the pizza, plus more cheese and portions that have a thick crust in addition to the thin crust. It's definitely more filling than the pizza.  I really enjoy the Panna Cotta dessert, which is very light and easy to eat after stuffing yourself silly with good pizza.  Parking is easy and there is a wonderful outdoor patio that seats a good number of people. But sitting inside isn't bad either because of the open kitchen. Friendly and quick service. Absolutely no complaints!",

    "text": "I have yet to experience a fantastic pizza place in Scottsdale or Phoenix, although my stepdaughter claims it is definitely Spinato's. Either way, it certainly was not Pomo Pizzeria Napoletana, which was \"average\" in my book.  We arrived at the restaurant on a Tuesday evening for a 7:00 p.m. reservation. We started with a cocktail, and my bellini was pleasant, but nothing out of the ordinary. My husband and I split a Caprese salad as an appetizer, and it neither looked nor tasted any differently than the ones we put together at home. There were four slices of mozzarella, four slices of tomato, and a four large basil leaves spread across the plate. It tasted fine, but again, it was not anything special.  I ordered the porcini pizza, and found it lacked flavor. The porcini was pleasant, the cheese was as you would expect. The crust was not particularly rich or buttery. The pizza itself seemed to need some fresh herbs or spices to lift it a bit - perhaps even porcini powder would have helped bring out some of the mushroom flavor, which was sparse.  The waitstaff was friendly and helpful, so no complaints there.",

    "text": "My favorite pizza in all of the Phoenix area.  It doesn't matter if you're in Downtown Phoenix or this new location in Scottsdale, you're going to get some of the best pizza you've ever had.    Today was my first venture into their new Scottsdale location.  A friend and I came here after a morning of watching golf at the Phoenix Open.  I've been going to their Downtown Phoenix location ever since it opened in 2013.  The Scottsdale location is nothing like the Downtown Phoenix location in terms of aesthetics and atmosphere.  Whereas their Phoenix location feels more like a small urban neighborhood haunt, this location feels much more like a large upscale suburban restaurant.  There's far more seating both inside and outside at this location and the restaurant also has a mozzarella bar and an assortment of italian grocery items.  That's not to say either location is better or worse than the other at all.  The setup of the Phoenix location works perfectly for the cultural melting pot downtown neighborhood, whereas this location fits perfectly into the more upscale affluent neighborhood it occupies.  But the biggest testament to their brand is whether their trademark pies at the Scottsdale location can match up to their Phoenix location.  Having split a Margherita and a Don Alfonso with my friend today I can attest to the fact that the quality here is as top notch as their Downtown location.  The crust has the same crunchy outside and soft delicious texture inside and the flavors of their ingredients are like a perfect symphony.  Perfect size, perfect temperature, perfectly neapolitan.  If there was one downside to this location, its that we didn't get offered the free fried dough and limoncello as we always have downtown.  But then again the downtown location didn't have a mozzarella bar and grocery operation either.  No matter which location you choose, you simply can't go wrong with the Pomo brand.  Authentic neapolitan pies crafted by a family of Italian immigrants with the certifications to back them up.  Bravo Pomo, you never cease to amaze.",

They have the standard types of wood fired pizzas, and they do make them well and they have great flavor. They will also give you spicy olive oil to sprinkle on your pizzas and pasta if you like. The pasta is firm, just slightly softer than al dente, which I think is perfect! The staff is amazingly friendly, helpful, and prompt. Overall, a really good meal in a very pleasant and casual setting.",

Make sure to get some olive oil to drizzle on the pizza as it gives it an enriched flavor to the pizza toppings itself.  We had a couple different pizzas, but I would recommend the Pomo.  You can add and subtract toppings at your ease without too much complications either.",

Pomo has been on our radar for a while; we were heartbroken when we tried to visit the downtown location and they were in that weird \"closed for the afternoon\" timeframe. (Don't feel bad for us, we ate at Cibo as a consolation.) I heard that they \"reopened\" their Scottsdale location in this space and we've been on a mission to get here ASAP!  Apparently everyone else has as well. We arrived around 4:30 on Friday for a \"woohoo we both got off work early\" celebraish and our only options were to sit outside (a little chilly for that, even by the beautiful fire/heaters. Yes, I'm a wimp.) or one of what I could see only two tables inside that didn't already have a \"Reserved\" sign.  Our server was Marie and she swooped right over, even though we came in the weird \"in-between-meals-time\" and the front of the house team was clearly having their line-up/pump-up schpeel. She told us about how the massive pizza oven (looked like it was covered in gilded pennies!) and it's owner were imported straight from Italy, recommended some of her favorites, and left us to peruse the menu.  We went with two of her recs: the Romano salad, Pomo's take on the classic Caesar. The dressing is veg-friendly and doesn't include anchovies, but is light and lemony and refreshing. Topped with perfectly crunch croutons and piles of freshly-shaved parm, this was definitely big enough for two to split as an appetizer. I also went with the Regina Margherita, a FRESH take on the classic. The fior di latte, the San Marzanos, the fresh basil...it was everything. My boyfriend went with the Pomo, which had Italian sausage, red bells, sauteed mushrooms and onions. Both pizzas were perfectly wood-fired, and the chili oil offered to drizzle over the top was DIE-vine!!! We were both stuffed after two pieces but both made ourselves eat a third!  Overall--a perfect addition to the hood. So glad it's close so we can visit again and again!",

We told the waiter we were in a hurry and they were very accommodating at getting our pizzas out quickly - the Principe and the Don Alfonso.  Would we rate it #1 for pizza?  No, but both of them were good.  The ingredients tasted fresh, the crust was thin but pliable.  The one downside was the floury taste - too much raw flour left on the crust.

It's a cool, almost chic, vibe and everything they prepare here is of the highest quality.  Whether you have a salad, pasta or pizza, it will be a cut above here.  They also have a nice wine list and try to have a few bottles in the low $30s/bottle for those who don't like spending 3x times costco for an average bottle of wine.  Stefano is rapidly becoming one of the best restauranteurs in Arizona.  Come here for high quality cuisine and some liveliness.",

It had some charred on the edges which is a result of the wood fired oven.  It was a good pizza but $18 for a 12 inch pizza is a bit much in retrospect.  The place has a nice buzz to it and people were dressed to the nines just to go to a pizzeria---that's Scottsdale for you.",

The outdoor patio is great, lots of bar seating in and outdoors.  The main dining room fills up so make a reservation-- and if you are last minute just sit up at the Pizza bar and literally observe the pizza making operation.  The food is just GOOD!  The salads are HUGE and should be shared.  The pizzas are pretty much good for one unless you are sharing a salad.    There's no need to waste calories anywhere else. Pomo is dishing out the very best Pizza in town.    The wine list is sufficient with plenty of drinkable options at good prices.  Back to the Pizza-- the ingredients are simple, fresh, flavorful, and leaves you wanting more.  The dough is perfect and you will be fighting over the last piece of crust, especially with the red flake chili oil they offer.  If you have a sweet tooth, their deserts are top-notch. Without question the best Tiramisu in all of Arizona!!!  When you are craving pizza nothing is going to beat Pomo for a real Italia experience.   This is yummmmmm!",

    "text": "As they say, \"time marches on\".  The original POMO was a very special pizzeria, that transported it's diners back to Italy. It was located further south along Scottsdale Road in the Borgata Shopping Center, next to Blanco's. Though small, it had an intimate feel where you could have an easy conversation with you server.  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/pomo-pizzeria-napoletana-scottsdale-2#hrid:DP4ygw0P_5831sjXGX5ecA\">yelp.com/biz/pomo-pizzer...</a>  The \"new\" Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria feels like a concept restaurant, sort of like Fox's Olive & Ivy or North, which is not a bad thing. But gone is that old world Italian Grotto elegance and feel. I guess it's only fitting that it's in the former Blooms space.   Also gone is any mention of POMO's being a certified Napoletana pizzeria, from either APN (Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani) or VPN (Verace Pizza Napoletana). But in truth, the pizzas are still very good and they now have a new, much larger wood fired brick oven.   The square footage feels three times larger. At times it seems like a dozen or so wait staff are rushing around, delivering pizzas to almost forty tables and that is just inside the restaurant. The outside space is equally large, with a heavy duty tarp covering the diners. I eyed at least two Culinary Managers on the floor keeping track of the staff and food. Nice!   The three of us arrived around two o'clock on Black Friday. We were seated pretty quickly, with a good view of the pizza oven. I would highly recommend the location and view. The menu has been updated. And yes it may seem more expensive, given the pricier location near Gainey Ranch and the Hyatt Regency, but it's not.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.pomopizzeria.com%2Fpomo-scottsdale-menu.pdf&s=ff7297ba8cec0af17ce3708a372da15acc98db52fffb96a769c033f37b085f27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">pomopizzeria.com/pomo-sc...</a>.   I started out by ordering a Cappuccino ($4.00) which was as good as anything I've had at the green mermaid. It had a nice taste but lacked foam. My friends ordered a diet soft drink and a black ice tea, both $2.50.   Since we remembered how tasty the bruschetta was at the old POMO's we decided to start there. We had the Sorrentina for $7.95 (see photo), which was very good with a hint of garlic.   Next we decided to share two pizzas. One was their famous Regina Margherita.  It was as tasty and good (though somewhat smaller) as it's predecessor.  I've posted two pictures, a before and after if you will. It was priced at $12.95, same as before.    The other pizza was their Amatriciana, which comes with saute onions and tiny amount of diced panchetta. It too was very good and priced at $14.95. I believe the key to their delicious tasting pizzas, is the constant and watchful eye as they cook in an over 850 F oven.   A new addition not found in the old Restaurante, is a grab and go sandwich annex, called \"Forno Fabbri, an Italian Market & Mozzarella Bar\".  It's to the left as you come into Pomo Cucina and very similar in size and setup to the ones found in Olive and Ivy or the Herb Box. It's a major plus for a quick weekday lunch, one which I will try in the near future.   Our total for three came to $48.42, including taxes but before gratuities. It seemed fair and the food as I've mention is very good. So Four Stars and yes, we are a Fan of the new Pomo Cucina & Pizzeria.   Enjoy!",

We had a reservation here for a work dinner. The server was attentive and answered all of our questions. We never had an empty cup of water. I had the carbonara, my coworker had another pasta the salsiccia, which kind of reminded me of chef Boyardee but way better quality, and my other coworker near me had some kind of pizza with pesto and shrimp on it. Got the burrata as an app. I think everyone on the other side thoroughly enjoyed their food. My carbonara was exactly what I had expected, and somehow I managed to finish the whole thing. Good for groups and just a date night dinner. I would go back but it's definitely nothing I'd crave for if I was in the area again.",

They brought that mural of Sicily from the old place over to this new location. We were with two family members so we started with a couple appetizers,  the Caprese and something I have never had before, the Crocchete Pugliesi (potato croquettes filled with Fior di Latte and prosciutto). Both were excellent and reasonably priced.   Then on to our personal pizzas.  I had the Principe (prosciutto, arugula and shaved parmigiano reggiano). The wife had the Peppino ( ricotta cheese, hot calabrese salami). On the advice of a family member we tried the pizza with a drizzle of their hot pepper flake olive oil.  OMG. I will be doing that from now on. The pizzas were as good as I remembered from the old place and made a great midnight snack straight out of the refrigerator.  :)  I really liked the take out and market place on the left as you walk in.  From what I am told it is a very popular lunchtime option which they didn't have at the old Pomo.",

We arrived at 9pm on a Friday and didn't get our APPETIZER until 9:40... and the Arancini we ordered came out cold in the middle so we had to send them back. They were okay - warm enough the second time but very bland. When our dishes arrived right after that, my Bolognese was not only underdressed but also COLD. And my boyfriends pizza was covered in oil and was soggy.. not crisp whatsoever (his description: \"wet noodle\"). We scarfed down our food to make it to Luna Gelateria which is housed in the same building and got in line at 10:06... apparently they closed at 10 and even though we were in the same restaurant they would not serve us. Very disappointing. Overall our meal of 3 drinks, an appetizer and two entrees was about $85 not including tip and we thought for the quality of service (no they did not take off the appetizer that took over 30 minutes to come out in a practically empty restaurant off of our bill) and even the taste of the food was not worth it. To be honest, Olive Garden beats Pomo. I recommend Stone and Vine and North over this restaurant any day in every circumstance. Will not be going back.",

The platter was weak two chunks of parm, one salami, one proscutto and canned veggies.  The pizza was wet. The crust was tasty.  The toppings were just ok.  I had hopes but left disappointed. The Pinot Grigio was buttery and delicious though.",

Ordered Pizza land it was burnt with no taste, no cheese, watery sause, very sparse pepperoini. Frankly, Domino's or Pizza Hut would have beat this junk. This pizza was a joke. Don't believe everything you read on yelp. My mom said, Somebody got bribed at Yelp. All I can say is \"never again\". Keep in mind, I am from Chicago, so i do know good pizza pies!",

She definitely kept us entertained and had something to talk about while I had my Gnocchi which was delicious!! Everything about this place is good.

I also loved the way it was decorated and of course the big pizza oven! :)   We started with the Bruschetta Classica, and that was delicious. The tomatoes were fresh and the olive oil tasted amazing with the bread. I loved how it was a little salty, but not too much. I think it's a really good deal for the price, too!   For dinner we split the Margarita pizza and Strozzapreti Salsiccia. The pasta was amazing; I loved the sauce and the noodles it's made with, and the sausage was really yummy. The Margarita pizza was very good too, though not the best I've had. I think it could have used a lot more mozzarella, as ours didn't have very much (I noticed the people at the table next to us each got a Margarita pizza and theirs had a lot more cheese!). We split each of these between two people, and it was filling but not so much we had leftovers - not quite the huge portions a lot of pasta dishes come with!   Then, we got the tiramisu for dessert, which we both loved. It was chocolatey and fluffy, and super creamy. So good!! It also looked really pretty the way they served it to us. My boyfriend also got an espresso - not my thing but he seemed to like it lol. I'm ready to come back here anytime!",

Our first night we started out with appetizers-the polpette meatballs-creekstone natural beef, pork, tomato sauce and parmigiano and the arincini Sicilian-saffron rice balls filled with meat sauce, mozzarella and sweet peas. Yum! We split the Kale-Romana organic salad with shaved parmigiano, homemade croutons, and the house dressing. Then we split 3 entrees among the 3 of us-the strozzapreti salsiccia-an incredible pasta with Italian sausage, tomato sauce, cream, rosemary and parmigiano cheese, the lasagna al forno with Bolognese meat sauce, besciamel and parmigiano, and the Spaccatelle Carbonara-pasta with pancetta, cream, organic egg yolk pecorino Romano. Everything was over the top delicious. Their pasta is hand crafted in-house daily with imported Italian semolina flour. They also have gluten free pasta available-brown rice pasta.  They have pizzas too and even offer gluten free pizzas.  Our last night in town we got our order to go.  Everyone there was super friendly and attentive. Great atmosphere. We even got a gift card for our friends that come to Scottsdale often. Our favorite place to eat on our trip!",

I put pizza into maps and looked to see what was in the area.  Pomo wasn't too far, so we decided to try it.  Turned out to be a great choice.  I had the Parmigiana pizza, which is one of their thinner crust options.  Every part of it was delicious - the crust, the sauce, the eggplant, but those peppers were HOT!  I never should have eaten one by itself.  On the pizza, fantastic.  But on their own - felt like I licked fire, or what I would imagine licking fire would feel like since I've never actually done that.  We each brought half of our pizzas home because that's just what we do - each order our own, eat half and bring the rest home for later. Service was very good, but prices were a little on the higher side IMO - $16 per pizza.  Overall, very good and I'm sure we'll be back.",

We especially like the strozzapreti and the carbonara. Salads are good, and the pizza is all fantastic. Save room for dessert here! The panna cotta, torta nutella, and profitterol are all yummy. They have added gelato, and it is absolutely delicious. We have never had anyone leave there with a less than stellar review. In fact, my friends that just visited for a three day weekend insisted on going back for more gelato before they had to leave and go back home.",

Most of the staff (including the manager) made us feel like we were inconveniencing them. Fortunately though, everything changed when our server Ben came by to greet us. He is so friendly (and from a fellow server very good at what he does) he made us feel like our money was well spent. Even though he was very busy he took the time to go over the wine list with us and gave us a wonderful recommendation! The food here is great and truly exceeded our expectations for pizza and bruschetta. We have been here a few times before and our servers have been good but Ben makes you want to take time out of your night to acknowledge your experience. Thank you Ben!",

Our waiter either was fresh off the boat or was a great actor with his accent telling us \"Bonappetit\" Too bad the guy cooking pizza was a local guy with tats, so maybe the tatted up Scottsdale guy should switch places with the accented waiter and we might have had a better pizza and meal. This place is open until 11pm, so that is why we ended up here for a late dinner.    Started off with an unusual version of \"rice Balls\" They use saffron rice in the Arrancita and charge about 10 bucks for two balls. A bit too greasy and they fell apart too easy and lacked much flavor, but the accompanying sauce helped a tad. The pepino pizza was a fancy wood oven mess. This is where the real Italian might have helped, but I think all of this place's pizza's come out undercooked on the bottom and mostly cooked on the surface. The crust was soft and edible, but the rest of the pie really came straight out of Compton, not Italy. Arriverderchi Pomo.",

However, they were crowded and I had remembered seeing Pomo on a Yelp search and seeing that they had great reviews. Therefore, we decided to walk across the parking lot for some pizza instead for lunch.  We were seated right away and since it was our first time there, we were told about their background and how they're the only place in the US that's certified for having authentic Napoleon style pizza (or something like that). We ordered the margharita pizza and gnocci. We were warned that the wait would be a little longer due to the gnocci.  The wait was definitely long, but worth it. The pizza was great. Lots of flavor with fresh ingredients. The gnocci was room temperature when we got it which was disappointing. It was really good though, just would have been better if it was hot. It did make for great leftovers though.   I'm sure I'll be back!",

    "text": "After seeing SOI 4 (Thai place in the same complex) was nearly empty at 8pm on a Friday night (never a good sign), my boyfriend and I stumbled upon Pomo Pizzeria. This was the best \"stumble upon\" I've had in a long time!   We sat outside at the bar, which made for great people watching. The three bartenders were all very friendly, but Shelly really stood out, taking the time to learn and remember our names. She offered her recommendations and since we'd never been there before, we took them! We started with the meatball appetizer. The flavor of the meatballs and sauce were great, although the meatballs weren't very hot. Another minute or two on the heat would have been great.   For our entrees, we decided to split a pizza and a pasta. Great decision! For the pizza we selected the Principe: prosciutto, arugula, and parmesan. EXCELLENT.  I can't recall the name of the pasta dish we had, but it was homemade pasta with sausage and rosemary in a tomato cream sauce. SO GOOD. A bit on the salty side (and I love salt) but not offensive. I imagine if some one isn't big on salt they wouldn't like it, though. The pasta was perfectly cooked and had a great bite to it.   Shelly, knowing it was our first time there, surprised us with dessert: the most amazing panna cotta I have ever had. Creamy, not overly sweet, and the perfect amount of vanilla. YUM.   We love trying new restaurants and with so many in Scottsdale it's easy not to go to the same place twice. However, we had such a great meal here that will will absolutely put this into regular rotation!",

I thought the bruschetta was good, but I feel it needed a little more umph. Perhaps the pizza and pasta is different? Aside from the eats, mood is romantic and light hearted, the staff is attentive and deserve 5 stars.",

It is difficult to find fair much less good gluten free pizza.  Alas, I was disappointed as the margherita pizza was nearly inedible.  The crust was ok, so perhaps these pizzas need to cooked a little longer than their standard pizzas. Even the restaurant could not cut it into slices since they were all partially attached.  If you can't offer a better meal than this, then don't.  Unfortunately, other than salads and appetizers , there is not much else for those of us who need gluten free to eat.  So the gluten free option is really not available.  Everyone else in our party seemed to be pleased except for my wife who told me never to ask her to share a gluten free pizza with her again.",

I'm so happy we opted for the bar as we had the most pleasant bartender, Noah.  He was very helpful with our wine selection. We weren't sure what we wanted.  After asking our likes and dislikes, he offered a tasting of 3 different types.  We selected the Montepulciano which was perfect.  We had decided to split a salad and a pizza.  Again, not sure which ones we would like, Noah gave us very good descriptions of each and we chose the Bufala pizza.  It turned out to be a perfect night with great food and wine, and a perfect service.",

We walked in and were greeted warmly by the hostess told her we were two for dinner and she said just wait one minute . Brad a new recruit who had literally started that day showed us to our table. The place was very lively with many families and couples enjoying each other's company and the delicious foods that were delivered to their tables by the extremely well trained and efficient staff. The waitstaff work like a well oiled machine and flited about the room with smiles, the open kitchen environment that housed the wood burning oven put on an awesome show.  Our waitresses name was Tara she was fabulous and treated us as if we were the only table she had explaining the menu to us with patience and expertly answered all of our questions. She is a student and has been working there for four years.. She is a definite asset to your team!  We are on vacation in Arizona for the first time and really were searching for a great authentic place to have pizza and Italian fare. This place is definitely worth a repeat visit when we return Excellent food and service!",

The greeter sat us at stable for two next the door, which seemed perfectly lovely until servers began to utilize the door. It was constant slamming, as the door had no stopper. We asked if we could move as it felt like the glass window might shatter on us at any moment. They happily moved us in doors. You could still hear the constant slamming of the door but the possibility of shattered  glass was no longer a concern. We ordered the trio bruschetta to start. Although the presentation was lovely the dish lacked flavor. Then we had the kale and Roma salad which again was bland and had no flavor. Finally we ended the experience with a white pizza with sausage and mushroom, which sadly had very little flavor. Also the mushrooms appeared to be canned mushrooms and we're not fresh or high quality. The only saving grace of his experience was the wine. I would not recommend this establishment.",

    "text": "Arrived for dinner with my family around 7pm, greeted by 3 girls at the hostess desk that seemed to be caught off guard asking for a table. They said that they could only seat us outside or we could move next door to the other restaurant that served the same menu. We chose the other restaurant which is advertised as the \"Mozzarella bar.\" My wife, daughter and I proceed to head out the door only to wonder around trying to look for this \"mozzarella bar\". We then realize that it is housed in the same restaurant, just blocked off by a partition. The 3 girls really did a poor job of directing us just 10 feet to the other area. All 3 watched us walk out the front door. After the confusion we where seated in an area that seemed to be more of a casual area. We where greeted by a waiter who seemed to be in slow mode & put out the entire time he had to serve us. We were is only table. He mentioned several times that he typically worked the other room and was a little unfamiliar with the menu. This made me think he was in the \"time out room\" and being punished for the poor service maybe he provide 10 feet away on the other side. Now this is just my speculation. Ordered from the mozzarella menu. $10 for a large ball of what seemed like homemade mozzarella. Now mind you he did not even explain the menu at all or how items are prepared. Nothing to sell the restaurant or what they are known for. Entire meal service was poor at best. He stood the entire time behind the counter and kept playing with the high end meat slicer turning the wheel. Other waiters seemed to be hurrying around to provide top notch service. Dinner arrived and we ordered 2 pizza's and one pasta dish. The food is pretty good here. Pizza served individual size really is plenty for 2 people to share. Again it would have been nice had our waiter told us that. My daughter and wife both packed each of their pizza up as they could only finish half at most. My bowl of tagliatelle  Bolognese was very good bowl of homemade pasta. Well worth the $16 bucks. The food is beyond decent but not knock your socks off. The service for lack of a better word... sucked. I would probably would come back to dine on the other side of the restaurant and see if the service improved. 2 ice teas, 2 apps, 2 pizza and 1 bowl of pasta ran $83. I would say a little on the higher end.",

My husband and I shared the lasagne al forno (again - one of the best I've ever had) and the bufala verace pizza. The pizza was good but I would try a different one next time we go.  We finished it off with a chocolate mousse (OMG!).  The food was amazing and our waiter gave us exceptional service. The atmosphere is simple but very appealing and modern.

Forgot our wine order, served wrong pizza and this on top of a 20 minute wait for a table, when there were nothing but open tables!!  Third visit (yes, I kept trying), seems like a whole new staff but same service.  Trainees are hardly given a chance, and a whole new crop seems to pop up without anything improving.  Overall, I'd say, bring lots of patience & your appetite because both will be tested.  Too bad management doesn't know how to manage.  Patience, persistence & positiveness breeds top notch servers and employees.",

Then our waitress told us that the tables were reserved and the people who reserved it were here so we had to move. It was really weird. I worked in the restaurant/hospitality business for years and I would have expected a manager to come over and apologize and tell us that it was their fault that there was no reserved tag on the table but it put us and the waitress in an awkward position. The restaurant was full so we had to wait until 2 chairs opened next to each other. A customer offered to move so my friend and I could sit next to each other and we ended up buying him a drink.

I always request to be seated in Alex's section because he's a great server and a really nice guy.  I usually start with the bruschetta sorrentina; comes with two pieces so it's good for two people!  The pizza I usually stick with is the Toto Sapore which is an all meat pizza. The crust is nice and thin in the middle and a little thicker towards the edge and the crust itself tastes amazing!  I always end with a tiramisu. I love Italian food and I've had a lot of tiramisu's in my life and Pomo's tiramisu is, by far, the best I have ever had! I can't describe how good it it is, it's just something you have to try for yourself!

Rather than interrupt I decided to see how long they would leave a customer standing there before noticing. They won - after waiting for 2 full minutes with neither one of them lifting their gaze from the table map I said excuse me - the manger raised his finger as if to ask me to wait. I returned to my table, gathered my party and we walked out. again no one looked up.  If there is one thing that drives me crazy it's these places that get all self-important.

    "text": "My husband and I just celebrated our 5yr anniversary at Pomo last night. This was our first time to the restaurant and we had a great experience! We ordered the Affettati Misti, crocchete pugliesi, and the Romana salad for starters. Then we ordered the Regina Margherita and the Toto Sapore pizza. Everything was delicious and beautifully presented. We were given excellent service by everyone except our own server. She must have been new or had too many tables to look after. We had many other servers coming by to look after us, so it turned out fine. To end our night we stepped over to the sister store that is an Italian market. We were greeted by John and enjoyed an engaging and educating conversation about the \"family\" farm in Italy where they grow and harvest the olives. It was very fascinating to learn about the process of making olive oils. We ordered the Semifreddo for dessert and I wish I could have taken some home for later :) I'm looking forward to going back to Pomo soon!",

The one thing I do like is the ambiance. Great little bar, nice patio, good service, but the food just isn't something to rave about which is too bad. Just so you have a comparison, the pizza places I like in town is Slice of Sicily, Pizzaria Bianco, and Crust.",

Pizza's were bland and burnt on the bottom.  Pasta was ok but the veges needed to be seen through a microscope.  The meat plate was OK but far frome exciting. The cream sauce was very bland. Tiramasu was very good.  The child's pizza was bad and they would not take it off the bill.  Also billing errors needed to be fixed.  All in all Id rather go to Grazie ( better wine list), Il Bosco, of course Federal Pizza (awesome but its a Postino restaurant) and Grimaldis and the  Parlor.",

The old folks near us were throwing a fit that they did not get their regular table so everyone was trying to appease them and forgot that there were other patrons there.  We got up and got a drink at the bar saying no one had waited on us and asked for a menu.....still  no one came by. 10 minutes later we again asked for a server and finally got a young thing with an attitude. The pizza a salad were adequate but pricey and although it was a thin crust is wasn't quite done. Not sure if we will give it another try.",

Downside is the service was horrible. They forgot our appetizer first and it came out after everyone else in the party had already finished their starter. Then it happened again with one of the pizzas and we ended up having to take it to go. The waitress was apologetic but told us she wasn't aloud to talk to the kitchen to tell them to cancel it since we were finished with all the food. The food that we did get was good as always, which is why I'm still giving 3 stars. Since service was the only thing really horrible (assuming the mistakes were the waitress not the kitchen), I will go back to try again at the new location.",

I find it's a special night when we go there. They have a great outside covered patio as well as a very nice inside area to eat. Many of the ingredients are brought in from Italy. I think this is an adult place, but kids are welcomed. Parking is great. One person named Cricket stands out in my mind, as she is over seeing the wait staff and she makes sure everyone is enjoying their meals. The pizza is on the wet side, so be aware of what you are ordering. We also usually split a salad, as they are large and very good. I also think this place would be a good place to take a date, as it's a cut above the rest.",

I also highly recommend the simply prepared, yet delicious faro salad, especially as an appetizer to share. I'm yet to learn where they get their tomatoes from. They're more flavorful than any tomatoes I've tried here. The desserts are equally impressive. My favorite right now is the semifreddo. Also great selection of Italian wines. Very reasonably priced and very consistent. I've never walked out disappointed. I'm get to try their pastas. I'm sure they're equally delicious. They also have a very nice bar area and I love that instead of sports on their TV screen, you see Italian landscapes. Always makes me want to go back to Italy. The little marketplace is also lovely and you can purchase many of the items on the menu. The place is always very busy on weekends, so you may need reservations or opt for a spot at the bar.",

I was pleasantly surprised!!     It's situated in a fancier strip mall, but a strip mall nonetheless.  (man does the valley love a mall). don't be deterred.    With indoor dining and a large gorgeous patio, there is ample seating. I recommend reservations as it was packed on a Friday night.  However we had a lovely time chatting in the attached market/mozzarella bar. We learned that they import Italian foods and beverages  and most of the ingredients as well. Sure enough I saw tons of drinks, canned cherry tomatoes (the BEST), cheeses, cookies, you name it.    The service was excellent and attentive.  Our server really pared down the extensive menu for us and offered great suggestions.    The wine list is 100% Italian wines, of course, and offers a variety of wines in varying price points.   We opted for a pizza.  Absolutely delicious.  We ordered the pizza with fresh shaved parm, prosciutto, and arugula. While the arugula on top made it hard to pick up and eat, it was outstanding nonetheless. I was informed that the pizza oven was shipped from Italy as well.  It tasted like it did in Naples to me!!  We also split the bufalita salad.  ARgula, cherry tomatoes, olive oil, and fresh bufalata.  simple, yet delicious.   I cannot wait to go back and visit this restaurant again.",

I've been here a handful of times - my favorite salad is the Pollo - an organic spring mix with avocado, organic grilled chicken, pine nuts, grape tomatoes, and vinaigrette.   I usually get the salad or a pizza - my favorite (so far) is the Principe - this is one of their classic pizzas that has prosciutto, arugula, and shaved parmesan cheese. I've heard the panini's are great too - they're huge! You won't leave hungry.   If you visit on a weekend night, make a reservation or be prepared for a long wait!",

I ordered the Principe - Prosciutto Crudo San Daniele DOP, Fresh Arugula Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano and it was insanely good! The not so good was their Siciliana Salad which featured Sicilian Tuna, Organic Spring Mix, Grape Tomato Cherry Mozzarella, Evoo. It really lacked any real flavor and for $12.00 not worth ordering. Drink menu here is great - they have their own version of a Moscow Mule, which frankly I enjoy more than the traditional mule.  It's a great addition to the neighborhood but I wish the service was better!",

In fact, even for average food, its average.  The big problem here is the flavor profiles, which are nearly non-existent.  Neither the pizza nor the pasta tasted like much of anything, and the pasta was overly glutenous.  The panna cotta for dessert had the consistency of rubber, but at least it did have flavor.  We didn't hate the food, but we certainly didn't love it.  I left feeling like \"why did I waste my time, money, and calories?\".",

I HIGHLY suggest making a reservation ahead of time, they are very busy in Scottsdale during the weekends. We were seated outside and thankfully the patio was enclosed and had plenty of heat lamps and overhead heaters but wasn't too stuffy. We ordered a round of drinks, and some of the best cocktails and coldest beers ever! For an appetizer we ordered the bruschetta trio and to be honest I was a tiny bit let down with how bland the trio was. None of the options included any type of meat, and the tomato one was literally just chopped up tomatoes on bread, no olive oil or even balsamic vinaigrette. I actually had to ask for a side of balsamic to add just a little more flavor. But the avocado one was the best one!  For our main meal we shared the margarita pizza and omg was it amazing! Thin crust with a fluffy crispy rim crust and the mozzarella was fresh with basil! One pizza was plenty for two of us!  The overall atmosphere is intimate, dark, and overall a great place to enjoy some amazing authentic Italian food. The best part is the gelato Luna is attached so after dinner you can literally walk over for dessert!",

That's high praise when you have Pizzeria Bianco contending and NYPD making a damned good facsimile of New York style.  One of the only restaurants in the country that is certified by the City of Naples, they pull of the impressive feat of having a thin crust pizza that doesn't get soggy but retains both crispiness and a bit of doughiness from first slice to last. The fresh mozerella is incredible, and the spicy olive oil soaks into the crust and gives the pizza a great kick (add at your discretion).   I also rave about the mushroom bisque soup. It is bursting with flavor, and is a really thick soup. They deliver it with a side of freshly toasted bread, so be ready to carbo-load at Pomo... its totally worth it.   I also personally enjoy that they have Peroni on tap. The wait staff is always very nice, and really engaging whenever I have brought my kids. To get an authentic  Italian-pizza style experience, Pomo just can't be beat.",

Maybe an off night, but this second disappointing experience compels me to update a prior review.  The pizza crust was great, but quality of the toppings (mushrooms in this case) was lackluster.  The Pasta Carbonara: starting off, the portion was the size of a small person's fist, at best. Then, the pasta was rubbery (not al dente); egg component was lumpy; pancetta (although technically the original recipe calls foe guanciale) maybe there were six to seven small pieces. Flavor was lacking. Just. Not. Good.  To top it off, while our server was cordial and mostly timely, at *no* point did she ask how our dishes or overall meal was. Not once.  So, I'll likely not be back for some time.",

Very professional, helpful, and friendly.  Since we were there during happy hour, we decided to try a few things on the HH menu.  We ordered the calamari, the mozzarella fritta, and the panzerotti.  I had the well whiskey martini.   Didn't care for the well whiskey; therefore, had the angel's envy martini.   That's what I'd call a decent whiskey.   Very smooth.  I also ordered the minestrone.  The minestrone, was, well, minestrone.   Nothing that made it stand out.   As far as the calamari and the two other fried appetizers, I must admit, I wouldn't order them again.   I felt the calamari was bland, and the other two over-fried and heavy.  They came with marinara sauce, which I don't care for, so I asked for other items in which to dip the food and cut the grease.  Tony graciously and immediately ran over to the kitchen and came back with two more dips, one which was a sort of creamy dip (I don't know what it was -- something like ranch dressing) and something else.   I liked the \"ranch dressing\" dip.  Perhaps I will try it for dinner.   I know I wouldn't go for the HH food.   The Angel's Envy martini was good.",

Star 1: How were the service and atmosphere?  Pomo Pizzeria has some serious real estate, but they make good use of it with abundant and varied seating and a full bar. My server couldn't have been nicer, and the pies come out quick. Star.   Star 2: How were the portions relative to the cost?  The pies at at Pomo range between $15.00 and $19.00, and for that you get a pizza that could comfortably feed two for lunch. Those are reasonable prices, and I opted for the below:  Diavola: $14.95 Ortolana: $15.95 Quattro Formaggi: $14.95   Stars 3 and 4: How was the food?  The diavola was without a doubt the standout pizza from Pomo, and while the crust was a bit on the soggy side in the middle as others have mentioned, the toppings carried the day.   Having said that, the Ortolana disappointed a little bit, and the Quattro Formaggi had a very odd flavor profile that I didn't love. Single Star.   Star 5: Would you eat here every day if you could?  Pomo Pizzeria is worth your visit, but I've simply had pizzas elsewhere with better crusts and toppings. No Star.",

The outdoor seating area is on the parking lot side, and has lots of shade, and there's not too much noise from nearby Scottsdale Road.  First, the good: +The service was pleasant without being overbearing. Drink refills were offered without us having to ask. +There were plenty of places to sit which did not force me to look at a television screen (my own peckadillo - I HATE TV screens while eating!) +The lunch special Capellini Pomodoro was delicious. The pasta was just a BIT overcooked, but not too much. A generous portion which my wife and I shared. The sauce was just great.  For the less good: - Mom got the crispy crust \"pizza rimini\" - the salsiccia funghi (sausage and mushrooms. Yes, the edges were crispy, but the bottom was decidedly NOT crispy - it was limp and seemed undercooked. There were only small smatterings of mozzarella and tomato sauce. But it did taste good. -The chairs for the outside seating were VERY uncomfortable. They are all metal - no cushions - kind of \"bucket seats\" in that they are rounded up at the edges and back. They aren't wide enough for even my (modest) rear end, and if you happen to want to lean back, you'll find your rear end sliding forward out of the chair.  -The price was a bit on the steep side. The appetizer \"Arancini Siciliani\" (3 rice balls filled with sauce, cheese, and sweat peas) was $11 - and it wasn't that great. The pizza (which was wasn't big - about 12\") was $17. The three soft drinks were each $4. As I said, my wife and I shared a lunch special Capellini al Pomodoro, which was reasonable because we shared it and it was only $14. With tax and tip, about $70 - a bit steep for a lunch in which two of us shared a main dish.  Overall, the meal was good, but not great.  So, I'm glad we went, but we won't be going back.",

    "text": "I had a FABULOUS exsperience at Pomo. You walk in and it's so airy, modern and beautiful. I partially liked the wall with the potted fresh herbs growing. Pomo serves certified Neapolitan Pizzas among many other Italian dishes like pastas and rice balls.  Our server was extremely welcoming and very knowledgeable about the menu and in Italian food in general.  I decided to order one of the seasonal special pizzas called the Stracchino and Rucola because I never had Stracchino Cheese before. I soon receive the pizza and everything thing about it was perfect. A nicely prepared crust with good structure and chewiness, the sweetest charred cherry tomatoes, peppery fresh arugula, and that very special melty, creamy more flavorful than mozzarella cheese with the perfect touch of Extra Virgin Olive Oil. It was a delicious pizza and I'm glad I ordered it.  This really was a 5 star exsperience.   Due to I go out to eat often and have been to many places I've come to the conclusion that pizza places can't be five stars because pizza making is part science and also mostly INTUITION you vary the recipe on the the humidity and the life in the yeast. I've been to Pizzeria Bianco and La Piazza al Forno a number of times and I can tell you they aren't consistent so I don't expect that Pomo can be consistent either.  If I have three consecutive perfect pizzas from Pomo I will change my rating to 5 stars.  4.5 stars",

I got the meat lovers pizza (they had a fancy Italian name for it). The toppings were good but overall I'd have to say it was just ok. My friend's pizza was the same way. They should have left it in a little longer!  You just don't expect a pie from a 900 degree brick oven to not be crispy, this was closer to doughy. All in all, pretty store, average pizza. I'd rather go to Pizza A Metro whose building is less than desirable but has excellent pizza. That's just me.",

First, let me start by saying that I'm originally from NY, and love/need/thrive on good pizza.   The drinks and house wine is pretty decent for happy hour. I forget the price but I had the house Chianti, mostly always a decent choice when at an italian joint, in my opinion.  I started with the HH meatballs, large in size, i really really liked the sauce.  Very good sauce. The meatballs themselves were pretty average tasting.  True italian meatballs have a blend of veal, pork, and beef.  I get frustrated when restuarunts skip the veal or go cheap on it-- its obvious and annoying.    I ordered the personal margarita pizza, and was pleasantly surprised.  However, its a pretty easy dish and should be considered a no-brainer.   With all the other offerings around Scottsdale, I'm just in no hurry to go back.  I was provided perfect service, great ambience and decent food at a reasonable price.  If Pomo can kick up its food game, then this place will be 4 stars.",

Our waiter was great when we first ordered but also did not write down our order. When the order arrived it was not correct, I let him know and was told that I had made the mistake, not him.  He was angry and rude while telling me that even though I made the mistake, he would \"buy\" it for me.  It took over an hour for our pasta dish to arrive after asking him about it, which he had obviously never put in.  I was considering talking to a manager because it was not only embarrassing but disappointing  and as a business owner myself, I would want to know.  Unfortunately who ever was in charge was too busy screaming at a cook and throwing a utensil.  Very disappointing.",

It was flavorful and the pasta was cooked beautifully. Over cooked pasta is unforgivable, in my book. Our pizza needed another 3-4 minutes cooking to make the crust less soggy and to avoid the cold middle we experienced. The flavor was good, for sure. It just could have been executed better. I will say that we did not have reservations so the hostess was going to either seat us outside or at the pizza bar and the manager (I'm guessing) found a table for us in the dining room. With our three year old, I especially appreciated the extra effort. We would eat here again.",

    "text": "My wife and I were visiting our daughter in the Scottsdale area.  We are from California and our daughter recommended dining at Pomo. We ordered a Margarita pizza to go and went back to our resort.  When we opened the box we were surprised to see sausage and dollop of ricotta cheese, not what we traditionally expect from a margarita pizza.  The pizza was fair, primarily because it wasn't what we expected.  We returned the following night to give it another try.  We advised the staff of our surprise with our precious's nights order.  To their credit they said we likely got the wrong pizza and notified the manager, Alex, who also believe we received the wrong order. Alex comped our order and this time the Margarita pizza was as expected and was delicious.    So based on the quality of food and the professionalism of the staff (especially Manager Alex, I give Pomo a high review!",

We ordered the focaccia di recco and that was off. I remember last year the cheese was silky and the crust was flaky but this time the cheese was powdery and the crust soggy. The creme brulee was old. It was not fresh. It was clearly days old. I've never had to send food back, but it the Creme brulee was so off I had to return it.   It's unfortunate Pomo dropped in quality so much. I hope they take this review seriously and improve their products.",

We waited about 10 minutes for a table and were seated inside by the patio. Decided to go with a classic and ordered the margherita and the rucola salad, which was brought out first. The salads are a good variety; mine had arugula, strawberries, candies walnuts, and Gorgonzola cheese. The flavors were strong and seemed to complement each other, along with the lemon vinaigrette. The pizza was pretty disappointing. I get that Neapolitan style is thin and baked in a large oven, but there was hardly any basil topping and the consistency was flimsy and flavorless. I did like the charred bottom but otherwise not a fan. I almost wanted to ask for ranch dressing to eat with my crusts but know I'd be ridiculed for it.   Great atmosphere and location. Our servers were very friendly and efficient, waters consistently topped off and plates cleared. Love that the gelateria is in the same building and we enjoyed that afterwards.",

You'll leave completely satisfied, and happy to support such a fine restaurant!   A little note on my experience, we came with a party of 4, and one sweet Goldendoodle. Unfortunately I didn't call or look ahead to see if they had a dog friendly patio, and we were turned away, due to them not having a dog friendly patio. As we were walking away, the manager came out, and asked if we didn't mind sitting in the \"Luna gelato\" patio? Dogs are allowed there! It was fine with us! We were seated, and my Luna was happy sitting in a place that shared her sweet name!   We ordered the calamari, and  caprese salad for our starters, both were fantastic! Our entrees; 2 margarita pizzas, gnocchi, and a meaty pizza! Everything was so tasty, and executed perfectly!   We were treated so well by our server, who could of been the owner, an Italian man, who was so friendly with Luna! Gave her vanilla gelato, and lots of love!  Made our day!   We've all been to Pomo on many different occasions, and it never ever disappoints! So authentic and perfect in every way!",

Usually bustling with the corporate suits and the entourage of beauties, it's perfect for lunch meetings and casual happy hour. I'm sure dinner is as great as the aforementioned times.   Pizza selection caters to the meat lovers and vegan friends. Loved the appetizer meatballs, not dry with such a flavorful sauce for dipping bread. Pasta tastes fresh as if an Italian grandma made it for you. Happy hour is pretty decent with several cocktails and house wines. I have to say their True stars lie in the dessert choices. Have you not seen my pictures of the panna cotta, cannoli, gelato, and whatever creamy goodness is available??!!! Like most things, it is really a matter of taste since I cannot speak on the authenticity of its Italian likeness. It certainly beats me slaving over a hot pizza oven! Service is good and quick, the food consistent which is why I believe it's a solid 3-Star. Forego the pizza delivery once in awhile and come enjoy homemade food.",

    "text": "Honestly, there isn't much to say about Pomo that others haven't already said.   Although we typically frequent the Downtown location, their Scottsdale spot is a bit bigger and usually more crowded. However, what makes this particular Pomo location unique is that it offers one item that the others do not:  Their special Focaccia Di Recco.  Oh, I'm sure you've had Focaccia many times, but not like this. It comes with stracchio cheese baked in, making it more flavorful, moist, and fabulous. You have the option to add local honey, but I feel that it's not really necessary. And if so, use it sparingly.  Pastas and pizzas are all on-point and consistent with what we've come to expect at their other locations. This is True Neapolitan pizza, meaning that it adheres to very strict guidelines. You'll only find traditional pie styles here, which may turn off those who prefer their BBQ chicken or pineapple.   Yes, people. It's supposed to be soggy in the middle. And yes, as annoying as it is, there's at least a 50% chance that when pulling a slice, the toppings might slip off. That's fairly common at pretty much all places that serve this style of pizza, but it definitely doesn't detract from the flavor or the quality of the ingredients used. Crust is slightly charred and filled with flavor.   Although I still prefer their Downtown location (even if some of the tiny charms have been stripped away more recently - another story entirely), I really feel that Pomo has consistently offered up one of the better pizza options throughout the entire area.  Get the focaccia, split your dinner with a homemade pasta and pizza and you'll leave very pleased.  Great stuff!",

Our group had the Carbonera, the pesto Campanella, the salmon with squid ink pasta which everyone agreed was the best, the pasta Arriabata and pomodoro pasta. My 97 year old mother said it was the best marinara ever! And that's saying something from someone who spent 70 years making her own marinara!  The meal was completed w a trip to the other side of the restaurant for delicious gelato and sherbert. My mother's birthday was the occasion and they gave her a large piece of chocolate mousse cake with vanilla gelato which was big enough to share with us.  The service was impeccable as Blake was attentive yet unobtrusive and took time to explain all the dishes  We had a bottle of Classico Chianti which was admirable and went well with all dishes My only negative was that we paid for a plate of bread with ten or so olives and oil which we all felt should have been gratis",

We shared the \"frito misto\" of PERFECTLY battered and fried calamari and delicate shrimp, perfect carpaccio AND their signature appetizer, the ? Recco? (I'd have to look at the menu) which is this super thin crust with funky cheese that you drizzle HONEY on. SERIOUSLY interesting and delicious.  2 pizzas - one regular and one very thin (not crispy though but still delicious) - a multi-meat pizza and the porcini mushroom. Delicate and flavorful. Our table of four was happy. AND you can't leave without their freshly made gelatos. My SUPER FAVORITE is their little baby cone, filled with warm chocolate and a tiny scooping of your flavor of choice. The Pistaccio is LEGIT. Great service with Jessica, great food, and great gelato! A TRIPLE HIT!",

They have pasta options too but my husband who got carbonara was jealous of my veggie pizza when he tasted it!   Both indoor and outdoor seating options (outside is covered so not too sunny)!!  Within walking distance to Sonesta hotel.  Best part, shares a dining room with Luna gelato!!! YUM!",

    "text": "We had hoped to go to Pomo before the Scottsdale Train Park, so I called the restaurant and asked if we would have a problem getting a seat around 5:45. The hostess said they don't get busy until 7 and that we should have no problem getting a table for two adults and one child. We arrived right at 5:45 and were told that the only tables that were available were outside. (It was 55 degrees outside at the time and we have a toddler with us) I was pissed, but we went with it. We ordered all of our food at once and after 20 minutes of nothing but drinks, I asked for some bread. Keep in mind that I now have a hungry and cold toddler to deal with. The busser told me that bread was a menu item and that I had to order it from the server. Really? Ok... now I was really pissed. The salad was mediocre at best (greens, cucumbers and some unripe tomatoes). Despite the fact that the pizzas were \"certified\" as being authentic Napoleon pizzas, they were way over rated IMHO. Service became very slow towards the end of our visit. So slow that I had to get up and find a staff member to ask our server for a box and a check. To add insult to injury, two 12 inch pizzas, a craptastic salad and two glasses of wine were $72.00. Grimaldi's and Pizzaria Bianco are a thousand times better than this place. My recommendation... don't waste your money or your time on Pomo.",

The inside is the same as the other restaurant, casual with a huge photograph of a street in Italy that takes up the entire wall. Now I am fussy about Pizza and nothing on the menus really struck me. I love good italian sausage and pepperoni and they did not have pepperoni, I decided on the Homemade Tomato soup and Bruchetta . All I can say is that it lacked flavor. The tomato soup was bland and when I added salt and pepper it did not change the flavor much. Not what I expected. The Bruchetta was bland also. While Arizona tomatoes are bland, the only thing I tasted was garlic. No other spices which could zip up this dish. friends had the Chicken salad. My friend said the lemon dressing was bland. She got a different dressing but said it was nothing special. My husband had pasta marinara and my husband said it was good, bold flavor but not enough sauce. Our other friend had a pizza with peppers, sausage and mushrooms and he said it was ok. I think I will try another Italian restaurant, Phoenix does not have many outstanding Italian restaurants or bakeries.",

The only table that was immediately available was outside and with it being 6:00 and 100 degrees we decided to wait the estimated wait time of 45 to 60 minutes. After over an hour and fifteen minute wait and multiple requests for a estimated time that our table would be ready we were approached with a table that was ready. Okay finally right? No, the table was ready but it was indeed outside. WTF? We were just sitting outside at the fire pits drinking from their bar waiting for that table inside. Our first reaction of course was are you kidding me? We could have been eating over an hour ago. They offered us free desert but explained the tables inside were all reserved for the night (Sunday night). We felt extremely taken advantage of while running up a bar tab that we of course were required to pay for, manager came out to apologize but it was indeed too late. Would not return even if the meal was paid for. Too many options in a beautiful city. I would not recommend this restaurant if you are a walk in, or looking for quality customer service.",

We stated we specifically asked for a table inside due to the heat, and were told that all tables inside were reserved for the night and only outside tables would be an option. This was obviously very disappointing, and we left hungry. I can't comment on the food, but the customer service, and manager need help. I will skip this place in the future.

I just wonder when it was they last tasted their own food to ensure the high quality as when they opened.  The gnocchi was not good.  We could not taste any potato in the dish; instead of delicate, light potato \"pillows\", they were mushy cheese balls.  I kept looking for the potato.  The minestrone soup was average. Gone was the lovely garlic and onion undertones of a well made minestrone.  The bruschetta was average--excellent bread, but the tomatoes on top were simply halved instead of diced, and the flavor was lacking.  There was one leaf of basil as a garnish on the plate, but no basil chopped up and added to the tomatoes.  The one shining light was the service.  We had a great waiter who couldn't have been more gracious and courteous.  Also, the coffee was exceptional.  Come on Pomo! Put the Mama Mia back in the food!",

I like this location much more than the previous Borgata version, and the delicious pizzas were something I knew I would miss when I moved away.    So...  Pomo was the first dinner spot I chose during my last trip back, and I was looking forward to some great pizza, wine and conversation.  3 people means we should share 3 pizzas, right?  Yes, there were left overs.  Some.  A little.    Principe:  This is by far my favorite.  Pomo's perfect thin crust graced with prosciutto crudo di parma, arugula, and shaved parmigiano reggiano.  I just cannot get enough.  Quattro Formaggi:  What is better than one cheese?  Four!  The fresh basil makes this creation even better.  Bufala Verace:  This is a classic Napoletana preparation, topped with delicious imported Mozzarella di Bufala Campana DOP, basil and EVOO.  I loved it as well, but wish there were even more of the mozzarella goodness.  A few days later, asked to select a lunch destination, I did not hesitate to suggest Pomo's outside patio.  This time between two people we shared the Principe (I said I can't get enough) as well as a Mista salad (the shaved parmigiano reggiano and balsamic vinegar topping the fresh greens earn this a spot in my heart).  Oh, and the nice chianti that rounded out the leisurely lunch didn't hurt either.  The location is great, and the layout with both indoor and covered patio seating makes it a good choice for an intimate meal or a get together with a larger group.  Can you open one in Orange County?  Please?  Just like you can expect summers in AZ to be hot, you can expect me to be back at Pomo as soon as possible.",

We always order the Kale Romana salad and the Diavola Pizza.  They're so good that it's hard to order anything else from the menu.  A side of the picante olive oil to eat your crust just puts the cherry on top.  You won't find another place like this.  Pomo is one of a kind and I'm glad they now have multiple locations throughout the valley.",

First off, this is a great restaurant options for large parties or even a first date. There are plenty of tables, a high ceilings, soft light - you'll never feel cramped yet it still keeps an intimate feel.  You can't go wrong with any of the pizzas - that high-flying dough is perfection and any variety of 'za will please the table. We went traditional with Regina Margherita and another, Bufala Verace. Mmmm. Gustoso!   Other table favorites were the meatballs, Crocchete Pulgliesi (potato croquettes), the wine - lots and lots of wine - and the owner! Owner Stefano Fabbri was an incredibly welcoming host - Italian through and through - who insisted we have more wine, food, dessert ... lots of character there.   Next visit to Scottsdale or Pheonix, I'll have to get another Pomo fix.",

From the floor to vaulted ceiling mural of an Italian street scene, to the living wall of herbs, and the bar area that is decked out with products for purchase to deck out your kitchen pantry - yup, Pomo is pretty amazing!   The food is lovely, and best shared with a group of friends or family. And speaking of family, if you are lucky enough to meet the fabulous owner, he will definitely make you feel like you are family.   Until I return to sunny Scottsdale, ciao bella Pomo!",

They have crayons and paper menus for the kids and a great kids menu. They get the kids' orders in right away which makes everyone happy. We keep going back because we absolutely love the pizzas. They are so delicious. We've had the salads too which are great, but really the pizzas steal the show. They are the perfect mix of crisp and doughy.

I had my birthday here again (previously at the Borgata location), and while we were a large group, the service from one of our 2 assigned waitstaff was frenetic.  When trying to find out how we were to be billed, she was essentially complaining and being extremely pushy about how hard it is to split checks and she needed to know NOW!  My pals eventually deferred to me, where I reiterated that we weren't all just going to \"throw credit cards in and split it\".  Gimme a break! I checked before booking to make sure it was still OK to split checks. You're getting your large group guaranteed tip, so chill the f out and stop yelling at my friends at my birthday dinner!  The food was great, and the service otherwise good.  At another recent visit, our service on the patio was pathetic.  With empty drinking glasses, I eventually turned it into self-service and took our empty glasses to be refilled at the bar.  That should NEVER happen. Ever.  Drink tip: their version of the mule is NOT good...ask for a regular Moscow mule or order a different drink!",

The pizza is ordinary. The place is very loud. It's crowded. Don't get me wrong, I lover Neapolitan pizza, and there is much better pizza around than this in Phoenix. About the pizza. They do pretty well with the crust, although it's probably a little short on salt. The sauce is bland, as is the sausage. Together that adds up to a pretty boring pizza. I will admit that if you get one with salami, it covers us the deficiency in the sauce. Anyway, this restaurant now falls into the category of 'I won't go there as a destination, but if I'm driving by and am starving, I may stop in.' That's not an elite group.",

The hostesses are friendly and NICE (yes you read that RIGHT....this is a rarity in Scottsdale, in my opinion). They are accommodating and down to earth.  Food: It's a good menu, good amount of salads and pizza and starters. We have pretty much almost sampled all the starters, Def tasty. My only comment would be that the grilled vegetables should look a little more 'robust'. But still delicious. The pizza is a hit. The minestrone is good too.  The desserts are the highlight, we have eaten through 80% of them.  The atmosphere is fun, casual. There always seem to be tables. I appreciate the fun fresh aspect of this place, and its a good change from the other 'italian' places that are so watered down. Definitely going again.",

I had the NAPOLI Pizza, very simple fresh local ingredients, sauce was perfect and the crust done just right, I would've given this pizza a perfect 5 BUT I'm an anchovy fan that's why I ordered this particular pie and I think there were maybe one fillet on each piece, they were very tasty just like the rest of the pie, just not enough so mine gets a 4, #2 son orders the POMO Pizza which I have to say was perfect, surprised he let me have a slice it was so good! #1 Son ordered TAGLIOLINI AL SALMONE, an Alaskan Salmon in  cream sauce with homemade pasta and it was awfully tasty, a well done dish with hints of saffron and lots of flavor. All in all a great evening out with my boys made even better by our lovely hostess and our great waiter Denny. Will definitely be back the next time in town. *****",

    "text": "After a bit of confusion about the location (google maps still lists only the old location although it notes that it is closed), we found our way to Pomo. The place was hopping! It had a wonderful outdoor area as well as tables inside. And the shiny silver tile-encrusted indoor pizza oven looks like it comes out of a science fiction movie, but it certainly puts out the pizza.   We started with salads - a Romano and a misto (field greens) salad which were both large enough to share. My recommendation would be for two people to share a salad or plan to share pizza or other main course.   All of us ordered pizzas which are thin crust and approximately 11-12 inches. I had the capricciosa which was excellent - prosciutto, olives, artichoke hearts and mushrooms. We all agreed that the pizzas were good albeit a bit soupy, maybe due to the fact that the 900+ degree pizza oven didn't allow them to be as crisp as other ovens.  They had a nice selection of Italian wines by the glass and service was excellent.",

Luckily, we found two spots at the outside portion of the bar and although a little warmer than inside, with the misters and fans it was not bad!  We split the Cesar salad and Principe pizza which were both great. They keep their menu simple by not over complicating their dishes with excessive ingredients. Instead, they use fresh a few fresh and high quality ingredients making it great authentic Italian food. I'm not a big fan of sausage or pepperoni on pizzas so the Principe was perfect, being prosciutto, arugula, and Parmesan with a red sauce base. The dough is a perfect balance, it's thin but not crispy, with a substantial crust, but not doughy.   Aside from the food, Pomo has a great open layout and a fun atmosphere. Very happy to have it open in my neighborhood. Will definitely be there again soon!",

The crust is perfect, it's thin/crispy/chewy all at the same time with the dark patches that absorb the wood smoke from the oven.  Toppings are balanced, not too much of anything that overwhelms the other ingredients.  I've tried the Amatricana - it was very good, the Margherita - it was excellent, Quattro Formaggi - ridicuously delicious.  The Emilia Focaccia is like their pizza, not what I expected but they warn you when you order and we loved it.  We've also tried the appetizer with the cured meat assortment, I only ate the cheese and bread but my husband assured me the meats were top quality and delicious.  The Mozzarella di Bufala appetizer is delicious too.  Gnocchi is clearly homemade and fresh, on the rare occasion I don't want pizza this will be my go to meal here.  My husband goes crazy for the pasta & fagioli, he orders a second portion just to take home and freeze  It's a nice mall complex with tons of parking and lots of other shops.  Small restaurant with all tables (one row has a long booth seat that faces a table and chairs).  They have an Italian market and mozzarella bar attached to the restaurant - haven't eaten anything from that side yet but the menu looks outrageous.",

    "text": "I have to admit, I am a bit perplexed at the low rating I have to give the food!  Pomo seems to have a great reputation and is really hyped as tops on the pizza circuit. I consider myself quite the pizza snob, so I can't describe how excited I was to finally try Pomo in Scottsdale.  The restaurant itself is nice and has a great vibe, and our server was terrific. However, I thought the pizza was incredibly subpar. You can be certified all you want with the APN and VPN, but if you serve me a personal pizza that tastes like a piece of burnt charcoal... for $17, well you know what you can do with that certificate.  and that was it... my pizza was awful. I ordered the Diavolo, and the basil was the only ingredient that I could taste. The spicy salami, was really just mini pepperonis, and any flavor they had were totally overpowered by the most pungent basil I have ever tasted on a pizza. The ingredients and flavor profiles were completely out of balance!  And on top of that, the crust had nothing but the burnt taste of the oven. Honest, it was awful. I couldn't believe it, I so wanted to love Pomo, based on what I saw (the oven, the pizza chef) and what I read.  My two dining partners enjoyed their pizzas, but they weren't overly impressed either. So maybe just mine got overcooked and burnt.... But at that price... there isn't much incentive to come try it again.  The one good thing: the tiramisu was top notch. We all really loved it, but sadly it didn't do much to quell my pizza sadness.  If I were to rank Pomo, it falls very short of Chris Bianco's, the Parlor, Grimaldi's, and Cibo. Heck, I'd rather go to Sal's in Tempe.  If INVITED back, I would more than gladly do a redo on my pizza and update this review. But otherwise, the $70 I spent there will be a memory and warning to not always believe the hype, or hold stock in \"certification\".",

We were seated in the patio area which wasn't bad at all because they had ample heat lamps.  Everybody was very comfortable.  Anyway, about the food:  * Skip the Romana (Caesar) salad.  It really has no taste, but the croutons are good.  * Also pass on the (Forno Fabbri) which is the bread they should just put on the table when you sit down instead of overcharging you $2 for it.  It pisses me off when restaurants do this.  * The Verdure Grigliate (grilled vegetables) were excellent.  I need to learn how to make these myself.  * We got 3 pizzas and it really doesn't matter what they were because they were all excellent.  Each one was better than the last.  The crust is sensational.  Easily made my top 5 pizzas in the Valley.  The place is gorgeous, its an older crowd so you don't get a lot of doucebags, and the service is excellent.

I was very impressed with how fast Cricket, the GM, replied to me and said that it was totally not what should have happened and asked me to give them another try.   Today I took my oldest son and two of my grandkids back to the same store. From the moment we arrived we felt very welcome, the host got the kids their coloring kids menus and we were seated promptly.   The kids loved their pizzas, not a bite left. I had the Don Alfonso Pizza and it was really tasty. My son had the Penne Boscaiola and I had to take a bite. This pasta was something I will have to return for this week. The cream sauce was not super heavy and had just the right mix of mushrooms, peas and meats   Everything was delish.   By the way, I did not announce my return so that I could get the normal treatment and experience it without any extra attention.    Redeemed!",

I ordered a kids pizza for my 1.5 year son and the server asked me what drink I would like to order for him so I asked for apple juice (thinking it's part of the kids meal) and asked her if she can fill up only half the cup so that I can add water to the rest of it. On our way out I asked if I can top up the juice with the other half since we were taking it to go and two of the servers kept taking the drink back and forth until they came back saying that they cannot top it up and that our server Melinda said she already put the entire juice can in there! I was very disappointed as it did not make sense that the server had put an entire juice can in there and the fact that they all made a big deal out of the apple juice just turned me off. I actually had my son's 1 year party at Pomo in May and always go there for lunches and dinners and what a shame it is to be turned down twice for asking for my son's apple juice to be topped up especially since I had only asked for half at the beginning. U sure lost a good customer tonight Pomo!!",

Fritto misto came with a nice portion of shrimp and squid as well as a dipping sauce. I had the Lasagna al Forno. Good portion, very creamy and rich just as the other dishes I tried which included the Strozzapreti Salsiccia and the Spacattelle Carbonara. Lasagna was the best hands down. We ended with the Torta de Nutella. Ordered that because we were told it was sooo good and you were able to pour the ganache over it. Well the cake tasted of refrigerator, not creamy and flourless. Our server said it is not made flourless anymore but the description in the menu was never changed. The chocolate fountain was broken so we didn't have any ganache. Yes it was disappointing because we were looking forward to that. The waiter stated he'd tried telling management to change that but they never listen, his exact words btw. I personally would have never mentioned that last part to a customer but hey he was honest. The food was good overall. I liked it.",

    "text": "This place was close by and had 4 star reviews so we decided to try it. The service was good but a tad slow at times until the next crew of servers arrived and ours had more help.  The dining room is modern looking with a high ceiling and rows of tables. A large covered outdoor space looks nice with large fan assisted misters for cooling.  The arancini are tasty and enormous - about the size of a baseball each, two for each order with marinara. They were filled with ground meat in tomato sauce, cubes of mozzarella and peas. The rice has a nice saffron flavor but not overpowering. The marinara sauce however was way too light and thin and lacked salt and flavor.  We ordered two pizzas - the quattro stagioni and the principe. The quattro stagioni was not your typical version with four distinct areas of separate ingredients on the pizza. This one had the four ingredients scattered all over the place - somewhat messy looking. It was also a bit wet in the center. We've had real Neapolitan pizza before and this seemed too wet - perhaps they are using fresh mozzarella which leaches out too much water in the oven?  The principe is a staple Neopolitan pizza (tomato sauce, a small amount of mozzzarella, then topped with prosciutto, arugula and parmesan after baking) and it had way too much mozzarella that leached out moisture making the center of the pizza really wet and sloppy. That diluted the flavors of the rest of the ingredients.  Others rave about the freshly made pasta - maybe that would be a better choice.",

    "text": "This pizza is outstanding if you only eat the outer ring of the pie. The crust is crispy and chewy all at the same time and the sauce and toppings are fresh and top quality. The problem is the soggy middle. It's damp and gooey and without texture, unless dampness and goo are considered textures. Disclaimer: the menu has a warning for us uncultured types who have never been to Napoli: the pizza's supposed to be this way. I'll have to take their word for it. And I apologize if I'm criticizing them for being what they are, like rejecting a dog for a wet nose.  That said, Pizzeria Bianco, a peer restaurant, manages to keep it crispy-chewy all the way through.  Follow-up:  the day after posting, I received a gracious note from a manager named Tessa. She told me they will gladly cook the pizzas longer if asked. I would definitely recommend that!  She really did leave a kind and professional message, which speaks volumes about the people running this place.",

    "text": "Pomo's move to this new location was definitely for the best... not only do they have the addition of Forno Fabbri 1949 (the market / mozzarella bar which I still need to try) under the same roof, but the entire space is gorgeous and the patio + indoor / outdoor bar is perfect!  I've been in several times, and I've never been disappointed.  The food and drinks are authentic, the staff are all friendly and knowledgeable, but the real reason to head to Pomo is to meet the owner, Stefano Fabbri.    I recently heard a Maya Angelou quote that I liked. It goes something like this: People will forget what you said. People will forget what you did. But people will never forget how you made them feel.   The reason I stick this quote in the middle of a Yelp review is because of Stefano.  He will make you feel like a VIP, and it's not just me... he works the room like a pro.  His accent, passion, and engaging personality will put a smile on your face and definitely make you want to return again and again...  Add to that your choice of cocktail or wine, antipasti, zuppe, insalate, pasta, and/or some Napoletana pizza straight from the wood burning oven... and you're sure to be one happy camper!  Note: Pomo's pizza is cerfied by the V.P.N. Verace Pizza Napoletana and the A.P.N. Associazione Pizzaiuoli Napoletani, both associations are based in Napoli, Italy.  It's the real deal!  I don't think you can go wrong with any of the above... but some standout menu items in my opinion are: *Arancini Siciliani (Homemade Fried Rice Ball, Fior di Latte, Sweet Peas, Meat Sauce ) *Zuppa Al Funghi (Homemade Creamy Mushroom Soup, Fresh Mushrooms, Onions, Evoo) *Lasagna and/or Gnocchi *Pizza classica: Napoli, Toto Sapore, and/or Capricciosa  Lastly, my advice to you: no matter what time of day or day of the week you plan on going: make a reservation!  The word on Pomo is out and it can get packed!  Buon appetito!",

The topping on the toasted bread was a mixture of diced tomatoes, olive oil, oregano, basil and another spice. It was plain and very odd not having cheese on it. 2 stars for the bruschetta.  The pizza here is absolutely delicious though! Wow. Wood-fired with obviously quality ingredients. The lasagna has to be the best lasagna I have ever had! I think it's necessary to order a pizza when you go here, but definitely order the lasagna too.  For dessert, we had creme brulee. It was yummy!  Overall, good service and good food. Don't get the bruschetta though.",

    "text": "This is my favorite pizza place. Ever.   The best part about their pizza, in my opinion, is the sourdough crust which is not only delicious, but also healthier for you (because it's sourdough it's easier to digest). As a family who abstains from gluten, except when offered True sourdough bread, or in this case, a pizza with sourdough crust, we enjoy it.   In fact, we learned about this place from a friend who raved about the sauce on the pizza and their gluten-free (not the sourdough) pizza option as she's celiac. Once I went online and saw they offered a sourdough pizza crust I knew I had to go that route. And? It's SOOOO GOOD!  I'm also impressed at Pomo's diligence in sourcing quality ingredients from Italy. We've had the pizza a few times as I can't seem to part with it, but I'm intrigued that they have wild-caught salmon in a dish on the menu and organic salads. And, in spite of not eating gluten unless as noted above, I probably have to sink my teeth into a cannoli one of these days.  The prices are perfectly reasonable, the decor is cool, and the service has (every time!) been top notch. They are attentive from the time we enter through to the time we leave. I highly recommend this place, and my family looks forward to it being our regular (i.e., only) pizza joint we frequent.",

I found about about this place back then, and kept going back over and over. The atmosphere, the service and the other dishes  also matched the pizza in terms of high qualityup . From the Borgata they moved more north to a larger location, then opened more locations. I tried them all and the quality is all consistentlu superb.  Unfortunately, I became severely gluten intolerant, and all I could do is make my own pizza, or buy frozen GF pizza. One of my family members became also intolerant, which is a very big deal, it poses a serious limitation to what you can eat, your ability to absorb nutrients and affects your social and personal life. Guess what? Pomo started making GF pizza, amd I am not exaggerating, the best in the world!!. I have tried many GF pizzas, including the one fromin  several chain restaurants and  other US cities, but no other GF pizza compares to it. My brother just visited from Italy, and feels that both, the regular and GF pizza would be a big hit even in Rome, where he lives, and all his family truly enjoyed it. Pomo recently added a gelato area, which is also superb and matches any very good gelato you would eat in Italy as well. I see that the same servers/floor managers have been loyal for years, which says everything about the business. This is a restaurant where the owner takes pride in what he does, and impressively keeps succeeding with excellent taste, quality, and courtesy.",

She simply wiped the old pieces of pizza crust on to the floor under our chairs.  Had to send our appetizer plates back as they were filthy.  Smeared with oil and finger prints.  Ordered two pastas and two kids meals.  One kid meal was penne with parmesan.  It arrived undercooked and swimming in melted butter.  No cheese.  We sent two full pastas back as again the plates were filthy.  And I stress filthy.  Smeared again with finger prints.   Spoke with manager.  Explained the kids meal and plate issues.  He explained they don't put cheese on the 'cheese pasta' because most kids are fussy when it comes to cheese.  He took our pastas away and returned with new servings but only half portions.  Our server then came by who wasn't briefed by manager.  She was shocked we were disappointed and she explained that SHE would remove the pasta from our checks.  I'm surprised the manager hadn't done this.  Terrible leadership here.   The food taste was mediocre.  I would not recommend here at all because of cleanliness and poor management.",

I am a little disappointed; I noticed this place is often busy when I shop at the Sprouts nearby, so I assumed it must be great, but it is just average.   The pizza was pretty descent. I wouldn't say it is the best I have had, but is much better than. Most pizza places. The pasta wasn't anything go write home about; the quality tasted like frozen pasta from the supermarket.  The biggest downside was the service. The waitress was not very observant about anything. She did not realize we had a baby until her third trip to the table when I asked for a plastic fork, so we could share with my 18 month daughter.On a couple of occasions I tried to get her as attention by raising my hand, only to see her look over and immediately turn the other way and walk inside to check on her other tables. At the end of the meal my daughter became impatient, so my wife went to sprouts to shop while I waited to pay the bill and get a to go box; it took 20 minutes to get the to go box. By the time I squared away the bill and got the to go box, my wife already went to sprouts and did the shopping.",

I split a margarita pizza and the gnocchi with marinara sauce with my father. They even had a vegan pizza for my brother!

    "text": "I have hit the trifecta!  I am mega rich.....in pizza,  that is.  I woke up this morning and was in the mood for some pizza (as always!).  I decided to drive down and check out the Pomo in Scottsdale.  This was the third, and last Pomo I have been to.  I parked in the lot, walked inside and was seated at a table. I sat there for a good 5 minutes or so before anyone came over to greet me.  I thought things were going to be bad, but they improved greatly later on.  My server arrived and I got a glass of water as well as a \"Peppino\" Pizza.  Here is how it was..........  Peppino Pizza-  This pizza had spicy salame and ricotta cheese as the toppings (in addition to the tomato sauce and fresh mozzarella).  I took a bite and was instantly impressed.  Those ovens sure make magic happen.  The crust was nicely charred but not burnt, the mozzarella was creamy, and the salame was plentiful and provided a nice carnivorous flavor.  The only thing I did not really like was the ricotta.  Sure, it was there, but it didn't really add anything to the mix.  Overall, this pizza (minus the ricotta) was fantastic.  It was just as good as their other locations for the most part.  At the end of my meal, my server came over and asked if it was my first time here.  I told him yes, this specific location,  and that I had been to the Downtown and Glendale ones before.  He started asking me which one I preferred (Downtown location BTW...just something about it) and then started talking to me about the ovens etc.  Somehow, this conversation we had made it to the manager, Terry.  He came over and introduced himself and thanked me for coming in.  He also said they were opening one in Gilbert in the next few months (Eastsiders, rejoice!).  Service started out a little rocky, but at the end it was awesome!    Not sure if I'm coming back to this specific one any time soon (the other 2 are closer to my house), but if you are in the area, you probably can't find a better pizza!  This place is legit and one of the best pizzas in Phoenix!",

Waiter did not offer good information about the food.  The pizzas were blend and lacked ingredients like basil, cheese in some.  One came over baked and burned.  The lasagna tasted processed.  Overall for what you pay, the pizzas tasted below average for the price you have to pay.    Pomo has a fabulous line up of gourmet pizzas and pasta dishes with many ingredients imported from Italy.  We had the buffalo verace and toto sapore (meat lover).  The atmosphere was great, service excellent.  The Nutella torte was very good but could have more hazelnut flavor. Be prepared to spend a few dollars for all the flavor, freshness and service.  We plan to go back!",

She should probably be given some sort of award or something as the best waitress I have ever had.   There is LIVE basil hanging on the wall. For real. Just walk up and see for yourself.   The olive oil is unbelievable.   I giant copper covered Pizza oven adds to the environment.   If you care, the salads are all organic. And the optional chicken on the salads is organic raised.   They have both gluten free and regular food.   I have never had anything that was less than \"unbelievably good\" at this restaurant.   On the other side of the restaurant is a small cafe that opens in the morning before the main restaurant. (Cafe is closed Sunday) It is the best expresso machine in Scottsdale, with the owner of the restaurant (sometimes) who actually knows how to make a real expresso or cappuccino. You should understand how rare this is. Note: The express or coffee you get in the main restaurant comes from the same expresso machine.   The pasteries remind me of being back in Italy.   You are not going to find an Italien place like this very often.   *Please take it easy on the wait staff, and please give them positive feedback when you write a review. These folks work hard, and are subject to a lot of reviews online, because this restaurant is growing in popularity.  One night I took my entire staff to eat here, and we were treated like royalty, even though the place was super busy.   Warning:  The one negative thing I would say is that Pomo's destroys the Pizza-eating experience for me when I go to other pizza restaurants. When I try eating what passes for pizza elsewhere, I just think to myself \"this is definitely not Pomo's. ; - )   - Russell Wright",

    "text": "Most of you know, I have an affinity for Neapolitan style pizza. And that's what makes Pomo Pizzeria in Scottsdale one of my favorite places to eat.   The thing I love most about Neapolitan style pizza is that I never walk away with a \"brick\" in my stomach...the dreaded \"I just ate pizza\" feeling.  ...Neapolitan style pizza is so light and satisfying, you'll never look at pizza the same way again!!  The lay of the land...  Pomo is located in the Shops at Gainey Village on the corner of Scottsdale Road. and Doubletree Blvd. The interior boasts high ceilings, an array of windows, and an indoor/outdoor bar concept.    But don't let the sleek and modern atmosphere fool you...the centerpiece of the whole operation is a hand-built, wood-burning oven crafted from bricks and volcanic sand from Southern Italy.  The oven is like a time machine that can transport your taste buds back hundreds of years to the heart of Napoli, Italy.  And it's right there in plain sight so you can watch the magic unfold.  Carpaccio Di Bresaola, the perfect starter...  Start your experience with a platter of razor-thin slices of tender cured beef carpaccio, buried under a pile of peppery arugula salad, tossed in a light lemon vinaigrette, and topped with Parmigiano Reggiano shavings.  There's plenty to share, and it's not too filling so it's the perfect way to start your authentic Italian journey.  Slow-rising Sourdough Crust...  The secret to Pomo's light and chewy crust lies in the highly-refined, organic wheat flour imported 6,267 miles from Molino Caputo in Naples. This slow-rising sourdough takes 24 hours to rise and only 60-90 seconds in the 905 degree oven to produce a piping hot pizza with bubbly cheese and a perfectly charred crust.  The Bufala Verace -- it's what dreams are made of...  The beauty of this pie lies in the simplicity of the ingredients: Tomato, basil, cheese. That's it. With every bite there's a burst of tang from the crushed tomato base, holding hands with creamy Mozzarella di Bufala D.O.P., and a fresh basil finish.  What is D.O.P.?  You'll notice several items on the menu with initials D.O.P.  This stands for the Italian phrase \"Denominazione d' Origine Protetta\".  It means the product is a higher level of certification and authenticity.  It could easily stand for \"Definitely Oozes Perfection\". ;-)  Mozzarella di Bufala D.O.P. is a superior mozzarella cheese made from Italian water buffalo milk, and imported fresh each week. And Tomato San Marzano D.O.P. are the only kind of tomatoes have been designated as the ONLY tomatoes that can be used for a TRUE Neapolitan style pizza.  Ask for a some chili oil to drizzle over the top and dip your crust in if you like a little kick!!  Toppings vs. purity...  If you're American, you're probably used to Supreme or Meat Lovers Deluxe style pizza --- more toppings the better.  In Napoli, this would be a crime... punishable by starvation or firing squad.    Neapolitan style pizza typically has more sauce than cheese, leaving a wet and slightly soggy middle which is why Italians dig in to their pies with a fork and knife.  When you taste The Bufala Verace in it's pure form, your outlook on pizza will be forever changed!!  With food and love,  -Ashley  P.S. When you visit Pomo Pizzeria, please let them know you read my review.  And then, come back here and tell me about your experience.  I love to hear from my readers and get feedback from friends!!",

    "text": "I am very happy with the new location! Everything in terms of service and quality of food remainder the same and now the addition of more space and the grab and go grocery area just make the experience that much better!   I've been lucky enough to visit Italy and try authentic Italian pizza. While I have tried the Napolean pizza, I will say that it was in Rome and not Naples, but that didn't seem to make a difference in taste to me. Needless to say, the pizza I had in Rome was the pizza I use to weigh against any other slice of pizza. Pomo Pizzeria has come pretty darn close to authentic pizza in my book.   Make a reservation because it will fill up, especially on the weekends!  We started with the bruschetta and Cesar salad (Romana) to share. The salad is huge and you could probably share it with two to three other people. It was zesty, creamy and delicious. The order of bruschetta gave us two pieces of bread heaping with tomatoes and mozzarella. I got a side of vinegar which was the perfect touch. If you are with a party of more than two, I'd suggest ordering two orders of bruschetta or you can cut each slice in half.   Now let's move on to the pizza, for this is what Pomo Pizzeria is known for is it not? Oh friends, the pizza is exactly what you hope for it. It tastes like it's straight from the streets in Italy. We got the Quattro Stagioni which has tomato, San Marzano DOP, mozzarella, fior di latte, sauteed mushrooms, Italian Sausage, etc. The bread was thin crust but soft and melted in my mouth. The crust was fluffy and soft. The pizza is definitely large enough to split and the combo of salad, bruschetta and pizza worked out perfectly. The reviews are right in saying that this pizza is absolutely excellent and comparable to the other great pizza places in the Valley and their new location allows even more people to enjoy it now!",

    "text": "After being told this is a must try, I decided to take the plunge with my wife and some friends after a day of tanning during a stay-cation in the Gainey area. We arrived at around 8pm without reservations (I have read that they may be required) but we did not want a firm schedule, so we took the risk, and it played out strangely.   We walk in all looking a little worse for wear after having been in the sun for the better part of 8 hours, as we were staying at a nearby resort enjoying the weather. Perhaps this was the reason for the service we received, which included being told there weren't any tables ready, which we were fine with, but then being greeted by no less than three groups being seated before us even though they to admitted to the hostess that they did not have reservations!  We were a party of 4 and the groups seated before us, but after we put our name in, were all parties consisting of 2x4 & 1x2. Not a big deal, but I am certain this had more to do with the fact we were in board shorts, and our wives were in sun dresses with there hair up, than a lack of tables. My wife being a little put off approaches the hostess again to find out that luckily a table has just opened up! Hmmmm...   We are seated and greeted by an exceptionally nice waiter who offers water for the table, and asks if we would like any additional beverages. I ask what his wine suggestions would be, as this is an Italian restaurant whom people tout as having excellent regional food, to which I get a reply of \"I have no idea, I haven't been to Italy\" ..  Granted, We have been all over Italy, but even without having done that I would expect a waiter to have at minimum of 4 go to bottles to suggest for a guest who may not know what to expect from the wine selection.  Since he cannot help me out, I decide to go with a bottle of bubbly since it was a hot evening, and we were on the patio with friends, I felt it was an easier choice then trying to go through the motions of getting everyone's opinion and trying to please the crowd.   The waiter brings the bottle, without a chiller: hot night - chiller = gross champagne  Conversation ensues.... Chiller finally brought out.. Another bottle never offered.. Flutes never touched up..  We order Food:   PRINCIPE: (Pizza) Prosciutto Crudo di Parma DOP, Fresh Arugula,  Shaved Parmigiano Reggiano  This very same pizza can be had at Hanny's, but there it is made with some sense of care for the patrons eating it (toppings not just thrown on top and fired) The flavors were a little bland, the crust was still doughy, and the Parmiganiano was barely present.. I find that it is almost impossible to abort a pizza of this simplicity, but this completely missed the mark. I wish I had something good to say about it, but it just was not good, and more than half was left untouched.  LASAGNE AL FORNO: Layers of Lasagne Pasta with Homemade Meat Sauce, Besciamella Cream & Parmigiano Reggiano  Best way to describe it: Chef Boyardee canned lasagna - Watery, little meat, flat notes throughout, about the size of a small napkin and an inch tall.   That is it.  $15   At this point we decided dinner was over, as we were going to keep ordering dishes to share, but after two misses it just was no longer worth it.   Bad service, subpar food, and price points about $5 over what this food should be sold at. Also, This is not real Italian, unless you have never traveled through Italy, which is the point of view I assume most of the reviews are written from. Again, I really wanted to like this place after all I had read about it, but I cannot help but wonder if this is a case of people liking it simply to not be the guy who doesn't (Like the Pizzeria Bianco craze)",

For dinner I had the pizza Capricciosa.  The pizza was classically made; thin, relatively soft in the middle, with a chewy slightly burned crust.  Delicious.  Some people don't like how the tip of a slice of this kind of pizza is limp, but it's due to how thin the crust is and the tomato sauce and toppings tend to weigh it down.     We were a party of 10, and everyone enjoyed their food.  One person, someone who knows their pasta, got a penne with tomato sauce and didn't like it because it was too al dente.  Otherwise, everything was great.    We finished with gelato and profiteroles which were very good.  We came back a second time because of the overall quality and options.",

We got a couple appetizers,  a salad and 2 pizzas.    Unfortunately our server was horrible.   Our drinks we always empty, we didn't get drinks until after at least 10 minutes after being seated and a different server asked if we had been helped yet.  Luckily the other guy watched out for us the whole time.  He constantly filled our drinks and took away an armful of empty dishes from our table.  It appeared that we had the only inadequate server there as everyone else seemed very attentive.     After dinner we walked over to the market and we're able to learn a ton about olive processing and olive oils.   It was really interesting how much knowledge these guys have and the passion for food is exciting.   We had our dessert on that side giving us a chance to walk around a bit after dinner.  Dessert was fantastic too.  I don't remember what it was but it was frozen and had bits of fig and nuts with a crumbled crust like surface strawberries and caramel drizzle.   They also have a vintage Vespa to take pictures on in front of the restaurant.   Fun place with great food!  We will be telling everyone we know to try it and we will be back.    Some nice live, authentic Italian music would really add a nice touch to the place.",

    "text": "My friend and I met for lunch. There are so many great restaurants in the Valley and I think with some changes there is potential here. Ambiance can be vastly upgraded with the replacement of the huge photo/wallpaper of a back street in the poorer section of Naples. Talk about depressing! With all the possibilities of scenes of la Bella Italia, why choose this one? This in itself certainly does not signal a quality dinning experience. On to the food ....  I ordered the Pollo Salad. The chicken was warm and tender; it was served over mixed field greens with a tasty lemon/oil dressing. I was disappointed that there so few cherry tomatoes and pine nuts. They certainly need to be a bit more generous here. No fresh ground pepper was offered and no bread was served with the meal.  My friend was satisfied with her pasta dish. We ordered espresso. It was warm and served without a lemon peel twist. I did not say anything. It's not the wait staff's fault. The waitress was pleasant and attentive. Is this an Italian restaurant ... or what? Would I return? I am not sure. Everyone deserves a second chance; however, the owner has be at it for quite a while. I am not a big pizza fan - their forte. That being the case, then the restaurant needs to be rated as such. If they are going  to serve meals, then don't skimp on the tomatoes, pine nuts and bread. Per piacere (please) serve the espresso - HOT.   We, of Italian descent, understand good food. Grazie!",

Lasagna made with ground beef instead of sausage? It's good but- I don't recommend it if you want a bold flavor. Speaking of that- pizza sauce was mild and not enough on mine (although, it would have just run off). Pizza dough was so good I could not believe it. So- another visit is in order. Sit at the bar. Order beer and get a cheese pizza. Maybe put a topping on the side so it won't slide off!",

    "text": "Pomo! This is my spot right here. Lisa and I love going here. Their pizza is on point. I think they have the best non-Chicago style pizza in Arizona. Forget Pizzeria Bianco. This place is the best. Trust me. Pomo is very spacious. Their ingredients are the best I have had in Arizona. The staff is very friendly and the service is always impeccable.  They have a store there which sells olive oil and balsamic which if you know me is my fav. I would like to think I am an aficionado when it comes those. If you order bread you get to try their olive oil and balsamic that they sell there. It is the best I have ever had.  Their dessert is amazing as well. Their bread pudding is top notch.  I have tried various food items here and they are all good. They have a nice patio as well.  Pomo is a good date spot. I can hardly wait for them to open the new location in Gilbert.  Check Pomo out. You won't be disappointed.",

Although I wish that we could review the food, after 15 minutes at the bar we were only given water and no menus. The bartender was clearly under the weather and said so much. Not our problem. Good luck if you venture in for a Sunday lunch.",
