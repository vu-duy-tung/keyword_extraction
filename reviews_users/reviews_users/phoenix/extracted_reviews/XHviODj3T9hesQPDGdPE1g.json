    "text": "Within minutes of being here, I felt at home. Strange, I know. I relocated from Chicago recently and this reminded me of the bar and grills I liked to dine in there. Buckets of peanuts on the table. Throw the shells on the floor! Great menu. I was easily torn between 4 sandwiches and asked for advice from our lovely server who steered me towards the Jack, not Jill sandwich. It was a deliciously grilled chicken breast with jack cheese, bacon, avocado and lettuce. It was delicious! Enough to cut in half and take home for later. The curly fries were slightly overdone. There are a lot of sides to choose from so I'll just try another next time. Onion rings and mozzarella  wrappers were awesome! Pretty pumped to bring friends here when they visit and try more of the yummy sandwich options! Oh, and wings! Yum!",

    "text": "All right.  It's come-to-Jesus time.  It's hard to watch a thriving business implode, but that's what is happening here.  I've been a regular at this Teakwoods for about 7 years now.  My husband and I liked the atmosphere, food and friendliness so much that it's safe to say we even considered this when we bought our house (within walking distance) back in 2007.  Everyone who worked there was welcoming and hard-working, from the bartenders to the servers to the bussers.  The wings (and other dishes) were great (especially as sports-bar food goes), beer selection was good, prices were reasonable.  We've seen staff (and management) come and go, but we've remained loyal, and actually have stayed good friends with many current and ex-employees, who have become like family to us.  But things have been steadily going downhill, and now I think they've nearly reached rock bottom.    It started with cosmetic stuff.  Leaky ceilings, scruffy empty shelves behind the bar for a long time, mismatched and shabby (and some downright uncomfortable) furnishings, tatty bathrooms.  Then, the food.  We used to look forward to the daily specials; now it seems management is finding ways to \"repurpose\" leftovers or overstocks in new and unappealing ways and, frankly, in weird combinations.  Sliced hot dogs on a lavosh? Really?  Even one of my previously favorite appetizers, the caprese (oh--now spelled \"caprice\" on the menu) tastes bland and worn out.  I used to LOVE the creamy, cheesy, meaty cheeseburger soup when it appeared on the menu, but I had it just a couple of days ago and was disappointed to find it watery, virtually tasteless, and sorely lacking in the meat department.  Prices were raised (during the recent Arizona Beer Week; talk about opportunistic!), and a rash of regulars left in protest, and have stayed away.  But I and a dozen or so other regulars remained, largely because of the friendly and efficient service of a few remaining long-time servers there, along with a few awesome bartenders and wonderful bussers.  The service in general had also gone down over time, but management seems to want to drive it right into the dirt, as they decided this week to get rid of two of their best servers.  That was the last straw for pretty much all of the regulars who had remained.  I feel like I'm going through a divorce.  It's sad and depressing to watch, slowly but surely, a decent business and a fun place run into the ground (going much the same direction, apparently, as the recently closed Maricopa and Phoenix locations of Teakwoods have gone) by bad management and poor decisions, who put \"profits\" over people.  Why did I even give this place TWO stars? For the handful of wonderful staff who remain--AND for the wings, which are still great.  But if you MUST have them, I'd advise you to get them to go!",

    "text": "I am from the East Coast and am used to dive bars being a certain way, but this one is truly unique in that there are peanut shells littering the floors.  As I sat there, eating the roasted peanuts, and waiting for my food to arrive, I felt uneasy dumping my shells onto the floor.  I said to my friend, OMG, littering is okay here and I do not know how I feel about this.    So after my initial shock of dropped peanut shells and the first bite of my Sue-Ruben, and the country music performers on stage creating a nice atmosphere, I started to get into the groove of things.  Throwing your shells on the floor can actually be quite liberating! lol  I am a foodie and I must say that I was impressed with their take on the turkey ruben.  It was not as yummy as some of the places that make turkey rubens in NJ or NYC, but it truly did come in second for my taste buds.    My friends wings were a little bland and the hot sauce that he ordered on the side was not that appealing.  Maybe I need to try more of their wings another time, since everyone seems to love them; but I am a stickler at times.  The service was amazing and they had great drink specials, although I did not partake because I had been drinking earlier at RnR in Scottsdale and my stomach needed a rest.  Go here for: A great country-like setting, great sandwiches, good service, and nice drink specials.  I will be back.",

    "text": "I was told about this place several months ago and every time I was in Phoenix, I just plain forgot....that was until about a week ago.  As usual, my girlfriend and I were looking for a place to eat and could not decide where to go.  We were both getting grumpy and hungry when I remembered, finally, Teakwoods!  A friend of mine had told me about their wings and how good they were.  I told him I like HOT and he said that I would love this place for their suicide wings.  When we walked in I first noticed the peanut shells all over the floor and the buckets of peanuts on the tables, \"Cool I can make a mess and not get yelled at!\"  We sat down and the waitress came right over to us with menus and took our drink orders.  She was the only waitress there for the first half of our visit and she didn't miss a beat even though there were about five other tables, unfortunately I can't remember her name, but it was a very unusual name.  My girlfriend and I both order the suicide wings and we were not at all disappointed.  The flavor was great!  They were extremely hot, but not enough to kill the chicken flavor and they didn't have that vinegary \"sauce-out-of-the-bottle\" taste that many wings have.  I will be honest, it was our first visit, but not our last!  Also, don't forget to scan the tag and get 15% off your food bill!",

    "text": "Definitely a dive bar.  It was really dark in there when we got there around 5:30pm.  There is a \"restaurant\" side to it where they seat families with children, which I can appreciate, even having a small child myself.  Service was decent.  Had to wait a little bit for our waters and other drinks, and had to ask twice for a cup of water for our son.  Food was actually a little bit better than I anticipated, though my expectations were low just based on appearances.  I ordered the Chicken Jack, which was a chicken burger with avocado, bacon, & pepperjack cheese.  The ranch beans was a pretty good side too.  If you're looking for a nice, clean, peaceful place to take your family to enjoy a nice dinner, this isn't the place for you.  If you want a place to hang out, throw down a few beers, watch some UFC, and throw peanut shells on the ground as you eat them, then you found your spot.  I won't be a regular there, but I am not opposed to going back in the future.  Side note:  They accept the Passport card.  You get a free entree of equal or lesser value.  That's really why I tried this place out.",

Yes, it's good this place is a drive for me.   Love the Midwest tavern vibe of this place. Cameron was our server tonight and he was fantastic. It's always nice when your server loves the food he serves. His recommendations were great. The jalapeno popper potato skins were very good, but they would be amazing with bacon (hell, what isn't?!). They are served with a concoction called cactus sauce--sweet, tangy, yup this could go on anything. Can't wait to try it on their wings. My husband loved that he could get a fried egg on his burger and I really enjoyed my buffalo chicken tacos. Wish they had a cocktail menu, but this is really a cold beer place anyway. We will be back!",

I have always enjoyed the food.. it's not Ruth's Chris, but it is always fresh and the daily specials are most-always spot-on.   What really intrigues me is that they seem to be hanging on to their age-old beer selection,... carrying just the drivel put forth by Bud/Miller/Coors... Four Peaks is now owned by Bud. Blue Moon has been owned by Coors since its inception. I sure wish Teakies would wake up and smell the coffee as far as having REAL craft beers on tap. Please guys/gals!  Was surprised to have the place be near-empty for Thursday Night Football night last week. Maybe it;'s time to join the craft beer wave.",

She continued to let out her frustration with us loudly and mentioned it every time she walked by.

We noticed there were peanut shells on the floor...cool, it's one of those places.  Since they were so busy it took a long time to get our order placed.  We had to flag down a server to get her attention.  Since we didn't want to wait twice, we ordered our Beer and food at the same time.  We browsed the menu and decided to order:  Nachos, $10.99 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teakwoods-tavern-and-grill-chandler?select=ruOZKt-DpRCwkcmVfGWchg#ruOZKt-DpRCwkcmVfGWchg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/teak...</a> <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teakwoods-tavern-and-grill-chandler?select=AqTkhQINOjPqzCu6D0Xrqw#AqTkhQINOjPqzCu6D0Xrqw\">yelp.com/biz_photos/teak...</a>  Philly Cheesesteak, $10.99 <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/teakwoods-tavern-and-grill-chandler?select=xeOWkFF0VogD-h3tJYsJ0g#xeOWkFF0VogD-h3tJYsJ0g\">yelp.com/biz_photos/teak...</a>  The Nachos were huge, enough for 2 people.  They were good and had decent flavor.  The Guac and Sour Cream come in small cups so you have to dip your Chips in them or take a knife to put on your Chips....I don't prefer to eat my Nachos that way.  The Philly Cheesesteak was pretty good too....far from the best I've ever had, but decent.  There were plenty of TV's in the restaurant, so we were able to keep apprised of the hockey/football games on the tube.  We had to flag down the server for refills of the Beer....that was the one downside to the visit was the service.  Perhaps we caught them on a short-handed night?  I dunno....  Return Factor - 50%",

    "text": "We had flat \"affect\" waiter.  Yes, our waiter had about as much personality as Data on Star Trek the Next Generation. On another occassion, our waitress left us on the island. You know what I mean, \"here is your food, I will check on you in 45 minutes and see if you are still alive then\"  Then one fine day, we had \"Alcohol Only\" waitress. Our waitress was friendly at first until she realized we were not going to order a bevy of drinks and rack up a thick bill and hang out for an hour. We were immediately disqualified from good service the rest of the evening. On another occassion, we had the \"The Flash\"  You know this waitress. If you don't know already know what you want to order and have questions, you are given a penalty. If you ask her for her opinion, she says in a very stoned face and quick manner \"it's good\" no descriptors, no recommendations but simply \"It's good\"  Then if you pause even for  a second, she says \"I will be right back let me get this other table their drinks really quickly while I give you time to decide\"  Then we had \"Charity Case\" waitress. This waitress is probably a hardworking college student or a mother of 5 at the age of 25 who hasn't slept in 3 days. Because of her situation, it is our job as patrons to be considerate and aware of her situation so if she messes up our order, forgets to refill our drinks, or gives us a dirty look if we ask for ketchup\" we are supposed to forget all that.  CONCLUSION: So you are probably wondering if the service is so bad, why do I keep coming here, the food is actually pretty good and it's darn right cheap! Seriously, you can have a full dinner for 20 bucks. It's bar food done well. But what I like is the food still tastes like bard food. It's not haughty gourmet bar food that you find at Jillys or Peyton's Place. I don't want a kaiser roll for my burger, I want a normal bun! I don't want sweet potato fries, I want regular fries! t's just sad because if the service improved, we would come here more often. The only warning with regard to the food is to stick to the classic bar food items. If you see \"shrimp\" , \"scallop\" or anything that sounds like it could be offerred at a real restaurant, don't order this item. It's rather funny because people who had bad experiences here ordered the \"Jalapeno Shrimp Caesar salad Wrap\"..oklay that item doesn't exist but you get the idea.. Think burger, nachos, fried cheese, chicken sanwhich! Outside of those items, the food is prepared in a replicator hence the reason it doesn't taste good. The servers come in that rare cross breed of ASU apathy with \"West Side\" sensibility. I would also recommend you adhere to it's strict dress code if you want good service. If you are male, wear a wife beater, shorts, flip flops, Oakley sunglasses, and preferably a goatee. If you are female, wear the same thing as the guys but no goatee, instead substitute that with a rose tattoo on the back of your neck",

They are pretty big and very filling, the crunch on the outside wonton was an interesting change from your basic breaded stick.  Not bad for an appetizer.  My coworker brought me here for the wings though.  They were cooked well, with a nice crispy skin, and the Hot BBQ sauce was on point.  Meaty and delicious.  Washed down with a couple Kilt Lifters, I left with a very full belly.  Respectable wings!",

We ordered El Heffe, the Thai wings, and regular old hot. I loved the hot myself, they were HOT, a couple levels over Hooters hot. Flavor was great. The Thai wings had fresh basil leaves fried on and chili flakes in the sauce. My guest loved them, Also the heffe wings with Cilantro and garlic grilled onto them were pretty good. I still prefer the good old hot wing which we ordered with a great blue cheese dressing on the side. Comes with carrots and celery  Beer was old and they always give you a fresh iced glass with a refill, This is a wonderful thing....bill was very reasonable $15 for beers and wings.

    "text": "Teakwoods is our local hangout now, but we had been there even before we moved nearby. They have a great variety on their menu, which is increasingly tough to find. I love that it isn't the typical \"burgers/sandwiches, wings, and pizza\" that we seem to find at so many places now. The dishes aren't necessarily innovative, but that isn't what we're going there for. The menu reads like a summary of everything my mom ever made us for dinner growing up, and it's one of the few places where I get something different every time I go.  The kids love the arcade games and the peanuts, and with such a casual atmosphere to the place it's just a really agreeable choice. If we wanted inventive menu options or a huge beer list or healthier food options, etc. we could certainly find somewhere else for those things, but there's always a trade off. At the end of the day, this place is pretty good at everything that is important for us and it's an easy choice- especially when we're meeting up with a group where everyone might have different tastes. I really don't think I'd change much about Teakwoods because it's just nicely balanced as it is.  I would recommend the lavosh and their house wing sauces (Cactus and Jess Jess are my favs).",

My son ordered the chicken mac mac and didn't like it (too bad because the portions were big) and my other son ordered the Philly cheese steak.  He said there were too many onions but that's understandable coming from a teenager.  Service was always good and like having peanuts on the table to get the hunger edge off while we're waiting for the food.",

Peanuts are available on all tables, and you may channel your inner savage by discarding the shells on the floor. The bar feels a bit dank because of these said shells.   I was intrigued by the \"Specialties\" portion of the menu and decided to order a French Dip sandwich. Unfortunately there was nothing special about the sandwich other than the fact it was especially bad. It also was obvious that the fries had been sitting for a while. That being said, the drink specials are awesome - definitely cannot beat a $6 pitcher! They have a few other beverages on their drink-special menu as well.  If you are looking to watch a game and drink beer, I would recommend this place. I hope the other options on their menu are better than my sandwich! Order at your own discretion.",

Since they won 2012 Best Wings ( If you are into that) and it fits the bill nicely. The wait staff are all really friendly from the hostesses to the bus people.  It's a pretty typical neighborhood bar although they do have a separate section of the restaurant for families to hang out so you have less of the \"Sweet Home Alabama\" looks.  It's a very comfy place with lots of TV's and always a people around.  The wings according to all my friends are very good.  Since I am a vegetarian I highly recommend the ultimate grilled cheese sans bacon.  It's not the healthiest thing you could ever have, but it goes great with a Snake-Bite.  I also appreciate that any of their burgers can be ordered with a veggie patty so you can switch up from the grilled cheese every once in awhile. The food is really good and way above what you would expect from you standard bar food.  This is a great bar if you want a friendly atmosphere and good food.  Try: * Onion Rings * Ultimate Grilled Cheese w/ Snake-Bite * Pretzel Appetizer * $2.99 Jager shots",

However, they have messed up our order more than once on the wings & we have since discovered The Tavern Grill in Scottsdale.  I am a big fan of ranch dressing but the ranch at Teakwoods is just not good. For good ranch I go to The Tavern Grill or Long Wong's or IHOP or The Chuckbox. Once we ordered extra carrots & celery with the order of wings & ended up with 4 of each instead of 2 of each (for an extra charge). The drinks are HUGE which is good so you don't have to worry about getting a refill but sometimes we don't drink very much so we end up wasting a lot of soda.  There are MULTIPLE televisions everywhere you look & a jukebox which you can pay to play. There is also a golfing video game. There are complimentary peanuts on the table but one afternoon I noticed birds pecking at them on the outdoor tables so I am bit iffy on whether I would eat them. The booths are quite large, easily fitting 6 people comfortably which is good for big families. Overall, the price is a bit more than I'd like to pay for the food you get.  The pretzel with cheese is our favorite thing on the menu.",

    "text": "Take anything you want from me, Anything. Fly on little wing.  Came here the other night to try their wings. Got here before my friend did and sat in the crowded dining section in the east wing of the restaurant. Noticed the peanut shells on the floor - sorta creating the same effect as sawdust on the floor at Bill Johnson's Big Apple restaurants. My friend was bragging that this place had the hottest wings he never tried. Wuss. One of his friends tried the hottest wings on sale here and started sweating and crying and could not finish them. Over time and many beers I've heard that same legend over and over stretch to include emergency vehicles, demonic possession, terrorists/US military wanting the recipe so it could be weaponized, fire-breathing and whatnot until I finally said - ok we're going there - I need to know for myself. I ordered the suicide wings - traditional. No waivers had to be signed, nobody standing around with fingers on 911 speed dial button. Seemed like a standard thing to order at this place. Ok. Cool. When the wings came, they looked like any other \"hot\" wings. Tabasco colored little wings just sitting there waiting for me. Grabbed the first one and took a bite. Tasted vinegary hot sauce - good stuff. But the burn kept up as if all my teeth suddenly grew little wicks and turned into lit candles. Whoa - a CONSTANT burn even after the wing is done. Took the next wing and same thing. Ended up instinctively grabbing my beer to put out the fire. Wow. Perhaps the story had some merit - Teakwood's suicide wings aren't wussy at all like a lot of other places that claim to have super hot wings. When I finally got through all the wings, my friend noticed that I consumed four beers in the time it took him to drink one. Most times we go to a bar it is the exact opposite situation. Our waitress was even nice enough to bring me a tall glass of ice water as well. I'll have to admit, I have recently been on a quest for the hottest wings and most places have failed to impress - haven't finished the quest but I'm putting a flag down here for now as the hottest I've had so far. Was a bit concerned I'd find out the True meaning of \"fire in the hole\" the next day but fortunately that wasn't the case. Funny thing we got here at peak dinner time and when we left just around 11pm the place was a ghost town. If I didn't see another table of customers in a far corner I would have thought they were closed. They're open till midnight most days except for weekends when they close a little later. Plenty of parking in the mall it shares with Walgreens and Thailicious.",

    "text": "Initially, my thought was to give Teakwoods four starts.  Then I started writing my review . . .   I can't speak to the other locations, as I have never been, but this Teakwoods is pretty awesome.    The atmosphere here is chill. The food is great! Good, strong drinks and good beer selection. Casual friendly service. The list goes on and on.  I've been coming here for years.  I even think this was the first stop on my 21st birthday celebration many moons ago . . . YIKES!    They have lots of TVs for the sports fans.  I will happily come here to \"watch the game\" because I know that I'm not going to have to sacrifice getting a good meal.  There are even healthy options if that's my goal for the day.  I love the daily drink and quesadilla specials! There are usually 4-5 drinks on special every day, plus a beer of the month, and already great prices on everything else.  The daily specials food menu ensures there is always something new on the menu for the regulars.   The Buffalo Chicken Lavosh is fantastic (see pic), however I don't advise eating it alone, even the \"half\" size is huge!  The salads are good; and I am picky about my salads!  Chicken sandwiches are great.  Sliders are legit.  Wings are some of the biggest and best around!  Gyros are tasty with the nice soft pita bread.  They have vegetarian options too!  Oh, and breakfast!  I wasn't kidding, the list does go \"on and on!\"  A few other details, Teak's has a great juke box and a semi-separate room next door for families or big groups, it's a little less bar-ish.  Even if there isn't a game on (really, does that happen anymore?) there is always a good time to be had a Teakwoods.  The more I write about how solid this place is, I have know idea why I was only going to give it four stars. So, I figure, \"What the heck?\"   As far as sports bars go, Teakwoods is as good as it gets! In fact, it is really more than just a sports bar, it is a great restaurant and bar plus sports.  Five stars it is!",

They are one of the few places that offer numerous types of French fries and each type of fries are really yummy. My favorite is the sweet potato fries and not every place offers those. My husband loves the club! I have taken a bite or two of the club myself and its high quality lunchmeat. I also really enjoy the chicken mac mac.   This is definitely a great place!",

    "text": "I'm glad that they have a Teakwoods in the East Valley, because it became my first favorite wing place after moving here. After finding other worthy wing options in the greater Phoenix metro area, I would qualify these wings as completely respectable. I can testify that the wings here are properly sauced, reasonably crispy, and meatier than most. I know some of you gals out there are very particular about the ever-important meat-to-bone ratio, so this is why I mention it. (There's a dirty joke in there somewhere... I just KNOW it!)  Anyhow, I'm a big fan of the unlimited peanuts/throw-your-shells-on-the-floor thing, so kudos for that. Here, however, is my main gripe: You really oughta chill your salads! I come here for the wings and I often order a side salad (perhaps to feel better about my chicken-meat gluttony or just to be right with that whole Atkins-on-crack approach). Every time I've been here, the salad has been a bit less than palatable because it sat somewhere warm before being brought to me. Chilled salad, good -- warm salad, bad!  So although my heart now belongs to other wing-serving establishments, I'll never forget you, Teakwoods. I respect you for your frosty beers and your bountiful nuts. And every now and then I may have to come back and sample your goodies. Just a nibble or two... to remind me of the love we once shared. (O.K.--Not to anthropomorphize a restaurant, but that last passage had dirty jokes resplendent!)",

We ordered the wings and crispy (not a fan of fatty) and when they came they were devoured!  They were perfectly cooked, not too spicy and 2 dozen was perfect for two people.    We also got to talk to and thank the manager (Matthew I think) and wanted to say that you should give them a try.  There is a surcharge right now due to shortage, but it was worth it for sure!",

We ordered a raspberry iced tea and a lemonade. $2.95 each, free refills. Cups are 32oz. We had the mozzarella stick with marinara sauce at $8.99. Overpriced for what they are. Tasted fine but l think the Gilbert location does a better job than this one in Chandler.  Next l had the fish taco.  It consisted in small nuggets of fried fish topped with a pick de Gallo, shredded red cabbage. Tacos were lined by two corn tortillas each.  The bean dip tasted very good and it was my favorite part of the meal. I ate part of it, left the excessive amount of corn tortilla and foufou chips. I disliked those little fish nuggets, they reminded me of dry dog food, round and brown.   Ron had the chicken macmac, shredded chicken in penne pasta topped with cheese sauce. He ate it but left half of it and didn't ask for a to go box, it wasn't the kind of food worth eating twice.",

The best aspect of this place, as a certified wing \"junkie\" are the Jess Jess and El Jefe wings, which are among the best in the Valley.  The recent $3.00 surcharge on a dozen wings was explained in a placard with our menu.  Apparently, they're having supplier price increases and are passing along the increase to customers.  All well and good, but $3.00 for a dozen costing $11.49?  And to top it off, these were much smaller than the usual excellent wings Teakwoods offers.  Something doesn't add up.    I eat wings at a lot of the local joints, and none have reported this issue.  While I'm not above paying more for quality, I have a problem with a 26% surcharge for miniature wings compared to the former product.  I'll eat elsewhere until this is straightened out.  Find a new supplier or remove this item from the menu.  It's gouging.",

The atmosphere of the bar is a little different, as they seem to be going for a Texas Road House-style peanut eating place.  The peanuts are in huge buckets at the table, and you are encouraged to eat them and smash the shells on the floor.  I like peanuts and I love smashing things, and let's face it...being drunk is a blast, so when you combined all three and then add in some delicious chicken wings and hot servers, how can someone not recommend?",

Yesterday's visit with my hubby at 3:30 p.m. (on a Saturday) - we were one of only two tables occupied in the restaurant side. The bar side was hopping and noisy! We felt a little ignored because the wait staff was so focused on the bar side. When we were served, we immediately asked for tartar and BBQ sauces, and by the time we asked a second time (the first guy forgot us completely), our food was almost cold. But still great. They switched our plates - hubby got the well-done, I got the medium-well burger, and it was too late by the time we realized it to switch back (after the condiments were on). Ugh.   If we were served by the same person who waited on us, these mistakes wouldn't have happened - it's the result of having 2-3 people coming to our table. Plus they charge extra for tartar and BBQ - .50 each. Really? I've never had this happen at any other restaurant.   But this is still one of our very favorite local places!!!",

So delicious. i had a chicken sandwich that was decent - a bit big and overwhelming for my taste but definitely tasted great. But the drinks - mmm. They had a whipped cream flavored vodka and put that in rootbeer to make the most amazing \"root beer float\" ever. Loved it. I also really like places that have cute specials for every day of the week, I like that feel of a place that you could go several times in a week and have a good time every time.

I know this was a horrible incident, but realistically it could have happened anywhere (and does). They reacted the best way they could, by calling the police. With the proliferation of guns in this country, shootings like this are all too common. If the place had metal detectors and did pat downs before letting anyone enter, then you'd be complaining about that. AND, since this all happened outside, those measure wouldn't have helped anyway.   I would think Teakwoods would be one of the safer bets in town now, since their staff is bound to be way more security-conscious.   And Teakwoods does have a business to run - comping the entire place would have been a serious economic hardship, especially considering that their business must have plummeted in the aftermath due to people being unrealistically frightened to return.",

    "text": "I've frequented Teakwoods for the past 10 years. And this place has changed for the worse. It used to be a trendy ski-lodge Wisconsin-Colorado bar with cute and friendly waitresses. The crowd used to be a young educated crowd who would come here for drinks before venturing out to Scottsdale or Tempe.    Now, it almost feels like a glorified Applebees.  The crowd has gotten older. You see a lot of good ole boys and meatheads eat here. The waitresses transformed from being fun and cute girls that you would see in a trendy Tempe bar to homely girls who don't smile and seem to hate their life.  Whatever was fun and charming about this place has been lost.  Don't worry, Teakwoods will always be busy because the Applebees crowd is going to continue to flock to this place because the food and prices are excellent. However, the service and vibe has taken a major hit. I would recommend Zipps or Payton's place before Teakwoods.  In terms of watching sports, this isn't a great place. Not all of the TV's are flat screens and nearly all the TV's in that side room have old school TV's with bad reception.  They also don't have common sense in regards to programming. For example, they had the nerve to have soccer playing on several of the TV's during March Madness.",

    "text": "My wife and I rolled in here late yesterday afternoon to meet some of her friends. I dig joints like this as its relaxed and homey feeling. My eye immediately caught the huge vat barrel of salted peanuts at the front door - Score! Nothing like eating peanuts and chucking the shells on the floor or at other people.   Started off with a nice refreshing pint of Guinness which hit the spot and was on special. My wife and I ordered a dozen regular chicken wings to start.And by the way, when did that automatically become the norm to serve ranch with wings. I live for a while near Buffalo in Rotten-chester...eerrrr...Rochester New York and wings are definitely supposed to be served with Blue Cheese as the dipping sauce...I digress.  Anywho, after I ordered I said to myself \"Dam, I forgot to tell her blue cheese\" and not the nasty ranch everyone seems to serve. When the wings arrived they were attractively plump and not dripping in wing sauce, which I find disconcerting, and low and behold there are 2 LARGE ramekins of sauce - one blue cheese and one ranch. Steven Tyler Pj's, Steven Tyler PJ's...nice call Teakwoods. The wings were really good too...I nearly canceled my dinner order and replaced it with more wings (and I should have). Only issue with the wing app there was only 4 measly pieces of celery garnished on the plate.  For dinner, I ordered the Caesar Salad with \"Grilled & Chilled\" shrimp. Sounded good...tasted awful...and for $13 bucks far from a good value. The salad itself wasn't bad but a Caesar should be mostly the hearts of Romaine and not inundated with the leafy crap.  I also overlooked the Caesar faux pas of the red onion rings...but the shrimp was unforgivable. My guess is the 13 dollar price point is based on the fact that it has shrimp in it and apparently the menu description of \"Grilled & Chilled\" shrimp actually in essence means cook a large batch of shrimp and throw them in the cooler until someone orders that salad we serve them in. That pasty mushy old shrimp taste is still in my mouth today...zoiks! Fresh grilled skewer of shrimp off the grill in the salad would have made a HUGE difference AND justified me throwin' down 16 bucks for it, which is how much you figure it costs with the tip. Maybe the owner should watch an episode of Chef Ramsey's \"Kitchen Nightmares,\" in fact any episode, and see how he preaches about the evils of the friggin' lazy cook it all ahead of time method.   My wife has been on Phase 1 of South Beach diet for 2 weeks and was totally cravin' a nice cheeseburger and fires. She was psyched to see sliders on the menu; however, they too were a HUGE disappointment, in fact she didn't even finish them. The bread was not moist and obviously stale, and the meat was dry and tasteless. They screwed up the fries...how do you screw up fries?  She said they were hot but dry and utterly tasteless...dude...some type of seasoning...any seasoning.   Teakwoods did get 3 stars from which otherwise would have been 1 or 2 because the servers were cool and efficient, I liked the vibe, and free peanuts always pull me in like an electro-magnet.   Two parting words of advice for this restaurant \"Fresh Ingredients.\"",

These are now officially my favorite wings in Phoenix (there are some better in NY, but alas I live here now and have to work with what I've got).  I ordered 1 dozen of the hot.  First off, glad to see blue cheese as an option, always a good sign.  Celery and carrots, check.  Good assortment of wings to drums, awesome.  The wings were also a good size with a nice amount of meat on 'em, but not too big.  Best part, the heat was perfect.  Stuck with me for sure, but a good bit of heat while still having great peppery flavor.  Very traditional flavor.  They were nice and crispy, but not overly fried so as to loose some juiciness.  Finally, there was a good bit of sauce on them.  I hate it when there's practically no sauce and I have to ask for an extra side of sauce.  These were coated and just the right amount of sloppy.  Pair that with a good $2 beer and I was a happy girl.",

On the other hand, they have high chairs, a kids menu with a word search, a number tracing picture, and tic tac toe.  There are nine, count'em, nine kid's menu items, and four are vegetarian friendly.  And there is a \"family room\".  I was still not convinced.  The first time I came here there was a party going on in the family room, and it seemed like we were just crammed in the corner of the restaurant.  So my daughter's school had a fundraiser at Teakwoods.  Fifteen percent of the bill went to support the school.  Maybe kid friendly, but still not connived.  Could the school be wrong?  The place was slammed and, at first, I thought we would be waiting for long periods of time for not showing up early, but management was helping pick up the slack and I assume that it was an unusually high volume Monday.  My daughter was a little skeptical about throwing peanuts on the floor, so I'm not sure if that counts as kid friendly.  She would hold out the peanut shell and watch it fall in disbelief.  There is also a video game machine with two classic arcade games, one was Galaga, one of those hutin' shootin' games, and a claw.  I resisted my daughter's urge to spend my money.  And then I noticed that the kids were playing Duck, Duck, Goose on the floor in the family room.  Okay, this places is definitely kid friendly.  How dare you think otherwise.  The wings are great, the beer cold, the Ruben dry, the spaghetti a little light on the sauce, the cups large, the wait staff overwhelmed, why didn't I get wings like last time, and Teakwoods is kid friendly.",

It's a typical neighborhood bar except the theme of this place is that they offer large buckets of shelled peanuts to snack on while you wait for your order and you discard the shells on the ground giving it this dirty shell shavings kinda look. Just a note - if you have a peanut allergy, avoid this place!  anywho since it was lunch when we were there, i ordered myself a Turkey Dip and my friend an Open the Hatch Burger. Side item choices were fries, side salad, fruit, tater tots, onion rings, or sweet potato fries. I got tater tots with mine, and her's with fries.   Service was quick, and the portions huge. The turkey dip was nothing special, quite regular bar food not exceptional and not bad either. Tater tots were crispy and seemed store bought. The burgers are huge and a real mouthful, from what I hear it's ok. Prices are moderate as well. So, anyways if you're looking for a neigborhood bar to watch the game, and looking for a place for a bite to eat, Teakwoods is fine but it's nothing special.",

I really like the atmosphere of this place- it's very versatile. I came here while attending ASU and it was a great place for beer and wings on the cheap. But its also a great place for a casual dinner and they have pretty damn good food for a bar with peanuts on the ground.   I had the Chicken Jack sandwich, which I always get, and it was good. The sweet potato fries I had with it very overwhelmingly spicy, which I didn't like, but I'm sure some people do. Both my parents had burgers and liked them as well.

Upon walking in your greeted by a mass amounts of peanut shells on the floor (personal pet peeve but I'll get over it since it's becoming really popular in restaurants nowadays). The restaurant seems disjointed you enter from the bar side and if you're looking for a more relax feel you walk through an empty door frame to the other side which doesn't seem to match the Bar side of the restaurant. The service is normally friendly but very spotty sometimes I can get a refill, other times it's hard as reading the Grapes of Wrath. By know you're asking why do I even bother? The wings here are just that Damn good! I've had most of the flavors but my favorites are the Jeffe and original hot. The wings are always hot, crispy and saucy (well the ones that are supposed to be)! The salads are nothing to write about but nicely pair with the wings to help cut the fat. The last time I went I had the Zucchini chips and they were hot and crispy yet void of any real flavor, I had to immediately dunked them in  ranch for any satisfaction. Bottom line is as long as this place can satisfy my wing cravings I'll remain a loyal customer. PS- On some weekend nights they have live music.",

    "text": "I had to speak up when I saw the negative reviews this place got for the shooting. Totally unfair. And I wouldn't say that if this place were in any way shady or even mediocre.  I've come here with various groups of friends many times over the years. I've met my lawyer buddies here. I had a friend who worked at Intel and I met her and her Intel buddies here (Intel is actually close by so you'll often run into Intel folks). The typical crowd here is the exact opposite of what comes with the stigma of a freak shooting incident like this.   It gets five stars from me because it delivers on all accounts: good service, good beer specials, good food, and most importantly just a great place to kick back after a long day's work with friends and just have a good time.   Ray and Kyrene is not a bad part of town, folks. Freak shootings can happen anywhere and everywhere. If you're scared of coming here you should definitely stay far far away from downtown Phoenix, Mill Avenue, and every well-known Scottsdale nightclub. Loren Wade anyone?",

Whether it's wings, a burger or my wife's favorite buffalo chicken sandwich, we've been consistently able to count on a quality meal from this place.  Even though we generally get our orders to go, we have made the time on occasion to dine in and have always been happy with the atmosphere and service.   This is your neighborhood bar, not some place that the socialites frequent as part of their weekend bar hopping routine and that is just fine with me. There are plenty of other places to go if you're more interested in the crowd than the bar.   Teakwoods is the place to go when you want something cold on tap, peanuts on the floor, some good wings and an hour or two just hanging out with good friends.",

I always go for dinner and usually after the happy hour is over so it's not that crowded but service is always lacking.    We had a different server each of the last 3 times we went and all of them need to learn the basics because they didn't have a clue.  Our drinks would usually take about 15 minutes to make it to us and our food orders were wrong for 2 out of 3 people at our table.  I had to ask for a side of ranch 3 times before it finally showed up and by that time, about 15 minutes, my food was cold and the other 2 people that were seated with me had finished their food.    Finally we decided to leave and asked for our bills.  It took 4 tries before she got the bills correct.  Each time she would put someones food with another persons drinks and totals were off.  We kept repeating what each of us had ordered but she would just interrupt and say that she knew what it was and would fix it.  Four tries later she got it right.  Believe it or not, no exaggeration, it took us about 25 minutes to pay the bill because she kept making mistakes.    On a good note the food is usually very good, I like the peanuts at the table, and it's a great place to watch the games.  I feel that the management in this place needs to pay more attention to what is going on. The prices I've noticed have gone up but the quality of service has definitely gone down.  I think I'm gonna give Teakwoods a break for a while and see what other sports bars in the area have to offer.  Time to start searching Yelp for a new spot :)",

Lots of TVs, pretty busy on game nights, and there's a patio.  The best part? Kids were sat on the restaurant side. Woohoo!  As for the food, just embrace the whole peanuts on the floor thing. Really. It was hard for me to chuck them on the floor, too, but it's not really a reason to dock a star... The food and service will take care of that for you, because it's as casual as the atmosphere.   The service was just a bit slow and sloppy. Hubby was given the wrong sandwich,so I shared half of my turkey ruben with him. It was a fine sandwich--not great, but not bad. Hence the 3 stars! His cheesesteak came back out looked really yummy but the cheese sauce just didn't have any flavor. My Blue Moons were excellent. :)  So if you want a fun, casual night out, just don't go with high expectations and I think you'll be just fine!",

Anyway, you gotta love a place where there's peanuts in the shell on every table and you can order breakfast any time of day...or night.  How many sports bars serve breakfast anyway?  Despite the numerous plasma/LCD televisions, sometimes Teaks gives off more of a family restaurant vibe than that of a sports bar.  There are a lot of little kids in there on days and nights and it seems to be a popular post-game venue for parents following Corona del Sol home games.   Food is good, portions are large and the variety is awesome. That alone will bring in people of any age.   One thing I cannot understand is why, with so many great televisions, the place would rather play the stereo than put the volume on when there are games on.  During an NFL game recently it took them about a quarter to get the volume restored on the second half of the Giants/Eagles game (rather than switching to the local feed) and on one busy college football Saturday a spaghetti western popped on one screen.  Still, I can live with Sergio Leone, football and eggs.",

My wife's tacos consisted of overcooked fish nuggets. We had mozzarella sticks for an appetizer and they weren't cooked enough. A very disappointing meal all around.

The waiter said they were better than the mozzarella sticks, and I do believe we made the right choice to get them. I didn't try the mozzarella sticks, but I didn't need to. These cheese curds were rad.   Our friends ordered the wings with honey hot sauce. They were good wings. I'm more of a medium girl myself, so I didn't eat many of them. The flavor was good though.   My girlfriend and I split the cheeseburger sliders. They come with three sliders and your choice of side (fries, tator tots, etc). We got the tator tots to complete the meal. The waiter knew we were splitting it, so our food came out on two separate plates. One of the sliders was even cut in half for us. It was nice of them do that for us. Sharing on one plate is always so annoying.   They had drink specials going on, so we got vodka drinks. They also had $5 house wine, so we tried a glass of the pinot grigio. Not very good, but it was $5. It is what it is.   The entire experience was pretty nice. The food was good, and the drink specials were on point.",

Our waitress was super nice, but also had ZERO knowledge about the menu... including the soup of the day. We blindly ordered as all she would say when asked a questions was... \"it's a popular item\" OR \"people tend to like it\"... cool, but I want a more in-depth description.  Do you inform the staff of the daily specials? Let them test it out?   That is all :). Thanks!",

Incidentally enough, Teakwoods was always in competition with my favorite place on the west side for best wings!   Wings taste almost the same. That same fantastic deep fried fully cooked vinegary wing with buffalo sauce.   My favorite is the medium wings, however hubs and our friend loves the Hot.   Definitely try the Suicide if you're into hot stuff, but know you're gonna tell that toilet who's boss later on. Flushable baby wipes.  You're welcome.   The beer deals and salads and the ambiance is pretty cool.   Not super busy... more of a middle aged crowd. They do have a baby changing table in the family bathroom on the family side, FYI. I was told by a young server that she didn't think they had one... no, they do.  Can't blame her... before I had kids I didn't think about it either.   This is my favorite wing place! Will always go back.",

I would definitely order it again, given the chance.  My lady friend ordered the beef stroganoff, which was perfect an the gentleman had some kind of tasty burger. I forget the toppings but it spoke well of the quality of the burgers here, I would confidently recommend their burgers The staff was attentive but not overbearing.they weren't busy so we camped out for a bit, during which time our waitress happily refilled our drinks.  After I left I realized I lost my headphones. The staff kindly helped me look and took my number in case they turned up,and suggested I check the parking lot.  There were my headphones, under my car! The staff were happy to hear I had found them. All's well that ends well!",

Like I'm going to eat something that nobody knows whats in it? I emailed Teakwoods, too and spoke with a woman who said she'd let me know about the contents of the veggie burger. After a week or so and no response I sent another email. No response.   +1 cheap drinks +1 for peanuts -2 for half-assed and rude service.",

    "text": "Despite any bad or lower rated reviews, of which there are a few, this place was bustling with business last night.    Occasionally (like all the time), I'm a tad opinionated on where I'd like to be seated.  Never by the restroom, preferably a booth, and not crammed next to another group if there are more comfortable open spaces available.  This has more to do with my personal preferences and less to do with this review but I just felt I'd throw it out there.    I asked to be seated up on the raised level just north of the bar when the waitress began to lead us to a table on the floor level.  It was no big deal, she accommodated us easily.  Happy Hour up until 7pm, I believe.  $2 domestic drafts.  My wife got a Blue Moon for $2.50 and I had iced tea.  We also had an order of a dozen hot wings and fried cheese curds.   This place is definitely a bar serving bar food.  Every plate that I saw delivered to a customer looked pretty tasty and piled high with food.  I saw some super looking Nachos, a huge burger with a pile of fries, somebody even had what looked like a burger patty with a side of cottage cheese and fruit.  Even that looked good.  Our server wasn't the most attentive but he got our drinks out pretty fast and when our food hit the table (brought out by a different server) he was there to refill my iced tea and to bring my wife another beer.  You can't really ask for much more in a bar.  The wings were great.  We didn't order suicide but instead opted for hot and they were okay.  Not super hot but not super mild.  The cheese curds were new to both of us and they were okay.  Sort of just like breaded, fried chewier cheese but none the less tasty.  In the end we paid $22 bucks for two beers, two apps and an iced tea.  Not bad.    Oh yeah, you're supposed to just throw the peanut shells on the floor after eating them.  This felt weird for some reason even considering that the floor was covered with peanut shells.",

    "text": "Out of a dozen visits, its still a tossup if I'd recommend it. The service, food, and ambiance varies greatly from day to day and also lunch to dinner.  The good: - This is where I come for wings. They have a great selection of flavors & sauces, and after having wings elsewhere, I came back to Teakwoods. Generally, the wings are big, juicy, and slathered with sauce. -Daily specials, always something new -Peanuts at your table while you wait -TV screens everywhere -Live music on the weekends -Occasionally they offer Groupon deals- $15 for $30 of food? Yes please! -Happy hour specials (though I've never once made it here during their selected times)  The bad: -Drinks. Both alcohol and nonalcoholic drinks here leave much to be desired.    * The bartender has a very weak pour on their daily specials, so what looks like a good deal at $3.50 a glass will end up taking you 2x as many drink orders as normal.   * I think they use tap water for their teas and drinking water. It taste so horrible, I've had to send drinks back several times and I just don't order them now. If you are thirsty, get a soda. -Food quality during lunch hour. You'll have better luck around dinnertime, but slower service. Lunches here have been disappointing about 50% of the time.  -During sports games, you do NOT want to bring your family here, even if its right after church. It will be super crowded and don't be surprised if you are seated next to a boisterous, foulmouthed gang of disrespectful adults who scream their heads off every goal. -Prices jumped 15% after they got voted 'Best of Phoenix' for their wings.",

    "text": "I made my first foray into this establishment yesterday and was surprised by what I found. I don't know why, but the title of the restaurant had me envisioning stuffy people reinventing the hot wing. That's not what I found. Instead, I was treated to a down to earth bar and grill with food that tasted the way it should.  The sandwich board out front as well as numerous signs on the walls and tabletop informed me of the unbelievable number of special drink deals this place offers. I'd be astonished if someone showed up any day of the week and couldn't find a cocktail or beer they'd enjoy at a discounted price.  I ordered the hot wings and, while I wasn't blown away, they tasted as they should and were just hot enough. After relaxing with a couple beers, we ordered the soft pretzels which were fantastic. If your biggest complaint with a pretzel is that it's tied up, Teakwoods is for you. We received long strips of buttered pretzels (is it really a pretzel if it's straight? A discussion better left to a different forum) with a bowl of cheese dipping sauce.  As has been mentioned dozens of times in other reviews, they offer buckets of peanuts and allow the shells to hit the floor. This may sound fun, but as my date said \"I feel bad for throwing this on the floor.\" Ok, maybe that's just her. The place is fun, the food is good,  and the price is great.",

The atmosphere is kind of uninviting it's dark and has peanut shells all over the place and I almost slipped on some once and I imagine after a couple drinks even though you may not feel the fall it's still not something I want to worry about. Anyway the service is nice and the food is reasonably priced  and it's in a pretty good location.",

This location has a relatively large bar area and a side for the family as well.  I like it so much, last year I had my family meet their for my bday.  It was a Friday night and we showed up late to do trivia. We had a blast!  I'm not sure when it happened but my wife and I have gotten in a routine of splitting an order of medium boneless bites and a Teak-A-Dilla with Chicken.  It is an amazing meal and we take a lot of it home, so the portion sizes are large.  The food is great here, every now and then, I'll get a burger and they are amazing, you can't go wrong.

The burgers we ordered were good. My big problem was with the beef stroganoff that was ordered. Simply awful. We told the waitress, but she appeared to be uninterested, and didn't offer to make it better. Not even an apology. They still charged us $15.99 for it, to boot. Oh well, good and bad.  On a positive note, management contacted me after my initial review. Impressive.",

It's pretty pricey here.   So we started with traditional wings medium flavor. Also we got cheese curds and it comes with jalapeno ranch dressing. The jalapeno ranch dressing gives it a kick and taste good. The cheese curds and wings were good.   I got the cheeseburger with steak fries and it was good. My sister got the chicken Mac Mac, it wasn't good. My brother got the philly melt it was okay. My brother got the perfect pita it's like a gyro. He said if you ate other gyros before, this is not the best one.   There's a patio outside. There's like half table tops with a bar and the other half with booths and lower tables. The booths are so low. The bar side bathroom smells so bad like a sewer. Also there's a lot of peanut crumbs on the floor.",

Honestly, everything is so delicious there and I have always had great service, as well. There is alsman, nicknamed Rojo, who works there who has to be the nicest and hardest working man in Phoenix!

He said it was the best burger he's had in a long time. Fries were shoestring-like but not too crunchy. I got the Tex Mex salad which our server said was huge and offered to serve me half of it and put the other half right in a to-go container, separating the warm meat into another container to keep the lettuce from wilting. The half salad was just the right amount. Salad was delicious with romaine, taco flavored shredded chicken (warm), tortilla strips, guacamole and jalapeno ranch. Shared the half baked chocolate chip cookie for dessert. It was a large gooey cookie topped with 2 scoops of vanilla ice cream and chocolate drizzle. Would have preferred the cookie to be fully baked for a crunchy texture.",

Cheeseburger Lavosh is a major surprise: light crispy thin breading holds a mix of all the favorite meat and veggies that are normally part of a otherwise heavy burger. Wings are just fantastic thanks to the additional grilling.  Meatloaf with garlic mashed... I could go on and on. Management is actively setting up specials and discounts so take advantage of the Android/Apple app. Let's not forget the staff: always friendly and great to talk to. They make this a wonderful place to relax, toss down some brews and watch some games.",

Our bill was almost $50 for a sandwich, dozen wings, salad, and cup of chili. We didn't order alcohol this time.",

I wrote a review about Teakwwods several years back regarding its decline. Well, it hasn't gotten any better and now THEY INCREASED THEIR PRICES AS IF YOU'RE AT A RESORT IN SCOTTSDALE... $16 for wings, $16 for a Flipping Chuck Burger, or basically any burger, $11 for cheese sticks, $24 flipping dollars for a average Lavash Pizza, I asked for a side of sauce for my wings and the waitress said to me that'll be 75 cents! I swear I think the owner must be using this place as a front or he just wants it to fail and be done with it.  THE BATHROOMS ARE EFFEN DISGUSTING, PLAIN DISGUSTING!! They SMELL LIKE A PORTA POTTY and they try to cover the smell with perfume like smell... SHAME ON THE OWNER!! I WILL NEVER, EVER STEP FOOT IN THIS PLACE AGAIN!!!!!.. IF YOU DONT BELIEVE ME GO SEE FOR YOURSELF.. I guarantee you will not return... Better yet, pull up their menu and look at the INSANE, RIDICULES HIGH PRICES... SAVE YOUR HARD EARNED MONEY AND AT LEAST GO TO ZIPPS or somewhere else..",

Place was dead and the waitress (who was very attentive) handed us a laminated copy of their \"wing surcharge\". Apparently there has been some scourge of lost chickens that is driving up prices so they add a surcharge to every wing order. Conspiracy? Perhaps the Chic-fil-a cows perpetrated the biggest chicken heist in US History but thankfully the conspiracy hasn't hit Nebraska yet. Thank you Strategic Air Command for keeping our chickens safe. Come on Teakwoods. Let's do the math. A pound of wings is between 7-12 wings. The cost of a pound of wings has gone up, according to the WSJ, by .58 a pound. Yet to recoup your \"costs\" you add a surcharge of $3. Nice little additional profit, bad idea.",

That's right the floor, so you can imagine this is not the most elegant place.   Every night has some drink specials and a decent selection of beers as a good bar should. The food is well executed bar style menu expect to see your cheese laden and fried foods.   I brought a friend here who had a particularly bad week and day, I did not think anything could cheer her up. After pounding on half a bucket of peanuts, her frustration was gone.",

The burgers are always juicy, the cheese curds will never do you wrong, and the fries in any style are great. They also have a really good selection of beer, and who wouldn't like that? The atmosphere is quintessential sports bar. The Tv's are always running the sport of the season. There are peanut shells on the floor(even to this day I love crushing them underfoot) and it's loud. But its the \"Everyone having a good time and enjoying themselves\" loud. Also every employee I have ever encountered at Teakwoods has been super friendly and attentive. If you've never been I definitely suggest that you give them a try, because I know you'll fall in love.",

First off, you cannot beat shelled peanuts that you are allowed to throw on the floor...I've always thought that was very cool.  The food has changed over the years, but they still do some pretty great bar and grill grub.  Their shoestring fries with hot cheese is to die for.  So are their wings, onion rings, fried zucchini, soft baked pretzels, and Chicken Jack (Not Jill) sandwiches. The atmosphere has changed over the years, as well as the service and attitude.  It's kind of hit or miss now.  You might get both great food and service, but it's a 50-50 shot that the service or food might be sub par.

No seriously, when you walk in there is a huge bushel of peanuts, and you can get as much as you want! Done with the shells? Just leave them on the table then brush them aside. The end result? A restaurant with peanut shells all over the place. Actually, to be quite honest, I'm being a little harsh here. I thought it was cool that they did this unlimited free peanuts thing, but it was like they were trying to compensate for something else.  Well, when I got my food I figured out what they were trying to compensate for. The salad and 'breadsticks' were just plain bad. However, I didn't really expect much. I was actually hoping my wings would be good and that the salad was just a side. The wings are nothing special at all. I thought the 'El Hefe' wings were somewhat decent, but I don't think I could have more than a half-dozen of those. Hot wings? What hot wings? I thought I ordered some, but maybe the waiter got confused. I got some cold wings with red sauce on them, they tasted 'vinegary' and that's about all.  To be fair, the service was pretty good and the server was friendly. She was helping us make decisions since it was our first time, but the food was cold on multiple occasions. A previous reviewer mentioned gorgeous staff... Not quite sure why you would prefer that instead of good food, go to a strip club? Maybe if the food was hot it could be different, but I really doubt it since the recipes here are just way off the mark.  There is really nothing special about this place. The wings are over priced for what you get, and there is better stuff available 5 minutes away from here. I love wings, and I've been trying so hard to find a good wing place in Phoenix, but I think my search continues for the time being.",

We ordered sliders and wings, two pitchers of beer....over $100 bucks when all was said and done.  The food looked great, but was cold and really substandard.  On an \"up\" side, the waitress was really nice, but appeared to be the only server on duty. I'm sure this accounted for the cold food.  I say if you want to be great, be great every night, including Mondays.",

I said please put us down we have small children. He sighed and said \"whats your name\"  I then said whats your name\"  He said Brad I'm the bartender.  We were comparing it to the Teakwoods that closed down in our town :(. We were disappointed to say the least. I ordered a burger \"medium rare\" the burger was cooked \"rare\". My husband and I both had an  upset stomache after eating here. I'm rating it a 2 because our server was good (still took care of him), & our kids had fun with the laid back atmosphere with throwing peanut shells. It's too bad the food and attitude from the \"bar tender\" didn't sit well with us .",

We were here from out of town, and because we were there with our 11-year old son, they sat us in what seemed to be the \"family\" room adjacent to the main bar area; fine. The entire place seemed to be the choice for the local crowd, and the family room was jammed with parents toting small kids. It makes sense, given that young adults have few places they can really go out and take the kiddos. Everybody seemed to feel at home with toddlers running about, crunching peanut shells under their feet. Don't take this description as a derision; it just is what it is. If you're looking for a roantic dinner choice with your SO, this may not be the place.    Everybody enjoyed their meals, and the staff might be the most attentive I have ever experienced. Try their take on macaroni and cheese, it's amazing.",

It wasn't over crowded and we pretty much got a whole area to ourselves. My husband and I ordered boneless wings in 2 flavors. They were ok, but several pizza delivery places can beat them. My father in law got a bowl of chili and said it was terrible.  Our fried zucchini was so over fried it was almost black. Luckily the waiter agreed to take them off our bill. Unluckily he only came to check on us once after we got our food, probably 20 mins into eating. I had to venture to the bar for extra average settings and my hubs 2nd beer. I gave 2 stars instead of 1 because if we had a better waiter I think that would have helped.",

I love that little salty snack before a meal while I'm enjoying a cold beer.  They have great drink and food specials everyday and a specialty beer that is always a good price.  We love the nachos because they are absolutely loaded!  Teakwoods is a great place to watch a game because there are TV's everywhere you look.  I would love if they offered more craft beer because the selection is limited.",

    "text": "This is by far my favorite place to get some decent wings. Working in San Jose all the time, I've struggled to find a good wing place. Smoke Eaters isn't bad, but it pales in comparison to this place... The service here is usually top notch. Although sometimes they get really busy and you end up having to wait a bit, but that's with any decent restaurant... The fact that they are always busy should tell you that the food and beer is pretty damn good. I haven't really tried any of the other food here besides the wings... Although my wife said that their sliders are pretty good as well. As for the atmosphere, it's noisy, fun, and you get to throw peanuts and peanut shells at your friends, or on the floor... whichever.  So, some friendly advice... If you like REALLY spicy wings, get the Suicide wings... The flavor is great, and they have one hellofa kick! If you like a little bit of heat with a LOT of flavor, get the El Heffe wings. They are delicious and have a wonderful garlicy flavor. Usually I get half El Heffe and half Suicide...  The other wings here are delicious as well, just depends on your tastes and how spicy you want them.",

This is absolutely a joke I called around to their competitors and they said there is absolutely no upcharge on chicken wings or shortage LMAO. they flat-out lied to you if they had a negative five star I would  definitely give that to them. THEY SUCK I know times are tough but don't screw the public that supports your local neighborhood business",

I usually like honey hot but their Jess Jess is outstanding even if it is a bit on the mild side. On top of the wings, the staff is always friendly and attentive. That combined with plenty of TV's and free peanuts makes for a great all around sports bar.",

The food came out nice and quick and taste spectacular! and as always I have to get my kilt lifter beer to go with my hot wings of course! my wife loves the garden burger opposed to the turkey sliders she always gets... Unfortunately they were out of prickly pear for the margaritas so my wife had to get a Jamaican 10 speed instead which was great in all except it cost $2 extra... Maybe next time... But all in all it is a great place great environment",

We have the El Jefe wings boneless. When it came, we were disappointed because it looked like a dry rub but man but it pack in some flavor. I would def. recommend that if this is your first time here.",
