    "text": "If you enjoy being taken for an idiot and eating mediocre food in a nice atmosphere with cool music, this is the place to go.  First, the restaurant is very charming with its old garage like style, and they play good music (Smashing Pumpkins made the lunch more pleasant). That, unfortunately, is almost the only positive thing I can say.  We ordered a Coke and an iced tea, and we got - a diet coke. We notified the waitress and she brought a new one and explained in detail how the soda machine doesn't really work at the moment. No problem, but the explanation did not make much sense to us. Admit that it was a mistake, say sorry, and everything would be okay. We got some chips and salsa for free and they were tasty.  For food we got a shrimp burrito with Guacamole (that we asked to have inside the burrito) and the Diablo Chicken Salad. Guess what, the burrito came with the Guacamole on the side and, for whatever reason, the salad that goes into a burrito also on the side. Husband said it tasted okay.  My chicken salad however, where do I start... it was supposed to be the grilled chicken with Diablo sauce, sesame seeds, edamame, kale, avocado and dressing. It was entirely lettuce, a few lonely edamame, three slices of avocado with some brown spots, pretty dry chicken, and not a single piece of kale. The one great thing was the Diablo sauce which was fruity, sweet and really spicy. I notified the waiter about the lack of kale, she left the table and came back with a menu and said there's no kale in the salad, it says \"edamame kale\" and edamame kale are the few tiny beans in the salad. I highly doubted that there is something like edamame kale but who knows, nowadays everything suddenly comes in new fancy varieties, so maybe there is an edamame kale that looks and tastes like normal edamame. We googled immediately - guess what, there is no such thing as edamame kale. Nice try fooling the customer. We looked at the menu again and it clearly says it has edamame and kale. Seriously, if she had told me they're out of kale, ok, or they forgot it, ok. But making up a ridiculous new vegetable that doesn't exist... come on.... I almost threw a Gordon Ramsey in that place, but I'll get my revenge now with this review [insert evil laughter here].  So, I paid $12 for a bowl of lettuce and a good laugh about \"edamame kale\"...  To make a long story short, the food is a joke, especially for the prices and the waitress lies in your face instead of admitting even minor mistakes. We will definitely never come back.",

    "text": "To be clear: I did not eat at Sir Veza's The Big Restaurant Attached To The Mall. I ate at Sir Veza's Taco Garage The Place In The Food Court Because I'm Cheap.  I'm not a business analyst, but what it looks like they've done is built their restaurant right next to the food court, so they share a wall, and then carved out one of the food court sections so now it's like the restaurant has a closet that they take orders from and bring you food. You can sit there, in the food court, with the rest of the food court eaters. The food wasn't super fast, which is great because that makes me believe they are making it fresh, and \"ho doggy\" it did seem to be pretty fresh. It wasn't slow either though. I didn't feel like I was sitting around waiting or anything. It took the appropriate amount of time.  I ordered a Sir Noran Hot Dog or something like that. I think the name is supposed to be a play on words because the name of the place starts with 'Sir', but I don't get it. It doesn't really matter though. I'm ok if they want to call it that. Anyway, I ordered it, and it was delicious. If you like hotdogs, you'll either like this, or you're a liar.  The ambiance of the food court in general is a wonderfully grounding experience. One of the things I love about the Chandler Fashion Square Mall is how diverse the shoppers are. You can sit in the food court for an hour, and absolutely make things up, and they'll inevitably walk through the place. Ugly kid on stilts. Totally overweight woman with 3 children. Guy who looks like the monopoly guy. Just any kind of person.  Overall I'm giving Sir Veza's Taco Garage a total of four freakin' stars, because the food was delicious, and the service was great, but compared to the cool taco-garage feel of the counter, going back and sitting in the mall food court means you don't get that full-on Sir Veza's experience. Well then, why did I eat at the food court instead of going to the restaurant? Well I'm not a genius, so I don't know. 4 stars is still really good, so don't worry about it.",

I, who ordered off of the regular menu, was able to choose from about 8-10 different fillers for my tacos.  I chose the shredded chicken and the carne asada which is a dollar more.  The shredded chicken was really good, but I wouldn't recommend the carne asada--too dry and small chunks of steak.  (Maybe I'm not a carne asada fan.)  They let me get more beans because I don't eat white rice.  I also liked that I could get charro beans (but not the kind I'm used to) instead of refried beans.

Yelp'd it and... What? A 4-star place here? Their food shall be had. Onward!  The concept is a garage restaurant-- garage decor, mechanics rags for napkins, staff in biker apparel, et al.  Cool look and vibe, along with lots of TVs to catch the games on while eating.  Menu is mainly tacos, salads, and a big sonoran hot dog. That latter was yummy as bucks. And the kids menu hit the spot with our little girls.   A bit slow on the service and the young lady kept forgetting things in her rush. She was nice enough though and I forgive her attempt to give me diabetes with an Arnold Palmer so sweet that my relations felt the pucker. She's young and with some additional experience, she'll be rocking it.  We'll be back!",

    "text": "Just opened up at the Chandler mall, you'll find this sports bar at the food court entrance.  The menu is written in car jargon and difficult to understand,  but our server was polite and helped explain the different items. Food and drinks were over priced. The happy hour specials are closer to normal prices.  Seating was...interesting. The dining area is mostly outside and set up like a bar rather than a restaurant. There is also a 'lounge' area with cushioned benches and coffee tables. At the dining tables, you get either a bench seat, stool, or horribly uncomfortable chair. I had to swap out my chair for a stool shortly after being seated, and I noticed another lady also opting for a different seat.  I have to say, after seeing the high prices I was prepared to dislike this place, but we really got our value for the food we ordered. Three of us shared a full order of nachos with chicken, and it was super huge and we all loved it. Just for the nachos, I would come here again. Seriously, this thing was served on a baker's 1/4 sheet and was 8\" high!!  Service was a mixed experience but mostly good. At one point I went inside for something I needed. I surely had an I-need-help look on my face but thought there were employees everywhere,  they were so focused on watching the game on TV I had trouble getting someone's attention. In a few minutes I got sorted out and went back to the mountain of nachos at my table.  Overall a good experience.",

Ordered the Stuffed Chipotle Chicken (chipotle cream, corn tamale stuffed, poblano) with a side of calabacitas and black beans. SO delicious!!!   I came here during the lunch hour and our waitress Christin was friendly and knowledgable. Also, the food came out very quick and perfect for a lunch rush.   Didn't get an opportunity to try any of the cocktails, but they seem to have a great Happy Hour menu with cheap drinks and eats. We'll be sure to come here for Happy Hour soon.   They have only been open for 4 months and are having their Grand Opening at the end of March. Get in before it gets too busy, because this place is going to be rockin' in no time.   Gracias Sir Veza!!!!",

I ordered the club taco and the Diablo chicken taco,  and I got  a plain chicken taco and a Diablo shrimp taco.  Both were really good though,  and I didn't even mention it to the waitress.    We also had the Margarita of the month that has coconut in it,  which was delicious!!    The food was a little slow to come out,  especially for a Thursday,  but thankfully we weren't in any hurries.    Overall,  it was good food and drink.  I would absolutely give them another try",

    "text": "Location: it is located in the Chandler mall. It has outdoor and indoor seatings close to the main food court. General areas are relatively clean and organized. However, this restaurant is more family oriented and I probably will not recommend it for a date night.   Service: it is 120% excellence. The owner basically greed us at the door while we were reviewing the menu. The waitress is super friendly and attentive. After we were seated, the owner still comes back to check up on us from time to time.   Food: we ordered shrimp ceviche as an appetizer. They put too much lime on it and it was a bit too soar. For main entree, I ordered the Soroman hotdog and it was absolutely delicious. The owner told me he moved out here from Tuson and I'm glad that they bought my favorite hotdog down here with him. I wanted to order the churrios for dessert but I was completely full at that point.   Rating: I gave it a 3 stars because (1) the comment about the appetizer and (2) their menus are a bit pricy. I might come back here again to get the hotdog. Overall, I think this restaurant is average.",

Kids meals are served in a compartmentalized tray, which is great for mine who don't like their different foods to touch. They have a wide variety of tacos, and I enjoyed each one I ordered - the short rib, the shrimp with sriracha; and the fish. However, I would definitely skip the table-side prepared guacamole for $10 - it was basically four lumpy avocados thrown together with some other minor ingredients mixed in. It was not terrible; just very bland and not worth the price. I liked the ambience of the place with the indoor/outdoor seating; and they had a DJ playing music outside on the patio on Saturday night. Like others have said, service was not great, but it certainly wasn't the worst I've had either...I assume this will get better with time. My family and I will be back to try out some different menu items, and to enjoy another cold MX brew out on the patio.",

Service was so bad that I regretted not going to a much higher class facility such as Del Taco or Taco Bell. Salsa was poor and when I asked for another type the original waiter said did have options  (a young employee said they had a hot \"salsa\" she brings in a \"taste\" less than 1/4 teaspoon - more of a warm vinegary pesto - I thought maybe better on fish tacos so I ordered. She disappeared never to return. After finishing 2 of the 3 bland tacos another employee walked by I requested \"that\" salsa she came back with approximately 1 tablespoon in a metal container that resembled a 1/ 2 of a shot glass it was less than 1/2 full. Again, poor service.  The waiter, a young man finally showed up saying he had 5 tables and was busy out in a he main room gave us the bill - in excess of $30 for 3 fish tacos and a chicken chimichanga with 2 waters that were never refilled. The room we were in was suppose to be cool, I guess if high eighties or low 90's is acceptable then it was nearing their requirements.  The music was so loud you had to yell across your table to hear each other.  I made a mistake eating there thinking quality food based on reviews but will never again frequent and will highly discourage others from wasting time or money.",

Food was okay (at the time*), but nothing to write home about.  Late-night happy hour specials (appetizers) were reasonable; normal prices compared to the food we got would be a bit high.  And if you wonder why the \"at the time\" comment, it's because I spent a significant amount of time on the toilet the next morning.

Sat down inside, kind of cool looking place but theme was a little confusing. Menu was an eyesore with the very different names for simple menu items. We both had a corona, almost not cold enough but not warm enough to complain about. Then we  both ordered carne asada burritos, mine was normal: hers was enchilada style. Server brings only my food out, then soon after hers came out. I take a bite of my burrito and I'm suddenly biting into a breakfast burrito. Server realizes mistake then comes and takes the plate back then has the nerve to go back to other table and grabs my order and tells me she cut it open but didn't take a bite. WHAT?? Why would i want food that has been cut open by someone else? Waited for food even though we were borderline gonna be late for our movie. Her food is now cold but I finally get my \"new\" burrito. So now we're rushed to finish. Both burritos were a little bland, hers was a bit more flavorful with the added sauce. Very Overpriced for quality of food. 15 dollars for a carne asada burrito? with no sides? The music was not good, way too loud, and clashes with the theme in my opinion. And the purpose of the uniform is to make sure the entire business/company looks equal/unified. Make the cook take off his \"du-rag\" and obnoxious hat. Just looks bad. I really hope this place turns it around because there is a glimmer of potential.",

She recommended the enchiladas and nachos. My husband and dad ordered the enchiladas and I ordered the nachos. The enchiladas came in a scalding hot iron pan and appeared to be a soup since the small Enchiladas were drowning in a sea of red sauce. You seriously couldn't even see them. No one mentioned the skillet they came in was very hot when the food was delivered and my father burned his fingers to the blistering point by touching it to move his platter around. My nachos were ordered with the carnitas which was cold and unappetizing. And I had a bout of food poisoning the next morning.   As a newcomer to the Chandler area I was looking forward to a fun and delicious meal at Sir Vezas. Let me just say, this was my first and last visit there.",

This was my second visit came here a while back for some drinks and had a pleasant experience I figured we'd stop again and this time try some tacos.  Place wasn't busy my any means as there were tables open. We sat at the bar top.    The bar top was filthy, food crumbs and dirty glasses everywhere not just where we were sitting.  The bar tender came and I thought he'd wipe the top down. Nope my mistake for thinking he would do it without me having to ask.   I look over to the end of the bar and the entire corner was evidently conquered by an army of dirty dishes, pint glasses, plates, and pitchers.  The bar tender just went about his business taking orders and ignoring the mess. He brought us our beers and once again didn't even make an attempt to wipe away the previous three meals that were all over the top.    My desire to eat quickly faded, as I wondered if they were this messy out in the open I can only imagine how filthy they are behind the scenes.     Such a disappointment as this place has potential and I like the garage decor and feel.  But I will never go back to a place that blatantly disregards cleanliness.",

I feel like this restaurant hasn't been given enough credit.    We arrived mid-day on a Sunday after a few hours of shopping.  The beer was cold and the wine was nice.  The chips and salsa was very flavorful and great to take the edge off our hunger.  Our waitress was very helpful and friendly and recommended the tacos to us.    My husband had the cerveza battered fish, the shredded beef and diablo shrimp tacos along with rice and beans.  He had both corn and flour tortillas.  The tacos were very generous in size and they used two tortillas per taco (they were smaller).  The flavor was very good for each of the proteins and cooked well.  I had the diablo shrimp and shredded chicken on a lettuce wraps, which was a nice option for a person who likes to each low carb and watches their macros.    Overall, the place had a fun atmosphere, the service was good and the food was flavorful. We would come here again and recommend that people give it a try!",

The service  It is nice to eat a restaurant and have a server who knows about the menu and what it tastes like.  We got great info when placing our drink order and then our food order.  We never waited a minute if we needed something.  The chips and salsa were replaced when they got low.      The atmosphere   We ate outside under the large mall entry way covering.  It was comfortable and was good for people watching in the background.  I did mention we ate here on a Monday night and the large screen television allowed us to watch some of the game(even though we both didn't like the teams playing LOL)    The food  I went with a 3 taco plate and tried 3 different tacos.  It was served with beans and rice.  All three were good and my favorite was the diablo shrimp taco.  My wife had the grilled chicken enchilada flat.  We both thought the food was very great.  I was just able to \"just' finish everything on my plate and my wife wasn't.  We both left full!    Overall  Having been to the Tucson locations this new one in Chandler is on par with the others.  I had a great tasting margarita and enjoyed the chips and salsa while waiting for our food.  When the food arrived it tasted great.  The automotive garage theme they have going on works.  Outside dining and the ability to watch the game worked.  With the amount of quality food and drink we got the price worked.  If you find yourself wanting Mexican food while at the mall give it a try.  It will not be the typical mall fast food and the quality here will be much better!",

We got our tacos with no meat in them and one had French fries or something in them as of the kitchen was a mess. We finally got the food runner to acknowledge us and take it back. She brought back our tacos with meat slopped in it and the tortillas were cold and getting hard. This place was amazing prior to this possible new management or the Sunday kitchen staff sucks which all the staff should be on the same standard. I will try this place one more time until I tell it to fuck off.",

They sat us at a small table with no view of the very few TV's in the restaurant. We took it upon ourselves to sit in a better view area. And then were told that the table was reserved, but would only be relocated once they showed up. They never showed. As for the service, it was super slow. It seemed like we were the last table to get service and if we needed anything we waited forever for staff to come back around. We even went up to the bar to order our own drinks. What made it even worse is there was a group of fruit flies flying around a few tables that made it disgusting to eat or be around. I ordered a micheladas, worst one I have ever tasted. They use like the premixed lime juice, which tasted like margarita mix, no clamato. I reordered for a mojito and the same mix was used! Drinks are horrible!!! Order a beer to be safe. I would not go back nor recommend this place.",

I ordered the Carne Asada burrito for $12.95. It only came with lettuce and a small amount of pico de gallo. Additional add ons were extra for the burrito. Burrito contained dry steak, black beans, cheese, and rice mixed with bean mixture. The filling was very dry and not very good to me. I had to eat some of my husband's fries. We also had the complimentary chips and salsa. The chips were all broken up into small pieces, like the bottom of the bag chips. The salsa was good. I had to pour it over my burrito to make it taste better.",

I also ordered a second marg at happy hour, a strawberry marg on the rocks. Also delicious.  We ordered the chimi bites and the $2 tacos on Tuesday. The chimi bites were amazing. The $2 tacos....not so much. I was almost full when I got them, but I thought they lacked flavor. I want to try some of the regular plate tacos next time because those sounded really great. The \"new\" shredded beef or chicken tacos look delicious.  For the price and the variety of specials, this place is a good find!",

My husband ordered 2 street tacos which were greasy (they had been grilled with cheese unlike most street tacos) and served with mediocre sides of black beans and rice.  My meal was the most tolerable, but only because I requested no cheese or dairy of any kind.  I had to wait longer as they remade my meal, because they made a mistake and originally put cheese on it.  I also had a margarita, which was watered down.  Given the poor food quality, I don't expect this restaurant to last much longer than others that have been at the spot.  But if you are at the mall and looking for \"Mexican\" food, I suggest Rubio's - it's much better than this place.",

    "text": "Eh...3...3.5.  My husband had been here a couple of times for happy hour with coworkers and mentioned that I should give it a try.  I liked it more than I thought I would, but a couple of things kept it from being more stars.  We were there on 6/27 for happy hour.  Our server, Cristianna, was nice and generally efficient at circling back around to check on us.  We each ordered a $3 HH margarita and got those pretty quickly.  I didn't have high expectations for a 3-dollar margarita, and it was just that...a cheap margarita.  I ordered another one I think for only 2 reasons:  it was hot out and they were 3 bucks, but I really didn't enjoy them and they gave me heartburn.  Meh.    I ordered the 1 and only combo with the jalopy taco and that was a tasty dish.  It comes with a very small cheese enchilada, a delicious tamale, and you can choose a taco.  The jalopy taco is loaded down with ground beef, fried potatoes, lettuce, cheese, olives, etc. and I really enjoyed that as well.  Overall I think it's a little overpriced at $15.95.  It came with a side of clumpy rice and flavorless charro beans.  I ended up doctoring up the leftovers for breakfast the next day.  The tamale was really the best part of that dish.    Mr. M had the sirnoran dog with onion strings and it was a really good hot dog but the bun was way too big.  That entree was $9.95.  Now that I pay attention to some of the other pictures, we'll definitely have to come back and try those batter-dipped fries.  The onion strings were really greasy and all clumped together.  Not all that appealing.  All in before tax and tip it was $43.13.  I don't regret it, but I do think it was a bit much.    Another thing that dropped a star was the ladies' room was pretty nasty, and it was 5:30 in the afternoon.  I can't imagine how it is at 9:00 at night.  Yikes!  I would go back, but it's not high on my list.",

Basics like asking if sweetener was needed when serving ice tea, completely non existent. All of this while the restaurant is slow is unacceptable to say the least.

So I started looking around and try to give off that body language that we were ready to order. Still, no one came. So, my boyfriend and I left. Once we stood up, someone finally realized we were leaving and offered to get someone immediately but by this time, we had already decided to go.   As for the food, it's mediocre.

I wanted a cheese quesadilla but the order menu would only allow me to choose a meat. So I got chicken. It was very good but missing a bit of salt and salsa. It was served with a little bed of salad with an attempt at pico. Would have been much better with a small amount of salsa. The carne asada tacos we're also very tasty. Same challenge, no salsa. I looked up the menu online and it clearly indicates that you get an order of chips and salsa with your meal and extra costs a buck. Where was the salsa? It did not arrive with my meal. Either the delivery driver forgot it. Or, the Taco Garage did not prep it correctly to include the salsa. Either way, no salsa. Guys, I live in Arizona, salsa for Mexican food is like ketchup for French fries. The salsa was missing.",

Margarita was terrible, but my Corona was solid . Take your $12-13/per person and go to Barrio or Joyride if you're interested in great tacos.",

So the fact i took the time to download the app and sign up should tell you something.   Today after a long week we walk in and sit down. We waited about 10 mins and no one ever came to our table. I had to get up and go get my menus for the girl. I sat back down and waited another 15 mins. Finally out of frustration I went up and stood at the bar. I may might as well been invisible because 2 different bar tenders walked right by me without so much as acknowledging my existence. Keep in mind it was unusually SLOW AND NOT CROWDED. There were plenty of staff just standing around.  We ended up walking across the street to bdubs where we were promptly served.   You really screwed up sir vezas, as my 2-3 trips per week will now be ZERO!",

We went on a Wednesday afternoon so it wasn't busy at all and we got amazing service from this waitress from Indiana. She knew all about the menu and was really personable   I ordered the bio bowl which is the vegan option offered on the menu. It is full of veggies, beans, and rice and it really full of flavor. I got it with some red sauce to add a little more depth and flavor. It was really good.   We also ordered a margarita pitcher which was well made and had chunks of fruit in it. A pitcher will run you about $27 and you'll get 4 drinks out of it total, not bad! They also have Pacifico on tap, which is awesome!  For desert I had the pumpkin tamale which was really good and supposedly vegan. They can also made their brownie desert vegan without an egg, but it takes 15-20 minutes to make. It's nice to see a restaurant catering to their customers. I'll definitely be back!",

I've also been to the one at the Phoenix airport to grab a drink from time to time. So when this location opened I was hesitant to try it out and I'm so glad I did anyway!  I've tried so many items on their menu!  The sonoran dog is really good. It's a bacon wrapped hot dog, with beans, salsa, tomato, and it comes with fries. I've also had their Johnny Vegas which is really good. The cilantro cream cheese that comes with it is delicious. Now if you ever order their burrito bowls, make sure you are REALLY hungry because this thing is huge! I got the Go Shaker Chimi and couldn't even eat half of it.   Their margaritas are also really good! and are usually on happy hour. I recommend the strawberry one on the rocks, Get the 14 bomb!   The customer service has always been good. I love their outdoor patio. It is also dog friendly. (I've taken my little monster with me) And it even has a photobooth! What more can you ask for!",

Our friends ordered an appetizer never came out. Told waiter they didn't want appetizer anymore since we received our meals. Lack of communication between all employees even the GM Matt that was their.then My husband order one of burgers, as he was eating pulled paper out of his mouth  (the paper that they use to grill the meat). This was no little piece either about 2inch. He spit out his food and showed one of the employees which showed the cook. They took the burger off our ticket. There was to many people involved on our ticket, Again lack of communication. As we were leaving we talk to the GM Matt since he never came to our table after everything that went wrong. Our friend told GM really need to work on the communication between everyone. He said to her well it's none of your business but I'll be talking to them. Damn right it's my business if I'm being a customer here and it effects me. We asked who is above you he said I'm owner  (well that explains  alot)  we told him we would Google it then he gave us the other 2 owners name. Well I was not going to write a review until my husband was up all night in the restroom needed up going to the emergency room this morning and told him. He has food poison! Will never eat there again. There was so much more but these were the key factors.",

It's probably a better place for drinking then food. Had some seriously bad chicken, rubbery. Service replaced it quickly. My peeve is they bring these baby sized cups of chips out and your constantly having to ask for more chips which takes forever. It's not a total loss as a place to go. Drinks and appetizers are a great deal. Food wise there are other excellent Mexican restaurants in the valley better than this place. Still if your with friends and looking for a chill spot it's great for that.   Brett Russo",

Waitress sara greeted us, it took another 10 minutes to take our order and she was no where to be found. Don't know the guys name but he deserves 5 stars and he took our order, made our apetizer made sure our food came out right and had to catch a ride. We tipped him. Manager asked if food was ok and before I or my husband or friend could ask anything, basically ran away. She asked if we needed anything else, we said boxes and the check please. She brought boxes and asked if we wanted dessert. I'm a server myself, I know the deal, if I ask for a check it usually means I don't want dessert. We asked for the check a SECOND  time and she comes back saying \"I don't know what you ordered since I didn't take your order so how do you want me to split it\".  Seriously, in my 11 years of serving I have never, NEVER, said that to a table..... Also to include the last time we were there the manager told the server that if she wanted an amount taken off the bill SHE WOULD HAVE TO PUT HER OWN HARD WON TIPS TOWARDS IT EVEN THOUGH IT WASN'T HER FAULT THAT OUR FOOD CAME OUT AT DIFFERENT TIMES ALONG WITH OUR APETIZER COMING OUT THE SAME TIME AS OUR BILL!  This place pissed me off again and I will never go back unless they hire ppl who are willing to work and actually make sure their tables are ok.",

Needless to say we tipped him well.  The ambiance of the restaurant is great because it is kind of inside, but no walls so you can see outside.  The have a DJ every day.  I feel bad because they are in the infamous cursed location of Chandler Mall.  No place ever lasts there. I can't say I for sure would eat here again without the Living Social deal I got for this restaurant. It is a little pricey.  The Nachos are definitely worth the money, but from what I can see on the Yelp pictures it looks like everything else may be a little overpriced.",

I had the most interesting vegetables in the world as an appetizer which was a mix of green and red peppers, onions, jalapeno, broccoli, and pickles all fried in a tempura batter and served with a side of chipotle ranch! I also ate their carne asada tacos which where also very good. over all I would eat there again!",

    "text": "The first time I went to this restaurant I was extremely satisfied. Their food is amazing, the atmosphere is fun, and the servers are all unique and entertaining. However, as I kept going back, it seemed as though the service got worse and worse every time. Being a vegan there's only a few things I can eat at this restaurant but their Bio Fuel burrito is so good I wanted to branch out. I went by myself on a weekend during lunch to order the mushroom tacos, only to be served bean tacos with 3 pieces of small mushroom in each one. The mushrooms were nowhere in site, and when I asked why they were called mushroom tacos or if I could get more, she simply answered \"if you wanted something else maybe order something else next time.\" The next time I went back, the vegan burrito (it's on the menu as vegan) was served to me with meat in it and they were huffy and puffy when I asked them to remake it, and the last time (probably the last time for good) the rice in my burrito was so over cooked and mushy it was inedible. My boyfriend also got a dish with rice on the side and they served him white mush as well. I'm giving 3 stars because when the food is cooked right and you get a good server the place is worth 5, but when it's wrong it's so wrong it ruins your entire meal. Unfortunately, I don't recommend for anything other than cocktails during happy hour!",

However, this place seems like the new touch of tuscon desert needs and fills a valid role in Chandler fashion square. To be honest I was not willing to go at first and got dragged here by my significant other. To explain the service I doubt I could do it justice. They were willing to let us sample all their flavors from cheese to several of the beers before deciding. They were very attentive and caring for a chain restaurant. I understand this is the fifth in the chain. The food was great. Actually the portions were larger than expected and the flavor was not skipped. I have tried at least three of the tacos. Not to mention diet friendly for my vegan and gluten free friends. Just wow. I don't normally dish out a four star rating a first time but this place really has it. Even the rice is good. Something most places overlook. It's blooming with cilantro and flavor.",

My gf sat at a table for over an hour and did not have anyone approach her table. An hour seriously? She ended up going to the bar to get a drink. She even went to the hostess twice asking for someone to help her. I showed up and had to wait 15 min and no one came over to help me either. Lots of people walking around which u didn't know if they worked there or not. Finally, my husband came in after finding a parking spot and ended up going to the bar to get us drinks. Then after flagging someone down to ask if he could help us he said he needed to see who was waiting on our section. He came back and said he could help us. Btw I ended up speaking to the operations manager and imposed the question..\"does it normally take an hour to be waited on\" in which he had a nice smart ass response im not gonna repeat. We finally ended up with a cool waiter which turned out to be way awesome but trying to get over the shitty service for the first hour and a half was a bit difficult. Well needless to say, we used to. Key word.. Used to love this place. Now I'm not so sure. I will be spending my money elsewhere because no one should have to wait an hour to be waited on! I'm not sure wtf they are doing there but with service like that they won't be having repeat customers.",

We ordered a mix of drinks from wine to beer to margaritas.  All were good.  For dinner, I ordered a burrito covered in red sauce.  It was excellent and really too much for one person.  My wife had a pulled pork taco and a veggie taco.  Both tacos were good.  We choose this restaurant because it was close to our hotel but glad we found it.

The food was alright however the ambiance and customer service was TERRIBLE!! First off, when I walked in I tripped over their bent front rug (very irresponsible) then the hostess says \"table for 2\" (blank face) no hello nothing! She then starts walking away from us so we followed her confused. We were sat on a wet booth then it seriously took 15mins just get chips/salsa & waters. Once we got that the waiter disappeared for another 10mins we had to wave him TWICE to get his attention. We finally get to order enchilada stacks with rice & beans. Another 15mins passed and we get our enchiladas. The waiter says the rice/beans will be out shortly \"odd\" but we still remain friendly and patient. Beans come aprox. 5mins after (no rice)We end up finishing our meal and still NO RICE. At this point we are done with this place and ask for the check. And surprise!! We are being charged for the rice we never got! We asked for a discount but were cut half way through our request due to our waiter snatching the receipt off our hands and running off. As we walked out we passed our waiter and other employees and no goodbye or thank you (not to mention we never got an apology for the rice incident).  We had the worse time here, we go to this mall VERY often but will NEVER step foot In this establishment ever again!!!!",

Our waitress disappeared so often we had to ask two other people to look for her. And then had to wait 15 more minutes before she showed. She brought us the wrong drink and after offering to discount it, the manager came and told is he couldn't, we let it go just so we could get out of there. The appetizer was terrible and we would've tried something else except, you guessed it, our waitress had vanished into the ether. It's not worth sweating your ass off in steel seating. Trust me.",

All the servers were dressed and of different body types! The food was delicious.  Hubby got the shredded beef bowl,  and I tried a bowl as well! Yum,  and plenty left over. They have a great kids menu too! We used the check-in offer for a pumpkin tamales, but they were out so they substituted it with fried ice cream which comes with churros! Amazing!!!!",

Our server came and took our order, she was nice, brought us water, I did assume that they stopped serving chips and salsa as we did not get any with our water like we used to get when we used to go before, but then I saw every table around us that got them, even the people at the bar. My husband ordered the Street Corn, without Tajin on it, he doesn't like tajin, (the server that asked us if we wanted menus is the one that ended up bringing my husbands corn out to him, and it had tajin, he told her that he did order it without it, she grabbed it, and said oh ok, we can get you a new one, which was nice, but then walked away and rolled her eyes, she was kind of a snob) we could of done without the eye rolling, not my fault she doesn't like her job, it would of been a little better. Also when we order beer a tall one, you might as well order a regular one, all the beers for some reason we're at least 2-2 1/2 inches away from being full from the top of the glass, why is that. My Nachos, that's another story, I don't know where I've ever gone some where and had cold Nachos where the cheese was not melted? Here's a tip, you guys should put the meat beans and cheese on them and broil them and then out the other toppings on, that's just an idea, and less water in the pico and warm the meat up too please. My Sir Chelada was good like always. But this time was a disappointment overall.",

While there we ate at place called El Charro and the owner told us he was opening a new restaurant near us.  The restaurant was auto garage themed but I think the restaurant  is suffering from an identity crisis because the building mentioned nothing about being a taco garage, only yelp totally us that.  Service was good, but they served Pepsi products (not a Pepsi fan). Second the food was so so. The chips and salsa were great, but our appetizer was a big bucket of oily fried foods. Enough so, that had we finished all of it, we probably wouldn't have felt great. The portions on items that went by our table were huge, maybe too big. All and all, I've say it was average, not horrible, not great, just average.",

On a 1-10 scale my 1st visit for the Senoran Dog was an 8, the 2nd visit a 9, but the 3rd visit was only a 4. I'm not sure if I will be back after this as the hot dog tasted steamed not grilled, the charo beans were cold, and overall the ingredients just didn't taste fresh. I visited the location at 11am so it wasn't like everything was sitting out all day so I'm not sure what happened. I hoped for a good east valley location to satisfy the Senoran Hot Dog craving of the famous El Guero Canelo. Also some fresh salsa would be nice, not to sure why they provide pre-packaged salsa unless trying to go for the fast food thing. Have your servers fill some to-go cups with fresh made salsa, would probably be a lot cheaper too.",

We also found a bug floating in the tower, that never ended up coming out so I'm guessing he'll continue to float around. Hopefully they washed it thoroughly after us.

Our server was Nicole and we definitely were not disappointed with her either.  The same word, AMAZING, could be used to describe her as a server.  We had been warned that the taco salad was huge.  That description was no wrong.  Not only was it huge but it was also AMAZINGLY delicious.  We both agreed it was the best taco salad we had ever had.

Sir Veza's serves up their take on the Sonoran called, \"El Sirnoran.\"  El Sirnoran Dog is eight-inches of 100% Angus beef hot dog wrapped in applewood bacon with beans, jalapeno salsa, and tomatoes topped with a drizzle of mayo and mustard.  Knife and forking this bad boy isn't too embarrassing because holding this wiener to your lips is borderline NSFW but dang is it delicious.  I also tried their flavorful Enchilada Stack with shredded beef and topped with an egg.  I never had enchiladas topped with a fried egg before but I'm not sure I want to eat them without an egg ever again.  The yolk porn... my goodness! For drinks, I got the Mexican Mule which was okay. I liked my friend's Mint Condition Mojito a lot more!  They have an amazing Monday-Saturday Happy Hour menu from 3-7PM and 9PM-close.  I think I'll be back only for their Happy Hour specials.  As for their Sirnoran Dog, as good as it is, I rather get my dogs from a doguero at some local Mexican joints around town.  3.5 stars!",

Great prices throughout the menu. The Happy Hour deals you can't beat. $4.95 for many popular appetizers. Delish eats, however the wing sauce was a little sweeter than we had expected. Would have liked more heat! Still delicious!   Prickly Pear iced tea is unusually tasty & a must try!  A fun place! Great concept which gears itself as a garage style atmosphere. The napkins are actual red mechanics rags!   The wait staff friendly. Attentive and professional.  Nice menu choices and fair prices.",

The hostess was not welcoming, not even a greet, she just stood there with no smile lol and I asked for a table for two and started walking away to the table should would seat us.   Now the waiter, took almost 15 MINUTES to take our drink and food order, I had to waive him down from across the restaurant to get his attention and when he walks up at least he admitted that he \"totally forgot about us.\" We were very close to walking out which we should have done.... the elder couple behind us always walked away because they were had no order taken, and only waters. That's is absolutely sad to see this elder couple walk out.   Our food came out, well only partial of it. He came out with our enchiladas and mentioned that our rice and beans will be out shortly which was only correct for our beans as OUR RICE NEVER CAME!   The next time we saw him we asked for the check. And at this point you should assume that there would be a discount for the rice right?! Exactly that's what I expected too but nope he brought our the check and no discount so as I was ready to pay I asked him to please add a discount for rice that was never served. As we walked out he got a dirty look like we were the problem. Very ducked up, makes me feel like I should not had left a dollar for ... \"effort\"??? Yeah never coming back again and hope no one does.   The food was aight though....   UPDATE! So happy this place is no longer there!",

    "text": "I've been wanting to visit Sir Veza's Taco Garage for awhile -- any place with Mexican food and a patio is one that piques my interest. I was bummed about my experience there, though, and would recommend heading to BJ's nearby for much better service and atmosphere next time you're in the Chandler mall area and need a place to go to eat.  We were sat in a booth facing a sports television and lots of larger tables. The menus we received were dirty -- they had liquid and crumbs on them. Gross.  It took about 10 minutes after being sat for our hostess to bring us waters and chips. That was nice, but I really wanted to order a margarita, especially because we had a movie to get to and were on a bit of a time crunch. Several employees including a server walked by our table and looked directly at us, but there was no acknowledgement. Even a, \"Hey, we just got slammed, but I'll be with you shortly\" would have been great.  The chips were average, nothing to celebrate, but it's nice they're complimentary. The table set-up was a little odd -- each person gets a single fork and a rag that is supposed to be a napkin, but that looks like something the bussers use, too. I needed a fork for both my appetizer and my meal, so it's weird you don't just get one.  After about 15 minutes after being sat, a server came by to get our drink order. I had already gulped down all my water. From there, the meal was smooth sailing, but the dining experience was poorly managed to make two people wait 15 minutes to get a drink order going.  The strawberry margarita I did get was almost too surgary to drink. There wasn't a balance of flavors, and I quickly switched to beer.  The cheese quesadilla was huge and mighty tasty, thickly piled with cheese. Splitting half of it was enough to have a meal, along with the free chips.   I did order two vegetarian tacos and a side of refried beans and rice. I've never had Brussels sprouts on tacos and now want to try to re-create the recipe at home. That was an innovative taco topping, and one I give the restaurant kudos for. Several corn tortillas were used for each taco. They were sort of difficult to eat because of the awkward construction, but the taste was there.  While the food was decent, the ambiance was another negative aspect to this spot. I felt like the space wasn't used wisely -- between our booth and the tables, there was a large amount of space that just looked awkwardly set up. Maybe more tables or booths could have filled the random spots of big spaces in the restaurant.   The bathroom had a communal washbin area. Thankfully, the women's bathroom also had its own sinks, because I think it's really weird to be on display washing your hands all as a group outside the main bathrooms. But on the other hand, if you wash your hands in the women's bathroom and then skip the second communal station, it might seem like you never washed your hands. This is another example of the weird layout of the restaurant.  If you are in Chandler and want great Mexican food, go to Valle Luna, my favorite place. The service and ambiance are much better, and the food is much more memorable, too.",

And it's also a good place to watch all the televised games on college Fball Saturday or NFL Sundays!  What grabbed my attention always walking past the food court was their Sirnoran Hot Dog had a 100% angus all beef hot dog.  I shoved it down my pie hole and enjoyed every bite!  Oh of course there's the onion rings....beer battered but batter fell apart on a few so perhaps I would pass next time but they were A-OK.    Yes I know there are other places around town that serve the Sonoran Dog BUT well let's just say they all looked down at the floor when I ask about what kind of weiners they use!  Yea uh huh sure that's right go ahead and shove that craptastic junkified Oscar Mayer ding dong up your hoo hah where the sun don't shine!    There was a time when \"Back in the Days when I was young I'm not a kid anymore but some days I wish I was a kid again\" I could care less about what's in my hot diggity dog and would only focus on taste and flava only.  Welp the name Sirnoran Dog is well deserved cause I crushed it like a Sir, like a gentleman, like a boss yessirey indeedy!  I'll be back for HH specials!",

Finally had to turn around and ask if there was a bartender or someone working so I could place in order. Then the bartender finally came over took my order and then forgot to put it in . the food is good. And the portions are ample but the service was horrible. I used up my gift card cause I probably wont go back very often there wasn't a soul in the restaurant . While some of the other reviews have talked about them being so busy. There was no excuse for the poor service and if the food aint great who needs poor service",

Our waiter Marcus was fantastic and the food was awesome!  We all tried something different and we all loved what we got. I ordered the chicken enchilada which was prepared a different way, that I loved!  You've got to order the guacamole because they come to the table to make it, so put everything in it, it's awesome!  Chips & Salsa are good too! We've been back 4 times in just a few short weeks. Can't say enough about this place. Loved it, loved it, loved it!",

The bartender Colby was super sweet and told me a ton about the background of some of the menu items and cocktails. Although I heard they are known for their gourmet street tacos I took a risk and ordered the Shrimp Stuffed Chile Rellano and man I'm sure happy I did! It had bacon, avocado, tomatoes, queso fresco and so much more goodness inside.  In addition to the classic sides of rice and beans they also included a zucchini and squash blend that was served in some sort of really taste sauce. I probably would of tried to squeeze in dessert if they're complimentary chips and salsa weren't so good! LOL  Also the Pink Paloma margarita is served with this grapefruit soda in a massive glass and I highly recommend trying one! Everything was great, I will certainly be back next Thursday to try the tacos...and more tequila.",

My gal & I can recommend the SirNoran dog, the Diablo shrimp tacos, the fajitas (not your average)   Save room for dessert as the apple chimichanga is amazing & unique. The drink menu is just as creative & tasty as the food. The outdoor patio is great place to enjoy all this great fare. Ole",

You can tell they make the batch early and then let it sit. Out food came in like 4 minutes.... So if fresh quality food matters to you. I would skip it. Now I have 3 stars because the waitress did handle it well. She got the manager and it was taken off our bill. They offered to replace but I just wanted popcorn at that moment. So I was happy with how they dealt with it. Maybe I got unlucky? I usually NEVER say anything because I get embarrassed. but this was gross. I am sad. I thought we found a new spot. We tipped the waitress based on the original bill since she did a good job fixing thing. Not her fault they cut corners on the kitchen.",

It was a Friday afternoon around 4pm-5pm so it wasn't too packed yet. It was happy hour so they had 1/2 off appetizers and some discounted drinks which was good. We ordered a round of micheladas and let me tell you, my brother wasn't lying. They were good! When it came to the food, I ordered a appetizer. It was the Jalapeno Poppers (they had a different name and cant remember what it is). They were ok. Very crunchy which im not use to with jalapeno poppers and the cream cheese inside was very runny. I wouldn't get them again. For my meal I ordered the shrimp tacos (grilled shrimp not the Diablo shrimp) and it came with rice and beans. The rice and beans were not good. I'm Mexican so I guess you can say I have a high standard of what they should taste like and this wasn't it. Very generic almost tasted like they were canned. The rice was also not well cooked, kinda dry and crunchy. The shrimp tacos were good. The seasoning was good and the salsa it had was also very good. I would get them again but minus the rice and beans. All in all a great place for drinks but if you want Mexican food, definitely not the place for it.",

    "text": "I've never written a yelp review but I feel this place needs to hear it as a former bartender and waitress I get sometimes you get busy but this was pure laziness.  I wanted to come for a celebration with family and friends and everything was HORRIBLE and made the night not what you want for celebrating. 1st the hostess with a huge attitude and extremely RUDE didn't have my reservation for 15 people but luckily there was plenty of space on the patio. After we finally got seated it took me after about 15-20 minutes of patiently waiting to get up and ask a sever if we could get service.        2 of the 3 people that chose to order food never got it because the order was never put in.  I had to constantly find our server to keep drinks full, remind them what they forgot or ask for it to be made how we ordered it,  at one point I ran my own drinks from the bar that sat there for a good 10 minutes while the \"manager\" was behind the bar just washing dishes. While I also watched my 2 servers standing by the POS stations ..       Lastly my bf and I sat down at the bar after everyone else left to have a drink together n couldn't get acknowledged yet alone service so we went over to BJS n got great friendly service..  Compltely ruined my experience and celebration. I've been here before and had bad service like this but just chalked it up to its a new place they need time, well this was the last time I or anyone of the 15 people who came to Sir Vezas last night will be back or spend our money there. I hope they find good help that cares and knows what they are doing..",

We walk in and it wasn't very busy so we were seated right away. Now the waiter was the main problem. He was maybe 23-25  and he looked like he was a meth addict. He was taking extremely fast, really jumpy, very very paranoid (he was always looking around like someone was following him) and he was always a scratching his wrist. He was nice but he made me extremely uncomfortable. The food was ok it wasn't anything special. Don't think we'll come back anytime soon.",

    "text": "This place is new in the dreaded location at the south main entrance to Chandler Fashion Square.  I say \"dreaded\" because every restaurant here has gone out of business for some reason even though the location is ideal for a restaurant.  I think Sir Veza's might be number 4 or 5 since 2001?  I'm not sure why the others failed.  But I digress!!!  The remodel looks great.  Very open with good TV viewing everywhere, and a nice indoor/outdoor seating arrangement.  The staff was Fantastic!  They truly acted like they wanted to be there.  Our server \"Fire\" was on fire with his service and attitude.  Really nice guy that cared about the place and the customers.  I ordered the 2 taco combo.  They were fantastic and nicely done.  They have an interesting approach to \"glueing\" two corn tortillas together with cheese to make a bigger taco.   Loved the chips and sides too (charro beans and rice).  Also you could get a \"protein style\" taco wrapped in lettuce for you low carb types.  I wish they put cheese in those though. (they didn't with my S.O.'s lettuce-wrap taco)  Fire mentioned that they also cater to gluten free people so that's great and unusual for a Mexican joint.  The margaritas were great too, btw!  The only down sides:    1.  I'd like to see a way to order tacos a la carte though so I could get more taco and no sides.   2.  The prices are high for the amount of food you get.  $12 for two tacos and beans and rice, and $15 for three tacos and beans and rice.  Ouch!   This could seriously stop many folks from coming back even though they love the food, IMO.  Suggestions: 1.  Add taco take-out at the food-court window.  You can only get hotdogs or something like that now.",

    "text": "I have been to Sir Veza's two times now and I am only mildly impressed. The service has been pretty good but the food is just okay. My fiance has really enjoyed the burger's here but I have not liked either of the items I have tried. On our first visit I tried the Johnny Las Vegas roll which is kind of like a sushi style roll but it's not seafood. Instead it is a mixture of chicken, cream cheese, jalapeno, chipolte sauce and maybe a couple of other items thrown in all wrapped up in a chimichanga type of wrap. I did not care for this at all. It kind of tasted like chicken salad to me which I cannot stand. If you like chicken salad, you might like this, if you hate mushy texture, you will hate it.  I did also try the La Bomba soft pretzel with strips of poblano peppers and swiss cheese and served with nacho cheese dipping sauce and mustard, I did like this a lot. On our second visit which was on New Years day I tried the Sonoran Dog. I did not care for this either. For me the hot dog itself was way too salty. The beer battered fries are however delicious. On New Years day they also had a DJ at 7:30pm who was just bumping beats the entire time we were there. It seemed like he was trying to turn the place into a night club. The music selection was terrible, with rap songs melding into country. It was extremely off putting. My fiance and I could not carry a conversation because of the mini night club situation. The DJ was the only one dancing and was clearly enjoying himself very much.  If it were up to me I probably would not come back. My fiance does love the burger here so we will probably give it another shot. If we do come back I will try the tacos on the next visit. We will also probably come early in the day on a weekday. I'm not up for the rap/country/pop mash up night club.",

    "text": "This restaurant is the best \"garage\" ever!   Most of the staff is incredibly friendly and welcome you as you walk past.   Decor is all moto... Shop rags for napkins, wheels for the base to booths, drop-light lighting, wrench chandelier, truck and motorcycle parts on the walls & ceilings, side mirror collage over sink basin, and the list goes on.  So very creative.     Big screen TVs everywhere for the sports fans.    The food is a mixed lot.   First visit we ordered nachos... Thankfully only one order as they serve a HUGE amount.  (Seriously 1/4 sheet cake piled high). We chose the pork with prickly pear salsa and the meat was melt in your mouth perfection.     Second visit I had the best hamburger that I've eaten in years.   No bun, but they do offer Gluten Free buns. Woohoo! Drag strip chicken was pretty good, dredged in corn flour, no wheat!!  Hubby had chimi, again like the nachos, the portion is HUGE.  ( good for a big dude )  The fries were undercooked and a little cold, but have potential.     They were out of their \"special\" (cannot remember what it was that day).  Good thing they have plenty to choose from.   And GLUTEN FREE options.  Which is good for those of is with intolerance or mild allergies.   I hope they are successful and stay!!!",

But it was Tuesday 1/2 price tacos, so why not. Our food arrived very quick and was actually very good, the chicken and beef tacos very moist. Large portions, the server actually warmed up to us after our meal casually visiting with us??? I would try again.",

My server, Bobby, went up and above the call of duty to get the kitchen to make them for me. I will definitely be back because of him! He's also super hot, so that's a plus!!",

    "text": "I absolutely love the Diablo shrimp tacos from here, I mean seriously I crave them. Anyway my wife and I came by yesterday for a lunch date and both ordered 3 tacos, she ordered Nana's chicken, carnitas and carne asada tacos. The Nanas chicken taco was amazing, the other 2 were good as well, but the chicken was far and away her favorite. I ordered the Diablo shrimp, the vegetarian taco, and the chicken club taco. The Diablo shrimp was super delicious as always, sweet and spicy, with shrimp that are crispy on the outside and perfectly cooked on the inside. The vegetarian taco was actually a bit of a surprise in how good it actually was. Super fresh tasting, with an awesome garlicky cream sauce and crispy fried avocado it's going to become a regularly ordered item for me. The chicken club however was just blah to be honest, nothing bad about it, it just didn't impress the way the other two tacos did. We really enjoyed our food, but as others have said, the service was definitely lacking. It took our server 15 mins AFTER we had gotten our margaritas to offer us water as well, and she didn't check in after we had gotten our food, she was no where to be found when we were ready for the check, and it really wasn't busy...we were one of 5 families at the restaurant. But otherwise the food was great as usual!",
