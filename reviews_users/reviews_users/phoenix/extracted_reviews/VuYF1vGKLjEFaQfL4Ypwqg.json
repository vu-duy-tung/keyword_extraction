What I don't like is that when I order my mixed drink the bartender pours light, as in, he doesn't fill the jigger.  If you don't have the skill to free-pour (use no jigger) then at least fill the jigger....otherwise, you're cheating the customers.",

There were tables that weren't being cleaned up in a timely manner. It was a bit unorganized as far as the ordering process, counter vs at the table. Will not be coming back, would not recommend it to a friend. The old Gallo Blanco was better!",

    "text": "After being crushed when the old location closed, my wife and I were excited to try this place.   The new location is odd. While close to downtown (and technically probably considered downtown), it's in the middle of a quiet residential neighborhood. Which I guess is fine, just strange. The space itself is nice,(if not a little hipsterish) and street parking was easy. I'm not sure if they have a lot themselves.  They have switched to an order at the counter, get a number system, as opposed to full service. Which generally I don't mind, but it doesn't seem to work well the way they have it setup. Just one register was open, and we had 2 people in front of us. The register person has to take their order and get any non-alcoholic drinks they ask for. This takes a while. I would say we were waiting for over 5-10 minutes just behind a couple of people. It must be much worse when they are busy.   The menu is similar to the old one, but as several other reviews have mentioned it is almost all in Spanish. Which is usually fine, but there were menu items that had a sentence or two description all in Spanish. This holds up the line even further due to people having to ask so many questions.  Eventually we were able to order. This is not a cheap place. We got 6 tacos, chips and guac, and 2 beers, and with a 15% tip (reminder, no full service) it was over $50. The old location had a killer happy hour, but I saw nothing posted about one here. Maybe they will work it in eventually.   At this point, you maybe thinking, how did this get 4 stars? Well....the food is just absolutely delicious. The tacos are very simple, but the quality of the ingredients is superb. I ate 3 tacos, and probably could of eaten 3 more.   Anyways, to sum up, the food is great, but the prices and ordering system leave something to be desired. And would love to see a happy hour make a return.",

Ceviche was so delicious, fresh with the right amount of spice, first to disappear from the table. Corn on the cob comes with a boy to prepare it at the table, also super yummy - highly recommend.

She needs further training as she was inattentive and then slow once we did get her attention.   The place was VERY warm and super loud.  I do appreciate that it is in an old market and the furnishings/architecture are cool.  Free cookies at the counter was a plus!  We had the chorizo bean dip and chips.  Delicioso!  The chips were fresh and crisp.  We also had the guac. I was intrigued by the addition of oranges but you could not even taste them and the guac was average.  Not bad but nothing to write home about.  The Pozole Rojo got high marks but the diner would have liked more onions.  The salad La De Casa with chicken had a weird \"fishy\" taste.  The diner also asked for the dressing on the side and it was drenched upon arrival.  She used the term \"rancid\".  The plus on this was the chicken, grilled, flavorful, plentiful.  Chicken Chilaquiles - more like a stacked enchilada.  The scrambled eggs I requested were a fried egg with the yolk broken.  The green sauce was too thin and vinegary.  I poured off all I could. Side note, it did taste better after sitting overnight.  Both the soup and chilaquiles were served promptly and piping hot. Last displeasure, $3.50 for a glass of tea is outrageous.  More than a Starbucks Trenta!  Overall 2 of the 3 of us would not go back and would not recommend.  Sorry!",

It turns out they only have one cocktail on special for happy hour which is a 5$ margarita....not a bad deal. We each got one..... it's standard fare..... Super heavy on the alcohol (I felt it after just the one). The flavor was very boozy and not very limey making it a real sipper (read: hard to drink).   After our one drink, we decided to move on. We paid at the bar using cards. They use square but print receipts from it rather than use the tablet version. Luckily, Square emails the receipt. It turned out that the bartender had accidentally put in my total as the tip (ie put in 7$ for the tip on a 5.50 tab charging me about 12$ total). I probably would never have noticed it if it weren't for square emailing a receipt. The manager was quick to take care of it the next day and refund the money, which I appreciated.   Anyway, take home message is I'd love to go back and try the food (and update this at that time), but their happy hour is lacking in the drinks department. Maybe they will consider doing a blanket discount on specialty cocktails (a dollar or two) which would be much more appealing than one super cheap drink that isn't all that great. Oh, and check your square emails people.",

My husband and I tried out Gallo Blanco for the first time last week after researching where we could find some of the best tacos in Phoenix. We went with high hopes, and we were not disappointed! I have to say those were the best tacos I've ever had!  The carne asada and barbacoa tacos were my personal favorites. To top it off, it was happy hour so tacos and drinks were incredibly reasonably priced!  Our server, Mara, was very friendly, fast and efficient! We  will definitely be back next time we are in Phoenix",

The lady was quite rude and advised us to a high top table, my husband proceeded to tell her that would not work since we had young kids with us. She replied rudely \"well it is self seating\". We proceeded to make it work by pulling some tables together. From here on out we have a pleasant experience. Our waitress was super sweet and even gave us a pancake to try \"on the house\".",

We almost didn't come back just because of him but I decided I wanted some take out from there this Friday (6/28). Guess who took my order? Yep, Mike G again. I almost walked out but didn't because I was hungry. I ordered an Al Pastor burrito (& a Carne Asada for my husband, papas fritas, guac). When I got home & started eating the burrito, I noticed it was extremely chewy. I started looking inside and I pulled out a giant ring of what looked like either fat or intestines. I almost puked. Almost the entire burrito had these disgusting fat/tripe looking things in it & barely any nice chunks of Al Pastor. Needless to say, I didn't finish. The next day, I had to leave work because I started vomitting, this went into the next day. I lost 12 hours of work because of this burrito. Thanks Gallo & Mike G, I will literally never be back & never recommend to anyone again.",

Is a little pricey, but it is downtown and the food is actually good.",

This food has the real flavor of Mexican Food, mainly the Tacos al Pastor are delicious, also the Carne Asada Tacos. The taste of everything is extremely good.

As the waitress came up I decided to order the guacamole, which is my favorite! I donlt think I eat guacamole at any other places, but here. It is so good and they still make it the same with oranges, my fiance and dad were impressed with the great taste. As we ordered our food I got the Pastor torta, my fiance, the Asada torta and my dad the huarache Patron. Everything we order was so good! The torta was a good size and the meat inside was delicious.  I can't wait to go back and try a new dish!. The service is very good and our waitress was very attentive.",

The Tierra Madre cocktail may be one of the best cocktails I have ever had...mezcal, freshly juiced tumeric, and tamarindo dressed with lime and fresh thyme.  I started with a carne asada taco...on house-made blue corn tortilla...delicious! I also had the elote callejero (Street corn) shaved off the cob...also the best I've ever tasted (ask for lime to go with it).   I was still hungry so I asked Andy which taco he would recommend next and got the Del Mar....lightly battered fried fish with tasty slaw and sauce...also terrific.   The tacos are traditional small ones so two were perfect for me with the elote. I only ate two chips so I probably could have skipped that altogether.  Try this place! I'm in town from Atlanta for the weekend for a workshop. This was a great recommendation by people I met at the Abraham workshop this morning. Their holiday party here will be awesome!",

Decided on the Carne Asada burrito and Carne Asada Taco. This burrito had such potential with good flavored meat. The downside was the beans which actually ended up drowning out the Carne Asada. Very little meat compared to the amount of beans. Don't get me wrong the beans tasted good. It's just I didn't order a bean burrito looking to taste Carne Asada every once in a while. Next time I would consider the Pork shoulder Pozole. No complementary chips & salsa here folks! Also was not blown away by the sauces available. Step up your game Gallo Blanco if you want five stars!",

    "text": "FINALLY, Gallo Blanco has made its return to Phoenix and to my BELLY!!! I went to Gallo Blanco in the past when it was in the hotel location and I was super stoked when it reopened as its own restaurant. Its in a neighborhood that looks like its slowly being revived by Phoenix. I personally think its awesome. Kinda like your going to mom's house, since its tucked away within a historic homes area. There isn't a ton of parking but on Sunday afternoon we didn't have a problem finding some near the building. The Building itself looks like a old barn, maybe its new... I don't know but it is beautiful and fits the area really well. Walking in it is pretty loud in there, but it didn't bother us too much.   So this time you order your food first, then sit down and they bring it out to you. We ordered a Elote to share, La Charola (chips and salsa and Guac), and I got 3 Carne Asada and1 al Pastor, and 1 campechana.   We found our seats and within maybe 5 minutes the Elote came out it has butter, chile powder, cojita cheese, and mayo. The waitress offered to cut it off the cob and of course we accepted. It was Bomb... It was spot on. I wish I would have gotten my own, but we got a ton of food so I dealt with sharing. Right when we were about to finish, out came la charola... Plenty of chips, 3 kinds of salsa and our favorite the guacamole. The guac had fruit mixed in, we couldn't tell what it was but it was giving it a sweet kick to it.   Finally TACOS!!! The tortillas are still homemade and delicious and soft. All tacos were served simple with diced onion, and cilantro... I mean really a good taco doesn't need crap thrown on it.. The carne asada are always my favorite, but I have to admit... I was shocked when Al Pastor flared up my taste buds with excitement!!! Lastly was the campechana (mix asada, al pastor, and chorizo). I gotta say next time im gonna have a hard time deciding what to get because the campechana was so freaking good!!! There is no way I could rank these. They are each delicious in their own way. Next time ill just have to 2 of each!!   The service and the waitresses were also great and quick, and the restaurant was clean... Don't think about going here... Make it a point to visit!!",

We had the burrito special which was good but we would have preferred the pork be in chunks rather than a whole slice. The veggie taco was decent and the asada had a good grill flavor but a little dry. The ambience was awesome with the big windows and music. The drinks were perfect and will definitely be back to try other items!",

Then the chips with guac and salsa sampler came out, amazing! Each salsa was unique with spicy to smokey flavor profiles. The elote and taco Dorado came out together, he even cut the corn for us. The elote is incredible, cheesy, kind of smoky. That taco Dorado though, omg! The taco shell is fried, nuff said. The meat is tender and the cheese, i need that at home.

Grabbed a table for the 6 of us and ordered the Happy Hour Margaritas for the group and chips and dip. Fun salsas and guac to try as well. There was tamarind, pico and other spicy flavors.  My hubby and I ordered the elote to share. It was nice of them to ask if they could carve the corn for us, it was pretty charred and not overly cheesy. I ordered the posole rojo which was excellent. A huge bowl served with flour tortillas, my favorite. Could have used an extra lime and more protein but loved it. He ordered the family style tacos where you select 2 different types of protein, al pastor and carnitas. The huge stalks of green onion threw me off bu the tacos were very tasty and plenty of tortillas to share. Everyone else seems to enjoy their meals. First time there and would like to try it again very soon.",

The Fresh Guacamole and Chips are to die for and my go to is the Naco Torta.   All the sauces and guacamole are so good and fresh, love the chips with the guacamole.  The marinated beef in the Naco Torta is killer along with bread, fried egg and slices of avocado in the Sandwich.  The new building location is beautiful and so throwback modern, great job.  The surrounding area has potential and is in the middle of older garfield neighborhood, when I was first looking for the restaurant, I thought this has to be wrong, but there it was.  Still one of my favorite places to go and eat. Glad you are back.",

    "text": "It's been almost 2.5 years since the original Gallo Blanco closed at the Clarendon Hotel. Owner Doug Robson promised an eventual return, which took much longer than I had originally expected. But finally, Gallo 2.0 is here, complete with a new location/setup, a slightly modified but mostly similar menu, and a customer base of loyal fans that, based on the crowd on their first Saturday night being open, clearly didn't forget about them. With their borderline frustrating all-Spanish menu and core audience that covers virtually every single hipster cliche to the point where it's almost comical, it's safe to say that not much has changed since 2015.  Originally, you ordered at the counter and the food was then brought out to you. During a recent visit, it appears that this was changed to a more traditional sit-down approach, which I think works must better.   My girlfriend was a huge fan of the original Gallo Blanco tacos, specifically their carne asada. I had only dined there once before they closed and can remember being blown away by their quality. Despite the owner's sister restaurant, Otro Cafe, also offering tacos, she insisted that they were nowhere near the level as what was once served at Gallo. After several visits since first opening, I think I understand what she was talking about.  Everything taco-wise is excellent, including the asada, pastor, and my personal favorite, the campechana. The tacos don't go overboard with additional ingredients and while I have noticed some slight inconsistencies here or there with meat preparation, they're still largely superior to what you'd find at most other places. And suddenly, all my snarky remarks about thick-rimmed glasses, fedoras, and flawlessly dyed man-beards suddenly become irrelevant. When the tacos are this good, who really gives a damn?  Some say this place excels as a torta joint. I finally got around to trying an al pastor, which was fine, although not quite as satisfying as its taco counterpart. However, sometimes I think the most fun at Gallo can be had with their more adventurous items, such as the envuelto, which is a gooey and cheesy al pastor that you fold inside tortillas. Even something like the simple, yet very well done chicharron de queso, which is a pyramid of ultra-crispy cheese, can be strangely satisfying.  Desserts are kind of hit and miss. The banana cream pie is excellent, while the flapjacks are definitely an unexpected surprise, as they come off more like crepes in texture. I'm a big fan. I've only had the churros once, which was a total botch-job. They were undercooked and very doughy to the point where I'm not sure I'd be willing to take a risk on them again.  Overall, despite a few kinks here and there, I anticipate that Gallo's return will be a huge success. With an already established fan-base and tacos that are top of the line in terms of both quality and flavor, I anticipate very good things for this little restaurant in the future.  Highly recommended!",

    "text": "I have been meaning to get over to Gallo Blanco for sometime now but always end up going to their sister restaurant Otro Cafe. So glad we decided to do dinner here last night!  Immediately upon entering Gallo I was really impressed with the space and the vibe. The space itself is just gorgeous, it's much bigger than I imagined it to be. When I initially saw some reviews with pictures posted of the interior and the large food menu posted over a counter I thought this was a restaurant that you ordered at the counter and then took your food and sat down. I wasn't sure if that was an experience I was looking to have. It is in fact a full service restaurant. I was guilty of judging a book by it's cover!   We were greeted by a server who let us know that they were on a 30 minute wait (7:15 ish on a Friday night, which seems about right) but that the bar was open seating and we were welcome to eat in there, grab a drink, or just wait for a table. We decided to wait for a table and we were pleasantly surprised to be sat within about 5 minutes of being there. SCORE!!!  We ordered the Chip and Guac salsa sampler to start with which was awesome. I loved the different salsas that complimented the guac and the chips are always on point! For our main entrees we ordered the chicken enchiladas a couple of carne asada tacos. Everything is so flavorful. I am a huge fan of Otro Cafe especially the flour tortillas which are out of this world AMAZING so I was a little bummed that my tacos weren't wrapped in those heavenly numbers.   The only con's I have to share would be the noise level. With the beautiful construction of the space the noise carries so if you're trying to have a quiet intimate dinner this may not be the place to do that. There is also patio seating which I imagine would be a better option to dine if you're looking for less noise. Parking I can imagine could also be an issue especially as we get into these gorgeous nights that we are so famous for in AZ.   Overall I loved Gallo Blanco's and can't wait to come back and try out some other items on their menu!",

Our drinks took forever to come to the table, the waitress barely checked on us, and I feel like we received the scraps of meat for our tacos. We ordered the different dips for our chips which were pretty good. Then ordered a family size portion of two different meats for our tacos. The pieces were small and greasy so that's all I really tasted. I felt like we had more onion on our plate than meat. I'm willing to give this place another chance since the margaritas were really good.",

The old location had a small bar and a normal full service dining area.  This location bodes a walk up order and sit down area and a bar area which is pretty much the same size.  Gallo Blanco if you are reading this, do your servers or whatever you call them, a favor by making them servers....not order takers.  I don't know how to tip someone who takes my order at the walk up desk.  I also hate this concept that other restaurants like Hop Doddy are using.  As someone who has served I feel bad for the non server servers because I don't know if they actual work off of tips.  The food was great, they charge for chips and salsa, not sure why because I don't believe they used to.    They also took off some food items like your carne asada burrito! WHY?!  I was told this location is only serving corn tortillas... I don't get it, I hope they figure it out.  Used to be our favorite spot.",

But the best of all...I ordered a carne asada taco just to see if it was legit. And this place met my every expectation. I have yet to find a legitimate street taco in this town. They have it here! Add to that the great craft cocktails and specializing in tequila and mezcal plus the ambiance and transformed kitchen and building. It's not in the best part of town but it adds some sparkle to its surroundings. Try this place out!",

I left eating cold rice and basic tacos with no salsa. I wish I would have went someone else for lunch.

The exterior mural, patio, abundance of bike racks, and their name glowing in soft blue light from the plasma cut steel door trim at the entrance gave assurance that this would be a welcoming, fun place for dining and having drinks - and as it turned out, that's exactly what it is. The place was hopping busy for the opening night, and the staff was very friendly and alert. Ordering is done at the counter and after you are given a number sign to place on your table, you seat yourself. It was good to see many of the old favorites on their menu, and I ordered the refreshing Gallo margarita and the Ceviche de pescado. The ceviche was divine - very fresh slivers of fish marinated in citrus, with cilantro, basil, cubes of avocado and slices of cucumber, red onion, jalapeno and cherry tomatoes. This initial visit to the establishment's reincarnation was definitely not a disappointment and of course I'm coming back ... For the longest time I've been craving the elote callejera and the amazing tacos that I remember from their old location and now they are available once more!",

    "text": "I loved the old Gallo Blanco inside the Clarendon Hotel, so was super excited to see them open in a new spot.  Unfortunately, ended up being a complete disappointment.  The new location is really nice, love that they repurposed an old neighborhood supermarket.  For that, I'd give them 4 stars.  But that's the extent of what I found nice about this new location.  The physical set up is confusing as hell.  We are told to check in and then wait for our table, but yet there is no physical space to wait!  We literally had to stand against a wall with diners no more than 2 feet away.  A truly awkward set up.  You're given a table with a # placard on it, you then have to saunter up to a counter to place your order, including drinks.  As you can't sit at the table and casually peruse a menu, this made for a super slow and confusing process.  If you wanted another drink, you had to go back up to the counter to order.  URGGGHHH  After that awful experience, I thought at least I would enjoy our food and drinks.  WRONG.  I loved the food at the old Gallo Blanco and expected the same quality.  My Michelada drink was bad, they literally filled my glass 3/4 with tomato juice, the guacamole was flavorless, the Seafood Cocktail was bland, my salad was soggy with too much dressing and the carne asada tacos were ok, but meat was tough.  I had high expectations and will not be back unless I hear that there is a miraculous turn around.  BTW, you can get full waiter/waitress service if you sit at the bar or in a communal table in the bar area.  If you're on a date night, not a good set up.",

If your vegetarian or vegan this place is not for you. Their taco options was either fish or vegetable tacos which is okay. I wish they had more options for those that don't eat red meat but hey, that wouldn't Mexican. I like their new location, it's very unique and fits all crowds. I wouldn't go here during first Friday though for I assume this place can get packed due to its location. I give this place four stars only because I really do miss their shrimp tacos.",

The asthetics were good.    Didn't like the ordering setup. I know they have full service at the bar, but still.  It took us 30 minutes to get a table. Ordering at the counter was clunky with a few parties ahead of us. Three of us were called up within a few minutes.  Maybe have two people at the counter to take  orders to speed up things?  The food was good, but over priced.  $48 for two beers, some corn (elote), and a taco platter? The elote was $7 for one husk of corn.  We walked away feeling like we didn't get good value.    I applaud the initiative, the location, and the taste, but the logistics will not have us coming back until a change is made.",

The carne asada was grilled to perfection, packed with citrus juiciness and cilantro garlic flavor but the wait time was ridiculous.  Arrived at 4pm on a Sunday, there was maybe 12 people max, including a party of 2 on the patio. We had to go inside (15 min later) and get our own menus after being told it was full service. It took another 10 minutes for someone to come out and get our drink order and then about another 30 min for the food to come out. On top of this, there is a rather large fly infestation on the patio. It's too bad that these setbacks exist because the restaurant is in a cute building , nicely designed with cozy garden decor on the patio. A few margaritas should allow you to look past these things, though.  The margarita was exceptional.",

It's really convenient now that they have there own stand alone location in downtown Phoenix. We made a visit on a Saturday evening for dinner and were seated right away! You do have your choice with sitting in the bar or dinning area, we chose the dining area for this occasion. Very satisfied to see that the menu has not changed since our other visits years ago. For the appetizer I ordered the \"chicharron de queso\" with aioli sauce.If you have never been here or have never tried this appetizer please do not hesitate. It's basically fried cheese rolled up nice and crispy on a plate!  The main meal was the traditional carne asada and barbacoa street tacos that came out in a skillet. I have tried many of places when it comes to street tacos or taco shops and this location by far is the best in town hands down! The cocktails were  a 'la paloma\" (lime, grapefruit and tequila mix) and a mexican whiskey mix that I cannot remember the name of. To go we ordered both a hot and iced coffee that was amazing. I like my coffee black and i could not believe how strong and flavorful the beans were! According to our server the beans are local from Tucson, AZ.  Overall our server was great and attentive! We love the \"chicarron de queso\" so much, that we placed an order to go for those late night cravings! Really happy to see Gallo Blanco back and will be making future visits very very soon!",

My other go-to is the posole soup.   This place is super cute w two dining options. If you sit by the bar area, you get full service but if you go to the other side, you order yourself and they bring out your food. So whatever your preference is.   I highly recommend this place!!!

Kind of an odd location but I feel like that's all good places in Phoenix! I like the little cafe counter area up front. The whole restaurant is pretty cute inside!  They have a good amount of vegetarian food, and the vegetarian stuff is labeled which makes my life a little easier. I was kinda hoping to see a vegetarian burrito or something, but the other options were good so not a problem! I got vegetarian pozole which I've never had before. I also got chips and guacamole with salsa! The soup was really good. We did have to ask about the tortillas it was supposed to come with because they weren't brought out, but when they were I was glad we had brought it up! They were amazing tortillas! The guacamole was so good too, as were the salsas. Not incredibly pricey either, I'd totally come back!",

    "text": "Chef Doug Robson is someone well known enough in this town to bear the burden of expectations.  Gallo Blanco was a breakout sensation back in its original location on the bottom floor of the Clarendon Hotel.  It was relatively small, had a hip modern urban feel, and (while limited in its selection) served quality tacos, tortas and other Mexican staples.  It was so successful that Robson later opened another restaurant in CenPho (Otro Cafe).  After an unknown dispute with the hotel owner however, Gallo Blanco abruptly shuttered in 2015.  Gallo Blanco fans rejoiced when Robson decided to reopen his first restaurant on the northeast corner of 10th Street & Pierce.  But would the new location measure up to the original?  On a Sunday at dinner time, I decided to judge for myself.  The new location is in the century old American Way Market building that had long been abandoned.  Robson has meticulously restored the building into a beautiful space which has patio seating on the east and west ends of the building.  The interior is segmented in two, with the restaurant on the north side of the interior and the bar area on the south side.  I grabbed a seat at the bar area as I was here alone for dinner, but also because of the natural lighting of the windows that look out towards Pierce Street.  Just FYI, here you grab a menu at the front counter and then sit wherever you want.  I had neglected to visit Gallo Blanco when the new location first opened, but that quickly changed after sampling a pancake dessert taco at the Devour Culinary Festival that was out of this world.  Having seen that Gallo Blanco does in fact serve a dessert pancake, that was all the motivation I needed to make the one mile walk over here from my apartment.  But first, let's not get ahead of ourselves.  First there must be a drink.  In this case, I ordered GB's house margarita.  Tequila, triple sec, lime, and agave.  I wouldn't say GB's version is really distinctive in any noticeable way, but a refreshing marg nevertheless.  Now then, let's get some dinner.  I've had GB's tortas, tacos, and even a few burritos back at their old location, so for this visit I decided to take a look at their house specials.  One dish I was curious about was their Pescada Del Dia (Fish of the Day).  Today the fish special was Mexican Grouper.  Sold.  The dish also comes with rice and beans, but not just your a-typical rice and beans.  The rice is jasmine rice mixed with corn, tomatillo salsa and cilantro.  The beans are locally sourced beans from McClendon Farms in Goodyear and are topped with a sprinkling of cotija cheese.  The fish was excellent.  Grilled perfectly with a nice flaky savory finish and the rice and beans were both solid accompaniments.  Now then, let's talk about that dessert.  Sadly, the pancake dessert here isn't the same recipe Doug used during the Devour competition (that recipe incorporated horchata ice cream), but their Flapjacks dessert nevertheless looked like a can't miss.  Two full size pancakes topped with butter, maple syrup, whipped cream, banana, and candied peanuts.  I'm a little disappointed that this dish didn't have any Mexican infused notes like their competition dessert did, but the pancakes were certainly tasty despite that fact.  Total cost for the margarita, food, tax, and tip came to $45.  The food, the prices, and the atmosphere are slightly more upscale compared to other valley Mexican restaurants.  I don't mind paying extra if the food measures up.  In the case of GB's current operation I think the food is worth it...mostly.  You can certainly get great quality Mexican food all over town for cheaper than here.  But between the tortas, house specials, and even the sides, there's plenty here at GB that stands out from its competition.  Between Gallo Blanco and Welcome Diner (which is soon to open its new location across the street from Gallo Blanco), the Garfield neighborhood is now on the map in the valley's endlessly expanding restaurant scene.  Props to Doug Robson for saving a landmark in the process of resurrecting his beloved first restaurant.  Now if he'd just resurrect that horchata ice cream dessert recipe, it'll be full steam ahead.",

It was several hours after the graduation but we called ahead just to be sure we could get a table. It was mid-afternoon so no problem we were told, by the time we left the restaurant after our meal, the tables around us were filling up with the dinner crowd and it is no surprise why! The atmosphere, the food, the service... all impeccable and so unique. The shrimp 'n grits had a special mexican flair, all three college students we brought with us couldn't say enough about the naco tortas, and even my son who is usually a picky eater devoured the carne asada tacos. Suggested by the server was the cocktail Tierra Madre (mezcal, turmeric, and tamarind), it was unique and a refreshing change from the my \"usual\" margarita. Chips and delicious salsa, and churros with three sweet dipping options an added bonus. There was so much on the menu we wanted to try, wish we lived closer so we could come back again. Kudos to Doug Robson, we stumbled upon a gem in Phoenix downtown area, a great surprise after a special family day!",

    "text": "Live in the Garfield District. Own a business on the outskirts of the Garfield District. Drove by the building site for months. Was sooo excited to finally see the restaurant open. I'm within walking distance after all. On August 18th I was there for my second time. The food had been good so far. BUT when I went to take my last sip of wine it was all sediment. The texture of which was a mouthful of dirt or sand. I HAD TO SPIT IT OUT!!! When I pointed it out I was asked if I  drink wine enough so as to expect it!?! Further, the tone and attitude towards me was as if I should have expected it and was stupid for even complaining. I was asked if I thought they did it on purpose! (\"What!?! You think I did it on purpose!\"). I was given an attitude and disgusted looks from the bartender and the waitress. Then they proceeded to talk about me as if I wasn't even there: \"what does she expect a discount?\" First, no I did not expect a discount I expected courtesy and service at a restaurant that I had been looking forward to opening for a very long time. Second, does it matter how much wine I have drank in my life to be able to expect NO DREGS in my glass at a restaurant? Is it too much to expect after tipping 25% for a bowl of guacamole, chips and wine and get up to leave, take my last sip and get a mouthful of sediment that maybe I should not be talked down to like I'm expecting too much?? I hate to label places but, after that treatment and the persons who treated me like that - it seems like a total separatist hipster place where if you're not a hipster you get treated like crap. Or you should be expecting to get treated like crap because it is a hipster place. Not sure which one of those is right.  So looked forward to the opening of this place. BOOOOOO!!!",

Never ever will I make the mistake of giving this mediocre place an opportunity to give them my hard earned money for the worst customer experience.  After waiting thirty minutes for our beverages to be refilled and noticed that everyone that had come in after us was eating,  I asked the server to check on our order. After a few more minutes of seeing her searching the register looking back at us several times she came back with a insincere apology and preceded to explain that the order was not received and asked again for our order.. .. I calmly informed her that we had to leave she became indignant and asked us to wait once again while she brought the manager to speak to us, even before we could leave our seats she ran off to the back of the restaurant and waited for us to exit the place. Not only was the service incompetent but they had the audacity to give us attitude because we  refused to wait and listen to another moron, lol.",

    "text": "So disappointed to be writing this review, as the food is good. But, the service is painfully slow! I have been to this restaurant at least 4 times, and each time the place was almost empty or had a handful of patrons. So the service wasn't much of an issue. Well today was a different story! This time they were packed. Which normally I would be happy for a restaurant but this place was beyond ill prepared for this kind of business. Heads-up if you walk in and this place looks busy, walk out find somewhere else!! Not only did it take over 10 minutes for our waitress to come and take our orders, but took even longer for her to actually come back and ask if we wanted out check! We say yes, she leaves for 15min comes back with NO Checks and says she's having a tough time splitting up the checks on the system so asks us for our bills separately by hand! We give our credit cards bill unseen at this point, cause we have been in the restaurant for over 2 hours now!!! Another 20 minutes go by and still no checks!! I finally walk up to the front and someone else is closing our checks out. He apologizes and says \"system issues\", I told him I could understand that but the waitress said that almost 40 minutes ago. We just want to pay and LEAVE! I won't be going back here again, just not worth it. We used to host an afterwork event here monthly, with so many options in the area we are moving on!",

The Al Pastor burrito was not worth it in my opinion. The manager said it was the normal portions and that no one ever complained about it before in the entire history of the restaurant. I would say after living in Mexico and eating a lot of Mexican cuisine all over the southwest that the Pork missed the mark on taste and texture. There wasn't hardly any meat or beans so it was really difficult to tell but once I searched through the tortilla and found what seems to be seasoned and cut up hot dog, I realized the hipster burrito/Mexican attempt wasn't for me and neither was the passive/ aggressive attitude from the manager. We also had to wait 45 minutes to get food and the place wasn't busy. There are too many good food choices, especially Mexican for me to return. Oh and one more thing if you want any kind of traditional salsa options you won't find it here. I was excited to try this place because of the good ratings but unfortunately my experience was not very good.",

It's blend of al pastor, carne asada, and carnitas demonstrated both a mastery of flavor and texture.  Of the two, flavor is the easier to come by - nearly anyone can follow a clever recipe and achieve positive results.  What separates good from great, then, is texture - which is a product of great technique.  This campechana manages to master both, and the result is incredible.  In a sea of taco purveyors, Gallo manages to rise above - this food is important.  I think we've found the next great Phoenix restaurant.",

A sign would be nice. Food was as good as I remembered. I ordered the elote ($7 a little steep). Really flavorful. I also ordered three tacos ($3.25 EA): Al pastor (my fave- great flavors), carne (ehhhh- ok flavor and chewy), and del Mar (good). I also ordered a chelada to wash it down.

The al pastor, in particular, is the best I've ever had. The homemade telera bread on their tortas is epic. Plus, kids eat free!!!

I had the Huarachi Camponada, a plate full of flavor and the presentation in itself was beautiful. My husband had the padilla dish which came with a stack of fresh corn tortillas, he was very pleased. We shared the banana cream pie and churros. The pie was creamy, there was fresh banana slices, caramel and peanuts as a garnish on top. Super amazing!!!  The churros were fresh and hot that came with three dipping sauces. This cuisine has a new meaning to Mexican food!  I watched the bartender make several different drinks, that looked different from your ordinary cocktails. So far the best find in the Garfield District!",

Not tasting like the typical Americanized ones I've had before which is usually just loaded with cheese but limited flavor. This tasted like authentic Mexican cuisine similar to the ones I've had in Mexico itself. The chicken, sauce, cheese, and toppings were all perfectly balanced and in tune with what I like. Ambiance inside the place had a Mexican look and vibe as well.   Definitely recommend this place!",

The kids cheese quesadilla came out and was blue corn tortilla... at many other restaurants this wild have came out on a standard flour tortilla.   The carne asada Taco also came out on the same blue corn tortilla - wasn't given any other options. The carne asada also had a fishy taste to it.   They charge for chips and salsa. (Half of the chips were burnt)   After the food arrived we were never asked how everything was.   When the check arrived we brought our issues to his attention and he shrugged it off and said well we didn't charge you for it anyways and walked away.",

Everything we had was on point-the tamarind agua fresca was delicious and not too sweet, and both cocktails I had were very well balanced. We started with the guacamole, which was seasoned well, and then I had the legumbres salad and my boyfriend had the fish torta, both of which were excellent. We ended the meal with probably the best churros I've ever had. Our server was very friendly and knowledgeable and helped to guide us through the menu. We can't wait to come back!",

Thursday we were meeting our Spokane friends there for early dinner, and when I pulled up the place was either undergoing renovation or was being dismantled.  I was stunned.  I looked for a sign that would tell me when they were re-opening but found nothing. I asked the folks in Welcome Diner if they knew what was going on and they simply said \"They're closed\".  Does anyone know what's going on?  Is Gallo Blanco closed closed? Or temporarily closed?  Such a great place.  It would be a shame to lose this gem.",

We were seated promptly and offered menus and asked about drinks within a minute or two.   Our server had amazing knowledge of the menu and the preparation of dishes. She also shared her knowledge with enthusiasm which was great to see. My drink selection was fair, the Chelada but others in my party loved theirs. When food started coming I was impressed at each dish. Presentation and flavor was excellent. I ordered the Shrimp and Grits, not a typical item for the menu theme but again a recommendation of or server. It was not at all what I would have expected but in a remarkable manner. Great full flavor and an amazing twist on a typically southern dish.   We will certainly return!",

Started with the Chelada, extra spicy, so good. Had the guacamole, it was fresh and perfectly balanced with flavor: lime, tomato, onion, cilantro. I read an earlier review about wanting to lick the bowl so I ordered it. I was not disappointed and I did want to lick the bowl. The chips were equally delicious. Freshly fried, not over cooked, just the right amount of salt. The burrito was the main course and it was off the charts. It was shredded beef (not the Carne Asada) and oh-so-amazing. The tortilla was crisp but not hard, warm and not soggy, everything about it was perfect.  If you're looking for the perfect meal, this is the place. Worth the 5 minute drive from downtown. Eat here!!!",

The building is a former grocery store that's been remodeled and I headed to the right from the entrance door to the bar that you really can't see when you first walk in to the the restaurant.  It was a little odd to see an old Anthony Bourdain show playing on one of the TVs given what had just transpired.  I'm gonna miss Tony and his take on travel and food.  Gallo Blanco is a place that he would have liked.  They have a full bar, wine, and some pretty good craft beer selections on tap.  I had the La Bomba torta to eat which was fantastic.  Large, meaty, cheesy and a great bun.  The chips were an extra $2 and came with squeeze bottles of red and green salsa.  I enjoyed my lunch and will be back to this corner of the Garfield district in the near future.",

The atmosphere is loud enough so you can have a private conversation without others hearing, but not too loud that you can't hear yourself think.   I ordered the carne asada tacos and churros for dessert. The chef must have been a lifelong resident of flavor town because they were both out of this world! Had a sample of the horchata afterwards which was also really tasty. I highly recommend this place for good quality Mexican food.",

Everything we ordered was good but there were some stand out menu items that deserve an honorable mention. The fries and aji aoili was spicy and flavorful. The chips excelled in crunchiness, thickness and saltiness. The elote was cooked and seasoned well. The tacos were seasoned nicely and bigger than expected. The churros were on par with Mexico City churros!! They were crunchy on the outside and the dough had a great taste. The dipping sauces complimented the churros very well. The favorite beverage at the table was the picosso. The sweetness was there but not overwhelming and the balancing act between the sweet and spicy elements played nicely off each other.",

The salsa they have now is hot hot hot, watery, and in condiment bottles, ehhh.

Stood at the entrance for 5 minutes before anyone acknowledged us, and was told good luck if you can find a table in the bar.  No prob, found a table for our party of 6 that some guests were just leaving. We stacked their dirty plates and sat, and sat, and sat.   10 minutes later I started to approach the bar and was told, someone would be over shortly. 10 minutes after that, a we received water and menus and were told a server would be over to take our orders. As promised, someone did eventually come and take our orders. We had been there long enough at this point to know that we were only going to get one shot, so quickly placed all our drink, appetizer, and food orders at once. 40 minutes after arriving half our drink orders arrived. 10 minutes after that, the last 3 drinks and then finally food.   Those dirty dishes and glasses that were on our table when we arrived? Were there the entire time. And we weren't alone, but the time we left all the bar area tables were covered with dirty plates and empty glasses- ick. Clearly one server and one bartender were just not enough to keep up with the crowds.   Food was OK, but with so many other great Mexican restaurants in town with great food and way better service, will take my biz elsewhere.",

    "text": "Living in California, I am spoiled with amazing Mexican food.  I rarely have the need for Mexican food when I'm traveling (unless I'm in Mexico, obviously, ha!), so when some friends suggested we eat at Gallo Blanco, we were fine with the suggestion but knew Californian Mexican food would surely beat this Arizonan Mexican variety.  Now I'm not so sure who would win that throw down.   The atmosphere of the restaurant was lively without going too far into a bar feel.  No chips are automatically brought to the table, which is probably the smart way to go,  but something I like when eating at my usual Mexican spots.  We had a party of seven so ordered a few bowls of chips and guacamole.  The guacamole was really good.  It had some big chunks of avocado, which is so much better than guacamole that is mashed/mixed up into an overly creamy mess.  The food and drinks here are cheaper than in LA.  Not saying much, I suppose, since a pressed juice can start at $10 in Atwater Village, but still.  I'm not a beer girl, but they even had cans of Tecate for $2!  A few in the party had that, and if you're on a budget, it's nice to have $2 beers!  My boyfriend had the Dragoon IPA, which he enjoyed and at only $7, it was a good deal.    There was a lot of food ordered, but some standouts for me and my group:  * chicharron de queso - this was amazing!  I may dream of it tonight.  A HUGE fried chichuahua and manchego cheese crisp, served with an aji aioli dipping sauce.  (Is recommend ordering this early on, sharing it, and adding bits of it to any salads or sides).   * elote callejero - your standard Mexican grilled corn served with the mayo, cotija cheese, chile and smoked paprika.  The servers offer to shave the corn off the don for you, which is nice and helps make sure you don't look like a messy pig within a few bites.  I can't recall if it came with lime wedges or not, but if not...ask for them.  Mexican corn always needs a squeeze of fresh lime juice!  * de la casa salad - romaine, avocado, cherry tomatoes, pepitas, jicama, cucumber, cotija...very fresh and delicious.  Would have been enhanced had I crumbled some of my cheese crisp on there!!  * Tacos - the big hits with our group was the al pastor and the campechano (this is a mix of longaniza, al pastor and carne asada)   I almost want to plan another trip to Phoenix just for the fried cheese.  Is that weird??",

    "text": "The good, the bad, and the ugly... this wasn't our first experience, but previously only ate at the old Clarendon location.   The good (sort of):  the food is slightly above average Mexican. Good overall. I enjoyed everything we ate (once we finally got it).   The bad: the service!  The bar was insanely slow in making drinks. Our waiter, who overall seemed indifferent and wasn't great, even felt the need to apologize for the drink delays. It was a Saturday night but not insanely busy. The waiter didn't come by very often and was a stereotypical hipster type who seemed indifferent and annoyed that he was there to serve the table. The food runner brought half of our table's food and asked \"anything else I can bring?\"  Yup. The rest of the table's food. The service was incredibly awkward overall. The waiter would correct us at every chance. We would ask for an option in english and he would condescendingly reply back with the menu option... not in a clarifying manner but in a superior-than-thou response.   The ugly: the bathroom. It was 7:30pm on a Saturday night but not insanely busy. The bathroom was gross. Filthy corner, overflowing trash can, gross bathroom fan. If they can't keep the bathroom clean that early in the evening, then what's the kitchen like?  Overall, underwhelming. The wait staff seemed annoyed with every interaction (when you could finally get them to come around). Service slow and awkward. I wouldn't come back.",

We had their tacos . 4 different  meats . We had their sandwich which was really good. Service was so slow . All the tables around  us got faster service. Food was salty. Green chilies  were not spicy. They did comp us one appetizer  for being slow.they did not refill ice tea till we asked. Restaurant  was loud",

A 20 minute wait turned into 45. Drinks were about $10 a person. We had 2 rounds before they called us. Then you get a table assigned. Then you go to the counter and order, then you sit and wait for your food to come. The problem is that the system is so confusing that a ton of people just came in and sat down because there seemed table open. Then they went up and ordered and get their food way before others. I can see this system working at lunch time but not on a Saturday for dinner.  Also, the tumeric and tamarind drink is a no-go. Don't bother with it - totally not worth it.",

    "text": "Maybe First Friday, and their 2nd Friday of being open wasn't the best time to come. We found parking up the street and around the corner. I was confused on where to enter, once in and after looking around the big square shaped room I found my way to a counter. The cashier/hostess told me there was a 15 minute wait. I gave her my order for 2 Pacifico beers and paid 15.00 she gave me a number card and told me they'd bring my beers to me. There isn't a waiting area so I awkwardly  stood against the wall with a few others, hovering over people eating. My husband made his way to the bar and after a few minutes found one available seat. I get that there are kinks to be worked out, and staffing needs to be amped up especially for busy weekends so I maintained a positive attitude. Watching the 3 bartenders work furiously made our 10 minute wait to be acknowledged, fly by. Our beers were brought to us and all was well. Eventually we had a chance to order and the food was good, pricey but good. Description of food; 1. Carne Asada Tacos were tender, perfectly seasoned, small, good corn tortilla and garnished with raw onion/cilantro/lime wedges. You are given 2 plastic bottles one with a green guacamole salsa and the other is red salsa, both great additions to the tacos. 2. Fried Cheese Tower (chichharon de queso) had good flavor and a fun item for your Instagram photos. 3. Paloma Cocktail had a smokey citrus taste to it. All in all I liked the vibe, although a bit hectic and  different than original Gallo Blanco #1 @the Clarendon this new building has  beautiful  character and is a great revitalization to this downtown community. I look forward to coming back on a relaxed day when the wrinkles are ironed out and updating my review to a higher one.",

Configuration of restaurant is also confusing ... In the front part, you order from a counter, but then get to sit at your own table ... the back part is the bar where you get a waiter and table service, but you have to share a table with strangers.

I've had a lot of amazing restaurants in my time, so it's truly hard for me to ever pick just one that would be my favorite. However, I think this could be it...  Incredible drinks, quality and well crafted. Super delicious and unique twists on classics!  All of the tacos were really, really good, each for their own reason!

The tacos is always a must when I dine at Gallo Blanco. I've had their tortas and posole before and it's super delicious. The cocktail menu is great and the restaurant plays good music which makes this place a cool spot to hang with your friends.   Can't forget to mention that the salsa from here is",

The food was very tasty. My burrito was a little tiny (could have had 2) or else this would have easily been 5 stars. I'll have to try something else next time I go.",

One comment was \" there ain't no food truck cook in that kitchen\" I had the chilaquilas. It was a big variation of the original recipe but so good and fresh. The street corn \"wonderful\" ( albeit expensive $7). Tacos authentic and again fresh. The carne asada burrito was filled with seasoned beef, tender and the outside toasted.  The waitstaff was attentive and kept our beverages topped off.  The atmosphere was open warehouse and a bit noisy but clean. The rest rooms were spic and span which to us is sometimes rare.  I highly recommend you give this place a try   I will return and look forward to giving their other restaurant, \"Otro Cafe\" a try too.",

We went with a group of 8, and so we had a big variety of dishes - 3 different types of Tacos (Al Pastor, Carne Asada, Puerco Colorado), Ensalada Corrado Dos with Chicken, Torta Campechano, Ceviche de Pescado, a whole range of kids menu dishes, and chips and guacamole with a whole range of other tasty and flavor-packed dips. Everything was so good, AND, kids under-10 eat for free (each child can pick any two mini-dishes from a list), that was an extra bonus, as we went with 4 kids not knowing that!! Very highly recommended, this will definitely become one of our favorite places in Phoenix!",

And I had one of the best lattes of my life, the cafe miel, which is expresso, milk, honey, and cinnamon! I have tried to recreate this since then, without much success.   As far as food, we ordered the guacamole, the envuelto (omg amazing al pastor folded inside of cheese!), and a couple of tacos (carne asada and barbacoa). I also got a margarita.

Maybe I'm too picky but I grew up in the Mexican culture including a lifetime traveling to Latin countries and I've never seen Chilaquiles like this...     The taste was decent.... I stress \"decent\".  But the consistency and presentation lacked any appeal. Look at the pics!    I'm just traveling through but was looking forward to huevos rancheros or Chilaquiles... very disappointed to say the least.    On the bright side. Other items on the menu looked great (judging from other people's plates). The service was commendable and the employees were very pleasant.    I'll be back though...they seem to really want to make their guests happy and service is BIG in my book.",

She didn't even stop at our table to see if we wanted one more round before happy hour was over. When I finally got her at 6:02pm (happy hour ends at 6pm) She said sorry you missed it, happy hour is over. The restaurant wasn't even packed last night. The food was great!!! I highly recommend trying the house margarita. It was excellent. I tried the ceviche as my appetizer and the bean and cheese burrito. I was satisfied with both. The green salsa is amazing.

    "text": "This is my second time visiting this restaurant, and I must say that I admire the consistency. The carne asada was marinated and grilled to perfection and their campechano tacos tasted authentic which is something that I've been looking for in the Phoenix valley. Along with the consistency of their food, this place has a list of artisan tequilas, mezcals, and other Mexican spirits. I highly recommend grabbing a seat at the bar and asking one of the knowledgeable bartenders to give you an exploratory adventure through their premium agave spirits. If you are a connoisseur of craft spirits, you will not be disappointed.   The price point of the tacos here represents the quality of their products as well as the phenomenal preparation. This is not the place to go if you are looking for a quick cheap taco that costs less than 2 dollars. These tacos are 3.50 each, or you can get a family style dish served on a hot plate with a side of 6 corn tortillas. I recommend the second option, because you are going to want to order more as soon as you put down the first round of tacos. The preparation time for these tacos take time, so patience is essential, but as I keep saying it will be worth every minute and penny.  The ambiance of this place is what you would expect for a hip upscale taco shop nestled in the Roosevelt community. It looks like it's a historical building that was completely gutted and renovated with a fresh wood interior. The open ceiling and floor to ceiling windows produces a warm community-like environment that makes you want to walk around to other tables and make friends. The bar is neatly organized and creates an eye-catching display of all the artisan spirits available for tasting. The exterior of the building adds to the ambiance by remaining to keep its vintage look.   The service is exceptional. Both times I have visited I have sat at the bar. The first time I enjoyed a great mescal that was recommended. (I forget the name, but will be back to get it again.) My girlfriend got a margarita that was balanced to perfection. To eat, I first tried the carne asada tacos and immediately fell in love. I ordered a second round of carne asada and also sampled the campechano which I fell in love with as well. My girlfriend tried the Naco Torta and was more than satisfied. Naco Torta consisted of fresh, ripe avocado, tender carne asada marinated to perfection, an over medium egg, and greens all on a toasted artisan bun. After all of this food, I couldn't help but order the churros with 3 different dipping sauces. The churros were crispy on the outside with a warm fluffy, but dense inside. I personally enjoyed the chocolate dipping sauce, but it also came with a leche, and caramel sauce.  Overall I highly recommend this place to anyone in the Phoenix community. I will now be a loyal customer to this reastaurant because of the quality and consistency of the food, service and of course tequila.",

After seated, waited a good 5 minutes to get water from our hostess on a pretty slow Sunday afternoon. We ended up waiting a total of 25 mins before our server finally showed up and simply says \"you want some food?\" It's like \"naw, we just thought you had nice tables and wanted to check them out!\" Margaritas were too sweet and weak. My girl got a veggie burrito that ended up coming out filled with almost 40% with cheese and oil, chips and quac app is almost a single serving size IMO. I got the half chicken and it was really good, but took another 25-30 minutes to get after ordering. None of this would have been that major if it weren't for the lack of effort on the servers side who showed up at our table maybe 3 times tops the whole night, and even seemed like she was chewing food when approached us one time? I'm not usually one to leave bad reviews, but Gallo used to be my #1. I loved the food and atmosphere at the Clarendon, but i was seriously disappointed by the experience and probably wouldn't risk bringing friends here a second time.",

    "text": "Not the same - AT ALL.  First, let me say I am a huge Gallo Blanco fan. We were easily there weekly at the Clarendon location. Second, I can't rate the food because we couldn't get that far. The venue gives NO consideration to acoustics so it is impossible to hear the staff, or your dining companion. As if this isn't bad enough the stereo system was on so loud the speakers were crackling. Other customers are yelling just to have conversation making the the atmosphere unnerving. As we stood in the slow moving line to order we contemplated the all Spanish, one word per item wall menu. Thinking the paper menu would lend some descriptions, explanations, hints or clues, about the food, we grabbed one only to find the same brief one word items. Focusing on those in front of us, we quickly realized the staff was spending time explaining the menu slowing the ordering process to a halt. We waited a few more minutes and moved on. I didn't anticipate having to run some sort of loyalty gauntlet to continue patronizing a restaurant that at one time actually considered the customer experience. Not sure what they might be thinking with this business model, but they should revisit the topic.",

If the server would of said that from the beginning it would of made sense but she apparently didn't know the menu. NOW, back to the lady in charge... I wasn't even upset.. the rice was still good just cold... I let her know the situation and all she could say is \" well...that's why I'm over here now to let you know\" it was all with attitude.

    "text": "We went here for dinner tonight and we were majorly disappointed. We had been looking forward to the new Gallo Blanco for so long as we were major fans of the original one! I like that they have found a cool place in the Garfield neighborhood - it's nice and quiet, plenty of area to park in, although I think if I lived in the area I might not be as happy with the extra traffic. Foot traffic was light we were able to order right away, but the menu on the big board leaves much to be desired. And it took a while to figure out what was there. I will say I was disappointed to not see Queso Fundido on there! Hubby had a michelada, which tasted like tomato juice with a splash of beer. They were nice enough to bring him extra beer free of charge. Without the queso fundido available, we tried the Envuelto. It was okay. For the amount that you got, the $12 seemed a little overpriced for the location and set up. We followed it up with the Naco torta, which used to be my favorite thing at the original. I was wanting it to have so much more flavor! :( There was nothing Mexican about it, except for the fact that it was named a torta.  Overall, we were happy with the service, but it felt weird to leave a tip when ordering our meal at the beginning given that you order at the counter. And it's the reason for the 3 stars. The service throughout our meal was great though. The food though left so much to be desired and we left majorly disappointed. Most of the flavor seemed to come from the grease/oil and not from seasoning/spices. There actually seemed to be minimal seasoning throughout.  We'll probably be sticking with Otro Cafe, although I for sure miss the Original Gallo Blanco.",

Plenty of gluten-free options, great drinks and OMG the guacamole. Top 3 Mexican joint in Phoenix, easy. Imma keep it short and sweet - this place rocks ya'll.",

    "text": "First time at Gallo Blanco.  My spouse had heard of this place before so we gave it a try.  The decor and ambiance is great.  Parking can be quite a challenge.  It was a busy Saturday afternoon and were seated quickly, but had no server acknowledge us fo about 7mins. The chips and salsas were delicious, the chips are the real deal, none of those thin Chili's type of chips.  I am very particular about my guacamole and I must say it was very good. My spouse ordered a torta and he loved it.  Now my order on the other hand fell flat.  Being hispanic I always find a sense of happiness when I see chilaquiles on the menu.  I knew exactly what i wanted as soon as I locked eyes on the chicken chilaquiles.  When my dish arrived i was dumb founded and thought \"ok i think there was a mix up, i did not order a tostadas!\" The chilaquiles came in a layer of 3 tostadas with cheese chicken and a green salsa.  Besides finding it difficult to cut it up and eat it, the flavors were just not what you would think they would be when thinking if chilaquiles. Im giving this place a 4 star because even though i did not like my dish i know other things on the menu will probably be good. At the distance I saw other great dishes so i will be back to try something new like the pozole and the mexican corn most definitely.",

My review is mostly about the food we tried. we ordered a pastor burrito, torta asada, and the ceviche pescado. 1st the burrito was OK. it had a nice taste but was rather small for the price. it could have used some more ingredients for more taste. 2nd all the same goes for the asada torta. The ceviche was delicious but the portion was way to small for $15. I saw more plate than ceviche and i finished it pretty quickly. the homemade chips & salsas are very deliscios",

    "text": "I will start with the good.  The carnitas taco was amazing.  Nicely seared chunks with excellent seasoning.  Just spectacular.  The salsas were also delicious.  Perfectly balanced and fresh.    We ordered la charola, pastor and carnitas tacos, side of beans, an agua fresca, and michelada.  The beans were good.  The pastor was okay.  The michelada was not up to par and the agua fresca was decent.  For everything it was about 40 bucks with a tip.  I really don't feel it is worth it.  3.25 for a 4 bite taco is just crazy.  I am a taco connoisseur.  I make them weekly and have had them all over the southwest.  As good as the carnitas were, 3.25 for one small taco just doesn't fly for me.  Also 9 bucks for a tiny thing of guac and 3 very small salsas and a small bowl of chiops doesn't make sense to me either.  The beer selection for the michelada was so non-existent the counter clerk didn't even ask.    Also, if you are going to order at the counter and seat yourself the prices should be on par.  I think that may have been the biggest issue.  It's pay at the counter and seat yourself but they are charging full on restaurant prices and then asking for tips.  I guess none of it made any sense to me.    I used to love the old Gallo Blanco and was very excited they reopened so as painful as this is to write if I am keeping it real this new concept just ain't for me.",

I took a seat at the bar and Andy introduced himself and the rest is history. His food suggestions were amazing. The local craft beer paired perfectly...and the grilled corn...let me just say if I lived in Phoenix I would have it three times a week.

    "text": "Sad day at El Gallo... first time for us at the new location. I was so looking forward to it - I was a die hard fan at the old spot and couldn't WAIT to have a Naco Torta and some of their amazing ceviche and guac again. No one does carne asada like El Gallo Blanco (it's rumored the marinade has Coca Cola in it - the hint of sweetness is fantastic). But we had a deeply regrettable service experience and sadly, they're not doing the ceviche like they used to.   I should preface this by saying that the place was busy - it was lunch time on a Sunday and things were hopping (good to see). But there were a couple empty tables and the frenzied pace of the servers and bartender appeared to be the result of a poor strategy/training more so than truly being slammed.  Put our names in for a table and went to the bar to grab a drink while we waited. Bartender totally ignored us for a good ten minutes! Walked around to another spot to see if it was a visual problem and asked if we could order margaritas - she told us she was \"40 drinks back\" and refused to take our order! We waited for another 10 minutes and were able to secure seats at the bar when a few patrons vacated... but even THEN she would not take our order. No apologies - she was brusque, exasperated and rude, and busied herself with twelve things at all times, but none of them were seeing to her customers. She spent a lot of time gathering empties, stacking glasses, and replenishing items behind the bar when she could have been communicating, pouring drinks, and making guests feel welcome. She didn't appear to have any interest in the latter.  Finally got a waitress to help us, but she also came off as somewhat resentful that we were asking for food and drinks! It took her another 10 minutes after we spoke to her to come back and take the order, and we had to ask three times for water. (The bartender could have at least tossed a couple of waters down for us!) Our waitress ended up making our drinks herself; the bartender was still too busy cleaning off the counter to bother. Order was placed a good half-hour after we arrived. Unacceptable. And the attitude was worse.  I hope management realizes there's a problem with training and perhaps hiring strategies... this could be a favorite spot but not with these service issues.   Also - bring back the ceviche from the original menu - it was to die for! The new stuff is just OK.",

Cat is a lovely and friendly employee with great tips on ordering. She also gave me tips to help me since I am trying to give up meat. I will return for sure. And, I may host a happy hour here. Great vibe.",

    "text": "Finally got to check out the new location on a Saturday afternoon around 1:30pm. The industrial vibe is no frills, bright, and laid-back. When we arrived, the full-service bar area was pretty packed, but the counter-service side had plenty of open tables and no line.   The service was quick and efficient. The food was incredibly fresh. The music was on point.   I can imagine that the ordering system could possibly get complicated during the rush (in regards to some of the feedback on the other reviews and tips), but all I know is that I had a steaming bowl of vegetarian pozole that was so flavorful it made me want to weep spicy, delicious tears. That in itself will keep me coming back.",

Unfortunately that was not the case.  The seating is open and I loved the decor and the vibe.  My son and I ordered our drinks and some chips and guacamole to start.  They brought my beer, the chips and guac.  They never brought my sons drink and the server never came back to take our order.  She however did visit every table around us at least twice in the process.  After about 30 min or so I walked up to the register and asked for the check. Clearly my business wasn't appreciated.  The food might have been delicious but the service ruined it for me.",

    "text": "I was not as impressed as my many co-workers. We ordered for 8 for an 11:30am pick up and they let us order early that was nice. I always love it when restaurants can accommodate and do a good job with large orders. They did forget two sides we ordered but no one missed it. I had three tacos: carne asada (good flavored meat), campechano (yummy), and since they have a lot of VG and GF I thought I order a veggie taco (disgusting it was beats and onion). The green and red salsa was good. The guac had pineapple in it, its always weird to me when they do that but I prefer spicy food. We also had the Charron de Queso which just looked like burnt cheese that was odd. I would not go there again, overpriced and flavors not fit for me. If my co workers want it again ill pressure for something different but wont die if we get it. PS: The postres were actually good (coconut pudding; lime tart; tres leches). :)",

    "text": "After reading recent article in AZ Republic, this sounded like perfect spot to try authentic Mexican food.  Spot on!!  My daughter and son-in-law are visiting from Atlanta.   When they visit we always seek out True Mexican food, so tonight we trekked downtown to find Gallo Blanco. Our expectations, fueled by the article in the Republic, were high.  As we left with delightfully full tummies, we all agreed our expectations had been exceeded.    I had the Huaraches  Campechana as my entree despite it being listed as an appetizer on the menu.  It was absolutely delicious and definitely an adequate portion for an entree for one.   My son-in-law had two tacos; one with carne asada the other the campechana, a mix of carne asada, al pastor and carnitas.  He says they were the best he'd ever had.     My daughter had never had chilaquiles, so she ordered same and absolutely loved it.   She also ordered a side of quac and was stunned at the huge portion.   Also very good.   We finished off the meal by sharing an order of the churros and an order of the plantain pie.  OMG for both!!!   So good.    We sat in the bar where full table service is offered.  We had excellent service with a very knowledgeable server, Kris.    We will be back!!!",
