The dough nugget are alright, I personally think they could use more garlic butter sauce, but they give you a lot of them.  Delivery took a little bit over an hour, but they redeemed themselves with their delicious pizza.  We can't wait to go there and try their deep dish pizza.  We will definitely be repeat customers, maybe not for delivery because it takes too long, but we'll definitely be back for more.",

    "text": "Being so close to Rosati's I've always wanted to try their food. The reviews have kept me away, but when GroupOn offered a deal, I figured this would reduce my risk.   As a fan of thick crust, I ordered the \"Double Crust\" Deluxe Pizza and a Meatball Sandwich. I will say the pizza toppings were quality, the amount of cheese and flavor respectable. However, what makes a pizza is the crust, and I'll say I've had better crust on frozen pizza. The actual crust was more of a cracker like consistency, and was barely higher than the toppings. And the clincher was, I couldn't even pick up the pizza without the toppings and cheese falling off. Pizza isn't hard to make and they failed.  The Meatball Sub was a little better, again the ingredients were tasty, but the bread--soggy, wouldn't stay together. Eat it with a fork. Oregano's Meatball sub is far far better for the same price.   Sorry Rosati's I wanted to like you, but there's too many better choices--even if I have to drive further.",

If your service sucks or you have a bad experience, try tipping more. This holds True to just about any restaurant.   Behold the power of the 30% tip.  To recap: I know no one that works here, have only ordered here 4 times, and they treat me like a close friend when I call.  My food gets here incredibly quick (20 - 30 minutes when they quote an hour) and they usually hook me up with free delivery and little odds and ends they think I'd like (free mozzarella sticks, some breaded mushrooms).",

When we called back to see what they could do for us, we were told that the best they could do is half off our next order. (There wouldn't be another order if the food and service left a bad impression.) We were then told that they could remake it for us and we could get the standard thin crust, but when we were about to complete the order, they told us it be $13.00+!!! We canceled and I'm disappointed that I am now left with $25.00 worth of food that we aren't even going to touch. They must be crazy to expect that I'm going to pay more for something that wasn't pleasant to eat from the beginning.",

    "text": "Until I get a return call from a manager I cannot give more than 1 star. I have coming to Rosati's awhile since I moved into the neighborhood a few years back. I typically do pick up because I've noticed deliveries are usually a mess. Even when doing pick up I ALWAYS have to remind them of things - \"I paid for an extra ranch\" (which is a must if more than 1 person is eating), \"I ordered a bottle of soda\", \"The person on the phone said 45 min and I've been waiting an extra 1/2 hour over that amount of time... just sitting here\".   It's walking distance from my house but since the weather was crappy I decided to have them deliver so I wouldn't have to leave the house. Even more disastrous than the pick up issues. The order was wrong and cold... I mentioned I live walking distance? Literally a 3 minute drive away - no idea how food could possible get cold that fast. I called and asked them to return with the part of my order they forgot - they said it would be another 30 minutes along with a laugh at my frustration (more than once). I asked if it would be that long that they just return with my money and I'd give them the food back.   I asked to speak to a manager - they gave an over-explanation of how the owner went home with family health issues. After asking that a manager call me when back in the girl (Valerie) magically changed her mind and decided it would be only 15 minutes (still ridiculous).   20 minutes later they called me back to let me know they didn't have my address, and 10 minutes after that I finally had my complete cold, mediocre meal. With a rude 2nd delivery on top of all that. After the phone argument I don't even trust to eat it.  Don't go here. The pizza is only okay and by the time you even get your food you could make your own pizza from scratch.   You'll notice they never reply to negative reviews on here - it's because they have no excuses for the bad customer service and they have no intention of fixing it.",

We both went for calzones. I figured it was the easiest way to ensure it was vegetarian.  WRONG.  Not only did it take over an hour to show up, AND they charged us a delivery fee (so two calzones became over $20!), but the sauce had a very heavy meat taste. One bite, and I couldn't eat anymore. Not only that, but because they put the sauce IN the calzone as well as on the side, I couldn't eat anything.  I tried to nibble the crust.  My partner, who is not veggie, LOVED her calzone, and killed in in about 5 minutes. Both of us then spent the rest of the evening in bed, moaning and groaning with stomach aches, and there may have been a few trips to worship the porcelin gods as well.  Fail.",

    "text": "Good stuff:  they're open until 2am on the weekends and will deliver to almost that time.  I know there's a thing with the various Rosati's around town, like some owned by one branch of the family and others owned by another branch of the family....I'm not quite sure how it shakes out except that this one and the one at I-17 and Thunderbird seem to be run the same and have the same food so those are the only two I go to.   Oh, yeah, the food.  So, I'm from Chicago, which is where this chain began, and that also means that I am extremely particular when it comes to pizza.  And I don't know where the mythology started that \"Chicago style\" pizza is thick crust or pan?  No.  The original Chicago style pizza is actually served on a thin crust and cut into squares.  The secondary Chicago style pizza, that actually didn't really take off until maybe the late 1970s/early 1980s, is what folks around here call \"deep dish\" pizza but is actually in Chicago referred to as \"stuffed.\"  There's your food history lesson for today.  So the quintessential Chicago style pizza is a thin crust topped with Italian sausage.  CRUMBLED Italian sausage (to those doofuses who want to slice it).  And, quite frankly, Rosatti's is the only place in town that does it worth a hoot.  Now there's that new place, Lou what's-his-name, but I never went to his place in Chicago and to be quite honest, I'm not rushing to try his place here.    So, bottom line:  the pizza at Rosati's is authentic and delicious Chicago-style pizza.  Also, their Italian Beef is the only beef in town besides Portillo's that's worth eating.  Case closed.  PS:  There are some places around that make these things, I think they might call them wood-fired pizza or some such thing?  Places like Fired Pie and I don't know who else.  Some of them turn out some food that is quite delicious.  But I'm sorry, unless it has a tomato sauce, Italian sausage (or in rare cases pepperoni) and mozzarella cheese, it is not a pizza.  Whatever it is may be delicious, but it is not a pizza.  Just so ya know, ya' know?",

    "text": "We placed an order through door dash and it gave us about an hour delivery time (10:15), which is fine.  There was a thing that showed us where the restaurant was in the delivery process i.e. Preparing, out for delivery etc.   At around 10:20 we called and they apologized and said they were busy and they \"didn't know\" when we should expect our food.  As I'm writing this review, it's 10:35 and we still haven't received our food.   I enjoy the pizza here, I just don't think I'm gonna try delivery again.  Dine in only from here on out.  It's a shame, I recommended this place and everybody else wanted Venezias.  Now their first Rosatis experience is a negative one.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I stop at Rosati's on Thomas Road fairly often. Last weekend we ordered our usual pizzas and sat in our usual booth to wait. After about 20 minutes it became clear that our order had fallen through the cracks, so we inquired and were told that the food would be right out. Well, they screwed up the order, took too long, and gave us the wrong pizza. When we pointed this out to the manager, she was very polite and worked very hard to rectify the mistake to our satisfaction.   It's one thing to make a mistake, but it's quite another to fix that mistake and take care of your customers like Rosati's did in our case. Sure, we lost a few minutes, but the staff worked very hard to make sure that the problem was fixed. This was the first time we'd ever had a problem at Rosati's, and they made certain everything was okay. I know lots of people like to complain, but this Rosati's location did fine by us, and we'll be visiting again soon.",

    "text": "I've been craving pizza and Rosati's seemed like the perfect place to satiate that need. We had a promotional discount for a thin crust pie with two toppings. Seemed like a great match for a Friday night.   Driving up we realized this was more of a joint to call ahead and take the pie home. No biggie tho, the pizza was delish! There are a few tables inside, with very basic fluorescent lighting and close proximity to the register . (There are a few iron wrought tables outside.  I may have missed if there were napkins or supplies there.)  The cashier asked if we had called ahead. (Super chipper and pleasant.) The toppings aren't listed on the wall so we stepped aside to review the menu. The wait time was approximately 20 minutes. Everyone was super helpful and nice.  I have no basis for comparison of a Chicago thin style crust pizza. I hail from New York. I can tell you this thin crust pizza was crunchy and cut into perfect squares and I very much enjoyed it.   My topping options were equally distributed underneath the cheese. (I went with pineapple and jalapenos). There weren't any goopy sections in the middle where the pie crust wasn't crispy. Yum!  I'd definitely do this again.",

I can understand a little of it on the cheese side, but needless to say, it was on the entire pizza, and the kids would not eat it. So we had to make an additional trip to Whataburger for the kids, and spend $11, since we live in Scottsdale. So our $24 pizza ended up costing $35, and by the time we got back with the burgers, the pizza was cold and had to be re-heated.",

Went in for a hot dog and fries which at most on a super busy day should take 10 mins. I waited 15 mins even after when purchasing the girl at the front told it me since it was a hot dog it would only take 5 minutes. It was hot in there I mean easily 100 degrees. Why no air conditioning? There was about 10 employees yet nothing ever got done. So many people standing around and doing nothing. Manager not directing anyone on what to do. I saw someone else cancel their order so I did too but not because the wait but because I only saw one person in the whole place wearing gloves while preparing food. Its so disgusting to think of them sweating and wiping and touching the food. This place needs some new direction. Something. The open fridges they use to store ingredients I can almost guarantee are not at the right temperature at that heat on the inside. The ones in Chicago were never this bad but this one is easily the worst establishment I've seen in AZ try to serve food.",

She said she'd check with the manager and call me back. She offered a forty percent discount. Terrible offer.   We reheated the pizza, which of course is not the same as a fresh pie, only to bite into an ingredient we didn't order. And reheating an Italian beef sandwich doesn't work.  I promised this review.

When my pizza arrived the guy seemed in a big hurry, so much so that he didn't even check to see if I had given him the right amount. I had also given him a tip. So I took the pizza inside and opened it to find it was a scrambled mess. Part of the pizza was stuck to the top of the box and the rest was all piled in a heap in one corner. I was not a HAPPY CAMPER and was ready to give them a bad review but decided to call and give them a chance to redeem themselves. The lady was very appoligic and offered to have my order redone and delivered. About 30 minutes later my pizza was delivered by a different driver who was very apologetic. He took the scrambled pizza, appologized again and left.  The pizza was very good and the Customer Service was excellent. I \"may\" even order again but maybe next time I will pick it up myself.",

The Alfredo was delicious and the portion size is enough for 2 maybe 3 meals. The bad....the cheesy garlic bread was just ok..I would not order it again.  Tonight 9/24 I ordered mozzarella sticks, which tasted like an inexpensive frozen brand from your local market....will not order again. I also ordered penne & grilled chicken a la vodka, which was just as delicious as the Alfredo that I had ordered last week. Again the portion is enough for 2 or 3 meals.  I finally figured out an appetizer that is perfect for me....the fried zucchini....yummy. My go to order is the fried zucchini with either the fettuccine Alfredo with chicken or the grilled chicken a vodka. Always delish and always hot (delivery)!!!!  10/22 - I have to change my rating of a 4 to a 3 . As I previously stated I order the same thing every time - with that being said this is the 3rd time I ordered penne & grilled chicken a la vodka - on line when you order that prompts you to choose a size regular or family size. The problem is that when you choose regular - the ticket that they receive at the restaurant comes thru as regular pasta. Now the first time I ordered this, a girl called to clarify. The 2nd time, I didn't receive a call, but I did receive the correct pasta. Today I didn't get a call and I got just plain pasta.  I'm not happy at all, I immediately call and explain the situation..the girl on the phone doesn't seem to care about their mistake, it's their website that produces the wrong ticket. I was like well I need to talk to your manager. She comes back stating here manager is busy but she can give me credit for my next order or I can have a new order for the correct food sent out. Ummmm, I want my food. She's says they are working on updating the website, but clearly it's NOT fixed....lesson to myself if I even order again is to call the order in!!! Let's see what happens when my food gets here....to be continued! My food was delivered hot and correct!!!! So maybe I will give them back the 4 stars and just NOT order online anymore!!!!",

The Godfather pizza's ingredients were Italian sausage, fresh garlic, grilled onions and Rosati's hot giardiniera. The pizza was more spicy than the wings and we loved both!   We ordered off of GrubHub, which gave us a $3 (delivery fee) discount for spending over $20. I really enjoy using GrubHub because I can pay for the food and tip with my credit card ahead of time. The delivery boy was also very friendly which I appreciated.   I did sign up for coupon offers, but the other discounts did not seem very appealing to me. While it is pricier than I usually spend we received amazing pizza and wings, so this will be a once in a while treat for us. Quality over quantity!  *Also, I know we ordered a big order of wings, but they did not skimp on the ranch sauce which means a lot to me! I hate when pizza places get greedy with the sauce. The delivery driver also offered extra cheese and pepper packets for us also.",

Tonight I ordered a 14 inch Chicago style deep dish pizza. What I got was a pan pizza with an end-crust as high as a Chicago style deep dish but a pan style crust inside.   The crust along the bottom was very thick, like, Pizza Hut pan pizza thick. I was able to see where the dough was folded under to make it so thick. I didn't even bother trying to eat the edge of the crust because I already ate twice the amount of crust I ever wanted to.   I will NOT order a deep dish pizza from here anymore. The deep dish used to be great here but I will try to get my deep dish pizza from the new place under construction near Indian School and 36th St.  On the positive, the flavor was good.",

Before this, I honestly didn't think that the famous pizza joints in Chicago could be beat, but now, I seriously think otherwise!!! {Yum, my mouth is watering just writing this post.} The slices are so big that you can literally be full after 1 slice! A small deep dish will definitely feed 4 people.",

First of all, I was amazed at how many staff members were there just milking the clock, not even taking orders while disregarding the line of customers. I wonder what Cory (owner) thinks about that. As I realize this, I start taking a look at the cleanliness of the place, and it was nowhere to be found, the place was filthy. With that staff they should at least be able to wipe the counters.  My 12\" pizza took about 30+ minutes to get done, because they probably forgot to make it in the first place. The guy working the oven didn't seem to realize that the longer the oven stays open, the longer it will take the pizza to bake. He was just playing with the pies, and the oven stayed open about 4/5 of the time.  By the end of the worst pizzeria experience I've ever had, I wanted my money back.... it took them another 10 minutes just to produce a \"voided\" receipt. I saw grown men working there who couldn't process a simple money back request. You only had one job... I feel sorry for the owner, he's losing money to a mediocre staff.",

First thing looking at the menu I really liked the variety of pizzas, appetizers and toppings you are able to order. +  After ordering I found the operator imputed my address in wrong and it took a little over an hour an twenty to get the pizza. I understand it was an honest mistake but didn't feel good.  Down to the pizza! The pizza I went with was the deep dish pep and sausage. Great choice!!! This was a legit deep dish pizza. A great blend between the meat and the sauce. The crust was thick like I like it! The pizza was cooked to perfection and wasn't affected by the delay with my order. Have to say I will DEFINITELY BE ORDERING AGIAN!   Hope the feedback was helpful.... Enjoy fellow yelpers!!!",

There was some confusion about my order and I ended up waiting an extra 20 minutes--I was very hungry and so the initial news about having to wait extra time did not sit well with me at first. After a bad day, I realized I was visiting Rosanti's for their sauce and I decided not to let this confusion bother me. I was understanding and the staff was very accommodating and offered an apology and a sizable discount I couldn't refused. I was willing to pay full price despite the extra wait, but the staff went above and beyond and promptly remade my pizza and provided phenomenal service. I came to Rosanti's for the food but I walked away with an awesome experience.",

Sunday evening after working on outdoor projects around the house and to tired to cook we ordered pizza for delivery from Rosati's on Thomas at 5:30pm which I have been doing for at least twice a month for the past 9+ years.  I have their number stored in my cell phone. I headed back to finish my projects leaving my phone inside the house.  Checking periodically for the delivery driver.  Around 7:15, now really hungry I went to call them to check on our pizza.  This is when I noticed I had a missed call from them at 6:15.  I immediately called them back asking where is my pizza and why the call back.  This is when the lovely Samantha got on the phone with me.  She told me we were out of their delivery zone.  Hum, I had just ordered pizza from them the week before on Saturday evening, so my reply was \"WHAT!!?!\".  This is when our conversation turned ugly.  She told me the girl who took my order was new. So, why would this matter to me?  Then she informed me the head delivery guy said I was out of his delivery range.  Then she proceeded to tell me that they have  moved, under new management, etc.  Her voice escalating and arguing with me.  Does any of this matter, seeing I have been ordering the same way for the past 9+ years and the most recent being 8 days before.  SAMANTHA, GO GET HOSPITALITY TRAINING!!!!  New owners, you will not stay in business very long if you let people like Samantha run their mouths.  What happened to customer service?",

It's near my work, so most of the time I go here, but I was at the one on Power road twice and twice the sides of the pizza collapsed (a sign that they don't know how to construct the pizza) and the breaded mushrooms were too dark on the outside and raw on the inside. There is nothing quite as lovely as raw batter surrounding your mushrooms.  I also went to the one in Chandler once, the pizza was ok, but the staff wasn't very friendly. I had my 3 yr old grandson with me and when he smiled at a staff member, the guy looked at him like he had three heads. I'm not saying gush all over the kid, but damn a smile wouldn't hurt.   I do recommend that you only get the pizza though. I tried a chicken sandwich once and it was awful.",

The girl at the register basically ignored me and didn't make eye contact.  Just kept typing on their computer system.  Then the second employee comes in shows frustration because a driver left food on the counter.  Picks it up and throws it down . She continues to walk back in forth trying to get a hold of the driver.  Sorry Mario the driver.  Looks like you messed up.",

    "text": "I've been there twice in the past week, both experiences were underwhelming. The first time was in the afternoon around 6pm. I ate at the restaurant. A cashier sat me at a table, got me a drink, but never came back to take my order. I had to go and place my order at the cash register, which wasn't a big deal. I place the order, an Italian beef with hot peppers. I go back to my table, but there is now an employee sitting at my table eating pizza. I still had my glass of soda on the table. This struck me as odd. The employee was a grown man in his 40's, so it's not like this was a naive teenager, this guy should have known someone was sitting at this table already. The food was good though, the sandwich was exactly what I wanted. I ordered takeout last week, same order, but when I got home, I saw that they had given me a sausage sandwich. They said they'd give me a credit for the cost of an Italian beef sandwich, but I told the woman that I got it on garlic bread with hot peppers, which is more than the cost of the basic Italian beef. She said I'd have to pay the difference, that they'd cover the Italian beef, but I'd have to pay for the cheese, garlic bread, and hot peppers myself. I think this place serves good food when they serve the correct order, but this place is managed poorly. Customer service takes a backseat here. Even when I placed the order at the cashier during my first visit, I saw a woman sitting on the counter in the back. She was wearing a Steelers shirt, not sure if she even worked there, but it's not a good look to see people sitting on counters, not doing anything. This place just needs a few tweaks and they'll be fine.",

My boyfriend and I always get half-and-half and it just seems like no matter what they could not get it right. When you walk in the girl with the pink dreads is always rude asf with a sourpuss face and they are slow to greet you. At least 3 Times they forgot the additional toppings such as ranch and cheese which are essential for me to enjoy the pizza. Finally, to top it off the most recent time my total for delivery came to $25 (over the phone I informed them I'd be paying cash) I had two $20s, the driver shows up after and hour and 15 minutes with NO change and had a fit that I wouldn't give him the $40/tip him the $15 and then tried to take the pizza back. 100% will not be buying from here again.",

This place is doing dragging the name through the mud. I ordered (2) 18\" pizzas (pepperoni on one, 1/2 giardiniera peppers 1/2 cheese on the other) and some wings which came to $78 before any tip. That seemed a bit high, but good food is worth it. This was not good food. First, the giardiniera was mostly jalapenos. If you don't know, giardiniera is supposed to have sport peppers, not jalepenos, and has a completely different flavor. Second, the sauce was a plain tomato sauce out of a can. No flavor at all. Third, the crust was about as thick as NY pizza and undercooked. Papa John's would've been better. Don't make the mistake I did of ignoring the terrible reviews. This place has earned them.",

We have never had any problems (minus having to wait quite a bit longer than what was told our pick up times would be) until the other day. I had a pretty large order totaling about $175.00. Everything was great, went to pick up the food and everything was actually ready on time. The cashier went over the receipt and made sure all the food was there. Drove the 10 miles back to work, started to undo the bags (which are stapled shut) and what do you know, there is a Rosatis salad missing along with a second side salad we had. Upon opening the pizza box, one of the pizzas was supposed to have been thin crust but all of the pizza was regular crust. I called Rosatis back immediately, the cashier talked to the cook who admitted to making the pizza normal crust. Also we sere charged for \"double dough\" on the meat mania pizza, however we did not ask for a double dough, but it was also just made with a regular crust. I asked if we would get a credit for this and the cashier said she cant offer a credit so i requested to speak to the manager. The manager (Javier) got on the phone, i explained again what happened. He was willing to only give a $20.00 credit for the inconvenience. There were two salads missing and 2 incorrect pizzas. The pizzas we ordered were more than $20.00 each. I didn't understand why they would give less credit than what the value of what I ordered. I asked since they are crediting me less, they should step up their customer service and deliver the food that was made incorrectly and not even given to me period due to the inconvenience. Javier then said \"oh god, are you serious?\" I have never had such horrible treatment from a manger, Javier then said he was not the manager. I asked to just speak with the manager and Javier said \"fine how about a $30.00 credit.\" Finally after requesting for a good minute to speak with the manager Javier then said there was no manager there and told me that the managers name is Johnny but wouldn't be in until the evening. I do no understand how this company can have such horrible customer service.",

    "text": "I usually don't bother writing a review on \"quick\" food types of places because I usually feel pretty neutral about it, kind of like just whatever... But it was late, like 10:30 and I was desperately craving a meatball sandwich. This place was the only place open AND on the plus side they delivered so I gave it a shot. I didn't expect much, just wanted anything with meatball and marinara (I get these cravings you know) and I ordered a meatball sandwich and the breaded mushrooms. First let me say the girl who took my order was very sweet and didn't seem bothered by my late ordering and not knowing the menu (especially considering her shift was probably coming to an end) and second the delivery was VERY fast considering they've never been here and it's really hard to find because there's no sign that says the name of my apartments and the address number is no where to be found on the building either (it's a small place tucked behind a few business and houses, sometimes I wonder how I even get my mail) anyways.. The sandwich was great, I figured end of night I was probably going to get the last of whatever's been cooked already but to my surprise it tasted very fresh. Most of all I was impressed with the meatballs, I'm usually disappointed with most meatballs from most places, but was thrilled to find that these were good ones. They were big, hearty, and tasted like they are homemade. Even if they are not, they are better than most, that's for sure. The sandwich had just enough sauce, not too much to where the sandwich was too messy & to soggy. Enough to where I could eat the whole thing with my hands (like a sandwich should be eaten) and without the sauce & insides falling out all over the place. I was not too impressed with the mushrooms because they were watery when I but into them & kind of bland. But that meatball sandwich was so freakin awesome that I might actually just start ordering them again, from here obviously, because I know I won't be disappointed and on top of that they are only $6 bucks. That is a smokin deal for this one and I can tell you it blows subway out of the water. Next time I'm feeling \"meatball\" anything I'm going to order from here, maybe try something new next time but definitely something with meatballs. They really nailed it! Yay!",

Finally, after an excuse me, she helped us.  Maybe their other food is good, but the salads were horrible.  There was about a 1/2\" of water in the bottom of the bowls, the large salad I ordered was the same size as the dinner salad at twice the price.  Whatever they put in it was awful tasting.  I would not recommend, at least the location at 40th St & Bell to anyone.",

We got a flyer on our door with a menu and a special offer of 3 free side orders if we ordered one of their specialty pizzas as he guarenteed we'd become second time customers.  Not going to happen.  As soon as I smelled the pizza I just though of Pizza Hut and it tasted just the same.  Rosati's gets an A for effort but I will be sticking to Mamma Mias for a cheap pizza plus joint that's close to home.",

Cheese sticks you can't really mess up, and the wings were pretty good, I got the chipotle bbq. The pizza on the other hand, well the toppings were good, I got the bbq chicken, but the crust was just plain bad. It tasted like some cheap premade crust you buy at safeway or something. I also tried a burger from there not too long ago which I would give a 3/10....All in all I don't think I'll be ordering from this place again, I've given it 3 chances and they gotten 3 strikes...in my book that means you're done.",

What arrived was thin crust that tasted like extra dry and crispy cardboard. I called them the next day to tell them it was overcooked and dry and didnt get as much as an apology. I decided to give them another try a couple of nights ago. Tried a veggie pizza, again asked for pan crust. The pizza did have thick crust this time, but it tasted like pillsbury pizza crust out of the tube, like you buy in the grocery store refrigerated section.. The toppings were good, but the crust ruined it. I also ordered a side salad with herb vinaigrette dressing, but got bleu cheese dressing... For a 12 inch pizza, 6 wings and a side salad, i spent over 25$ and was sorely disappointed.. No more Rosati's for me. I will stick with Frank's Pizza.....",

I use to be able to buy a 14 inch cheese and sausage for 14.99 and now within 2 years they have raised the pricing 3 times , making this same pizza 20.00.

I have been places where they advertise that if you come to the event, there will be \"free pizza\", and then you get there and it's Rosati's hot garbage or what they like to call pizza.  Then you immediately realize you were conned into going to this event and you should have just bought pizza instead of getting stuck with Rosati's pizza. So I ordered it myself, thinking \"maybe they just make garbage when companies order a bunch of pizzas, because they have to make a ton of them for cheaper.\" False. Rosati's doesn't discriminate, the pizza is still garbage regardless of who orders it. Side note: I ordered other food off of their menu, and it was also gross.  In summary you are better off ordering Italian food from literally anywhere else on Earth.   P.S.  I had to give them one star, in order to write a review. I would have preferred to give them ZERO stars.",

    "text": "I'd like to think that I caught this restaurant on a bad night.  I live around the corner from this Rosati's location and have been looking forward to trying their pizza.    On January 18th we ordered a large thin crust pizza but what was delivered had all the wrong toppings and a \"crust\" that can only be compared to a cardboard box.  We called to complain but the woman who answered the phone apparently couldn't hear us and hung up.  We drove with the nearly untouched pizza to the restaurant to exchange it for something else.  When we arrived we were greeted by a manager who was less than sympathetic.  We were expecting an apology but instead he questioned whether we ordered the pizza from the Rosati's website or Grub Hub.  We showed him that half of the pizza we ordered had none of the toppings we ordered and described the unpleasant crust. He agreed to make us a \"double dough\" pizza which he described as a \"regular pizza\" and refund the complete cost of our order.  The \"double dough\" crust was a thicker version of the thin crust; tasteless, overcooked and stale.  The toppings were correct but there just weren't enough of them.  The pizza looked more like a homemade pizza than one made by a restaurant that's been specializing in Chicago style pizza since 1964.  What's worse, it's been over two weeks and we have yet to receive the refund.   I was also turned off by the employee area being in full view of both the dine in and carry out areas.  Several employees were enjoying food, drinks and taking their break in full view of the paying customers.  I have no objection to these activities but I think it should be hidden from paying customers.  I would not recommend Rosati's to anyone and I won't be back myself, there are several better options around town.",

    "text": "we ordered pizza from rosati but we're staying at the SpringHill Suites Marriott on Van Buren .  After the first hour wait we called to see why we had not received a pizza . The lady on the phone told us our pizza would be ready in about a half hour they had been swamped. An hour later still no pizza. We called again since it has been 2 hours now. At that time we were informed that if pizza had not been made and that they were crediting back our money. The credit was received however we had no pizza at 830 at night. A phone call earlier would have been nice. I guess we'll never find out if you have good pizza. ..... Don't order here you'll starve waiting.  No stars deserved for ratings",

I love their Chicago deep dish and thin crust, though I think I prefer their thin crust. Their thin crust reminds me of one of my long-time favourite pizza places in Chicago. The people who work here have been nothing but awesome the two times I've been here.",

We are ordering for a dental office so we do not have the luxury of sending it back and waiting for them to get our order correct the second time. First, no one really cared but about an hour later we got a call from the manager giving us a credit to our account.  When we went to use the credit, it was nowhere to be found of course.  We order one last time because the food is pretty good. Again, the charming service messed up the order. They charge extra for french fries, no big deal so we all paid extra and NO ONE got fries. When I called back to ask why we were charged for something and not given it--they did not care and then preceeded to HANG UP ON ME.  People make mistakes but come on, every time we order?! Nothing bugs me more than wasting my money by overpaying for NOTHING. Especially getting hung up on because the people running the joint could not care less about anyone but themselves. I WILL NEVER COME TO THIS LOCATION AGAIN AND I WILL MAKE SURE EVERYONE KNOWS THE EMPLOYEES ARE ABSOLUTELY NO GOOD. I would be fired at my own job for the way these people treat their customers.",

    "text": "Great Chicago style pizza.  They are odd with their systems.  Yes, explanation coming.  I ordered using a groupon and did it through the website as I thought it would be easiest.  Of course after ordering using the Groupon, the instructions said to call the order in.  Go figure.  I arrived and at first they were not going to take the Groupon because I did not call the order in.  I was told it was something to do with their systems.  Pretty funny and ridiculous, I was about to tell them if that was needed, to cancel the web order, and I could stand there and call in same on the phone so it wouldn't be an issue with the Groupon.  Some of these businesses are so funny how they sound when they say this drivel.  I stood my ground and said that if they would not honor the groupon to cancel the order.  DOH.  They worked their magic, made me pay the sales tax and I was on my way.  I got home and the pizza was True Chicago style, real tomatoes none of that pressed stuff, and the ingredients were fresh, the peppers had that tiny bit of crunch you crave along with the homemade sausge.  I think i got the fantastic four or something...sausge, peppers, onions, whatever.  It was very good.  For takeout, dominoes step to the side, that is if I'm not too lazy to get in the car to pick it up.",

I called in my order, 1 12inch chicken Alfredo Pizza I am at home with my girlfriend watching movies and realized that it was 40 minutes since I had placed my order. I called in and spoke with the very nice lady at to go (not sarcasm). She said maybe 20 more minutes until it would arive. So finally and hour and a half of waiting happened until it finally showed up. It was 16$ in total and I handed the delivery lady a 20$. All she did was take the money and hand me a pizza. I greeted her and I got back a meh. Then I said have a good night and I didn't get eye contact or a response. That made me very angry as I work and manage a restaurant and was disgusted by how I was treated. I opened the pizza which was room temperature at best and more as me and my girlfriend started eating it it was just what seemed to be a block of cheese and bread. Soggy, stale crust, bad service, etc. I DO NOT recommend the Rosatis on 40th st. And Thomas. Absurd!",

    "text": "You know those places that refer to themselves as Chicago or New York \"favorites\", but people from those cities have never actually heard of them?  Well , being a Chicago native, I can tell you that Rosati's was not necessarily one of my \"favorites\", but it IS a place at which real Chicagoans eat, and it's pretty good!  Not great, and frankly not even as good as the Rosati's in Chicago, but it's still a cheap and easy way to beam yourself out to the midwest for an hour or so.  Stick with the thin crust pizza. Although Chicago is mostly known for it's deep dish, thin crust pizza cut in squares like ths one is actually what most Chicagoans eat on an every day basis.  When people argue about \"Chicago pizza\" vs. \"New York pizza\" I always think they should use the thin crust pizza rather than the eep dish. It's much more easily comparable.   Don't get me wrong, Chicago deep dish pizza is one of the country's greatest delicacies, but it's moe than just pizza, and for that reason it really can't be considered in the same conversation ith other pizza from around the country, or even around the world.   Why did I just go off on that tangent? No idea...has very little to do with Rosati's.",

    "text": "May 2014 - I've been eating Rosati's for years now, and I'm a huge fan. I realize now that I was spoiled by this location. I also realize I've been giving away 5 star reviews more liberally the last few years and back when I reviewed this as a 4, I was a lot tougher of a critic on places. Since I wrote the original review below, I have been to Chicago and have eaten at all of the famous deep dish places, and this Rosati's beats em. I'm not kidding.   Now the owner of this location has been here for years now, and he has done a fantastic job of staying consistent and awesome. I heard that new franchise owners go here to train. Not all Rosati's are created equal. Some are not up to par, but this location is the gold standard as far as I'm concerned.   Even though I moved out of range for this location, the one near my house was not that great - so when I got the craving, I would go miles out of my way to get pizza here. Perfect every single time. I've now moved again and am even further away - the Rosati's near my house is from the Corporate side, and is also really solid so I may not go as far out of my way as often anymore, but I still will occasionally.   Think of it this way - Rosati's prices aren't cheap, and most locations don't really have a sit-down experience that the food really deserves. This means to me that the ingredients quality is high. At locations where they stick with the program, it definitely is. This is one of them. Again - in my opinion, this is the gold standard for this franchise.   I'm upping it to 5 stars - and these are well deserved. I'm only sorry that I let this location sit at 4 stars for so long.   3/22/2009 - Rosati's is under new ownership. Apparently, it was going downhill fast under the previous owner near the end. Now it seems to have been rescued and revamped.   I haven't been inside, but I did order some delivery yesterday. I got a 12\" Chicago style pizza... it was pretty damn good. It was a little spendy, but I'd say it was worth it. It fed me for two days. The pizza arrived hot, and the box it came in was actually pretty fancy for a pizza box.   Their menu is pretty nice. I spoke with the owner when I called to order and he told me about what he's been doing. He's definitely trying to raise the bar and elevate this place to another level. I think he said he bought a few other spots as well.   Since it's a little more pricey than Mama Mia's, I don't know how often I'll order from here, but it's a nice alternative. If you're a fan of Chicago pizza - this seems to be a solid place to get it.  I'll update this review after I've eaten here a few more times.  Edit: Okay, after eating here a few times, I'll say that I love their toppings, but the bread they use sucks. The pasta isn't terribly amazing either. It's good though. The delivery is fast and it arrives really hot and fresh. I'm still keeping it at 4 stars.",

    "text": "I have to update this review *again*.  A few weeks back I had the privilege of enjoying a Fabulous Four pizza using a promotion where I had to pay for an extra topping but otherwise most of the pizza was paid for by the promotion. That was a phenomenal experience, one I wanted to repeat. I'd have to pay for three toppings this time, not just one, but that's totally worth it. Instead, I just had a terrible experience, this was at 8:30p on Monday, May 27. I again got a free pizza deal from my online promotions, which I would truly be grateful for, but for experiences like tonight. I drive there to order in person so there would be no misunderstandings on my order. This woman comes forward to the counter and asks \"can I place your order?\" I say \"I'd like to redeem this\" and hand her a detailed printout of my offer. I then ask, \"Also, I was wondering how much it would cost to add extra toppings to this free piz-..\" \"Two dollars each,\" she said, interrupting me, \"two dollars each, it's two dollars per topping, but you have to order a pizza first, are you going to place an order for a pizza or not?\" I said, \"Fabulous Four. I'd like a Fabulous Four pizza using this offer, please.\" She says, \"okay, can I have your phone number? I won't use that.\" (Pointing to my print-out.) I gave her my number. She got it wrong. I gave it again. She got it wrong again. The phone rings, she puts them on hold (I guess). She asks for my phone number again. I pick up and hold up the print-out. \"My number is on here. Please use this print-out. It's right there.\" I point at my phone number. So she puts in my phone number. \"Okay, you wanted a ... classic combo?\" \"Fabulous Four,\" I repeated. Staring at her computer screen, \"Oh, it says you have to order something else first. You get a free pizza when you order another pizza.\" I said, \"No, that's the other offer. I got two offers this week. One was buy one get one free. I printed this one out because it was just a free pizza.\" \"Oh, okay.\" She keeps clicking at her computer. I took the print-out and said, \"Please use this print-out for the rules, it says what rules apply, what the conditions are .. which are nothing. It just says, free pizza.\" \"Okay,\" she says still looking at her computer, thank goodness she found it, \"it says a ONE. TOPPING. pizza. Just one topping.\" \"Yes,\" I said, \"that's why I was asking about paying for adding extra toppings, you know what, I'll just do this later.\" I took my print-out and left. I had completely lost my appetite. You know, I know I come across like an entitled little b-. But I'm still your customer, and I get these offers because I've been paying for food in recent past. I print these coupons out because I'm instructed to, and the print-outs have everything needed to fulfill my order. This isn't rocket science, and by the way why on earth are you arguing with me? The last time I used a promotion offer the person taking my order was a delightful person who didn't try to do everything they could to undermine my order.  EDIT: Okay, waited till the weekend, Saturday at noon to retry my order. I was able to successfully place my order with, again, a delightful and competent young woman who gave me no hassle, never made me repeat myself, and was agreeable till I walked out with my pizza. (Fantastic Four is still so good.)",

Rosati's is a great tasting Chicago thin crust pizza and probably excellent pastas however, Chicago prices just don't fly in my neighborhood or my middle class pocket book. A small pizza should be a modest luxury not a quarter day's pay. Phoenix is a Midwestern City, always has been. Real natives of Phoenix that withstood the crippling heat before HVAC have been enjoying great moderately priced mom and pop Chicago Pizza since the 1950s. Not the 1990s.  Value is still out there, speak up, please don't let Arcadia gentrify pizza prices! The difference between the many Rosati's locations and the original Gino's on South Central Avenue is simply down-home value. For taste and convenience, I don't think there is a better tasting chain restaurant than Rosati's but be prepared to pay their Windy City Prices.",

    "text": "There's a strip mall at around Thomas and 40th in Phoenix, not quite all the way out to Scottsdale, that has a lot of different ethnic food choices.  I was destined for Rosati's Pizza.  They make pasta, too.    There are several Rosati's in the valley - the Valley of the Sun, that is.  Rosati's also won out because of name recognition ... not as it refers to other Rosati's stores in the valley, but because it was a successful Italian grocery store and restaurant on Pico Blvd. on L.A.'s West Side when I was growing up.  Rosati's is mostly a to go pizzeria, it seems, and also has a restaurant just a turn from the counter.  The restaurant wasn't all that pleasant with the dim(mer) lighting and dank looking tan/yellow \"Tuscan\" walls.  I tend not to get pizza when you can't get slices so I opted for a plate of pasta.  The pasta was penne and I got it with the tomato cream sauce, sometimes known as pink sauce in the States or rose' sauce to some Canadian Anglophones.    The pasta was okay.  This prevalence of tomato cream sauce being offered in Phoenix seems to be a \"thing.\"  In a few days, I ran into it quite a bit.  The girl who took my order was nice but asked me if I wanted grated cheese on it.  I said yes.  She finally came around when I was almost done eating and said, 'I'm sorry, I forgot.  Do you still want some?'  Sure, why not?  At any rate, there was a large Hispanic group of about ten or so across from me ordering up some pastas and at least three pizzas.  I think they stole my thunder, so I was sort of forgotten.  Speaking of this group, the pizzas they ordered looked good.  Their crusts were thick at the outer perimeter and they seemed pretty chock full of ingredients.  Rosati's is supposed to offer Chicago style pizza and, even though I lived in the state of Illinois for three years, I never did learn what that implied, nor if stuffed pizza is a Chicago thing.  At any rate, with all the Chicagoland kids going to ASU and U of A, playing up the Chicago connection in Phoenix is akin to knowing what side your bread is buttered on.  The authenticity of how Italian an establishment is seems to dwindle with time.  I got one of their paper menus and cringed at something I saw.  One of their catering type options was named \"Fiesta di Italia.\"  There is no such word as \"fiesta\" in Italian.  You can either address a sizable demographic in the valley and name it \"Fiesta de Italia\" ... or you can spell it correctly and name it \"Festa d'Italia.\"      That said, my meal, the 'oops, I forgot' service situation while there, and gaffes like this on the menu make Rosati's sort of pedestrian as far as Italian food and pizza go.  It was okay and satisfying.  It just didn't stand out among any Italian restaurants or pizzerias I've been to in my life, but they will fill your hatch for you.",

I once ordered from the catering package from here for a 6:00pm meeting   and was disappointed that the food was cold.  The cannolis were frozen.  My guests who happen to be tired physicians, didn't care for the food.  There was a lot of leftover pasta for the next day and of course once heated up in the microwave, it tasted better.  But who wants cold pasta at 6:00pm at night after a long day?  I did call to complain about my expensive catering order and did get an apology and some discount coupons for a next order.  But, I don't think my supervisor will allow me to order their catering packages any more.  I'll stick to the pizza delivery (which one time was 15 minutes late when I asked for 5:30pm delivery and pizza arrived at 5:45pm) But, the pizza is very tasty!!!",

We went in on Christmas Eve as it was one of the few places open and placed and order.  I said on at least FIVE separate occasions wait in the pizza I wanted pie slice.  Right up to the point the pizza was coming out of oven. End result was square cut.  The have me a credit for replacement pizza.   I went in tonight for that pizza.  Again, told them pie cut.  Got to store.  Said here for pickup.  The confirmed my order and desire for pie cut.  Pizza took longer than indicated time.  Pizza cutter guy who clearly spoke great English asked pie if I was the one that wanted pie cut. I said yes. He asked 4 slices per half?  I said I don't care just slices NOT squares.  He said got ya.  Manager brings pizza to counter and regrets to inform me it was squares and think saying our cutters are so used to squares they made a mistake.  To that I say bulls**t.  I till spread on social media and to all friends never to go here if you want an accurate order.    It may seem small in the grand scheme of things but is the lack of attention to details that is gross negligence.  Also, the dough was very overworked and made it tough and dry.  Quality of product is substandard these days and no attention to customer instructions.   Rather give a zero or even a negative star.",

Everything tasted a little generic, really average, the portion size is deceptively small. I chose this groupon due to proximity to my job and I chose Pasta cause Im sick of Pizza & Sandwiches. A week later I ordered another Spaghetti & Meatball for pick up, this time I added meat sauce and mushrooms, hoping that would punch the flavor up a bit. This time when I got to Rosati's, I had the pleasure of being attended to by a not so pleasant women behind the counter who informed me that there owner told her that the Groupons were only valid for Pizza, after the previous week before I ordered Spaghetti & Meatball with my Groupon. I was certain that the Groupon add never specified anywhere \"only pizza\", No need to argue, I'll take it up with Groupon, scratched the order and walked out. I went back to the add on Groupon later and all it says is 2 15.00 Groupons for Italian Cuisine, not \"only pizza\". Now I have to waste my time writing this poor review and calling Groupon, so anoying. Pass on this place, for there poor misleading Groupon intentionality or not. Too top things off they lost the value of the Spaghetti & Meatballs, cause I had to walk out before I got mad, at the least they could have done Is given me what was already made, apologized for the inconvenience, but they dident have the for site to give good customer service and except the responsibility for there misleading Groupon. \"Thumbs Way Down\", for this experience.",

I had stopped going to Rosati's several years ago after repeated bad service, rude un - knowledgeable employee's, and lifeless products! Also I had inquired with the previous owner about doing a 400.00 catering order that I needed delivered by 11:15am. He told me they do not open until 11am so he wouldn't be able to do it! UGH what a stugots!   Anyway on to the new. I received a fax that the ownership had changed and I thought what the heck, I will give it a shot. Some co-workers decided they wanted in. GO figure isn't that always how it is.   I ordered the baked Mostaccioli lunch special it comes with a can of whatever Coke product you like. I added two meatballs. Plus a garlic bread stick. Total 7.50! Not bad at all I thought. Well it was a bargain and a half the dish is HUGE! It comes in a 9inch Togo pan! I shared with a co worker and still have tomorrow's lunch covered as well! The meatballs are very very good and I am damn picky about my meatball's. Just the right amount of marinara, noodles al dente, and covered in melted mozzarella! They got this dish right.   My coworkers got the meatball sandwich's, that sucker is huge too! Smothered in melted mozzarella with fries and a coke 5.70!   It was delish! I will be back. To try many other items, I will keep you posted. Almost forgot they have Eli's Cheesecake!!!!!! Note there is no dining in it is all carry out or delivery.   4 stars for the food quality, the 5th star is for the portion to price!  The menu is huge so check them out on-line. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.rosatisonthomas.com&s=3d38daf9c9307835c247469d260ea74758a99b0e340451ce2a31468c2a102e76\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">rosatisonthomas.com</a>",

The place was pretty quite for a Tuesday afternoon when I went, seemed like only the employees were  there.  Not sure if I would go again, a little too pricy for pizza. Just wanted to try the pizza place.",

    "text": "Add me to the list of people with MAJOR issues on the delivery accuracy and customer service on this place.  People in my office used to order from here all the time. At least 4 or 5 times each week - sometimes several deliveries in one day. And we considered it one of the best delivery options we had. Then orders started getting messed up. More often then they were right. More people here refuse to order from Rosati's than are welcome to take the risk - knowing it's more than likely they won't get what they ordered or how they ordered it. About six months ago, I ordered for three of us - and there were several issues. When I called, a woman claiming to be the manager offered me a $10.00 credit. When I called for the next delivery and tried to get the credit, there was no record of it. My last straw was last Monday. I thought I was brilliant by ordering online - where I could specify anything specific and it was all in clear print - no chance to mess up, right?  HA! I ordered a an Italian beef sandwich with peppers, onions and light mozzarella; a small Greek salad and a brownie for me. Also got cheese sticks with marinara for one coworker and the \"duo\" (shown on the menu as fried mushrooms and zucchini) with ranch for another. Delivery came in one hour, 15 minutes. Everything was lukewarm, including the salad. The cheese sticks were barely edible. The duo came with cauliflower instead of zucchini (would not have been ordered at all if cauliflower had been advertised) and the ranch was missing. The mushrooms were referred to as glue by the coworker who ate one, and threw away the rest. My sandwich was OK. Not great, but OK. And the salad was fine - after I put it in the fridge for a few hours. I'd love to tell you about the brownie - but it wasn't with the order. I called and spoke with a gal who claimed to be the manager. She offered me a credit, or she could send a driver back with the ranch, some zucchini and my brownie. No luck with the last credit I was offered - and I really didn't want to wait another hour for ranch (no longer needed, as the food it was requested for was thrown away) and my brownie. I asked those items be refunded to my credit card. I was told the owners would call me the next day. That was over a week ago. Rosati's on Thomas - I am sad to say you have worked your way onto my DO NOT CALL list. My coworkers were right. I was wrong. Enjoy my money - you won't be seeing any more of it. And I can't think of anyone from my office who disagrees at this point.",

    "text": "It's really sad that the food is so good here, but the quality of service is so terrible. On more than one occasion, I've had items missing from my order and been forced to return to the store to retrieve the missing items. The most memorable one went like this:  1. Order lunch for my office from Rosati's.  2. Drive to pick up the order.  Ask if both sandwiches are in the bag. Receive confirmation that the entire order is there. 3. Foolishly believe them, choosing not to open the stapled bag. 4. Return to the office and discover that the Italian sub is, in fact, missing from the order. 5. Drive back to pick up the wayward sandwich. 6. Return to the office (again) and discover that the \"Italian\" sub is a roll with lettuce, tomato, and dressing. 7. Drive back (third time!) to Rosati's to have them actually make an Italian sub, while the rest of the food gets all cold and gross. 8. Receive exactly: one (1) half assed apology; zero (0) offers to refund the sandwich that screwed up my lunch hour; zero (0) offers to remake the other food that is slowly congealing while waiting for the SIMPLEST item in the whole order; and one (1) confused look when I asked if I could at least have a free drink or something for my trouble. 9. Be ignored by management while trying to correct the situation in the following days. 10. Never, ever go back. I don't care how good your garlic calzones are Rosati's! It's not worth it!  **I think these are franchised, so it might only be this location that is so, so very sad. They might also not be a terrible choice if you are only getting one thing and eating it there - you know, so you can supervise their idiocy and correct it promptly.",

I figured the discounted price would make up for any bad service or what have you but I found as many of the more recent reviewers have noted that this place is under new ownership and is completely separate from the other Rosati's now. They do seem to have a few bugs to work out but all of the staff was very friendly and the Pizza was great. The manager on duty (young bald guy) was really cool. The place is geared mostly to take out and delivery but they have a few tables and even brought out the order to us. I would definitely recommend this place and will go back again and would like to try some of their pastas.",

We had to take our food to go it was so nauseating.  Food we took home was excellent.   NOW... we decided to give it another chance. .. food is that good.  Went back, and the smell is fixed.  I ordered a meatball sub... my partner ordered a small pizza... a SMALL, THIN CRUST... you know the cracker kind... well I got my sandwich in about 10 minutes.  My partner... they forgot to make her pizza and didn't realize it until they brought my sandwhich.  So I knew her pizza was going to be delayed 10 minutes.  I was wrong... after 25 minutes... THIN CRUST FOLKS... they said it would be 2 more minutes.   Long story short... after asking what they were going to fo to compensate us for the lack of bringing the food together and in a timely fashion, I was given a coupon from the Sunday insert.  It doesn't take 25 minutes for a thin crust... they forgot her order and when we asked for some sort of compensation got essentially nothing... except this free advise from the guy at the counter... \"make sure you say you want the food to show up together.\"  Apparently when 2 people go to sit down to eat together... that's not automatically presumed that they want to eat together.   I am so mad about what happened and the details of my conversations with the 3 stooges behind the counter over this meal last night (all the details I left out)  that I doubt I will be back regardless of the food.  They are not the only game in town on pizza and subs.  No customer service skills whatsoever and no vested interest about customer satisfaction.",

I was ready to be angry and expected the food to be wrong and cold, but it was perfect.  The plates were enough to feed four people.       We decided to try them again and this time we got their hamburger and Italian Beef sandwich.  It took an hour to get here, but again the food was hot and really good.  I was happy that they put the au jus  for my sandwich on the side and that they gave me enough. I think we will use them on a regular basis, but now know that we need to order the food a little early.  It really is worth the wait though.       After a third time of ordering from them, I have to say they are awesome.  I absolutely love their Italian beef sandwich.  I appreciate the fact that they don't charge extra to get sweet peppers and giardiniera.",

Disappointing but I guess the new owners didn't think it was economical. Last 3 orders were delivered with incorrect ingredients/toppings but I tried to give them one more try tonight. The order taker couldn't figure out what I meant when I ordered a dry beef with au jus on the side. After 3 or 4 mins of miscommunication I knew the order would be messed up again. I decided to abort the  mission and delete them from my delivery contact list. Too bad.....  really miss the ribs......",

    "text": "Glad to find Rosati's open and ready to serve on a busy Superbowl Sunday, for sure, and they even turned up on the sound for me as the game started and still waiting for my order! Service was great, and the staff who took my order and brought it to me were very friendly, unfortunately...  The pizza kinda sucks!  I realize the staff aren't responsible for the pizza recipe, or where they get their sauces and how they designed the pies, but it's not so great. Of course, they probably don't know LouEddies in Skyforest, CA, and perhaps I've become a pizza snob.  I decided to go with the half-half, since I'm not a big fan of a lot of dough, but geez, THAT WAS ALOT OF DOUGH! I wonder what the Deep Dish is like? Ordered the Hawaiian and the ingredients were buried someone under the browned cheese layer that slid off as I took a bite into the thick, chewy crust...not what I was expecting, or appreciated. The sauce tasted canned.  Now, if the dough was anything special, I wouldn't mind the extra bread, but it was just that...dough. Also, ordered a 20oz and got a full liter, which was too much coke and the place was too busy to really fight over $1.50 and get a smaller bottle, so off I went....now that I think about it, I probably got the Double Dough Pizza and this would explain the dough dough pizza I received, since my simple coke order was mis-rung.  Oh well, either no good pizza, or screwed up my order, Rosati's gets three generous stars.",

    "text": "I decided to try Rosati's because other than Dominos, Papa John's, etc., they were the only pizza place that would deliver to my hotel.  The pros: -The customer service was great. I called to place my order and the price came out more expensive than what their website had listed. The girl who answered the phone gave me 10% off and it made the pizza even cheaper than what was listed on the website! -The size:  This pizza was HUGE. I got a large (16\") with the double crust and this put a Dominos large to shame.  -Speaking of the crust, the double crust was delicious. Great texture, not too thick but still thicker than a standard pizza crust and had a subtle taste that wasn't overwhelmingly salty or over seasoned. It reminded me of a baked bread loaf you'd get at a nice restaurant.  -The delivery driver was polite and punctual. Not only that, when the pizza was delivered it was still too hot to eat!  The cons: -The only way to order from their website is to create an account. Not a huge deal since I was able to call in but much less convenient.  -I ordered a pizza with Mozzarella, Sausage, Pepperoni, Tomato, Onion, and Fresh Garlic. Unfortunately, the pizza I got was missing pepperoni.  Short of getting my order slightly wrong, this place is definitely worth checking out for yourself. I generally try to avoid the chain pizza joints and look for those hidden gems in the different cities I travel to. I think I found one in Rosati's.",

But that's not my favorite part.  The team taking orders over the phone is capable, kind and actually enjoyable to work with. Every time I call I think, \"Where do they find these awesome people?!\" That USED to be my favorite part...  But tonight... the delivery guy trumped all.  While waiting for the pizza to arrive, I suddenly remembered that the duct tape I had plastered all over my doorbell to prevent unsuspecting delivery people from ringing it lest they wake my sleeping children and face the wrath of a woman who now has to deal with two awakened toddlers - (breath) - had finally fallen off and I hadn't yet replaced it.  \"Oh shoot!\" I said to my husband. \"I forgot to re-cover the doorbell! The pizza guy is going to ring it and wake the kids!\"  Just then, there was a knock at the door. Whew. A knock. NOT a doorbell. \"That was lucky.\" I thought.  And that's when I heard the delivery guy say something to my husband as he handed over the pizza.  \"Hey, uh, I thought I remembered there was a sign or something not to ring the doorbell last time I was here (at least a month earlier) ... so I thought I would just knock instead.\"  Delivery guy? Or angel. You decide.",

The food quality wasn't very good. I ordered Mango Habanero sauce for my chicken wings order, and it tasted no where near a spicy mango flavor. The taste was sweet and spicy BBQ sauce. I don't care for the BBQ flavor, so it was disappointing to smell and taste the sauce. I also ordered what it said as pistachios cannolis. Surprisingly it was no where near pistachios. It was frozen solid, with green coloring on both ends of the cannoli. No pistachios or nuts of any kind in the cannoli, except for the green food coloring and some chocolate chips . I opened the frozen cannoli and the filling tasted chalky. I am not sure of the ingredients. In the end, the only good thing that was edible was the side salad that I ordered. Despite my order was simple that consisted of 6 wings, 2 cannoli and a side salad, it came up to $19 and change!!!!!??? I wouldn't recommend it to any visitors to the area. The prices didn't match the quality.",
