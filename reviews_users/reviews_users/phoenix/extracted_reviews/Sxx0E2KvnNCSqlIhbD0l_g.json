    "text": "This review is going to kill me, because I want so badly to give them 4-5 stars but just can't...  I have been coming to US Egg since it first opened. Their protein pancakes had me at hello and have been a staple of mine nearly every weekend, whether it be with my wife, my friends, or my parents. I lived in Los Angeles for nearly 5 years, and every time I came back to AZ I hit up US Egg. It seemed like every time I went I received a delicious, piping hot breakfast from an attractive, attentive, happy wait staff. I thought they would be my go-to breakfast place for life...  However, a few years ago they started to branch out, and just like many mom and pop places that try to spread their wings, they fly too close to the sun and their consistency suffers greatly. Over the last 2-3 years, EVERY time I bring someone here, raving about the food and the service...there's a problem. Sausage has been undercooked, eggs were cold, even my beloved pancakes (No! Not my protein pancakes!!!!!) have had zero blueberries in them, have been cold, or have been burned beyond recognition. My parents have had so many bad experiences with their unusually inattentive wait staff that they refuse to go with me now that I have moved back to Scottsdale. It seems like the place is always in a rush and too busy for their own good.  About the only consistent thing about this location is its inconsistency. I have eaten there 3 times in the last month I have been back, and each time has been different. I took my brother in law after a long, early morning hike on a Saturday and the place was just like I remembered...great, friendly wait staff with wonderful, hot breakfasts. We both had the eggs combo with protein pancake upgrade and it was delicious; thick, crispy bacon, piping hot eggs cooked to order, deliciously hot and fluffy pancakes with almond slivers, blueberries, and granola. The other two times...not so much. Both times food was undercooked or cold, and when we requested new food, they nuked it and passed it off as new food!!!!! REALLY?! If there is a bite out of it sweetie, we can tell it's the same sausage patty! It is really disappointing, because this place used to be a bastion of consistency and quality that made it a staple of Old Town breakfast places. I give it 3 stars because there are glimmers of great quality here and there. I just hope that they can find the consistency that once made them one of the best places in town for breakfast.",

I also ordered a side of sourdough toast and never received it. I ordered the eggs benedict, like always, and I wasn't disappointed. My friend ordered a blueberry muffin that was by far one of the best muffins I've ever had. My other friend wanted to substitute something for eggs in her meal and the waitress refused to work with her and basically just told her she couldn't. The least she could have done was ask a manager first. I'd eat here again just because the food was good, but I'd hope the service was better next time.",

The care and concern everyone put forth will be treasured. We were so pleased with everything that we returned to the US Egg on Wednesday for breakfast (Tempe Location). No matter what location you are at, you will have a great meal, service and experience. I highly recommend US Egg. You can't go wrong with the protein cakes, skillets, and more.

    "text": "We have been going to this US Egg location for about 6 years and usually it's the best.  However, today we had one of the worst dining experiences imaginable.  The worst thing about it was the way the management chose to handle it.  Here's a snapshot: --Party of 4:  2 adults + 2 toddlers.  We were shown to our table immediately. --About 15-20 minutes went by without anyone stopping at our table to even address us. --Finally our order was taken - we ordered two kids breakfasts and two standard items off the menu. --35 minutes later our food had still not arrived.  During that time, our server never once stopped by, checked to see if we needed refills, or indicated anything unusual about our order. --My wife walked up to the host stand to check on the status that was followed by no updates. --Still nobody came over to our table until finally our food arrived - 40 minutes after we ordered it (and a full hour after we sat down at the table with two toddlers). --One of our kid's meals was missing - the server never even placed the order to begin with. --Server started making excuses about how busy they were.  However, we regularly go to this locations on Sunday mornings and they are typically far busier - even with a wait to get a table - and we never have to wait that long for our food. --We explained that we come often and that it never takes this long - and she then challenged us by snootily asking \"do you ever come on Sundays?\"  To which we responded yes - all the time.  Then she became even more argumentative and said \"Well, have you come during Spring Training?\"  Of course we have.  And we've been there when it's far busier than it was today and it's never taken this long. --Finally, after arguing with us, we just demanded that she go and get our son's meal since it was clearly missing (and you can only imagine how much fun it is to be with a toddler who's been waiting an hour for food only to see that the rest of his family has something to eat but he still has to wait). --Even before our son's food arrived, my wife cut into her pancake only to find a nasty, slimy brown hair on her plate underneath it. --The food runner finally brought our son's food and at that point we pointed out the hair on the other plate.  She took it away and said she'd bring back a fresh one. --At no point did our server ever come back to apologize for the hair in the food, for forgetting one of our four orders, or for taking so long for the order. --Furthermore, our drinks were never even refilled the entire hour+ we were at our table. --In the end, they took both kids meals off the bill which surprised us that they didn't offer more consideration for the hairy pancakes.  At that point we were very frustrated and in disbelief about the whole thing.  When she told us about taking off the kids meals, I commented that I was surprised they still wanted to charge us for anything given the hair and the wait.  She rudely snapped \"If you are eating it, you are paying for it.\"  We finally left, made a comment to the manager at the front that it was a terrible experience, and he just shrugged and said \"I heard about it.\"  Clearly he didn't care.  Honestly, if they had just provided the slightest bit of remorse or expressed even a hint of an apology it would have been different.  However, instead the server and management were aloof and certainly didn't prioritize customer service over their desire to charge us.  Of course, we paid our bill as always.  However, if they had simply apologized and taken off my wife's hairy pancakes I would not have felt compelled to post this Yelp review.",

You won't have much of a wait if you come during the week at lunchtime, but expect a long wait time if you want to eat at peak breakfast or brunch hours on weekends. Always friendly service and good food. Love how they leave a big carafe of ice water on your table so you never have to wait for a server to refill your glass.

They get it, which is why they are head and shoulders above any other breakfast and lunch eatery in all of Scottsdale.",

She offered to replace it, but I don't want more cold food.  4) When we left the manager who was told about our cold food was the one who checked us out, never asked how it was since he didn't want to hear about the complaint...can you say \"CHICKEN SHIT?\"  Save your self some money and headaches and just go to Denny's get twice as much food for half the $$...",

I got strawberry pancakes with eggs and bacon with orange juice. The strawberries were delicious, and they topped the pancakes with lots of whipped cream. Amazing. They also have protein pancakes.  My boyfriend did mention that the coffee wasn't great, but compared to a similar breakfast restaurant (ahem, The Good Egg), it wasn't good there, either. So he didn't hold it against them. He had blueberry pancakes with eggs and bacon and he loved it. Even so far as to say that the food was better, albeit more expensive at U.S. Egg.  Also, for a Saturday morning/early afternoon, we were seated right away and our food came out super quickly. All around great service as well.  I will always come back, but not as often as I'd like because our bill was $24. Ouch! Only giving it 4/5 stars because it's more expensive than the competitors. If I could, I'd give it 4.5! :)",

We ordered our food and it came out in about 2 minutes, eggs over medium with ham and I got the breakfast burrito.  Great, but it made us wonder if it was pre-made, sitting under a heat lamp.  Then we got the answer.  My wife's eggs over medium were over cooked.  One egg yolk was solid, no run.  We asked for the eggs to be made again.  Once again the eggs came out in less then 2 minutes and they were the same, over cooked.  My wife asked for them to be taken away.  The bill came and there was no discount for the poorly cooked eggs.  When I noted this to the waitress, she said she thought the Manager had taken it off.  The Manager then came over and said she would take $2.50 off for the eggs my wife didn't like.  The waitress was then very surly and was tipped accordingly.   I think they pre-make a lot of food to get ready for the rush.  We are never going to this US Egg again.",

If you go on weekend, expect a wait. They have a pretty quick turnover, so it's nothing painful. US Egg is filled with a mix of families and Scottsdale-ites decked out in oversized sunglasses and dresses and affliction t-shirts from the night before.   I wish I lived closer so I could visit more often and enjoy those famous protein pancakes. I was expecting healthy with an element of bland and chalky... completely wrong. They have a great grainy texture and a delicious cinnamon flavor.",

    "text": "The US Egg is my weekend breakfast stop. It's a rare weekend that I don't eat there at least once. My go-to breakfast would be a half order of protein pancakes (a full order is two pancakes and they're HUGE) with bananas and blueberries and a side order of scrambled eggs. I'm also a big fan of the breakfast burrito (without meat). It comes with eggs, potatoes, veggies, cheese and salsa. It's big enough to split into two meals, or to share with your friends. In fact, most of the meals at US Egg are large enough to share, and at a cost of $0.99 an egg, I like to add a side of scrambled eggs to make sure everyone leaves with a full belly!  One potential mis-step is that their menu appears to limit the available options. Most meals can be completely customized (sub meat for veggies, sub chicken for sausage, etc...). The possibilities are endless.  There's also a great patio which is perfect on a quiet Sunday morning when cars aren't speeding down Scottsdale Road yet.",

    "text": "Four of us went there for breakfast on Saturday morning.  The business was busy but not crazy and we were sat within 15 minutes.  The menu looked great but here comes the review.  We ordered two Idaho skillets, one omelette and a French dip.  Skillet 1 was acceptable if you don't mind that US Egg's version  of melted cheese, which means you have to search for it.  I did find some.  The 'hash browns' were shredded potatoes that most likely were microwaved then thrown on the grill for 30-60 seconds.  Hardly what is considered hashbrowns.   Over all it was OK but hardly anything to order again.  Skillet 2 came out with the wrong style eggs, OK, that can happen to anybody and was quickly remedied by the waitress.  It was passable with the same 'hashbrowns' and dry chicken.  Again, not something worth ordering again.  Omelette was an interesting omelette of which I can do far better at home on.   The entire leafs of spinach were essentially folded into what can best be described as scrambled eggs.   Could just be US Egg has their own version of omelettes also.  Same story on the 'hashbrowns.'  French dip came with au jus which is definitely required.  The roast beef was extremely dry and the bun likely a day old and dry also to where you needed the au just for both.  We didn't follow up with a manager as we were hungry and figured it was just a lesson learned.   We're located in the valley and are in this part of Scottsdale frequently  and now have been able to cross this breakfast establishment off our list.  FYI there is a Denny's across the street that might just do better.",

Another person had a run of the mill omelette and standard hash browns.

I love that they offer the Half and Half, which includes a small order of the protein pancakes and a half skillet. Perfect for satisfying the sweet and salty cravings. The coffee is decent, which is all I ask for in a no frills breakfast spot. There is a large parking lot at this location, although it can get a bit crowded at peak breakfast time.

I must admit when we pulled up I saw few people waiting outside and thought and told my husband that I didn't want to go in cause there looks like a line.  But he convinced me that we should just go in.    We walked in and the hostess told us it would be 5-10 minutes I surprised how fast they seated us.  There was soo much to choose from on the menu, but I am such a simple girl I just wanted to egg, bacon, and potatoes, and that's what I got! And the Decaf wasn't too bad either!  The real reason why I chose to eat here was because I read Gabi M's review who is the community manager of Scottsdale/PHX area.  The funniest thing is that just as we got our coffee a guy walked by and I noticed that it was Gabi's husband, then who should be walking behind him GABI!!! Loved that! always great to see you Gabi!!! Thanks for your review!  Great place!",

Hash Browns were luke warm at best, meat in skillet was sorta warm.  Over easy egg was medium.  Last rwo visits to you guys have been away from Tempe and very subpar.  I guess I will omly go to Tempe location and since its 35 miles from my house, not too often now.  Sad to have to write this but you guys need to step up the game.",

When we were seated, there was still a pitcher of water, from the previous party, along with some trash that sat there for a good 10 minutes, before someone cleaned it off.  Not long after the table was cleaned off, our waitress quickly got our drinks and food ordered. But, when the food was delivered, the main server directed the other server to put a plate of food in front of mom, but she gives it to my dad instead and just walked away, leaving our poor waitress to make the switch.  Food portions are huge, so well worth your bang for your buck. I loved my cornbeef and hash dish. Unfortunately, a few of the staff's customer service skills could use some improvement.",

The portions are large.  But the part I love about U.S. Egg is the consistently friendly service.  In fact, one morning a server insisted on buying one of her regulars breakfast.  I eaves-dropped on the entire conversation because 1.) I am nosy and 2.) I was fascinated.    I do love their turkey sausage here for some reason.  But the real reason I come to U.S. Egg is its location.  It is the best place to go when I am on my way OUT of Old Town.    U.S. Egg, I will be seeing you soon!",

However, if you go anytime before 11am, expect to wait a solid 15 minutes or so for a table.  They're busy, because they're popular, but they also staff the restaurant well, so the wait isn't as long as it could be if it weren't staffed as well.  The servers aren't overly friendly or conversational, but I think that goes back to the fact that they are so busy in the mornings.  I give them a pass because the food and prices are so legit.  Without fail, my wife and I always order the Protein Pancakes with a side of eggs.  We don't typically get into ruts like that, because we like to try new things, but you CAN'T beat these pancakes!  Try them.  You're welcome.",

Located just a few blocks from Scottsdale Stadium (Home of the two time San Francisco Giants.. ahem), this place is a must-go before an afternoon game.   Why is US Egg so special? Well, even though there is a wait, you get FREE coffee? There is a private parking lot so no need to stress about parking either.   The food is awesome. Try the half and half - two protein pancakes (delish pancakes with slivers of almonds, oatmeal, and blueberries - SUPER FOODS!), and a skillet of your choosing. Skillets can come with bacon, chorizo, peppers, onions, you name it. And they are topped with a fried egg. Yes, yes, a thousand times yes.   Service is excellent and fast. Water is in a pitcher on your table so you don't have to wait for refills. As is coffee.  What else do you need?",

The interior is clean and bright and cheerful, and the staff could not be more friendly or efficient.  Ashley waited on us and she was a peach!  We both had omelettes, which were fluffy and delicious, with tasty fillings.  I can always tell a good omelette when the cook takes the time to saute and soften the vegetables before filling the omelette.  The hash browns were wonderful and crispy without the slightest bit of grease, and, of course, the toast was great.    I almost forgot to mention, but the coffee was excellent.

Definitely not the worst tasting pancake but it just got way too built up in other reviews , thought I would set the record straight.  The skillet was amazing though so I would definitely recommend trying the chicken avocado bacon skillet and the pancake but not have this built up idea about how life changing those pancakes will be, overall great experience, will have to come back for the omelette   Also: love how they offered me coffee to go after I basically murdered that whole pot of coffee.",

Two sausage, 2 eggs (after I add one) and a single pancake.  Perfect.    ONE NOTE: they use fake butter so you have to request real butter if you don't want to eat nasty chemical margarine.

But honestly this place might as well be the Dennys across the street. The food is now bland and the quality is mediocre at best. The fruit was old. Maybe frozen and not fresh anymore?  Service took a hit too. I'm in business. So I get it. Profits... But at what cost. Go back to your old ways....

Their protein pancake is one of the best things on the menu- it's huge but light and not too thick or not too sweet. They have fresh squeezed juice which you can definitely taste the difference. I've never had a bad experience here. The atmosphere is pleasant with quirky yet cohesive decorations. Coffee is super bold and they bring a nice sized pot too. The staff is always on point. The price is a little steep- but I'd say worth it over all. For anything comparable the price is good though!",

Portions were large too. - Decor: diner style with cool art pieces. Many egg cartons painted to look like the American flag (also a Pokestop). Also a big US map on one wall with pictures of iconic items from that state.  - Skillets: liked my chicken, chorizo, and green chile one. Loved mixing a sunnyside up egg with the hash browns and proteins. Hub got the insane meat lovers one which had chicken fried steak, sausage, ham, and bacon covered with white gravy. 4 stars  - Eggs benedict: looked a bit sad and hollandaise was borderline neon but taste was on point. 3.5 stars  - Pitcher of water: maybe they're used to dehydrated people in the desert but leaving one for us was greatly appreciated   Midlights: - Protein pancake: they're famous for this yet I didn't quite enjoy the granola nestled in the batter--it isn't as appealing lacking crunch. 3 stars  Lowlights: - Didn't realize they had a variety of mimosas until I saw the tent towards the end of our meal.

Inside is very bland and boring, I guess you could say it looks generic. We were seated fairly quickly given the 10 minute wait. Upon sitting down we noticed our glasses were dirty, this was the case the first time we ate here as well. Our sever was at our table to take our drink orders right away and she brought us clean glasses. The menu selection is big. The food quality is no better than Denny's and for more money. I love huevos rancheros and what they have here is not huevos rancheros, they use flour tortillas with the dish and it is overall bland. Same goes for the other dishes that my friends had, just bland. All the food came out luke warm but very fast. My friends over easy eggs were cooked thru. When my food came out I was given an English muffin with mold on it. The server immediately took the muffin away and brought another which was nice but received no apology from the manager. I wonder how many people ate muffins with mold on them.   Anyway, in a nutshell this place has questionable food quality and bland food to match the bland interior. But the service is quick and nice with easy parking.",

The best part of breakfast was the coffee which was nice and strong.  My scrambled eggs were pretty bad and you can tell it was made from the carton stuff.  And the bacon??  It was cooked beyond recognition and broke into little pieces when I attempted to eat it.  No kidding..  The sausages were just OK, nothing spectacular.    Like I said, the coffee was good but it doesn't make up for the tasteless food and the STEEP prices.  I think we spent close to $25 for breakfast and the whole time I kept thinking we should have gone to Denny's across the street.",

Also, the food wasn't that hot, which was sort of gross.   Overall, I'd give it another shot and pick something else, but if it's still disappointing, I'd move on.",

My son enjoyed the \"dollar pancakes\" from the kids menu which are not dollar sized, they're normal sized pancakes and it comes with 3!  An absolute steal at only $4.99. My husband had the Denver omelette, he said it was pretty good not great, but not bad.  My mom enjoyed the Blueberry waffles, and she said they were amazing!  I liked that they had fresh blueberries on top, not just blueberry pie filling like you find at some places.  Prices are not cheap, but in my opinion very reasonable.  My only real complaint is the service was terrible.  We were in slightly before the rush, by the time we left there was a wait but none when we came in.  I was disappointed that our server couldn't keep drinks filled.  The topper was when she dumped creamer on our table and just brought extra napkins.  Didn't wipe it up, didn't even really apologize to my husband who she dumped it in front of. Luckily he got out of the way of wearing it.    We'll be back, but I really hope the service improves next time.",

Unfortunately, I guess I have to request it to be hot and fresh out of the pan and not to expect that a place that serve solidly on breakfast should know any better. Oh I am sorry you don't serve solidly on breakfast?? Then you probably should take the word eggs out because you don't take your eggs seriously! Serve it hot or don't serve it at all!!!",

Yes, they have all the standard breakfast and brunch foods, but if you look at the back of the menu there is a section titled \"Proteins\" where they list protein pancakes, steak and eggs with a sliced tomato instead of hash browns, eggs with a hamburger patty, omelettes with bacon, salads with lettuce, meats, and cottage cheese, etc. There's even a gluten-free option and it all tastes really good!  Plus, every time I've eaten here, or at the location at Baseline and Mill, service has been great... prompt and with a smile. So if you're looking for a place to grab a quick breakfast or lunch, show your patriotism and head for U.S. Egg!",

The front desk girl told us they were not seating any body else because they close at 2:30.  If you're going post everywhere your open until 2:30 then continue to seat people until 2:30.  My impression is that they lack service.  We went to another place nearby just north of there that remained open until 3.  Unlike US Egg, they were very nice and seemed happy when we walked through the door.  If you're going to not seat people until 2:30, then you should post it on your website.  Hopefully this doesn't get taken down as well.  I felt strongly enough about this that I took the time to write a second review.  Much better options around the area.",

The menu and the decor are the same but that is where the similarity ends.   The pancakes were tiny and my omelette was much smaller which seems impossible since it's a three egg omelette.  I get the same thing every time I go so was surprised the bill was higher; apparently at this location i get charged extra for my egg whites.  The english muffin was burnt and my avacado was bad (see picture).  Sadly a bad experience at a chain that is usually amazing.",

I guess it was fate because we came here and only had to wait about 15 minutes. We were seated outside where we were told it was heated to about 78 but if we weren't pleased to ask for another table. Oh, I forgot to mention the average temperature here is usually in the high 60s low 70s but it's about 59 today. Of course the wind was whipping pretty hard. So, we got another table inside very quickly. The waitress didn't take anytime to come over and took our order. They were very accommodating and allowed for substitutions (with minimal cost). The portion sizes are huge! I ate EVERY bite and shouldn't need anything else to eat for the day. The protein pancakes were as promised, something to come back for. If I ever come back to the area, I will definitely come here. Besides, there are so many other things on the menu that I'd like to try.",

I ordered the chicken mushroom omelet with mushroom cream sauce, hash browns and an English Muffin. It arrived barely warm and upon complaining was brought a side of sauce.  I will not return...my omelet obviously.was either not fresh made or sat in the kitchen too long. Even the muffin had need pre toasted and served as if an afterthought. Hash browns were blah. Mashed inferior...barely crisped at all. My son had eggs over easy with a tiny grilled chicken breast and a side of spinach. Couldn't eat the unseasoned, lukewarm spinach, but his eggs and grill marked chicken were adequately hot. He commented that we might have faired better at Dennys...though we both avoid that alternative. If your looking for a good traditional breakfast, I'd recommend you avoid US Egg. I paid $27. 99 minus tip...water to drink which would be ok if food was hot and better prepared...it was not! Right now turned off of getting a breakfast experience for a while!  Wait staff barely made it to our table to leave bill...let alone ask how the food was.",

But overall I love this spot, ill choose this over Dennys and IHOP anyday!!",

As far as a breakfast/brunchery place, it'll probably hit the spot for most people. They have decent portions, decent prices and a vast selection of menu items.   There is just a few things I would like to see homemade. Their corn beef hash is straight out of a can, their country gravy is straight out of a bag. If I remember correctly it's mixed with 3 qts. cold water, then added to 1 qt boiling water, and SHAZAAM! you have instant country gravy (I'd like to thank my first cooking job at Flying J for leaving that bit of knowledge in my head. )  Any way, the service is pretty good. We were there on a weekday, so business wasn't that bad. But I remember coming here on a Saturday years ago and the poor staff just got pummeled.   So I give this place an average rating with food that will please most. They seem to be in business for quantity over quality.",

My dad and I are staying across the street at the Marriott Courtyard, and decided to give US Egg a try!  So glad we did, as the food, service, and decor were a hit.  The American flag decor was especially appreciated by my dad, who is a veteran.  Our server Monica was fast on the delivery of a freshly brewed decanter of coffee.  We perused the massive menu, and selected two egg based choices.  Dad went with the traditional two egg breakfast, served with bacon, hash browns, and an English muffin.  I ordered the California Eggs Benedict.  No sooner had we sipped our coffee's first slurp...and breakfast was served!  So fast!  Our meals came out in no less than 5 minutes!  Fresh, hot, and nicely prepared.  My dad was very happy with his over easy eggs, yolks soft and runny as he likes, with crisp and large swaths of bacon on the side.  My benedict eggs were fantastic, with large wedges of avocado and thick slices of fresh tomatoes.  Delicious and all bathed in a tangy hollandaise sauce...soooo good!  Also very nice, our served brought us a nice large pitcher of ice water.  So great to re-hydrate here in the desert!  We had a great breakfast here, and I would highly recommend coming here for quick, fresh, and delicious food and service.",

I had corned beef and hash, with hash browns, bacon and sourdough toast. I rarely finish a big breakfast but I ate every bit of this. You really can't beat a classic restaurant place. No major complaints about this location, it's very lively and clean.   One thing I will say is a bummer is not being able to substitute for the eggs on the corned beef and hash meal, it increased my ticket $5 not being able to do that. Other than that it's good.",

Construction in the parking area but not the biggest deal.  Weird odor outside. Something leaked into the parking spots and smells like rotten milk.  The interior seems a bit outdated. The staff is nice. The food is very.... mediocre. Kinda plain and dry. Veggie Benedict was.... ok.  Fresh squeezed OJ was good.",

Lunch we had the Scottsdale Salad and Turkey Melt and were equally happy with the service and the taste of the food. Highly recommend!",

They serve breakfast and lunch until 2:30PM daily, I love breakfast so I haven't ventured over to the lunch menu yet.   They have everything you would expect for breakfast or lunch. Service is great and food comes out fast.   My favorite thing is the Hawkeye omelette. Chicken, bacon, avocado, tomatoes and jack cheese. Amazing!  The omelettes are huge so be hungry!   Weekdays you can usually get seated right away at any hour. Weekends are packed though so expect a wait.   Enjoy!",

    "text": "A solid option for a delicious breakfast in Scottsdale. A popular spot, but we were able to get a table immediately early on a Saturday morning.   The menu has so many great options. The hard part was narrowing to just one breakfast item per person. There are about a dozen options each for omelets, specialties, and pancakes/waffles. Benedicts and traditional breakfast options are also available. U.S. Egg is also a lunch spot.   I had the Going South Omelet which had chorizo, green chiles, and cheese inside. It was served with a side of hash browns. It was a really large and had plenty of filling, especially the chorizo. This is the kind of breakfast that allows you to completely bypass lunch. My husband had the Sonora breakfast burrito. The Sonora has the same filling ingredients as the Going South Omelet, but is all stuffed into a giant burrito. The Sonora also comes with a side of hash browns. Other sides can be substituted at an additional charge. My husband enjoyed his burrito, but the outside is a little on the dry side. It comes with salsa, but it would probably be better smothered Christmas style. Overall, both dishes were satisfying though.",

Most restaurants cheap out with their fruit plates, but not here.   My only request is that they add more benedict plates to their menu. It would be nice to have more options.   Regardless, I had a good, easy, and quick experience here. Thanks guys!",

This made it hard to eat, especially since the egg was dry. The steamed spinach on the side was good, until it got cold and soggy. The waitresses were very helpful and attentive  The price was too high, I can go to a better restaurant up Scottsdale road for a better meal at a cheaper price",

We get there around 1130, NO WAIT at all. Perfect for me because I was getting pretty \"Hangry\". Looking through this delicious menu I wanted everything, but this waitress wasn't going to wait forever, as patient as she was. I'm down to try new things but I know what I like and the ITALY OMELETTE was calling my name. Mushrooms, sausage, mozzarella cheese, marinara and pepperoni on top. What omelette can beat that? Yeah I couldn't think of one either haha. But why stop there? I'm a girl with a sweet tooth so I ordered powered sugar french toast off of the kids menu (pretty filling) and added bananas on top. A little extra charge but who cares when you're hungry right? Just go bananas you'll thank yourself later!!! I also had the pleasure of eating off of my boyfriends plate. He kept it simple & light and ordered a sirloin steak with broccoli. I rather indulge in the good, \"yet not so good for you\" food, but then again that's just me! He splurged a little and got their famous protein pancake. Good for you carb and calorie counters. It was massive, filled with blueberries, granola, cinnamon and almonds. Simply delicious. Now that I have your mouth watering I think it's time you come in and taste for yourself. Remember: Go Bananas!",

On a recent Saturday morning, my friend and I stopped by U.S. Egg in search of a favorite breakfast indulgence - Eggs Benedict.   We were seated promptly, and our friendly waitress highly recommended both the Eggs Benedict (for me) and a slight variation, the California Benedict (including bacon and avocado), for her.    Both dishes looked great when they arrived, and even included a nice side of hash browns.  However, the letdown was immediate when I cut in to my first egg.  The yolk was... solid!  No delightfully runny goodness to mix with the hollandaise.  My friend's eggs were overdone as well.  What happened?  My guess is the dishes sat a bit too long under a heat lamp after being plated.  So disappointing.  :(  I may give U.S. Egg another try, as a number of other menu items looked tempting.  The restaurant was bright and inviting, and the service was quick and friendly.  Still, how can you serve Eggs Benedict with overcooked yolks!?",

Makes it feel more like breakfast  Our server, Whitney, is super nice and knowledgable of the menu I wasn't quite sure of what to get as they have a big menu as well Big place-Big menu, go figure ;) I asked for her recommendations and she was very helpful I ended up getting the decaf coffee  And The chicken fried steak with eggs  Very good portion  The eggs are good, over easy The hash browns are a little dry and plain so I added pepper and ketchup The chicken fried steak has good flavor and the gravy does too  Good first experience",

The bacon is pretty good, but not crispy. Whole wheat pancakes are pretty good, too. Honestly, the food is reminiscent of IHOP, but less greasy/a little better quality.  I don't know if I'd come back, but I wouldn't necessarily shy away either. Overall, 3 stars/A-OK is very accurate.",

One morning, I decided to give it a shot.  I did a little research on Yelp, and I saw that people enjoyed the protein pancakes.  I eat quite a bit of protein supplements, so I was wondering if they somehow infused whey protein powder into the pancake batter.  It actually has fresh blueberries, cinnamon, and almonds.  I think the batter had whole grain wheat.  I decided to go with the half and half, which gave me 2 mini protein pancakes (humongous) and an Idaho Skillet that came with potatoes, your choice of 1 egg, and a type of sauce such as Cajun spices, Santa Fe, or various other assortments.  Each of my friends got the same dish, but with different skillet sauces.  We enjoyed the Cajun, Santa Fe, and chicken avocado.  The best part of the experience is that you definitely get your money's worth.  If you ever have a hard workout or are extremely hungry, come to US Eggs for a power-packed breakfast.",

I can deal with cold bacon, but as I tried to spread the butter across my \"fresh\" waffle, it just \"sat\" on top. Ewww.   Our server was awesome. I was able to let her know right away that although I was ok with keeping the bacon and eggs, I really wanted a hot belgian waffle. She apologized and took it back to the kitchen, where the kitchen committed a cardinal sin... they took the same waffle I just sent back and put it in the microwave.   I suspected it was the same waffle when I saw the caramel-colored brown spots on top where I tried to spread the butter previously, but just to be sure I checked the bottom. Yep; soggy from the microwave.  Ewww.  I was no longer in the mood for a belgian waffle.   I would give it one star, but I appreciated my server, and I actually really like the casual decor, the patio and the restrooms.",

AVOID the \"sauces\"at  ALL COSTS!   Generally, I order extra sauce, but the Hollandaise, Cajun, and \"Gentleman Jim's\" sauces are pretty gross.  The \"Cajun\" sauce is the worst.  A weirdly flavored, brown-tan mess, with bits of gum-chewy mushrooms.  Yuck.      The hosts and wait staff go out of their way to be friendly.  The bright, airy dinning room is nice, and relaxing. Order coffee or tea and get a whole pot.

    "text": "I was looking for a good idea for breakfast in my South Scottsdale neighborhood, and just could not pass by the 27 good reviews of US Egg in good conscience without relaying my very different experience - one of the worst restaurant experiences I've ever had.  I usually like US Egg but had never been to this location until about 6-8 weeks ago. A friend and I were running around doing errands and decided to stop for a quick bite what turned out to be about 13 minutes before closing. We asked if they were still serving, the answer from the host was yes, of course and were shown to our table. I made a quick run to the ladies' room while my friend ordered coffee and got menus. And it was when I returned to the table that things began their nose-dive.    Evidently our waitress had dropped off the menus and told my friend that we needed to hurry and order, and actually expressed annoyance that I was in the ladies room. Hmm. At this point I gave US Egg the benefit of the doubt. People don't actually say things like that! But when the waitress came to take our order, she was clearly annoyed. So much so, I asked if it was too late to get a meal, told her we'd asked at the door when we arrived. She said we'd have to hurry but they were still open. I chalked it up to her being tired at the end of her work day. We ordered immediately, and breakfast arrived quickly.   The food was a disaster: coffee was cold, the eggs were not cooked, the veggies were not edible, the hollandaise was out of a can or other container and had been microwaved or something, still retaining the shape of the container (read not warmed enough). Just thinking about it now, makes me shudder. Honestly, I could not eat it. I tried. We were hungry. While we \"ate\" someone came over to our area and mopped the floor with some very strong smelling cleaning solution. OMG. There was no one else sitting around us. We did not get coffee refills. The waitress left the building. And we had to flag someone else down who was clearly annoyed to have to bring coffee and the bill. She saw that we had not eaten and offered a container, but we declined. A good opportunity to point out the raw broccoli and jellied hollandaise and said we did not want to take it with us, it was not a good meal at all, and we'd wished that they had simply told us no, they could not serve us at the door. She shrugged.    The host/manager sat at a table near the door reading one of the free newspapers from the rack near the door, appearing to be killing time, waiting to close, unaware of what was happening. We did not complain. The problem was with multiple personnel, including him. No one - host, two waitresses, cook(s) and floor clean-up guy took any pride in their work or showed any sign of \"welcoming\" us into their establishment. Instead of being so rude and wasting our time and thiers, they should have politely asked us to come back another time when we came in the door. That would have been fine.    We could not wait to get out of there. I left a minimal tip (I was not going to let them decide my response to their bad behavior). I paused at the door looking back at our table. I was amazed to see that there were at least 3 other tables of people eating, so we were certainly not the last lingering guests. The manager never even looked up from his reading and we walked right by him. On the way to the car I swore to myself that I'd find and write a letter to the *owner* but never did. More wasted time. We were just never going back. Ugh. This was one of the most \"inhospitable\" hospitality experiences I've ever had. I fully expected the restaurant to be closed by now. And instead, I see positive reviews? Bewildering.",

Don't get me wrong, we enjoyed our protein pancakes and scramble just as much as the next Joe...but we haven't been back to US Egg since we went a few months ago, and you're talking to two of the biggest breakfast fans out there. If your looking for a safe, tried and True breakfast place that won't let you down, but won't blow your socks off either, then give Us Egg a shot. They've definitely got some good choices of food on the menu, but somehow this place just didn't hold our attention like some other breakfast spots have. I mean, even there name is so generic and blah..US Egg... how original is that? I think this is definitely a few steps above Denny's, but being a step or two above Denny's is not a very hard thing to accomplish. They should maybe start striving to be a few steps above Denny's and then maybe it will be worth making a second trip back.",

You can order the food the way you like, requesting egg whites, no tomato, whatever you need to rearrange the omelette's or other choices to your taste and the food comes promptly. Large menu which also has lunch items and combos, not just breakfast fare. Nice fruit plate, options for Vegetarians, Omnivores and Carnivores. The wait staff is pretty attentive, keeps up on refills and smiles. The price is about where good breakfast food is these days, this isn't a 99cent breakfast slam, it's approximately 8 bucks per choice, other things are a la cart so it's really simple to get what you like. I got the California Benedict, with just right amounts of canadian bacon, avocado, hollandaise and english muffin. The potatoes weren't burnt or raw, and I could season them myself. Other people got spinach florentine, frittata, steak and eggs, protein platter. Serving size is just right, for the lighter eater, might be a little left over. They can split checks when you ask. Parking lot is decent sized, but this place is popular. My advice is visit around 8:30am. You'll beat the crowd and be very happy.",

They lose a star because as they became more popular, the quality of the food began to diminish in the sense that it seemed rushed. For example, I always order my hash browns extra crispy now, just so that they'll be cooked right, sometimes bacon comes out undercooked, etc. If you're in south Scottsdale and looking for a good breakfast place that won't be a hassle or a long wait, you can't go wrong with US Egg. I recommend the skillets, or the chicken-fried steak and eggs. And always get a side of bacon.",

The setup was Denny's-esque and we almost felt like we were in a cubicle as we ate breakfast. So, that wasn't good. Our server was friendly but it looked like her section had atleast twelve tables in it and it was busy so she barely had time to breathe.

And they were right, the patio was full of people & extremely comfortable and NO FLIES! Something about the heat brings flies but not one found here!  On to the food. Great selections, great taste. I used Yelp to find this place and saw all the skillets, and had to try one. Our server was adorable, young girl, very friendly and chatty. She was at our table for a good 10 minutes just telling us about the area.   The menu has a bunch of protein selections, like protein pancakes, waffles etc, which is really neat when you are trying to eat clean. (I am on vacation so I just skipped that section) but if I had a U.S. Egg near me in California, I would be there much more often which would allow me to select better choices for my waist line. My bf got the protein pancakes with blueberries and said they were delicious.   Why not 5 stars? I think the pricing is a bit high for the portions. Yes, the food is quality but its standard eggs, potatoes, yogurt, oatmeal, nothing too unique here. Maybe its because the location is in Scottsdale? I don't know, I went to another breakfast place yesterday morning in Scottsdale called Randy's (the prices were fantastic, like mouth dropping prices!!",

The food my girlfriend and I received was undercooked, soggy, and unseasoned. We should have sent it back considering the price, which was not cheap. I was immediately sick, and spent the rest of the day lying in bed or in the restroom.  This is the first and last time I will be eating here. Quite simply, this was the worst food I have ever had at a restaurant.",

I was disappointed in my server this time. She came to my table 4 times..................  1) to take my order 2) to drop off my food 3) to drop off my check 4) to take my money  Normally the service is excellent, but I must say, Amber I was truly disappointed. I'm sure I'll be back for the food but not in Amber's section again! I'm sure I would've given 5stars if my service was good. I hate bad service.",

The steak was thick and flame-broiled and I opted for French fries over broccoli. Be sure to get a side of ranch as it pairs well with the fries. Wasn't able to confirm this, but I think they cut their fries in-house...very tasty and crisp, nonetheless. I love the old school brown coffee mugs they serve the coffee in and the fact they serve actual cream with your coffee rather than those little plastic cups you have to peel open. They did bring a carafe, so we were able to just refill our cup rather than waiting for our waitress. Will definitely go back!",

Portions are generous and pricing is decent.  -Coffee $2.99 -banana pancake $6.69 -chocolate chip pancake $6.69 -garden omelette $10.99  The Coffee was perfect and refilled every time. pancakes are huge about the size of a dinner plate, a small portion is good for one person. I wasn't particularly a fan of the protein pancakes they are not your usual fluffy ones. The eggs came with a side of muffin and hash. My muffin was burnt and the hash wasn't done but the server was quick to change them once i pointed that out.  I would love to try the other items on the menu but the service was much better than the food.  Cheers!",

    "text": "If you want a delicious, down home breakfast, then US Egg is the place for you. Don't expect to leave the place hungry...read on....  We had breakfast at US Egg before leaving town after a getaway night in Scottsdale. The interior is clean, the staff is very friendly, and the environment is bright, the signs are quirky, and it's a rather fun place. I ordered the South Omelette with chorizo, cheese, onions, and other veggies. It was huuuuuuuuuuuge and came with hash browns and an English muffin. The breakfast was larger than the breakfast I typically eat at home, but I snarfed this down with no problems or guilt. When something is this good, who can count calories, eh? US Egg also caters to gluten-sensitive and the requirements of gluten-free meals for customers. They have a fairly extensive gluten-free menu and they even made a fresh gluten-free hollandaise sauce for my wife and her omelette.  Also, the staff were very friendly and the vibe of US Egg is very much like a neighborhood restaurant where everyone knows your name and you always look forward to going there.   Overall, if you love breakfast and are in Scottsdale, I highly recommend US Egg. It's just good down home comfort breakfast food. Yum!",

Fortunately, we went to this place last minute after calling ahead to ask for hold times to which I was replied with \"no wait time\".  We went in, and only had to wait for less than a minute for us to get a table in a full house. Our server, Ti, was EXCELLENT. She was very attentive, kind, and was super helpful when my mom accidentally spilled some ketchup on herself. We were very impressed with her service, that we gave her a handcrafted coap from our business that we run as a thank you.  I had the strawberry pancakes with over medium eggs and hashbrowns. She had the blueberry oatmeal with a side of eggs. It was so delicious, and It didn't make me feel super full and bloated that starched pancakes normally would. It's a huge benefit that they make whole wheat pancakes, with decent servings.   I like that they have the coffee pot and water pitcher readily available for you at the table. It takes pressure off the server and customer for when they want refills and how much of a serving they want.   The place was well lit, clean and the bathrooms were very clean too.   Overall, I had a great experience and would come back again!",

    "text": "Ok.  I just paid essentially $12 for a disappointing brunch, and I'm not thrilled about this.  The Sonoran breakfast burrito sounded great-- eggs, chorizo, green chilies, jack cheese, and salsa are among my favorite things to put in a burrito.  This is gonna be awesome, I thought reading the description.  I was hungry and excited about breakfast.  Oh, how let down I was with that first bite! Reality intruded on my fantasy breakfast with extreme prejudice.  I had been burrito- blocked! First of all, the \"meat\" was not chorizo.  Chorizo is deliciously greasy (that good red grease that lets you know its for real) and bursting with spicy flavor.  My burrito had \"chorizo\" in it -- flavorless Sysco breakfast crumbles.  There were also some green things that may have been chilies, and some onions, but neither tasted like the things they were masquerading as.  The only thing I tasted in the whole thing was the splat of tomato salsa on top.  Seriously, the breakfast burrito from McDonald's had more flavor than this poor creature they served me! And you know I can't stand  McDonald's, it is the court of last resort! I was glad to see a decent selection of fruit on my $1.25 upcharge fruit plate.  No complaints there, at least until our server knocked the table flag (the standup display advertising specials, don't know what its officially called) over in the middle of it. Service was not great either, which also fed my irritation about breakfast.   We might be back (I'll get something else), but I can't see being a regular.",

I ordered the half and half which included the southwestern skillet and the protein pancakes! I was highly pleased.   Just a heads up, the portions are huge so you will either be stuffed or not finish. There are many skillet options I chose the southwestern and it was cooked to perfection. They make your eggs anyway you want them. Ask for your hash browns to be extra crispy. You're welcome in advance. If you don't know, the skillet is basically all the ingredients you choose based on your selection, the eggs of your choice and has browns all in one bowl.  The protein pancakes are heavenly! I need the recipe ASAP! It has blueberries and I'm not sure what else but I can't wait until I'm back!  The price is very affordable. Next time I will do another skillet for variety but I will stick to the protein pancakes.",

The food was pretty good and they give you plenty of it. The waitress was very careful to take note of my nut allergy and check with the kitchen on my order and have it cooked on a separate griddle from where the protein pancakes are cooked (they contain tree nuts). The pancakes were huge and pretty tasty.   Everyone was happy with their food. I think we'd come here again. It's not the most gourmet breakfast in the world but it's good. Coffee was pretty bad, sadly.  I'd like to try a scramble next time. They sounded pretty great.",

The building was clean, the staff were friendly, and the ambiance of the room felt homey.  I would consider coming back again for breakfast again!",

After perusing their menu I settled for the Half and half, which is a larger meal with 2 \"small\" protein pancakes and half of their skillet with 1 egg. It filled me up and tasted amazing. The pancakes were fluffy for being made of protein batter and had granola and some dried fruit inside. It really hit the spot. If these were small I can't imagine what the full sized ones look like. I got the Santa Fe skillet, which had diced chicken, chorizo and green Chile on top of hash browns and cheese with the egg on top. Really tasty. Very casserole-like. I was pleasantly surprised at the quality of food and you can be sure I will come back!",

Mine came out at the same time, they took hers back to fix it. Manager dropped off a few pieces of fruit \" for her to munch on\" while waiting--but did not receive an apology for the error. Waiter didn't even stop by to apologize at all. Food was standard, nothing out of the ordinary. Based on reviews, I was expecting a bit better. Waiter dropped off bill, never apologized (again).

All the tables were full, and the servers seemed a bit harried.   My wife got there before I did, as I was having the car checked out before our road trip. I got there about a half-hour later. The server had already given my wife her drink order, and came by to get me mine. That part went well, and I did find the young woman to be pleasant.  After perusing the menu, my Beloved decided on the chicken and waffles. I chose their Triple Play Combo with a side of toast. It took some time for our orders to come out, likely due to the large crowd of customers there at that time. When they finally got to the table, unfortunately my toast and syrup were missing. It took some more time to finally get them.  That being said, as you can tell from the pictures, the food was well prepared. My pancakes were fluffy and delectable. Plus, the bacon was nice and crispy, just the way I like it. My wife enjoyed her chicken and waffles, especially the egg. She hates runny scrambled eggs and found the scramble here to be quite good.   We liked the country decor and the friendly service. It would have been nice to have received our order more expediently, but I give them a pass for the busy day they were having. We'll be back again some time soon.",

The host/hostess is always the first point of contact and we were greeted warmly and seated rapidly even though they were busy; efficient turns. This is a good choice in Old Town as those located right in Old Town usually have a 30 -45 minute wait. I'm not sure about you but when I want to eat, I want to eat!  The offerings are standard for a breakfast restaurant with a few of their own twists on the menu. Our service was excellent and our server looked like Mario Lopez... funny!  Our food came out at the proper temperature and the Mimosas went down smoothly. The decor is nice and the facility is well maintained and located next to the Carter; a higher end condominium community.  We would come back here in a moment and avoid both the wait and crowds. Delish and prompt stop. Put on your Arizona feed bag and drop in!  #irishcatv2 #twylytephotography #vino2ultimate #vinosquared #vino2",

It's perfect because you don't have to decide between sweet or savory. The protein pancakes are something I crave, incredibly flavorful with warm spices, oats and blueberries. The skillets have a wide variety to choose from, wide variety that goes from veggie to meat lovers.   If you order coffee they leave the carafe there for you which is nice, you can add more to keep your coffee hot.   The tall ceilings make the place feel very open but most of the tables and booths have a decent amount of privacy. There is outdoor seating, lots of big parties were out there.   Waiters and waitresses are always very friendly and very attentive. It's a little expensive for the environment you are in (think Denny's with $15 omelettes) but much more relaxed than anywhere else in South Scottsdale.",

I went with your traditional breakfast, eggs, hash browns well done, toast, bacon and sausage. Based on the pics I saw on yelp I went with a side order of bacon, which was the right call. The bacon was juicy and greasy, hehe...just how you want your bacon.    As for toast and English muffins, they were slopped with butter, where most places skimp on the butter, this place did no such thing.   I tried the omelet, but wasn't thrilled with it, but that was after everything I ate, so that may have been part of it.   Also I ordered a fresh apple juice, which was more like an apple cider for us Michiganders...overall, I'd be back. The menu was huge; much more for me to try.",

Both were very nice and friendly GREAT CUSTOMER SERVICE. This place is very large and has a nice customer base. US egg is a family owned business and has been in the family  for many years. Their food is fresh and great quality! they do not use pre frozen ingredients like most chain restaurants. If you're ever in the area I highly recommend you come here. Their portions are great , you always have enough to share. In the morning they have coffee set outside that they offer for free. I highly recommend looking around at the Yelp pictures and checking out the menu. This is a great restaurant I'm sure everything is very good. I will definitely come back when I'm in the area.",

And just because I'm feeling creative today, here's a little something I wrote in honor of U.S. Egg:  U - ultimate place to go for a delicious breakfast S - super friendly staff  E - eggs, pancakes, waffles, and so much more! G - giant portions G - grateful... that's how I feel about having this place so close to home!  I was reminded of how much I enjoy this place after our delightful breakfast this morning.  There was a less than five minute wait to sit down, but the hostess brought me an OJ while I waited which made me very happy!  Once seated, our waitress came over to help us navigate the menu... it had been awhile since our last visit.  Per her recommendation, I went with a half order of the blueberry whole wheat pancakes and a side of egg whites.  A half order is plenty for one person fyi - it comes with a pancake as big as your plate!  It was delicious! J had coffee and a 2 egg breakfast with english muffin and hashbrowns.   I love that they leave a pitcher of water and a carafe of coffee at your table... and fyi this place has plenty of lunch options as well.  If you're looking for a casual place that is consistently good, head over to U.S. Egg... I have to remember to do so more often!",

Ok so it might be a little chain-y and menu's aren't crazy creative, but when it comes to great morning after stodge, you really can't top this place. Typically American large portions of; scrambled egg, hash browns and a choice of bacon or sausage (little tip, ask for a combination) all for under $10 is an absolute steal!  Throw in unlimited (oh how I love the land of the free) coffee and a chocolate chip pancake to measure and you're well on your way to rolling home a happy camper without denting your wallet!",

For the record I told her to hold the tomato, it just didn't sound like the right ingredient to keep in the mix, and I was happy without them even though I normally love tomato, just not for breakfast.

The potatoes could have used to been cooked a bit longer so they were a little crispier. But honestly, same thing different place. Nothing really stood out as better to me than the next place.   I felt like the place was crowded too. The seating that is. Not just because of all the people in there. Ample parking, average prices, friendly staff.",

    "text": "The Boyfriend raved (and apparently the restaurant itself raves) about its famous protein pancakes, so, of course, we had to go!  We went around 11:30am on a Monday morning it was a long weekend) and they place was less than half full. We were seated promptly and drinks orders taken. The server was great about coming back and getting our food orders in a timely manner as well.  We ordered coffee, protein pancakes, the arizona frittata, and a side of biscuits and gravy.  Coffee was good. Just good ol' plain coffee, so I can't complain. The arizona frittata included mushrooms, onions, peppers, and spinach with sour cream on top and a side of salsa all a la egg. It was good, after you put generous amounts of salt and pepper on it, but The Boyfriend still thought it was a bit bland.  The biscuits and gravy were good, no complaints.  Now onto the important stuff: protein pancakes! The order comes as 2 extra large pancakes that have lots of blueberries and crunchy granola in every bite. I was surprised that the pancakes were so tasty, especially since it's healthy (bleh :P)! The crunchy granola gave them an extra kick because it was a different texture and I'd was rather have bits of crunch in my pancakes than mushy oatmeal-like oats. Anyway, if I ever go again, I'm just ordering the protein pancakes!  BTW, the pancakes were so big, we were only able to finish one, so I brought the second one home to the Bay Area and my dad ate it within a day!",

This place has always people waiting outside for tables because it's always packed..which is a good sign especially for first timers that the food most especially is worth waiting for..=)  My good friend and I, more often than not, always get our breakfast fix here with the good old American pancakes, well protein ones for my friend, crisp bacons, eggs, crispy hash brown as we like it, coffee and tea, or occasionally some corned beef hash. We also like their most recent addition, the Cornhuskers, consisting of two pancakes, two toasted bread, 2 eggs, 4 bacons, which is big enough for two people! =) Price is great for the amount of food you shell out for..This is our little spot after working out in the morning and we will never get tired of going here. So happy that we have this locally owned restaurant that serves good food! =)",

    "text": "Standing like a paragon of virtue in a sea of decadence, U.S. Egg's Scottsdale's location is place of redemption, both for your soul and your appetite. Open only for breakfast and lunch, the restaurant attracts as diverse a clientele as the 'dale itself. This is not somewhere that relies on being a tourist trap: some locals are known to eat here daily.  Its location is slightly outside the Old Town Pale, but still within walking distance unless it's the height of summer. Secondly, it has its own parking lot, making it as accessible as Denny's or a Marie Callendars. Nevertheless the lot is often full on weekend mornings, and you will definitely see people waiting. unless you arrive very early or late. There is both an outdoor patio seating area and a large indoor dining room.  Having gone numerous times alone, I am always impressed how quickly I am seated. No bias against tables for one here. The servers are all personable and graceful...yet not self-aggrandizing. This is not a Michelin four-star restaurant however, and you should not expect being waited on hand and foot. Given the volume of service, it's also commendable how few mistakes are made and how prompt everything is.  The food is also excellent. Although you can order both lunch or breakfast, I tend to crave the latter more. There's plenty of variety on the menu and they have both innovative dishes and old staples. This helps to explain why the uber-fab Scottsdale club kids patronize this place just as much as the Cadillac set. Prices are very reasonable for Scottsdale, though perhaps too much for a dirt-poor college student or person living only on Social Security.  The building also capitalizes on Arizona's sunny weather with high ceilings and plenty of windows...causing plenty of light to splash in and helping to evoke that sense of morning and freshness. There's plenty of ambient noise as a result...but it's almost reassuring. Not to mention that the hearing-aid crowd and club crawlers may be too deaf to notice.  U.S. Egg is not flawless, however. From a cost point of view, the restaurant has to contend with the fact that breakfast is usually the cheapest meal of the day. Without a dinner menu though to recoup cost, diners have to grin and bear any perceived cost imbalance from say  Denny's. Neverthless it's still worth it, in my opinion. The other shortcoming stems from the food. Different dishes often rely on the same sides. If you get sick of their potatoes for example, you can be really out of luck despite ordering something different every time. Moreover their signature dishes again may not impress truly demandng foodies.  While it may not cure your hangover (or incontinence), U.S. Egg remains firmly on the map for locals. Managing to please all of Scottsdale is a tall order, and the owners, managers, and staff all should stand tall and be proud.",

Sure,the tables are sometimes sticky, the menu (and the mural of America) is a little ,and there's often a short wait to get a table. But the food (especially the Jack and Avocado omelet - yum!) is great, the prices are reasonable, and the servers are always friendly. And even though there is often a line, they never rush you to finish your coffee. Also, the Scottsdale US Egg is a great people-watching venue. Whether you're an ASU student grabbing a post-church bite to eat with your parents, or a gal out with your friends after a Camelback hike, or a slightly hungover woman wearing last night's halter top, sitting across from a some guy  you met last night-- and you can't quite remember his name -- US Egg will hit the spot.",

This gave us time to go over the sizable menu.  I had the Sonora Breakfast burrito.  It was SO freakin' good!  Lots of chorizo -- which was surprising, because that seems to be the first thing they skimp on.  It also had peppers, eggs, and several other very yummy things.  It came with potatoes that were really good too.  My friends got one of the veggie frittatas, and thought it was fabulous.  Our waitress was sweet, chatty, and very helpful.    The only thing that wasn't great was the coffee -- it was just OK.  This is one of those places that should become a weekend routine!",

    "text": "There are good breakfasts, and then there are the type that make you wonder what the hell you've been eating up until that point.  US Egg in Scottsdale made that type of impression on me.  Walking in, one might think that it was little more than a Denny's wannabe on steroids.  The place has the look of trendy/family style cooking.  It came off a little crowded which means one of two things, the food is really good, or the place that is merely convenient and cheap.  Service was prompt.  The waitress asked for my drink order, and coffee and water were everything I needed.  She came back quickly with a pitcher of both, that she left on my table, a nice touch for those who are addicted to either...which I am.  Open only during breakfast and lunch, the menu caters mostly to that, with the breakfast menu dominated by, you guessed it, eggs.  Feeling rather adventurous, I went the chicken embryo route.  The Triple Play is basically eggs, four slices of a breakfast meat (bacon or sausage) and wheat pancakes.  I almost ordered that, but saw that you can upgrade the pancakes to protein pancakes.  My curiosity was sparked, and I read that they were pancakes with cinnamon, granola and blueberries.  It sounded good enough, so I went for the upgrade....and thank God that I did.  Once the food got there I was immediately intrigued by what lie before me.  Two eggs, four slice of bacon and two golden brown pancakes.  First I went to the eggs.  If this meal is going to be any good, and they can live up to their name, these were going to be good.  Upon first taste, I knew that the rest of the meal was going to be great.  The eggs where cooked perfectly, and were even seasoned with salt and pepper.  The bacon was honestly cooked, not over done, but not limp and undercooked.  Dare I say, it was perfect.  I ate with delight, but my eyes couldn't get off the protein pancakes.  Soon enough, I was there, fork in hand, thinking I knew what I was in for...I had no clue what my taste buds had in store for them.  The cinnamon was perfect in it's seasoning, no too much by any means.  The granola, which I was skeptical about from the very beginning, but was proven wrong for such thoughts.  They were a different flavor and texture, that helped take the pancakes to new heights, and the blueberries weren't bad either.  But these pancakes were like nothing I've ever had before, a complete orgasm for the senses.  To say that this was the best breakfast of my life would be overstating.  I would say that it was definitely in the top three of my all time breakfast meals.  I would recommend US Egg, and was definitely urge whoever goes there to get the protein pancakes, they are worth the trip.",

    "text": "I debated on a 5 vs a 4 for this place. To be honest though, everything pointed to a 5, I was just bitter that I had to wait for my breakfast after everyone else was eating. But, they did smooth it all over and I was a happy camper once it came.   This place became our breakfast of choice based on proximity to the ballpark and great yelp reviews. Some friends joined us for breakfast, coming all the way from Surprise. We just ventured on down from North Scottsdale. This place did have that chain breakfast feel to it, but the menu seemed to set it apart from the rest.  It was a Sunday morning, and as expected, there was a wait. We had a larger than average party, with 7. The weather was not bad, so we waited out front and just chatted. The wait was about 30 minutes and we ended up being seated on the patio. I think we would have preferred inside, but there were heaters and it ended up being just fine.   Our orders varied from egg dishes to protein pancakes, biscuts and gravy to a side of eggs. Overall everyone was very happy. The biscuits and gravy folks were quite happy. The best option price wise on that actually seemed to be a side of biscuits and gravy. It was only one biscuit but it was inexpensive and then you can order a muffin or side of eggs and keep even our pickiest young eater happy. SG enjoyed his omelette and bacon. I LOVED my protein pancakes. They have granola in them. Absolutely delicious! I was upset initially that everyone else was served (including two other protein pancake orders) and that they had not made mine to serve at the same time. But, to smooth it over, they brought me a plate of fresh fruit and the manager even came over later to apologize personally.   I think this place does it right. The food is good, the service is both good and respectful, and the setting is great (especially for a baseball game.)   ***** A little sneaky fact, the dirt parking lot across the street is FREE and you can park there and walk the 3 blocks to the ballpark. No hunting around for parking and reading all the signs to make sure that you will not get a ticket. Just leave us a spot when we are there....",

I went here to Yelp; with the average high reviews; and having it a block away - I was looking forward to getting myself a bang-ass meal!  The interior didn't look as cozy as I had hoped - tables, chairs, floors were in the same color pine, and the walls were yellow. I wasn't too impressed yet. The host greeted me immediately, and took me to a table.   I waited about 5 minutes before the server came by. She didn't introduce herself, nor did she tell me what the specials were - and the only reason that I know this is because I had seen them on the blackboard. She took my drink order, which was water, and she left and came back with a full pitcher of water with lemon. She eyeballed my glasses, and said, \"oh, they look dirty!\" and left and came back with another.  Nonetheless, the server was super nice - typical college student.  I went with the Eggs Benedict with extra avocado added, and after only about 10 mintues, she came back with my order.  None of it was hot; the poached eggs were lukewarm, and the muffins, and hash browns, were room temperature.  The muffins - looked to be wheat - which I don't remember being indicated on the menu! Things like this are important to call out - if customers order it and have a food allergy.  The avocado was cold because they had just taken them out of the refrigerator. The sauce wasn't too heavy, but could've used just a tad bit more lemon. Overall, the taste of it was pretty OK, but could have been much better if the temperature was right-on-the-moeny.  I gave my feedback to the server, asked me if I wanted another one; I mentioned that I was traveling, and didn't have the time. Because she was apologetic and offered to correct the situation in a way that she knew how, her response was reasonable.  I gave my feedback to the manager, who was receptive, and though I provided my feedback AFTER I paid the bill, the right thing to do for him would have been to offer a credit. If he had offered one, though, I wasn't planning on taking it nonetheles. I wouldn't have taken it nonetheless, but it's all about the principle of the matter. I intentionally paid my bill before providing feedback.  All-in-all, I SEE the potential in both the service, and the food, though my humble opinion is that they would probably benefit from better mentorship or training from the manager.",

    "text": "This place should be 4 1/2 stars.  Service very fast but sincere and patient.  The protein pancakes are as good of a pancake as there is.  It's a cakier pancake with blueberries and granola on wheat flour.  You can order the pancakes only, or you can upgrade your eggs and pancake special to include the protein pancake.   The eggs are perfectly cooked.  It's convenient to get to and it put a big smile on my face as even during lunch hours, it, thank god, serves breakfast.  The interior is a tan colored minimalist look but with an American theme that has this interesting blown up map of the United States.  Bathrooms are clean also.  The only thing that prevents this place from being five stars is that  the coffee isn't eye opening.  If they serve Starbucks Coffee or something stronger or comparable, there will be no better breakfast place than it.  But in this part of the US, the good American Breakfast joint is ubiquitous.",

Our server, who seemed more interested in getting us in and out, rushed through things and forgot that we wanted to dine in the restaurant instead of having our order put in to-go boxes.  We informed her that we wanted to eat there, and after a long wait had to leave due to another appointment. We weren't even given the opportunity to complain to an actual manager! Instead, we were treated to another senior waitress who gave us undeserved attitude. We promptly left and most likely will not return. There are plenty of breakfast places around Old-Town Scottsdale to choose from, I'd avoid this one.",

The service is good, the food quality good, and the portions adequate, but I find the prices a little high. $9 for one egg/sausage sandwich with a small bowl of cottage cheese is pricey. The same price for a fruit plate, but they bring you half a melon (you cut it yourself). I'd rather half half the food they put on my plate for half the price. You can't take home and reheat eggs so it's stuff it all in or waste it.  The wait line can be unbearably long on weekend mornings. So long that one time we walked across the street to Denny's instead of waiting in line at U.S. Egg.  But, I'll have to say that this is one of my  first choices of sit down and wait to be served places to have brunch so I know I'll be back.",

I had the chicken bacon avocado omelet and the bacon and or chicken was rubbery at times, This is not a sensation I enjoy when eating eggs. The ceiling was also dripping water on my date which is rarely a fun time. I will say that there are a lot of choices of omelets and our server was extremely sweet and attentive to our table.

Have lived in Scottsdale for 26 years and can name many places to get fantastic breakfast food for half the price.  Do yourself a huge favor and eat someplace else!!

I went for breakfast on a Saturday, and I was surprised it wasn't very crowded. I went w/a friend & her aunt, and we all enjoyed our meals. I got an omelette, that came w/hashbrowns & an English muffin. It was solid. I also had coffee, and I liked that they left a carafe at the table, because, well...I drink a lot of coffee.

I couldn't finish them they just tasted off.  Kind of unfortunate for a place called the US Egg.  The English muffin was by far my favorite part so that's saying something.

The waitresses were friendly, but moved as slow as glaciers. My burger was decent enough, and my family enjoyed their food as well. The parking situation was bad, and with the new apartments being erected next door, it looks like US Egg has to share their garage in order to fit customers. Kinda weird, but a nice option to be able to get your car out of the million degree sun, even if you have to walk a bit in return. The biggest complaint came from a stereotypical Californian couple (he was wearing a Giants hat) sitting close to us. Half way through our lunch the guy decided to put on some Rihanna (or other hideous pop music) at full volume on his phone so the whole outdoor patio could hear it. Naturally his ditzy girlfriend had to talk even LOUDER (if that was at all possible) over his teenie bopper music. I even caught the guy dancing a bit and singing along to the music, with his leg literally draped over the armrest on his chair. Class act. No one from the restaurant asked him to turn it off, despite the dirty looks these two were getting from other customers. And in case you're wondering, the guy couldn't sing. He should stick to his day job, whatever that may be.",

Although this is is not a place I would go to again and again, it was a good try.",

My hotel was across the street from US EGG and from the looks it seemed like a nice place to check out.  The staff was friendly (super friendly). I got the vibe that this was the spot for locals to discuss about work, family, and politics (the convos I overheard ).  Anyway, my review, the food was average, mediocre, but good.  Don't expect to be blown away by the food.  You get a good portion for what you pay for.  I had the protein pancakes, eggs, and hash browns.  Coffee was \"eh\" average coffee.    Next time I'm in PHX would I eat there???  Unfortunately, probably not. I believe there are some better places to eat in old town Scottsdale.    Overall... Average with good service and a clean restaurant. B-",

A nicer and classier environment than Denny's but the quality of food is similar (well, slightly better) and a bit pricier.  Service here was really friendly however.  Ordered the Triple Play (pancakes, eggs, and bacon) but substituted the regular pancakes with their famous protein pancakes which are packed with oatmeal, blueberries and cinnamon.  Bacon and eggs are always good, tough to mess those up.  The protein pancakes had a nice flavor, but the oatmeal which is mixed within the batter before they are poured on to the griddle actually messes with fluffy texture that I enjoy whenever I eat pancakes.  If you are really big on breakfast and brunch food and don't want to eat at a nationwide chain restaurant it may be worth it to check this place out, just temper your expectations on the protein pancakes.",

However, I'm very very happy that we didn't go to Over Easy because this place probably is so much better!  When my friends and I went here on a Sunday morning, surprisingly it was not that crowded.  We were seated right away and I was very pleased.  But, when I looked at my nasty dirty cup for water, I was like..ewww.  What else do they not clean???  Luckily for them, their food was bomb.  I got the Veggie Frittata plate.  Their servings are huge and I was pretty full even before halfway of my food being eaten.  The prices were okay, regular breakfast place prices...about $8 per plate?  There were a lot of things to chose from so that's always a plus.  By the end of my meal I was like, what dirty cup???",

I asked for coffee when we ordered and did not get it until I was almost completely done eating.  The eggs were like little yellow bricks.  The owner/manager stands at the front with a scowl on his face and just doesn't look pleasant at all.

Meanwhile, the Bloody Mary was so bad I had to dump so much hot sauce to even drink it. The only good thing was bacon. My food came fast but was awful. The hash browns are so mushy and disgusting they are almost watery. My eggs Benedict had literally one drop of hollandaise sauce. And it was terrible. The ham could not even be cut it was so bad. No one ever asked me how my food was once. My server never came back after taking my order. And don't call me \"sweetie\" to try to make up for it. Waste of time and money. WAAAAY overpriced.",

We sat out on the patio, which was lovely, until a group of women were seated next to us. I think they forgot to shower and decided that they should overload themselves with perfume. We were literally gagging throughout our meal. Obviously not US EGG's fault, but it made for a worse time.   I was debating a hot skillet and the protein pancakes and I almost ordered both until I happened to see the half-and-half. It was like heaven shone a light right onto this menu for me and created exactly what I wanted. Perfect!   My food was perfect. My two dining partners, however, received limp, soggy bacon. Nobody wants limp, soggy bacon... so Max makes mention and asks for more bacon. The lady actually charged him as a side, despite the fact that his original bacon was inedible. Um, Wha?!? When she brought the bill he disputed it and she got it removed, but it never should have been there in the first place.   Finally, the bathrooms there are not good. They smell bad and there were paper towels laying all over the place. I hate a dirty bathroom.   I will give this location another chance, but I will sit inside.

In doing so, you'll get to devour one of the best burgers to be found in downtown Scottsdale.  The second version of this two-store operation (the first is in Tempe) offers terrific breakfast and lunch grub at reasonable prices. I've had the eggs and all that. They're good, too. And, I suspect, most people come for breakfast rather than lunch. But if you're steering your car into the neighboring Red Lobster or Olive Garden, or, for goodness sake, Denny's to stuff yourself full of corporate crap, stop. Do yourself a favor and pull into the U.S. Egg. Or do other people a favor and park in the Red Lobster/Olive Garden lot and go to U.S. Egg. Perhaps the lot will, with your help, fill up and terrible eating disasters will be avoided.  Anyway, U.S. Egg has burgers, sandwiches, eggs, pancakes and all that stuff. They're open everyday until 2:30 p.m. Seating was speedy as was the friendly, helpful service during our visit. The atmosphere is mellow and the two-seat booths offer a coziness not found at other joints. It's easy to overlook this place, for whatever reason. Stick it in the back of your mind and try it out someday. I think you'll be happy you did.  * You'll find the menu, hours, addresses and other such information on the website.",

Our waitress was pretty funny and definitely knew we were super hungover-she skipped giving us glasses and just gave us a whole pitcher of water. Portions are big and food is A+. I definitely recommend the protein pancakes-they were my favorite thing I had. Also had scrambled egg whites, hashbrowns, bacon, and toast; all of it was perfect. Topped it all off with a grapefruit juice to take care of the hair of the dog and we were ready for our next Spring Training game! Will definitely return here next year.",

    "text": "For  a place that specializes in breakfast, omelets in particular, they were TERRIBLE!!! Be ready for a giant lukewarm pan sized egg scramble placed on top of your cold fillings and if cheese is one of the fillings, it will be placed on the top of the flat egg thing, not melted. If you want a good breakfast for a lot less money go to Randy's on Chaparral Rd (cash only). Skip this place for a breakfast, you'd make a better one at home, save your money. Service was not great either, the waitress was looking for fast turn over and must not realize she gets tipped on her service. Was here on a Friday, 10-1030 am. Never going back.",

    "text": "Been to the Egg countless times.  It is consistently good. I must add that my review is based solely on breakfast food as i've never ventured to the lunch side of the menu. I love those protein pancakes and have yet to meet a person who didn't thoroughly enjoy them. Since i am a fan of savory foods at breakfast, lately i get the Half & Half. This way i get 2 good-sized protein pancakes and half of a scramble. The sausage & bacon scramble is good as well as the chicken & avocado scramble. Their breakfast potatoes are yummy, i like mine with syrup! Its great hangover food and you can usually get a table within about 10 minutes. The service is consistently good here and food is out so quick, which is prob why the wait times are low. It does get busy on wknds after 10am, so be prepared for crowds waiting.",

Almost too clean, but I guess it's better to be that way than too dirty.  I had the Texas Omlette with Chili that was a good option.  Add a bit of Tabasco for kick and it's perfect.  Sitting outside under the deck and read the New York Times - was not rushed, but service was also attentive.  Good local joint for breakfast!",

    "text": "A sign of a good breakfast joint is a long wait to sit down. This place is pretty standard and basic - giant lofty room with wooden benches, glass plates, cheap flatware, chipped coffee mugs and your own coffee themos carafe to pour your own coffee. This place is standard and generic in every way - and that's a good thing. They take a formula that works everywhere and they run with it.   The food is fantastic - some of the fluffiest scrambled eggs I've ever eaten actually... tasty bacon... yummy protein pancakes.   The staff is great too - chipper and polite and cute. This place is a well-oiled machine doing one thing very well. The prices are pretty reasonable and even though we were 7th down on the list to wait - we were told it would only be 10 minutes and it was. Efficient, tasty, and reliable.  As a side note - perhaps one of the best parts about this place is that it's not the Breakfast Club and you don't have to look like you just went to the club... non-pretentious breakfast. Yum.",

    "text": "I've been going to US Egg for about five years, and over that time the food has remained consistently great.  Their menu is large and is a good mix of the healthy and the, well, less healthy.  The protein pancakes are their signature dish, and although I'm not sure I believe the low \"net carbs\" they describe on the menu, they are still really tasty and very unique.  I've had a variety of omelettes and scrambles here and I really like them all.  But most of the time I order the half-and-half which is a plate of a smaller portion of protein pancakes and a dish of their homefries mixed with veggies meats or cheese (there are a couple of options) with an egg on top.  I always have them add a second egg to get the egg-meat-cheese-potato balance just right.  It can be crowded on the weekend, especially during spring training and typical busy tourist times.  The prices are very reasonable and the portions are big.",
