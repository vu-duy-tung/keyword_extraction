I am glad that we did not order what showed up it looked like I tried to cook it and forgot it in the fryer. Greasiest dumpling I have ever seen.  I should have taken a picture. We usually order China Wok every Sunday they were closed for Easter so we called yummy yummy huge mistake.... Next holiday we will just make food.",

Obviously, as a frequent traveler to Asia I have quite an inderstanding of how Chinese food differs from American-Chinese food... but sometime you just want some comfort food in the form of sugary, deep fried chicken and rice!  Sadly, the food at Yummy Yummy was the toal opposite of its name.  What I received was bland, and somewhat generic tasting.... almost like they prepared things ahead of time, and then added some additional seasonings to try to match the order (in this case, orange flavor).  I've yet to find a good Chinese place in Phoenix, and this place certainly is on my list of bad ones.",

    "text": "Big mistake ordering something with meat in this dive. The veggie fried rice is still good, but this is possibly the worst version of white meat chicken in the history of white meat chicken. It is slimy, and yellow color and inedible. This is what junky Chinese places do to your poultry. It must cost them a dollar around or I'm not even sure where this stuff comes from. An absolute mess. If you have any self respect and trust me a little, please do not order the chicken here. That chicken was in a dish of thin rice noodles which were equally disgusting. They tasted like someone throw a coating of old fish sauce on them and then served them up right from the ocean. It reeked of fish oil and juice and it was an injustice to serve this stuff to the public. Fried rice be damned, I'm taking my business as far away as possible from this punk ass fake ripoff place. New York would laugh this craphole out of the area code in a New York minute.",

It was almost cold, which seemed a little odd for a quick delivery from 3 miles away.  Other than being cold the food looked really good, but the Little Lady immediately noticed the cashews she had paid an extra $2 for were not included in her meal.  Boo.  Then I had my first bite of General Tso's chicken...and it tasted like battered packing peanuts!  Holy great wall it was bad, worst Generals chicken I ever had.  No flavor whatsoever.  I was starving so I doused it in hot sauce and soy sauce (don't even try the duck sauce--not sure of it's composition but not good) and scarfed some down and tossed the rest.  And now I sit here waiting, wishing, and hoping my iron stomach comes through and I avoid any double dragon action over the next 12 hours.  Wish me luck.",

    "text": "I would like to begin this review by saying that I went to it with an open mind. I had been wanting to go try this place out since I came home one day to find a menu taped to my front door. All the dishes were priced reasonably and the restaurant was about five minutes from my apartment. I read all the reviews on here before going, and upon seeing that they were mostly mixed reviews I decided to go and check it out once and for all. The menu states clearly at the top that the place is under new management, and from what I know, that usually means that the place should be running better than ever. Not in this case.  When I first got there, I noticed that there weren't very many people in the restaurant besides a couple sitting in one of the booths. There were two gentlemen ahead of me, the first had a large take-out order, the second ordered to dine-in.   My turn came to order. All I wanted was Chow Mein with Beef. Simple enough, right? I had to repeat my order to the girl behind the counter four times, on the fourth I pointed to the menu where the Chow Mein choices were featured. She nodded and then asked me if I wanted a large or a small dish. I asked her how big the containers were and she didn't seem to understand what I was asking. I asked her again, slowly, and she nodded and pointed at the containers behind her. I ordered a small, it seems like a good proportion. I paid my $11, got my drink, and sat down at a booth.  The surface of the table was sticky, but I chalked it up to the waiting staff just having overlooked it. I wiped the surface with a napkin and waited for my food to arrive. An older Asian woman approached me with a plate full of food, and I was impressed with how quickly she brought it over. She said something that I didn't understand and I asked her to repeat it. Finally, I realized she was saying Kung Pow Chicken. I shook my head and told her that I hadn't ordered that. She insisted that the chicken was my order, despite the fact that the gentleman who had been in front of me at the register was waving her over, claiming the dish as his.  The lady laughed and took it over to him.  The girl who took my order came back over to ask me what I had ordered, and I repeated my order to her. She smiled and said she would go tell them in the kitchen.   A young Asian man, after another five minutes of waiting, brought me a paper plate with beef and broccoli. He put in front of me and before I could say thank you, he said, \"Sorry, not yours\" and walked away.  The older Asian lady came out once more and brought me the same dish that the boy had just brought over and said this was my order. I asked her what it was and she said that it was what I ordered. I asked her if this was Chow Mein with Beef because from what I could see, there were no noodles anywhere to be seen. The lady pointed to the girl and said that she told her I had ordered what she put before me.  I should probably say that I hardly ever make a big deal about not getting exactly what I want at a restaurant, but everyone at this restaurant seemed to be clueless as to what I had ordered even after I repeated the order multiple times.  I told the lady that I had not ordered the beef dish she placed in front of me. I thanked her and told her to forget it. I stood up to leave and she told me to sit down, quite rudely, and that she would get a manager. I shook my head and told her that it was fine, it wasn't a big deal, but that I was leaving. She kept telling me to sit down, very loudly now, and she ran back to the kitchen. I simply walked out of the restaurant without even asking for a refund. I doubt they would have been able to handle a simple transaction like returning my $11.  I drove a couple of blocks over to Panda Express after that.",

I specifically ordered the chow mein with no garlic & light on the onions. They put sooo much garlic in it & onions that it was repeating on me all night. This has happened many times when we ordered food from there. My mom asked for no pepper in the shrimp with lobster sauce. There was tons of pepper in it. She can't eat spicy foods. There shouldn't be pepper in that dish anyway. My dad asked for low salt in the lo mein. Again they didn't listen & made it so salty. He is not allowed to have all that salt. We will not be going back there. I don't understand why they can't make the food the way we like it. Their menu says all dishes can be altered to your taste. I'm originally from ny/nj & I know how chinese food should taste.",

True, there is no atmosphere, but I don't really care.  Also True that the service is less than friendly.  Whatever-- I have lower expectations for a place from which I really only intend to mostly order takeout.  Quick rundown:   Crab rangoon is okay.  A little thin, but the quality of the fried dough part is pretty good. Duplings (like potstickers) are okay.  The dough is good, but the meat inside isn't awesome... it was fine, though. Chicken fried rice was okay. The best thing was the orange chicken.  It was a little too breaded and a little too stringy for my taste (I am totally spoiled by Pei Wei), but the flavor was pretty good, and it had enough of a spicy kick for me.    All of the above, plus 2 soft drinks was $28.  Not bad.  So I would probably go back, but only if I just need to eat something quickly.",

The house special fried rice + broccoli chicken were actually great choices even compared to some of the other Chinese restaurants in the area. I believe their closing hours are actually until 10 PM on most weekdays despite the 9:30 PM closing time that's mentioned on here.  Never ordered delivery from here so I'm not sure what that's like but the pickup/takeout was very convenient for me. The prices are very reasonable and portions were generous.

I usually order the Sweet n Sour pork, Broccoli Beef, or Teriyaki Chicken, which are repeatedly offered in just about every other Asian restaurant. But, Yummy seems to do it better :D  Delivery is very quick! IT usually only takes about 20 minutes to deliver to my business in Old Town. And the prices are unbeatable for the amount of food you receive.. they really hook it up! One delivery usually lasts me three to four meals!  Definitely recommended.",

    "text": "Unfortunately me and my girlfriend tried this place tonight for the first time and absolutely regret it. All of our food quickly went into the trash and became a quick sad waste of $35!   We didn't order much and it was still expensive but I figured it'll be hefty portions? Nope. I got the chicken fried rice, two orders of crab rangoon's (labeled as puffs), a can of soda, white steamed chicken with white rice and sweet and sour sauce. My girlfriends steamed chicken came with no rice and it was a pretty small bowl of chicken. All of that was disappointing considering it was $10 alone!! She took one bite of it and spit it out saying it was disgusting and slimey. It quickly went in the trash. My chicken fried rice was unlike ANY I've had. There were a ton of vegetables in there that were not expected or wanted. I've never had any fried rice that had these. It was like lo mein with rice. I TRIED picking around them but it was impossible. It seemed it would be good without them but I'll never try again to see. The crab rangoon's were not warm at all nor crispy. Not one item of our food was pleasant! NOTHING!  I have been desperate for some yummy Chinese since I moved to Arizona and Yummy Yummy Chinese definitely doesn't live up to its name!!! The only thing I kept were the rangoon's but I'm pretty sure those will get tossed eventually from being uneaten. We were wanting to try and venture out and it was a regret! Please take the bad reviews on here to heart. I tried to assume it was a this or that situation but clearly wasn't. They're just bad! I think those who like it have bad taste and like cold food. Go to China Wok down the street. It's still expensive but you get more food that is better than this and it'll be fresh and warm!!!",

They messed up an order for the first time the other night. No big deal, called and they fixed it. So today I was bragging to a coworker about their amazing food. We ordered lunch and talk embarrassing!! They changed the way the lunch comes (meat and veggies used to come in a small plastic bowl and the rice in the little take out box. Now it's all in a small bowl with literally a scoop of meat and veggies in a bowl full of rice.). When I called to ask about it the lady said she \"I don't know anything, I just work here. There is no manager. Oh he'll be here tomorrow, no we are closed tomorrow\". And now you have to ask for utensils as well. Which the lunch specials come with soup, so when you ask for utensils you think you would get a spoon as well. It's sad you cannot get employees who understand customer service.",

We live about a mile away and have always waited at least that amount of time and usually the delivery doesn't occur until after we call them and get the \"our driver just left\" line.

Not salty, not mushy but flavorful and hearty as it should be. The lo mein is also hearty and plentiful. The beef fried rice also the same. The one thing I need to point out is this place does NOT skimp on the meat. Perhaps a little too much in fact, which is never a bad thing. Generous portions and even healthier portions of chicken/beef/protein!   I also ordered mapo tofu and was super surprised at how not oily it was and normally you don't get soft tofu but you do here.

Well, we don't know of all that many places nearby, so Yummy Yummy it is.  We ordered take-out and I was glad as the restaurant is very small, and not so nice.  However, our order was ready before we could even drive there.  As for the food...it was A-okay.  The hot & sour soup was very good and great given our frigid temperatures lately.  The beef pepper steak would have been terrific had the beef just a little more flavor on its own.  Sweet & sour chicken...well isn't it all the same?  I was wishing there were pineapple & bell peppers in the mix though.  Just a box of lonely chicken with sauce on the side.  The only disappointment, the fried wontons for the soup were cold, over-fried, and just not good.  I really hated myself for eating them...all of them....the whole bag.  But anything resembling a chip is at risk in my house.",

Secondly, I haven't stepped foot into the restaurant once (in my experience strip mall Chinese places aren't always the nicest looking on the inside)...  Those two things aside, I get take out from them often. The quality is good, they're super prompt, and the food is always hot.  So for what it is, it's convenient and decent.   I like that they'll sub anything --- If you want make it a Tofu dish, or Shrimp.  I usually get the Tom Yam Soup with Shrimp - Very good Orange Shrimp (I just ask them to make it) - Good Shrimp with Broccoli - Good.  I don't know about anything else...because it might be risky!  FYI - When ordering some of you complain about an accent on the phone. Use your brain, if you say \"Number 12 please...\" and she replies in a thick accent  \"wahtah ehg drahp\" She's probably relaying your order \"wonton egg drop\". Use your head. It's not complicated...and you're just being tactless.",

    "text": "Yummy Yummy Asian Food is now sitting in my tummy tummy.  I thought for sure I'd get the FTR on this one, but Adam and Norman beat me to the punch... I'm always excited to see new restaurants open up in my hood, especially ethnic restaurants.  So after dinner at Noodles Ranch last week, I picked up a menu from this place.  And when my hunger struck this evening, I decided to call in and place an order for take out.  Good thing I decided to take out instead of eat in, because this restaurant has no ambiance at all.  It was empty on a Saturday night and reminded me of the fast food Chinese places you see at food courts in malls.  The people working there were not very welcoming either... and when I suggested they add an eggplant dish to the menu, they basically just said 'no' without even entertaining the idea.  When I came home with my bag, I noticed that they didn't include chopsticks, utensils, napkins, soy sauce or fortune cookies.  What Chinese restaurant have you ever been to that didn't have fortune cookies?    Anyways, I ordered the Mu Shu Vegetable and the Mixed Vegetable with Shrimp in the \"Health Food Section\" of the menu.  I probably would not describe either dish as \"yummy yummy,\" but they were satisfactory. The portions were large and the vegetables were fresh, but the garlic sauce that came with the shrimp dish was pretty nasty.    I would possibly give this place another chance in the future for take-out in a pinch, but I'd highly recommend hitting up Noodles Ranch, Tottie's, or Lao Thai if you're wanting yummy yummy Asian food instead.",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I am a vegetarian.   Five stars for their tofu dishes   I have been looking for Yummy Yummy for about 8 years since my favorite Asian place in Flagstaff closed.   Vegi Food: I have had two dishes here so far and both were excellent. I ordered the Mongolian Beef (no beef sub tofu) and Sesame chicken (no chicki sub tofu). What makes this place stand out above 99% percent of Asian restaurants is that they lightly bread their tofu and fry it. The bread coating is an absolute must have to enhance the tofu. I can stomach plain cold tofu right out of the container but if you give it to me breaded and fried, then I am ecstatic. One note, if you get a tofu dish, I recommend dining in because the breading usually gets moist and soft if not eaten immediately. The vegetables are also very fresh here and not overcooked, I would almost describe my broccoli in the sesame tofu as raw or lightly steamed.  Ambiance: Nice or Normal, not much to expect from a strip mall restaurant.   My brother and cousin both had meat dishes, General Tso's chicken and Happy Family. They both enjoyed their meat dishes.   I highly recommend the vegetarian dining here and its the best quick Asian I have found in the Scottsdale & Thomas area.",

    "text": "Ok, I am reviewing this so I will go with 3 stars.  If my boyfriend were reviewing he would give it no more than 1 star.  Especially after getting sick because of it.  Here is the difference... Both times we have eaten here I have had the tofu dishes.  1st time was sesame tofu with brown rice and the 2nd time was Mongolian tofu with brown rice.  Both times, I thoroughly enjoyed the tofu.  The meals are greasy delicious chinese fast food and I can have leftovers the next day.  My bf ordered chicken dishes.  The 1st time he ordered the orange chicken.  I tried it and it was ok, but 1 bite was enough for me and I ended up sharing some of my tofu dish with him.  The 2nd time he ordered yellow curry chicken.  It was bland in every aspect,  The color of the curry sauce was dull, the spice and flavor of the curry was light, and the consistency of the curry sauce was watery.  The chicken had a weird taste and texture and he ended up only eating a few bites and I had to give up a big portion of my tofu.  Later that night he started complaining about not feeling well, and ended up getting sick.  He normally has a strong stomach.  So, Yummy Yummy, I will be fair and give you 3 stars strictly for your tofu dishes.  I enjoy my friday nights when my bf and I get take out and watch a movie, but it looks like I will be doing it alone if I want to order from your restaurant again.",

    "text": "Let me say first that I love Chinese food and its hard to not impress me. With that said, this place was gross.  I came in at lunch around 11:00am and was the only person in there. Their lunch menu has a lot but its strange: you get the main food, then you have to choose between a drink OR an egg roll OR a soup. Other places its usually all three for the lunch menu.   I ordered shrimp with garlic sauce and a large hot and sour soup because that's what I really came for and I can seriously put away Chinese food. It took what seemed like at least 10 minutes so I'm starting to think that it will come out fresh and incredible. You can see where they're cooking...looks like they're hard at work back there.  The person who took my order at the register brings the soup first then the plate of food. I hadn't noticed until I got the food but they have buckets of silverware on the table. I wasn't sure if they were used or not, but they looked used. However there were so many on each table that certainly they all couldn't have been used. I was also kind of taken aback that they serve on styrofoam plates. No big deal just that I hadn't seen that in a long time.  I start eating the shrimp with garlic sauce. I quickly find that I don't detect any garcle whatsoever. Maybe because I love garlic and they only put enough in for a normal person. I don't know. I also soon find that it tastes like one of those microwaveable Chinese meals I could have gotten at the store a couple hundred feet away from their frozen section. Ah well, I eat it all anyway.  I get to the hot and sour soup: again, what I had really come for because I had been craving it for some time and has become my measuring stick for Chinese places. First slurp: no flavor. Nothing. Ok? I put some soy sauce. Kind of better. So I'm eating it, watching a little of their TV as I go when I noticed something strange. I don't know if it was uncooked egg or some sort of gellatanous goup but there was some clear junk in the soup. I already paid for it and I got the impression they wouldn't care if I told them, so I scoup it out and put on my plate. I continue eating the soup and find more and more. And what I think was chicken in there starts to resemble children's fingers that may have slipped in. This is no bueno!  Another thing. Their drinks. They give you a styrofoam cup to fill yourself which is cool, but they don't have a lid for that size. Makes me think they purposefully did this so you wouldn't take any drink with you.  I work around here and this could have been my go to place but I won't ever be coming back. It makes my stomach feel weird just thinking about what I ate. I hope I don't get sick later on.  Yes, it could have been a bad day for them. It was Friday maybe they were all excited, I don't know. But I'm not going to chance it.",

    "text": "I want this review to be seen as the best constructive criticism I can give to a place with so much potential. For those of you not familiar with the area, the location of this business is absolutely amazing. Two major crossroads in Scottsdale, great traffic from big stored next door and quite simply, a great little place.  However, keep in mind that people shop with their eyes. That said, when you walk into a business, that first impression makes a huge impact on many things. Let me give you a summary:  When you walk in, you'll see that they have turned the place into a warehouse to keep all of their inventory (drinks, food, plastic cups, napkins, etc...) but instead of having a designated storage room for that, everything is just all over the place (around the tables, vending machine, register, counter, etc...). My advice to the owners/managers is simple. Please keep the place organized, make it look like a place to eat and make people want to sit down and enjoy a nice meal over there. One of the employees was cutting veggies on one of the tables for customers. I really hope they take my review as good feedback and not as bad feedback. They have so much potential, a little organization, clearing up and cleaning up with go insanely far.  The food itself isn't bad at all. Prices are affordable and they have a huge menu, you can pretty much eat anything Chinese that comes to mind there! I've never had an issue with the food, but I always get it to go.",

Seriously the best Chinese I have found in the area and I've lived in this area for almost a decade! I love the fact that they don't drench the sweet and sour chicken and keep the sauce separate, the chicken was super crunchy and not soggy. Egg rolls are huge and super delicious.  I don't know why anyone would leave a bad review, the staff are friendly and the food is flavorful and so yummy!",

Egg roll was pretty good however about halfway through, a glob of pink meat fell out. The meat wasn't identifiable and I lost my appetite. Would not eat here!!",

I'm no expert on the Phoenix/Scottsdale dining scene, as I don't live in Arizona, but I assume one can find better Chinese food in the area, at least during normal dining hours. But as far as run-of-the-mill Chinese takeout goes, this is decidedly above average.",

The delivery people are also always friendly. The food is always tasty, with good portions. Definitely scratches the itch for me and my s/o. Before Yummy Yummy, my rule of thumb was that any restaurant that called itself \"Yummy\" or \"Delicious\" or \"Good\" was none of the above, but Yummy Yummy really breaks that mold.",

Honestly, the inside isn't all that clean and since I genuinely like the food from here I figure let's keep things positive :) In the past I would order dinner items with my family, but then I started switching to the lunch specials, which are a pretty good deal (especially considering how much food you get).   There's probably about 30-40 items to choose from (meat, veggie, noodle, fish, etc...). For the most part it's pretty usual stuff (orange chicken, lo mein, broccoli beef, etc...). I normally get a chicken (orange or honey) or bbq spare ribs (no bone). It's all a little greasy, but good. You get a choice of white, brown, or fried rice. The brown rice is good, and it's usually what I get. The main course and rice are served together in a round plastic carry-out bowl (that's pretty big). Then you get a choice of wonton soup, egg drop soup, egg roll, or soda. I normally get an egg roll. It's pretty greasy, but huge. I've had both the soups as well, and although they taste good, they're pretty broth heavy.   Prices are VERY reasonable for what you get. Depending on your main item meals are $6.49 or $6.99. They're pretty quick with orders and from what I can tell food is made as you order so it's fairly fresh.",

    "text": "I have tried this place twice now. We've had fried rice, crab puffs, coconut shrimp, boneless spare ribs, and orange chicken. Both times my order was delivered well in advance of the promised one hour.  It actually only took about 20 minutes.   The food is great for what it is. It's not A+ quality like a great sit-down Chinese restaurant, but I don't expect that in delivery received in 20 minutes. The spare ribs were great, with just the right amount of fat and no grizzle. The orange chicken was over-breaded but still good, and it came with some fresh, crisp broccoli. The coconut shrimp comes with a really interesting creamy sauce that's a nice change from sweet and sour. I also loved the fried rice with the unusual addition of bean sprouts.   I will mention though, that the first time I ordered, the man who came to give me my delivery, which I had paid for by credit card using the Yelp app, told me \"you pay tip in cash.\" While it goes without saying that I was going to tip him, it bothered me to be told that I have to, and it was worse that he demanded cash. It didn't stop me from ordering from them again though!",

Today, to put it best, they'll ignore certain patrons, however they'll be quick to respond to others. We've waited at their register for a few minutes without being acknowledged by the three people near us. It almost seemed like we were inconveniencing them, yet another young lady comes in and they greet her immediately. I don't want to say it's based on any prejudice, but that they're food is not that great and their service is deplorable. Don't even think about ordering take out.

When I called to place my order, I was a little shocked to find out that all but one of the entrees listed in the \"Vegetable\" dinner section contained some kind of meat or fish product.   So I ordered the only option I had tofu and mixed vegetables in a brown soy sauce, and requested they add cashew nuts.  He informed me that it would be $2, and I said that was fine.  When our food arrived, my dish had no cashew nuts... \"Boo\", it also had no flavor whatsoever \"Ick\".  In fact, after taking a few bites, I began to be concerned about the quality of the food, as it was loaded with veggies and sauce, and really had no flavor at all...something was wrong here.   I ate about 5 bites total and threw it away, I didn't want to risk getting sick over it. Hottie did the same and we ate a few pieces of cheese for dinner instead.  Needless to say we won't be back.",

It was like from the fair!! Omg and the pork friend rice let me tell you.....\" Everything I've ordered from there is amazing, won ton soup, cashew chicken, crab ragoons. yum.  And to the guy who didn't know meat TRADITIONALLY comes in Ma Po Tou Fu, look it up and learn.  This place is as authentic as it gets as far as hole in the wall chinese take out places.  It is not a fine dining restaurant, check your expectations.  Don't eat in.  Get take out.  Free delivery, amazing food, nice sweet little older asian man answering the phones.  Love it. LOVE it.  That is all.  Sorry Chinawok, I'll never go back....  UPdate, had the Ma Po Tou Fu last night, A-MAZING! Loved it, highly recomend it!",

We over ordered and now have plenty of food to enjoy tomorrow. We chose to dine in and we were not unhappy.  I found the owners to be accomodating and friendly, but then I was friendly as well and asking questions that they were only too happy to answer.

I love shrimp and theirs are fairly large, plump,and also cooked just right--I usually pay the $3 for extra shrimp for that reason. We always also order the barbecued ribs (bone-in) because they are fantastic:moist,large,meaty, and not drowned in sauce--easily enough for two or three people to share the large order as an appetizer. We like brown rice and very thin noodles--they provide plenty with whatever entree we choose. (Although for several people,ordering extra for $3 is reasonable.)  When they code an item as spicy, believe them,although you can ask them to lighten that up, I think. But you run the chance of losing some of the flavor for those dishes,if you do, and there are plenty of other options.  I always have ordered from their online menu and have them deliver, and they are very prompt; food is always hot--and their deliveryman is very polite, and the tiny extra charge for delivery means you can easily afford to tip him too.(And I do recommend tipping for deliveries--it takes time, work,and extra packaging, in addition to getting the food to you while it's hot.And their prices are very reasonable for the amount and quality you receive.",

    "text": "Yummy yummy, waste of money. We should have trusted Yelp but were swayed by positive reviews on Google and Yummy's delivery order app. Delivery was promised in a 45-60 minute window, and we waited 80 minutes before calling the restaurant to find out what was up. A curt response told us the food was already out for delivery, which made its arrival 7 minutes later a bit suspicious given that's exactly how far my house is from the restaurant. I'm pretty sure it had been sitting under a heat lamp for a bit because the crab puffs, which would have been tasty, were so rubbery we couldn't bite through them. The House Lo Mein was cold and dry, and the General Tso's chicken had gotten soggy, despite the overall stinginess of sauce. The Beef and Broccoli left a lot to be desired, with a gelatinous sauce and tough, thin, shavings of beef. And so the rigorous search for decent Chinese food continues.",

The food is only $6 to $14 with most items only $8  sheesh. ..cheap enough food that tastes alot better than other Scottsdale Chinese takeouts. I had there $6.95 orange chicken , fried rice and egg roll special.   The food took a bit to get but when it arrived it was hot and fresh.  The service is not great but what can one expect for $6.95. The food made up for it. I am certainly coming back for more bad service and good tasty Chinese food...to me it was worth my $6.95. Lol",

Although the ambience is far from delightful it makes a nice in and out place for take out on the way home and the service ,although lacking in the friendliness category, is quite fast. The first time I ordered here it did not make a memorable impression but while craving Chinese I gave it another shot, that and it's just so darn convenient. I have found something I like and stick to that, chicken and broccoli and crab Rangoon..  I've had better crab puffs butt I've also had worse, they are a little sweet but the ratio is perfect. The chicken and broccoli is a little to saucy but no bad enough to make me never come back and the broccoli is always cooked perfectly. Egg rolls are sub par. I don't even bother with them anymore.   Bottom line Decent take out, not bad enough to never go back but I will be far from loyal if another new decently priced place in the area opens up.",

Dry hush puppy looking things next to rice with a big styrofoam dish of sweet & sour sauce on the side. WTF? Don't they know that S & S is an American Chinese dish and requires particular ingredients? For the record, I was simply told: \"this how we serve this\". And the Chicken teriyaki? God awful chunks of gristly dark meat, some with skin, swimming in a watered down sauce of some sort? Thank God the egg rolls were edible, as I had not eaten all day. And NOT cheap. Crab Rangoon? How do you screw this up, well, I'll tell you. You put 1/8th of a teaspoon of cream cheese in a wonton wrapper and fold it into one large triangle and soak it in grease. What ever happened to those cute little twisted bird's nest looking things that actually had filling you could taste. Yep, in the trash they went. Never, ever, ever again.

We ordered the mu-shu pork which is one of my personal faves, fried dumplings, fried pork rolls, thai panang curry with beef and the chicken and broccoli with some won ton soup.  Here's the low-down: Mu-Shu Pork: Very disappointed.  The flavor was slightly fake in nature and had a strange/not good aftertaste.  It was also missing the sweet sauce it usually comes with that makes it delectable. Fried Dumplings: Were very tasty, but the dough was VERY thick.  I felt my arteries closing while eating them. Fried Pork Roll: Also very tasty, but VERY greasy.  You can tell you're eating something fried. Thai Panang Curry with beef: Very tasty, BF gobbled it up without much communication.  It wasn't exactly the flavor he was looking for, wanting more of the curry flavor, but it was good enough for him to finish it in record time. Chicken and broccoli: The chicken tastes fake with that chewy consistency that most chinese places boast in their \"chicken\" dishes making me wonder whether I'm eating chicken...or some other white meat...the broccoli was fresh and crisp even if it was doused in too much sauce. Won Ton Soup: Had plenty in my time and this was just wrong. It tasted as if they made it with butter, which turned me off instantly. Otherwise a pretty uninspiring meal.  Ended up throwing most of it away.  2 stars for the 2 dishes that were ok.",

The \"vegetable\" selection on the menu at this steamtable type (It looked like it was set up for steamtable service  but all of the steam trays were empty when I went in today) restaurant is very small, but Ma Po Tofu is generally a safe bet.  I ordered it to go, took it home and began digging into it without really examining it.  I noticed some lumpy stuff, but just thought it to be clumps of rice and kept eating.  The sauce was flavorful, I was starving...and then my girlfriend asked if I was eating meat.  I realized then that the lumpy stuff was not clumps of rice or some other non-meat thing but rather some kind of unidentifiable meat.  I have never seen a non-vegetarian Ma Po Tofu before -- a dish that generally screams \"vegetarian.\"  Needless to say, I stopped eating immediately.  Unfortunately, I had consumed a good amount of food before realizing that it had meat in it.  Now it's time to settle back and hope that sickness doesn't come.  I did have a spoonful of their \"vegetable\" fried rice.  That was not very flavorful at all.  ***NOTE:  Noodles Ranch (Vietnamese) is right next door to this place.  It is very vegetarian friendly and has excellent food and ambiance.  Unfortunately they were closed this afternoon, so I could not go there.",

There are so many eating options here as so many new food chains are opening up...  We decided to get Take Out from Yummy Yummy due to a busy evening  Upon walking in, the inside actually isn't bad... very basic layout, nothing flashy... The employees were all very friendly They have a pretty big menu but I had noticed that they had an Orange Chicken special which came with rice and a egg roll for about $6 so I chose that I also got a Dr pepper can Came out to a decent price The food took about 15 minutes to get ready which was pretty quick  They were nice enough to double bag it and toss in some soy sauce, hot sauce, and napkins... Oh and fortune cookies...  Getting home, I was sort of hoping to see the cool little red/white boxes that Chinese food usually comes in but they were in a cool black plastic container It smelt really good and I was looking forward to the taste Pretty good The brown rice is good The orange chicken is very flavorful and cooked well The eggroll was a little dry but the sauces came in handy  All in all I was pretty impressed and happy to have had a good Chinese food experience at Yummy Yummy I will recommend it to any one looking for affordable take out Not as bad as some reviews make it seem   :)",

The lady that took our order was rude, she texted on her phone while she took our order, we had to ask where the utensils were, and as we ate the poorly cooked dog they mopped (Normally not a big deal) except it stunk of bleach. Man I'm not sure what people in this part of the state consider good Chinese food, but it's sure as fuck not this dumpster. You'll get better Chinese at your kids school cafeteria.",

Once my food arrived it was lukewarm at best, leading me to believe it spent quite some time sitting somewhere. The hot and sour soup once heated was good, the Pad Thai was not; very slimy. My boyfriend ordered general tsos chicken, which was good and good portion. All in all, I'll go somewhere else for Chinese food.",

    "text": "If you're looking for a place for good bad chinese-- you know what I mean, greasy and not at all good for you-- then this is a good place!  My boyfriend and I have lived in Old Town for 2 years and had yet to find a decent delivery chinese place.  I'd actually ordered from Yummy Yummy over a year ago and was not impressed.  But, either it's hit or miss, or their \"new management\" actually has improved things.  I tend to order a lot of fried, filled foods when I order chinese, and this place did it right!  I had crab rangoon, pork filled wontons, and an eggroll, and all were fantastic!  The eggroll was gigantic and very crisp, and the rangoon and wontons were crisp with a good amount of filling.  Usually when I order these things, the rangoon is soft and mushy, and the wontons are mostly breading.  So, I was excited that this was not the case.    My sesame chicken tasted like every other order of sesame chicken I've ever had.  I was not a fan of the fried rice that accompanied it.  It tasted kind of like I would expect feet to taste.  My boyfriend had chicken chow mein and orange chicken with the sauce on the side, and he was a fan of both.  Service was accurate and prompt, although, I asked for \"lots\" of sweet and sour sauce, and they gave me one small container of it, no more than they normally give.  In conclusion, will I go here when I want a gourmet dinner?  No.  But, will I crave this when I'm hungover and don't want to leave my apartment on a Sunday evening?  Absolutely!  I am happy to have an alternative to pizza when I want delivery food.",

The wontons were cold and bland tasting. I'm guessing their food is much better eaten in-house. They did however provide me with four fortune cookies, which now have me wondering what my future really holds.  I think this is located next to Noodle Ranch which gets glowing reviews for ultra fresh asian food.",

Got delivery from here one afternoon for dinner and I could not believe how fast it came.(Less than half an hour) Ordered the crab puffs/rangoons, pad thai, coconut chicken, and orange beef with white rice. Everything came hot, fresh and delicious.   The crab puffs were crispy with a good amount of filling and great flavor (goes great with sweet and sour sauce); the pad thai tasted good but lacked a little in the complexity of flavor that I'm used to with that particular dish but the textures were spot on. I absolutely loved the sauces on the chicken and beef, although the orange sauce could stand to have a bit of spice. The batter on both dishes wasn't soggy and was still light and fluffy.   As to the meat vs batter ratio I've been seeing some of the reviews complain about, I didn't see what they were talking about, the amount of meat compared to the batter was about average for that sort of batter. As for the portion sizes, they're larger than what I'm used to when getting take-out Chinese (Think 2-3 portions from Panda Express per single entree plate) so the price is pretty spot on considering what you're getting. Giving this 4/5 because I loved just about everything about it (almost comparable to China town take-out)",

    "text": "Chinese take-out is trial and error. In this case, Yummy Yummy was exactly that - trial and error.   Our first time with a Scottsdale Chinese takeout, my wife and I tried a sampling of less-expensive and more-expensive menu selections, thinking we'd have leftovers for the next day. Won tons in won ton soup were overly large and doughy - threw it out. Egg drop soup was tasteless - threw it out. Duck was good, but fatty; ate around the fat. Chicken with vegetables was okay - very mediocre. \"House-special\" fried rice was okay - but nothing special; not worth the extra cost.   Total cost: $50.00 for two with some leftovers for a third meal the next day. Not a good value nor a pleasant eating experience.  We'll be trying another establishment next time.",

    "text": "Let me paint you a picture. It's getting kind of late. You have a choice, you could go to the gym, make a healthy meal, shower, and feel pretty good about yourself... or you could throw on some baggy clothes, boot up netflix, and order Yummy Yummy. I chose the latter. I choose the latter quite a bit. I am simultaneously amazed at the combination of both the ever so slightly better than mediocre chinese that I am given and the superhuman-like ability of the delivery man to macgyver his way into whatever passcode protected apartment complex I choose to have him deliver to. Likewise I am grateful for his speedy judgement-free exit once the necessary I take food, you take money exchange is complete... Though they always give me silverware for two...   Overall I find each Yummy Yummy experience one that satisfies my needs for fast, unhealthy american-style chinese that is brought to me no matter the obstacle.",

I got shrimp in lobster sauce, biggest shrimp I have seen and perfectly cooked, brown rice was done correctly, the flavors were wonderful!   Hubby got general tsos chicken, he was very satisfied,  heat was just right and the pork fried rice was very tasty.",
