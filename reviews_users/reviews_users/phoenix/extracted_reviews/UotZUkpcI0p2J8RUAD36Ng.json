The first course was bad but the second course was worse. Especially since we were never served the second course cocktail pairing. We expressed our concern to both our server and the manager who by the made no effort to come over and apologize to our table. Needless to say we won't be back.",

From the servers' elegant outfits to the carefully selected decor to the classic chairs and benches, 2nd Story LB is out of the movies we watch and wish we were in.    I took my mom and brother here for a special occasion and that it was.  The food was memorable, succulent, and served in perfect unison with the menu description.  The drink menu was typical for a place aiming at mixology drinks but nonetheless excelled in taste.  I ordered a Diablo something and beyond the taste even the glass was classy.    Our server Brittany was unstoppably attentive, humorous, and A+ all around.    They need to work on dimming the lighting a bit but otherwise the mood is perfect for a date spot.  Last thing I'll say is it twas a shame that some putzes showed up wearing shorts and t-shirts looking like casual tourists. Though they were perfectly accepted by the staff, this place is a classy joint...so if you go then at least have fun and dress up a bit more than being in your family room on Sunday watching the football game and enjoy the cool elegance of something wonderful.  Looking forward to seeing this place thrive.",

Went here based on the Yelp reviews and it really wasn't our thing. Wonderful whiskey selection. Great suggestion by the waitress when I told her I like single malt Scotch with little to no peat. She offered something I had never had and I thoroughly enjoyed it. We sat on the patio which was LOUD. The street is right there and the cars going by made conversation a little difficult (as did the table of drunk ladies). The decor was beautiful. Very 1920's inspired and well done, not tacky. We did not eat anything because the prices are very high. Even the appetizers were pricey. If we were planning a \"nice\" night out, I could see coming here again, ordering food and not being put off by the $19 neat Scotch, but as it stood, it was not what we were expecting.",

Nice touch and something I haven't seen. It's a very small space so be sure to make reservations, but book online, don't call. I made a reservation over the phone for a friend's birthday. When we arrived, there was no reservation. They were very polite, apologized and got us seated. Overall, it was a great experience and I would love to go back.",

    "text": "Few restaurants are good or bad enough for me to write a review.  Me and the lady went here to kick off restaurant week. The restaurant week menu looked fantastic, so I was pretty excited.  The first course, the lady got the beet forms. A regular menu item for them, and is a small salad of sorts. The presentation was very pretty. The beets were in little cubes, there was some sweet cream drops, some greenery flat on the plate, very pretty, very tasty. The course was served with a corpse reviver that was very tasty.  I got the sweetbreads. I really hope they put these on their regular menu, because I would slap my own mother if she got in the way of these. And I love my mother. The sweetbreads were nice and thick, a little crispy, and came with some greenery and some green puree that I'm not sure what was exactly, but the plate was clean when they came to take This came with a New England Mule. Essentially, a moscow mule but with rum. Flor de Cana gold rum. A good choice.  For the second course, the lady got the scallops. They were sizable and incredibly tender. No rubber texture and not sandy or gritty at all. They were as scallops should be. This came with a gin fizz. How can you mess up a gin fizz? They didn't let me know.  I got the Chicken Gelantine stuffed with some duck mixture, and sided by some thinly sliced cauliflower and a cauliflower puree. The chicken was tasty and seasoned well, but the star was so obviously that duck mixture that the chicken was stuffed with. It was so fantastic. This came with some drink called Blueberry Cobbler. Not a drink, just by the name, that I would normally order. I'm more of a Manhattan/Old Fashioned sort of person. But the drink was, somehow, not too sweet, and was pretty pleasant. I probably wouldn't order it, only because they also have some great strong cocktails.  Course #3: The lady got the veal chop served with a mint julep. The veal was cooked very nicely. Still pink and just warm center, and it was all sorts of baby beef goodness.  I got the foie gras (not sure why anyone would pass on that...) and it was very nicely prepared. The foie was a substantial size, and had a nice carmelization on top. I think this was their attempt to outdo the sweetbreads. It was very close. This came with one of my favorite cocktails, the Sazerac. They used Templeton Rye for it, which I was a little anxious about, but it turned out very well.   We sat outside, so I can not attest to the atmosphere very much. The service was good. Our first drinks came out a little after the first course, but that is okay. We took a look at their regular menu before we left, and we will definitely be back.  Especially if they put those sweetbreads on the menu. A little pricey, but not for the area.",

Be prepared to wait a minute for drinks, but it's because they are tailored, yummy cocktails.  If you're in despo' need for a quick drink order a beer in the meantime.  Their food is so tasty also!  We've never been disappointed by any order there.  Stop by for their HH - you cannot beat it.

It was very fresh and I especially enjoyed the gnocchi and sauces that came on the dish. Another huge plus was that the dishes all came very well plated. It definitely takes the experience another level up.  Since their menu changes regularly, I'm going to spare going into more detail about the food. Tdlr is that it was really good and worth the price.

It tasted like it barely had a shot in it.  $18 for fondue and few pieces of bread, crackers and apple slices.  The crackers were seriously hard.  The fondue itself was tasty.",

    "text": "While this was not, in fact, a typical \"speakeasy,\"  the drinks certainly lived up to the billing!  WOW!  Tried four different bespoke (menu bespoke) and my wife had one and a straight Whiskey.   All were PERFECT and delicious.  What's Up Doc was the biggest surprise.  Carrot juice and bourbon!?!?   It works!  In a great way.  And the Rye So Serious? Is another mystifying winner.  Like a chocolate-Orange  hard candy.  SO good.  Sazarac and Manhattan were perfect and exactly as requested.   Food was excellent.  Opted for lighter fare and were rewarded beautifully.  Seasonal (cold weather fried clam and corn chowder) was so good. And rabbit tamales are a MUST.  They do run out, so be prepared if that happens.    Service was impeccable.  Jodi took amazingly good care of us and I hope she is your server.  Ask for her if not.  She knows the menu, likes good drinks and is absolutely delightful.  Management is extremely interested in your having a great experience and we so appreciated that, too.  Well done.    Note:  outdoor patio seating is cute and comfortable, BUT, street traffic was obnoxious.  Loud Harley's  and (gas powered?) golf carts were a distraction.  Not a deal-breaker, but if you can score an indoor seat, it's preferable.  If not, the outdoor deal really is comfortable and cute.   Enjoy.  And, cheers!",

My girlfriends and I came here for a birthday and we experienced AMAZING service. I ordered the conquistador (a little strong for my weak taste buds but still good) and my girl friends all ordered the \"every rose has its thorn\" drink, which I later switched to.   Everything we ordered was delicious and if my memory serves me correctly, we had a really great lobster mushroom/veggie started plate.   Both dinner and drinks were 5/5. What really put this experience over the top for me was that (one of) the owner(s) sat down with us, granted he knew the birthday girl. But he sat and chatted with us and dined with us- such a sweet heart. Even better, we had the opportunity to meet the chef who was the mastermind behind all of the dishes, he spoke to how he hand selects all the ingredients and picks everything as locally as possible. You could really tell he cared about what ended up on the plate in front of you.",

Jodi was our attentive and friendly server, bringing Ellen their Bee's Knees cocktail and me a fine Manhattan. Later we ordered the creative and delicious fry bread sliders with chorizo, something we'd eagerly have again.   As we were winding down the happy hour, Jordan, the executive chef came to our table and asked if we'd like to try an experimental new dessert, The Elvis. He described it as a small pastry sandwich made with thin layers of banana bread, peanut butter, and jam covered with dark chocolate, accompanied by three banana fritters with cinnamon batter. Of course, we said, \"Yes!\" The Elvis arrived as a beautiful presentation on a small serving board, with fresh berries artistically cut in half.   Later, Jordan came by to ask what we thought of it, and we gave him four thumbs up! He topped off our happy hour with an especially happy finish. Shortly before we left, Tommy, the owner, stopped by to greet us and to ask for feedback. We basically said what's in this review!   The setting is cozy and comfortable, with tasteful lighting and pleasing decor. We give the place our highest recommendation, now being one of our favorite places in Scottsdale!",

The menu was expansive. The whiskey/bourbon selection was especially good. I decided to go with a classic, the old fashioned. I selected what spirit I wanted in it and it came out perfect. Some places put too many unnecessary items in this cocktail but not here. It was made perfectly and tasted amazing.  Wife got the Every Rose Has it's Thorn and the presentation was solid and she loved the taste.  This is a great place to go after dinner to grab a drink and relax.",

    "text": "The opening of this hot new restaurant has been a long time coming...   I've seen the stairs leading up from Gelato Spot in Old Town for well over a year now, and heard the \"Cliff Notes\" version of the story for SSLB since before I noticed those stairs!  I attended a soft opening at SSLB on Thursday night and I walked away a little buzzed, with a full belly, and pleasantly surprised by the quality of the food.  It's obvious that Tommy P, owner of both Gelato Spot and SSLB, has put blood, sweat and tears into making his latest concept come to fruition.  He's put a marvelous team in place, and it's no secret that he and his staff have paid close attention to detail in everything from the design and flow of the space, the prohibition-esque atmosphere, unique hand-crafted cocktail list, creative cuisine, etc...  My group enjoyed a variety of the cocktails on the menu... I didn't see anything with vodka (my go-to), so I opted for the \"high & tight,\" a champagne cocktail made with lunetta prosecco, house bitters & sugar cubes, flamed orange peel.  It went down easy!  I get the feeling that this is the kind of place that you can just tell the bartender what you like and have him surprise you.  We also had a tasting of five different menu items.  I highly recommend the Asian Chopped Salad, the Lamb Chops, and the Scallops.  And in looking at the menu, I already know what I'll be ordering on a future visit:  the Chilean Sea Bass and the 24 hr Braised Beef Short Ribs.  If those two entrees are as fabulous as they sound in the description, I'll definitely be bumping up my review to a full five stars.  Our server was well-informed on everything we ate and gave us detailed explanations along with each course.  We somehow ended up without dessert, but the beautiful thing about this place? It's literally right upstairs from Gelato Spot, so save some room for the perfect sweet ending to the story aka your experience.  Second Story Liquor Bar will be another great addition to the Old Town dining scene... open for happy hour, dinner, and late night daily, I'll be adding it into my rotation for sure (at least for happy hour and dinner, as I rarely do late night anymore!)",

    "text": "We (me and my wife) went here, lured by the \"Liquor Bar\" in the title. We wanted a quiet bar to get a couple of drinks. Food wasn't what we were looking for.  The staff told us that the place had only been open a week as we went in. A lot of time was spent telling us how great the drinks and food is, but it took a while to actually get the drinks.  It was ok - If you are looking for food I suspect it will be very good - the food sounded great but we were not hungry.   The location is excellent, outside on the veranda looking over the street.   The staff were very friendly and well presented (I had to remember to look at the face).  So my advice to the staff is -- Relax, get a drink in the hands of your customers quickly, and find out if people want food before pushing it. With a name like a 'Liquor Bar' you probably get many customers just looking for drinks. You have an excellent location and good drinks and probably good food. Also turn the music down. A quiet bar encourages conversation which makes for a great bar.  I'll probably be back next time I visit but I'll be sure to let them know I don't want food early if I don't want food.",

For a casual dinner (we were dressed up but this wasn't date night or anthing) this place was overkill but the data on yelp seemed to be a fit. The Yelp data needs correction. This is not a $$ restaurant. This is at lease a $$$. They have several courses for their meals and the owner advised their proteins are flown in fresh so that would also influence the price.   The waitress was very accomodating but the hostess was pretty stuffy (I understand the hostess was replaced so that is a good thing.) I am not frugal. I just do not typically dine at these places because I don't need 4-5 course meals or high-end proteins on average days. After looking over the menu I realized yelp's mistake, paid for my drink and went a few doors down the street.   I understand The 2nd Story Liquor Bar has happy hour and late night drink specials so that helps. I didn't have a perfect experience but what I did experience but I understand some things were corrected since my visit.   I probably would have stayed and enjoyed it if the 2nd Story had some lower cost alternatives on the menu for average nights.",

She is a credit to the hiring practices and to her entire generation.  Three cheers for Bethany!!",

I've been here a few times and it's always been nothing short of wonderful. The last time I was there for dinner, I decided to get a small plate and ended up having the most incredible butternut squash soup. The atmosphere is really cool (maybe a little too dark) and it's also fun sitting at the tiny bar and chatting with the bartenders. The only downside is needing a reservation if you're planning to eat dinner on Friday or Saturday.",

Can't talk about the food since we went here just for drinks and man- they were right up my alley. Classic and strong. Well, I guess \"strong\" is a strong word... they highlighted the taste of each spirit and didn't mask it with sugar and a bunch of mumbo-jumbo. True speakeasy style. The decor is beautiful and the the ambiance continues with the theme.   If I had to complain about anything it would be the cliche outfits. The girls all wear flapper dresses with pearls and the guys were undone bow ties. You can still pull off the style without going all Disneyland. Also, I'm sad you can't see the outside very well from the inside. The have a couple tables outside with a view but seating is very limited. I wish they would have put bigger windows vs tiny ones.   Regardless of those minor style things I will be back for more drinks and I hope to try the food. It looks amazing!",

Picked the goat appy. But no goat so they subbed chorizo. I had fish tacos, except out of halibut so subbed in shrimp. Very average food with an above average price. Wife had chicken. It was very good except the biscuit was raw in middle. Not sure how that could happen, but had to ask 2 people to get our server to come back. A \"business partner\" eventually came by and said he could do nothing about this meal but offered his card so he could \" take care of us\" next time. Not sure what that meant but we declined. There are so many great restaurants in Scottsdale why would we ever go back. Do yourself a favor and try one of the 50 better places in Scottsdale.",

My boyfriend and I both had a beautiful hand crafted cocktail, neither of which, do I remember the name of, but they were both delicious. Mine was made with a housemade pineapple syrup! Do it! He had one served straight up and with champagne. I stole a sip when he went to bathroom. Delicious, but mine was better. The duck I had was cooked to perfection! The presentation was stunning. Every delectable and beautiful morsel on that plate had a delicious and esthetic purpose. The bf's hanger steak was just as beautiful. I will be back before the next birthday....",

    "text": "OK, here goes. Had I written this review after my first experience I would have given it a 5 PLUS star rating. Unfortunately the second time was not up to the first. I will start by saying that we had a reservation. When we arrived 3 or our party of 4 were there and our 4th was stuck in traffic. The hostess said we could not be seated until the 4th was present. OK, reasonable! We then said then we will go up to the bar and wait for him......NO, you cant do that. OK, then just take us to our table, that was reserved, and we will get started on appetizers and drinks. Hmmmm, sorry that doesnt work! After a bit of back and fourth the hostesses agreed to escort us to our table. When we arrived to the \"second story\" there was barely a table occupied and the bar was available.  Seriously, what was the problem. Not only was the restaurant not full, tables remained unoccupied for our entire dinner.  As we sat outside trying to figure out why we couldnt be seated we assumed that the restaurant must be packed and the kitchen backed up and they were surely stalling us. NOT the case. Very strange and was not the best start to our evening. Keep in mind we had talked this place up based on our first experience.   OK, now for the service and the food. Service, outside of the incompetent hostesses, was BEYOND exceptional! Knowledgeable. friendly, understood the food and were confidant making recommendations. The food this time around was good, just not the great food we had the first time around. I couldnt wait to have the charcuterie board again, as it was one of the best we had ever had. It was still good, but was certainly less plentiful and the quality of the ingredients was not what I was promising our friends to be AMAZING. I had the short ribs and somehow I believe the chef completely neglected to salt the meat at all, which made for a disappointing dinner. Fortunately two people had the duck and loved it. Overall the meal was good, but the experience as a whole was a bit disappointing.   All said I will give Second Story Liquor Bar another chance because there really isnt anything else like this place in Scottsdale!",

    "text": "We celebrated our 17th anniversary here. It was WONDERFUL. We both agreed it was an awesome experience. The hostess is at the street level but you get to walk through a mini wine cellar looking area up a flight of stairs to the restaurant, which is on the second story. Aptly named. We were seated in a booth in a quiet corner of the restaurant; very intimate setting. We had our little nook to look out from, and felt nestled in and comfortable.   The decor is fabulous - it seems like they are going for a sassy contemporary vintage; chandelier, dark material on booths, large paintings, lanterns at the table. Feels like an old school lounge on one hand. But then there are contemporary surprises and that's the genius of this place - it doesn't feel dated, it feels reimagined. The music was a perfect compliment to the decor; songs like \"it ain't got that swing\" remixed with a more contemporary beat. Loved it.   My husband got a whiskey flight. It was pricy, there's no way around it. $40 but it was so worth it. The cheapest whiskey flight it $25. He's been wanting to try a whiskey flight and he had the Japanese one. Loved it. I, on the other hand, had a glass of a brut rose which was lovely. I am a sucker for sparkles.   There's nothing straight up vegan on the menu but this is exactly what I love about going to a restaurant with a talented chef. The waitress said he could whip me up something and he sure did. By far the best vegan dish I've had out in a long time. It was spaghetti squash with veggies and marinara. I've NEVER liked spaghetti squash like this before. There was also asparagus, onions, zucchini, tomato - it was wonderful. Truly. The sauce had a flavor that I can't identify and was out of the world. The chef also thought about texture and threw some pepitas on for some crunch. Ya, I'm waaaaaaaaay happy and ate the entire thing.  Being my complete opposite, my husband got the burger that had three different meats, a house pickle, and cheese with French fries. He said it was the top #1 or #2 burger he's had in his entire life. That's no small compliment.   We will be back. Not your everyday dinner unless you've got the spare cash, but absolutely worth a visit for something special.   We both want to come again sometime!",

You can sit at the bar inside (which is actually quite nice); or, if your lucky, you can score a table outside on the 2nd story patio.  They have a happy hour that ends at 5:30 (at least when I have been there), so might want to head in before then to take advantage of the lower pricing.  I still have not tried the food, but it looks and sounds very good. They are one of the few places in town that serve Marrow.   Next time I will give it a try and report back for Ya'all!   In the meantime I recommend checking them out for yourselves.  I don't think anyone will be disappointed.",

Unfortunately I don't think it's available anymore or it's just for special occasions. Either way I wish it was always available cause I love tasting Menus for foods and drinks.   I also came here for restaurant week this year and that's really why I am writing this review. So approximately a month after I dined here I received a credit card transaction which I know could not have possibly occurred on that date so I called and left a voicemail. I waited a week and when I realized they had no intentions to call me back, I called again and the person on the phone was very courteous and explained the situation. Turns out that there was a system glitch that delayed the tip amount from that night to post. So at this point I'm already annoyed that a charge went through at a later date but what I'm really pissed about is that they never even called me back to clarify the issue even though I left a voicemail !!

The menu was limited, the place has a cool vibe when you walk in (dark wood/leather) and the deck is nice to people watch below. Unfortunately the menu was real slim and desert was not on the menu. We ordered French fries. Over Cooked and greasy. Update-manage contacted me after my review and apologized for the fries and agreed to look at adding desert to the menu that puts them at 1/2 stars",

The staff were friendly and I love, love, love the decor and setting. I had never had bourbon before so I decided to try an Old Fashioned and realized I've been missing out! My friend and I shared the charcuterie plate and biscuits which were both delicious. She then had the fish and I tried the meatballs which were flavorful and beautifully presented. And definitely don't skip dessert because it was just as good. Our server was great and very attentive and even came by right before happy hour ended to see if we wanted anything else. Definitely go for yourself because describing just doesn't do it justice. This is right above The Gelato Spot which would make a great pairing for a boozy gelato shake.....",

I especially love the ambiance - it's dimly lit that adds to the intimate feel of a speakeasy and the bar is one of the best in the country. What truly makes Second Story phenomenal and a place I visit every time I'm in town are the people that define the overall excellence. I'd like to give a huge shout-out to Alli, Jake and Lori!! Cheers and see you all again soon.",

    "text": "Well where do you start? First please ignore the grammar | spelling - I'm speeding through this on my phone....  I've been frequenting this Whiskey influencediiilliiiili Restaurant for the past two years and always feel content and joyful after my experience. The New chef has just released his first menu and he l picked up the \"Rock\" show casing his talents during Arizona Restaurant Week w a 3 course fixed menu. Two choices in each setting!   C1-The Beef Tartar was plentiful and delighting starter plate. Balanced, with acidity, salt and (vinegar or Horseradish) and I selected the Jeffersons Ocean Aged Whiskey - this is a \"Must Have\" if you enjoy unique and amazing American whiskey's C2- I went w/ the obvious choice a 5 spice crepe filled with Pork Belly and truffle oil- such a typical heavy course but the crepe and sauces dressed the dish amazingly well. I heard that C2 option #1 the Ravioli is extremely on point as well. C3- I didn't go with the I obvious first choice the \"Charred Hanger Steak.\" Instead I did the Double Fried Chicken and Crumpet with Bourbon (yes, bourbon) maple syrup!!!! This is total play on Chicken and Waffles- yet refined and delighting, hearty and filling, sweet and a hint of tang!! I paired this with the Berheim Wheated Whiskey / 90 proof / with hints of butterscotch- Toffee- cinnamon and white pepper  Can't wait to see the new menu release this up coming week  Oh and the cocktail selection?  It's amazing! Flanked left to right, ceiling to the floor with over 100 whiskeys and an array amount of the others to play the beat of anyone's palate! Oh, when I said whiskey, John \"The Whiskey Man\" Christie will lead you to promised land when exploring any whisky (ey) from the main land across the Atlantic to Scotland & Ireland. Don't forget that to get your Orient Whiskey fix too!!  My favorites in no order just a biased opinion below   From across the pond - Jameson \"Caskmates\" Irish Whiskey  Aberlour (any) Powers Gold Green Spot  Japanese  Nikki Coffee Pot (just try it - yummmm) Hibiki   American Jefferson (any) Knob Creek Rye (my dram of choice) Elijah Craig 23 Old GRANDAD OGD!!!  ***Don't judge it's the best value bar none",

    "text": "My husband and I were in Scottsdale for a long weekend with another couple and we were looking for somewhere good to go eat on Saturday night.  We found Second Story Liquor Bar on Yelp....and the high reviews couldn't have been more right!  When we walked up the stairs to the restaurant we were immediately struck by the decor and ambience.  It felt like a 1920's speakeasy.  Even the wait staff were wearing dresses that would have fit in during that era. Every detail seemed to have been considered!  And then the food.....OH.MY.GOD.  It was AMAZING.  We decided to do a bit of grazing and share several small plates and a couple of entrees so that we could try more items off the menu.  We started with the Twice Baked Croquettes and the Burrata Caprese.  My mouth just started watering again when I typed those names.  The croquettes were perfectly cooked, filled with ham and manchego and with an amazing creme fraiche on the side.  The burrata.....oh, the burrata!  The cheese was silken and delicious, the tomatoes were fresh, the balsamic glaze was perfection, and the bread was so good that we raved about it to the owner!  I've never had simple bread taste so good before.    We continued with the Chef's Board (yum!) and then two of the Pork Belly Sausage Pasta (really unique and delish).  We finished with the Rum Cake and we were fighting over who got the last bite of the cake and the accompanying espresso whipped cream.  SO GOOD!    On top of all that, the drinks were on point.  Seriously, you cannot go wrong going to SSLB!",

The only reason I'm Not giving it 5 stars because the service we had was eh... Not horrible but not fantastic. She seemed knowledgeable on some stuff but on other stuff like our order or which flight was which..... Not so much. I do wish they would change the music up, we went last time on a Friday night but the music was very tranquil like a spa? It just didn't make sense. I love the concept and the detail of the bar and I look forward to trying them again and actually ordering food next time because the food smelled amazing!  It would be a great place to take a date, or co workers or impress an out of town visitor. I don't believe it's kid friendly nor handicap friendly as you do walk up a flight of stairs. Enjoy!",

    "text": "My first and, so far, only visit to this place was a real treat. I was taken here by my boyfriend for a celebratory, indulgent dinner, since I had had graduated in December from ASU. It was a Thursday night, but we made a reservation anyway - just in case. We had never been here before and didn't know what to expect.   Even at 7pm on a Thursday we were one of maybe 3 occupied tables. Im not sure if it was the cold weather or a weekday but we were some of the only people there that night. I didn't mind; I appreciated that it was quiet and calm. The introvert in me was just so pleased! The venue was small but very classy and upscale looking. I was happy that we had picked such a cozy smaller upscale dining experience.   We were absorbed in the drink menu! There were so many things I wanted to try. I'm a mule fan and read good things about them here, but decided on a champ cocktail instead; we were celebrating after all. My bf ended up getting a mule which was very tasty. My French 75 was perfect - citrus-y, sweet with the tang of gin, just lovely.   For food we started with a mushroom flatbread. I'm a fan of mushrooms so I thought it was amazing! Savory, a little sweet, yummy cheese and crisp bread. The truffle oil was a really nice touch. I would have eaten another one of those for my dinner. But they had scallops. Scallops are my favorite thing to order at a nicer place because scallops are either amazing, or not. And nice places make amazing scallops. I was not disappointed! They were to die for. Nothing beats really good scallops for me and I was in heaven!    Overall it was a lovely night. We had an intimate, quiet, absolutely delicious dinner, and the service was attentive, but gave us space. The only downside was there was only one desert offered, and it just didn't spark my interest (luckily Gelato Spot is just downstairs). I loved it and would definitely be back to indulge some more and try other dishes that sounded just as good.",

Well I just went home and turned on Fargo and decided I would just order delivery from somewhere.  I went with UberEATS tonight and to my very happy surprise I noticed I could order food from Second Story Liquor Bar.  I ordered and received my food in less than 30 minutes.  Everything was prefect and I highly recommend ordering delivery from there when you are too lazy to go out but also too picky to eat crappy food lol",

    "text": "I'm so glad we found this place on Yelp! I knew we were going to be staying a night in Old Town and was looking for a place close to the hotel that had foie gras on the menu (I live in CA where it's illegal...wth?) and I found this place. My boyfriend has never tried it before and was looking forward to seeing what the fuss was about. When we got there it was almost empty, but that's probably because someone is literally trying to cook AZ this time of year and no one wants to go out when it's 150 degrees.   It's a pretty small space but it's decorated nicely and the waitresses all wear these black lace dresses and have on red lipstick. It seemed very Robert Palmeresque, which is fine by me. Our waitress was very informative and told us this was actually a , whiskey tasting bar...I could see my boyfriends face light up when she said that. She also informed us that they were going to be changing the menu and the chef's were doing some sort of chef's whim appetizer where you don't know what you're going to get. Sounds good to me! We ordered the foie gras....they were out!!! Oh no, this is what we came for! Oh well, we ordered the chef's whim and a flight of whiskey's to try. We also ordered a cocktail that was their take on a whiskey sour.   Our surprise app was swordfish, but it wasn't just swordfish, it was the best swordfish either of us have ever had! I don't know what all they did to it because it was their whim and it wasn't described on the menu...all I can say about that is trust the chef! If they do that whim thing again and you're there, get it! We loved the cocktail and our favorite whiskey was the Maker's Mark 46.   We were going to order another app when our waitress informed us that the chef found a 2 oz. serving of foie gras and said he would make us something with it if we would let him do the whim thingy...again, do the whim! Of course we did it.  Oh My God it was sooo good! Now my boyfriend knows why I've been whining about this stupid duck liver ban in CA. Ridiculous hippies! People should have foie gras everywhere! It seemed like it was panseared and placed on top of toasted brioche with some sort of fruit sauce. It was not only beautiful, but probably one of the best things I've eaten in a really long time.   Anyway, if you have the pleasure of trying this place, I would tell you to get whatever the chef's making that day because he really knows what he's doing. And the waitress was so friendly and gave us a great happy hour experience. We both agreed that this place was our favorite place we tried in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I wrestled with 4 and 5 stars, so please read the review and make your own decision.  First off, you need a reservation.  We tried to stop by once and were turned away.  In retrospect that was somewhat odd because on the Saturday night when we went it was only about 2/3rds full for the evening.  Food:  The food was exceptional, well executed and nothing over the top.  They made good use of ingredients and everything paired well and had a lot of subtle touches.  I wont go into the details of the food because I am sure the menu changes frequently and there is plenty of detail here already.  Drinks:  Rather extensive back bar that was rather wide but oddly not very deep.  I.e. great selection of bourbons and whiskeys, but didn't seem that adventuresome.  I had an exceptional Boulevardier and a flawless executed Sazerac but they were very traditional.  It's tough to say I am disappointed with the drink list, I am really not, because it is so hard to find the basics done so well, but ultimately I was yearning for another layer of creativity.  Staff:  Very well trained, could talk intelligently on both the food and drink menus.  Was succinct without being too verbose and obviously well educated on the menu.   *Understand this is coming from someone who owned a Gastropub and is hyper-aware of the tight rope of staff training.  Overall the level of service coupled with the quality of the food was exceptional.  It was also reasonably priced.",

Make sure if you plan going make a reservation, they don't want to let you in without one. There is a bar but with like4 chairs and no standing room. The only weird thing about the need for reservations is there are constantly at least 5 open tables. Anyhow, cool place I would recommend but make sure you call ahead.",

    "text": "Usually we really like second story....  This time it just wasn't as good.  We had the Valentine's special and everything was okay....  But nothing was exceptional.   The bartender is very particular about being clean so he had us wait to sit and called my husband a mofo (in a light hearted fashion but still kinda inappropriate)  Our server forgot a few things ( our servers in the past were exceptional)  And the overall ambiance just wasn't as \"speakeasy\"/ dark and romantic  as usual.  It was louder, brighter, and more chaotic Than normal.  It was enough though for us to decide not to return again given the bill with 6 drink was 300$   Just not worth it.  Below is my previous review ---------------------------------- This is our new favorite date night spot.   Reminds me of SFO bars.  The staff is great, and drinks are on point.  It is a bit pricey though.  We really enjoyed the chefs board, and the beer bread!  Yumm!  They've had the same menu for a while- I look forward to a spring update (I hope)",

After finding Second Story on yelp, my sister knew she wanted a whiskey or bourbon! We decided on craft cocktails on the menu. I LOVE a good gin drink and they had some interesting options. I went with the Pendennis club and honestly, I was not a fan. I'm not sure if it was the bitters or what it was. I drink Gin often and this just didn't do it for me!!!! I would have much rather had a margarita. My sister got the Conquistador and liked the texture and enjoyed the aroma of the tea. The taste of tea was a bit muted but she really enjoyed the bourbon. This wasn't my favorite bar but I'd come back for the atmosphere but I might have the bartender make me something I know I like!",

Weird since I was with a friend and not my husband, so we opted for the balcony. Lol.  Our server was ultra friendly and took very good care of us. The balcony had a perfect view of scottsdale road,  so we we able to people watch while having a few drinks.  I would definitely return to this place and try the food next time! BTW, they have the best crushed ice of any bar I've been to! Til next time second story!",

It's a really classy place; dark inside, but not creepy or too dark--instead it has a really intimate feel that's very welcoming and relaxing.  I like the inside, but if it's not too hot out I definitely prefer sitting outside on the patio.  Nice because you're on the 2nd floor and there's a good bit to watch while sipping.  And you can vape or what-not out there so that's a plus for me.  (I like to sit downwind so I'm not bothering anyone else with it).  All the servers I've ever encountered were pleasant, helpful and quick in bringing our orders/refills.  Once even, upon leaving I asked about a location of some other spot I wasn't familiar with and the bartender plus a few servers got in on the convo and provided some help with that as well as other suggestions.  With all the rudeness in the world I found it refreshing to see others being so nice and helpful.   Oh, and the drinks aren't watered down, they are on point and the goose you order will be goose and not Smirnoff like some other places sometimes do, so there's that.",

Quick impression is of a cozy, classy almost out of the way spot that I will absolutely visit again.  Situated on the second floor over a pizza spot, you walk up the stairs into what gives the impression of a vintage, old-school bar you might find the Rat Pack hanging out in. Dark, yet warm tones, low light.    The bartender ( cocktail creator / genius ) Alli whipped up a tasty concoction called a Vespa artfully garnished with a nice lemon spiral on the rim. After chatting for a bit, we went out onto the patio / balcony to enjoy the nice late afternoon and watch the sights along Scottsdale Rd.    This feels like a great place to come and enjoy a drink, some dinner or appetizers ( I can't speak to the offerings since we didn't have anything to eat, but that will change next time ). Looks ideal for a variety of occasions from spending time with friends, an intimate date, or just some quiet contemplation on the balcony with your favorite drink.  I'll definitely be back.",

They change their menu based on the season, carrot fondue was a really surprising dish that I can't stop raving about. The shishito pepper app is fun but pretty simple, fun because it's like roulette if one them might be spicy.     Drinks are all well crafted, the waitresses know the menu so ask questions to get the right fit for you. Some drinks are stronger tasting than others.   On one occasion we called ahead, were seated, then moved (they asked us if we would) and then forgotten about. We left after 20 minutes when we still didn't have water. I've been back since and never had that happen again so I think it was a one off. Inside can get loud so we always opt for outside seating.",

This place is good as it can get, I've been here three times and all three times I'm met by the effervescent Brooke, who not only has a million dollar personality, she has exceptional taste in clothing. Second Story Liquor Bar, is that which reminds me of a hidden gem, the dark staircase may have there lawyers chagrin in lawsuit fear, but, for me it reminds me of going to a forbidden nightspot, mystery is often the best company and yes, the chase is better then the kill.  I love sitting at the bar, and yes these are real mixologists, there not bartenders, bartenders there most difficult drink is a rum and coke, with a lime. These mixologists make the best whistle pig I've ever tasted. can't wait, I'm making myself thirsty.   There menu is as eclectic as the floor staff. I've had the shrimp taco's which were exceptional, and the burger, which surpasses In & Out Burger, and just about any other burger I have ever had. Then there are the rabbit tamales, OMG, ok double OMG they are so good. This will become or is becoming my favorite spot.",

This place is more of a drinks and light food place rather than a restaurant. The crispy chicken that was in the menu was insanely salty, so much so that I could only have a few bites and  definitely not worth the almost $30. We also ordered meatballs which were decent but you only get three small meatballs with one little piece of toast; again not worth the price. Unfortunately my experience with the food at this restaurant was not as good as others that have reviewed.",

The premier \"mixologist\" not bartender, is well versed and incredibly creative. Also, she is very easy on the eyes guys.  The outside patio sits high above the main drag on Scottsdale Road through Old Town. From here you can take in all of the sites. I had the pleasure of meeting their chef and seeing his garden. Here he grows herbs, squash blossoms and much more. He is expanding it to the roof and growing so many more delectable items in a bio-sustained environment.  The interior is that old mafia feel or that Chicago Sinatra style bar. The back bar is filled with premium liquers and Single Malt Scotch's. This is a must if you are here. If you don't pop in while you are in town, you missed a great stop.   #vino2 #vinosquared #vino2ultimate",

The whisk(e)y menu is beautifully expansive.  The wait- and bar-staff have a comprehensive knowledge of their craft, I never felt pushed towards any menu option, but they have a talent for clearly explaining the depths of each dish and drink.  The setting of this place is also a spectacular complement to the offerings: a warm, intimate environment that feels like a high-class speakeasy transported forward in time.  To top this all off, the food is beyond compare.  If I had to choose between living 10 extra years or eating at least one more time at this place, well... a fair price to pay.  I'd trust this chef to make a five-star meal out of a cardboard box and a rusty bike wheel, but fortunately the kitchen has access to the best ingredients.  Basically: 5/5, would sell my soul to eat here regularly.",

It was mid-summer so she had me with the Monday special  \"$10 Burger + a Beer\".  What I've experienced over a few visits would be culinary delights matched with proper beverage pairings topped with excellent service.  The servers and bartenders work together to get you the experience you ask for.  If you need some quiet time with the person across the table from you, they give you that.  If you want to talk all night about quality bourbon, they've got that for you, too.    Food is top quality and prices are reasonable for that quality.  Drinks are as simple or as complicated as you desire.  A True hidden gem sitting right out in the open on Scottadale Road.",

We tried the cauliflower appetizer along with the Thai chicken wraps.  Both were exceptional.  Then we moved onto dinner where we ordered the salmon.  It was out of this world and cooked perfectly.

I originally came in to have a few drinks after I left dinner. The general manager came over and personally greeted me. We began talking and she explained the owner's vision for this place, the concept behind the theme of the bar, and so on. She then introduced me to the bar manager. This guy was the most knowledgeable person on bourbons I've ever met.   I originally asked for a Basil Hayden bourbon (which is one of my favorite bourbons) however after talking to the bar manager and him listening to what my pallet is and what I typically like, he recommended I try something new and suggested a Cody bourbon. I was very impressed at how much I liked it. His knowledge of bourbons led me to this one and I have now added it to my list of bourbons favorites. This is an experience that you do not get at 98% of the bars that you go to. Absolutely priceless in my opinion. I highly recommend Second Story. It is unlike any bar that you will ever go to.",

Or should I describe the posh decor and polished dark woods bathed in the glow of a gorgeous central chandelier?  I could even discuss the wait staff's elegant attire, from lace dress clad ladies to bartenders channeling the long lost charisma of decades past.  But all of that charm and talent pales in comparison  to the food at Second Story Liquor Bar. I....am struck between an intense desire to keep this place a secret and hoard it for myself and the responsibility of a foodie to attempt to convey how scrumptious it was. First off, know that I don't have the words. You will have to try it for yourself.   And when you do, please give yourself the gift of the scallops entree.....you deserve it. Order the Scallops Carbonar -- gnocchi duo / uni butter / caviar / English peas / chantarelle mushrooms / shaved fennel / everything right in this world -- and never look back. If you're quick to drop the \"I don't like scallops\" card I played, just don't. Because you do. You like these scallops.  To.Die.For.  But don't die yet, because there are a million other amazing things on the menu. We started with the Inside Out Caprese - um, yum!  Also had the Duck Breast Roulade.....be still my heart. Bacon wrapped, golden raisins, sweet onions, parsnip puree, brussels sprouts, orange gastrique. I didn't even know what orange gastrique was before eating at SSLB, now it's all I can think about.   The flavors, the textures, the beauty of the dishes, it is mind boggling to me how inexpensive this restaurant is compared to the value of the food. They use top-notch ingredients, the dishes were designed and are plated by people for whom food is an art. Everything they should have thought of to make this place special and original, they did. I will literally live here all summer, that much is guaranteed. Do yourself a favor and have your next date night or ladies night or night out by yourself celebrating your awesomeness at Second Story Liquor Bar. I'll be there.",

John the mixologist (not bartender) was awesome. This man knows his stuff. Me made a rum punch made of Appletons rum which made me wanna slap my momma (ask for it). If you haven't tried it, get on that Hibiki 12. They have it here.  The food was really good too. It was happy hour so we had multiple orders of the lobster corn dogs & the filet mignon sliders. I would only eat them during happy hours. The flavors are great but not worth the regular price for my (non-scottsdale) budget. I would definitely come back for the food & drinks but mainly to listen to John talk about makung awesome drinks. I might make one of those classes. Check out this pic of the rum punch!",

    "text": "We like Second Story for their selection of bourbons, whiskeys, Scotch, etc. The service is quite good and the atmosphere is lively and fun. Here's the rub: we've been 3 or 4 times in the last few months, most recently last night. The ladies at the entrance usually give us an inflated wait time. We have gotten around it on past visits but last night it seemed legitimately busy and we were told 45 minutes. Our choice was to make a reservation or put our name in and wait. We were also told they're strict about the reservations and we had to ask what did that mean? She was evasive then I asked if they likely take our credit card # and charge a minimum fee for a no show to which she agreed. We put our names on the wait list and then went right next door for our 45 minute wait, only to be called in 10 minutes. We had just gotten a cocktail and could not immediately return so we thanked them for the call but declined the table.  It appears as though the place tries to exaggerate its exclusivity by managing this way. There is obviously a disconnect bw upstairs seating and downstairs hostessing. If it were a one-time thing, I wouldn't have balked, but that's not the case. They either need someone more mature or professional as a hostess and/or refine the approach.",

I can't wait to go back when the weather cools down so we can sit on the patio and do some Scottsdale rd people watching. We had drinks only, no food this trip but the menu looked great.

They where in white fitted lace dresses along with beautiful pearls. . Once inside our waitress was splendid. She had a fitted lace dress except it was black and she as well was wearing white pearls. She had a lace ruffle apron, that was super adorable!!! Loved it! She answered all our questions, explained the drinks and recommended us a few of them as well. Now, i cant remember what drink it was that i decided to get, but when she brought out our drinks...she brought them out on a silver platter!! :D  The menu doesn't have a large selection but that is not a negative. I decided to get the duck breast roulade. It was absolutely sensational. The duck was wrapped in  bacon, it also had golden raisins, sweet onions, parsnip puree, brussels sprouts, and orange gastrique. It was absolutely remarkable. I was so beautifully plated. i wish I had a picture buttt...i got to busy eating.. One thing I appreciated was that they were willing to work with my very long list of allergies. This was amazing to me. Towards the end of our dinner Chef Josh Bracher came out and talked to us for quit a bit about our lovely dinner and our experience.   Its the small little details that make this place exceptional. I couldn't have been happier. If you are looking to find a restaurant with good quality food, then you should really go to SSLB. Reading the reviews wont do justice. You will need to experience it yourself. Whether its on a date or even if you take yourself on a date, your experience will be completely worth it!! 5 STARS!!!!",

The selection of music was kept at a volume that allowed conversation to flow easily without having to yell. Overall I highly recommend this place for a comfortable night of drinks and conversation.",

Lets just say I am a slow metabolizer of this certain alcohol beverage and every time I come here, I have a great time.  Was it the whiskey or the service and food that produced such joy,  I would ask myself the next day.   This time I stuck to basic drinks with Tito, and I must say, this place is fabulous.    The food is creative and well done.  The speak easy concept, if not done well, could have been real cheesy, but they hit it on the nail here.  Service is always friendly, if a bit slow.  The drinks, however are the main attraction.  Mixology at its best.    The icing on the cake is the Paul Harvey retro broadcasts playing in the restrooms.

    "text": "Came with a friend on a Monday night of all things. Got some pretty good seats at a bar, which started a really decent end for a night in Old Town.  Not really seeking anything crazy from the get-go, we opted to start with a Mint Julep and a Sazerac. Both were excellent renditions of the standard - coming at $13 a pop, it was a little expensive but excellent nevertheless. I'd totally show you, but the low light intimacy makes for shitty iPhone pics.  As you'd expect, the whiskey selection was solid - lots of options on the back page with plenty of tiered prices, plus a really good selection of flights. I liked their naming sense a lot - flights like \"Godzilla vs. Mothra\" showcasing some good Japanese whiskeys, for example. I really should have remembered the name, but the one we tried was a sample of Glens - which had a really nice range from that punch in the gut, a smooth finish, and some really damn good scotch. 3 glasses in that flight were about 34, and you have flights ranging from 20 to a fancy 200 one.  Really appreciate when your bartender has tried much more than what's on the menu - shows the thought that went into determining the menu. He really knew his stuff, and definitely helped us a lot finding the next whiskey that felt just right.  Wish I had the bankroll to become a regular here, but from the alcoholz' perspective the night was a success, plus the food menu looked pretty bomb as well. Looking forward to the next time I'm around the stairs.",

I think a restaurant like that should allow patrons to take their time, enjoy a first drink and not be asked every 5 min if \"everything is ok\". Upon selecting our food choice it seemed to come out in a matter of minutes which to me certainly can't be personalized. In terms of quality and tastiness the food was fine. We enjoyed it well enough but to reinforce my point they need to slooooowwww down. Just to put an objective number to my point from sit down at 8 pm on a Saturday to getting the check was 50 min !!!  I get they want to turn tables but that's way too quick for this type of restaurant.",

Location is great and the view from the patio is refreshing. Definitely a fan of the prohibition style decor and the staff is very swanky!

    "text": "Second Story Liquor Bar is awesome. They hit on all the important notes:  Food: outstanding. Fresh interesting ingredients cooked absolutely perfectly and with amazing flavor.  Try the Dandelion Gnocchi with anchovies....sounds weird but it is phenomenal.  These were by far the lightest, fluffiest pasta pouches I have ever eaten in my life.  Drinks: fantastic.  They specialize in bourbon drinks, and you once you taste one, you understand why.  I really enjoyed a cocktail called The Boulvardier (bourbon, campari and sweet vermouth with an orange twist...very refreshing).  Atmosphere: intimate. It's a very small space, so you feel extra special when you are able to get a table. Fantastic place to take a date.  I will definitely be coming back to cocktail and dine again!",

We literary walked out of our hotel, crossed the street and happened upon this place.   Ambiance was dark but really decorated well. Since bar was closing in an hour we had to order off the happy hour/late night menu. We ordered cocktails and the Cheesesteak.  This was so tasty and I think the loaf of bread was like a sweetbread.  Veggies were grilled and the flavor was like no other Cheesesteak I've tried.    I think looking at dinner menu and reviews I would definitely come back.   Strong Yay in recommending second story.",

It's a bit fancier than I was expecting but we didn't feel too out of place for not knowing. Menu is nicely laid out, like upscale bar or gastro pub food. Whiskey menu is on point, cocktails are fairly priced for what's in them. I judge a whiskey type joint by how well the old fashion is which was just simple and True to firm. Nothing snazzy which is good. Service was really nice, deco is interesting. Would go again! I don't know if they have another way up besides the stairs but didn't look like it. Stairs are pretty narrow as well. Probably not a good place for kids.",

We went with the restaurant week set menu, which included two apps and an entree. We also got the drink pairings.   The appetizers we tried were the octopus, a ravioli, a meat pasta, and a salad. All of these were amazing!! The best of which were the salad and meat pasta. We would definitely get both of these again. For the entrees we had the steak and salmon. The salmon was cooked a perfect medium as was the steak. The only negative comment is that the steak had a little bit of an irony flavor, but that just might be the cut of steak it was.   The drink pairings were all incredible and a good match for the food. The portion sizes are on the smaller size, which was nice to try lots of different dishes.   We will definitely be back here again soon!",

Anyway, we both got the tasting menu for $54pp and I ordered Hamachi Crudo, Roasted Beets, and Chilean Sea Bass. The crudo and beets were solid but nothing special. The problem was the sea bass; it was overcooked. And yes, the portions were tiny.  I expected more innovative food and perhaps my expectations were too high.",

Our waitress delivered a few cool stories about the menu.   The menu is really interesting.  There are little twists and additions that are in the dishes that really enhance the full flavor.  Tons of choices to pick from.  Since there are so many choices I highly recommend the tasting menu.  I did the 5 course and my wife did the 4 and we picked a few different options to share.  My 5 course came with a dessert. The description of the desert sounded good, but I didn't really like it.   Had I liked it I think it would have pushed this to a 5.  The drinks at this place are awesome.  I had a chocolate Manhattan and a mule, both were awesome.  My wife had this punch drink which she didn't like but then tried the pineapple champagne drink which she loved and had 2 of.   They took the punch off the menu, and I will say you can recognize a good restaurant because they took it off the bill without us asking, it was just an unspoken thing.  We got a few visits from a manager, and one from the owner Tommy.  Love the personal touch.   Definitely would go back to this place. Fyi it is spendy, but you don't leave feeling it isn't worth what you paid.",

    "text": "Wow.  What a find!  Don't like chains?  Like a one of a kind, boutique style, intimate environment, coupled with great atmosphere, food, cocktails and service?  Then, you need to go to the Second Story Liquor Bar, a new restaurant located on the Southwest corner of 3rd Ave. and Scottsdale Rd. in Old Town Scottsdale.  The name is derived from the fact that is in the same building as the super popular Gelato Spot on the second story!  From the moment you're greeted by one of the beautiful, gracious, classy hostesses, you'll get the feeling you're in the right place!  The menu is very unique and one would be hard-pressed to make a mistake in ordering.  A must have is the seared Caesar salad.  OMG!  A wedge of romaine lettuce is literally seared on a grill, then covered in this exquisite dressing, the likes of which I've never tasted.  I'm a big Caesar fan and this may be the best I've ever had!  I chose scallops for my entree and, what can I say other than Mmm, Mmm, Mmm!!  You've got to sit at the bar sometime during your visit and ask for John (with the small ponytail) and have him create for you one of the signature cocktails or an old classic like a Mint Julep, Old Fashioned or Gin Fizz!  This guy is a bartender supreme!  Everyone there has obviously been very, very well trained.  The attention to detail is immediately obvious and the wait staff can't do enough to please you.  All this, thanks to the terrific and lovely general manager, Tracey, a Brit from across the pond who takes great pride in her work.  Even the waitresses uniforms are something to behold.  Absolutely beautiful lace creations accented by pearl necklaces.  I love this place and so will you!  Brian K.",

After the demise of Old Town Whiskey at the hands of the Saguaro management, SSLB head alchemist John Christie has helped establish one of Scottsdale's most unique and engaging drink and food experiences. Based around a spectacular assortment of liquors (try all the bourbon, I have) the Second Story truly crafts a one of a kind experience with personal touch that is so infrequently found in Old Town. The food is an exciting treat and developing well as the chef gwts better and better! Come here and enjoy everything!",

    "text": "Second Story is one of our few 'go-to' establishments in all of Scottsdale. Everything about this place is exceptional. We had dinner there several times in the last year or so. We enjoyed it so much, we decided to have our wedding party there in mid July - an evening of dinner and drinks for about 35 people.   The owner, Tommy, is one of the nicest guys you will meet. No ego (despite his success), amazing customer service attitude, he sincerely cares about his guests and the experience patrons have.   Our event could not have gone any better. The staff treated us and our guests like royalty. The food, the drinks, the ambiance, the service - simply amazing. The chef is seriously talented. The food combinations, flavors, presentation, the taste - up there with any ultra high end place I've ever dined at. Great alcohol concoctions - very few of our guests left sober. Most people were staying at a resort in old town and Tommy even called golf carts to the restaurant to transport everyone.  Bottom line - Tommy, Josh and the staff made sure the event was a big success (so many of our guests raved about the experience). For a wonderful dinner, for drinks and apps, or if you are looking for a location for an event of any kind, I STRONGLY recommend you check out Second Story! Hands down - one of the best places in town.",

Very cute interior n the staff service was impeccable but the food didn't blow me out of the water for the price. We started w the cauliflower appetizer. Good. Very similar to other restaurants. I got the octopus entree, my husband got the chicken n mushroom pasta, my gf got the house special: lamb pasta n her husband got the short rib burger. I had a bite of everything n it was good except my husband's chicken mushroom pasta was super salty. I don't even kno how he ate it. He did say it was super salty but he was so hungry he ate it all. My octopus was absolutely delicious. Perfectly crunchy n crispy but so delicious on the inside. Short rib burger was good but hard to screw that one up. My gfs house special pasta was the best!!!   The interior was so cute n cozy. Would definitely come back for drinks but not so much for food. But don't get me wrong . Food was good. But it's more of a drink place.",

Great in all areas.   I was in the area for a business trip and was brought here by a local.   1. The drinks were so good. That is all that needs to be said. It's not just whiskey...they have other drinks as well so do not let that scare you off coming here with your favourite whiskey connoisseur.   2. The food the menu is small but mighty. There are a lot of choices for everyone for a little upscale of a palate. Your regular everyday dishes elevated. The presentation is very nice as well.   3. The service. So great! Our server was attentive but not over bearing. She was available for recommendations without being pushy and she was able to make substitutions for all my food allergies.   4. The atmosphere was really quite cozy, but not like you were sitting on top of the table next to you. Quiet without being like you were in church... but there weren't loud obnoxious people who the whole idea of going out with their friends is to just get drunk...like some dive bars (I do love a dive bar...but after a long day of work that is not what I was looking for). It is upstairs....But it is worth the little climb upstairs to get some deliciousness. Yum.   Come here if you want some delectable eats and some delicious drinks in a great atmosphere.",

Love the sweet raisins. - Ricotta gnocchi with roasted squash, crispy sage, and brown butter is perfect for fall. - Octopus- this was B's request. Served with yummy white beans and some grilled broccolini. - Stuffed pasta- the best thing I've eaten in a long time. This special was not on the menu Gorgeous green pasta stuffed with goat cheese and sunchoke, served with king trumpet mushrooms.  Tyler served up some tasty tipples including a fab Trinidad sour and a fun riff on an old fashioned. He introduced me to a mezcal cocktail that sounded terrible, but was actually really good. Look forward to seeing what else he has up his sleeves on our next visit.  Speaking of which, chef says that Thursday night pasta tastings are coming soon. And B wants to go for their oysters on Wednesday. Again soon!",

Here's a tip: If you like red wine. You order a glass of two different ones and let your date pick the one she likes best to drink.  Or get the bourbon flight!! Off the hook.

    "text": "I want to start this review out by saying the food and cocktails/wine I have had from The Second Story are amazing.   This issues I've had have always been with the staff.  My first experience was last summer, I took my Wife to the gelato spot and noticed that The Second Story had opened up their Bar/Restaurant upstairs since the last time we had been by, Awesome! We had been anticipating this place to open. We have traveled to places such as San Francisco, Seattle and Portland and were blown away by the niche speakeasy style cocktail lounges in those places. Now we have one so close to home!  It was typical summer afternoon weather, 115 degrees. We were not anticipating having cocktails, but the allure of the place was too much. Having ascended the stairs we were met by a friendly enough host and asked what we were interested in, we replied we wanted to experience their cocktails.  Where it gets choppy,  We were wearing shorts, with shoes and a polo shirt for me, nice top for wife.  The inside had 2 patrons at the bar, that was it.  We were sat outside, I asked why and they said because of our attire. I figured they had AC or something outside so i didn't fuss. Nope, we still tried 2 cocktails since we had already made up our mind to, but sweated through them quickly and left.  Now, Visit number 2 occurred this weekend, Saturday.  I figured it had been long enough, and based on so many good reviews maybe they just needed time to get a good rotating staff together. I also was coerced into a second visit by some gift cards my wife picked up from COSTCO. I figured if they backed this restaurant, their gift cards sitting next to Ruth's Chris and Roys it must have some good followings now.  We invited some friends from out of town who normally take us to nice restaurants so we wanted to treat.  As said, the food was amazing. Cocktails even at $16, incredible. We got a bottle fo wine and it was also fantastic.  What wasn't fantastic was when I submitted my AMEX with our $200.00 in prepaid \"as good as cash\" gift cards quietly to the waitress and they decided to come back and inform me the restaurant would only accept $50 of them.  So, lets see, that is embarrassing in front of my guests for one, I would have rather just paid cash than experience a bill coming back. Two, I have now spent a ton of money on gift cards, and now I need to pay a $360.00 bill including tip (which of course we were not planning on using the gift card for the tip, obviously) with only a minuscule portion of my gift card being usable.  What is the point of \"As good as cash\" on a gift card. I have NEVER had this happen to any well established restaurant on the COSTCO card wall. The whole reason is to pull me and others via gift cards to into your restaurant, thats why you offer the gift card deal option in the first place, yes?  Well I'll tell you what, The allure is gone. If you want to experience a new place or gift a friend/family member with a gift card, send them to a Fox  Concepts restaurant.",

    "text": "Second Story works at cultivating an exclusive speak easy vibe. A hostess on the sidewalk calls upstairs to a second hostess, who greets and seats guests. The interior is sleek black wood, mirrors, leather banquettes, crystal chandeliers. Guests chat over expensive cocktails and loud jazz. It almost works--the leather is worn and too much kitsch kills the sleek lines, but it's dark and everyone is pleasantly tipsy anyhow.  We started with the falafel, whipped feta, baba ganoush and pickled onions. I was a bit put off by the $13 price tag for three balls of falafel. That said, the falafel was perfect--moist with a hint of honey on the outside. The baba ganoush was excellent. My partner complained there wasn't enough of it--we had extra pita long after we ran out of feta and eggplant. I felt like it was a pretty perfect plate.  We split the ricotta gnocchi for our main course. My expectations had been set and I was disappointed. The gnocchi was on the dry side and completely under seasoned. There was a good variety of roasted squash and some of it was quite tasty, but I got hints of flavor that suggested the oil had hit its smoking point during the roasting process. It was an interesting dish, but not a particularly delicious one and probably not one I would order again. Not to be cliched, but a bit of browned butter would have gone a long way here.  The service was good and unobtrusive. My one complaint was that we weren't offered dessert. Perhaps the one glass of wine and shared appetizer and entree did not justify the valuable real estate we were occupying to the server. I just assumed there was no dessert menu, but when the server at the table next to us offered up something involving lavender and walnuts, I got a bit jealous. Dessert would have been nice, though there is gelato just downstairs.",

Service was okay a little negligent about water refills but definitely knowledgeable about whiskeys and craft cocktails, I was dinning with a relative who is a whiskey connoisseur so she was able to talk shop with our server.  I forget what whiskey craft cocktail I had but it was good.  I had the ricotta gnocchi which MY fault I didn't read the menu closely and it has roasted acorn squash and I HATE squash.

It has the old fashioned speakeasy feel and the food is amazing. I had the meatballs as my meal, and they were to die for. Service was impeccable. Our waitress made sure we didn't want for anything. One thing that doesn't make it five stars for me is, the place is small so it was a tight fit and for this leftie it made sitting on an aisle a challenge to not get bumped by people walking by.   I will definitely be back!",

I had the same dish two yrs when when I first came.  It was just as delicious as I remembered.  Then I believe your asst manager or manager (Mia) came out of the blue and just started a small chat w my friend and I. She offered up a suggestion we try WTF biscuits.  It didnt disappoint.  Thank you for top notch service.  Mia and Lori are some great young ladies you got there.  They are amazingly engaging and very sociable.  My friend was very impressed for this being his first time.  My third time.  One of my favorite bars.  Mia even informed us about ur sister bar.. Kazmir.. she recommended we try that place too.  It was a busy evening on a Wednesday.  But overall was a great quiet, engaging evening.  Thank you for an awesome experience.  I will be back again!",

It had been a while but the space was just as cool as I remember it. The speakeasy vibe makes you feel very Madmen-esque. We got a great spot in the corner and grabbed a cocktail to start. I opted for the whiskey sour (felt mandatory). It was smooth and strong, definitely dangerous if consumed in large quantities! The roasted carrot fondue was recommended to us so we opted for that as our starter. I LOATHE carrots but sweet baby Jesus! This was incredible! Not carrot-y at all and deliciously spicy. The Corn Flake gratin added the necessary crunch. It was served with bread cubes and assorted fruit/veggies. 10/10 would recommend. For my entree I went all in and ordered the ribeye (rare of course). Aside from home cooked steak it was one of the best I have ever had. Bao ordered the seasonal pasta with chorizo and I was fighting for a bite! I'm not normally a big pasta girl but this was a killer recommendation by the server. For my second cocktail I went with The Conquistador {Elijah Craig Small Batch Bourbon | Amontillado Sherry | Lemon | Spiced Tea | Allspice Dram | Egg White} and it was just as awesome as the whiskey sour but the lemon added a great tang. I wouldn't change a thang!",

The drinks were good.  I really liked the el Diablo del sol.  Had a few of them.  The mushroom flatbread was ridiculously good.  I probably could have stayed their all night We were the only ones on the patio but we were attended to often and it was a really nice vibe  Our hearts wanted Mexican so we decided to have a few drinks and an appetizer and then go have dinner elsewhere.   I'm disappointed about the food I didn't stay to try it but I'm sure it's good I assumed that if you are at a taco festival, you do Mexican food.  I understand getting your name out there but it's just weird.  *** You're right.  It's just not what we were expecting but that's no reason to knock you. I put it to five stars because it was really a place I could drink all night.   Btw, the tacos you served at the taco festival were ridiculous good.",

    "text": "Long day of work in San Francisco, racing to catch a plane (that's naturally delayed) and getting into Scottsdale after 9pm -- what do we possibly do for dinner?  When we spotted Second Story, the choice seemed fairly obvious and we were rewarded for it.  It's ostensibly a liquor bar/cocktail bar as evidenced by the name, but don't be fooled -- they make really good food here as well. To get in, talk to the host outside to the left of the pizzeria and they'll get you set up and then head up the stairs. Once you get there, you'll see tons of dark woods and lush, deep browns highlighting what is a great upscale addition to the scene. You wouldn't think this was out of place in LA or New York.  Drinks as you might imagine are delicious and the food is really good. Highly recommend the Diablo Del Sol, which our waitress listed as her favorite and, as for food, you can't go wrong with 'Don Just Wants Some F*cking Bolognese'* which is only on the happy hour menu.  And the happy hour menu is where it's at. Sure, you could get there early and do the typical happy hour but what you really want is to get there after 9 and do the happy hour menu then. You don't need a full meal here -- the HH portions are fairly meaty. And combined with a few cocktails**, you can get out for a fairly decent price. The two of us, with drinks, were under $100 for dinner tip and tax included.  The only thing I didn't really love about it, and hence the four stars, was the theme -- having them 'take us on a journey' or explaining 'the story of the menu' that we would 'be experiencing' were a bit much on the pretension side. But the food greatly outweighs anything else you could dock them for. And considering they've only been open a month, they'll probably smooth that out down the road.  Try to sit outside. It's really nice!  * - the story we heard: the owners' father, named Don, owns the pizzeria downstairs and whenever they would take him out to dinner, he always ordered pasta and bolognese. So what you'll get here is delicious, homemade pasta and some seriously large meatballs. You can't go wrong.  ** - designate a DD, kids.",

We had asked for Tommy ( the owner )as our last visit review was acknowledged by him personally, and he requested that we asked for him.

    "text": "I had been anticipating to eat here since before SSLB opened and what better time to try it than restaurant week! They had a different menu for the week rather than the current one for the month. I did all three courses plus the drink pairings.   For the first course I had the Crispy Sweet Breads with frisee sundried tomatoes, smoked pickles green onions, balsamic fig glaze and dandelion mouse and a New England Mule to accompany it. The dandelion muse was so interesting! It was probably my favorite part of the dish aside from the sweet bread, of course. Everything was so light and it all blended so well. I'm a huge mule fan and the New England mule was nothing short of delicious.   For the second course I had the Spinach Ricotta Gnudi with rapini pesto, bruleed cherry tomatoes, golden raisins, pine nuts, balsamic glaze and seasonal wild mushroom. I'm gonna go ahead and say that I am a huge mushroom hater but on this night I set aside our differences and actually ENJOYED them greatly in this dish. And oh my god, can we talk about the bruleed cherry tomatoes?! I want a lifetime supply of these!! This dish was paired with a Hemingway Daiquiri which I thought was super appropriate. Hemingway said these drinks \"had no taste of alcohol and felt, as you drank them, the way downhill glacier skiing feels running through powder snow.\" And yeah, I couldn't agree more. He would've been proud of both the dish and his namesake drink.   For my third and final course I had the Veal Chop with melted fennel bulb, tomato mustard relish, confit tomato and creme fraiche bound farro. Okay so I'm going to rant and rave about how absolutely PERFECT the veal was. It was seriously cooked so perfectly! I could have ordered seconds or thirds. Probably even fourths. Actually I would have made all three of my courses this dish. I could have wiped that kitchen out of this dish if allowed to. It was absolutely AMAZING. And the mint julep that was paired with this was so refreshing on that warm Arizona night.   My dining experience at SSLB was nothing short of amazing. I will definitely be going back to check out and try the regular menu.",

The selection for cocktails is interesting and my boyfriend was impressed at the selection of liquors they had. Our server was prompt and attentive, and the drinks came out quickly. The only downfall to my visit was the noise. It is a very small place and there was a group of 13 celebrating a birthday. It was really loud so I had a hard time talking to my boyfriend across the small table. There's really nothing you can do about that though! We ended up only staying for one drink but it was nice to try this place for the first time. We will be back.",

I ordered the salmon and received a plate with a 2.5 oz. piece of fish and a parsley sized chip of cauliflower with a smear of puree on it! I sent it back and so id my husband.  I ordered 2 glasses of wine and found out when I got home that we were overcharged for both-my husband told me what they charged after we arrived home. You need to order a few courses---I am only a 128 pound person and I can tell you portions are SMALL! (And the 2 desserts offered were $12 and 14!) The menu is limited and small.  If you don't see anything, the hamburger looked very good but came with no sides. The server had to be grabbed from the aisle because she was so busy; I am glad it wasn't me or my husband who did that. Also, they asked us to leave when I was done eating because they had people waiting. It was a bad experience but the friends we dined with were a good consolation.  It was a waste of energy. It was just insulting.",

We went with friends for Restaurant Week.  We will not be heading back any time soon.  Service was very attentive.  The ambiance has been overstated by many other reviewers - it's got a little bit of kitsch, but in the end, the tables are extremely close to each other and the noise level is on the high end.  It is definitely not an intimate dining experience.  The food was very good, but not home run material.  The entree of venison that I ordered was served raw on the inside.  I'm not talking a little bit on the rare side, it was sashimi raw.  Having not been asked how I would like my meat prepared, I assumed it would be cooked.  I'm a medium-well kinda guy, but my dining partner likes her meat medium rare and she sent hers back to be cooked.  We ordered a dessert of foie gras and donuts, and it was just weird.  All 4 of us tried it, but none of us liked it.  You must really have to like foie gras to enjoy this dessert.  We are not really cocktail kinda people, but they did look tempting.  The regular menu looks like it is probably over-priced for the serving sizes that we got during Restaurant Week, but it was worth trying once.",

I have been to The Second Story Liquor Bar on multiple occasions, some by myself and some with friends. Every time I have been to this place I have yet to have a negative experience.  The staff is always friendly and is very accommodating. The concept of this place is new and refreshing. I was never a whiskey fan until John introduced me to a single barrel whiskey that I continue to drink every time I stop in.  But, in my opinion, the best part is how good the food is.  The happy hour menu like Chicken Katsu sliders is one of my favorites, to their dinner menu with the steak and crab on top, is just as good as any steak restaurant in the valley.   Keep up the good job because you've not only won me over as a patron but you also have won over my friends and theirs too!",

The service was awful, and Mgmt was even worse with the way it was handled. Everyone's food came out at different times, so we never had the chance to eat together. It became awkward when I was the last person to receive my food, and had everyone waiting on me. The food and service took about 3 hours to finish our meal, which is unacceptable. There are only about 40-50 total people in the restaurant, so it should never take 3 hours to get an entree. I would not return to this restaurant, and only would recommend it to the French or any others who enjoy a 3 hour dinner service. They need to change Mgmt and service in order to make this place a success. Bartenders are the only thing keeping it in business right now.",

It's a very cozy but well-designed bar atop Gelato Spot.  Its really neat the way they have a viewing glass sky light type thing that looks into the Gelato Spot from the restaurant as well.  They also have a patio that we were able to enjoy because it's still not too hot.  Not the loveliest view, but definitely interesting being able to look down at the comings and goings of Scottsdale Rd.    The staff was VERY attentive.  Can they be a little less attentive?  Maybe just a smidge..  but it was mostly a nice attentive.  On the other hand dinner took about 2 hours.  It was the 3 course for restaurant week, but there were long gaps in between courses.  Not overly annoying tonight, but we were glad we didn't have any other plans.  For 1st course we had the beet mix and the quail.  Both were very delicious and presented beautifully.  The next course was scallops and chicken for us.  The scallops were done perfectly and seasoned pretty well.  I wish more potatoes came on the platter, less carrots but other than that no complaints.  Maybe some arugula or some green would have been pretty.  It was still one of the best scallop dish I've ever had.  The chicken worked less well, we thought the blue cheese though spotty was a bit strong.  It also needed a little more salty meat - sausage or more prosciutto maybe?  The last but not least course was foie gras and veal chop.  It was actually our first time tasting foie gras - though I don't think we'll ever miss it, it wasn't bad and I believe it to be a solid representation of the delicacy.  The veal was tasty, presented nicely in slices over some grainy base.  This dish was also very good but could have used a little sweetness (cranberries?).  All in all, this was a very enjoyable dinner with dishes that were well thought out.  Everyone we talked to were helpful and not pretentious at all which was refreshing.  We're glad we tried it out.  Happy hour didn't seem to include any food items which was disappointing as we're not big drinkers, but I think I would like to return to try some more offerings even at regular pricing.",

The friends we took with us can be a little \"persnickety\" about restaurants, so I hoped they would also like it. They raved about it!!  Our drinks were fabulous, trying a few off of the menu, then when they were so good, I had the bartender make a \"bartenders choice\" drink for me. Wonderful. I drank a little more than I should have, but well worth the headache this morning!!   Then, the food, again, pleasantly surprised with each thing we ordered. If you are not a fan of spicy - then just ask about that with each item. A couple of things were a bit too spicy for me - but I'm a spice wimp. Everyone else thought it was fine. We all had bites of each others food. YUM!!!!!!  We will go back for the drinks and the food!!!",

They texted me saying it was a memorable meal comparable to Binkley's!  I will be going 11/1.  Often times the restaurant week deals are not as delectable, this was not at all the case.  The decor, theme, food, service are all setting the bar for other local Scottsdale specialty bars. Thank you for making this a special occasion for all of us.",

It was so fresh and the aroma was incredible.  I could smell all the ingredients.  Second course was the clam chowder.   Amazing.  The crab was fresh and the chowder was creamy.  Third course was the snapper.  The skin was perfectly crispy.  Fourth course was the chicken tandoori.  Every bite was a flavor explosion. Last course was the pineapple cake.  Not great but okay.  The cake was dry and the flavor combo didn't work for me.  Overall this was the best food experience I have had in Phoenix.  I'll be back again when the menu changes.  So happy to see a young creative chef succeeding!",

We ordered a variety of dishes including Carrot Fondu, Sashimi Pepper salad,, crawfish, Breads, Bison Burger, Chicken and desserts... (Trying to keep this concise). All of this and two rounds of drinks cost $500. If the food and drinks were actually good this would be well justified. However, the wait staff had no clue about drinks in general and specifically here (whatsoever ) and had little input on the new menu. The \"mixologist\" couldn't even make a correct old fashion...Waitress actually forgot our first round! The menu was a mashup of very ordinary and unsuccessful attempts at gourmet american fare. Proportions were varied and reminiscent of an episode of chopped where they give some enormous app portion and a tiny unrefined dinner portion. Desert was a salted fudge thing with overcooked \"sugar cookie\" and vanilla water filled gelatin spheres served on a spoon, on a marble round, with smeared  mousse...blah blah senseless. It became humorous and for that we ended up having a blast poking fun at the overall experience.  It all kind of smashed into this hilarious michelin wannabe glory hole surprise. Its pretty obvious this is a cooking school dropout/ dream up pointless concoctions on grammas couch over bong rips and cartoon network situation... sorry for the rant!",

I had some friends in town for the first time and didn't know where to take them since they've already been to all the spots I like. I hoped I wouldn't disappoint them since I didn't know what to expect.  I arrived at 8pm and was suprised to find out there was a wait...thankfully it was only about a 5 minutes. After chatting with the hostess Gabby, who was super kind and sweet, I found out that they have a great late night menu (available 2 hrs before closing), everything is freshly made in house,  and I should probably make a reservation next time I come. The decor inside was classy, fun, dark and kind of a speakeasy feel. It looks bigger on the outside so I now realize why it's better to make a reservation. We all just had drinks which were good but nothing exciting. If you are a whiskey drinker you'd probably love what they have to offer since they have a huge whiskey menu. I do wish that they offered more \"girly\" drinks. Our waitress mentioned that they change the menu often. I'm not sure if she was referring to drinks, food or both.  Overall everyone enjoyed the experience at Second Sorry. I really liked the decor, vibe, service and would like to explore their food menu.",

    "text": "It's been a few weeks since I visited second story and I'm still not entirely sure how I felt about it...  Let's start with the food, the food was 5-star and up there with the best meals in Phoenix. My group had the tasting menu, featuring all of the appetizers, the duck and the flank steak. We couldn't agree on the best appetizer as they were all stellar and the main dishes were perfect. The food was fun, inventive and best of all very accessible to non-foodies and foodies alike.   The problem here is the drinks. This is advertised as a liquor bar and has a strong slant toward whisk(e)y.  I expected some high quality wonderful cocktails to go along with the excellent food and I was flatly disappointed. The drinks were inconsistent, ranging from overly syrupy to over diluted.   As part of the tasting menu we also had the whiskey pairings. Each whiskey was excellent and paired well. One, the lagavulin 16, earned a spot in my bar at home. The problem was the waitress could barely tell me what I was drinking let alone give any detail on it. I suppose sitting at the bar might produce a better result but seating there was quite limiting.   The straw that broke the camels back however was the ending. Suffice it to say there was a not-so-slight price discrepancy that led to the bill being about $100 more than expected. It seems this can be chalked up to the waitress being poorly trained or unsure of the products available. To second story's credit, they fixed the issue for us...but it left a sour taste the way they tried to laugh it off like it was no big deal.   Bottom line, go for the food. Have a sip of whiskey or four, double check the bill and go somewhere else if you'd like a cocktail.",

    "text": "Let's start off by saying that the food at Second Story is great. I went there with my friend and his fiance so we each got their 3 course tasting with wine and whiskey pairings. We decided to get one of each of their \"Opening Fare\" so that we can sample all of the appetizers and I must say that they were all tasted very good. I especially liked the Buttermilk Pasta and the Crab Fritters. For my main course I got the Cardamom Crusted Duck. I have not eaten duck before but this was very good. The highlight of night for me though was that I finally tried some Yamazki 18yr whiskey. This is hands down the best whiskey I ever had.   Let's talk more about the Yamazaki 18yr. I originally intended to get the Yamazaki 12yr but the waitress informed me that they were out of it but that they just got some Yamazki 18yr in. She said it will be a little more expensive and I said that's fine since I already knew the price from looking at the menu earlier. I get my whiskey and I happily enjoy drinking it. After we got the check, I noticed something very strange about it. They charged me $150 for the Yamazaki 18yr. I looked back at the menu to make sure I was not seeing things and it turns out I wasn't. The menu lists the whiskey for $56 which is a large difference in price. Okay, I figured someone made a mistake so I inform the waitress to get this corrected. She proceeded to explain to me that the price in the menu is a misprint and the bill was correct.   What? You mean somebody accidently typed $56 instead of $150 and no one noticed? I told her no, I am paying $56 just like the menu says with no compromise. People make mistakes but give me a break. The Yamazaki 12yr is listed at $18 where as the Hibiki 12yr is listed at $25. Likewise, the Hibiki 21yr is listed at $100 where as the Yamazaki 18yr is listed at $56. Following this logic, you might as well list everything for $1 and charge $500 each at the end of the night. Sorry, but this is a very bad practice and bad business. The waitress even had the nerve to giggle as she was telling me about the misprint. After 20+ minutes, $94 was removed from the bill. I guess they thought that after having whiskey that we wouldn't notice the price difference. This is a very shady practice and the reason I gave Second Story Liquor Bar in old town Scottsdale a low rating.  Overall, the food was great, the service was great, and I enjoyed my whiskey. Probably not a bad spot for a date. My advice to everyone is to enjoy the atsosphere and food, but pay close attention to the bill as they might decided something on the menu is priced incorrectly and that they should charge you more for it.",

The upper level balcony is tight but cozy and overlooks Scottsdale Rd and 3rd. The menu is laid out like a script with plot twists and main story lines...\r\rI ordered the four course tasting (up to seven are available) and made it chefs choice. My server, Loren, was beautiful beyond stunning and elegant as well. And so too were all the staff and my nearby dinner guests as well! They have a reverse happy hour which means this could be a good late night stop.\r\rMy first drink was the corpse reviver (appropriate as I was reading the hunger games as I was dining alone and lots of corpses in that book that needed reviving... and got it...), and it was refreshing like a lemonade. The GM even came out to say hello and share some excitement. And all the while, the music was great!\r\rMy first course was the inside out caprese which was amazing and complex and quite large for a tasting item! And the olive oil dust on it was unique and fun! It was followed by a perfectly sized sea bass over a bed of farrow, something I would never have picked, but man it was GREAT! I told Loren that I was avoiding sugar, so I wasn't interested in drinks with sweet and sour or simple sugars... she laughed and talked about how amazing their ingredients were and brought me my second drink... and it was delicious.  My third drink was a blueberry cobbler if I remember correctly. I could pick my second drink off the menu, but can't recall the name now and apparently some of my notes didn't survive the night. :)\r\rAfter the sea bass I was served veal, and quite a large amount of it too. One piece on a bone, the other two not. I am not a veal fan, but I ate it and as far as Veal goes, it was right on.  My final course was the Prime steak and it was absolutely perfect. I avoid prime rib and rib eyes as I don't like fatty meats, but this one was trimmed perfectly, just full of amazing flavor and no fat at all visible. And the mango gelle was great!\r\rNot only did the GM pay me a visit, but other waitresses came out to say hi, and then the owner! And then the chef! It is a rare treat to get to talk to a beautiful waitress, her wonderful colleagues, her GM, the owner and the chef all on your very first visit! Without a doubt, service is their number one mission and so is elegant unusual food!\r\rThis has moved into my number one spot for a pre bar hop dinner in oldtown and I will be going back again soon!",

    "text": "Because of it's name, i've only come here for liquor. I have been here several times, but I have never eaten here, maybe if it was called meat bar, then odds are I would have. But i digress.    First of all the \"bar\" itself is tiny, theres like maybe 5 desirable seats at the bar. So getting a seat at the bar is not a convenient process. It starts with standing outside on the sidewalk & attempting to get the attention of the hostesses that give you attitude as if you're interrupting them from their latest snapchat & instagram updates.   Have faith though, you will eventually be sat. In contrast, the bartenders themselves usually give great service & make pretty good drinks. Are they amazing drinks, no, but still very good. The prices are a tad high, but that's kind of expected since you're probably paying for their prime location.   Overall, this place is just ok. This place is right on par with the other decent cocktail bars in the Scottsdale area. You can defintely do much worse, at the very least you'll get a decently made cocktail here.",

We arrived at 11:30 pm and were unaware that they closed at 12. Still, we were seated and greeted with great service. They were nice enough to let us stay until 2 am. During the time, we got to meet almost everyone. The owner came out and talked to us personally. Tracey was kind enough to greet and welcome us as well. Since then, this has been our date night stop when we are in the mood for good food, drinks, and great service.   The next time that we decided to go was just as amazing. EVERYONE remembered us and welcomed us back. Susie was our waiter once again which was fantastic. She remembered what we liked to drink. It is hard to find a place with such personal service. We sat inside this time and it was amazing. The atmosphere was very intimate, classy, and romantic. Our waiter talked us into doing a three course meal. We started with the Pork sliders, then the Duck Roulade, and finally Peach Cream Rum Cake. Our waiter and the owner both recommended our choices and we were glad that they did.   I've been back several times since and I'm glad to be welcomed back every time. I definitely recommend this place if you're in the mood for gourmet food and drinks at great prices.   We will definitely be returning soon!!! :)",

But Friday night here is now is bustling which pleased me as I hope this establishment does well.   The decor is lovely, and would be perfect for a date night, girls night, or any other intimate evening. The crowd is sophisticated and slightly older and dressed up (Read: you won't find students here being rowdy, drunk, loud and disorderly) The bathrooms and clean and fresh and the staff are very attentive while not being overbearing.  I always order an Old Fashioned to judge the bartenders skills, I was quite impressed and I'd say that this is the best place for an old fashioned in the Phoenix area. The other drinks are equally impressive although can swing on the sweeter side.  The menu is very unique and creative and executed well. Can be somewhat heavy handed at times, but I guess thats just the American way. The portions are large and shareable. I would highly recommend the lobster panna cotta, and the dock confit main!   My only pet peeve is that the waitress couldn't properly pronounce foie gras and kept saying \"The Fois of the day...\" which irked me to my bones.  Overall I would recommend!",

The oysters are sourced from Chula Seafood which is a local (and San Diego) fishery which sources the highest quality fresh fish from the Pacific Ocean.  Oysters are a treat and on this weekly special we enjoyed 3 dozen! The oysters are served with traditional relishes but we like them plain out of the shell and wow, love that fresh ocean taste. Also enjoyed the WTF homemade biscuits! Surprising addition to oysters but jam on a warm biscuit was yummy. Cocktails and wine selection is excellent. Our server, Lori, was personable and helpful. We live here and will be back soon!",

Our waitress was spot on, knowing all of the details of the menu and helping us decide what to order.  We really enjoyed sitting outside and although the balcony is narrow and small, it was nice to enjoy the outdoor air.  The food was exceptional.  We ordered a couple share items which were enough for our small appetites, but then moved on to an after dinner drink and something sweet.  Normally a non traditional item, we ordered biscuits for dessert which were off the charts.  Caitlyn suggested we add the nip of Whistle Pig Bourbon Aged Maple to the dish so, of course we did.  OMG, it was heavenly!  She paired it with a special coffee drink of her choice and it was perfect.  So not to digress, but I need to mention something about the scallop dish we had because it was also amazing! Scallops tender and succulent, cooked perfectly with the most delicate and delectable array of baby vegetables. It was a special that day and it was wonderful!  Liked the experience so much, we returned with friends a couple days later.  Yep it was great then too!",

    "text": "I first visited second story several years ago for happy hour with a friend and was very impressed with their food (mainly their homemade bread mmmm) and drinks. So when I was looking for a place to go with a group of 4 for restaurant week, it seemed like a good excuse to give this place another shot. Unfortunately, the experience was not so hot. It wasn't the food....well....most of it anyway. It was mainly the service.   We were seated on the patio, which was nice. Our waitress ran through the menu. We ordered our 3 course restaurant week meal and added a couple orders of biscuits with their special butter and bacon jam at the waitress's suggestion. We received the biscuits....which were very tasty....but not butter or jam. No one came around for awhile, so we ate the biscuits as is. When the waitress came back, we mentioned we never got the butter or jam so she brought some out, but at that point we only had maybe half a biscuit left. The jam was awesome! Just wish we had had it with the food.   So then the apps come out.....their fine...no problem. When it's time for the entrees, the waitress came by and took all our silverware. Then two meals were dropped off....but no silverware. Then many minutes go by. The other two meals don't come. The silverware doesn't come. No one comes outside. Then desserts start to be delivered..... We had to tell them that they only ever brought two of the 4 entrees and never brought utensils to eat with. I get mistakes happen, but the kicker was they prepared the other two entrees and brought them out but didn't replace the original two....so their food was ice cold. Not a good showing. I had the short ribs and, while I liked them, the other two people who got them did not (maybe because theirs was cold).   So then it's time for the actual dessert. This may have been the most disappointing part of the meal. They billed one dessert as a Nutella budino, which at every restaurant I've ever had it at (which is many), is a firm pudding in a cup or jar . What I was served was a Nutella soup with pretzels and bananas floating in it. The pudding didn't set. I don't know if that was intentional or not, but it was not very good. The other dessert was a plum upside down cake of sorts....it was sad and dry....no one ate their dessert.   So at the end of the meal the waitress knew we hadn't had a great experience and said she was sending over the manager. We waited another 10-15 minutes. The manager never showed. The waitress came back and offered us 15$ off cards for a future visit..... A little weird given a future visit is probably not going to happen. I guess the manager was too busy to come talk with us.  Additionally, when we received our check, we were charged for the bacon jam and butter that we didn't get until after the biscuits were eaten (they took it off when asked).  Bottom line: the bread here is awesome, the food here is good (but not as good as it is expensive), the dessert here is not so good, and the service, at least on our visit, was appalling. Won't be back.",

We had to put in our name and wait about 30 minutes which was fine because then we got to get gelato while we waited. There's a fire pit outfront that you can sit next to you while you wait. The hostess was extremely nice as well as the waiter. When we got inside, we got a corner booth. The booths are so comfy and the decor is dark, modern, and manly. There is a giant crystal chandelier hanging in the middle of the room which isn't manly, but brings the whole room together. This is perfect for a romantic night out. My husband and I only got cocktails because we did not know it was also a restaurant and had eaten before. When I go back, I will definitely get the grilled cheese and tomato soup. The food looked and smelled amazing.  We both got drinks with absinthe in them and they were absolutely amazing! The cherry in my drink was so good. I have never tasted a cherry that good before. I will be back for sure!",

The atmosphere is really cool (dark, hip with a bi of swank in the mix), the drink menus is refreshing and innovative (broken up into different eras for a time machine of booze!), and the drinks are made with care.   At this point most people are unplugging their phones to head there way but hold on.  The complaints I have deal with the food. At first the restaurant had great portion sizes and delicious food. Then one of those fell off and it's the portion size. After three recent visits I've come to realize the food is way over priced for what you get. (I even asked the waitress about the change and she did not appreciate the observation). In fact the wait staff is friendly but a bit quick with you. As though saying \"you need to be quite to understand the depth of our restaurant.\"   Probably too deep into that last point but I don't need someone to explain away why I spending 20 plus dollars for a rather modest size meal when there are so many wonderful restaurants in this area.   Conclusion: great place to start the night for a drink. Stay away from the food since you will end up resenting what was ordered for not satiating Your hunger.   To try: phil fish punch cocktail, pins cup cocktail.",

Main courses did not all come out together.  One plate was forgotten altogether (see The Good). Gnocchi bowl was tiny and tasted burnt.    The Ugly:  Seemed a tad over-priced for what we got.  $6 ice ball in a drink which was not divulged until after questioning the bill.  The option for regular ice cubes was not even provided.  It's the typical Old Town Scottsdale restaurant trying hard to be classy and provide a unique gastronomic experience but not quite hitting the mark.  Maybe, given time?  I think I'll stick to Phoenix (downtown, midtown and uptown).",

    "text": "05/01/2017, 7pm, table for 6  Based on the the amazing reviews on Yelp about Second Story's food, drinks and ambiance, we decided to have our last dinner here this past Monday. We came to Scottsdale for a bachelorette, so the speakeasy style venue and ambiance was great. However, our dining experience was far from perfect..  Food - we ordered the brussels sprouts and mussels, those were both delicious! For our mains, we ordered the NY Strip Loin, the Market Fish (Lingcod), and the Bolognes. I'm no food snob but none of these were good, all were underwhelming at best - under seasoned and flavorless. Steak - for almost $50USD, I could have grilled a better tasting steak myself on the barbecue, there was absolutely ZERO flavor...we had to ask the server for salt and pepper! The Lingcod dish was poorly executed - the fish was dry and overcooked, lacked flavor, and the \"risotto\" (or so they called it) was literally bland, watery rice. The fish was also served with \"gnocchi\" but this was more of a flattened potato than a gnocchi. When we asked for salt and pepper the server did not ask about the food or how it tasted.  Drinks - we ordered a bottle of Prosecco and a Cabernet Sauvignon, they were fine.  Service - our server (a blonde lady with an athletic build) for the evening was not particularly friendly. She checked on us once or twice but it wasn't until halfway through our meal that she asked how the food was. One of the girls expressed that the food was just \"okay\" and needed salt, perhaps that displeased her as she never came back to our table after that (except to hand us our $400USD bill).  This is the first time I have felt the need to write a Yelp review as I have never left a restaurant feeling so disappointed on all levels. This meal cost us almost $600CAD but the food and service did not reflect that, not even close. Kind of a sour end to our amazing weekend in Scottsdale, we will definitely be back, just not to Second Story.",

Drinks and food are 5 star quality and too pretty to eat but we demolished them anyways. GET THE PIMMS CUP! Delicious cocktail with bright and fresh herbal tones it went down so smooth. From beginning to end the service was impeccable and all of our food arrived in perfect unison. Park behind the gelato shop and walk around for FREE PARKING.  The cherry on top was the way they completely accommodated me with their own vegan creation because there wasn't one already available on the menu. It was very good, but with a top chef in the kitchen it wasn't too much of a surprise. The only con was feeling like the majority of things were overpriced. Definitely would come again for a special occasion but this is not a place you can come daily unless you got money to burn. Perfection!",

The drinks were amazing! very well made but had some ingredients that I had never heard of and when i asked our waitress she didn't know what was in the drink either. the atmosphere is dark and has that \"loungey\" feel which we really liked for a fun date night. it's kind of a smaller place so we could hear the conversations next to us but overall I'd give the setting and drinks a 5 star.   We started out with the biscuits which were incredible! they melt in your mouth and come with a spicy jam. I'd have those again any day. Unfortunately, the menu is really limited and we wanted to make sure to enjoy our meals so we ordered the two simplest things. A burger and spaghetti bolognese. First impression- the food came out fast, I was impressed because it was a busy night and expected the wait to be much longer. the presentation was great too. it looked delicious! Then i realized why the food came so fast.. the burger was almost completely raw and the spaghetti was hard- almost crunchy and completely undercooked. I had a bite of the burger and I couldn't even swallow it! My boyfriend sent it back and they brought out a brand new burger which was nice and it was much tastier so we were happy with that! I tried to eat the pasta but ended up setting it to the side. The taste was great the texture was not.   We ended up receiving $35 gift cards but nothing was taken off the check. We were okay with this. I think we will definitely be back to sit at the bar and order the biscuits and drinks but not sure about the entree's. Not to mention $35 doesn't get you very far at this place. Definitely worth a second chance!!",

The waitress made several mistakes and instead of communicating effectively, she tried to cover it up.  The final mistake was when she presented one bill and once we gave our payment she switched it.  Our original bill was $61 when she came back for a signature the bill showed $93.  Scam.... Dishonest....Rude....Disrespectful.... Finally we spoke with the manager who was absolutely not interested in what our concerns were and was reeking of alcohol.  He was unprofessional did not acknowledge or remedy the situation he instead made it worse.  In the end he told us to get out of his restaurant.  Maybe it was the alcohol talking..or maybe it was because we were of a different color...or maybe he doesn't value his customers.  Overall I will never visit this establishment again.  Customers never deserve to be treated rudely when mistakes are made you apologize for the mistake and remedy the situation...  To the owners comment..that is absolutely unTrue we never asked for a free meal, we were not aggressive (he only said that because we are African American).    Do not be fooled by reviews at the top go to some of the earlier reviews and you will know he has a lot of nasty things to say about his customers after they leave a review, as well as a lot of misrepresentation with the bills and prices.    Check your receipts carefully.    Don't take my word for it read the reviews for yourself.",

Hmm. the waitress was essentially just there. not good, not bad, just dropping a drink off and then we didn't see her again until we flagged her down for a check. we would've had another round, but our group got better service at another bar so we went back to it.   decor is quite impressive and so is the crowd...very pretty and good looking people.   maybe just an off night for our server.",

    "text": "Food/ambience: 4 out of 5 The food here was very tasty and you could tell it was made with quality ingredients. Portion sizes are on the smaller size which is what you would expect from a place that likely considers itself fine dining.   Drinks: 2 out of 5 Our server said the drinks were all new and properly balanced meaning not too sweet or too tart. I ordered one of the cocktails with gin and I personally felt it was not really all that balanced. It was definitely more on the tart side and a bit difficult to drink without a chaser of either food or water. My husband ordered the vodka drink and it was 90% ice. Maybe save your money for drinks elsewhere before or after.   Service: 3 out of 5 Our server was really nice and attentive. The only thing that annoyed me was the way she handled a mixup with one of their drink specials. We went on a Tuesday night which is \"Betches be crazy\" night where (according to the menu) cocktails are $5 for women. So I ordered a cocktail. When the check came and my cocktail was charged at the normal rate of $14, I inquired. Without missing a beat she informed me that it was only one drink that qualified for that discount and that she had asked the bartender about that when she put my drink order in. Except that she neglected to come back and let me know that at the time. Instead she let me drink my full price cocktail, probably assuming she could pad the check and therefore her tip since it was a super slow night. But homie don't play that. The part that bothered me most about this when I told her the check was incorrect because I clearly thought it was part of the special, she just said \"oh no, that wasn't part of it\" and made no attempt to make up for it like asking the manager if they could adjust the price or make some other concession for the confusion.   Overall, I'd say check this place out but be super diligent about confirming specials and pricing especially if it's a slow night since that's apparently how they pad their tips.",

I'm also not sure how Mastros is even comparable. Had I known I was drinking a $20 martini, I may have asked one of the two employees working for a new one.  I do apologize for offending you Tommy.   We have been to Second Story a few times and I've always enjoyed the atmosphere and overall vibe they offer. We stopped in on Sunday evening with the intention of enjoying a few drinks before getting our date night started. I ordered a lemon drop martini with grey goose vodka and my husband ordered a whisky drink off the happy hour menu. The martini was small, extremely sour and lacked any real flavor other than lemon juice. It was not served with a lemon garnish or even lemon peel (sigh). Given the quality of the drink, imagine my surprise when I received the check and the martini was $20!!!! There are a lot of other options in old town that offer better craft cocktails at a more reasonable price.",

    "text": "I can think of so many better ways to spend $125 in an hour-and-a-half, but my husband has been wanting to try out this place for over a year. So, last night we tried it out and I think underwhelmed would be the best way to describe our experience.   We arrived with a reservation and the hostess seated us without menus. We waited so long to get menus, I actually thought about getting them myself or getting up and leaving. We finally got menus and I was struck by how out of place they were, considering the type of establishment this restaurant tries to be (upscale and chic). The menus are photocopies on extremely thin computer paper; the menus have been copied from copies so many times, you can barely read the descriptions of anything. The menu's font is also extremely small, making it even harder to read. Additionally, the menus are small cut-outs that look like they were cut by a toddler with scissors. It's a really strange presentation that doesn't match the price point of the food and cocktails.  After waiting for a really long time, we finally had our orders taken. The drinks were okay, but nothing special. We ordered an appetizer (Thai chicken lettuce wraps) and the chicken was so salty, I couldn't eat it. My husband agreed that there was entirely too much salt.  I ordered the scallops as my entree (chef's daily fish selection). My entree was $38, so I was expecting a lot of scallops. My plate had mounds and mounds of polenta (swimming in oil) topped with FOUR scallops, two SMALL yellow pattypan squash cut in half, and three over cooked broccolinis spears, all covered in tons of oil. There was so much oil, I actually took a spoon and started draining it off the food. I was extremely disappointed with how little food there was for the amount of money they were charging for the dish.  My husband ordered the brisket, chuck and short rib burger for $17. For $17, we expected fries to accompany the burger, but it didn't come with anything. My husband decided to order a side of fries ($7) because a burger isn't a burger without fries. I'm not going to lie; the burger meat was amazing! But, it had nothing on it except for aioli sauce, cheese and pickles. The sesame bun was super dry and stale; the burger would be much better if they used a moist brioche bun and added tomatoes and lettuce. The fries were very good and there were a lot of them; they reminded me of boardwalk fries. The only reason I'm giving this place two stars, instead of one, is because the burger meat and French fries were so good. The cost definitely wasn't justified, but at least they were tasty.  In the end, the bill was $100. For two cocktails, an inedible appetizer, an oily and small entree, a burger and fries, I did not feel like I got my money's worth. This is definitely a one-and-done experience. If I had to do it all over again, I only would have ordered the burger and fries and split it with my husband.  If you feel like you really have to try this place out, go during happy hour and be selective about your choices!",

The food was mediocre, the douchey EDM music was way too loud, and the place now feels like a wannabe club that happens to sell food.

We are absolutely understanding of this policy, but you must inform your customers first! No one likes to be surprised.  We tried several food items on the happy hour menu. I wish there was a more substantial vegetarian offering like their falafel. I ended up eating just biscuits and fries. The biscuits were outstanding, and the fries were very good. My husband got the burger and chorizo sliders. He liked both said the burger was his favorite.

I visited with a whiskey dude, and he was geeking out over the menu--there are some gems here to be had, but you should also know your bottles well, as he indicated the pricing was right on for many, a bargain for a few, and excessively overpriced on a handful. You bourbon boys and girls tend to know your stuff.  For me, it was about having an after-work unwind and catching up with a friend. We had just the right order of food, IMO. We got a half dozen oysters ($1 each during happy hour) and a big bowl of fries. Our server was speedy, not too chatty, and took good care of us while we sat and shot the breeze.  The spot is indeed a little swanky on the second floor. It's dimly lit and while cozy and intimate, didn't feel cramped. I dig it.  Our visit was limited, and obviously my non-drinking ways limit my usefulness here, but if you want to hit up a spot to have a seat, a sip, and a snack then the happy hour is where it's at.",

They have optional sitting, inside, outside of by the bar. We sat inside because we just went for a drink or two.   The ambiance is really nice it's more of speakeasy style, really dark in the inside but with beautiful candles and chandeliers.   They offer a really nice menu, I will make sure to try the food next time. I don't remember the drink I order but it was a sour drink it was Limon drink and it was super delicious.

    "text": "Located in the hustle and bustle of downtown Scottsdale, you are going to take in the sights and sounds. Easiest to park in the garage around the corner, you'll be happy to jaunt back after a night at SSLB. Great atmosphere and wonderful staff working together to ensure you have a fantastic experience. I've been here for a YEE event, restaurant week, happy hour and my birthday celebration. I probably come most for the whiskey and the WTF biscuits.   I will always crush on a swanky speakeasy vibe. Dimly lit for those awkward dates, but otherwise cozy and intimate for the rest of us, I am a big fan of the patio seating especially when it's spring in the desert. My most recent experience the staff was a stellar five stars. Both drinks and happy hour items were a little off but still tasty. Normally, I prefer the whiskey flight or a neat version of trouble otherwise known as scotch. Depending on your taste and budget, you can get a glass from $10-50. When it comes to scotch whiskey, age does matter. You'll want to be pick something like The Balvenie 21yr, Macallan 18yr, or the Lagavulin 16yr. Otherwise, stick to the cocktails and you'll get different stories to share and pretty much same alcohol happy.  Menu here is seasonal so you'll get different featured items depending what time you visit. Two of us ordered the French 75 and my other friend ordered the Moscow mule. Both seemed a bit tart but was relatively refreshing for the warm weather. A big hit was the WTF biscuits served with that umazing creme fraiche butter and fermented honey. We ordered the cauliflower and I'm undecided. Not sure if the raisins or the manchego, the taste seemed sourer and was hoping for more a roasted crunch. The pork belly is incredibly good. Just slather it on and you'll never leave SSLB. The spicy ahi tuna was accompanied by crispy rice cake and kimchi. Odd I know but I couldn't get enough of the crispy rice cake. If it is featured, always choose scallops. They are my litmus test on a restaurant besides steak. They do have a Tommy Hawk you can get for around $121 but I banned meat for now and had to abstain from my habit. The risotto that comes with the scallops is waistline killer and mouthwatering. Wednesdays are also $1 oysters while they last.   As Rick Chapman wisely said, a whiskey glass and a woman's arse are the downfall of many a good men. So what does ViVi say? The glass can be half empty or half full, as long as there's whiskey in it!",

I didn't realize they do dinner, but after looking at the dishes - definitely want to go back.  Libations: This place is known as an upscale cocktail lounge, Scottsdale definitely needs more of these places. I was in town to celebrate with some friends, so we stopped by to check it out and have a few drinks. A couple of dirty martinis and some bubbly, and we were in cocktail heaven.   With over 200 whiskeys, you can't go wrong here. They have seasonal menus throughout the cocktail year, but if you crave something not on the menu they say to just \"ask and we will go on a cocktail journey together\". Love that.   Overall experience: a little on the quiet side for 8pm on a Friday, but great super-dimmed ambiance and a speakeasy charm. Will have to go back for dinner and check out the eats.  Hours for easy reference: Mon/Tues: 4-10pm Wed/Thur: 4-11pm Friday/Sat: 4-2am Sunday: Closed  Happy Hour: Mon-Sat: 4-6pm Weekends: 11pm-1:00am",

    "text": "I love second story. Vibes vibe hard here.   If there is one thing that remains a constant in my life, its my deep, undying love for unconventional business entrances. So, obviously I appreciate how you check into second story outside down by a fire pit (which, upon a closer inspection, looks like an almost runic symbol set ablaze -- details like that speak to me) and then get led up the tight staircase into the swanky layout upstairs. Chandeliers, leather seats, dim lighting, wood accents, low ceilings; like I said, vibes vibe hard here.  This past weekend was my third time eating here. I have had the gnudi, the duck confit, and, most recently, the spicy tuna. All flame, all fire, all boom, all bam. Never been disappointed. Very tasty. One thing everyone absolutely needs to do -- order the fennel and brie fondue as a starter. Holy smokes, that is one of the best cheese appetizers I've ever had. Don't be an idiot. I am telling you how to be happy. I want you to be happy.   Anyways, I always recommend this place for date nights because, at least in my mind, its aesthetically romantic, yet it still has a nice energy to it -- unlike some romantic restaurants that feel more like stuffy, sterile mausoleums. That could just be a result of the people i've dated. No bad dates here though. Thanks Second Story.  Lastly, parking is really convenient here too because right on 3rd Ave there is the entrance to the free parking garage. Honestly tho, who even drives cars anymore? Bird is the future. Class dismissed. I love second story.",

She answered incorrectly and then went to go check and asked her manager to come back and tell us something totally different. I ordered the Gyro and the Charred Ceasar. My salad was forgotten and I had to remind the waiter, which had my still eating way after my friend had finished her meal. Had the service been better, it would've been a 4 star, but the prices not on happy hour are just ridiculous.",

John the bartender is extremely knowledgeable and passionate without the pompous and arrogant attitude of many so-called \"mixologists\" (anyone that calls themselves that are too cute by 1/2 for me, just make great drinks with quality ingredients and present them without the attitude please). It's dark in a good way with modern yet classic style, a great lanai that wraps around, and unique entrance. Most of all the staff and service stand out and the food is interesting and delectable. Some items are a bit too crafty for me but the selection provides many different options. Used to have a good happy hour but not last time I went (Oct 9). Plus I just found out John surfs! His travel pedigree allows for always interesting conversation but inquire about any bourbon topics and he will leave you educated and interested with enthusiasm and wisdom that's fun to gain.",

The dining room was still full, however the greeter informed us that there was three open seats at the bar. The restaurant at first glance is very intimate, great music and a lively atmosphere. We all sat down at the bar and was greeted by JT who guided us through the cocktail menu. As a bartender and server at another local fine dining restaurant in Scottsdale the bar is sophisticated and warm. Their bar is predominately a whiskey, bourbon and scotch bar (not a bad thing at all), however they have other spirits as well. I had the old fashion which was very good and was perfectly executed. My girlfriend had a glass of champagne and my best friend had a specialty cocktail called the commodore. This bar is not a run of the mill bar the bartenders are not bartenders they are mixologists. Alex and JT know their facts and are extremely knowledgable and love to educate anyone because of the passion they display for their craft. Along with their knowledge both Alex and JT were so friendly and we had such a great time chatting and conversing about different cocktails and liquids. The price point is perfect for the quality of service and quality of the cocktails. All three of us will absolutely be back again!",

    "text": "This week we decided to have our weekly happy hour at Second Story Liquor Bar, which had received some pretty great reviews on Yelp. At first glance this place looked great!  I really liked the indoor and outdoor seating, candle lights, and chandelier. There were only two small groups of people when we arrive at 6pm. It was not busy at all when we visited on a Wednesday night. We sat outside together because the weather in AZ this time of year is amazing! Once we sat down we were told that the current menu we were looking at was not current and that menus were being printed as we speak. The menu we had looked at was also different then the menu we saw online. This is definitely a $$$ not a $$ restaurant. We were then semi told verbally by the waitress what was on the Happy Hour menu. She left the table to get us water and none of us had a clue what was actually being served on the menu. Once she returned she brought a written list of what was going to be on the new menu. Very few food items were on the Happy Hour menu and none of their specialty drinks were on Happy Hour or less than $11 according to our waitress. Again, we didn't have a menu to verify anything. We ended up ordering a few mushroom flat breads that were good and called it a night. Service was quite poor compared to many local restaurants in the area. This place definitely has a nice inviting atmosphere at night with all of the candle lights. I wouldn't recommend this place for happy hour but I would possibly come back for a date night after 7pm just for drinks when you get a real feel of the atmosphere.",

The hostess Loren, wait staff Cara, manager and owner Tommy all greeted us at some point during the evening.  Cara was outstanding in presenting the menu and recommending foods to us. Definitely a place to return to.  The menu was interesting and the caesar salad and  salmon special were great.  Then on to the Gelato Spot for desert, just downstairs.  And that was equally as tasty.  We liked this place so much we came back the next night for pizza and more gelato downstairs.",

Great ambiance- modern and classy at the same time, with a bit of an old school twist. The food and cocktails were fantastic. I got the beet salad to start, which was very tasty, and then a stuffed chicken dish, which was equally good. They saved the best for last though, with a foie gras dish that was literally the BEST thing I've ever eaten. Anywhere. Ever. It even beat the foie at Babbo, Mario Batali's restaurant in NYC. Perfectly seared, creamy, delicious, paired with apples and cinnamon donuts. It was like a meaty dessert. I will honestly remember that dish for the rest of my life. Their cocktails were strong, creative, and tasty. The only slight negative was that service was pretty slow. Everyone was very friendly though. Can't wait to go back!",

My wife had the deconstructed king crab chowder. She couldn't be happier with big pieces of succulent crab with fried potato cakes among other wonderful pieces of goodness. For my second course, I had the smoke pork belly confit. I always  hear about this on the cooking show and had to give it a try. It didn't disappoint both of us (my wife was snacking on plate :) Absolutely wonderful with micro greens, gnocchi's, red wine demi glaze...oh sooooo good. My last course was the macadamian crusted sea bass. i was a little worried about this one because I never seem to get a good piece of fish no matter where I go....Well hold on to your hats, this place has the most tender and wonderful sea base. It literally melts in your mouth and the accompanying Asian risotto and baby bok choi took our breath away,  Daniella (our waitress) was phenomenal and took great care of us. We sat out on the balcony and soaked up the sites (first time visitor)  and sounds of Scottsdale My wife and I will definitely make it back to the SSLB.

I had made a reservation, thought I would go early to sit at the bar for a drink which was not happening.  Only 4 or 5 seats - Admittedly,  it was Saturday night and March.  We did go next door to that bar and have a drink there first.  It was also very crowded and that bar is quite large.  Back to restaurant- we sat on patio which is a very pleasant experience, quiet and cozy.    Our waitress was super sweet, but could of been a bit more attentive to details, no offer of the fish special or additional drinks.   The food was on par, better than typical restaurants in the area.   We had the chef's meat platter (would order again), burger (very good)  & pasta (good but not great)",

    "text": "First off I don't write reviews. But I enjoy great food and beverages but rarely am I going to spend the time to tell people I don't know about it. With that being said you occasionally have those experiences that blow you away. Tonight was one of those. I've had drinks before at second story and thoroughly appreciate their selection of whisky's and throwback ambiance. I've met the owner a few times and he's genuine and passionate and have even tried their food at a few events which led me to take my wife to dinner there tonight. The dishes were well thought out, seasoned perfectly and executed beyond compare. Every ingredient stood out but together they were exceptional. For a starter we enjoyed the biscuits with a seasoned butter, peach jam and whistle pig maple syrup. I don't think of crispy as a way to describe biscuits but it was extremely crispy and lite. I had the duck confit with broccolini, a jus or gravy of sorts and grits. Could not have been any better. The duck was crispy and moist. The broccolini was seasoned and cooked perfectly. The grits were different but great. And I wish I had more of that gravy. It was a contemporary take on a classic dish that I cannot be more complementary about. But I'm not sure if it was as good as the tuna dish my wife had. I've had seared tuna a thousand times and it's usually a staple dish at any decent restaurant. My 7 year old eats tuna sashimi 3 times a week. There's a reason it's overfished. If it's sushi grade it's really hard to screw up. But making tuna inherently different is a testament to a great chef. The rice and vegetables combined with the thin slices of radish and jalapeno seem simple but it was complex, every ingredient was in harmony with the next and it's just a sensational dish. We will be coming back soon. My only concern is how they can live up to what we just had. Again, I don't write reviews and most of the reviews I tend to read involve worst case scenarios but I felt it necessary to write about a best case scenario. If we go back and have a meal that's half as good as what we just ate I'd be plenty happy about the experience. They killed it tonight and I don't think this is a fluke. It was smart food prepared by passionate professionals and it showed. As a good friend from Mississippi used to tell me, \"It don't get no better than this, I'm just tryin to tell ya\".",

    "text": "My bestie treated me to Second Story for my birthday. We both agreed that we want more experiences as gifts. She found out about Second Story through Eater.com's 'Top 11 new places to try in Phoenix', (March 2016).  So out of a couple choices, I selected this place. We made reservations for 6:15 pm on Saturday. Good that we did, as there was a hostess outside. More for the later crowds and the unreserved. You climb a darkened, narrow staircase and turn to the right. A surprisingly cozy, lil speakeasy, whiskey bar and restaurant.  Waitresses are in lacy black tops and cute cocktail aprons with floral motif and pearls. Bar folk in button-down vests, ties, and nice slacks. Classy.  Our waitress was Jessica. She made great suggestions for appetizers to go with our drinks. It was National Bourbon month. We could try a flight of whiskeys. We opted for the handmade cocktails and sparkling water to sip and cleanse the palate. Gina had the French Revo. I had the Corpse Reviver. Our appetizers were the delicious beer bread made with porter stout and fresh butter with smoked salt. OMG! I could make French Toast with this stuff. Ladies at the next table saw how much we were enjoying the bread and the delectable crab cakes. They ordered a round for themselves.These were not crab cakes but more like crab hush puppy balls. Whatever the pastry was on the outside, it's French type the waitress said, it <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FMelted.In&s=3d46a8fdd9d44fac4e71262f19b55b2bbe0c072e4b148010f6c22ed7c3e7a8bb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Melted.In</a>. Your.Mouth. And left you to savor the fresh crab and such. It was served with a butter lettuce with roasted lemon foam dressing. It was like lemony sea foam. Again, we ate it with gusto.  On to our second set of cocktails and feeling great, the restaurant started to fill up quickly. Noise level wasn't too bad and we were enjoying the music in the background.  My friend Gina had the salmon with vegetables. I think there was an avocado crema on her dish.  The fish was delicious and fell apart with your fork. Another great recommendation by our waitress, I had the pan-seared duck (yummy) with forbidden dirty rice, parsnip puree, chive oil, glazed carrots. I had never had parsnips before. It was sooooo good. I loved the duck. We also ordered another round of that beer bread.   I think our total came to about $70 per person ( 2 apps, 2 meals, 2 breads, 4 cocktails)  before tax and gratuity. It was a great birthday present!!! We rolled out of there, fat and happy. We also walked down the street to the Old Town Scottsdale shops, to walk off the buzz for a couple of hours.  Definitely coming back here again!  It's just north of Indian School on Scottsdale road, sw corner above G-Spot.",

Since it's very small, they hold a charge on your credit card if  you cancel so make sure not to!

Upon one of our recent visits, and to our pleasant surprise, we ran into new operating partner Michael Bunker, who we got to know from his days at The Mission.  Michael's youthful looks and his exuberance in this new endeavor belie his food and beverage experience so we look forward to how he shapes Second Story.   Michael tells us the Second Story menu, which is influenced by Executive Chef Jason McGrath is evolving and will change regularly.  We really like this approach as it'll bring us back for more.  Some items featured during the recent Arizona Restaurant Week have made it to the regular menu.  Also, the emphasis on whiskey will evolve to a more well-rounded liquor menu.   A recent Saturday dining experience included the Blistered Shishito Peppers and Red Asparagus as our starters and we shared the Bison Burger and Flat Iron Steak.  5-stars all around.  I tried a new vodka cocktail that hit the spot.  Since my wife doesn't drink alcohol one of the servers named Bethany offered to have the bar create a fancy \"mocktale\", which she enjoyed.  If you're lucky enough to get Bethany or Lori as your servers, they will surely add to a great experience.",

There were pasta and burger options, but I wanted a protein focused dinner. My only option was the steak. I should have known better since the price wasn't listed. All other dishes were $20-30.  My steak came out cold and had no side dish (one mini carrot and two burned Brussels sprouts don't count!). It was a large size steak, but came out pre-sliced, which I find odd for a quality piece of meat. I was shocked when the bill came and the steak was $50! This doesn't even compare to other $50 steaks in Scottsdale, of which there are many options. Another person in our party ordered the burger, which was huge and I tried a friend's pork belly lettuce wraps, which were tasty. But another friend complained the \"pasta for two\" was only enough for one. My advice: go here for a cocktail and appetizer and go somewhere else for a solid meal.",

A group of work friends and I were strolling down the road, trying to find a place to get our dance on after a really dismal dinner and margarita experience at Salty Senorita. The hostess who sits on at the booth on the street right outside of the Gelato Spot entrance asked us if we wanted to come upstairs...Actually kind of creepy but we were into that I guess? Headed upstairs and the place is beautiful, this very James Bond M -esque woman, who is the owner or a manager greets us and she's accented and fabulous. The waitresses look so classy and librarian bombshell in lace dresses and long pearl necklaces. The bartenders wear untied bow ties...Ugh. This place makes me feel inadequate but I love it regardless.  So for my second dinner of the night, a co-worker split a burger with bacon jam and a too many good things to remember. The menu changes often though, themed on playwriting and storytelling. The menu is separated into categories like intro, prologue, plot, finale, etc. This place is fantastic and classy and a nice place to relax, have a drink or two and some fantastic food.",

I was really disappointed when our check arrived, nearly $80 for two appetizers and 3 drinks. The waitress popped us for $6 for water. Ok, it was \"sparkling\" and we got lime wedges. I believe that the upsell price should have been mentioned at the time it was offered. Also, they DO NOT honor their Yelp check in offer for $6 well drinks. My well drink didn't qualify because I asked for it to be on ice and that means it comes with more alcohol so they charged full price and refused to make the adjustment when I paid. Their $12 cocktails aren't very complex either. We won't repeat. Swing and a miss. Oh, and poutine is on pasta?  Chowder with no broth? Strange.",

She is so professional and personable and makes the experience better. Plus the interior has a great speakeasy feel with books and dark wood everywhere.

They serve whiskey cocktails, and many gin  prohibition- era cocktails that are authentic.  The mixology was awesome. I had corpse reviver - creme de violette-Cointreau- lillet. Also enjoyed French 75, and their rendition of the mule, all I can say is that the cocktails are very well made. Closest example I can think of is a chic-elegant-sexy restaurant in New York City.  We are foodies - the kind that will close our eyes and slowly chew to get a high off flavor and textures. Servers were dressed in theme reminding me of the prohibition era. Sarah was our server the first night and Laurie the next night - consistency is key and they have nailed it.  ( You must check out the restrooms- very cool- can't tell you why cause it will be a spoiler)   Food: The vegetables were fresh and seemed like they'd just been plucked. This chef is a genius. The flavor, textures, visual appeal are outstanding and thoughtful. He combines ingredients to bring out rich notes in the food. The menu is adventurous but at the same time very approachable and most importantly - delicious.  Can't go wrong.  Must have the noble bread burrata- indulgent as was panzanella. Dandelion gnocchi was unlike any, very light, cardamom crusted duck was almost too pretty to eat.  The menu changes seasonally.  Depending on what time you arrive you may see a regular dinner menu or a late night menu both are fantastic and are different in that there is very little overlap in the dishes between the two menus. We got there on Thursday night after the dinner menu was closed so it was the late-night menu.  The manager (Mike) is the nicest guy. We loved the food and ambiance so much and were sorry to have missed the dinner- we said we wanted to come in again- he promised us a table the next night (jazz night). We mentioned we were fans of pisco sour and he made sure to specially get pisco just for us. I can't remember a time where the food, cocktails, staff and ambiance were all this good.",

    "text": "We went here for my friends birthday dinner. She is extremely picky, so choosing a restaurant for her elevated taste was concerning. Luckily i relied on Yelp and found this gem.  The food is FANTASTIC. I tried a bit off of everyone's plate. And the drinks were fun and unique. I would comment on what we ordered but.. the menu changes every 3 months. So  go in for yourself and try, best idea if you are not on a budget is to sample from their menu. They have a course meal deal ($60 i believe) and you can try different parts of their menu.  Such a great experience!",

    "text": "I have nothing but good things to say about this place.  The owner was outside to show us how to get up to the bar, and made sure we were seated promptly. The inside of this place was such a cool vibe! Very speak-easy kind of feel with a big, beautiful chandelier in the middle of the room. Our waitress was on-point with her knowledge of the menu, and gave great recommendations that we all were thankful we took! On top of that, the pace of the meal was great. She came to check on us just right amount of times, and never when our mouths were full (you know that moment when your server asks how your food is, but your mouth is so stuffed with it all you can do is make weird hand gestures and nod your head?)  The food was superb. There was some kind of celery root mash with my meal that you would honestly believe was real mashed potatoes!  Finally, dessert was phenomenal. They didn't have a dessert menu yet, but our server told us that the chef was trying out a strawberry shortcake kind of thing if we wanted to try it. Boy are we glad we did!! Our recommendation for the chef was to put that dessert on the menu as fast as possible because it was insane!  Oh yes, and the owner came up toward the end of our meal, just to OUR table, to see how everything was for us and thank us for coming. I don't think I've ever felt so special at dinner!  If that's not a 5 star experience I don't know what is. Definitely coming back.",

    "text": "This is a really neat different kinda spot. I was pretty excited to check it out last week.  The vibe is nothing like anything you will find in Oldtown, and I hope it stays that way. Very small but the patio over looking Scottsdale is money! Great idea.  Our waitress had the cutest outfit on-the staff all wore lace dresses. She was very informative about the restaurant, food & drinks.  We had the lobster roll & their well known burger - I was sold on the mozzarella pattie that was on the burger! The lobster roll was disappointing, the bread was cold and hard :/  Burger was on point thou!  The drinks were very slow. And service to receive them became even more slow as the night went on :/ Yes, we started with some craftier drinks offered on their menu but a round  beers were taking about 12-15 mins to get to us. And not to mention, beers were not cold :/   We lost the waitress we started with and the English /british manager did chat with us and was very charming- but only thinking she was like that to cover the fact the bartenders were not up to speed or they are too busy to handle the crowds needs? My group was not impressed waiting a long time for beers.  So, funny story. I was in line for the bathroom and a girl came out , wide eyed- and said \"beware of the bathroom, it's very republican!\" So I entered very alarmed and confused and heard Paul Harvey speaking instead of regular typical music ! It made me laugh! Typical Scottsdale bar goers are not going to understand such a different thing haha! But I thought it was amusing..and it a little creepy! Lol!  Over all it's beautiful and so different ! I want to give 3.5 stars- but if I go next time - my group is going to have to be extra patient waiting on drinks..which doesn't make a Friday night fun. Hope- they improve this asap!",

The appitizers are imaginative and great.  The name of this place emphasizes liquor, but I don't see that as the highlight.  This is a gourmet restaurant.

The dinner menu is fairly robust and the drink menu is extensive!  No deserts, but it's not needed since they are right below the best gelato in Scottsdale!",

The bar is right above the Gelato Spot (no you can't bring your Gelato in, they are not affiliated). The appetizer menu is okay, but don't come too hungry-it's not really about the food. Most of the drinks here are Whiskey based. They have a great selection on the Whiskeys, plus some wine/beer and a few other liquor mixed drinks thrown in. Prices range from $14 cocktails to $100 on the higher end Whiskeys glass. Service is fast.   Mary Kate at the front door is sweet and will get you setup! No reservations necessary.",

Then we were led upstairs and the place was empty which was super confusing. We sat outside as there were 6 of us, and our server brought us complimentary rose which was sweet, but then we didn't see her, for 20-25 minutes at a time and the place was literally empty.   We ordered the bride a fun drink and it was literally the worst thing I've ever tasted, tried another and same thing so we finally gave up and tried to cash out but couldn't find our server again.

The restaurant wasn't full but the staff was very busy. The decor is cool and comfortable. I don't eat meat so my options were very limited. I ordered the falafel shared plate. It's was good. My hubby had the Thai chicken wraps, Peppers and the burger with fries. He enjoyed all his food. I tried a couple of fries and they were good. I did ask our server if the chef was willing to make a vegan dish and she wasn't sure. I guess she couldn't ask. She did recommend a pasta dish that is vegetarian. Ugh!   There was a chopped salad option but I eat enough salads at home.  I rarely have a glass wine but I ordered the Rose from the Happy Hour menu. My husband enjoyed his Manhattans. This place definitely rocks out the cocktails. I would return if my husband wanted.",

    "text": "You wouldn't know it by just the name, but this place is more than just a full service liquor bar. It's a gourmet dining experience with an abundance of decadent flavors. The ambiance is so unique, upscaled and refined, yet relaxed. I felt like I was in a scene from The Great Gatsby, shelves adorned with mini wooden barrels, alcohol regalia, comfortable seating, and a beautiful chandelier. It reminded me of a smaller version of Beauty and Essex in NYC. Even when I was in the bathroom, I was captivated by the stories of Paul Harvey.   Service was spot on thanks to Bethany. There were three of us and we each considered doing a tasting menu, but she suggested that we order more plates so that we could get more variety and save some money. Mind you, everything is fairly priced and worth every penny. What a great recommendation because there was not a dish that we did not love!   Now onto the food!  Social Plates: 1. Beer Bread: Our plate was presented to us with 6-8 pieces of delicious chunks of warm, savory bites and the house made churned butter was revealed with the lift of a small glass dish releasing a swirl of smoke.   Opening Fare: 2. Seasonal soup: Jalapeno soup: It was just the perfect amount of froth and such an original taste with a spicy kick. We have never had anything like it and wished we had some more beer bread to dip in it.  3. Roasted little gem salad: The texture was on point, beautifully plated, and refreshing.  4. Corned pork belly: I loved the pork belly spaeztle combination.  5. Foie gras: Last year, one of us had a bad experience when trying foie for the first time. However, this plate changed his experience and now he has a greater appreciation for properly prepared foie. All the components were perfectly selected for this dish. It is not easy to properly prepare foie and I applaud the chef for executing such a fantastic dish.  5. Ahi tuna (Hamachi crudo-unavailable): We did not mind the tuna substitution. The delicately sliced pieces of tuna were fresh and worked so well with the radish and sauce.  6. Whole grain gnocchi: The perfectly al dente gnocchi worked harmoniously with the pieces of tender brisket.   Dinner Fare: 7. Pan seared duck: The rich bold flavors of the duck blew us away.   8. Coffee charred venison: It's understandable to be intimidated by the name of this dish as venison is deer and can taste gamey if not properly prepared. However, we were all impressed by how it was exquisitely prepared. It tasted more like filet mignon rather than venison. And the wild boar bacon, wow!  9. Salmon (Wild striped bass-unavailable): Again, we did not mind the salmon substitution. The salmon was so delicious including the skin. Combined with the spaghetti squash and ponzu broth, the flavors and textures were just spectacular!   Sweet side: 10. Banana foster bread pudding: Scrumptious and paired with burnt popcorn ice cream. Yum!  11. Chocolate beignets: Definitely way better than Cafe Du Monde beignets! There are 5 pieces that come with the order along with a generous dollop of freshly made cream.   12. Cappuccino: A perfect cap to the end of dinner keeping you from falling into a sleep coma from all the astounding dishes!  Nick the chef is absolutely incredible and talented! Super down to earth and friendly, he came out to chat and to share some stories. He mentioned that the menu changes every ~4-6 weeks. Thank you again for such a special and unique experience! Our bellies are growling with anticipation for the next time!",

    "text": "Outstanding all around - great drinks, awesome service, and delicious food. Took my husband here for a casual dinner out before his bigger holiday surprise. We decided to split a burger, fries, the crispy pork belly lettuce wraps, biscuits, and finally the banana's foster bread pudding. 'Twas a carb-fest and it was worth it. For me, the burger and the pork belly were the stars for the food - Burger was perfectly cooked and everything an elevated classic should be. Bonus of dining with my husband is that I got all the excellent pickles as he hates them! The crispy pork belly lettuce wraps with spicy sauce and a little bit of kimchi WERE SO GOOD. I would happily eat a pile of the crispy pork until I perish. Fries and biscuits were also truly great - the dessert was okay verging on good and unexpectedly giant. Would love to see some more bread-free options on the food side to be able to sample more when I'm not totally compromising on my usual eating habits. For drinks, we tried the house Sazerac (best I've had in AZ), the Boulivardier (my husband loves them and I just can't get on board with the Campari aftertaste, but all things considered was very good), the Old Fashioned (with a very spicy rye), plus some of the Buffalo Trace Wheller 12yr. We have plans to go back soon with friends and family who love bourbon and whiskey either to lounge inside in the comfy booths or people watch on the outside balconies. Plus, you can sample a ton of things for their stellar happy hour specials. Ah, crispy pork belly wrap and a Sazerac, I shall be back for you soon...",

    "text": "Where is the 2nd Story Liquor Bar?! Ahh yes...up on the 2nd floor next to the Gelato Spot! Reserved for a table of 9 the hostess brought us upstairs to the 2nd floor where a huge chandelier hung above a table for 2. Booths and tables all around and a bar at the top. A server immediately asked if we have been here before and educated us of their drinks, as well as recommended a couple drinks. Good job. And then came back with waters.   This place has a few of the \"weird\" plates that the general crowd will not normally eat so I of course had to go for it!   Social Plates:  - Bone Marrow - this in hindsight is one of the peasant part of the cow...the throw away parts you throw as a treat for your dog - but is becoming the beginning attraction of the show. With a bit of decoration to liven the dish it becomes a beauty to devour. The bone marrow - which is high in fat- is eaten like a spread over some toasted buttered bread and garnished with some baby fennel dressed in red vinegarette, literally a couple micro cress, garlic-grape marmalade. The combination of everything jammed like jelly. $16.   Opening Fare: - Foie^2 - this is the cold strawberry-like pate and a little fatty sac atop the same rectangle buttered toasted bread, cranberries, barley smacks (which I didn't think go well with the dish) (there was no Brie and no winter squash and I received the white bread instead of the brioche).The dish was very odd as if they didn't have all the ingredients listed on the menu- but was at least presented and hidden well. $23  Dinner Fare: -Chicken Fried Brisket- a fried battered large square cube of the beef brisket was deep fried with a side of horseradish mashed potatoes, shallot gravy, baby white and yellow carrots and broccoli. I liked the presentation of this dish especially with the cubed fried brisket. $25  Sweet Side: -Banana Foster Bread Pudding - bread pudding with ice cream and coin pieces of banana $10  Cocktail:  - Corpse Reviver - a citrus like drink. $13  Too bad they were out of the bass and only had salmon. Overall the dinner was likable but a few ingredients were missing. Water was not there after the first glass was given. I give this a 3.5 stars but will bump it up due to half stars.",

I recommend the patio for people watching on the street below. Overall ambiance is great.  Menu is limited to 6-8 items plus a daily special fish. I have had the daily special several times and it has never disappointed me. I have also tried their other entrees and they have been very good. I think the short menu is a good thing but check it out first if you're an picky eater.   Whiskey selection is decent with 20-30 options available on the menu. Evidently I have missed the back bar where they have a much bigger selection beyond just what is on the menu ; ) Had an old fashioned to try their cocktails. It was a fine example of an old fashioned.",

Loved the atmosphere - string lights, good people watching from the upstairs wrap-around patio, and happy bartenders.   Will be back!",

The restaurant is upstairs from a pizza spot, once inside there is an intimacy here where it feels like you can just chat with your neighbor at the next table. I sat at the bar and did that very thing. Also, if you are a fan of whiskey or bourbon, they have some very good options. I highly recommend trying the old fashion.",

Kanye West & Paul McCartney - Four Five Seconds)  I think I've had enough I might get a little drunk I say what's on my mind This place brings me back in time Cause all of my reviews Is singing for Yelpers  Now I'm Yelping Second Story Liquor Bar! And I got 5 more stars till Friday I'm just trying to munch and write by Monday morning I swear I wish somebody would tell me Ooh, that's all I want  This place is totally cute and sauve. I came here with my Yelp friends after a party with the gang.  Second Story Liquor Bar is on the 2nd floor obviously and almost felt like a speakeasy as we climbed the stairs.  There was a band playing some jazz while you can hear murmurs among the crowd.  It was dark indeed.  As we sat we all ordered a cocktail to start.  They had some old fashion cocktails from the hey days of the 20s and 30s, but also some modern takes on some of them.  For our food I went for the Cockles & Mussels; a saffron tomato broth with a polenta base while the cockle clams and mussels were littered around.  Overall, definitely a cold weather bite since it helped warmed the soul.  My friends ordered the Buttermilk & Teff Pasta and the Foie Gras.  I had a bite of the teff pasta and thought it freshly made, but very clean and it gave me a healthy feel.  The star of the night for me was the Foie Gras; beautifully plated with a towering milk bread with toasted coconut and passion fruit.  The duck was cooked to perfection with a light toasty crunch shell.    Overall, I like Second Story Liquor Bar because the ambiance is very chill and a place I can definitely hangout for a drink or two.  The food is unique and presented very well.  In the end, this is my new ace! - Enjoy!",

After a couple bites I experienced an allergic reaction - thankfully not too severe - and alerted staff. Waitress insisted that no nuts were in my food despite my reaction and proceeded to charge me for the meal I barely touched. When I inquired why I was being charged the waitress informed me that because the chef claimed there were no nuts in my food I still had to pay and implied that my reaction might be fake in order to get a free meal. Perhaps there was something in my meal that was an unknown allergy, but I without a doubt was experiencing a scratchy tongue and throat and stomach pain that was only alleviated with an allergy pill. I told the waitress that I had 2-3 bites and did not finish my meal or my glass of wine. Waitress spoke to her manager, and finally fixed my bill. No apology. No visit from the manager. I was offered to order something else on the menu but I wonder if they would have charged me for both entres seeing as they wanted to charge me despite my allergic reaction and touching far less than half the plate. Wanted to enjoy the evening with friends and left completely disappointed.",

The pork was perfectly seasoned.  The crispy rice added a crunchy contrast to the poke. The octopus came out on a bed of beans with veges, and was perfectly cooked and tender.   The real gem was our server, Kaylin.  She was extremely knowledgeable about both the drink and food menus.   She recommended the Velvette Reveler (a gin drink) for me and a Street Fighter (mescal-based and not even on the menu) for my husband.  Absolutely fantastic!  I would definitely recommend this place to friends, family, and anyone visiting Scottsdale.",

The cocktail I ordered was strong, measured, and delicious.  Our Waitress was nice, she got the job done but left us alone, which for the most part is the problem as it took forever to get service once we were seated and then once we ordered our cocktails they took forever to arrive.  The bar only had two bartenders, and although quite skilled based on how good my Rye Be So Serious was, and the complexity of the What's Up Doc my girlfriend ordered.  They were either slow or slammed which is where I don't like being left alone, I want information so I can calculate my next move.  Following that you find yourself heading restroom and listening to NPR as you reflect on where the night is taking you.",

    "text": "We tried this place for restaurant week. I had my eye on this place for a while and it happened to show up on the list of restaurants. Definitely worth it!   First off the environment/ambiance of the place is hottt! Waitresses are all beautiful and the dim lighting along with the relaxed lounging sitting makes for a very intimate /romantic experience. The customer service is great and I hand get even gotten to the food! So not only is the place/environment amazing...the food and drinks are awesome!  So let's get to the food and drinks right? That's why you guys are reading this . First off their menu had creative titles so that was an impressive start! Well our choice of drinks tonight were the bright and sunny & the coconut and chill. The drinks are described in detail in the pictures I provided. I will admit the drinks are pricey but where are they not with higher quality liquor and a boujee place to drink. They were 14 a piece! Ouch! So I was hoping they had a bite to them and weren't highly diluted with froufrou stuff! The drinks didn't disappoint ! Flavorful but with a bite!   Next we tried the wtf biscuits with fermented honey! Totally worth it!! Outside biscuit just a touch of crisp flakiness with the inside being soft and warm to the taste with a touch of honey not overpowering it! Mmmmmm!   Next was the appetizers! I got the goat cheese ancini with pea and carrot puree. Absolutely delicious . Goat cheese is a hit or miss with me. Sometimes tastes too strong and goat like lol. This one was perfect and delicious! My boyfriend got the baby gem with green goodness dressing. Mehhh...it was the only thing the whole night that was not impressive. Typical salad. So I don't recommend that.   Next the entree!! We both chose the coconut caramel short ribs with bok choy with 5 spices. YUM! Small proportion I will admit but was still delicious. I'm not a big fan on the spice anise so that would throw me off at times. My boyfriend enjoyed it all!   Finally the dessert!! Had with plum upside down cake with cream friache and orange zest. Delicious pleasurable treat! I already know I like upside down pineapple cake and this creative spin on it did not disappoint! Every bite delicious!   The experience was worth it! Pricey, yes! But the environment, food, customer service amazing and worth it for a treat here and there! So now go try it! Especially if you get a chance during restaurant week!",

The waitress was accommodating of my drink requests, & gave great food suggestions. Now I have to talk about the pork belly sliders. I am not sure if they are just a happy hour item or not, but they are amazing. My friend & I, but probably more me, were actually making sounds when we ate them. You know that thing you did when you were a kid, & the food was so good you made noises? Those pork belly sliders are amazing.  So come here for the pork belly sliders, & then have some great drinks. I will definitely be back for more. I heard there may be a new chef, so that may be the reason the food is now really great. I need to try more of the menu for sure. My only negative is that they are not open on Sundays, which is a day I love to go for food & drinks in the afternoon, but I'll live.",

There is usually a hostess to greet you at street level and escort you upstairs for drinks, bites and/or dinner. It's really a unique experience for Old Town.",

    "text": "While I've not dined in every restaurant in the Valley, this is by far the best place I've eaten in!    My friend and I shared the birch bread which we both agreed was fantastic especially because of the green super butter (heck, if you're gonna eat butter, might as well be a little healthier than usual).  The elderberry and peach jam was a bit floral though very nice.   Next, I had the frisee salad which was likewise delicious, dressed with this tangy green apple vinaigrette.  You might think at this point that I like veggies, but you would be wrong (read on); only when they are doused in some tasty dressing and accompanied by some animal product, in this case, lardon and crispy egg, would I dare to enjoy a salad.   So, onto a meat entree (you knew that was coming):  the bison burger--and with its layers of cheddar, mesquite onion, garlic aioli, and granny smith apple was the BEST bison burger I've ever had.  With its lower fat content, it's not easy to make a supple bison burger, but this chef obviously knows what he's doing.   My cocktail, Every Rose Has Its Thorn (yes, that's right, a play on the Poison song), was pretty good.  I will have try some of their other creative concoctions.  My friend is a bourbon connoisseur and was pleased with the varied selections.    The only misstep was the dessert.  The apple cobbler was too sweet--and I do like sweet desserts.  But, this does not overshadow how great the meal was.   Our server, Beth, was very sweet and personable.  Indeed, all the staff was pleasant.   This restaurant is on par with any great desirable restaurant in NYC, so we are very fortunate in Scottsdale to have this terrific place, with its Southwestern inspired cuisine and cool ambience.",

I was searching for a great place for a group dinner because my bff was coming to visit from out of town. I was pleasantly surprised to find this amazing place on yelp.  Inside has a roaring 20's theme. The cocktails were delicious and unique. I should have written this sooner because I forgot what I ordered, but it was a champagne cocktail, something different. The food was delicious. I had a seabass slider and the caprese salad. The menu changes every six weeks, but some items are frequently available.  The huge chandelier overlooking Gelato Spot was a photo favorite.   The service was great, especially since our party of 9 arrived in small groups of 1-3.  If you are coming with a group, I definitely recommend making a reservation.  I look forward to going back on a date, for gno, or with friends.",

While I was every excited to try Second Story, I was reluctant to bring everyone here because I was sure that no matter how great this place was, SOMEONE was going to hate it. Well, hell has literally frozen over because all 6 of us left, utterly happy and amazed with our experience.  This small, cozy spot has a cool, sexy speakeasy vibe with a nice little bar and a few tables some of which overlook the pizza joint below. They have a rotating menu but I was able to enjoy one of the best caprese salads I've ever had with smooth, light mozzarella, tangy pesto and delicious greens and tomatoes.  For my main, I had the filet, which served up a tender and succulent medium rare, and accompanied with scalloped potatoes, carrot frites and grilled vegetables. I also got to try some of the the stellar buttermilk fried chicken. I'm not a lamb eater but the most critical eater in our group thoroughly enjoyed the lamb so if that's not a raving endorsement, I don't know what is.  Our gorgeous servers were gracious and attentive, their hand-crafted cocktails were amazing and the atmosphere was sexy and classy. This is hands down one of the best discoveries I've made in a while and it's all thanks to Yelp.  I can't recommend this place enough-great for a date night or for a group.

I ordered a traditional sazerac and what I got was basically a glass of sugar. Will not be back, this place is a total bust. Will go to bitter and twisted instead, they actually know how to make a good cocktail!",

It definitely has a cool vibe to it.  If you're looking for a place to enjoy a cocktail with a date, I think this is a good choice.  If you're looking for a fun bar with great food/drink specials, I would go elsewhere.  Prices are steep, especially for the food.  We tried the fried chicken, and the size was laughable for $20.  But then again, that's likely because we came in thinking \"liquor bar,\" not \"fancy restaurant.\"  I may return for a drink, and now that I understand better what it's all about, I might enjoy it more.  But hey, that's what Yelp is for.  Know before ya go!",

For being as small as the space is they really aren't in your face making you feel uncomfortable/awkward which is hard to accomplish and also highly desired when your looking for a new place to go. \"Just enough\" was the key to making the night wonderful, delightful and memorable. The bartender (who's name is escaping me ATM dammit!!) was great. And that coming from a someone who has been in the industry is saying a lot.  The food was A-M-A-Z-I-N-G a sim not just saying that. When your considering picking up the plate and licking it you know that shit was the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. I had the old fashion which was executed quite well with angostura bitters pushing it that much closer to my heart. I also had the tacos Jalisco mule , minus the tacos. It was delicious and I even got my step mom to try and she was impressed.   The whole experience was one that dreams are made of and I really hope they stay busy and stick around. Furthermore I hope they become a staple in the old town district.  Yum",

Everything from the Decor to the menu to the extensive liquor list is thoroughly thought out and perfectly executed.   I would recommend this as a date spot and not as a spot to attend with large groups of friends. It works better with parties of 4 or less. The food is phenomenal. I ordered the 5 course dinner with the Inside Out Caprese, The Venison, The Sea Bass and two other things that were phenomenal (I can't remember because at that point the Whiskey kicked in.) I made loud noises every time I took a bite.   Also it is important to note that not only is the food outstanding, but they have an impressive wine and liquor list. I think the waitress said they had 70 different kinds of whiskey. I ordered the Commodore which was a mixture of Whiskey Lime & Lemon and it was out of this world.   If you are taking your girl on a date go here!",
