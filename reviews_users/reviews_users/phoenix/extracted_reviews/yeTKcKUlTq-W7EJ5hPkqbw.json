I frequently get the wedge and just love it, it is always good.  Service at lunch is excellent, fast and efficient.  Steaks sometimes aren't exactly how you ordered them, but the kitchen will happily correct it to the appropriate temp/doneness.  Highly recommend for lunch at this location, they do such a good job.",

I like to come here when a nascar driver wins a race because you can sometimes get a free appetizer.  When I come, I usually get steak, but I don't find it as flavorful as other steak places that have it for the same price.  I also did not find their lobster tail that flavorful either.  The couple of times I ate here with friends, my steak did not come out how I ordered.  I usually order a medium rare, and they make it medium.  However, I do believe they have the best blooming onion though!  That is very flavorful, but make sure you share with someone as it has alot of oil and salt. The service in this location is great though!",

I'm a vegetarian going to a steakhouse and a chain steak restaurant at that!  But \"allegedly\" they had this onion thing that I just \"had to try\".  Our waiter was cute, attentive and made great suggestions.  The bread was actually really good and on this day they were giving out a free Bloomin' Onion per table!  Ok ,so the onion thing was surprisingly good, a little greasy, but good.  I ordered the chicken artichoke flatbread sans chicken with a side order of sweet potato.  My friends had the soup of the day (potato) and the Aussie chicken Cobb Salad sans bacon.   We all liked our food and everything was cool.",

    "text": "Odd food experience with this place. I tend to avoid chains in general and follow the Yelp reviews but was out with my parents (who are in the senior citizen category of life, and they wanted to go because you got a free blooming onion when you ordered an entree (or maybe two, I don't know), and my mother had a coupon for $4 off when you order two entrees. So, we went, and not a fun eating experience, and here is why.  First, the blooming onion, and I realize it was free, was half cooked. About half of it was not edible. I haven't had one before but my mother noted that they were usually much better. I was like 'it's free, who cares?\" - but it was indicative of other events in the dining experience.  Second, parents wanted to split an  entree and salad and were specific on the salad (no croutons, extra cucumber), ended up getting a split salad with croutons and without the cucumber addition - the waiter came over and even noted that they seemed to have gotten the wrong salad (who knows, maybe someone else split a salad)? Then the entrees we ordered came out later than at least one other table, even though they had come in at least 10 to 15 minutes later. I had a steak salad and my parents split a cheeseburger so not sure why the orders ended up, well, out of order.  Finally, even though my parents had noted they were doing the blooming onion and the coupon, when the waiter (Brian) brought the bill, he said the manager would not allow my parents to do both the free blooming onion and the coupon for $4 off. Now, I understand the idea but my parents had been quite open in their intentions before ordering. I ended up speaking to the manager (Lorenzo), who initially said he could not put both in the system and I had to point out that my parents had openly noted they were doing both and that would have been the time to explain how things  work, not when the meal was over.  Okay, I don't want to paint a broad brush on Outback, I've eaten at other locations in the past and have been more than fine with the experience, and they look like, as others have pointed out, that they do make some great drinks. In addition, my steak salad was quite good. I would happily have it again. Hey, I'd even go back and eat at the bar. I'm just saying that this specific experience was not a good one. Who knows, I may find myself at the bar, having one of those interesting cocktails and end with a much better review.",

    "text": "We came here for our anniversary dinner Wednesday evening after receiving a gift card from my boss & his wife. We hadn't eaten at an Outback Steakhouse in years and never at this location, which is near our home although a bit off the beaten track. While the first hostess we encountered was quite unfriendly with an attitude that seemed to be discouraging us and other diners from waiting the estimated 15-20 minutes to be seated, and she was later very unsympathetic after she seated a family with 3 noisy young children next to us when we'd conveyed that we would appreciate having a peaceful anniversary meal near other adults, Christy (acting as another hostess and perhaps a member of management?) and our server, Alex J, totally saved the day and our happy occasion. They were both awesome and personable, and they seemed to really care that we had a great anniversary dining experience. I had twin lobster tails with mashed potatoes and asparagus, and everything was prepared perfectly. I was actually amazed at how moist and flavorful the steamed lobster was, and the asparagus was great, too - neither overcooked nor undercooked. My husband had a filet with coconut shrimp, a Caesar salad and sweet potato, and he loved every bite. The salted caramel cheesecake we took home with us was to die for, so I'd highly recommend ordering it.  Again, Christy and Alex J went above and beyond to make this a pleasant dining experience for us. Thanks to them, we'll definitely be back.",

That is not what the menu states.  If it is optional, then it should state that in the description.  The waiter was very kind and quickly made sure I got the veggies.  But makes me wonder how many other customers did not get veggies when ordering this entree.  Their menu needs to be a bit clearer.  Might have given it 5 stars if not for this small hiccup.",

Next, I've lived on both coasts and miss the days when lobster tails were the size of your forearm, mine was the size of my thumb. I kid you not.

The server was also nice and was attentive to the table. I ordered their Cobb Salad and a side of Mac and Cheese. The Mac and Cheese was really good I would definitely recommend trying. However, the Cobb Salad was not good. Firstly the presentation was terrible and looked like they used a bag of salad from Fry's and dumped it in the bowl. I honestly could have made the same thing at home. I also didn't realize until I had already left that they forgot to put egg on the salad. Coming from the service industry I know it shouldn't be hard to mess up a salad at a \"steakhouse\", so I'm definitely disappointed.   I would say if you are to eat at Outback DO NOT order a salad, they look and taste like something you can make yourself.",

    "text": "This review is based solely on the lack of customer service at this location.   We'd planned for days to have an early family dinner out on Saturday. We arrived a bit after 4 pm. We walked in and the young man at the host's podium did not look up nor did he greet us. Well,ok, maybe you're new and don't know how to appropriately greet your customers. He told us it was going to be 5 to 10 minutes of a wait. We looked around and the restaurant was barely full at that hour. Why the wait?  Very curious. As we moved toward the seating, I thought it was odd that the rude host didn't even bother to ask our party's name or the number of people who were dining. My husband went back to the podium to give him our names and again, no eye contact from the host and a mumble that he didn't need it. Again, very strange.  The host seemed immersed in his work of some kind; reviewing a chart over and over. Come on!  If you're the host, do your job!    While my husband and son used the restrooms (which they reported were gross and smelled of urine) I sat there getting more miffed by the second. Why should I give this place my hard earned money? No way. I decided we were leaving.   On our way out the manager opened the door for us and thanked us for coming. Hah!  I asked him if he was the manager and he said he was. I promptly told him that the host was rude and recounted the story. It appeared as if he was going to reprimand the offender but guess what?  We did not receive an apology from the manager. That is the very least he should have done. It starts from the top down and I know who the main culprit is.  I've decided to never go to this chain again! Ever!  Get your team together manager or this location is doomed.",

    "text": "Goodness what a long dinner and not in a good way. My boyfriend and I went to dinner here because we had some gift cards from the holidays. We got seated in a booth which I was happy about and the waitress came pretty quickly to take our order so I though things were going to be super easy peasy for dinner.   They had a valentine's day special going on, which included the blooming onion, 2 entrees, 2 sides each, 2 side salads, and cheesecake for dessert for $42. We decided that was pretty good deal and ordered it as well as the valentine's day special drink, the love potion. This drink was super good. It was not too sweet and had a really good fruity flavor to it.   The drink came out almost immediately, so again I was thinking dinner service was going to be on point. The blooming onion came out shortly after with no salads so I thought those were coming out later before dinner. The blooming onion was good. The breading was crispy and very seasoned and the sauce that came with it helped balance out the seasoning. Without it, the blooming onion may be a little too salty, but who eats it without the sauce anyway? Once we finished the blooming onion we sat there for quite a bit of time before our waitress came over to see if we needed anything. I asked her if we could maybe have our side salads since dinner was talking a little long. She told me we had the option to pick between the 2 sides or the side salads. I told her no I'm pretty sure it's both. (I even check on the way out to make sure I was right, which I was I am never wrong when it comes to reading the menu.) She then continued on that I was wrong, so I decided not to argue with her. Then, I kid you not, we waited 30 minutes before our steaks came out.   The steaks weren't really charred, but to the point of burnt and thankfully still (mostly) medium rare in the middle. I personally like the taste of burnt, but I think I can say that most people do not like that. My boyfriend, for example, would be one of those people, but asking for a different steak would have possibly taken another 30 minutes to come out. For sides, we ordered the mashed potatoes, the baked sweet potato, and upgraded to the asparagus and mac and cheese. We obviously shared all of the sides. All the sides were decently good, with the mac and cheese being my favorite of the 4. I felt like the cheesiness was what I needed to help with the overall saltiness of the steak and asparagus. I have no comments about the side salad since I never received it. I can't imagine I would have had an critiques about it though.   When we were done eating, it took us another 30 minutes before we were able to sign our receipt slip and finally leave. We were literally sitting there waiting. We weren't talking, still eating, or making it seem like we wanted to be there for any longer than we needed to be. I don't know whose fault it was that dinner took so long... whether it was that the kitchen lost our ticket, messed up our order and had to redo it, or the waitress completely forgot to put our order in. I don't know but I could tell the waitress was feeling pretty pressed about how long we were waiting for food. She was very nice, but I wish she would have told us what was up. I also don't know why it took so long to run our gift card and credit card.   All I know is Outback Steakhouse owes me 2 side salads and at least an hour of each of our lives back. I was super not happy about this trip at all.",

    "text": "Outback seems to be shifting into less of a nice chain dinner stop into a more expensive version of Applebee's. My wife and I were surprised when we arrived last night and our host encouraged us to put our order in on electronic machine rather than with our server which made the whole experience feel a little less date night. I guess it's convenient for some people but just felt a little more casual than we were hoping for.  Asked for more bread which never came. Ordered my steak medium rare but it was a heavy medium. My wife's tilapia was the most rubbery filet either of us have ever tasted. Potatoes were warm at best.  Happy hour drinks were rang in at full price.  Aside from the rubber fish, any one of these other things probably wouldn't have bothered us that much but all together it's probably enough that we will find some place else next time.  Update: outback contacted us and gave us a gift card to \"try again\". The service was much better and nothing was cold. Steak was cooked right but I was amazed at how much pepper was on the steak. I mean, I'm all for a bit of seasoning but HOLY COW. I had a large pile of excess pepper that was able to scrape off which made it mostly palatable. Likely won't be back but I suppose someone else may still like this place.",

The food: my caesar salad had little to NO dressing & my steak wasn't seared on the outside - it was BURNT. The blooming onion was burnt as well & the \"volcano shrimp\" we're meh.  My advice: Fire or reprimand the cook. He clearly doesn't care about the food he serves & the poor servers ..",

Not silverware or bread but lobster tails were missing with my filet order...whole appetizers, side items. When you spend 80 to 100.00 on takeout  food I expect my order to be correct. When I mentioned to the takeout staff what was missing, it seemed like an inconvenience to make my order correct. Shame on Outback! Never did a manager come out to apologize and while they were fixing their mistakes, the rest of my food got cold. My advise...check your orders before you drive off!!!",

    "text": "This was the worst experience ever. I took my husband today 08/27/18 out for his birthday at OutBack. And this was around 11:50AM... So not busy at all. We came in, and only 2 menus where giving to us, even though i had 2 of my children with me. 8 months old and a 10 year old.. Then it takes them 5 mins to come and take out drink order, we ordered 3 sodas and it took them 15 mins to get them out to us.. Then at that time we ordered our appetizers & our food at the same time, and asked to have it all come out at once Well it took 20 mins to get it, & just the appetizers came out! How long does it take to get a steak quesadilla and volcano shrimps out to us?? Mean while the other tables and new customers where being attended, and brought bread to the table. But not us... My husband said, maybe because we look different?? Even my daughter noticed how different, he was treating us...  Well appetizers where finishesd and i had to ask for refills for our drinks and napkins, again! Took 5 mins to bring them out. And the restaurant still wasn't busy at all. They only had 5 tables occupied, with us included... Finally our food comes out, after 15 mins of waiting.. &  My steak wasnt cooked the way i asked, i told my waiter about it, and he just said, Oh, and that was it.. Then i asked for A1 sauce and my waiter said sure, ill get it for you.. But guess what? He never came back! He went to attend the table right next to ours, and he was on it. Kept bringing bread and drinks & water cups. Again, i asked for my sauce and he said. Oh yeah, ill get it to you... Well he finally did bring it to us, but we were done eating by then, then i asked for some to go drinks. And of course he didnt bring it to us, he brougt new glass drinks, and said sorry, but we cant do, to go cups. Thats so not True. But ok.. We just left them there since we had already paid and we were ready to go.. Honestly worst experience ever and what a waste of $100.00... Just feel really bad about the entire situation, all i wanted was a good time and a great lunch, for my husbands birthday.. Maybe, hopefully, if we happen to try a different Outback, our experience will be much better.",

Seemed like a teaspoons worth.  My husband even asked where the dressing was when they brought it to me lol. He was being serious.    Fries were not the best fries I have had.  Not even mediocre.    And the breaded shrimp I ordered was disappointing.   Small and Soggy.    They don't even serve tarter sauce.     Server went to take plate away from one of us that appeared to still be eating ( there was food still on the plate ) without asking if we were done.   Felt rush at the end.    I was really looking forward to our dinner.  And left disappointed for the first time from an outback.  I haven't eaten at one in a long time and may not for a long while.",

    "text": "There were many steak houses to choose from in the Old Scottsdale area, and after researching on Yelp, we picked this Outback.  I have to say, this is one of the nicest Outback Steakhouses we have visited.  Some of them have a kitchy feel to them, capitalizing on the Australian theme to a fault.  This location feels like a traditional steak house, classy decor, appropriately dim lighting, and nice wood tones everywhere.  We were sat in the bar area, with plenty of viewing choices to watch the NFL football game on.  Not distracting, just nice.  Our hostess was working very hard, and had us sat at a nice table in less than 5 minutes.  I watched here before and during our meal...this girl works HARD!  She was bussing and cleaning tables like a pro, greeting and smiling whenever new customers walked in the door.  What a great employee!  My bad for not catching her name...  On to the meal.  My dad ordered prime rib with Aussie fries and steakhouse mac n' cheese.  His 12 oz portioned prime rib was huge!  Perfectly prepared to medium rare, he was very happy navigating his way around this slab o' beef!  My petite filet was perfectly cooked, accompanied by a nice side of the steakhouse mac n' cheese.  So good!  I also had a nice wedge salad before my entree was delivered, chilled and topped with plenty of bleu cheese and rings of red onions.  Fantastic!  We rounded out our dinner with a nice wedge of raspberry slathered topping...chilled to perfection and light and fluffy with every bite.  All in all a really great meal.  One nice touch of this establishment is the wounded combat veteran/Purple Heart recipient parking...really nice touch Outback!  We will be back!",

Just expect to wait for everything  An update: I immediately got a response from corporate apologizing for the lack of quality service. They sent a cute drink and cookies called \"Tim-Tam\", apparently the Australian version of s'mores...as well as a free appetizer. I greatly appreciate the prompt response and effort to make it right! Very impressive for such a large company to make such a personal effort! I love Outback and will never give it up, maybe will just visit a new location. Thank you Outback, it is very much appreciated",

We also ordered the ribeye with a side of broccoli and a loaded baked potato (her side of broccoli never arrived for the record). I can't even begin to explain how upset My stomach was... sorry to whomever reads this review, but I had the Hershey squirts for a solid couple hours after leaving. This hurt my stomach so badly that I had to hang out in the bathroom during recovery. What a waste of an evening and $80.... never going to this place again- disgusted that their food destroyed my stomach that badly. Btw- I'm an extremely healthy 26 year old male at 6'0, 205lbs..... I never have that kind of stomach issue. Safe to say you'll need to find an outhouse after leaving the outback; gnarly",

The meal includes salad, soup, entree and dessert. It was such a good deal I couldn't pass it up!   I chose the Caesar salad, upgraded to the French onion soup ($1 more), had the 6 oz. top sirloin with raspberry cheesecake as dessert.   In general, everything was good. The salad was cool and refreshing, the soup had beefy onion flavor, and the sirloin was cooked nicely at medium rare. At 6 oz the steak is a bit small but the rest of the courses made up for it. I didn't get to the cheesecake but I was able to get a to go container to eat it for later. For the price I paid I was pretty satisfied.   Service was warm and friendly. I think one of the managers was here tonight too and he was also providing excellent service and even held the door open for us when we left.   If I'm in the mood for a steak that won't break the bank this is a good choice.  3.5/5",

Tonight we enjoyed the unlimited option of shrimp to compliment my steak. They had fried shrimp and herb/garlic which came out pretty quick after making a request. The sirloin can be a tough piece of meat but I like it prepared medium and the price for an 8oz to me is great. I do like the Victoria cut but it's all about getting the biggest bang for our buck when 4 or more of us.  We had good success with the staff and bartenders for each of our visits but we look to sit in the bar area when it's available as we like the TVs and more social upbeat atmosphere!   Kids meal options are also reasonable and the mac & cheese is a hit (ain't no kraft).",

    "text": "We Have Been Regulars at Several Outbacks Usually By Where We Live. For Years Went ATO Scottsdale Location Because it Was Near The Harkins There. Never Had a Problem. Then We Moved & We Were Near PV Mall & There is A Outback There. Never Had A Problem There. Now for this Location..We Moved to Tempe 2 Years Ago. (Downsized To Save for Retirement ) Regardless We Tried The Tempe Location on Southern & We Have Had A  Few Little Issues Nothing Huge Steak Over Cooked Once Another Time Under Cooked They're Good About Making it Right. This last Visit However We Were Hugely Disappointed. Went For Steak Lobster Special Menu Pricing Not The Same As National Ad. Sorry But That Just Stinks. Outback Needs 2 Honor The Price Or Print A Disclaimer On Menu. **We Are A Franchise So Therefore We Charge You More**. I Think That's Sad. We Ordered As We've had Decent Meals On This Special In Vegas on Strip Was Excellent. ( For Years ) Must Be A Company Store As Meals Were Consistent!! My husband Ordered The Filet Because The Order Had More Sides The Picture On Menu looked Like The Filets I have Had At Other Restaurants (. *& Served I Worked For Del Frisco Prime Morton's Steakhouse & Brenner's Prime in Houston One Of First Prime Steakhouses In Nation) The Steak He was Served Was A Hockey Puck. Looked Just Like There House Sirlion. So We Asked ...& Waitress While Nice Just Said That's Our Filet I Had Decided To Order The Feast With Crab Cakes & Lobster. They Were Burnt On One Side & Dry on Inside. And The Lobster Was a Two Bite Mystery As in Where Did They Find A Lobster This Small ??  I have had Lobster At The Keg, Red Lobster, Mortons, Ruth Chris Harrah's Buffet & Never Saw Such Small Lobster. You Would have Thought We Were at Golden Corral!! I Asked 4 Manager Before Eating As I Was Disgusted At This Point ( & My Husband was Served Before I Was...& Yes I Mean They Brought His Entree Meal Before Mine...by 5-10...Mins   The Time Was Not On Our Side As It Was Sunday Night & Husband Has Early Work Time. So I Did Eat The Meal Although I Would Have Ordered The Ribeye Over The Crappy Seafood Meal With Baby Lobster. They Did Bring Another Lobster Slightly Bigger (But Didn't Offer One To My Husband Who's Was As Small) Let's Not Exceed Expectations For Crying Out Loud. My Husband Said As Disjointed As The Meal Service Was We Just Spent $70 On A Mediocre Meal We Should Have Gone To Boston Market  & Got Decent Meal at Much More Reasonable Price. If You Screw Up Someone's Meal & It's Been Brought To Your Attention That Should Be A Flag Respecting Guests Comments. I Wasn't Trying To Get A Free Comp or I Would Have Started Talking Much Louder. Kissing But Seriously..I just Wanted Something Close 2 What I Thought We Ordered. Guess We Need To Check New Location  As While This One Is Close it's Not Worth The Aggravation. By The Way MANAGER & Management- You should Always So More Than Just A Little if Customer Has Taken Time To Address Your Short Comings- Many People Just Mumble To Each Other & Don't Ever Come Back. As A Manager I Always Did What Was Right Plus Offered Either A Free Dessert Or If They Didn't Want Dessert Offer Taking Off / Example $10 Number One Meals Were Severed Separately By 5-10 Minutes. Lobsters Are Supposed To Be A Treat Not A Baby Bite. Don't Offer The Special Without  Disclosing The Pricing. We Are Not Planning on Going Back 2 This Location My Husband Has A Short Fuse But Won't Address It I don't Mind Speaking Out Because a Squeaky Wheel Don't Get Oil Without Attention! Next Time We Will Plan A Trip To The Keg Or Another Restaurant SOMETHING Wrong Here. The Party Of 6 With Kids Next To Us Waited Forever As Well. I Know it's Hard To Get Good Help But Don't Overlook Your Customers. Can't Imagine What It Would Be Like on A Busy Night!! By The Way We Still Gave 20% To Server    Because it Wasn't Her Fault It's Obviously The Kitchen Staff. Not Being Mean But After 20 Years In F&B Can't Help But Notice.",

    "text": "I have never been to Outback before but we had relieved $50 worth of gift cards to Outback for xmas & thought it might be fun to end my birthday weekend with a nice dinner. My boyfriend figured there would be a wait so when we were told it would be a 20 min wait for a table we were not surprised. We decided to head to the bar to wait for our table but within in 5 min the pager for our table was lighting up. The bartender was in the middle of filling our drink order but assured us they would not give our table away.  But they did.  However, the hostess profusely apologized & assured us we would have a table in minutes, which we did, so we weren't all that upset.  When we got our table,being my 1st time, we had to order the Blooming Onion. My boyfriend jokingly said \"If it's not perfect it's going back\". But when it came it WAS perfect! Very good. We ordered our dinner; my boyfriend got the sirloin & lobster(grilled) & I decided to get, from the special menu, the crab stuffed mushrooms (appetizer as an entree) & the classic wedge salad.  When dinner came I had not received the salad. I let them know & within minutes it came. Unfortunately, I forgot a wedge salad traditionally does come with bacon, which I don't care for so I sent it back. Although I had not specified that I had not wanted bacon when I ordered the waitress  took it back happily & courteously. With in minutes I had a replacement sans bacon.  Our meal was excellent the sirloin & lobster was grilled to perfection. The crab stuffed mushrooms & wedge salad also very good. In the middle of our meal the manager came to our table to apologize and comped part of our meal, even though we never complained. This to me shows the ultimate in customer service .  Things don't always go perfect, that's just life. But a company that not only pays attention to the customer experience but proactively accommodates when things don't go perfect gets five stars in my book. We are already making plans to go back!",

It really made me upset to wait forever for our food when the place is not too busy, very slow to get food. I usually get pasta with shrimp and scallops and I enjoy it but the portion of pasta is too small also so I usually have to purchase a side of it. Small portion size and our food always taking 45 minutes to get to us is not acceptable so I will spend my money elsewhere. Outback is overrated IMO, go to The Keg which is just a little bit more money but not much, food is much better along with the restaurant which is modern looking. If you go on a date The Keg would be the place to take her, classier and romantic.",

We went online an and got on the wait list so we didn't have to wait when we got there.  It said the wait was 20-35 minutes at that time, I indicated that we would be there in 45.  We arrived right on time and we still had to wait 15 or so minutes.  Not a huge big deal, 15 is better than 45 especially on a Sat night at a place like that.  BUT that is the point of the online wait list right?  So you don't have to wait?  I got my steak craving satisfied and had a nummy baked potato and salad. The food was average for a chain restaurant, it was what I expected nothing less... nothing more!  However, the service was AWESOME, so they my 4 stars.

I took my kids there last night for the first time ever, because the other place we wanted to eat was closed on Mondays (surprised) and OutBack was nearby.  /regret.  My daughter had the \"kids meal sirloin\" and it was not good at all.  Dry, with very little flavor.  She disliked it so much she asked for steak sauce, which she never generally asks for.  THEN, the waiter forgot she asked, and I had to ask a different server to get her some A1.  My daughter's words:  \"I can't believe any kids like this steak.\"  My son had a garden salad with Ranch, and he liked that OK.  ( Hard to mess up a basic salad. )  He also liked his baked potato.  But he also had a sirloin, and did not like it much either.  Both kids had leftovers which I decided to take home, hoping maybe to add the steak to something else like a stew or soup.  I had the filet  ( which was kinda like a prime rib cut ) with mushroom sauce, a baked sweet tater, and the vegetable medley, which was snap peas, yellow squash, carrots, and broccoli I think. It was decent, but definitely not worth $14.95.  The potato was the best thing on the plate.  I had never really been impressed by OutBack the 2 or 3 times in my life I had eaten there, and this trip confirmed my suspicions.  Will not go back - ever.  Overpriced and just not tasty food.",

    "text": "To me Outback Steakhouse is on par with Applebee's or TGIFriday's - nothing special.  The food is okay, the atmosphere is okay, the service is okay.   A friend of mine loves this place so the boyfriend and I went there for dinner. We all ordered steak. I ordered the outback special - a 6 oz steak with your choice of two sides - I chose fries and veggies. You get all this for $10. And guess what? It tastes like a $10 steak. I guess I've been spoiled at places like Mastro's and Morton's because this steak was not even in the same galaxy as steaks from those places. But it was $10 so I wasn't expecting it to be the best steak I've ever had either. Honestly, for a cheap piece of meat it was pretty okay. In retrospect I with I would have shelled out a few more bucks, maybe I would have gotten something a little better.  All in all, Outback isn't horrible, it's just not great. It's a chain and you get what you pay for.",

So I told the waitress and she said she would tell them in the kitchen but didn't offer to replace it or nothing. By this time we had already ordered, and I got a steak with a Cesar salad and a backed potato everything was great besides the salad I couldn't eat it at all because the dressing was way over powering. So all in all the service was good the food was so so. Will not be returning to this location!",

Another  for our waiters excellent attitude and a third  for the excellent food. We never recieved appetizer plates for our appetizers or bread, they may not give those out for bread. There was a stack of coasters on the edge of our table about 12 or more the whole time. No one else had extra coasters on thier tables and we were seated next to the kitchen. Slight wait for the asparagus. I will say I'm not a fan of our waiter sitting on the bench directly across us to take our order. My husband and I usually sit on the same side of the table. We will be back, looking forward to a better all around experience. Steaks were delicious.",

    "text": "I went here on Friday night with my family and it was a pretty meh experience. I think outback is one of those chains where somehow they fool people into thinking their food is good, but, in reality, it isn't. They do have good bread and good caesar dressing, but all of the steaks I have had there have been mediocre at best. This particular visit was not so great because my Grandma ordered lamb chops, but they turned out to be too spicy for her, so she asked for a less spicy version and they were very nice about it...but when it came back it was raw....not so awesome. So she had to send it back again and everyone else was done with their meal before she got hers. Also, I had the teriyaki steak and it was super sweet....not something I would want again. The meat was tough and it was just covered in the sweet sauce. It came over some odd tasting rice....not great.  I got it with a sweet potato which was drowned in butter and sugar. It just isn't someplace I would want to eat again if I had a choice.",

The appetizer arrived quickly, and the shrimp were hot and crispy! The Salmon, Chicken, and Ribs were fantastic! The fries that came with the Chicken and Ribs were \"So So\", as they were not very crispy. However, This isn't what you come here for. Our server, Lucas T, was very friendly, and attentive. He was well spoken when asked questions, and knew the menu very well. The manager (I cant remember Her name), was also very friendly, and asked how our meals were after we had finished. The prompt, friendly service (From the hostess', server, manager, and the gentleman that took our names when we walked in) is what many restaurants we visit are lacking. To add, the food at this location was better than we remember from the last time we ate at a different location. Cant wait to visit after the remodel!",

My steaks have always been cooked perfectly, the coconut shrimp is delicious (I prefer is sans the sauce since it covers up the crisp and sweet flavor of the coconut too much for me), the servings are plentiful, and for the most part every time I've been here the service has been from decent to great.

Twenty minutes after we ordered, our salads arrived with about 3 pieces of cheese and a drop of dressing.  We didn't see our server to ask for more dressing, so we just ate it. The bread they offered us after ordering our meal came after the salad and seconds before our main course. The very tiny plates made the portions feel small (not bigger like you would think), like you are paying $20 a plate for nothing.  We were given 1 half filled ramekin of ketchup to share between 2 people (and this was only after requesting it after I meal came...btw, we ordered french fries...).  My husband made a comment about how he remembers Outback being so much better.  I've only ate here a handful of times. After this last experience, I don't know if I will eat here again.  Just not for me.  I would rather drop $70 for two adults and a teenager somewhere else.",

The appetizer (steak quesadilla) was greasy and nearly unappetizing when it arrived, not tasting like more than cold and fatty steak with a spicy sauce in grease - although I'm not sure where the grease came from. Nobody asked us how it was, even though we barely touched it and didn't want to take it home. My filet was cooked correctly, but just wasn't . . . as good as I've experienced in the past.

Our service exceeded our expectations and the manager on duty even gave me a graduation present! I love outback in general, and would've been satisfied with the normal experience. But I was given the royal treatment here. I would like to personally thank Andrew P and our server Cody.  I highly recommend this restaurant, I've been to a lot of Outbacks and this experience was top notch.",

We're thinking great it'll be fast service.   We started off with blooming onion and asked for ranch on the side. When it came there qas no Ranch. We click the little ringer button on the tablet and within 8 minutes our server came back with a ranch. I ordered the Alice Springs Chicken, literally the whole reason why I came in. Its amazing if you had not tried it my bf ordered on one the stake plates. I would say probably about an hour later we received our food with no silverware REALLY.   So we waited about 10 minutes bored so we're examining our food and there was a BLACK STRIGHT HAIR in my boyfriend's food. I have red hair and he has long curly black hair so there's no way it could have been ours. By the time our server got back to her table the food was cold and our appetites were completely lost.      After waiting over an hour at this establishment we decided we really didn't want to wait any longer. Kinda ruined my birthday and a night and I don't think I will be coming back to this establishment.",

Even the house salad and bread are above average quality and the prices really aren't bad. Two 8 oz sirloins, both served with salad and a baked potato only cost me $35. I recently arrived on a Thursday night only 30 minutes before the restaurant closed and we were still greeted nicely and received great service. The hostess, Alicia, made sure we felt welcome. I don't remember our server's name (maybe Jake or Josh?) but he was very accomodating and provided excellent service with a smile. I will definitely continue to frequent this location.",

The service was subpar- the hostess didn't greet us with a smile or any friendliness at all. She never made eye contact with us and grew our menus on table In a jumbled pile. the waiter approached us the second we sat down asking for our orders and drinks (we didn't even get a chance to open the menu). We got steaks & neither of them were cooked the way we wanted them, but the waiter never came back to check that everything was alright, or if our steaks were cooked right- which most servers in steak joints do....Then at the end of the meal, the promo we ordered was supposed to come with dessert. He dropped off the check without even asking what dessert we wanted & when we asked for the desert to go, we got a dinky piece of crappy cheesecake. Now I know why people don't go to outback. Clean up your act, Outback.",

    "text": "I normally avoid reviewing places that already have a bunch of reviews that pretty much say everything there is to say about that place (usually it's restaurants), but my family hosted a birthday dinner for me here last night, and I have to write about my experience.  The first thing I noticed was how busy the place is. So when they started messing up some of the orders at the table, it was understandable because the waiter and waitress were really trying hard to keep up with everything. I was the last one to order and they actually forgot about me for a while. Whatever, s'all good. When I placed my order, and they asked me what kind of dressing do I want for my salad, I replied \"Italian\" and that was exactly what I was in the mood for. First shocker of the night: she looks at me and says \"We don't carry Italian dressing.\" I just looked at her for a minute, looked around at my family with a face like \"is this lady serious?\" So I asked what they DO have, she said honey mustard dressing. GAG! I ordered balsamic vinagrette, which they also didn't have, but she assured me they had a balsamic-like dressing. I thank the stars it was brought on the side because a) my girlfriend's salad was SOAKED in dressing and b) the balsamic-like dressing was honey mustard dressing! I couldn't believe it. As far as the steaks went, mine was great, but my girlfriend had to send hers back three times. We both ordered the filet mignon, and hers was really, really fatty, not worth the $23 it costs. They brought another one, then had to recook it because it was slightly too raw, but then it was perfect.  They brought me ice cream and sang me the birthday song and all that, then when it came time to leave, the final shocker: they cancelled our bill! Family members took the money they were going to use to pay for the food to give it to me for a bonus birthday present.. WoW Outback, good on you! We were all glowing when we left. They handled things well, all things considered.  I gave this place 4 stars not 5 because well, I'm a fan of this place, I don't love it to death though. Didn't seem right to bump it to 5 stars just because when you rate a restaurant, you have to take into consideration every factor that goes into running a restaurant, and I haven't been here in such a long time. When I come back again, if the service, atmosphere, and food continue to be superb, I will change my rating to 5 stars. For now, I wanted to bring attention to what they did last night that totally made my birthday!",

The steak of my niece was on the dry side (overcooked). My daughter's steak was as she liked it (medium rare).  For dessert, we shared a gigantic scoop of ice cream and whipped cream and an Oreo waffle with more ice cream and whipped cream.  We couldn't finish.  The service was good.

My wife and I went here for dinner a few weeks ago on a Saturday night.  The place was pretty busy but we were seated promptly.  They have glasses of decent wine for like 2 bucks ($20 bottles) and martinis for like $3.  The alcohol wasn't premium grade but wasn't plastic bottle stuff either so it was a pretty good deal.  I had a steak which was ok I guess and a wedge salad.  The wedge was excellent but they put some sort of sweet stuff in with the dressing I think.  Next time I would definitely order it without the sweet because then it would be an awesome salad.  To start we shared a shrimp on the barbie which was actually pretty good.  I'm really not the hugest fan of this place, I will return because it is kinda close to my house, has ok food, and great drink specials.",

We arrived early & waited approximately 5 minutes for a table; the hostess was very nice.  We then sat at our table for 20 minutes... without a word from anyone.  Not once did anyone say hello, offer to get us drinks, or even simply say 'hey we're busy, get to you soon.' We were completely ignored.  We ended up leaving after 20 minutes of being ignored & still the only person who said a word was the hostess.  I will never go back after this experience.",

Normally I wouldn't do that but I was craving a prime rib and I was on door - dash and it was the only prime rib there.    So I was actually mildly surprised because the prime rib was pretty good.    Particularly for delivery it was fairly decent. But the rest of they delivery experience really sucked.    The delivery was late I had to warm up the prime rib because it was a little bit cool and the delivery person was a bit of an idiot.  Like I said the prime rib was great and if you improve your delivery service you would probably get 4 or 5 stars from me.",

Your charging $13.99 for a sandwich why skimp on the cheese. I dried grease off the roll before it got soggy so it was fine. Just not happy about consuming all that extra grease.   Soda is the most expensive I have paid in a restaurant I think my fiance said it was over four dollars for a beverage? I'm sure a rep from the company could comment on that.  Also my salad had very little dressing. If your gonna load it up with lettuce I'm sorry but I don't want to eat bites with no dressing. Keeping food cost low and beverage prices high is a good way for me to stop coming.  The reason I decided on two stars was the very sweet server disappeared no check up on the food or refills or pre busing the table.  Accidents happen but our service sucked on top of the other complaints listed.   I used to really like outback. We had a terrible incident at the chandler location before it closed. Just hope this location isn't headed down the same path.   I will say they keep it clean so that's something",

The food is getting like Red Lobster where everything tastes the same. I think they really try, but it is just not there. They really want to push alcohol on you, and starters. I know they have to  but, it just seems that they are forced. Steaks were just OK not fantastic! The Potaoes were rock hard. I mean the baked potatoes so hard,even when we took them home and re cooked they were hard. Very strange. Bathrooms are clean, our server seemed very over whelmed as if she could not handle it all. It is not horrible, just not wonderful. They keep putting out coupns and they are good ones as well. I just do not want to go there when there are so many good other places.

    "text": "The best lamb chop dinner via takeout ever!  The chops were excellently crusted and tender insider.  Although one chop was a bit pinker than I'd have liked, none tasted gamey.  Even my 19 mos toddler enjoyed bits of it.  There were 4 double chops and totally worth the $22 + the side salad + rice.  Nicely portioned sides, too and I was able to sub the sides instead of mashed potatoes and veggies.  Loved the online ordering and the wait at the curb service.  I really could've eaten more but then the calories wouldve gone up and that 's not good for my waistline.  I would reorder this again!",

    "text": "Came in at 3:15 on a Sunday afternoon. Took a few minutes to get greeted. Took almost 30 to be seated. Manager was standing around. There were 2 servers and a bartender working that I noticed. There were 6 tables in the restaurant that had guests at them (I had time to walk around and count) and a few in the bar area. There were also 4 servers sitting at the bar who sounded like they had just been cut.  They were out of Uniform but I overheard and saw that they were employees. I've been in the industry long enough to know.   I found this a bit out of place. As a bartender myself. Sure people could've been cut. Shift change maybe. I tried to give benefit of the doubt. But there is no reason 5 groups of 2 tops should not be seated for that long on a regular Sunday afternoon. Whether one of the servers on was a food runner or whatever else was going on. I've done my fair share of awkward times to get busy and no one was hustling. No one seemed bothered that their lobby was filling as most of the restaurant was empty. All points deducted were due to this. I was in a good mood. I remained in such just because it's not the end of the world. But as someone who's done this a billion times before. It's just poor customer service.   The food was fantastic. Rachel recommended me a parmesan chicken dish and it was fantastic. Every aspect of the restaurant once seated was great. Rachel was friendly and fun. In fact she solo saved you one extra star. The food hit the spot and was delicious and timely.",

    "text": "I normally love Outback & I've NEVER written a review on a place, but this experience wasn't up to par & it was definitely a weird one...   I went to Outback for a birthday dinner with my boyfriend. Twice it was mentioned that it was my birthday by someone in my party & not one time did they do the \"let us offer you birthday dessert!\" thing... Which is totally fine, but they have always offered free birthday dessert any time I've been there with other parties & even if I wouldn't have taken it, it would've been nice to be consistent.  First thing I ordered was a bloomin onion because I was starving & who doesn't love them?!? About an eighth of the way into it, I couldn't chew through whatever I was eating... I pull it out of my mouth & it looked like plastic! I'm not one to overreact so I just alerted the waiter & he asked if we wanted to continue eating it. Continue eating it?!? Whatever. My bf joked that he would try another piece to see if there was more plastic & he had the same type of texture to his piece. The waiter took it back & told us he would make another one & then proceeded to tell us that it wasn't plastic, but just that the skin of the onion wasn't cut off prior to making it. So they made us another one & I don't know if it was because I was already grossed out by the one before, or if they were off their game that night, but it didn't taste right either.  It was such a disappointment considering that's almost my favorite part of the whole place!  So onto entrees...  I ordered a steak & sides & my bf ordered his steak medium rare. We get our food only to realize that the waiter had never asked me how I wanted my steak cooked & just cooked both of them medium rare; I told him that my meat looked like it was bleeding & I couldn't handle it. He was very nice & said he would take it back & put it into the grill for a little bit longer... I agreed that it just needed a tiny but as I wanted mine medium, but not bloody whatsoever. The manager comes back with my steak & is very apologetic & asks if it's up to standards. Just looking at the steak you could tell that the top had this hard layer over it as if it was burnt. I told him it was fine & he assured me he would make me another one, but at that point my bf had gotten his food & I didn't want to wait even longer for mine to get done as we had other birthday plans... So I cut into mine and it was just okay...not anything great as my previous steaks had been. I even had to cut off the charred part because it was like eating a burnt steak. Ugh. The manager was VERY nice, but at that point I just felt like nothing they did that night (food wise) was right & I was regretting even coming there for my birthday dinner. My BF (who is the King of loving his meat medium rare) had to send his back because he had to run to the bathroom to spit out a piece that he couldn't chew through! He got his steak back & it was overcooked as well... My steak was taken care of by the manager but the horrible bloomin onion wasn't & we were offered dessert, (not \"birthday dessert) but declined because I wasn't going to give them the chance to ruin that for me too.  Overall, we will definitely not be back to this location again! The manager was extremely nice & so was the waiter, but the taste in my mouth that I had from the horrible plastic tasting bloomin onion (that I paid for) was enough to make me stick with the Chandler location.",

I explained to my server that I had food allergies and asked if they could accomodate, she understood completely saying that she herself has many food allergies too. She brought me a Gluten-Free menu and I made my adjustments from that.  After placing my order the manager came out to ask more specifically how I wanted my food cooked wether it should be cooked on its own, what spices were acceptable and she also offered different options for sauces to which I was able to choose from.  My food was perfect, I can't complain about anything, they went above and beyond my request and I am so grateful. I never felt like my many requests and substitutions were a burden. I highly recommend the Outback at Southern and McClintock if you have food allergies.",

I will admit their bar area and seating next to it is a bit confusing. I sat next to the bar thinking it was part of the bar and didn't get noticed by a server for close to 15 minutes. When I was getting close to just leaving and going elsewhere, a nice server came over to help me.  My food was good, but the service ended up being even better. The manager (a woman whose name escapes me) came over several times to check on me. I think she could see I'd had a bad day.  I really appreciated her kindness.  I'll be back. I have to - their balsamic glaze is ADDICTIVE. Sometimes I will just crave the taste of it out of the blue and then be forced to go there to satisfy it!",

Food on the other hand was not super stellar. I ordered a burger during lunch, with cheese, that was so over cooked it was almost unpalatable. Not only was my burger dry and bland it arrived without cheese slathered in mustard, all of which would be fine if the burger was cooked to order and somewhat juicy. everything else at the table seemed acceptable including the soup, salad and other meals, sadly the burger was my only letdown.  I'm so excited that outback has started serving lunch however coming in on my lunch hour to A 15 minute wait isn't what I expected. We were told at the door that they were short on servers which was the reason for our wait.   The restaurant was clean the servers were friendly I will definitely give them another try but I won't be trying another hamburger from the outback in Tempe a.k.a. cheeseburger..

I place my order online, pay at the restaurant, and the food is always ready when they say it will be ready.  And they've never screwed up my order and I've used the online ordering service like 3 times.  Will continue to order my steak dinners here!  oh and plus if you place an order on Wednesday night you can get a 6 oz steak, salad, side, AND dessert for like $12.99. that's an amazing deal.",

Kayla was my bartender, made me a flavored ice tea because I didn't want water or regular unsweetened ice tea. Cheers to that and then she made the the huckleberry moonshine cocktail, only 140 calories. My meal was a 11oz center cut steak, sweet potato and brocoli and cheese. All the food was deliciously seasoned. I'll be back",

Not because I have anything against Australia, just because I hadn't ever been 'wowed' - and because we live in a fantastic foodie city.  Knowing the tab was on someone else made coming back a no brainer.  Side note - I have always ordered a large Fosters when I go to Outback... and every time I'm reminded why I never drink it anywhere else.  We got the appetizer trio - the ahi tuna / coconut shrimp / avocado & crab tower - and it was really REALLY good.  Like all three components - spot on.  I thought we were headed for greatness.  It was at that moment that I realized our server was more concerned with his appearance and phone than taking care of his tables.  At least five different times our glasses were empty / we needed something and he was nowhere to be found.  I got the prime rib and asked for the creamy horseradish - when it arrived, and it was raw / fresh horseradish I didn't really make a fuss.  However, my girlfriend's mom insisted that I ask for the creamy.... so we did.  Ten minutes later, he came back, plopped it on the table and said \"we were out - so I had to make some\".  This plopping of items on the table became entertaining because it continued for the rest of the meal.  BTW - the prime rib with horseradish cream was really good... matter of fact, everyone enjoyed their meal that night with the exception of the service.  Goes to show that excellent food isn't enough to get some of us to come back!",

She had a Porterhouse and I had the worst Filet Mignon ever. I ordered a mid rare and it came back rare. Hers did as well but that's how she likes it (never had a woman order steak rare but love she eats it not burnt to a crisp like most). The filet was not juicy it was more chewy. It's suppose to be pink, but mine was gray. The potato was good as were the fries. I will never go back with such lousy customer service and a manager who lies. I say that because as he strolled around and I mentioned the issues to him he offered a free dessert then charged me for it.  I would have liked to have found a new steakhouse in Outback but sadly I couldn't. I cannot recommend this business or the food. Being on SSDI I don't go out much and I'm glad I'm in a wheelchair and have constipation otherwise who knows what my stomach would have done with it.",

Also, what's the point of asking what type of vehicle I drive if I have to come in and get my food? The food was warm upon pick up and the checkout guy was super nice. Once I got home, I opened my to go boxes to discover an unappealing, measly 6 ounce filet tossed into the styrofoam container sitting beside a styrofoam cup containing broccoli that looked equally as poor. I then opened up the other box to find a porterhouse that consisted of primarily bone along with an over cooked, hardened sweet potato. The steak was ordered medium rare however both steaks were 'moo-ing' and bleeding immensely on my plate. The steak itself tasted average and again, the checkout guy was super nice so for that I give 2 stars. $60 for a meal described as above? Save your money, buy some steak and cook it yourself. You'll be much happier, I promise!",

What a way to spend a Friday watch as they walk away with your card that's waiting for you to sign after waiting 10 minutes to be acknowledged only to be told it might have been faster if I went in and didn't participate in their offering of curb side takeaway. Go to the Outback on Chandler Blvd and 54th street. Better service all around. Shame on me for going back a second time to this location. Food was not worth the wait.",

It's been a little over a year since we had one and we decided to splurge, although our waitress was very nice she was definitely over run with too many tables, so we seen her very little..mostly it seemed roving attendants helped us when we needed something...we both had prime rib and although it was good it was definitely not as good as Texas Roadhouse...it was a bit on the chewy and gristly side for me, and instead of bringing a bottle of a-1 when we asked they brought 2 dinky cups of it...our salads were standard and good and we also had the cheesecake (recomend blueberry and strawberry topping added to the menu) (they only had rasberry) for dessert and although it was good flavored it was still frozen so we ended up taking it home...we also had the onion blossom it was very greasy but it had a good flavor and the sauce that came with it was not very good to us so we had ranch instead. Over all it was a 7 out of 10 being the best..so not too bad. We will have to try their filet mignon next time if they have it...we will definately be back sometime..",

His was good with the  Philly cheesesteak but mine was served lukewarm and my chicken was raw. !  not following the usual customary tradition of restaurants that serve food, the server FINALLY came back around, she said she would send the manager over which took a good five minutes, Manager said that she was going to take the price of the chicken off of my entree which is just ridiculous!   The manager just was not friendly at all, I realize the restaurant gets very busy but that's no excuse to serve Ron check into a customer the outside was cooked but the inside was still pink and cold!

The flavors and seasoning were ok, but the food was not really hot, just sort of warm. Meh. The French fries we sort of soggy, like high school or cafeteria fries or something.  Parking was easy. The temperature inside was comfortable. The place was clean and well lit. The staff was friendly.  The only reason they even get their 2 stars is because they were playing the NHL All Star game right in front of me. AWESOME.  The food really though was the determining factor.

I had the 6 ounce sirloin steak, broccoli, and a sweet potato with the butter and brown sugar on the side ($11.99). All the food was prepared exactly as I had requested. My server was friendly, checked back a couple of times to see if I needed anything, and delivered the check just as I finished my meal.  Parking is close to the door. The dining area looked very clean. I will continue to keep this steakhouse in mind whenever I have a craving for lunchtime steak (too many steak houses do not open until 4pm).",
