We brought a ton of wine and had a great time.  Franco was our waiter - and I'm guessing since all the ladies at the table had a crush on him, that he is the waiter Sheila B wrote about in her review too.  Nice eye candy!  I absolutely love the eggplant rollatini and pretty much order it every visit.  We usually start with a Giuseppe's Salad and finish with a dessert to share.  My favorite is the white chocolate tartufa.  Pasquale (pictured above) is the sweetest man and makes the experience extra special every single time.    Since I'm writing this review on Thanksgiving, I want to give thanks to Pasquale and Ristorant Giuseppe for all the good times I've had there and all of the good times to come!  Salud!",

I wish I took pics of the food but was distracted.  We brought wine, cash and presents.  When you walk in the door Giuseppe himself welcomes you and gives you a hug.  He does know some of us but I have a feeling that's how he treats everyone.  I grew up eating homemade sauce and pasta so we're very picky about Italian Food.  Giuseppe's passes the test.  I know different regions in Italy cook different styles of food, so I think Giuseppe definitely came from the same region as my Grandmother and her father.  Waiters-friendly and warm.  Food-fresh and delectable. Atmosphere-homey.",

Clean dishes arrived magically along with the family style platters.  We were not pressed for time and chose a Monday night so we wouldn't disturb too many other guests.    Our meal lasted about 3 hours and every moment was perfectly orchestrated by Pasquale and his staff with entertaining stories and keeping us informed about what dishes we were eating.  He honored us by explaining in Italian and English since we were \"graduating\" from a basic Italian language class.  He even prepared special dishes for our folks with dietary restrictions!   The desserts are all made by \"Mrs. Pasquale\" so fresh and delicious.    We let Pasquale do all the ordering and he produced the whole meal for a prearranged fixed price.  (With a large group I like to do this, saves that stress at the end of the meal figuring out the bill) I think he went WAY overboard, it was such a wonderful dinner and so reasonable.  But the \"regular\" prices are great anyway, so don't let that stop you.  Go there NOW!   He has 17 new loyal customers so it might be busy.    It felt like a Sunday dinner at Nonna's, and we heartily thank and recommend Giuseppe's Ristorante to anyone.  Oh, did I mention that we brought our own wine?  They don't even charge a corking/glass fee!  Thank you again Pasquale, Alessandro, the invisible workers in the back, and all of the wonderful \"studenti\" who received their certificates  :)",

I asked about the empty table and he said some people came in but left to go get wine since they don't sell it there.  I reminded him that they don't take reservations which is basically what he was doing by holding the table for them and not seating us, customers who were there.   He said they would be right back, so we waited.  10 minutes went by and no one left the restaurant nor did the wine-runners come back.  So we hung out another 10 minutes and still the same thing.  We finally went back to him and said that he should just seat us since we have been waiting over 20 minutes now and the people he was holding the table for did not come back.  He refused to seat us!!  What poor management!  This is a dump of a place that says one thing and does another.  Avoid this place, there is much better Italian food in Scottsdale and an owners who know how to run their business.",

For some reason it is advertised on Yelp that there is no corkage fee which was confirmed when I called and ask during my reservation.

As others have noted, Ristorante Giuseppe is a Bring Your Own (BYOB) place.  Our oldest was celebrating her Birthday Day, so we were in a festive mood.  I've taken some photos of the interior of the restaurant. Clearly they were working on that Italian Grotta feel.  It has some buca di beppo type wall decorations.  But unlike that chain, here it's decorated by actual family photos and vacations shots. Very genuine!  Just like Pasquale.  We started out with the bruschetta.  It came with four pieces of italian bread for $10.95.  It might have seemed pricey, though the tomatoes were sweet and had a interesting topping of several cheeses. Delicious.  We next shared the Antipasto.  It was a very full plate of greens, meats and cheeses for $8.95.  The dressing was a light oil and vinegar that was just right.  For our entree, we each tried something different.  I went for the capellini with their homemade Neopolitan sauce.  Cody talked me into one of their meatballs, which was good.  But, not as good as their pasta and red sauce.  Sometimes with a marinara, if it's left to cook too long it can get bitter.  Not here, it was naturally sweet with chucks of tomato.  My wife ordered her favorite dish of Chicken Parmigiana, that came with spaghetti for $14.95. It wasn't a pounded piece of chicken cutlet, but instead an entire breast. Very nice!  Our daughter ordered the spicy Pasta Alex  for $15.95.  The menu describes it as the Chef's creation -- of pasta in a cardinale/pesto sauce with roasted garlic and spicy, crumbled, Italian sausage.  It was outstanding!  The heat came from the crusted red peppers and was just right.  The sauce actually reminded me more of a vodka cream reduction.  It was sweet and full of flavor.  Clearly the best of all the dishes!  For dessert, we tried the flour-less Chocolate cake, the Tiramisu and a Cannoli for $4.95 each.  I've taken a picture of the Tiramisu, because it came as an individual piece of two moist lady fingers. Wow!    If you're out and it's late, I would highly recommend coming here just for dessert and espresso.  It would be well worth it.  Our bill came to $88 in change including taxes but before gratuities. It was hand written and not itemized.  Another one of those personal touches which some might find quirky.  After getting home, I exchanged a bunch of messages with Yelp'er Michael T on how delicious the sauces were at Giuseppe's.  It's that unbridled enthusiasm and passion that folks have for this restaurant and it's owner Pasquale that make it special.   If you are looking for a white table cloth, foo foo experience; you might be disappointed and not understand the beauty of Ristorante Giuseppe.  But, we weren't, and we'll be back real soon.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "Went here a couple years ago and the food was excellent and not expensive. So this most recent trip I stayed nearby and went here for dinner with 3 other guys from work. I ordered something I saw in a picture on Yelp, but wasn't sure what it was called. The waiter said they didn't have it so I told him I just wanted tortellini instead. We ordered an appetizer of garlic bread that came with 4 pieces so we split the bill on that one. We all each ordered a drink.  Garlic bread was nothing but a 4\" x 4\" piece of toasted bread. Bland and boring. No big deal.  Then the food came. I received this small plate of tortellini. Not very much food at all. In fact was such a small amount I ordered the cheesecake so I would be full. The cheesecake was good by the way.   Then the bill comes. $30.95!!!! Hand written, total only, not itemized so no idea what they are charging.   I got back to my hotel room and look at the menu. Tortellini - 7.95 Garlic bread - 2.95 divided by = 0.75 ea Drink - 1.95 Cheese cake - 3.95 Total = 14.60 Now I understand the prices may be outdated, but I highly doubt the prices have more than doubled in the past year since the picture was taken.  My coworkers were all confused as well at the prices. I think we were all charged double! I don't live in Arizona so I most likely won't be back, but even if I did I still don't think I'd be back. $30.95 for a small plate of tortellini. Kinda bummed. Thought this was going to be my go to place for Italian. I guess not.  Then it came time to pay and they don't accept cards. Well I didn't have enough cash on me so I had to borrow money. I probably would've left a tip, but I borrowed all my coworker had left on him just to pay the regular bill. Not to worry since they charged us double. Probably pocketed the $16 I overpaid.",

    "text": "We have eaten here a few times over the years and not been real impressed.  The restaurant is unattractive with tables jammed in a small space.   The \"cash only\" signs don't add to the ambiance.  The worn tables are covered with pieces of glass displaying numerous pictures of previous guests (?).  You are given a cheap paper napkin and \"disposable utensils.  The menu prices do not match the prices posted on their website.  In fact, many of the dishes are double or more.  On the restaurant menu, there are a whole range of dishes without prices.  When the server was asked, he sort of stumbled.  My husband and I had the same dishes on our last two visits which were two months apart. The prices quoted were different.  Seems like nobody knows what they are.  The prices are outrageous for what you get and the lousy, noisy ambiance.  Food is OK - nothing special, rather bland.  The bread is awful and not very fresh.  Service is fair and the owner is rather unfriendly, unless you are a regular, which is someone I don't want to be.  A couple of the servers wear rather offensive t-shirts.  The bill is on a receipt from the 50's, with just a total amount due - no price breakdown.  To me it is the NO restaurant - NO reservations, NO credit cards and NO alcohol.  With these, along with the ridiculous prices, the owner is laughing all the way to the bank.  All in all, a place I would not recommend nor plan on returning to.",

    "text": "I just got back from Giuseppe's and I am absolutely amazed that people gave it the reviews they did. We went there in large part because of the Yelp reviews and learned that I need to take the reviews with a grain of salt (if I could find any salt left, since it all seemed to go into my meal). However, I did observe the owner and one of the servers greeting gastronomically-challenged regulars with hugs and kisses as the tacky Italian tourist music (some ditty with a chorus that went something like \"iggedy biggedy boom\") blared in the background.  Perhaps those unfamiliar with the wonderful restaurants Scottsdale has to offer were overwhelmed by the aforementioned music, the plastic red and white checkered table \"cloths\", the largely-abandoned strip mall, the rumble from motorcycles on Scottsdale Road (it is Cycle Week this week - yahoo!) or the roar of planes landing a few hundred yards away at Scottsdale Airport.  The menu itself is significantly less than uninspiring - something you'd expect at a Papa Gino's (though the food may be better there) versus an \"authentic\" Italian restaurant. My wife had a seafood \"special\" that smelled and tasted like it came out of a can. Perhaps it did, but if it didn't, shame on Giuseppe for turning fresh ingredients into a stomach-turning mess. Her meal was very bland, so I suppose the canned flavor gave it some distinction.  I had a chicken and pasta dish with their self-acclaimed tomato and fresco sauce. The vegetables were mushy, but that was the least of its problems.  There were a few positive points to this place that we will never go back to. The server and the owner were both very nice, so I suppose their not throwing the foot at us or uttering obscenities was worth one star. And the garlic bread and chive butter for the regular bread were pretty good, so if you want to pay $40 to just be able to talk about the bread, go knock yourself out.  Lastly, they only accept cash. I guess they do that so that you can't dispute the charge with the credit card company. Best I can tell, that's the one smart move they've made at Giuseppe's.",

My wife is still talking about the meatball she ordered.  The service was great and I felt appreciated for being there.  Cash only was sort of a pain but again the food quality was outstanding.  Highly recommend this place.",

Giuseppe is a family-owned italian restaurant on N. Scottsdale Rd with super friendly services. My favorate dishes there are on their 'chef recommended' menu. The price is higher than the rest of the entrees on the menu but not super expensive. One 'chef-recommended' entree is about $15. Very affortable and you won't dissapointed with the food. My all time fav dish there is a tomato based seafood pasta (only available over the weekends). This restaurant is a BYOW place~ Deserts is amazing too... Yumm...",

Since it was a weeknight after a storm there was practically no one there, which was fine by me since I already knew this place could get crowded (based on other yelp reviews).  My Husband and I shared the one of the pasta specials, which was baked ziti with all sorts of meats.  It was creamy, cheesy, meat filled goodness.  We also had a salad and garlic bread, which was also unique since it had a kick.  My Grandma had the pork parmigiana, she loved it.  Overall, this is a small Mom and Pop shop and it was VERY good.  It's always nice to support great places like Ristorante Giuseppe that are family owned and have great authentic food!",

When I walked in I felt instantly at home, this place could easily be in my hometown.  Everyone was so friendly and seemed to know each other.  We were able to choose our table and got comfortable.  (Its very small and I'd imagine gets busy at times)    It is indeed BYOB with no corking fee.  The menu is simple but has all the staples an Italian restaurant should have at the prices these dishes should be priced at.  The garlic bread was good, the baked ziti was divine.  It reminded me exactly of the baked ziti I used to get at the local place in my hometown and was prepared just how I like it....very light on the ricotta, heavy on the mozzarella.  The cannoli I had for dessert was fantastic.   Giuseppe's is exactly what you are looking for when you want the kind of Italian meal you had growing up on the East Coast.",

    "text": "My coworkers and I tried this place out on a whim one night when we wanted some good Italian cooking, and we successfully satisfied our cravings with Giuseppe's - we totally loved it! Ok, ok, 99% of that could be due to the FREE CORKAGE that they offer (and I'm a sucker for free corkage), but it's also an adorably quintessential, family-owned Italian place that isn't fussy but serves great food.  We walked into the restaurant (located in a little strip mall - like I said, not fussy) and were seated immediately by a window. It wasn't until we asked for a wine menu and were informed that it was BYOB that we figured out the whole free corkage thing...never one to turn down such an offer, I promptly solicited the help of my PDA to see if I could find somewhere nearby that would sell us a bottle, and thankfully Epicurean Wine & Cafe came to our rescue! They recently opened around the corner on Thunderbird and were more than willing to recommend a good wine for our Italian food, so I gotta give them props - make a stop by here before going to Giuseppe's as they have some unusual California wines that I've rarely seen outside SoCal.  Anyway, for dinner I ordered their tortellini special, which was some chicken pesto with cheese, etc. deliciousness...after I finished I was almost embarrassed at how quickly I ate the entire dish of pasta, but it was just so yummy! It was a dish that just oozed the love that was put into making it. One of my coworkers also ordered the spaghetti, which she said was great as well. Be forewarned, though - they don't accept credit cards, so you might need to stop by an ATM beforehand.  Somehow I have the feeling that anything we could have ordered would have been great...and cheap! I definitely want to come back for another taste!",

The staff is very friendly, and they do their best to make sure you're well taken care of.  The food is very good - they do very simple things, but they do them very well.  The BYOB is a nice touch, and its great that they appreciate wine as an integral part of the meal - they dont want to penalize you for bringing your own supply.  Its always nice to find a local place like this that is family owned - you can sense the pride in all the workers attitudes.  I'll definitely be back. Its cash only, but there's a BBVA right across the parking lot - easy little walk if you need some extra dough.",

The charm of the owner and the conviviality that is found in his restaurant always made it a real treat to eat there. Most of these happy memories occurred while he was at the location on 28th St. and Indian School... Which is no longer under his control. This location is where the talent that originated 'Giuseppe's on 28th' ended up.   The food here is absolutely delicious. Not a fancy, pretentious place, just consistently great food. BYOB with no fancy interior, this place defies so many Scottsdale norms it should seemingly fail. It's usually got a good many people in it, because I'm not the only one that knows, I'm just sharing the knowledge with all my Yelpin' peeps :]  I'm yelping this here restaurant because I feel I have to right a wrong. You see, the Giuseppe's on 28th [why did they let them keep the name? I'll never know] was featured the Food TV show \"Diners, Drive-ins and Dives.\" Cashing in on the reputation built by Pasquale, these guys overcharge for crappy renditions of the dishes I grew up loving.   If you really want to see the difference, try the eggplant parmesan sandwich at both locations. Really there can be no comparison. Or the rich, artery-clogging Alfredo sauce... Oh god just writing about it is making me realize I need to go back soon.  So, I put it to you, my fellow yelpers... Can you give this place a try and tell me if I'm right? I admit there's a chance I could be over-romanticizing due to my childhood experiences... But everyone I've brought here has been equally enamored with the food and with Pasquale.",

I do find 9pm a little early to be closing on a Saturday, but I didn't care. I had a table, a drink, and it smelled good.  Hot bread was brought over with garlic & herb butter. Great start to the meal. I ordered the chicken parmesan and they gave me a side of the Alex Pasta. It was all de-lish!

Our table was ready when we got there and his personality and personal touch was really greatly appreciated in a world of drab in phoenix. The place was crowed and there wasn't a single table empty. The whole place has a very family feel to it. The tables and walls are covered in family pictures and vacations to italy. (wish i was in their family)  The menu is kinda funny because all it has on it are the names of the dishes, it doesn't waste anytime trying to tell you what those dishes are lol.  It's BYOB and there's no corking fee, the waiter seemed kinda of bewildered when we knew previous to showing up about that but still didn't bring anything with us. He was very helpful and animated.  We got all of a drinks and food in good time. I ordered one of the specials, \"pasta alex\" which was a pesto and tomato sauce with some ground sausage pasta dish. Man was it good, and I mean really good. We all walked away raving about how good the food was. Everyone was super happy and half of us got their specialty dishes.   My friend and i shared one of their canolis and it was really awesome as well.   I don't have anything bad to say about this place, i'll pay the price of kickass italian food any day.    They only take cash! and they don't even give you an itemized bill, lol it just came on the back of our order that was given to the cook, and it just said $135.

From the minute you meet Pasquale and the rest of the guys there, you know you have found something great! Definitely go with their recommendations as I have loved them all and I have also really enjoyed the Red Clam sauce, which is next to impossible to find here in AZ that is worth eating! The cannoli's...amazing!   Also, they are accommodating for people with gluten allergies. They will either adjust one of their meat/pork entrees to work for you or you can ask about bringing in your own, unopened bag of GF pasta. I do have to caution you that when it is super busy, they aren't always able to accommodate when you bring your own pasta, so just be sure you are good with the back up plan!   Can't wait to go again, but don't foget to bring cash as they don't take credit/debit cards and they do close at 8:30pm!!",

The owner has always been very personable on our visits and you'll likely be waited on by one of his sons.  Even though we are from out of town we always feel as if they remember us.    My son LOVES their meatballs (they are huge).  The eggplant is good too and try the Tiramisu; I believe the owner's wife makes many of the desserts.  As for pasta dishes, we usually just tell the waiter what we are in the mood for and they recommend something.  We've never been disappointed.",

That's a big one for me, with a large family and a school-teacher hubby :)  Anyway, Giuseppe's is perfect for family gatherings or everyday go-to restaurant. Try the eggplant parmigiana and pasta w/tomato-cream sauce, and definitely save room for dessert!   Oh -- and Shannon -- it IS BYOB and there is NO corkage fee.",

The food was simple and delicious, warm bread with garlic butter, meat ravioli with red sauce and some lovely veal parm.  I was a fan of the portion sizes since I'll eat what is in front of me despite fullness at times.  The smell of the kitchen was a wonderful compliment to the meal and the wait staff was gracious and cheerful.   For the sizes of the meals it felt a little expensive, but everything tasted freshly made with vibrant flavors so I forgave the price a little.",

My favorite was tomorrow's special, asiago beef ravioli, home made.  They just finished making them for the next day, and shortly after I ordered regular beef lavioli, they came to me to offer thie asiago beef.  I must say this was the best ravioli I've ever had.  If I had more bread, I would be scouping up all the sauce that was left on the plate.  We ordered four other pasta, two salad, and some appertizer. Everything we ordered was very good.  Why not five star? It's probably because of pasta. I would prefer a slightly more on al dente side.  They have a good selection on desert too. Home made tiramisu was very moist.  They have several different today's special. If you like something, call ahead a few days in advance and request.  I would definately request my ravioli before my next visit here.  Cioppino is highly recommended too",

I had the manicotti. The ricotta was flowing from the noodles and was PERFECT.  The sauce was amazing...not too salty, not too sweet.  It tasted amazingly fresh.  My co-worker has an Alfredo chicken parmesan, with perfectly cooked fetuccine.  The sauce wasn't too heavy, and paired with that perfect chicken was....well, perfect!

When I mentioned our name and earlier calls, they told the other party they couldn't have the table.  That party told them they had called the previous day and gave them the name of the person that took their reservation - complete chaos. The table was made up of different sized tables looking like Frankenstein's table and squeezed the 10 in with overlapping chairs in front of the rest room entrance.  We told the other party (of 9) they could remain seated and have the table. It was 5pm and many other tables were available and we asked if they could give us a larger location they said no!

The name sounded romantic to me. But it was the opposite of romantic. Loud, brightly lit, sassy servers, and children running amok. Reminded me instead of a raucous Italian family reunion. But still a good time!  I love that it's BYOB with no corkage fee. That itself is a great value on it's own.   We started with the bruschetta. We weren't planning on getting an appetizer but we were talked into it. Yes, the servers are a bit pushy with the upselling. But the bruschetta was tasty and bursting with fresh flavor so we were glad we did.  I had the eggplant rollettini and my husband had the pork Parmesan. The portions weren't as big as they are in other Italian restaurants. I was expecting leftovers to take home. But still very filling. My eggplant was very tasty but a bit salty. My husband and I both loved the marinara. It was very unique. I detected a warm seasoning to it... cinnamon or nutmeg? I don't know but it was good. My husband thought his pork was delicious. He said it lacked breading but was still excellent.  We will definitely return but we learned our lesson. Expect a casual and energetic good time with delicious food. We see this being a great spot for a double date... each couple bringing a great bottle of wine.",

And--as if that weren't enough--the atmosphere and the owner Pascal make this feel like home. After a visit or two, Pascal will remember you, and a friendly smile will become a warm hug. I would like to say that everything I've tried is great, but in all honesty I order from a couple of favorites every time. The Pasta Alex with its addicting spicy and meaty flavors is superb. The cheese tortellini is cooked perfectly. The cardinale sauce is a must, and the bruschetta (whether the standard one on the everyday menu or one of the many daily special versions) adds the perfect touch. On top of all that, this place is BYOB with no corkage fee (although you may want to share a bit with Pascal to say thank you).",

    "text": "Giuseppe's is really one of a kind. As soon as you walk in, you can tell that your experience is going to be great. You're warmly greeted by the staff and they give you a sense that you're almost walking into their home for dinner. That's the vibe that I got because of how welcoming the entire staff was. I had never been here before, but they make you feel as if you've been a regular for years.   The food. My God...the food! You must-I repeat, you must try the eggplant appetizer. Your life as you know it will never be the same. Don't bother wearing socks because they will be knocked off. Luckily, I wore sandals so I was ok. It comes with delicious garlic bread. Who doesn't love garlic bread, right? I got the Pasta Alex. The portion is huge! I had to take some home (it was good even warmed up the next day) It has a bit of a kick to it, not too much where you can't enjoy your meal, but enough to make sure you don't pass out from carb overload. Add this to your must try's.  You can bring your own booze! No more wondering if a place has this or that, you bring what you want! You'll need to sit down for this part. There is no corkage fee!! You read correctly, my friend. No fee. Nada.    You can't leave without trying their sweet treats of deliciousness! The cheesecake is amazing! Everything that they have there is made there. How cool is that?!   You really need to do yourself a favor and check this place out. I will be returning...with stretchy pants.",

They recommended the pork cacciatore.... can't find the words to describe it. Delicious!  I am not a big eater and typically eat about half of what I am served. Not this meal, I finished it all and was tempted to lick the plate clean! The pork was so tender, the sauce was robust, and they even added extra vegetables to the dish for me.   The owner is very friendly and you feel like you are dining in his home.  I would definitely recommend this restaurant and give it a two thumbs up.",

We have been going to Guiseppes for years because the food was amazing, it was BYOB, and the prices were reasonable. In November we went for a family celebration, ordered a similar amount of food as in previous visits, and our bill was almost $100 higher than the last time we had dined there. Even more surprising, the check wasn't itemized and it's a cash only business. The final nail in the coffin was just 3 days ago. A group of 12 of us went to dinner and ordered family style. We has bruschetta, antipasti salad(missing the meat) mushroom ravioli, pasta Alex, and chicken piccata. Somehow, in a restaurant with nothing higher priced on the menu than $18, our bill was almost $38 per person. Once again, we were handed a piece of paper with a number on it and nothing else.   It's a sad day when a once great restaurant succumbs to such a ridiculous money grab from longtime customers.",

Once we were all seated our surly waiter came over and announced you all want bruschetta \"it's good\".  Same arrogance with salad.  We finally got menus after about a half hour.  We were enjoying our wine and yes it was busy and loud as expected for a popular restaurant on a Saturday night. Not sure why he was so  sarcastic...perhaps it was the pretty young girls at our table, making him nervous?  When they asked if we wanted dessert we reminded them (with gifts and flowers ON the table) that we were celebrating TWO birthdays and were told NOT to bring in our dessert.  At that point, a cannoli and a piece of cheesecake were \"presented\". The food was good, recommendations right on.  Prices fair and definitely a family feel about the place.  Next time we want to celebrate, we'll actually \"try it before we buy it\" so we'll know what to expect...",

Felt forgotten on the patio.  Great meal. $80 for three. No wine. There is a compass bank in the parking lot. I had a service charge since I bank with a different bank but the owner is not paying any ATM fees or card charges. It's about $15 a plate so this should be built into the business plan.

My husband ordered the cioppino and was told it is only available on Friday and Saturday. Then change your menu so that it is not under DAILY SPECIALS.  SO, he ordered the veal parmigiana which was ground veal and not a cutlet?  For $19.95, it should be a cutlet. My daughter ordered the ravioli, which is pictured, and it was bland and that dish should be $9.95 not $14.95 for 6 ravioli. But, as another reviewer mentioned, I do not like that the receipts are not itemized. We figured our bill to be $4 more than it should have been and it's cash only. It is a nice family owned restaurant with pictures everywhere, even on the tables. It is small so probably gets crowded quickly. But, my Italian taste knows now to stay with my regular one because prices are more reasonable, itemized receipts, takes credit cards and they are from my hometown Chicago.",

My go to is generally Chicken Parmesan and I wasn't disappointed.  It is cash only, but that's not difficult. BYOB is nice, we can have a great meal without our bill doubling with a couple of drinks!  I highly recommend, we will become regulars!",

This is a cash only restaurant, only once I forgot, but thank goodness our bank has a branch on the other corner, so problem solved.  I have had almost all their offerings.

    "text": "My boyfriend has been trying to take me here for years... It's been years! But every time he brings up this place, I'm not in the mood for Italian. Since I've been under the weather this week, I decided to order takeout last night from here. I ordered the Pasta Alex and he ordered the Peppino Special. We also got a side of the garlic bread and the tiramisu. Tiramisu is my favorite dessert and I have the biggest sweet tooth. I was so excited to see it on their menu. My favorite place to get it at the moment is at Pomo Pizzeria.   With that said, I was disappointed with the tiramisu when I got home and got to see it. It looks like they soaked two lady fingers and then made a tiramisu sandwich with it by adding mascarpone cheese in the middle. Half of each lady finger was dry so it was kind of a sad dessert... Especially at $4.95.   The Pasta Alex was delicious. I would definitely get it again. I didn't bother trying my boyfriend's dish because it had similar pasta, just a different sauce. It was kind of intimidating as well because there were so many different chunks of meat in his order. I wasn't in the adventurous mood last night. The menu online said it is made with a loaded baked ziti and that was one of the reasons he ordered it. We thought it would be of penne or rigatoni or another pasta of that sort but it was the same pasta used in my dish. Not sure if he will order this dish again.   The garlic bread was just okay. Maybe it's something we need to dine in for but it just looked like it was covered in butter and paprika for color. I've had much better garlic bread elsewhere. Heck, I make better garlic bread! I'll give this place another try before I have a final decision about it. After all, it's just down the street and my dish was pretty good. Hopefully, I can increase the amount of stars at my next visit.",

I wasn't horribly impressed with the pasta that came on the side - pretty run of the mill boxed pasta. The pork was mostly very tender, but had a few tough/dry pieces. The delicious flavor made up for the few pieces of dry pork though.   My girlfriend ordered the Fettucine alfredo, and it was really good. There was plenty of sauce on the pasta, and I helped sop up the left over alfredo at the end with the garlic bread we ordered. The garlic bread was overcooked and burned, which is one of my pet peeves.   The price was reasonable. I would go back, but I wouldn't consider it to be the best value in town.",

The ambiance of the place seemed nice for the short time I was there.  Food however was a disappointment. I got the eggplant parm which is a favorite dish of mine. Didn't taste (or see) any fresh basil and the aromatics that I look forward to were completely missing. the cheese on top wasn't even browned at all. Looked like someone had piled together the pieces and nuked it or something. The eggplant wasn't crispy but I can't blame them since I did have to drive it home before eating it.  The tomato sauce with it was very chunky which could be  plus or minus depending on your preferences, but I wasn't really impressed with it. The included pasta was cooked to a very nice al dente.  Probably wouldn't come back.",

Within fifteen minutes, the place was packed so I suggest arriving early if you want a table. The interior of the establishment is rather small and there are about eight tables outside.  My wife wanted to order the veal parmesan, however, we were informed that the veal is served in patty form rather than scallopini so my wife ordered eggplant parmesan instead. The eggplant was thinly sliced, very tender, and delicious. The sauce was not overly acidic and the portion was perfect. A ziti with sauce is served on the side. Had the ziti not been slightly underdone, I would have given this establishment a 5-star rating. I had the house special - Pasta Alex. This was served in a light cream sauce with Italian sausage pieces and had a spicy kick to it which I really liked. This dish is like Italian crack! My wife and I devoured every last bite and would have licked the plate if we did not have manners!  As other reviews have stated, there is no corking fee. Some guy even brought in a 12-pack of beer to enjoy (Coors Light? Couldn't you have brought in something better than THAT?)  Our waiter was very pleasant and the owner and his son came by frequently to see if everything was okay. I highly recommend Ristorante Giuseppe and will definitely visit this place often!",

    "text": "Let me start this by saying that the place is ok. The food is decent and the prices are ok....maybe a little on the high side for some of the dishes considering the location in an old strip mall.  However, my judgement of their prices must take into consideration the plethora of overpriced mediocre pretentious restaurants in the Kierland area.   My experience with Italian food is from growing up in San Francisco and eating at the neighborhood Italian joints, including those in North Beach. Also I have traveled Italy extensively.  I had the Spaghetti with Meat Sauce and one meatball.  The soup was pasta e faggioli.  We also had an order of garlic bread.  The soup was ok. The pasta in it was rigattoni that was properly al dente. That was promising.  The beans had the right consistency as well. The soup however, was not quite as hearty or flavorful as I've had in the past. Still, I would recommend it.  I'd give it a 5 out of 10.  The spaghetti noodles were of decent quality and just slightly past al dente.  Perhaps it's because americans like their pasta a little bit softer. The pasta I've had in Italy was really al dente.  The sauce was tangy but there was really little meat. I thought it was plain sauce until my wife pointed out a few spots of meat. To me, that's not really a meat sauce.  I like a sauce that has a bit of a kick to it.  This was more of a tangy  crushed tomato sauce. So overall the dish was a 5 out of 10.  The meatball had a lot of filler in it. It tasted good but you could taste the filler. But the bottom line was it tasted ok.  I'd give it a solid 5 out of 10.  The garlic bread was bad. Do NOT order the garlic bread. First of all, the bread was plain bread shaped like a roll. That's not proper. Get some good sourdough with a good crust at least.  There was very little garlic taste and it was not toasted enough.  Go to Ernesto's on 24th and Clement in San Francisco. They make GREAT garlic bread and it comes complimentary.  The service was earnest but plainly there is not enough wait staff. On a Sunday night, there was only the cook, one waitress/busgirl and one server/greeter.  It took forever to get our check. They were nice but plainly overworked. The solution would be to hire one more waiter.  Ambiance is meh.  It's an oasis considering the horrible shopping center it's in. But it's not North Beach Capp's Corner.  Throw some candles on the table at least. Spice the place up.  Clearly though, this restaurant has a following. It's usually crowded. I guess people need a casual place to eat away from the silicon breast and botox crowd over at Kierland Commons.  I will return again to try some of their other dishes and report back.",

I checked out this place for a date night last Friday, and was really quite tickled with the entire experience.  I had been to Arrivederci, an Italian restaurant in the same complex, for lunch several times before and never even noticed this small place just a few doors down.    While the atmosphere isn't cool, trendy or romantic, it feels warm, inviting and down-to-earth.  There was definitely an energy in the place that let you know you were among friends-of-Giuseppe's, and I liked that; it felt like we were discovering a well-loved secret.  We split the Giuseppe Salad to start, which was a pretty standard (eh) Italian-style salad that served two.  After some bread/garlic butter, we also split a pasta dish (rigatoni + tomato cream sauce + spinach and chicken) and the homemade tiramisu for dessert (was the best tiramisu I have ever had, and though it was smaller than most portions I have seen, it hit the spot).  I think our entire bill was ~$32, and I thought it was a great value.  Also, heads up -- CASH ONLY, no cards!  I liked the huge variety on the menu, but didn't realize all the mix-and-match possibilities until our server talked us through it -- so if it's your first time going, I would definitely let them know and ask them to take you through the menu.    I will definitely be going back to this spot to try to worm my way into Giuseppe's extended family  :-)",

They offered no corkage fee, which is a nice plus, and had a set menu for New Years. $30 per person for 5 courses including a small dessert. Each course came out at a good time, our server was really watching and taking care of us.  I really enjoyed the food, the pasta and sauces were all amazing, and it was really great atmosphere. You could tell everyone who was in there was a regular, they all said goodbye to the staff as they left. We closed the place down at 10:30, but they didnt seem annoyed or that they were trying to rush us.  Excellent service and overall experience, we will be back and making this recommendation to others.",

Pasquale, the owner assured me they would be and suggested I come back as early as possible to avoid the crowd. When we returned at 4pm I was told they were not open until 5pm. No where in there advertising do I find this disclosed. Rather than sit in the hot sun for an hour we drove to Houston's for dinner. This was terribly inconvenient. Pasquale could have mentioned this rather than tell me to come back as early as possible. They don't care - they have more business than they need. I will never go back!",

    "text": "Good find in Scottsdale. Family run Italian food with good prices and servings appropriate to the price. In other words, not too much and not too little. Mostly pasta dishes served in tasty sauces. The Meat Ravioli's were very good and the Stuffed Shells were excellent, and both reasonably priced in the $10-$12 range, with a side link of Mild italian Sausage for under $2. The Bruscetta appetizer special was $5, and came with 4 sliced of toasted bread with ripe tomatoes, basil and fresh Parmesan, with a delicious olive oil drizzle.  The restaurant has the feel of an upscale pizzeria, decoration and table-wise. Located in a strip mall, it is not a place to impress a first date with the decor, but a nice place to take someone for a good Italian meal without breaking the bank. The service was very pleasant and efficient. It goes without saying that being able to bring your own wine without a corkage fee in North Scottsdale in not only unheard of, but a fantastic way to keep your evening's cost down to your comfort level. We will definitely be returning. A great start to a night out before seeing a movie.   They advertised that they close at 8:30pm on Saturday, but we walked in at 8:25pm and they did not blink an eye, and seated people as late as 9pm.  Reservations are only needed for larger groups (they wouldn't take one for two people). Be warned though, they do not accept credit cards, so hit an ATM before coming with your favorite bottle of wine.",

We were waited on by Giuseppe and it was a very enjoyable experience. I ended up having the manicotti which was very good. I also had the opportunity to try their meatballs (also excellent) and the tiramisu (it, too, was delicious!). The pricing is pretty good, not much more than some big chain restaurants, and you're supporting a locally owned business in the process. Be forewarned (as we did not know this) it is a CASH ONLY establishment! No credit or debit cards accepted. I would recommend this to anyone who hasn't been before and wants to try something new, with a good atmosphere, just remember to bring cash!",

    "text": "What a fun evening!  This was our first time and we loved it.  Giuseppe is a True Italian from Naples and he has created such a fun atmosphere.  The place was packed and everyone seemed happy.  It is so nice to be able to bring our own wine instead of paying $70 for a $20 bottle of wine.  The food is fresh and tasty.  Giuseppe has adopted the American version of Italian food but it all tastes so good.  This is not like Andreolis where Giovanni still prepares dishes just as you would find them in Italy but it is really good.  I had the lasagne which was first rate.  My father-in-law had the veal parmigian which was excellent.  The others had pastas with the marinara sauce--all delicious.  We topped it off with tiramisu and Cannoli which were both wonderful.  The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars was because I save that for the restaurants that serve truly authentic Italian food.  Finally our waiter made the evening so much fun.  He employed my daughters to serve other tables while we waited.  He joked with us without being obnoxious.  He's the guy who looks a lot like Jesse in Breaking Bad.  I absolutely recommend this place.  You will have so much fun and the food is great.",

    "text": "I took my girlfriend here for our first Valentine's Day together. I was looking for my \"Lady and the Tramp meatball moment.\"   Instead, I came away underwhelmed.   I believe much of my issues stem from the prix fixe menu that was available, but there were other problems as well.   The service was average at best. I forget our servers name, but she rattled off the entrees, brought us our bread, and then expected us to order. We were both a little shocked. Personally, I felt rushed all evening and I had to work against the servers to slow the evening down.   The ambience was less than ideal. Italian music played oh-so-faintly in the background. The lights were up all the way. No candles on any of the tables. We at least got the wine glasses promptly (though the provided wine key had a really loose hinge), though our wine was so-so (a custom labeled zinfandel I had got from a different place. Great label, average wine).   These issues were important to setting the mood for the evening, but we still had to eat. I had high expectations for the food, especially given the large number of very positive reviews from other Yelpers. However, the food did not live up to expectations.   The gnocchi I ordered was pillowy soft, exactly the way it's supposed to be, with wonderfully flavorful sauce. Alli's dish, a chicken piccata, was long on chicken, short of pasta, and the lemon sauce was only okay. In short, the presentation needed work.   Again, I think the problems with the food stemmed from the prix fixe menu. Under normal circumstances, I'm sure Ristorante Guiseppe serves wonderful, authentic, full-blooded Italian food, but this time, the experience felt rushed, cheap, and quick. In summation: not the Valentine's Day ambience one is trying to create.  I am very willing to give it another shot, but I would not recommend Ristorante Guiseppe for a special occasion.",

I came across the yelp reviews for this restaurant and decided to check it out. We were not disappointed. It felt like a neighborhood restaurant. As we were sitting at our table, an older gentleman walked by on his way out and wished us a good dinner and told us he had been coming there for years, I can't remember but I think he said 20 years or something. I love that you can bring your own wine and if there is a corkage fee at all, it is very minimal. The food is delicious and the desserts are prepared by the mother of two of the servers. It is close as I am going to get to having an Italian grandma make me dinner. We went for NYE and it was a super deal.  7 course meal for $37!  If you are looking for a fine dining atmosphere you won't find it here but if you want casual good Italian food, where you are often served by members of the family who owns the restaurant, you will love it.  One thing to note is that they close quite early, like at 8:30 pm I think.",

We waited for ever for any bread to come. My boyfriend ordered a Sprite and never got it. And finally when the waiter noticed, he didn't want it anymore.   On to the main course, which I will say the food is good. I had the Alex Special, which was the perfect combination of spicy and creamy. My boyfriend ordered the seafood pasta and he said it was really.    Overall, the food is good, but the service is terrible. This place is by far not cheap and a certain expectation is set when your pasta dishes range from $13 to $17.",

They only take cash here, but it is BYOB and no corkage fee which is fantastic. Our server was telling us that his mother made all of the desserts and boy were they delicious.

When we asked for a brake out, he wouldn't do it.  When we asked how much the tax was, the guy at the register said he wasn't sure! What?? didn't want to make a scene so just paid and left.

So bring own fave bottle of wine as I did.   When we entered we were greeted and asked to sit outside. There were at least 5 empty tables inside but I guess we were supposed to ignore that. Once they saw though that we had our own bottle of wine, we were then escorted inside bc I guess you can't drink outside...?  Our biggest disappointment was the waiter. He was a typical example of someone having a bad day and showing it instead of brushing it off and taking care of business. Either that or he was in a state of perpetual bitterness. He was short, never smiled and never asked how the food was or if we needed a refill. So my husband's water was not refilled the entire time and our experience was not appreciated.  Now if it was just a matter of waitstaff, we would venture another visit, but the food was also subpar.  We ordered bruschetta and that was actually something to write home about. The tomatoes were fresh and it was sure tasty. We also ordered the eggplant and tortellini. Eggplant was delish! The tortellini however tasted like it was out of box and the sauce out of a can. It was nothing special and they should just 86 it. We did see other food orders that looked great, but I wonder if the taste matched the appearance.  We spent over $50 and were sorely disappointed. Keep in mind I'm no Scottsdale snob, but would choose Olive Garden any day over this place.  Also, a star should go to the young lady bussing tables. She was one of the few who seemed genuine and helpful.",

The sauces are fantastic...The reason I went with 4 instead of 5 stars  1)The check hasn't any breakdown....say a table of 4..1 gets eggplant parm one gets pasta with 1 meatball 1 gets linguini and clam sauce and the other just gets bruschetta....now 2 have desert..........the check you receive hasnt any break down it would just say 89.95 for example  2)CASH ONLY , I can say speaking for myself a few times I was there I would have ordered more and had desert if I could have used my card. It just seems very very limiting but given how long Giuseppes has been in business clearly it works for them  If neither of these items bother you then a five star",

    "text": "First, I will say the food is very delicious, and homemade tasting, cooking from the heart.  My reason for the rating is because the last 3 times we've eaten here we have felt like a huge inconvenience.  Granted they are a busy restaurant with loyal regulars (I would consider us regulars as we eat here every time we are in town) but the greetings have almost seemed like we are an annoyance. No one wants to feel like that when patronizing a restaurant.  We are in town again but we are going to try another Italian restaurant-not a chain- down the street.  We may find a new go to.",

    "text": "Don't let the strip mall setting fool you, this is a neighborhood joint that is worth the visit. We have been to Ristorante Guiseppe's in Scottsdale, AZ twice now, and both times, the food was terrific! You know that it is a local place when the drinks are BYOB and they only take cash - no credit cards. Knowing that, we came ready with wine in hand and a recent trip to the local ATM!  The food is best served family style as the dishes are plenty and that way you can share and taste several options. We started our meal with their Bruschetta that was nice and garlicy, topped with oodles of tomatoes and cheese on nice crusty bread. We shared their Guiseppe's Salad tossed with a wonderful Italian vinaigrette and lots of goodies abound. Their Pasta e Fagioli was the best I've ever had! Creamy and full of flavor.  For mains, our table ordered Stuffed Peppers, Lobster Ravioli and Eggplant Parmigiana. We're talking good old style comfort food. No pretense, no glitz and glamour. Just good honest food. The pasta was perfect, sauces were delish and everyone was enjoying every bite. No leftovers here!  Our service was attentive even though the place was hopping. Expect to become part of their family; that's how it works there. Yes, this is definitely on our repeat list for Scottsdale. We will be back!",

Also this place is cash only and you must BYOB (I love the BYOB part). The staff is so sweet, particularly the owner, and the restaurant is unpretentious. And with how crowded this place can get on Friday/Saturday night, you can tell that this place is a local favorite. However, I just don't enjoy my food as much here as a lot of other Italian joints in Scottsdale. The first time I went, I ordered pasta with vodka sauce and today I got spaghetti with vegetables and  Alfredo sauce. I do not recommend getting the pasta with vegetables... The veggies are a strange mix of baby carrots, broccoli, cauliflower, and something else (almost like a store-bought steamed veggie mix). The pasta itself seems good quality and the sauces are tasty (though not exactly made with fine ingredients). If you do go, I would recommend getting the pasta Alex as I've heard it's really good. Unfortunately I can't eat it because I'm vegetarian.",

The rudeness factor totally unacceptable though. First ones there, were four of us. We had salad first, which was limp and soggy. We were there for about an hour and half and by the time we left it was busy, with one party waiting. The owner actually came over to us and (rudely) told us we were there long enough and there was someone waiting for table so we had to leave. Before we could even respond, the table was cleared. If we were asked nicely, might have been different, but the food was certainly not good enough to put up with the rude owner. And by the way, cash only policy is annoying, surprised the IRS isnot all over this place! Obviously, I will never go back.",

    "text": "If I were writing a review after our first experience at Ristorante Giuseppe with our friends, the rating would have been easily 5 stars. After our first visit I let as many people as possible know that we had found a wonderful Italian ristorante that not only served great food, but you could bring your own wine and not pay a corkage fee. All four of us couldn't wait to return.   That being said, our second visit left us angry. The food was still exceptional. The issue came when the bill arrived. As stated in reviews here, the bill is not itemized or printed on a receipt but rather numbers are scribbled on a ticket. The number on the bottom of our check was 57.85 and it was circled. The rest of the check was not legible. We put in 80.00. A few minutes later the waiter brought the check back and said, as an accusation,  \"Hey, you shorted me\".   Turns out that there were two totals on the check, the $57.85 and another total for 36.90. When we asked for a break down we were told that there were two $5.00 corkage fees...the rest we couldn't understand as he mumbled a few sentences and hurried away. We paid the bill, though we still do not understand why there was a 20.00 difference between us and our two friends. Our meals all cost the same, the only difference was that my husband ordered a side meatball and a side salad...according to their website the meatball is 1.95 and the salad is 2.95. Not even close to 20.00.  As the owner was passing by, we asked when they started charging a corkage fee as there hadn't been one a few weeks prior and his website states no corkage fee. He seemed to be insulted by our asking. His response was the website was outdated and that he had to pay for wine glasses.   OK. No big deal. Question answered. But he then, very loudly, told the table behind us that we were complaining about the fee. We were not, we were asking for clarification. Then from several feet away, it's a very small restaurant, also very loudly, he adds that if the money was too much for us, he would take it off the bill. He repeated this several times...making sure that all of his customers heard him. He was not only incredibly rude, but very aggressive and insulting in his effort to embarrass customers who dared ask a simple question. Never before have I felt so insulted by a business owner.  If you want delicious Italian food, do not care how you are treated or rather mistreated, and have no problem contributing to shady business practices ( in addition to charging whatever they want, Giuseppes is CASH ONLY, NO PRINTED CHECK OR RECEIPTS...so no paper trail...thinking they are somehow always in the red come tax time), then this is the place for you. Personally I will stick to establishments that treat their customers with respect. I am including a snapshot taken from their website that states, boldly I might add, that there is no corkage fee. I believe that is called False advertising.",

The service was amazing; our server was one of the sons and he never stopped smiling.  We tried the stuffed shells, the eggplant parmigiana and the Caesar salad. It was all delicious. The Caesar dressing had a hint of olive oil, the eggplant parmigiana was thick and tender and the stuffed shells are now absolutely my favorite thing ever.  There's no bar, BUT you can bring your own bottle of wine and they will serve you without a corking fee.   Note for the owners: Your joint is amazing. I love the traditional, down-to-earth feel but it could really benefit from the convenience of a credit card machine. I wanted to take my boyfriend here this weekend but we didn't have cash on us.

The prices were fair and the food was excellent! Next time though I will remember to bring my own wine, like many of the other customers had. It was a quite and small restaurant and even the staff was very friendly, they made you feel like you were a regular and were truly interested in making sure you were happy with everything you got.    I ordered the special spinach and ricotta ravioli with a cream, whine and tomato sauce-it had great flavors and everything came together nicely, the only thing I would change is maybe cook the ravioli a tad bit longer because mine was a little hard but it still tasted great! My boy friend got the special which was the  Franco Special which is  pasta cardinale (pink sauce) with pork rib-meat and spinach. He absolutely loved it and would barely let me have any and I kept wanting more. No complaints at all with this dish! and last but not least we had the cheesecake with a cup of regular coffee. The cheesecake could not be any better. It was homemade and so creamy and the perfect level of sweet. We were \"sharing\" but I'm pretty sure I ate most of it. The coffee was dark and super rich, I personally like my coffee a tad sweeter but it was \"very smooth and easy to drink\" according to my boyfriend who is borderline coffee addict, so I'm thinking it was actually really tasty like everything else the offer here.   I am so in love with this place I will make sure we go every time we are up in Phoenix/Scottsdale area and he said he would have no complaints either.",

My expectations were very high because of how my friend lit up when he described this place. From start to finish, my first experience was flawless. I walked in and literally heard a table towards the front of the dining room arguing in Italian with each other, pinch me! I was welcomed, the owner introduced himself to me, showed me pictures of his kids on the wall and described the specials. I told him I thought the special with braised pork shoulder sounded amazing, but that I promised a friend is try the pasta Alex. He said in a thick Italian accent, \"I'll take care of you son\". He arranged a version of the special with the pasta Alex sauce and a small side of pasta Alex which I ate until my plate was spotless, thanks to the fresh bread.  I could go on all day. I've been back 10 times and had equally rewarding experiences. I've sent several friends in and they've all said the same. If you go and don't enjoy it, either you don't like good food or you have a psychiatric condition and should seek medical attention. In that case Mayo is just up Scottsdale Rd.",

In fact my wife and I had dinner here the night before having our first child.  Pasquale (the owner) told her that Olive Oil would help induce labor and he wasn't lying!  The menu doesn't change from lunch to dinner and its also a BYOB, but that's OK because Pasquale and his staff make you feel right at home.  Indoors or on the small patio out front the food isn't fancy, but it doesn't have to be.  Good Italian about food, family and fun.   Insider's tip!  Still hungry, ask for a little more (its often on the house).",

I used to go there when Pasquale owned that one too.  It's ok, but it is not the real, honest to goodness one that Pasquale owns and runs.  You feel like you have just stepped off a plane to Italy...the Naples region actually.  The olive oil is not like any other you will get anywhere.  My personal fav is the eggplant rollatini.  I always start with the pasta fagioli, a Giuseppe salad.  I love this restaurant and the family that run it.  A must go place for any and all visitors.   PS  the desserts are made by his wife or mom.  YUM!",

I forgot how good the food is here. If you are looking for a high end, snobby typically overpriced Scottsdale restaurant, this is not your place, however, if you are looking for delicious food, wonderful, warm and friendly staff along with the owner Pascuale and his son Giuseppe, this is the place to go. We had the bruschetta, fresh tomato, garlic and high end olive oil...SOOOO good, then the Ravioli with Cardinale sauce ( Alfredo sauce blended with homemade marinara sauce)  and spaghetti and huge meatballs  with the most flavorful marinara anywhere. The atmosphere is warm and inviting, only about 12 tables so get there early. You feel like you are eating with family. Try it, you will like it, I did. I will not forget to go back soon.

I normally get the Peppino Special, but this time it was dry, and the pasta was not ziti.  My wife had the pasta alfredo with sliced Italian sausage, and again it was kind of dry, and almost looked reheated instead of fresh.  Order a side of garlic bread, which when we opened it back at home was burnt on top.  I will say the pasta & faggioli was spot on, so there was some saving grace.  I normally leave this place craving more, not sure what happened this time.  Didn't see the normal family members present when we were there.  I hope this was just a fluke.",

Everything from the marinara sauce to the chicken was amazing! It all tasted fresh! And you can tell it is made with quality ingredients. This restaurant lives up to real Italian food.   I highly recommend this place. The only reason why I gave it 4 stars was because it's cash only. I never have cash on me so this can be an inconvenience to some.",

We were Not out of line in any way.  We just wanted  to see  the menu and said we'd be back for dinner.  It was obvious he had no interest in making us feel welcome.  Apparently he's busy enough and doesn't  need  any new customers.  I understand restaurants totally.  My family's business in Fla. was restaurants.  Successful because we served good food and service but always welcomed guests and made them feel special.  Most Italians myself included are warm and inviting  Thanks for letting me share.

    "text": "Ok, I was actually excited to try this place after reading the reviews. Most were good but there were some dicey reviews. So I needed to make up my own mind.  My daughter and I were going to a movie so we stopped in for a quick bite on a Wednesday night about 7. It's a cute place and the owner greeted us st the door. Seemed like a nice Italian guy. We sat right down and the waitress came over promptly. I kinda wanted an eggplant parmigiana  sandwich but, she told me they only do sandwiches for lunch. (That was kind of off for me). The menu is somewhat limited but that's ok too. I had a small house salad that was fresh and nice ( a little heavy on the oil in the dressing but nice). They brought over some bread and herb butter but the bread was phx yuck bread. I was hoping for some good crusty homemade bread. Don't get me wrong Giuseppe's is a very reasonably priced place, especially for Scottsdale so, I don't want to be over critical. My daughter ordered cheese raviolis and I ordered capellini marinara with a meatball. Mine was a tad salty but the meatball was fresh, lite and tasty. My capellini was a little mushy but fine. The marinara was rustic and flavorful - it was chunky not watery at all. Just a little salty.  The raviolis were good but not homemade. They were fine and both were good size portions.  I love that you can bring your own bottle. Phoenix needs more of these places.  Even though the menu says there's no corkage fee I believe there is a $5 fee now but that's still reasonable. The owner stopped by twice to ask how we were doing and how everything was. The food came out hot and promptly.  We had to leave for our movie so we didn't have any dessert or coffee so I cannot comment.  Overall we had an enjoyable dinner and was very comfortable. It seats about 40 inside and maybe another 20 outside - weather permitting. So on a busier night service maybe a little more challenging. I would like to go back with another couple and bring a couple bottles of wine. I give Giuseppe's  out of five. But look forward to going back again.   Ciao' Giuseppe !",

He immediately took our family. It is very small and they only take reservations for 6 people or more, so go early if you want to avoid the wait (there is no waiting area). It all adds to the experience! This has become our favorite place to eat in Scottsdale and we go to celebrate our family events (as we just did last night). Be sure to bring your cash (no credit cards accepted) and your favorite bottle of wine (they don't serve alcohol). Giuseppe's is the best!",

The pasta in the mostiaccoli was slightly under cooked. The cannoli should not be crunchy like they're totally hard.  This was totally hard.  It should be both crisp and crumbly at the same time. Never hard like an ice cream cone... didn't taste right at all, in fact it tasted old.  The tiramasu was good.",

Everything was exceptionally fresh and well seasoned and in very large portions.  The Tiramisu was heavenly. Yum!  I will return to Giuseppe next time I'm in town.  I hope that other restaurant owners in the area will sample this menu and use it as an example of proper food and service.   B+",

We were able to set up a reservation on valentine's day (that was awesome) When my wife and I got there, we had to wait about 45mins. That was the only thing I could say that sucked. The atmosphere was great so we didn't get too upset about the wait. The owner was super nice to my family and he's son took my kid around with him to keep him entertained. They had a fixed menu of 4-5 items only that night. I ordered the Pasta Alex and my wife had their seafood plate. The pasta Alex was amazing! I couldn't have asked for a better pasta dish. We stayed until they closed. You do have to remember that this place is \"CASH ONLY\" but that was okay because I happen to have cash on me that night. I highly recommend this place to everyone that likes great Italian food and a great atmosphere. If you are very impatient, I don't recommend this place. They can take a while because they are \"that\" busy. My wife and I have been there 2 times since and we love this place.  FYI, This place is BYOB with no corking fee. ENJOY!",

The eggplant was drowned in breadcrumbs.  In fact, the eggplant and the breadcrumbs had become one soggy entity. Could not even find the eggplant.  Seemed it was sitting on a shelf in the kitchen waiting for some unsuspecting diner to order it. It was NOT freshly made, that's for sure. My husband ordered spaghetti putanesca with angel hair pasta.  Arrived with fettucine pasta and only three olives. The other two friends with us ordered seafood dishes with garlic and butter sauce and they loved their meals. We did not say anything because we did not want to put a damper on the evening.  Perhaps the place loses quality control when it is crowded.  Service was excellent and the owner is very friendly.",

It is a small family owned restaurant and you can always count on seeing the restaurant's owner Pasquale greeting customers and stopping by to see how everything is tasting. A few of our favorite dishes include the Meat Lasagna with meat sauce, the Peppino Special (baked ziti with chicken, veal, sausage) and the classic spaghetti with Meatballs. An additional perk is the option to bring your own wine without the corking fee. This is a small restaurant which seats maybe 50 people total and is a nice family casual atmosphere.

I always order the Pasta Alex and Giuseppe's Salad, but there isn't anything on the menu that I've tried that isn't great.  (And the specials are always worth trying as well.)  I am pretty sure that everyone that works here is family, or practically family, so the atmosphere is always fun and laid back.    You should be prepared to wait if you come at peak time.   This is a very popular local spot.  You'll see families that range from newborns to grandparents, as well as plenty of couples on a date night.  Also, good news is that you can byob.

    "text": "Traditional 70's style Italian-American food in a strip mall mainly notable because you can bring your own wine with no corkage fee.  Don't believe the hype - this place is nothing special.  Contrary to the many reviews here that comment on how cheap it is, I found it a bit expensive for what you're getting, which is not exactly nuova cucina.  $15.95 for two small (non-homemade) cannelloni a la carte is not a bargain in my book.  Their linguine with white clam sauce is some canned clams tossed with a copious amount of oil (1/2 a cup perhaps) and some boxed pasta for $12.95.  The $9.95 \"insalata Romana\" is a plate of tired iceberg lettuce, a tomato wedge or two, and a few shreds of bland cheese swimming in a very tart vinaigrette.     This is the kind of food that used to represent Italian food in America before the food revolution of the 80's.  The kind of place you'd find, not in New York or Chicago, but in Terre Haute or Tampa at a time when \"eye-talian\" food was still considered a bit exotic.  The many reviews stating that this is \"real homemade Italian food\" are a bit puzzling since it's neither homemade nor Italian.  This is very old-fashioned pre-foodie Italian-American food and while it's OK for what it is, it certainly isn't \"real Italian\" food by any stretch of the imagination nor is it, for the most part, homemade.    N.B. No, a visit to this restaurant is not \"just like going to Italy.\"  For that matter, it's not just like going to Little Italy.  I realize Phoenix is not exactly a mecca for italian food, but WTF people!      The mostly 60+ crowd seems to love it.  I can only guess that they are overwhelmed by nostalgia for a simpler time, because while it may not be Kierland pretentious nor a crappy chain restaurant, the food just isn't very good.  Seriously.   The servers have a strange attitude that I guess is supposed to be \"east-coast\" or something (rushed, cocky, borderline rude) but seems a bit out of place in what is basically a mom and pop strip mall joint serving canned food with plastic red checked tablecloths and thin paper napkins.  In any case, they are very selective with their attention and you can wait quite a while to get something.  Also, as several other reviewers have pointed out, they give you a non-itemized bill with just the total due written on it which seems to include an extra 10% or so with no explanation offered.   This seems quite bizarre to me but apparently no one objects.  At this restaurant, $15.95 + $12.95 + $9.95 somehow add up to $45.65.  The non-itemized bill is a weird affectation at best - why would you do that, especially in a cheap joint like this?  But to do that and then mis-calculate?  There's a word for that in Italian - it's imbrogliare.   $54 for two with tip for a simple shared salad and two pasta dishes with no meat and no drinks.",

HOWEVER, if you want good Italian food and very reasonable prices, step right in! Went with the \"Out to Lunch Bunch\" yesterday and it was quite the experience. The owner was everywhere. He took the orders, delivered the food and picked up the cash. He reminded me of the \"Soup Nazi\" from Seinfeld. One of the group asks for more of the wonderful marinara sauce. the \"Soup Nazi\" says \"No.\" Another one says her pasta is cold. He says \"you ate most of it and now you say its cold.\" Of course he was kidding. The one got her sauce and other got her pasta heated. Too funny! When the time came for the separate checks, the owner asked each person what he/she had and announced an amount. That was it! No written check. To one of the group he said \"Give me $11 and I'll be happy.\"  Unusual to say the least. I would say the ambiance is \"early family.\" I liked it -- pictures of family and friends adorned the walls and under the glass on the tables. I found it endearing. So even though the place is not what you expect of a restaurant today, the food is good, the price is right and the staff and owner are friendly and accommodating, I'll be back.",

For $10.95 we got the fresh tomato and basil special .  4 large toasts, not a lot for the price.  More topppings and a lot larger at Postino for 2 bucks more.  I stayed optimistic though.  My side salad came, good price of $2.95.  Ice berg lettuce with one olive and a tomato.  I guess this is all you can expect.  Then the main courses.  We had a variety eggplant, pork, lasagna, Alex special, 3 @ $15.95.  The portions were very small.  I'm in agreement with the below, they are European portions, and almost filling, but not for $15.95!  I hate to say it, but I would rather head to Carabba's and get 3 times as much food for the same price.  And I'm not even a chain person.  I just finished ice cream at home and my fiance is chowing down on chips.  Not what I expected!",

Penne pasta with I think is a vodka sauce with meat and sausage. I've never tasted sauce like this! It was awesome! A little spicy so I didn't need to add crushed pepper. I just added a little parmesan out of habit but it didn't need it. The sauce was not red. It was orange with small size pieces of meat. I wish I could eat it all! Yum! :-)         As MacArthur said, \"I'll be back\"",

We ordered Veal Parmesan and linguine with clam sauce. We also ordered dinner salads, which were a separate charge. Unfortunately the salad was basically plates of iceberg lettuce drowning in Italian dressing. The entrees were good. All in all it was decent, but I'm not in a hurry to go back.",

The eggplant appetizer was out of this world.  Everyone's dinner was spectacular - I had the ravioli.  And we loved the flourless chocolate dessert.    You want to go here.",

The ambiance is a small hole in the wall place, with laid back, casual setting, nothing too fancy.  The food looks all freshly made.  However, ordered the daily special recommended by the owner.   The daily special was 4 large ravioli on a plate (two stuffed with cheese and other two stuffed with meat).  It wasn't expensive, I think around 7-8 dollars, but that portion is more like an appetizer, it wouldn't fill anyone up.  So portion size is the only reason that I can't give it 5 stars.  Looking forward to going there again in the near future and ordering off the menu.",

    "text": "When I hear the name Giuseppe I picture a little old man in the kitchen making spaghetti and meatballs like his grandmother used to make. So I was surprised when I found out that there isn't anyone named Giuseppe working in the back, though this wasn't the only surprise of the evening. The other little curve ball was a little embarrassing, we were scrambling to scrape together enough money to pay the bill, Ristorante Giuseppe only takes cash. However, this little stumble did not interfere with the food nor the fantastic service and hospitality we received.   Ristorante Giuseppe is what a mom and pop independent restaurant is all about. The charismatic father runs the front of the house, the sons are the servers and mom makes all of the desserts. The father Pasquale interacts with everyone, he's so warm and welcoming it was like going to a friends home for dinner. While they do not serve liquor, you're more than welcome to bring your own beer and wine to accompany your dinner and no corkage fee, unbelievable.   The menu is filled with classic Italian-American dishes and as well as assorted daily specials. Our server was telling us about the specials and noticed that his eyes were steel blue. I'm not sure how long he was talking to us but as soon as he walked away my trance was broken; I have no idea what he said. I can be such a dork.  Once you place your order you're brought out a basket of warm bread with garlic butter, I love little touches like this. Just be careful not to fill up on the fluffy bread, there's so much in store starting with the deliciously simple Eggplant Rollatini ($9.75). Slices of eggplant are lined with cheese, covered in bread crumbs and pan fried, then the roll ups are covered with tomato sauce and cheese. Or if you loved stewed peppers and onions try the Peperonata ($6.95), a great combination of sweet, savory with just a hint of spice.   My dining companions filled me in on the nightly specials which ended up being a couple of pasta dishes. The first was the Peppino Special ($15.95), a mix of tube pasta, alfredo and tomato sauces with meatballs, chicken and sausage then covered with cheese and baked. Another was the big brother to the tortellini called Tortelloni ($15.95), a large ring shaped pasta, filled with meat then again covered in sauce, cheese and baked. Do you see the trend here? Baked pasta dishes are so hearty and satisfying; no wonder the other patrons looked so happy.   Along side we also had Sausages ($1.95) and Meatballs ($1.95) which were platted as a clever homage to the maleness of the restaurant, with just a little bit of cream sauce on the tip of each sausage, well you get the idea.   Desserts were as comforting and homey like the creamy smooth Cheesecake ($3.95) which ended up being one of the best slices of cheesecake I've had in a very long time. Not being a fan of Cannoli ($3.95) Id have to say that they turned me into a believer. Its ricotta filling was so light and airy with just the right amount of chocolate chips and a pastry shell that was crisp without a trace of greasiness.   Genuine and honest, Ristorante Giuseppe is a neighborhood gem that I wish was in my neighborhood.",

Meanwhile, Pascal moves from table to table, warmly greeting everyone as a friend, laughing with them and making each guest feel as though they belong. The wine flows as food makes it to each of the red checkered tables adorned with campy pictures of family events. And the food...I have been tempted many times by their various specials, but I keep coming back for Pasta Alex. Delicious, perfectly prepared pasta, cheese, and spicy sausage...incredible.

    "text": "Let me begin by saying the food here is very well prepared, fresh and good quality. The ambiance is definitely family friendly. The restaurant appears clean and wait staff Professional. The lasagna may be the best we've had. The restaurant does not sell alcoholic beverages, but supports a BYOB policy. Now for the bad news. As previously stated by a couple of other reviews, the restaurant is a cash only business. I get that....It's a business decision. However what troubles me is the bill is not itemized. As we did the math, our bill appeared to be approximately $10-$15.00 more then we calculated based on the prices printed on the menu. We have traveled around the world and have never seen a bill in a restaurant that only reflects a \"total\". Is this legal in Arizona?  Based on other reviews, people have been publicly humiliated for questioning their bill, so I decided to let it slide. However, I felt ripped off and in spite of the good food will probably not go back. This is Scottsdale and there are so many equally good restaurants to choose from. I would like to know if this \"total bill\" practice is legal, so I will check with a couple of my legal eagle friends for future reference.",

    "text": "This review should read more like a 3.5 stars.  My wife and I ventured out here last night on a whim.  We were happily surprised when we didn't need to pay a corkage fee!  It is always great to bring a nice bottle of wine from home and refrain from paying the ridiculous markup that some restaurants charge.  Soo.... you're saying I can pay $50 for a bottle of wine I can get at the supermarket for $16.   The service is poor to average.  Our server was attentive, but seemed bored when he was talking care of us.  He didn't really want to explain the menu to us and was hurried.  The ambiance isn't great.  It's very family friendly but it's definitely a hole in the wall.  The owner is sweet and he makes the rounds to every table hob nobbing with the regulars and greeting the newbies.   The food itself is the star here which it should always be.  We got the spaghetti with meat sauce and the chicken parmigiana.  The spaghetti was cooked well, and was delicious.  The chicken parmigiana was pretty good, although there were parts that were a bit stringy.  The desert was the best part.  Home made and yummy.  The cannoli was good and reminded me of some of the best cannolis I've had in New York, and the tiramisu while not the most stylish of presentations was yummy.   That tiramisu is probably the best representation of the place as a whole.  Not really appealing to look at but filled with soul.  Also it cost $55 to eat for 2 people with apps, entrees, and desserts.  So that rocks.  They only take cash so be warned, Amex will not save you.",

This little family owned and operated Italian place has always, and will always, be amazing. The service, the food, the atmosphere, everything about this place is as good as it gets.   At least one or more of the family members are working every night, and they take great pride in what they produce. There are family photos all around, as well as on the tables. The 3 boys all work in the restaurant when they are available or in town, and even if you don't get served by one of them, the service is always amazing.   They have specials every night which I love, because I am still able to try new things even though I have been coming here for years. My favorite's are always their ravioli and their Giuseppe's salad. Some of their menu items are named after each of the sons, which is a really nice gesture.   They also allow you to bring your own wine, and no corking fee! Such a great part, and it makes the bill a little lower than if you were to go elsewhere.   We will go to this place as long as it is around. We go here as soon as one of our friends comes into town for the first time, and they always request to go back when they come back into town. Even though we live in Cave Creek, we make the trip to this little restaurant. Great place for family, food, and a whole lotta love!",

    "text": "Well if had a choice of ZERO stars I would have done that for Giussepe's!  We have been going to Giuseppe's for many years & thought food was better than most and BYOB was great to bring in wine for us!  The billing has always been weird even for a small party of 2, but the last 2 times with large groups it has been a total mystery to figure out with no line items for food & just a total on bottom??  Plus cash only to pay really??? Not knowing the bill line items is not normal anymore anywhere!  I'm warning fellow yelper's too that we just had our final meal here with a group of 12 going out here for dinner, we ordered dinner family style with brushetta, an antipasta salad with literally no meat on it, a ravioli with mushrooms no meat, pasta Alex house favorite, & chicken piccata to get the final mysteriously excessively large bill $450.00. All the couples are trying to figure out how this could be so high in a restaurant with items priced on the menu than $8-16, with our bill at $37+ per person. Why would you again, hand us one piece of paper with a number on it with nothing else?? This would never fly for anyone in corporate america.  I agree with what Lee W. said! It's a sad day when a once great restaurant succumbs to such a ridiculous money grab from longtime customers!! UGH UGH",

During this visit, we tried to make reservations and were told just to come in and there would be no problem. We did that and were seated at the last table in the back which had extremely poor lighting. We asked about moving to another table and they were reluctant to move us - but they finally did a bit later. The \"owner\" and I believe it's the owner because he told us he's the one who puts the money in the bank. He told us he had been there 16 years and that they NEVER in those 16 years took reservations for 2 people. This is not True since I have personally made reservations for 2. The most disconcerting thing about our visit is how rude and nasty the owner was. This restaurant is now OFF our list.",

This isn't what your looking for if that describes your favorite Italian food.     First of all the staff seemed to be mostly family.  Giuseppe walks around toasting patrons and mandating you put your phones away because he wants you to enjoy the time your having his his restaurant.  The BYOB policy is awesome and allows you to bring wine you know you'll enjoy without blowing the bank.    The menu is very classic but the specials rotate and were amazing. Based on the other reviewers you may want to ask what the price is before you order a special, but I don't recall having that problem without group and there were 6 of us.    Everyone in the party had appetizers, salad, entrees and we split 3 desserts.  The total was about $30 per person after the gratuity.  I see other reviews saying similar amounts were paid but I really didn't think it was a bad price to pay for a great evening out with friends.  Be sure you bring your cash, no cards at this joint!

    "text": "I love Italian food, so finding good spots in the Scottsdale area is always on my list. After reading all the great reviews of Giuseppe's, we decided to try it out. We went on a Saturday night and luckily got there by 5:40, because by 6pm, the place was packed (even the outside tables). Having grown up in the Northeast, Giuseppe's definitely gave me the feel of Italian restaurants I grew up with. So with that, I give Giuseppe's an A for atmosphere.  The service was okay. It was polite, but a little slow and not much attention was paid during the meal. I'm used to servers checking at least once to see if we need something. That did not happen until after we were finished with our meals. The one thing I was very disappointed with was the lack of attention from the owner. I watched as he went around the restaurant talking to people and asking how their food was. Although we were pushed a little out of the way, he certainly could have stopped by our table as well, but never did. That did not go unnoticed. For service, I give them a C.  As for the food, I got the baked ziti with tomato sauce and my husband got the chicken parmesan. The food literally came out five minutes after we ordered, which was a bit odd, but overall it was good. I give the sauce a B+, but the food overall more like a B-. The baked ziti did not have ricotta in it, which typically it does. Basically it was a bowl of pasta with some mozzarella melted on top. My husband's response to \"how is it?\" about his meal was \"it's ok.\"  At the end of the day, I'll give Giuseppe's another try, but I can't rave about it the way others have.",

    "text": "This was our first time visiting Giuseppe's and consider the restaurant to be an outstanding place for Italian food. I'm Italian and was raised on high quality fresh/homemade Italian food. As always when evaluating a new Italian Restaurant, I order the spaghetti & meatballs to test: 1.freshness/quality/ratios of the ingredients coupled with how well cooked and seasoned. 2. presentation and temperature. 3. last but not least...over-all value. I have eaten spaghetti & meatballs all over the USA and Italy and must say the marinara sauce is some of the best I've ever tasted and the meatball IS the best I've ever tasted (better than my mom's). It's a casual atmosphere with a gregarious owner (Pasquale) who made us feel at home and was very attentive to our needs. The pasta was cooked perfectly, portion size was just right and the value of the meal was higher than the cost. By the way, it is cash only. No complaints...We will definitely be back and sample the other homemade dishes. Thank you Pasquale for providing our neighborhood with great Italian food...it is a find. Ray Fox",

    "text": "First time having dinner here although I have done take out sandwiches. Upon seating, I saw a woman eating a delicious looking pasta with red sauce and asked the server what it was.  It was Mostaccioli.  Yup, I wanted that.  Ordered a meatball on the side to find out what kind of meatballs they made.  Another person ordered linguini alfredo and hubby ordered his old stand by: eggplant and chicken combo which came with pasta on the side.  First they served some rustic italian bread that I liked but hubby thought was stale.  Not too stale though.  Good enough that two of us ate it without too much complaint.  It came with a garlicky herb butter that everybody liked.  Do you know that hunger makes stale bread go away?  The Mostaccioli came out looking amazing and if looking amazing was not enough, it tasted like it had been made by the Gods. It was cooked al dente perhaps more like al dentissimo, but really, really good.  The linguini alfredo was magnificent  (I was allowed to taste it only because everybody wanted to taste my amazing pasta!).  And then..... there is the story of the eggplant/chicken combo.  Firstly, the chicken was overcooked and then the most offensive of it all was that it had an over-refrigerated taste.  Have you ever kept something in the refrigerator so long that the flavors from the other foods permeated it?  Yup,  I tasted it and assured hubby that he was not going to get food poisoning that it was just a case of \"we kept the chicken in the fridge too long.\" The overcooking, in my humble culinary opinion, is that the eggplant and the chicken are both pre-cooked and when an order comes in they put the sauce and cheese on it and then reheat it in a salamander or the oven. (IN MY HUMBLE OPINION).  So the mood was not so light at our table tonight.  You know that when the chief is not happy it is not a good thing.   But the chief was really nice about it and didn't say anything to the staff about the chicken.  Next scenario. I had my heart set on having some tiramisu so I called over the server and asked him about the tiramisu.  I was concerned about having old desserts served to me.  He went on and on about how the desserts are made by so-and so's wife and they are fresh, fresh, fresh,  etc etc etc.  As he went through his litany of desserts, he mentioned flourless chocolate cake which hubby loves.  I figured that I would make up for his bad meal by getting him the chocolate cake.  So I said, we'll have the tiramisu and the chocolate cake and almost in an arrogant, insulted fashion, he said: I'll continue telling you about the gelatos.  The fact that I already told him what I wanted was of no consequence.  He continued his litany of gelato flavors almost like Forrest Gump's buddy Bubba did as he called off the shrimp dishes from all corners of the earth.  I waited for his conclusion painfully, hoping he would turn around and get our desserts.  He did.  Finally.   Next scenario. He arrived with 3 dishes.  One with the flourless cake which was to brighten my \"sunshine's\" day and provide relief to the disappointment of his meal.  Another had all whipped cream in it which we were to share.  And the third dish was a \"cannoli???\"   Wait, wait........ wait.......  let me look more closely.....no,  it's not a small cannoli.  it's... it's.... OMG.... it's our tiramisu!!!! A tiramisu the size of a cannoli, I KID YOU NOT.  Too bad I didn't take a photo of it.  Two lady fingers (used to make tiramisu) was the extent of the tiramisu.  Never ever have we seen anything like this before.  Could have easily been one bite except I am too much of a lady to do that in a restaurant.  If I had been home with a tiramisu of that size, I would have bent my head backwards like a seal and scarfed down the entire piece in one bite.  And then to make it worse, hubby compared the flourless chocolate cake to others I have brought home for him and it did not meet his standard.  Bust #2. Score:  0-0 .  Next scenario. We get the bill and it is a slip of paper with a total amount due, non-itemized,  a few names of the dishes scribbled down but no prices-Just the total due.  Reminds me of the bills Tony Soprano used to get at his favorite haunt except that Tony didn't have to pay.  How do I know if my bill was correct?  I don't.  Do I have to sit there with a calculator??  Maybe.  And maybe someone else, not me.   Don't know what to say except that my pasta dish was amazing.  The question is whether all the other bad stuff that happened during this dinner can be made up by even the best of pastas.",

Working in many restaurants in the past I can tell you that the chicken piccata which should be made to order and is normally made with thin chicken breast medallions, was premade(possibly a day in advanced).  It was a large breaded chicken breast that was dropped in the fryer to order.  The outside was fried but inside the chicken was cold and dried out like it had been precooked and sitting in the cooler for some time.  Are you kidding me???  Really?  Pre-made.  Italian chefs I know would be rolling on the ground.   The pasta was ok at best.    Nothing to stand up and shout over.  I am glad I did not get sick.  I will never go back to that place.  I question the dining experiences of these past reviews but oh yeah that's right its Scottsdale.  The New Yorker's think this is good? You got to be kidding me.   Really?",

Doesn't charge a decorking fee but MAKE SURE you have enough wine for the boss. It's a small restaurant that adds to the cozy dining experience but the food is definitely big time. Bring an appetite. Portions are tasty and generous. My personal favorite is Pasta Alex. A little bit spicy. Just the way i like it. Everyone who visits me from back east gets to have dinner at Giuseppe's. Manhattans Little Italy and the Bronx Arthur Avenues would be proud of this place.",

    "text": "Mmmmm  mmmmm mmmmm.  OMG.  Where do I start? When I was little, we lived next door to an old Italian couple.  The wife would cook \"gravy\" every week and once in awhile she would invite us over to have some pasta and gravy.  Well, let just say, eating pasta at Giuseppe's was like visiting my childhood all over again.  I hadn't had gravy like this since I was a kid.  This place was so good that I went there two days in a row last week.  The menu is very simple and the pasta is cooked to al dente perfection.  On my first trip, I ordered chicken parm with a side of mostaciolli.    The second trip we tried the Pasta Alex which was very good and the Italian sausage.  They made up plates of spaghetti with butter and parm for the kids.  It is very kid friendly.  And on the way out, my kids were given complimentary Italian ices from the owner Pasquale.   Love this place!!!!  Oh, and it is BYOB!!!  :)",

For a dinner of garlic bread, and 2 supposedly $8 entrees, one with extra chicken, and one entree of  ravioli for 14, i got the cheque for $52 and when we requested for an itemized bill, the one that was supposed to be $8  they charged $18 for that just for adding chicken!!!!!! Dont think we will ever be going back there !!",

    "text": "We went here last night for my brothers b-day. We have heard great things about this place and were very excited. We get there and there was two cars in the parking lot. We almost left and went somewhere else just cause it was 6pm on a sat. night and  we were not sure about it. At the end of the strip mall there is a wine store and bar, so we grabbed 2 bottels of wine and  we went in and sat down( This is a BYOB place). We started off with an antipasto and bread and it was great. Loaded with ham, salami, prosciutto, capocollo, green beans artichoke hearts and fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. By this time the resaurant was getting busy. Also the owner came in about 6:45 or so and thats when things got fun. His name is Pasquale and he treats everybody like they are family. He is very nice and very funny. We started to notice that everyone there were regulars. And now we can seee why. I dont care what you say customer service is very important and it will keep people comming back. For dinner everyone tried something different so we could all try everything. I ordered the stuffed tortellini. It was stuffed with chicken, ricota cheese and in a tomato cream sauce. This sauce was friggin awesome. The linguini with clams in a  white sauce was delish. The meetballs, sausage & peppers was great and the stuffed peppers were to die for. My mom got the Chicken Parmigiana it was huge and it was great and very moist inside.   All the desserts are made fresh by Pasquale's wife. We tried the chocolate cake, tiramisu, and the cannoli. All the desserts were so good and you knew they were fresh. This place is a great little place and you will feel at home. Its small inside and not fancy at all, they except cash only and it is a BYOB restaurant. Great food and even better prices. If you meet Pasquale ask about his special apron, but only if your not easily offended. lol",

    "text": "From what I read on Yelp, I was expecting a great meal.  From the standpoint of an experience, Ristorante Giuseppe is fantastic.  It is a tiny family-owned place with an unforgettable wait staff.  Also, it's BYOB with no corkage fee, which is a huge plus in my eyes.  It feels like you're dining in someone's house, great family atmosphere.    The menu is very simple, your classical Italian fare.  Priced at about $15 an entree, I expected excellent food.  I had the cioppino and was very disappointed.  Granted, I spend half my time in the Bay Area and have access to the freshest seafood.  Still, this was clearly average ingredients being used.  Also, there was significantly too much pasta in my dish (as opposed to a True cioppino, which is more a seafood stew).  My group also ordered the chicken parmigiana (again, decent but not great) and the pork ribs parmigiana (a very interesting dish I had not seen before).  Also had the soup of the day which was excellent, the highlight of the food.  This is a good change of pace, a nice hole in the wall restaurant with a dedicated group of regulars who know the owners well.  However, the food is not as good as one might expect from previous Yelp reviews.  Maybe I caught them on a bad day, but I will not be returning anytime soon.  Also, it loses points from the shocking number of smokers right outside the restaurant.  We ate outside, and several guests regularly took smoke breaks about 12 feet from our table.  This was not the best complement to the dining experience.",

This is a family owned strip mall restaurant that would be quite a find if the prices were about half of what they are.  The food here is pretty good but not the best I've ever had.  The place looks and feels like a budget Italian restaurant (plastic tablecloths, paper napkins, cheap furniture, cheesy decor).  The portions are pretty small too -- I'm a skinny guy but I was still hungry when I finished eating.  And yet, dinner for two (just two pasta entrees + soft drinks) cost north of $40 before the tip.  And yes, that's no appetizers, no salads, no deserts, and no exotic ingredients.  Just not worth the price they're charging.",

So glad we decided to take a chance on this little hole in the wall. I have to say, this restaurant has the best pasta dishes I've had in the states.  I can honestly only recall one other pasta dish I had that was better, and that was in Florence, Italy. The waiter was great, very kind.  Service was incredibly prompt.  He made some great recommendations to us on which dish to choose. The atmosphere of the place is the only part where I think they might be able to improve, and they wouldn't have to do much.  It's still great- small, family owned/operated, byob was very fun; I just felt that if they perhaps dressed it up just a bit with the decor it would add more sparkle to this gem.  But I loved how it was so small, only a handful of tables, very relaxed and casual.  Overall- best Italian food in AZ, especially for the price.  I will absolutely be returning.",

This reminds me of countless small mom and pop's back in The City.  The staff is friendly, the portions sizable and the check small to medium.  In fact, I can't believe I haven't reviewed this restaurant before.  Whether on a date, or with the family, I've never had a bad experience in the dozens of times I've been there.  From the veal parmagian (sp?) to the eggplant, from the fettucine to the spaghetti and meatbeals... mama mia.  It is a small venue, with very limited outdoors seating during good weather.  And the locals know about it, so it gets pretty packed Thursday through Sunday.  The salads and appetizers are delicious as well...

In fact, it's suprisingly affordable for how good it is.  It's just a little neighborhood Italian joint, and it's damn fine.  I think you can bring your own wine too, but I'm not positivo.  Call ahead and check, and ask about a corking fee too.  I just had a soda that night (I know, shocker!) but next time I will definitely be bringing some vino if that's really the case.  I had the tortellini and it was absolutely delish.  My boyfriend had ravioli that he loved, but I couldn't try it because it had meat in it.  We both had the homemade cannolis and they were worth every bite.   This is one of my new favorite restaurants, and I bet it's going to be yours too!",

I ha e not eaten here in about a year so we were happy to celebrate at one of our old favorites. When we got the bill, it seemed quite high. There was no itemized charges on the bill, in which never bothered us in the past,but since it seemed high, we all agreed to maybe ask the owner to itemize the bill. He did. And it didn't add up, in fact it was wrong. Instead of correcting the issue, he became very defensive and lashed out at us. When he added it himself he came up with three different totals. It made no sense, this definitely was not the same owner we remembered, patting our children on the heads, thanking customers proudly. This place has gone down hill, not only in the food, but the customer service and experience itself. We will never go bad. It went from an old favorite, to just, well, old news.",

Alessandro's special is essentially a chicken piccata... the chicken was a bit dry, but the sauce was well prepared, it had just the right amount of citrus and capers and not overly sour or salty like most other places prepare it. The eggplant dish was awesome! Normally, the eggplant parmesan I get  is a little mushy, but it wasn't too dry or soggy here.   What else can I say? I love this place.",

After moving several times and finally settling in to the 85254 neighborhood, I was elated to find the new Giuseppe's at the Scottsdale Rd/Thunderbird location. This place is THE BEST Italian restaurant this side of Chicago! You can pay more at the \"other\" Italian restaurant a few doors down, but nothing beats the family recipes at Giuseppe's that make these meals delectable.  Bottom line, this place makes the best sauce in town! The veal, the eggplant rolletini and the eggplant parmesan will all satisfy you and make you want to return again and again! Their desserts are mouth watering and their prices fair. The fact that you can bring your own bottle of wine with no cork fee is even better! I also LOVE the fact that the family is warm and friendly and speaks Italian to all of the other Italian families visiting the restaurant. This restaurant has a very Chicago/East Coast Italian feel....warm, inviting and mouth watering!!  PS-The Mrs. makes FABULOUS cannoli's!!   Mangia!!!",
