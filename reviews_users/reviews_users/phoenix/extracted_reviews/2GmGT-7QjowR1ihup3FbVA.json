The chicken shawerma plate is huge and the hummus is wonderfully smooth. My sole complaint is that the takeout \"line\" is kind of haphazard and random instead of our polite and orderly Western queues; put it down to cultural differences.",

    "text": "Quick, no frill restaurant situated in a Mediterranean/Arabic grocery store. Had lunch here my first day in Tempe and the food kept me fueled for the rest of the day. Ordered the beef shawarma and it was quite good. I think the chicken might've been better as some pieces of the beef had been cooked too long and had that mealy texture. The dish usually came with salad, rice, and Arabic bread, but I don't eat grains so just asked for more salad. It was a big dish. The dressing on the salad was tasty, and even though it was mostly iceberg lettuce, I was fine with it this time. The beef came topped with ample tahini sauce. I ate about 3/4 of it and took the rest with me. Dinner for the night taken care of!  My total came out to $8 something including tax. Pretty good for a quick, tasty yet filling lunch.   When I was leaving saw that they have lamb tongue as a sandwich. I wonder if they would make that into a plate dish instead of a sandwich...I bet that's delicious!",

Both very tasty and great portions!   While he was checking out, I was checking out the grocery part of the place. LOVED IT! I am hoping to get back soon to get some more shawarma seasonings :) Def worth the visit...",

    "text": "Haji-Baba was recently profiled on the television show \"CHECK PLEASE ARIZONA\" and after the great reviews they got on the tv, we had to try it. This was our BEST \"check please\" experience to date!  THE FOOD: make plans to go more than once, because even with the combination plates, you'll want to go back again and again until you've tasted it all! Yes, yes, the Chicken Shawerma is ah-may-zing! And yes, the portion sizes are very big (most folks leave with to-go boxes, but it's also hard not to over-order with such tasty offerings all over the menu). But the combination plates, in my opinion, are the way to go. It's not just a little bit of this and that... it's a full serving of this and that, and everything is so delicious, you'll be amazed with every bit. From the warm, delicious stuffed grape leaves to the hummous to the kebabs to, well, everything!  THE DRINKS: I have to mention this briefly... I'm an iced tea fan and the tea here is wonderful. They are always so busy, I haven't slowed someone down to ask what the slightly sweet flavor is, but it's the tea itself, not a sweetener. Yum!  THE SHOP: the building is 2/3 restaurant, 1/3 store... don't forget to pick up some truly fantastic baklava and/or turkish delight at the back counter register when you pay after your meal... it may be the best sweet treats you've ever had.  WHEN TO GO: they get busy and you may have to wait a few minutes, but because they are also a store, you can browse the aisles for european/asian cookies and tea and such while you're waiting... and its all worth the wait. so really, it isn't when to go, it's why haven't you already? the chefs in the kitchen are masterful and the staff will make you feel right at home... and, of course, it's likely to be some of the best food you've ever had!",

Think along the lines of $6-10 for massive dinner combo plates and $3 for appetizers. Even their import store is cheap.   Some star features:  -Enormous portions -Incredible food -Wonderful arabic coffee -You can buy a massive block of fresh feta for like $7 -Delicious rosewater lemonade -'Exotic' spices for less than $2 for a massive bag. -Imported chocolate for only a few cents more than domestic chocolate costs.  -See above: They have nestle kitkats instead of the inferior american hershey kitkats  My wife and I eat out constantly and this is absolutely in our top 3 restaurants in the entire valley.",

At first glance, it looked like any other store in a strip mall but inside, it is divided into a store front & a restaurant. The space is clean & the service is excellent/attentive.   our lunch consisted of a vegetarian combo plate(falafel x2, baba ganouj, tabbouleh, grape leaves x2) shish kabob plate(lamb kabob x5 pieces,rice, lettuce salad with tahini,1 Arabic bread) side of labni( kind of cream cheese), ful mudammas (mix of beans in a flavored curry sauce)- yes we were really hungry :) In the veggie combo- The falafel was crispy, freshly made & grape leaves were unlike any I have eaten. The ful mudammas was tasty, well prepared/flavored without being spicy. In case of the shish kabob plate- the lamb was well cooked (I asked for medium done meat & that's what I was served) but it was bland. The portions are huge but prices are reasonable .  Don't miss picking up some yummy middle eastern desserts from the store, to finish up your meal.   We left Haji Baba, stuffed/content & with lotsa doggie bags!",

I love the chicken schwerma plate and sandwich like everyone else who commented.  So much so, I bought the spice they sell in their grocery side of the building.  They do it so much better.    It's always packed during lunch time.  I work close by  and find that it is just as fast to go there and order my chicken schwerma sandwich to go, without a call in,  as it does for Jimmy John's sandwich to arrive, which is only half a mile away.  Haji-Baba wins, hands down the better sandwich and better price of $3.89.  This is usually True if there are not people waititng in line to pay for their shopping cart full of groceries.  How does that happen?  The aisles barely fit 2 people in it.  Anyways, if you've never tried it, you're in for real treat.  It is also a great place to buy spices, olive oil, lemon juice and try new things.",

    "text": "There are two distinct kinds of friends who have given me their accounts of Haji Baba, a long-time Middle Eastern culinary institution in Tempe: Arizona natives/ASU alums, and Middle Easterners.  Arizona natives/ASU alums: Why do you go to all these other Middle Eastern places? Haji Baba is the best! The best, I tell you. Are you even listening to me? It's awesome! And cheap! I'd go there after Econ 102 every Tuesday and Thursday. No need to go to any of these other places, see? Haji Baba is the best. Now, go!  Middle Easterners: My friend, why do you want to go here? How is it, you ask me? Meh. It is just ok food. They give you a lot of food, but nothing tasting very special, you know? If you go here, just do your shopping and eat somewhere else.  And with those distinct camps of opinion, it's no wonder that it took 21 months for me to set foot in here. But I finally did so a few nights ago...  Haji Baba is another store/restaurant hybrid, which seems to be the M.O. of most Middle Eastern establishments here in the Valley. The store, to the left-hand side, had a pretty good-sized selection of Middle Eastern goods, except you can obviously tell that this place is right by a college campus, with the near-entirety of one long shelving unit dedicated to every flavor of hookah tobacco known to man. I didn't spot a durian, rhubarb, or garlic-flavored tobacco during my initial scan, but I'm sure they were in there somewhere.  The separate dining area is to the right, except for two small tables on the store-side of the wall. Which is where the waiter decided to seat me, even though there were open tables of equal size in the dining area. I thought this was a little odd. Was I being sequestered for some reason? I didn't think I looked disheveled, but what do I know.   Anyway, I ordered some baba ganoush with pita for appetizer and then the chicken shawarma combination plate for entree. I'll agree about the prices. They did seem very reasonable (the combination plate was $6-something). Also, they had choices of either Arabic-style or Persian-style kabobs, which I pretty much never see in the same restaurant.   As I waited for my food, I was given a tall, frosted plastic cup full of ice water. The problem was, though, that the cup was so tall that my accompanying straw completely disappeared as soon as I dropped it in. Oh well.  My baba ganush arrived and it looked really great. However, the taste was so mild that you could barely distinguish it from hummus. You'd have no inkling whatsoever that this was eggplant mush. It had none of the smoky, slightly bitter flavor that baba ganush is known for. Which is fine. Maybe milder, meeker, less potentially offensive flavors are the way to go in a college setting, but I was a little disappointed.  Then came my chicken shawarma entree, which had a sizeable pile of the aforementioned chicken plus hummus, tabbouleh, rice, and more pita. I could see how as a college student that this would be a great value. Even as a working professional, this was still good value. In front of me was a lot of food for not much money. They were generous with the amount of chicken they gave, a rare sight in many of these restaurants. But again, hoping for amazing things, I was underwhelmed by the taste of each of the elements. Not that any of the items tasted bad, but that their flavors were more muted than other Middle Eastern establishments I've been to in the Valley, which I can say now is more than a small handful.   That said, Haji Baba did succeed in one thing - too *much* food. I was so full that I left with a lot of my rice and pita left over, which pretty much never happens.   So in the end, what do I make of this crowded, local ASU favorite?   5 words: It is ok, my friend.  3 stars.",

    "text": "I used to go here a lot. The owners still know my name when I pop in on the occasional shopping visit, which I love. The only reason why I don't go more often is lack of funds.  I am in love with their chicken shwarma and chicken kabobs.  I don't eat red meat, so I cannot comment on their beef dishes, but my son LOVES them. I always order their Arabic coffee.  It's not Turkish, as some people have written.  Turkish coffee is made with a different spice, but the technique is the same. Either way, I love the Arabic coffee here.  I would give them five stars, but their hummus can be too salty at times. Maybe they are using canned hummus, don't know and I hope they don't.  Also their tabouleh usually is dripping with lemon and that's too much for me. The bulgur should soak up just enough to flavor and still be dry.   Here you will also find a great, but quaint, grocery store. Their pricing is awesome and I love the selections of spices, herbs and teas. Their feta is fresh and priced so well that I refuse to buy it anywhere else. They also offer various kitchen items that are priced very reasonably as well.  I've bought my tea and coffee sets from there and my cutting boards. They have a good, not huge, but decent selection of shisha also. This is my one-stop-shop for my Middle Eastern groceries.",

It's a corner grocery.  It's a family-run restaurant.  It's freaking good.    The hummus is pretty good, with fresh-made pita.  The feta cheese app is really good.  The chicken shawerma plate is top-notch, and my god is there a ton of food.  Heck, order the gyros plate for around $6 and when it arrives, mounds of succulent meat, tzsaziki sauce, rice and Greek salad, go ahead and take a bite before you decide to pull a Johnny Depp from Once Upon a Time in Mexico and go back to kill the cook because it's just too good.    It's cheap, it's filling, it's quality, and it's ridiculous that it's not packed from open to close.    Good ol' Haji Baba.",

    "text": "I've eaten here a couple of times before.  The first time, less than two years ago, I ordered the chicken shawarma entree (complete with pickled veggies, hummus, garlic sauce, and pita).  Many of the chicken pieces were still uncooked that I could hardly chew it, and some were still blood-red!  When I started to complain about about this to my server, he acted as if no one has ever complained about the food here before.  He left, and he came back with whom I thought was the cook, who had acted even more offended about my accusation of the meat being uncooked.  He mentioned something about how everything is timed perfectly in the oven, but he offered to bring a new dish out.  Twelve minutes later (yes, I time these things), a slightly more cooked dish of chicken was laid out in front of me.  I decided I'd salvage what I could and just chalk it up to a bad day.  My favorite things in that entree were the pickled veggies and the garlic sauce.  Oh my... the garlic sauce!!    A few days after that, I brought my Mom with me for dinner.  We ordered the lamb kabob entree to share.  She wasn't impressed with the kabobs, since she had Byblos' lamb shanks on the brain (Byblos' lamb is pretty good, we think).  It was official- the hummus here leaves much to be desired.  However, I still thought the garlic sauce was fantastic!  Tastes great with the tabouli/tabouleh (both are correct).  Fast-forward many, many months to two days ago, I decided to order take-out for Mom and me- chicken shawarma sandwich, no pickle (tomatoes, lettuce, and garlic sauce in pita); gyro, no pickle, no cucumber sauce (lamb meat and lettuce in pita); and gyro with everything for Mom.  Why did it take me all this time to finally order these sandwiches to-go?  Both types are must-tries: the shawarma is a popular choice of many here, and all it takes is one bite for you to know why.  The sauce and garlic schmear combo is to-die-for!  And one would think that a pita with only lamb meat and lettuce sounds too simple to be so tasty, but it is!  The meat is so moist and tender, you really don't need any condiment.  Trust me.  Heck, don't trust me and order one plain and one with the works and judge them yourself; Most of the sandwiches costs less than $4 each!    BTW, you may elect to have whole wheat pita instead of the plain normally used.  You may also take Haji-Baba pitas home (made at the Haji-Baba bakery on Apache east of the restaurant); you may find them on the register counter.    You may pay for your take-out in advance and then wait for it to be prepared, or you may want to check out the grocery aisles as you're waiting and pay for everything at the end.  I suggest the chocoholics check out the Swiss chocolate bars here!  I've tried a few brands, and I just love the Milka brand: milk chocolate with whole hazelnut, milk and creamy white layered, plain milk chocolate.  (I love dark chocolate, but couldn't find one allergen-free.)  The flavors are so creamy and you can definitely taste the great quality ingredients used.  There are cheaper brands sold here, but a not-so-quick glance (you may or may not find English among the five or so languages listed on the back) will reveal that other vegetable fat, not cocoa butter, is used.  Go for the \"good chocolate\" brands; At two dollars or less a bar, you can leave with a goodie cache without having to spend much cash.    You'll most likely find something in the grocery you'll want to buy, so don't forget to remember to pick up your take-out order.  The chances of you forgetting about food, however, are slim since that is all you'll be thinking of the moment you walk into the place... the food aromas are mouth-watering!",

I have probably tried most of the menu and never ever had a bad experience, but will admit that I probably fall back on the falafel sandwich more than half the time I go to Haji-Baba.  It really is the best falafel in town.  Additional tip, pick up some decadent baklava (several varieties) or other freshly made Mediterranean pastries and a package of the best pitas in town, along with some other ethnic groceries on your way out.  My promise: you will be happy to know about this place once you try it out.",

    "text": "Well I guess I'm going to be in the minority here and say that I was somewhat disappointed.  Not too much, but a little.  It is ridiculously inexpensive, and for the money, I thought the food was decent.  We started with the homus.  I didn't think it was great, but it was okay.  The pita bread it was served with was nothing special, similar to the pita pockets from any supermarket.  The Arabic bread my lunch was served with was much better, a soft flat bread.  I had the chicken shawarma plate which was served with rice and tabouli.  The tabouli was very good, although I don't much care for tabouli in general...or rice.  So I'm not sure why I ordered the plate instead of the sandwich.  Maybe I just wanted to see more food on my plate.  That sounds like me.  The flavor of the shawarma was good, but I was really disappointed in the chicken.  It was everything from larger chunks of meat to itty bitty little scraps, mostly scraps.  But again, dirt cheap so you can only complain so much.  We also browsed in the grocery part and picked up some packaged goodies and 2 pieces of baklava.  Probably some of the best baklava I have had!  They were out of the pecan variety, but there was also almond, pistachio, and cashew to choose from.  It was something crazy like a buck a piece.  Overall, I'm glad we went, and I would go again.  But I don't know I would go out of my way unless their dinner menu is different than the lunch menu, or I was seeking out the baklava.",

Before becoming a vegetarian, my favorite thing to get here was the chicken shwarma plate - and although I have a huge appetite, I still was able to take plenty home for the next day. Now, a falafel plate or pita is the way to satisfy my hunger! Make sure to try their hummous and tabouli! Their baklava is unbelievably good - the almond and pecan varieties are my favorites.   Be sure to check out the grocery section as well - super cheap bulk spices, rice, and legumes (lentils, etc); as well as lots of items necessary for middle eastern and indian cooking.   In all of my years of eating here, I've only once had to wait longer than ten minutes for my food. Usually, it takes less than five, sometimes less than three minutes of time between when I place my order and when it's making its way into my stomach.The employees and servers here are some of the nicest people I've ever met. It only takes a few visits for them to remember you and your favorite thing to eat. I can't recommend Haji Baba's enough.",

    "text": "Damn you Yelpers you steered me wrong!!  I agreed to go to this place only after reading all of these glorious reviews on Yelp, only to be in for a rude awakening upon my arrival.    I hate to be the bearer of bad news, but the phrase you get what you pay for has never rang more True for me.  I love Middle Eastern food, like seriously, no joke.  So how excited was I to try a new Middle Eastern restaurant not too far from my office with ridiculously low prices?? You can probably figure it out from there.  The meal started out okay.  I got a pretty darn big piece of Spanakopita for $1.95, which excited me.  It was decent, not very flavorful to be honest but for $1.95 I'll eat them all day long. My boss ordered a side of hummus to start, and his story was pretty much the same.  We then both ordered the Chicken Kabob sandwich for a whopping $3.99 and I was stoked. Until it arrived that is.  I took one bite and could tell right away that something was not right, with the chicken I mean.  After I taste a funky piece of meat, that's it. I will not be taking another bite. It just won't happen.  I did however perform a little surgery on one piece on a side plate to discover that as I suspected, the inside was pink, as in NOT FULLY COOKED.  It took a bit out of me to not get sick right there at the table.  I was hungry though so I tried to eat around the chicken, only to discover that this was the dryest chicken kabob sandwich I had ever had.  I probably should've figured that out by watching my boss douse his with the entire appetizer of hummus to add some flavor, but what can I say, I like to figure some things out on my own.  All in all my meal ending up costing less than $6, which was sweet, except for the fact that I didn't really eat anything.  Oh, and I should probably mention that we got back to the office and my boss didn't stop bitching all afternoon about how badly his stomach hurt. I believe that's called salmonella : )  Anyways, I'm a bit surprised that I had such a lousy experience with so many great reviews before me.  Maybe it was an off day, maybe all the reviewers before me were blinded by the price, regardless, I won't be back to find out.",

Well to be completely honest I'm pretty sure anything you order here you cant go wrong.  To make it simple:  Food: Plates are quite big so if you aren't starving to death prepare to take some home or share it with a friend. I like ordering the gyro sandwich, chicken shish kabob, side of grape leaves. Those are just the items I have continually ordered I am positive there are many more wonderful items to try as well.  Food is always fresh and authentic.  Also, buy their Turkish delight. It is fresh and quite possibly the best Turkish delight i have ever had ( no exaggeration) !  Price: Prices here are very economical; For both the restaurant  and the store section. They have a lot of goodies throughout the store that are hard to find other places.  Customer service: This is a family owned business and it is run accordingly. The employees here are very kind and efficient. I feel like they value their customers and that is important to me.  Even when I have been here and it is quite crowded I have never had to wait too long.   SO long story short. If you haven't been here GO! Don't waste anytime reading any more reviews or pondering just go straight here, You will not regret it ! Thanks Haji Baba",

Although lacking a bit of ambiance, eat here and it may just inspire you to make your own hummus, tabouli or falafel.  This is why Haji-Baba is a one stop affair: after your meal, pop over to the grocery side and grab the needed items (some found nowhere else) to whip up your own creation.    Don't feel like making the food yourself?  Call them, even with short notice, and you can please a hungry crowd and wow them with tasty morsels of delicious homemade food.  Or just get take-out and call it good!  It is worth the drive or a visit.  Light rail stops right out front, bike parking is nearby. Uber your way here and you will be glad you did!

Over the years I recommend and brought friends or family along. The price is reasonable and their service has been quick and friendly!",

We decided to try it because the pictures of the food looked promising.   At first sight of the restaurant, we were surprised because it was a restaurant / grocery store hybrid. We found it interesting but were intrigued.   The chicken shawarma plate for $9 was delicious and filling. The chicken had a lot of flavor, the pita bread was warm, and the garlic sauce was strong, just the way I prefer any garlic sauce. The tangy tabouli and moist rice were good complements to the meal as well.  Also, our waiter was very friendly and accommodating! You go up to the register at the end of the meal to individually pay for your food which makes it convenient and easy to dutch pay when youre with friends.   I definitely recommend this place!",

After receiving hummus with a teaspoon of olive oil, I asked if I could get some on the side. At first glance I immediately knew what was in the side dish was not olive oil. I smelt it--Nothing. No smell. I tasted it. Gross. Cooking oil. F*cking cooking oil. I buy olive oil. I lived in Lebanon for some time. The fact that the hummus only had a teaspoon of olive oil was irritating in itself. I could go on...  If you can't give me real olive oil, don't give me anything at all--or tell me I'd have to pay for it. Whatever. Don't give me sunflower oil and try to convince me that this is olive oil.   Simply because I am a white American DOES NOT mean I don't know what the difference between cooking oil & olive oil is. I'm offended and disgusted. If you are looking for authentic Middle Eastern food, you are better off elsewhere. Support an honest businessman that has some integrity because it is clearly lacking here.",

Possibly it's just the shawarmas. We had ordered the chicken shawarma and it was served in a wrap with lettuce and chicken drizzled with a mayo based sauce. The chicken was good but it wasn't the real shawarma I was looking forward to knowing that this is a Mediterranean place. One of the striking characteristics of shawarma is the toum sauce which was missing here. Might come back again to try the kebabs before I completely makeup my mind on this place",

The sandwich was not that great. The chicken was dry and overcooked and while it was grilled, it tasted more like dried out hunks from the bottom of a pan. The sauce they added was all that saved my lunch. I would have sent it back at another place, but after all the disciple reviews, I felt guilty for not liking it. Maybe I got an off batch of chicken.   My friend tried the beef shawarma plate. The beef was also overcooked and dry and the rice had a flavor that hit your nose like a fish tank. I'm really not being mean or snarky. It smelled like fish tank water. Taste was okay.  Place was packed, so it's a popular spot, but I won't hurry back. Service was fast. Prices were reasonable. Store has some cool items.   I was disappointed after so many great reviews.",

This is definitely my favorite gyro joint, and one of my favorite all around restaurants.  Get the hummus, be sure to specifically ask for the home made pita, it's always perfect. If you get gyros, go big, get the Gyros DLX. It includes feta (a whole lot) and more meat. It's fucking great.  The atmosphere is very \"hole in the wall\" but that can be a good thing I think. The people who work there are friendly and very good at \"reading\" their customers. You never get over or under served, no matter your mood or who you're with.  If you're visiting town, stop by Haji. If you live here, why haven't you gone already? If you have, why aren't you going there now?",

I am in love with their chicken shwarma and chicken kabobs.  I don't eat red meat, so I cannot comment on their beef dishes, but my son LOVES them. I always order their Arabic coffee.  It's not Turkish, as some people have written.  Turkish coffee is made with a different spice, but the technique is the same. Either way, I love the Arabic coffee here.  I would give them five stars, but their hummus can be too salty at times. Maybe they are using canned hummus, don't know and I hope they don't.  Also their tabouleh usually is dripping with lemon and that's too much for me. The bulgur should soak up just enough to flavor and still be dry.   Here you will also find a great, but quaint, grocery store. Their pricing is awesome and I love the selections of spices, herbs and teas. Their feta is fresh and priced so well that I refuse to buy it anywhere else. They also offer various kitchen items that are priced very reasonably as well.  I've bought my tea and coffee sets from there and my cutting boards. They have a good, not huge, but decent selection of shisha also. This is my one-stop-shop for my Middle Eastern groceries.",

The chicken is soooo moist and perfectly grilled. Just simply amazing. I always ask for extra garlic sauce for dipping. One of the most amazing and flavorful dipping sauce. Only one negative comment: the pita is chewy sometimes. Maybe this is just my personal preference but certainly not a big deal that would keep me from coming back.   -keep eatin'",

My boyfriend and I split the non-veggie combination platter, and everything was fantastic: the falafel was light and fluffy, on par with the NY street vendor fare I'm accustomed to, and the gyro was so delicious that I managed to finagle 3/4 of it away before he noticed there'd been more under a piece of hummus-y lettuce.  I would not recommend it for a first date -- hipper joints like Pita Jungle across the street would better fit the bill -- but if you're in a comfortable relationship and craving a delicious meal after a long day's ridiculous lightrail experiment, Haji-Baba's got your back.  And your belly...",

I don't get to go here that often since it's a little far away, and until recently the light rail construction traffic made getting there a pain. But when I do I get that chicken shawerma and I tell myself I can eat all of it. Then I eat half of it and box the rest of it up and have a delicious lunch the next day.

It was always busy and the service was authentic and the food was authentic (at least all my engineering middle-eastern friends would say). Their hummus was outstanding and this place introduced me to my favorite dish, lamb kefta.  So I was in the neighborhood yesterday and decided to re-live that experience.  They still use good pitas, but the kefta was not how it used to be (they don't even offer lamb kefta anymore, just ground beef!).  The hummus was good, but it lacked the clean taste of a good oil (they may have gone cheap and used canola oil instead of evoo).  The kefta sandwich was soggy and loaded with the lowest quality lettuce I've seen in a while.  I did grab a few market items (always have been reliably stocked), but I was very disappointed with the food.  Let me add that when I used to go there, this place was always busy w/ middle easterners - both as clients and as the servers.  Now, it's nothing like that (it's all non-middle easterners).  I'm just thinking it's lost its authenticity, ergo the change in customer demographics.",

    "text": "What an absolute delight!   Stepping into the tiny grocery/cafe, i was washed in delicious smells of curry and every imaginable spice. My dad chose this place for dinner as it conveniently sells leg of lamb (our family's traditional Christmas eve main course).   Myself, my dad & mom, my sister and 7-year old niece found a relatively comfortable table and set up shop. While we waited for menus, my sister & I eagerly gazed at the shelves of exotic foods just a few paces away. After selecting a wide variety of menu items, my sister and I bolted for the grocery area while my dad entertained my niece.   My sister found some curry pastes and I goggled at the biryani rice mix, the watermelon jam, and the super-cheap olive oil. I love places like this!   Our meal came quite quickly, so we barely made it through the 3 small aisles. We rushed back to the table to dig in.   I ordered a gyro on the side to keep for lunch the next day (was it really $3.50 for this massive thing??) My mom ordered a falafel sandwich (she's a vegetarian most of the time), dad started in on his shwarma sandwich (the beef was shredded and tasted like machaca; very flavorful!). My niece is a picky eater but our server accommodated and instructed the kitchen to create a \"chicken-on-a-stick.\" She had a disbelieving, almost grossed-out, expression on her face when it was placed before her (it was basted in a mild yellow curry). After trying the meat, she devoured most of it (we were SO proud!).   The piece d' resistance was the combo platter that my sis & I shared. Gyro meat with the lovely cucumber sauce, 2 falafel (some of the best I've ever had, light, fluffy, melt-in-your mouth), a huge serving of taboli (sp?) salad, 2 warm dolmas (delicious!), an odd little tasty cake (i know it has a name but I'm too lazy to search for it) that had seasoned ground beef sandwich between layers of a slightly sweet wheat cake. Finally, my favorite, the deep fried beef eggroll. The meat was amazingly seasoned but the wrapping was that sweet dough. My sister described it as \"pumpkin pie except with beef.\" Weird combo, but Divine!!!   I'm going back & taking my friends....there are 5 kinds of baklava that we have to try!!!",

    "text": "One of the most ironic things about this place is that it's a stone's throw away from Pita Jungle, yet they're completely different restaurants.  At Haji-Baba the exquisite architecture and the scantily-clad waitresses, don't get factored into your bill. Basically because there aren't any.  It's basically a dive attached to a market.  I love the decor at Pita Jungle but I can't make that justify the food prices.  You can order a appetizer at Haji's that can serve as your meal or just a simple gyro which comes served in tin foil.  The iced tea is great and the baklava comes in more flavors than Baskin Robbins has ice cream.  This place is also a fave of many college students.  One thing I can't understand about Haji's is the service. It's kinda like they don't care. Clearing tables is more important to them than taking care of patrons already at a table. Many times I've gotten up and refilled my own drink.   Prices are low, food is good but check the hours before you go. It doesn't keep standard restaurant hours and I think it takes Sundays off.

    "text": "The first time I sank my teeth into Haji Baba's falafel sandwich, I knew that I had found a winner. Already being a big fan of Phoenecia, I was a little hesitant at first to try Haji Baba, but I had a feeling that I would like it so I gave it a shot. There are three things that you absolutely have to try, and they are:  The falafel sandwich.  The gyro plate.  The dolmas (stuffed grape leaves).  Like most of the reviews read, the falafels are some of the best around! They don't dry out your mouth and are loaded with flavor...not to mention that the sandwich is ultra cheap! As for the gyro plate, I have one thing to say...BEST GYRO MEAT IN PHOENIX! There, I said it. The meat is seriously succulent (you hear that about steak, not gyro meat!), no exaggeration. Just think of the best gyro meat you've ever tasted, but cut thick and served with some of the best tzatziki around. Remember to get the plate when you go and I don't think you will regret it. And lastly, try the dolmas. I say that because they are served here differently than any place in the valley that I've been to, and that is warm. Usually dolmas are served chilled and are brimming with strong sour and oily flavors, not these. Haji Baba's recipe is truly unique; it's mild, not sour and rich with flavor.  Get a small side of lebne to put on em and be prepared for your taste buds to do a little happy dance (not to be confused with the pee pee dance...taste buds don't pee).  There you have it! I finally, after years of going here, reviewed Haji Baba! Now, take it from me and the abundance of other reviewers and go here.",

I love their chicken kabob plate. I always ask for extra tomatoes and cukes on my salad. Also ask for a extra pita with a side of gyro sauce. Try dipping the chicken kabob pieces in the gyro sauce.   Some people don't need \"atmosphere\" to enjoy really good food!! I think Haji would lose it's way if it was a place to see and been seen! Its better to just sit back, relax a little and savor the flavors. Expect about a 15-20 minute wait for that Chicken Kabob to arrive. Its never rushed and I have NEVER had to send anything back.",

    "text": "I went here yesterday for lunch with a friend, my first time ever. First, for those seeking a place with ambiance, Haji-Baba is purely functional. It is located adjacent to a Middle Eastern grocery store and there really is no decor enlivening the dining room. In other words, you come here if you like the food. I was glad to see that they serve kibbeh, which is a Middle Eastern dish I had trouble finding when I last lived in Phoenix, and so I ordered the kibbeh plate. My reaction was a little mixed. First, the plate came with sides of tabouli and hummus, and both were excellent. The hummus was smooth and creamy and nicely spiced and the tabouli was very enjoyable. My mixed feelings concern the kibbeh, which I found to be mediocre. First, I was surprised by its shape and texture. Anywhere else where I have ordered kibbeh, the kibbeh comes in the shape of a dumpling, whereas this was served like two pieces of cake from a square pan. Also, normally the bulgur wheat shell is crunchy, whereas the bulgur wheat here was soft and only lined the top of each piece. I also found the kibbeh to be slightly on the bland side. However, since the two side dishes I had here were quite good, I feel comfortable giving Haji-Baba four stars and would definitely come here again to try a different dish.",

    "text": "When I first moved to Tempe, I was told by my friend who has lived in Tempe all of his life that this was the first place I had to check out and had to get their Gyros. From a grocery store/sit down store? A place called Haji-Baba? On Apache and McClintock? What? Surely you can't blame me for doubting his convictions.   One day we finally went in. I looked at the menu full of foreign foods and was overtaken by fear. \"What is all of this shit?\", I thought to myself. Of course, this was just a sign of how uncultured I was (and still am). Luckily, my friend took the work out of deciphering the menu and ordered a gyro for me. We got it to go.   I opened up my gyro and saw huge chunks of meat. You know those places that have gyros with thin, insulting, child sized strips of meat? Yeah, this isn't one of those places. This is a gyro for a grown man. So, good start, right? I took a bite. It was... amazing. Their feta cheese, onions, and meat combined for one of the best foods I have ever tasted to this day. It was messy, juicy, the meat was packed so thick that it was difficult to eat (all positive notes), and wow, it was just brilliant. You know that feeling you get when you walk into BevMo for the first time and realize you're in alcohol heaven? When you realize you've stumbled upon something special and that you'll be back again and again? Yeah, that's the feeling.  I ate at Haji Baba's again the next day. And about twice every week for a month afterwards. Later I learned that their \"Deluxe\" gyro is even better. I also discovered that they have some kickass foods in there. Special mention goes out to the chocolates..  Unfortunately, I still haven't tried anything else on the menu. This is probably a result of a combination of me being terrified of the menu due to having no idea what those other foods are, and me internally weighing out the risk of eating an average or only above-average food as compared to eating one of my favorite food items in existence. Easy choice.  I've never sat down to eat at Haji-Baba, but when getting the food to go there has never been a problem. The workers are friendly enough for satisfaction without being friendly to the point of irritation or perceived pretentiousness. There's also never a line and it's $3-4 for a Gyro. God damn I love this place.",

This is the real thing set in a Mediterranean market family owned, it's like eating with their family. It doesn't get any better than this. Definitely added to my list of regular go to places.",

I am not knowledgeable in Mediterranean food but I just enjoy eating new and different foods. The yummy smell as we walked in the door told us this was a good pick. Super friendly and quick service from everyone we encountered. We had the chicken shawarma plate and gyro plate. Also falafel and hummus appetizers. Oh my everything was delicious! The serving size is generous! Our server graciously brought us baklava to try and we ended up buying 4 more pieces to take with us. Deliciousness! This is definitely a place to return to often!",

Not really inexpensive either. Nestled next to a middle eastern grocery store, it is a Mecca for people for migrated to the West and miss their native fare.  Please do not get me wrong. If you are one of those who like trying international flavors but are not too concerned about authenticity, you will do fine here. But those of you who are in an eternal quest for real ethnic food are sure to leave with an unfulfilled desire.  My kabab was tough and small in quantity. Plenty of salad and bread, but that's not why I gave this place a shot.  Anyway, worth a try!",

I ordered the chicken shawarma plate and it came with hummus, pita bread,tabouli (but I switched this to a normal salad), and white rice. The portion size is huge at this place and you definitely get your moneys  worth. The food was also outstanding, fresh, and delicious. The flavor combo was out of this world. In addition, the staff was always attentive, kind, and considerate to all their customers. They took orders and served the food in a reasonable amount of time despite being so busy. Seats do fill up quick so I'd recommend you go at a slow time or just wait in line if you don't mind being there longer. This place is absolutely worth the wait.",

    "text": "It's almost eerie how much Haji-Baba reminds me of another valley favorite.  For those of you who've been to Middle Eastern Bakery (or MEB as I often refer to it) on 16th Street in Phoenix, Haji in so many ways feels like MEB's twin.  Or perhaps MEB is Haji Baba's twin?  Anyways, I was looking for a place for dinner close to ASU's Gammage Auditorium in advance of going to see The Book of Mormon (fantastic Broadway show, btw), and came upon Haji as one of my bookmarked spots.  I'd talked to a number of ASU grads who'd raved about this place so around 6pm on a Friday night, I made my way in.  Like I said, the place felt perfectly familiar to me as a faithful MEB customer.  A grocery store and bakery up front with a sit down restaurant to the side.  The aroma of fresh baked goods mixed with the smells of cooked meats and seasonings from the grocery store permeating the air.  The place was unsurprisingly jam packed for dinner, but fortunately the wait for a table was less than 5 minutes.  One significant difference here at Haji versus MEB is that you wait in line for a table and the wait staff takes care of you until you pay at the front counter when you're done (whereas you order everything upfront at the counter at MEB).  The menu has a nice variety of salads, sandwiches and mixed plates consisting of Middle Eastern and Mediterranean influences, including plenty of healthy (and perhaps not so healthy) options to choose from.  I led off with the Hummus Tahini appetizer.  This Hummus was doused with lemon juice, garlic, olives, pickles, sesame seeds, and of course a healthy dose of olive oil.  The pita bread it came with was warm, pillowy soft and perfect for dipping.  I apologize for not getting a photo of this as I was so hungry from skipping lunch earlier in the day that I hoover'd this stuff.  My word this hummus dish was luscious.  I could've eaten a gallon of that hummus it was so good.  I also got an order of their lemonade with rose water.  And for those of you MEB loyalists who think MEB has the best lemonade with rose water out there, you can rest easy.  Haji's version of this drink is delicious and refreshing, but I would still give MEB the slight edge on this particular drink.  Now then for the main entree.  I had to watch my portion size a little bit this go around since I was going to have a theatre play to sit through for 3 hours.  The Sultani plate seemed like just the thing.  A steak kebab, a ground beef kebab, rice, salad, plus pita bread and grilled tomatoes (okay, so it was still a large portion, but I could've gone crazier).  The meats were cooked and seasoned perfectly, and the rice (oh man that rice) had a buttery softness which acted as the perfect compliment.  I restrained myself from ordering dessert this go around, but great dinner all around.  Total cost for the lemonade, food, tax and tip came to $22.  Despite a busy night, I was in and out pretty quickly.  It's not hard to see why this place is so popular with locals and ASU students alike.  Great food, great staff, reasonable prices, in a relaxed casual neighborhood setup.  Being right along the light rail route is also a plus.  It is better than MEB?  Honestly, I'd call it a draw.  Both are awesome spots and I'd gladly go back to either anytime.  Phoenix has MEB & Tempe has Haji, so both cities have a spot to call their own.  Great Middle Eastern cuisine isn't always easy to find, so having two 5 star options in the valley is a big plus.  Next time I'm at Haji, its Baklava time.",

My two favorite things on the menu are the DLX gyro and the chicken shawarma plate. The gyro is packed with feta cheese and the meat has a great seasoned flavor. The shawarma plate comes with hummus, tabooli, rice, and pita. I like to mix mine all together as it creates a nice flavor combination. Other highlights are the hummus plate appetizer and the rose water lemonade. The babaganooj can be good but it is a bit unreliable here and sometimes it tastes very different than usual. Make sure you grab a baklava on your way out!",

I usually get the babbaganoush (delish), which is my fav around town, and the domas, which are handmade here and far superior than other local chain restaurants that use canned or jarred. Yuk!

They are great for vegan options. I ordered the falafel and the hummus. The server was really helpful when I asked to make sure there was no dairy or yogurt in what I ordered. The hummus plate and pita were really tasty and came with tahini mixed in. The falafel came over a lettuce salad and had tahini dressing over it.

The rose water lemonade gives a hint of aromatic rose while delivering the classic lemonade flavor. The platters comfortably feed a budget conscious couple. The spanakopita was a huge hit with my friends and wife, so much so I didn't even get a nibble! Not that I could fit it. The falafil and gyros are both generous in filling and pita.

However, my last experience at this restaurant didn't go well. I wasn't going to post a review about it until that particular incident happen.   I called them at 12:48 for 10 chicken shawarma plates to go. We had a quick conversation and I was told it be ready in ten minutes. I said I'll be there in 15-20 and I was there as I promised. However, I found out that the guy who responded didn't add a zero next to 1 so they made it ready only one. I was totally cool with it cuz, we are human beings and mistaken are so normal. Despite I was in a little bit of rush I was ok with the whole situation. Then the gentlemen told me it will be ready in 2-3 minutes. I said you are fine I'll wait. So after 25 minutes- yes 25 minutes (a duration of numerous customers who are at tables in their restaurant, people who came to buy quick snack or grocery shoppers were served) - 7 of my 10 order was ready to go. They asked me if I'd like to pay after and I said yeah I will... I came to register I'm totally fine despite 45 min passed since my call for the order, and as I was paying the guy literally took some candies (I guess they were turkish delight or some other stuff and start stocking into bags as he was apologizing for the delay. I stopped him there ask not to do and as soon as the other 3 came, I left.   Now,  1) you don't satisfy your frustrated customers with randomly stocked candies  2) If you are sincere about your apology, you go with better solutions than candy( by the way, they candy is always unwrapped I am 100 sure they are all covered with the dust of all the customers walking in-how can you even sell that in the first place is another point 3) If I'd make a big fuss right there instead of writing a review here, probably I'd be the blamed one for making a big drama. Since I was pretty patient with the whole process, you gotta reward that kind customer attitude not with candy.   I am aware I kept forever but last thing, maybe people are enjoying here because they don't find many alternatives to this kind of cuisine and menu but I tell you that, if they would cook, serve the same way back in the hometown of where they are from, They would be one of those average restaurants. So, please whenever you are there; ask for cleanliness and better service and improvement inside the restaurant. Otherwise, if they are not challenged, they will continue to serve average level because of their preferable price/overall ratio.",

    "text": "This place is EASILY one of my favorite spots in Arizona.    First off, it's Middle Eastern food.  Second, the prices are very very reasonable.  Third, no matter how long it's been since my last visit, they always remember me.   I have had a lot of items on the menu, but I typically gravitate towards the Greek salad (lettuce, tomatoes, kalamata olives, cucumber, fat chunks of sheep milk feta, and their AMAZING dressing) $5.99 for a large salad that includes some pita.  I also really enjoy their vegetarian plate, which comes with: falafel, tzatziki, pita, tabooli, stuffed grape leaves and baba ganoush (but I sub for hummus). $7.99 for two meals worth of food!!  Any and all dining cohorts have equally enjoyed their food selections, and usually go back for more:) In addition to all the veg options, they also have chicken/lamb/beef stuffs and they even have a tongue sandwich! (Ew to me, yum to people I know).  I really dig their beverage options: pomegranate juice, sodas, iced tea with a familiar flavor that I can't quite figure out, yogurt soda, lemonade flavored with rose water (my favorite!).    In addition to having delicious food, great service and low prices, they also have a grocery store on the opposite side of the restaurant.  It's great!  Lots of great ingredients that are hard to find in a regular grocery store.  They even have all the fixings for your hookah enthusiasts.    The walls are adorned with \"Best of Phoenix\" awards dating back to the 80's, and it's no wonder.    I give them two BIG thumbs up!",

    "text": "One of my favorite food destinations in town! This is my go to destination for Middle Eastern food. Great quality, nice variety, excellent prices.  I went to Haji Baba recently and wondered what I had written in my review of the place. I looked on Yelp and realized that, despite the many times I've visited over the last couple of years, I've never actually written a review. So now I'm fixing that little oversight.  I first came to Haji Baba while living out-of-state on the recommendation from a friend who made sure to come here at least once or twice very time he was in town. And I was immediately impressed by the place. I've since tried nearly everything on the menu, and I'll keep coming back on a regular basis.  Appetizers: The hummus is a fantastic texture and is a great addition to any dish, really. The tabbouli is the best I've had; it's not too oily and has just mild enough of a flavor to not be overpowering. The baba gannoush is nearly as good as the hummus. I know I've had several other appetizers, and they're all great.  Main dishes: I think I've worked through just about everything on the menu, although I wondered the last time I went if I have tried the Lamb Tongue sandwich. There's enough doubt in my mind that I'll try it next time I go. As far as the sandwiches go, my favorite is the chicken shawarma. It's a nice, thick sandwich for not much money, and the ingredients are all excellent. Tender and juicy chicken, lettuce, pickles, sauce. Excellent! The gyros, beef shawarma, chicken and beef kebabs, and other sandwiches are all tasty as well. As for the plate meals, I'd recommend the kebab combination plate first. It has a heaping of chicken and beef kebabs, and it comes out nice and hot with some sides. All delicious!  I've seen several recommendations of the baklava on here, and I wonder if I had a bad batch or something. The one time I tried baklava--which I generally love--it was dry and not very flavorful. I even tried a couple of varieties. Maybe it's time to try it again...  I like the small grocery store here as well. There are a bunch of lovely spices and hard-to-find imported items, and the prices are pretty reasonable.  Love it.",

My daughter had the kabob koubideh sandwich, which I just happened to take a bite or three of when she was done.  Nice and savory and perfectly cooked.  My sister had the chicken schwarma, of which I had a bite and the chicken was tender and flavorful.  I had the combination combination plate.  The gyro meat was very savory and my favorite part of the meal.  The grape leaves, with the warm orange rice, were the best I've ever had.  The falafel were average.  Too much crunch and not enough flavor.  The tabooli was the perfect complement to the savory meat.  I'm not a huge kibbeh fan, but it was decent.  The sambousek was delicious.    Good service.  Next time I go, I want a tour of the grocery store.",

    "text": "If you've ever gyros hopped before, you know that not all gyros are created equal, and until today; if asked, I would have told you my favorite gyros is at Cypress Grill. I am happy to report, opinion changed!  I've had this spot bookmarked for quite a while now, the trouble is that I spoiled myself by moving a mile away from where I work; I've got dining, shopping, and work all within 5 minutes. There's 4 froyo shops, 5 gyros spots, 6 grocery stores, countless dining, dive bars, comedy clubs, open mics, music and more. Travelling outside of my acceptable radius is quite the big deal. There's usually some type of planning, engagement, or craving involved that just can't happen inside my bubble.   I recently was in the Tempe area and decided to strike while the iron is hot. If you visit expecting the usual quick serve, show up, eat, and leave setting - you're only partly right, but Haji-Baba is so much more. Haji is a Middle East / Mediterranean market - who also makes one heck of a gyros, and I'm happy to stamp my opinion of \"Personal Favorite - thus far\" on it.   I ordered up a Gyros DLX - sans tomato. This thing comes falling out the pita with a generous portion of gyros, lettuce, onion, tomato, tatziki, feta cheese and all wrapped up with a hand made pita. Best yet, it's under five bucks! - if you're not into the hand made pita or fresh of the block feta cheese, it's younger brother \"Gyros\" comes with the same delicious lamb and beef gyros for about $3.69.  Though, why stop at just the gyros? This place is flushed with great imported foods and fresh made desserts to order up from their market. Shop through aisles of items like spices, sauces, pickled beets, harissa (spicy pepper sauce), cookies, and so much more. Check in their glass case for fresh made pastires, olives, and feta cheese. On a whim I tried out one of their harissas and haven't looked back since. Now I'm blending up my favorite spicy pepper hummus with jalepeno, garlic, and harissa week after week. - message me if you want the recipe; it's awesome, I promise ;-)  Happy Yelping Phoenix - break outside your bubble once in a while and you'll be surprised at what you can find!",

My daughter always gets the chicken kabob plate and leaves no crumbs! Mom enjoys the hot tea with the lamb plate.  Casual atmosphere and prices are good. Highly recommend this place!!! The grocery store is great. Always take some feta cheese, pita's and dates for future meals at home.",

Things that I havent seen since living in NY, like sugar coated chick peas (think Jordan Almonds) and Rose Water which I use to make lemonade and you can order direct off their menu!  So yummy.

Pros - best halvah I ever had at the deli - joyva brand brought in from New York in large wedges.   Falafel was one of the best - moist inside and more a half ball with a flat side than a ball or oval.    Got the shish kabob - it was well charred on one side and that affected the flavor but it was not burned so bad it could not be eaten. There was no flavor like it was never marinated and not even the typical slightly gamy lamb flavor, just bland and on the tough side.  Dressing on salad was regular Italian and plenty put on rather than a Mediterranean dressing.  Also got the combination.  Gyro was fine - typical taste and texture.  Tabooli about 90% parsley which was ok.  Kibbi had no meat (could not see, feel, or taste any).  It was a nice piece of bread but not what was expected.  Dolmas flavor was ok but the grape leaves were very tough taking effort to bite thru and chew.  We have had the same dishes done much better at other restaurants including ones close by this one and would not return here except maybe rarely to get some halvah.",

Whenever we eat at Middle Eastern restaurants such as this, I always gotta test them out with my tried and True favorites, Gyro and Hummus.   And, YES......they were both GOOOOD!! Fantastic even! Excellent flavors on the gyro, and not too greasy either. The pita was fantabulous, so soft and perfect. And the hummus? WINNING. NOW I found the best hummus in Phx, really now, this time I'm certain! ;D So creamy with the perfect about of garlic, oh, it was really divine.  Next time I'll be brave and try the lamb tongue, (no really, when you go, read the menu, Hilarious! You'll see what I mean.......then you'll chuckle to yourself and order it next time hahahaha)   Service was great, super speedy, even despite the mad lunch rush. As far as the actual market goes, they had what typically middle eastern markets have, spices, rosewater, tea, stuff. We did notice that they seemed to have a lot of items from Jordan in particular.     This is for sure my new gyro and hummus spot, and who knows, it might soon become my new lamb tongue spot too! tee hee.....",

It is delicious and at 3.29 the first time I came here I bought two thinking they'd be small. I was completely wrong and ended up pretty much wasting a whole gyro (although it was so good I was wanting to down it no matter how stuffed I was. Anyway maybe I'll expand my horizons on the menu in the future, maybe not but this place earned itself 5 stars in my book and I'll be here often. Oh and there is also a market inside which sells hookah supplies at very good prices so if you are into that its another great reason to come here.",

A good appetizer would be the dormades (rice wrapped in grape leaves), followed by the chicken sherwama plate and a cup of their nice and thick turkish coffee.  The plates comes with a generous serving of taboili, hummus, rice and meat.  For the price, its definitely worth a visit.  Can be crowded during lunch times.",

Haji-Baba's was cheap, and that's good and all, but I think the next time I'm craving middle eastern, I'll find a different place....",

Having worked in a \"Mediterrenean\" restaurant for a couple of years I can cook most of this stuff myself but their hummus and sandwiches are difficult to beat.  Actually, my friend and I try hummus just about everywhere we go (esp in other cities, countries, etc.) and keep agreeing that Hadji's makes the top 5 list every time, number 1 in AZ.  One thing about Hadji's is that you always have to remember to ask for the \"Hand-made Pita\" when ordering your sides and sandwiches, it will make a world of difference.  And when you are done you can always pick up some Baklava or they have a rack of Eastern European chocolates and candies right next to the dining area, YUM!  Simply, it's difficult to find a meal this good for a completely reasonable price.",

    "text": "I managed to beat  the lunchtime crush of people heading to Haji Baba by about ten minutes.  I had already placed my order.  My plate of hummus and my yogurt soda was just arriving when I noticed the place was now packed, and a line of people was waiting for a table.  Two obviously out-of-town ladies sat at the table nearest me.  They used loud, awed, slightly bemused voices that hinted they were from the Midwest and had never been \"out West\" before.  \"... couldn't BELIEVE the TRAFFIC!\" one was saying as they sat down.  \"We waited fifteen minutes on the street before we could even turn into the campus!\"  ASU was having their Student Load-In week; traffic was hellish anywhere near the university. \"It was no better when we unloaded Nicole's things,\" the other woman said.  \"We were right in the middle of carrying in everything, and a security guard stopped us an told us we couldn't --\" \"Would you like something to drink?\" the waiter asked, surprising them both. They gave him their orders, after asking \"what kind of pop\" they had.  Definitely Midwestern.  The waiter walked away, and they continued staring at the menus as they assumed looks of deep confusion. \"What is ... shum ... shoe-marmy?\" \"Shoe-arma?  Shuh, warma?\" \"What IS that?\" \"I have no idea.  But it comes in a sandwich.\" \"Like, on bread?\" \"It says on a pita.\" \"Oh .... But isn't a pita a cracker?\" \"What about ... baba gub .... Bana gaboosh?\" \"Where?\"  The friend pointed at the other's menu.  \"Oh my.  Bagga boo ... goosh?  Excuse me?  Sir?\"  I realized she was talking to me.  \"Do you know what this is?\"  She pointed at her menu. \"Baba gannouj,\" I said.  I kind of enjoyed the look of fear that crossed their faces, as though I were uttering a phrase that would summon a lesser demon.  \"It's eggplant dip, kind of lemony.  Kind of like hummus.  You dip pita into it.  It's great.\"  As I spoke, I watched her eyes grow huge as she saw my glass of fizzy, thick white yogurt soda. \"I've never even HEARD of that!\" the other woman said.  \"What's this fluffoofal?\"   \"Felafel,\" I said, and the fact that I avoided laughing then should earn me some kind of award.  \"They're fantastic here, lots of great spices ... have you had felafal before?\"   They hadn't, of course, and I was at a loss to explain it.  I decided the shwarma or the gyros were probably too \"exotic,\" so I recommended the chicken kebab pitas.  My koobideh plate arrived then, prompting another couple of baffled, wide-eyed stares.  I told them to be sure and get a couple pieces of baklava for dessert, since it's better, fresher, and half the price of anywhere else nearby.  They agreed, but I got the impression it was more due to the fact that they had heard of baklava before than my recommendation.  Judging by the yummy noises coming from their table as they ate, they enjoyed their kebabs.  I had to withhold a star, as much as I love Haji Baba, because it does not have the best shwarma I've found.  It's very, very good ... but not the best.",

We have gotten the chicken shwarma, hummus, mixed paltter, gyros, olives, baklava, falafal, etc, etc. The thing that is a drawback for me is, well a couple: It is a restaurant on one side and grocery market on the otehr stide. The market is often cluttered and I am not overwhelmed by cleanliness. The other thing that really bothered me was the large jars of olives for people to serve themselves. I saw a guy reach into each of them with his hands and taste one from each jar. When I said something to him, he told me it was fine and basically blew me off. I thought it was disgusting and so I do NOT eat the olives! I have since taught myself to make a lot of my favorite dishes, but still love the bread. As far as handicap accessibility, I would have to look again, I know you must step up from the parking onto the sidewalk curb.  Update, I went there a couple weeks ago and everything was hot or cold as it should be and delicious!!!!! Yum, I am ready to go back!!!",

You sip the lemonade and inhale through your nose and you smell roses.  It is freaking amazing.  In college, we used to get the arabic coffee to keep us awake for our late night studies.

I liked the flavor of my baba ganouj better after I took it home and ate it the next day. I think the flavors were better blended with time.  Meal portions are generous - good for sharing and/or taking home lots of leftovers.   I have finally found a place in the Phoenix area that has fresh baklava! They make it in-house and in many varieties - almond, pecan, walnut, pistachio, combination... Exquisite as it is so fresh.  Haji-Baba is a small strip-mall restaurant combined with a store (last time I was at the store, I purchased spices, pickled turnips colored with beet juice, rose water, orange water, baklava and other pastries.   If this place were on my side of town, I'd be there several times a month. As it is, I am grateful they are in the Phoenix area. I will be back.",

The Veggie Platter came with baba ghanouj, tabouleh, a yogurt dip, two pieces of falafel and two pieces of dolma along with some pita bread. Everything tasted fresh and great. The Turkish coffee had a tinge of cardamom in it which I really liked. For dessert, we got a walnut baklava and a pistachio baklava. It is probably the best baklava that I have eaten so far in my life. Plenty of vegetarian options in the menu. I'll be coming back to Haji-Baba just for the hummus and the baklava.",

The food was epic - large portions, clearly extremely fresh and cooked with care and attention to detail.  The pita is cooked freshly on site (and it shows).  The Baba Ganoush was great.  Also be sure to check out the shop - it's full of Yugoslavian foods (and the only place we found that sells Halloumi in Phoenix).",

They actually have their own falafel mix frozen to buy and cook at home! And in the market I can find everything I need to prepare a meal and then some. The guys who work there are very helpful and nice. I will definitely continue to patronize this amazing little place!",

    "text": "Is it a market with a dining area or a restaurant with a market?  Does it really matter?  It is just plain good!!  If you are looking for a no frills spot, Haji Baba is for you!  The small dining area is on the right side of the market, with a few tables even spilling out into the market itself.  It gets very busy during lunchtime, so arrive early or be prepared for a wait.    While the menu offers a variety of choices, being a creature of habit, I typically stick with what I know and love - the gyro sandwich.  Nice and simple - a hearty portion of gyro meat, cool lettuce, pickle, tomato and creamy tatziki enveloped in a large, soft pita.  All this goodness for $3.99.  Yes, really $3.99.  I can never finish it, even though I really, really try.  I also like their hummus (served with warm soft pita it is a great appetizer to share) as well as the spanakopita.  Actually, I have enjoyed everything I have tried.  So, you really can't go wrong.  The payment process is interesting - the waiter drops off a ticket stub at the table that you bring to the market register to pay.  If you are with a group, each person can pay separately by telling the cashier their items on the total ticket, which is nice.  And, if you happen to grab some of the tasty chocolate wafer cookies by the register to add to your bill, that is not a bad thing.  Be sure to ask for some delicious baklava to go!",

It is the basis for all my comparisons and I've never been as satisfied as when I get it here. It is uniformly amazing. Their grape leaves are also delicious and made with what must be fresh ones, not canned, as they have such a better texture than any others I've had. I have had better falafel elsewhere, but that's not what I come here for so I can't dock them any stars. And staff has become SO much friendlier than when I first started coming here (about 10 years ago). The grocery store also has a huge selection of the real deal. I'm so glad I made a point of coming by on my way to the airport. I'd have never forgiven myself if I missed out!",

    "text": "Anyone that knows me knows I only review places I love. I'm no negative Nancy and I refuse to bring down small businesses for simple mistakes. On that note this will be my first and hopefully only bad review I ever have to give.   Before I get into the bad stuff, I have to say that the only reason I gave this place any stars at all is because of the food. If I was reviewing just the food it would be 4 stars. Its the best middle eastern food I've had here so far and I MIGHT return just because it was so good but I'll definitely be taking it to go and will only cave when I really want some chicken Kabob.   Ok now onto the bad stuff. We were greeted by a waiter that seemed nice enough and he sat us down in the store section. As we waited quite a while to be attended we decided we would get the food to go and maybe just eat a bit at our table ( we were starving) and then finish it at home. So we politely told the waiter we would just order the food at the counter and he nicely agreed it wouldn't be a problem. Once we got our food we opened up our togo boxes and started eating quickly so that we could leave asap. Suddenly another waiter (some Asian guy, seemed like the only Asian worker there) decided to rudefully scold us in front of the other customers for staying to eat there when we had ordered our food to go. I manage a restaurant and I always make sure I don't make the workers life more difficult than need be it so I couldn't understand what he was bothered about. There were no customers waiting for tables (plenty of open tables), they weren't closing yet and we were sitting at the table the original waiter had sat us at to begin with. I honestly saw no reason for the rude scolding we had just received. Due to his terrible attitude we decided to finish our plates there and take our time (yeah I decided to be a B**** after being yelled at by a stranger, sue me) and then he still decided to come back and angrily tell us how they usually close that section earlier to which I replied \"ok\". I didn't want to argue with him but if we had decided to eat there that would have been the table we were GIVEN. So his bad attitude was a load of s**t. After that he kept coming back to that section and mumbling stuff under his breath and staring at us. He was a jerk and should be fired. Like I said, I manage a restaurant so I know what its like to have a bad day and sometimes accidentally let it out on someone. If he had been rude and then apologized for his bad attitude (as I have to customers) I wouldn't even be writing this. But that guy was an as*hole and doesn't deserve to work a job where he has to deal with people. Keep him in the back washing dishes or something. If I were them, I'd consider getting rid of him and hiring someone with some people skills.",

    "text": "Ever wonder why small specialty shops that have a deli and/or restaurant have the best food?  I figure it's because they use off the shelf ingredients that they sell. And HAJI BABA is a perfect example. Their food is not gourmet. It's not a fad-diet phenom. It's not even even hip. What it is...is the look and taste of carefully prepared traditional food that these folks would eat at home. Their food brings back memories from when I was a kid.  The difference? I now appreciate the savory flavors and blends of herbs and spices that goes into making their food. During every visit, my wife buys treats with Nutella, also something I grew up with in Europe. My kids have to get their own flavor of Chiklets gum-remember those? We never leave without a plate of baklava to go.  My favorite dish is the gyro plate. It's under $10 and always has been. The plate is heaped with tender meat, fresh tossed salad with dressing and light and fluffy rice. Its like sitting inside your dream car with your hand on the steering wheel - revving the motor. It's the absolute best. Try it. You won't leave hungry or empty handed.",

If anything you order comes with pita (including hummus), ask for the pitas to be handmade. It is a few cents extra, but WELL worth it. The chicken shawarma salad is fresh and tasty, if you like olive oil and dill. Make sure to order a side of falafel, it is spiced to perfection. I never order soft drinks at restaurants, but the lemonade here is excellent. It has some type of flower essence... jasmine? and is very unique. Not a place to go if you're trying to impress a date, but perfect for every day eating. How can food this good be so inexpensive?",

    "text": "My uncle, 2 cousins, my partner, her 2 boys and myself all decided to try this place out a couple weeks ago for dinner. Most of us are very familiar with Middle Eastern food so we had a pretty good idea of what to get and how things should taste.   First, it's a small place, with tables sort of thrown into an add-on to a Mid-Eastern market, so larger parties may have an issue getting seated right away. It took them almost 20 minutes to seat us, but that's not entirely their fault. I mean, you have to work with what you've got, right? Just be prepared to wait if there's more than, say, 5 or so in your group.  The market is kind of nifty, so take the time to browse if you get there and are waiting for a table or for people to show up. Lots of spices, and you can ogle the half dozen different types of baklava they have up front. Yes, I said half a dozen. Pistachio, walnut, pecan, almond, and a couple others. They also have Bulgarian feta, which I haven't had since I left Bangkok, and I highly recommend if you're a fan of Greek feta. I'll be going back for a nice big chunk, this I can promise you.   Now the food: My partner's two boys are two of the pickiest eaters I know, so we got them the chicken kebab sandwich. I didn't get to try it, but they both finished their plates, so I'll take that as a positive testimonial. My partner and I shared a variety of things: gyros, kebab, chicken shwarema, rice, hummus (which on the menu is spelled \"homos,\" much to the amusement of the kids), and tabouli, with homemade pita bread. My cousins both got the veggie platters and I honestly don't remember what my uncle got. :) The gyros and kebab were phenomenal, extremely flavourful, and the gyros was the best I'd had in a long time. I think the chicken shwarama was my favourite though. It almost melts in your mouth and the flavours are fantastic. The hummus was very good, especially with the homemade pita. (Definitely pay the extra for the \"real\" stuff. Store bought just doesn't cut it here.) I'm not really a huge fan of tabouli, but my partner seemed to like it well enough. One great little surprise for me were the dolmas (stuffed grape leaves). A traditional Greek dish, I'm never really a fan. My dad makes these by the bucketful and freezes them. Usually, for me, they tend to be bitter and too bland, but I got to try one off of one of the veggie plates and it was actually REALLY good. I honestly think it may have been the best dolmades I've ever had. So I'd recommend it.   To drink I took a risk and got the yogurt soda. Anyone familiar with Indian food will most likely have tried lassi at one point of another.... this is NOT lassi. This is definitely an acquired taste, but if you want to try something different, give it a shot. It is literally plain, unsweetened yogurt with soda water. No one else at my table liked it, but I thought it was different and in its own way, rather refreshing.   We shared the pistachio and pecan baklava at the end of the meal. Fresh, homemade and soooooo good!   I have lots of reasons to go back, one of which would be the bill at the end of the night. Keep in mind, there were 4 of us on our tab, 2 kebab sandwiches, 3 drinks, my yogurt soda, the chicken shwarama plate, a kebab, a gyros and 2 baklava and it all came up to about $35. You really can't beat that.",

My husband and I went and we got the two most popular things on their menu plus an iced tea.  The flavors were very nice but I didnt like the use of dark chicken meat.  To me it just doesnt taste as good and there was no choice it just comes that way.  Other things were really dry and not as good as what I am used to when I go out to eat.  The iced tea was nice it was a black tea with cinnamon added so not that special but I guess it is different than the norm which I like.  To me Pita Jungle and My Big Fat Greek are far superior but of course it would depend on what you ordered.  I like spicy and I love tahini.  This place was kinda below average for me and I think its because of the dark meat chicken.  My husband left his whole plate untouched pretty much.  He had a sampler with grape leaves, meat balls, rice, etc.  it wasnt that good but we brought it home and I warmed it up the next day and it was much better for some reason.",

And by slow, I mean that I suspect that the kitchen was still plucking the feathers off the chicken when I ordered by kebabs. Our server had suggested that the schwarma would take at least 30 minutes to prepare and in retrospect, I should have ordered it anyway based on the length of time it took for our order to arrive. And it was NOT busy.  Drinks again were left bone dry. I tried the yogurt soda which was DISGUSTING. Skip it. The food was just meh and the service was yet again, lackluster at best.   I will not be back to Haji Baba. 2 chances and between the meh food and the lackluster service, I just can't see giving more of my time or effort to a place that doesn't seem to want to put in time or effort.",

This was the first place I ever met fellow Yelpers in Phoenix, as it was the venue for an UYE (Unofficial Yelp Event) and I was brand new to the valley.  It did not disappoint... the food is amazing, for both the price and the quality.  And, of course, I was thrilled to discover how nice all of the new people I met from Phoenix were.  I've continued the tradition of introducting people from out of town to one of Phoenix's (Tempe... you know) brightest gems.  Even a friend from Napa, who knows fine wine and fine dining, was blown away by the food here.  I had the chicken schwarma platter which, in my opinion, is the best sampler of what they offer here: delicate Basmati rice, creamy creamy hummus, spicy chunky chicken and tabouleh (I believe that's what they call the greenish side salad-ish stuff). My dining companions ordered the gyro platter and were happy as can be.  Another treat here, besides the incredible food, is the grocery store.  I was on a mission to find a spicy Tunisian pepper condiment, harissa, for eventual use in homemade merguez sausages. I found it and have it tucked away for the next time I dare to make my own sausage.  Haji Baba has become my one-stop shop for all things Middle Eastern and delicious.",

We both got the chicken shwarma plate with the garlic sauce...the plate was large, but the food on it was not very good. The chicken was some of the worst quality I have had in a long time....having cartilage and other chewy grossness.... The garlic 'sauce' was more like mayo...really gelatinous. The rice was just plain white rice, the hummus was ok....pretty generic, the tabbouleh was almost all parsley, barely any grains or tomato.....it just was not so pleasant.

The other room is dining area seating, but certainly not high class.  I am not giving points on decor or atmosphere.  The food, service and prices makes up for it.  I've only tried a couple of dishes, but each one has been so full of flavor and so rich that I quickly realize I only need half a portion to be more than satisfied.  This is also because of the huge serving sizes!  All of this for nearly half of what I'd expect to pay at a larger, or chain restaurant.  Come with an appetite and an open mind.

    "text": "So glad I found this place on Yelp when trying to look around Phoenix, Arizona for someplace to eat. It truly deserves the rating it has because this place will leave you with a full, happy stomach, a content mind, and a smile on your face when you leave.   My boyfriend and I never truly tried Middle Eastern food, but we both were glad we checked this place out and that it served as our first taste ever of Middle Eastern food.   Upon walking into the restaurant, I was a little confused because it was half shopping market and half restaurant. But I felt reassured when I noticed that it was full of people conversing, eating, and looking so glorious with their plates of food! Not only that, but it was a diverse set of people which shows that their food is so great that it breaks cultural/ethnic boundaries.   We were seated in such a down-to-earth fashion that it immediately made us feel so comfortable talking to our host and waiter. Service here is wonderful because not only does the waiter joke with you and is easy to talk to, but they are also efficient when it comes to bringing out your food and checking up on you--they do it so naturally, too.   I decided on ordering the CHICKEN SCHWARMA PLATE (grilled marinated chicken with garlic sauce, rice, flatbread, hummus, and a cilantro salad?) that everyone else recommended. Glad my first Middle Eastern plate was this one because I finished like 95% of it (hey, it was a humongous pile of scrumptious food). The grilled marinated chicken tasted absolutely amazing when you mix it up with the garlic sauce and the rice and add a bit of hummus with each bite. Perfect mixture for the win!!! I made sure to eat the mixture with the flat bread first and when that was over, I killed the rest of it. To make sure my palette wasn't too overwhelmed with the meaty, creamy flavors, they had a cilantro salad that was refreshingly acidic to refresh your taste buds. What I also loved about this plate was the hummus; the hummus was well seasoned where you can eat a lot of it (since it wasn't too salty like store brand hummus usually are)--it had a slight taste to it which complemented pretty much everything on that plate.  Would love to come back here whenever I'm back in Phoenix. Would highly recommend it to those living in the area (you guys are so lucky!). You can tell upon stepping into the door, that you're stepping into a place of authenticity where they don't need the best decor to get you satisfied, all they need is their food and their personalities to keep you coming back for more.",

They've been here for about 30+ years I believe since 1981 !! That's awesome !! I remember this place when I was a kid.  My grandfather lives 2 minutes from here, so anytime I visit & I'm in the mood for some bomb ass food this is where I come.    It's 1/2 cafe & 1/2 market.  You immediately smell deliciousness when you walk in!  all the staff are friendly and more than willing to help out with suggestions on the dishes!!   You can totally tell that all the ingredients are of high quality & very fresh !! The hummus is amazing with the perfect texture and balance of acidity ( not to much lemon ) they sure do give you plenty. It comes with a pickle on top and one olive.   Sandwiches range from $3.49-$5.99   Plates come with Basmati rice & salad, they range from $7.99-9.99  The only thing that could be better about this place is the napkins & plastic ware.  The napkins are the so flimsy it rips so easily even with gentle use.  But its all good !! just use double the napkins and you'll be ok.    Scale of 1-10 this place is a solid 9   ENJOY FELLOW YELPERS",

I did not like the green side (I think it's tabouleh?) that consisted of parsley and other things, a salad of sorts.  But I usually don't like that stuff at any restaurant.  The hummus was good and they bring you plenty of bread/pita.  While you are there, check out the little grocery market attached.  They sell some items for really cheap, such as spices and dates.  They also have goodies from other countries, such as chocolates from London and Germany.",

So I found a similar size at Haji-Baba and it's half the price of my former brand, only $2.50. I can live with that.   Also, I finally tried Turkish delight, which they stock by the front counter. When I paid my restaurant bill, I'd always sneak a glance at it. They raised the price to $7.50 a box but it's still okay. Turkish delight is gooey and reminiscent of jujubees.

I'm not a fan of their hummus, AT ALL. In fact I think it's bland and tasteless. Their garlic sauce is made with mayo which isn't my favorite. I personally think it's tastier when it's just mashed garlic. The chicken shawarma just didn't do it for me, however I have enjoyed the kafta plate on more than one occasion.

Not when these flavors await.      We got a mixed platter that gave us a little of everything, and it was all quite good.The two of us took quite a bit of leftovers home.  I've always had a good meal each time I've gone here and if they had better hours I would go more often.   Tempe is Phoenix's hub for Middle Eastern fare, and Haji-Baba is one of the best.",

I either go for the gyro wraps or full plates if I'm truly hungry.  The wall art is an interesting mix of Roman and Egyptian architecture. The table seatings is a no frill setting. Service is minimal. But great value for the price.   The restaurant is shared with a Arab mini-market. Plenty of parking and only about 200 feet east of the light rail stop. It's located on the same shopping strip as  Khai Hoan Vietnamese restaurant so coming here creates a choice dilemma for me.",

Chicken plates there are to die for. Third, the SERVICE is good. Generally, places that serve cheap food aren't exactly obligated to have the best service...but this restaurant goes above and beyond that call. I have been there enough times for the workers to recognize me, and know what I want. Preparation of the food seems to always be quick as well. All-around great for college students on a budget as well as a hearty family meal.  Also, the market side seems to sell many cheap, varied food and kitchen items. I don't normally venture on that side of the store, but I do hear it's worth it.",

The Chicken Shawarma special comes with their hand-made pita - so soft and delicious. The chicken is seasoned perfectly and comes with a yummy little dollop of garlic sauce. I've never found better hummus in my life. I've had it all around town, in New York, in L.A. (ick...L.A. *shudder*). SO good! The iced tea has a hint of rose water. OH and the gyro? Hands down, the best in town.  Did I mention they have a market attached? Talk about the best price on spices in town! The spices come in little plastic sealed pillows, so get some spice jars from Ikea and stock up!  I couldn't get through this without mentioning the lamb tongue. I am no connoisseur of organ meats, but this sandwich is like the most tender lamb you've ever had in your life. Shut up and try it.  The only sad part about Haji's is that they close early. Usually 8pm on a week-night, but totally worth getting to-go orders if you can swing in on your way home from work!",

No worries...)  It was EVERYTHING I read about...the food was incredibly inexpensive and pretty good! I tried the Gyro Deluxe, which is a gyro with onions, feta, dressing, lettuce, & tomato on a pita for about $4.25...really good (except for the PITA was stale and started to fall apart, like it was old!)  Of course, they served us MORE stale pita with the bland hummus...a little disappointing.  It is 1/2 market and 1/2 sit down restaurant. They have a counter for take-out orders. It's not fancy by any means, but good food in a clean place at a great price is what you can expect here.  The water is nasty Phoenix Tap (not the filtered version), but they sell bottles of Arrowhead water in the sports top for .99 cents in the market part of the place....good price!  There is only one restroom, usually it's occupied.  I always see the same two waiters...one older skinny middle eastern guy and the other younger dude reminds me of Adam Sandler's Don't Mess with the Zohan...hee hee!

Why does it have way better hummus, chicken schwarma, gyros and babaganoush than anywhere I can find in Tucson?  Why do they have better home-made feta cheese than anywhere in Tucson?  Why, Haji-Baba?  Why?  I want answers!  I really love hole-in-the-wall places.  This place is no exception.  Their hummus was described to me as \"creamy\" and I made a vomit noise.  But it is totally creamy.  But not with dairy, it's like they put it through a mill or something, because a food processor could never in a million years make it that smooth.  The babaganoush was tangy and flavorful, served with freaking amazing pita bread that was warm.  The chicken schwarma was...I don't know that words can describe it.  Basically anything I say will make is sound not as good as it was.  Divine doesn't cut it.  Juicy, perfectly cooked, exploding with flavor...I mean...they work for now.  I will make up a word soon that adequately describes it.  The gyro was spectacular.  The meat was seasoned to tender perfection, and they put home made feta cheese on it!  The feta cheese is not nearly as salty as any other kind I have ever had, and it was way creamier.  We had rose-water lemonade, which I have indeed found in Tucson.  At the street fair.  You know, the one that happens twice a year?  I am pretty happy to find a place that has it year-round!",

It was the perfect blend of moisture and flavor (I hate it when it's so dry that it just crumbles).  And the side of feta that we ordered was the size of a bread plate.  Heaven!  Maybe I shouldn't have ordered that side of pickles, which was also the size of a bread plate :) But they were so good!  We ordered a side of pita bread, too, which came out to our table warm... and then it kept on coming.    I had the vegetarian combination plate for dinner.  I was shocked when I saw the huge portion size... I felt like my eyes might have been bigger than my stomach.  The combo plate came with a small salad, 2 falafel with tahini sauce, tabouleh, 2 dolmas, a huge portion of baba, a side of tzaziki, and pita.  Yeah, WOW!  I fell in love with this food at first bite!  These people really don't want you to leave hungry, that's for sure!  I noticed that they also had so many shisha flavors, so I purchased a huge box of watermelon for $10.92.  I love these prices!!!",

Service is kind of slow.  That's just how it is.  My wife ordered baba ganouj and the chicken shawerma platter.  Very good baba ganouj, smokey, mellow, creamy.  Chicken shawerma is very good, tasty, tender, moist, with garlic sauce on the side.  Tabooli is good, although I'm not a fan.  Rice is quite good, as is the hommos (their spelling).    I had the Foul (fava beans), which were quite good, and the Kabab Mixed, which included a chicken kabab, beef koubideh, and shish kabab, hommos, tabouli, but no rice. The chicken was the best of the bunch, good char, tender, moist  The shish kabab was overdone in my opinion, but still tender.  The koubideh, I could pass on.  The pita comes hot, and slightly crispy.  Wonderful!  Grabbed a chicken shawerma and hommos to go, on our way out of town.",

Uhh its so good I could bottle it and drink it. Every once in a while I will venture out and try something different, and it has all been amazeballs. Although some may argue that all of its charm is the hole in the wall ambiance, I would beg to differ. This place is swamped at all hours of the day, I know they have enough money to do a small remodel. I mean I don't think the building interior has been touched or updated since dinosaurs roamed the earth. Nevertheless, I don't want to take away from the deliciousness and the joy that their food brings me, but it would make me so happy to see the day that their restaurant dining experience to reflect wonderful their food truly is.",

I'm not saying your gyro will be dry unless you have extra, but this is how I love it.    I hear the shwarma is also very good. INSIDE SKINNY: Fresh dates come in November!! $5-something per pound.

It is worth making the drive from Tucson on its own.  But that is not all thats fantastic about this place. The gyros here are incredible. I prefer mine deluxe which includes their home-made feta cheese, which is also just incredible. Its not as salty as most feta cheeses are, and its a bit more creamy as well. So in other words, its better than most feta cheeses by miles.  The chicken schwarma is also one of my favorites. When I bring someone, I encourage that we each order one or the other and then split them so we each get half of two amazing pita sandwiches. Other favorites of mine include the baba ganouch, the chicken salad, the fallafel, and the rose water lemonade. Ahh, soooo refreshing.  The sandwiches especially are extremely inexpensive and worth every penny, but everything is pretty well priced. The market inside is a great place to buy spices on the cheap and one of the best places to get things like adjvar and middle eastern breads. Fresh made baklava is also a \"dont-miss-it\" item.   Honestly, I've been coming here since I was a little kid and there are not enough good things I can say about this place. Everyone in-the-know knows about this place. So be an upstanding, knowledgeable, productive member of society and find yourself here.",

You can walk in this restaurant with 15 bucks and fully feed two adults no problem. The portions are big and they really give you what you pay for. The dishes usually have rice or hummus or salad, and they are all pretty tasty.   The falafels are good, not the greatest on earth, but very good. The hummus too, it's tasty and authentic and has a nice rich flavor. The side salad is surprisingly tasty for being cheap lettuce, it has this tasty sauce that has tahini in it, I personally add a little lemon to it for more taste.  The entrees are good, the meat is tasty, and the sides are heaping. You get a good sized meal for 7-8 bucks.  My only issue are the pitas, they are the same old cheap white flour pitas you can find in the grocery store. Nothing special or tasty, just typical plain old pitas. I really wish they would offer whole wheat pitas, especially for the people with allergies to white flour and simple sugars. It's rare to see whole wheat in any mediterranean place.  My favorite dish here is the one that freaks most people out...THE LAMB'S TONGUE! It sounds weird, but it is absolutely delicious people, you have to try it. Seriously, get over your little phobias and try the lamb tongue pita. It tastes just like the best pastrami or corned beef in mediterranean flavors, it's the best thing on the menu. Try it!",

    "text": "Now on my third time eating here since I found it a few weeks back and everything is amazing. I a big fan of homemade middle eastern food an have been spoiled with it because family and friends would make it (my grandpa made hummus, tabouli and falafel). this place does it right. I have tried the gyro, kifta, hummus, tabouli and more and it has all been great.   My True judge of a mid-eastern place is the hummus since I love it and have been making my own for as long as I can remember. This stuff is great right combo of flavors and good bread to boot. My only knock is it's a but creamier than I like and a bit less garlic(but I love super extra garlic so I can't hold that against them). Overall it's just right and I will devour it.   The meats are all flavorful and moist (especially rare with most other gyros). The tabouli is a nice mix of greens and wheat with a ton of fresh flavors.  Plain in simple if you like mid-eastern food go here you won't regret it. Try the combination meal and get a bit of all the good stuff.",

The shawarma is divine (best I've had in Arizona, and a close runner-up for all time) and the gyros are outstanding.  In fact, I've never had anything bad here.  I'm not even a huge tabbouleh fan, and I still wolf down Haji-Baba's.  On top of that, everything is pretty cheap and you get huge portions.  I can always get at least two meals out of one of their platters.  The place itself is a little unassuming storefront.  It's almost a diner feeling in the restaurant area.  It also has a pretty awesome little grocery where you can pick up a little bit of everything from fresh feta, hookah supplies and (my favorite) Kinder chocolates.  It can get a bit hectic at peak meal times (you pay up at the front in the grocery), but always worth it.  We've only had bad service once and even then, they were very good about making it up to us and gave us a free bakalava and mint tea for dessert.  Definitely give this place a try, even if you're not a fan of Middle Eastern food. It'll change your mind!",

I am thinking to myself, ahhh.... this gotta be authentic mom & pop's shop.  Given the review, i though everything must be pretty good, let me have the combination platter so that I have a taste of everything ... Service was quick, but honestly the food was not the best I have had ... no better than any other greek restaurant. Meat was not tendered enough and the friend stuffs are fried too long and making it dry ... for the price, it's not bad but nothing to wow about ...",

I didn't go but my mom craved this place during our trip and went back a second time-this time with me.  So basically it's a store with a small kind-of restaurant inside. Serves middle eastern food, I am leaning towards more greek because of grape leaves and the gyros..  Anyhoo, I had a gyro which is lamb, a yogurt sauce, tomatoes and lettuce in a pita type bread. I absolutley cannot stand lamb, I refuse to eat it not because of the taste but...it's a lamb...a fuzzy cute...anyways...  YES I broke down and ate it. I was super starving and it didn't really taste like how I remembered when I first tried lamb...it was really good. My aunt had a veggie platter and everyone also had a gyro and my sister had a gyro platter.  I will come back here again when we visit the family, I think it is probably a staple and as for the lamb...probably the only time I will ever eat it, if it's in a gyro at Haji-Baba.",

    "text": "I feel like the Haji-Baba experience is a coming of age one for Yelpers, and now I can join the club!  I came here today for lunch with Jon S. and our friend. We were quickly seated at a table in a mostly full dining room. Got our menus and our server came by soon enough to take our drink orders. Per other yelpers, I had the Turkish coffee with some water. Jon S. ordered some babaganush (btw excuse my spelling for this whole review, their menu isn't online so I have no idea how to spell these things). HEED THE ADVICE OF THOSE who say splurge the extra 30 something cents and get the handmade pita. It is worlds better than what you would get otherwise.   So we munched on the babag and pita and decided what to get. Our friend had been there once before and she got one of the veggie sandwiches, and because there's so much on the menu, Jon and I each got the combination plate. Not too long after, everything came out pretty quickly and hot. Even though I looked at what came with the plate, I had no idea what I was eating so I took it one item at a time.   Gyro meat = BOMB. mmm it was so good.   Not-handmade pita bread = disappointing after having the homemade  version.   Kibbi = I would compare it to the American meatloaf. It was a loaf that was tasty but a little dry.   Falafel = I was full when I got to tasting he falafel, but I really liked it.   Fried egg roll = Can't remember if there was another name for this, but it was surprisingly good. Filled with a bunch of beef, very good.  Stuffed grape leaves = Jon kinda hyped this up as he had heard good things about it. Eh, I guess it's an acquired taste, it was pretty bland, but tolerable when dipped in tzatziki.   Tabouli = the \"salad' on the plate. It was pretty citrusy and bitter for my taste, but Jon really liked it.   And I think that covers everything. While I wasn't a HUGE fan of the entire meal, it was definitely fresh, homemade, and a quality meal. And even though we tried a bunch of stuff, it wasn't nearly everything on the menu. I'll certainly be back.",

The falafel was moist, flavorful the lettuce was fresh and there was a copious amount of sauce to cover it. The pita was a bit thin but that can be over looked. At under $3 it might be worthwhile to get two.   As for the hummous we had on the side, it was a great texture but a bit low on flavor. Make sure you order an extra pita and it comes with just one.   We got the order to go so we did not really have any service to review.    When you first walk in you are assaulted by the smells of many spices and many other alien things to most Americans.   There is an attached small market full of spices, and exotics foods and flavored tobaccos for those under 21 who seek a vice. The counter is full of many types of balaclava and olives.  If you want a great falafel pita at a good price, be brave and stop in. Just leave your Pro Bush / Israel gear in the car.",

Big array of baklava, cheeses, olives etc.  In the restaurant, usual gyro, kafta and shish kebab platters can sandwiches or salads.  Additionally find items like shawerema and koubideh.  Combination plates and many sides.   Great service and friendly staff.  Basic dining area inside and out.",

And I've been to the middle-east 4 times now so I really do know what great middle-eastern food is like. The food here is somewhat lacking in taste and a bit dense and heavy. I was expecting real middle-eastern rice, with raisins, carrots, etc. White rice just doesn't do it.",

I met a friend of mine here who also hadn't been here in a while.   I ordered the chicken shawarma sandwich, usually a standard choice to judge how the food is. Honestly, it was pretty boring and ordinary, nothing special about it. My friend ordered the falafel plate and baba ghanoush. I tried the smoky eggplant dip and liked it, it added some variety when I put it on my sandwich. I need to try more menu items to get a better feel of what they offer.   Service here is quick and friendly, I ended up buying something from their store as they have a neat selection of items for purchase.",

I went in for lunch and though it was busy and I was alone, I still got seated and served pretty quickly.   I love the falafel pita and tabouli. The tea was good for just a hot tea as well. Maybe it's the atmosphere that makes it all so good? Or maybe it's that they do what they know and do it well? For me, this is a staple in the valley for middle eastern cuisine. It warms my heart that after all of these years they're still there and seem to do well.   The tahini is perfect, the falafel is perfect I love the halva.   They have a market area with many items that I'm familiar with growing up in Toronto and I've been surprised what I've seen there although admittedly, I believe the only thing I've ever purchased are the seamen snaps.  Anyhow, I imagine Haji-Baba will always be a favorite of mine even though the staff behind the counter aren't always the most chipper I've encountered, it's just that good.",

I love when the pita bread is burned a little bit because I prefer the crispier taste. The plate comes with chicken, rice, hummus, and tabouli. I prefer this place over pita jungle to be honest. The location is small, but the food is always good and consistent. :)  The grocery store is cool to browse around after you're done eating. They have spices and other cool treats for cheap. I would try the Baklava if I were you. One of the best Baklavas I have ever had.  Tip: When you're done eating, you pay at the grocery store.",

The kababs were well cooked. Later, we picked Pistachio and Cashew Bakhlava. They have I guess 6 different kinds of Bakhlava, Pistachio, Cashew, walnut, Almond and one other. Bakhlava was better than other options definitely. We would love to go again for the food annd its reasonable price!!!",

What makes this dish so good and delicious is I think the way Haji-Baba marinates and grills the chicken. And the chicken that comes out of the grill is tender, juicy and bursting with flavor - it is simply delicious. I've also had their chicken and beef kabobs and they are OK; taste wise the kabobs don't even come close to the chicken served in the Shawarma.   Also important to make note of is their Hummus; it is well prepared and can be eaten with a pita or used as excellent dipping sauce if you order kabobs.",

The hummus and baba ghanoush were cool. I had never had baba before and probably won't again, but I will say it was very well prepared and presented. So no bad comments about, it's just not my thing.   I got the lamb tongue pita sandwich. Oh sweet baby Jesus that thing was so good. The meat was tender and delicious. I tried to eat with manners but didn't. I inhaled that thang! I put some hummus on it and perfect!",

I ordered a shawarma and wanted a SIDE of rice. The menu states SIDES. The small table we were seated at could not fit these so called sides because they were large plates of food. Why would it say side and not a plate of rice. The sides basically served all four of us. The food was just as bad as the experience. We tried to check out and we're basically ignored till we had to make noise we had been waiting 20 minutes. Not worth the wait, trouble or 5 plates of sides.",

    "text": "Haji Baba is the restaurant (and store) I always refer to as the Gold Standard of Middle Eastern restaurants in the Valley.  To be honest, I've had better Middle Eastern food; but what they offer, how much of it they give you, and the stellar service provided, easily makes this restaurant THE place to beat.  The most-memorable item on their menu is their dolmas, which, I admit, I didn't like when I first tried them, but have since fallen in love with:  fat, with a unique filling I can't really describe and served hot. ( If, like me, you are used to the small, cold, rice-filled dolmas, you really need to try these and keep an open mind.)   Typically, I get the vegetarian platter, which, like most of what they serve, comes with copious amounts of tabooli, hummus, felafel, yoghurt (sort of like tzatziki, but not quite), dolmas, etc.  If you have a big appetite -- and readers of my reviews know I'm gluttonous -- you will NOT be hungry when you leave this place!  My partner is a fan of their gyro sandwich, which, not surprisingly, is big and tasty.  Haji Baba also has a store taking up half the establishment offering a variety of foods and other items from the Middle East and Bosnia.  They also sell fresh Feta (get the Greek, not the Bulgarian), Burek (a cheese-filled pastry), decent baklava and many other things unavailable in the Valley at very reasonable prices.  Disadvantage (for me)?  They're all the way in Tempe; so if you live west of I-17, bring a book and lots of water for your haj across the Valley to get here!  One more important note:  I read, with much amusement, the review from someone complaining that she showed up here in an evening gown only to find out the place is \"one step above a fast-food place.\"  Honestly, that's no exaggeration:  show up here overdressed and don't be surprised if you see people doubling-up in hysterical laughter and running to the bathroom to avoid peeing their pants.  Most of the customers frequenting Haji Baba are students from nearby ASU, local workers on lunch break and your average, every day 'proletariat', as I'm sure the complaining reviewer would refer to them as being.  Haji Baba is by no means fancy; but if you're looking for good food served by friendly employees, who work their rears off, moving fast to serve you and ensure you leave happy with your experience, then this is the place for you.  I've been coming here on and off for more than 15 years now and not once -- NOT ONCE -- have I ever had a complaint or issue with anything there.  If only for the fact I've had better Middle Eastern food in other, less worthy restaurants, I would've given them five stars.",

Their gyro meat is very well done, and if I have any criticism, it would be they slice their gyro meat off the spit in much too large of slices.  It's not overseasoned or particular greasy, very tender.  When ordering with the plate, it comes with a side salad on house dressing and a helping of rice.  There's nothing particularly to the rice and they offer way, way too much - enough for several days worth of leftovers.  I'm also not too impressed with the side salad - the dressing is a bit salty and my salad was overdressed.  The falafel are fantastic.  Crispy, slightly crumbling, slightly moist, great for some delicious hummus dipping.  Haji-Baba is part sit-down restaurant, part counter-service restaurant, part Middle Eastern market, and it all somehow makes total sense when you step inside.  Prices are excellent.  Service is friendly.  A casual, inexpensive place to grab lunch or pick up some snacks.",

The wholesale warehouse a ways down the street is now open to the public and has more of a selection for grocery stuff.  The restaurant is known for the food, not the service. They have a simple menu, hand cooked food, and cheap prices. Falafel is tasty and they have a good selection of necessities; tabbouleh, gyro meat, rice, salads, pitas, and dessert. You can go in and get the food for take out, or take a seat for a quick bite on the other half of the store.  I would highly recommend the chicken shawarma plate. You'll be stuffed if you finish the whole thing, but I always want more, and as soon as I leave I think of the next time I get to go back and get it again. It has a great sampling of the best seasoned tabbouleh I've had at a restaurant, creamy hummus and some amazing garlic sauce. The chicken is moist and you cannot go wrong with putting sumac on everything (the dark red spice in the glass shaker on the table). Finish off with some of the amazing baklava and you'll be all set for the day!  Staff is friendly, and this place is worth going to if you need middle eastern spices and canned goods that you can't get at a normal grocery store.",

Haji-Baba offers solid, down-home Mediterranean/Middle Eastern food at very reasonable prices and the well-equipped store make this a worthwhile stop for any ethnic food lover.    One half of Haji-Baba is a small, tightly packed ethnic food store.  The other half is a small, tightly packed restaurant.  While space is certainly limited on both sides, the selection at Haji-Baba is huge!  The store side features everything from large pans of fresh-baked pastries and desserts behind the counter to rows of hard to find spices and aisles of rare, imported ingredients at prices that make exotic cooking at home reasonable for the casual cook like me!  The restaurant side delivers good, authentic food at acceptable prices.  None of the menu items are particularly unique and the overall quality of the food tends to match the cafe styling more than fine dining, but all of the dishes I've tried have been well portioned and tasty!  Space is very limited, though, so groups larger than 4-6 aren't suggested.  Don't hesitate to stop here if you're in the area!  Even if you're not hungry, Haji-Baba has a lot to offer!",

    "text": "If you're a Tempe/Mesa native or an ASU student or alum, then you probably know Haji-Baba. I, however, am neither and only recently discovered this awesome place by way of a recommendation on Twitter.  Since then, I've been there five times and have tried nearly everything on the menu. The food is delicious! Seriously, there hasn't been one thing I've tried that I haven't enjoyed.  On my first trip, I ordered the combination. I highly recommend doing this if you've never eaten here before. This plate gives you a great sampling of what their menu has to offer and a generous portion at that. It's easily enough for two people and, at only around $12, a great deal too.  On my most recent visit, I had the Gyro plate; again amazing! A very generous portion served with a delicious salad, a side of rice, and I topped the meal off with an Arabic coffee.  Haji-Baba is not really a secret and the place will get very busy at lunch time. If you want to eat there, go for an early or late lunch, otherwise you'll have to wait for a table; it's worth it!  They have a large menu and great prices, and if you don't have time to stay and eat, you can order to-go from the counter.  The staff do a good job, but their food is so good, I'd still eat there if a server punched me in the face every time I walked in the door.  If you haven't tried it, you need to go there. If you have, then you know just how great Haji-Baba is.",

    "text": "I've only eaten in the restaurant part of this place once several years ago but was looking to buy black Cardammon to use in making this home-made hard liquor based hot sauce that I read about in the Jan/Feb 2011 edition of Saveur magazine (number 25 of the 100 items identified as chefs' favorites), referred to as boozy hot sauce (I had something like it in Okinawa in November, which the locals make to put on their noodles, it was amazing). The prices on the spices were amazingly cheap and I bought several other spice items for when I do Indian based cooking (lentils are good for you but man they need some spices to taste interesting).  I had the good fortune to talk with the owner of the establishment. He told me the prices are so affordable because he deals with ethnic clientele  who use lots of spices and simply will not pay the sort of prices one sees in most stores. However, he assured me that he buys his spices in small batches (like 5 pounds) and then breaks them up himself and he checks everything when it comes in, if it doesn't smell fresh he sends it back and noted that he has a large base of customers that just buy from him for the spices.   My challenge, of course, is I don't know much at all about Middle Eastern cooking but if you are going to do it, this seems the place to buy the ingredients.",

This little Middle Eastern market/cafe is definitely what you'd call a \"hole in the wall.\"  It's a real mom and pop shop, so don't come here looking for atmosphere.  That's not what this place is about.  I will now attempt to tell you what this place IS about.  On our last visit, it'd probably been well over a year since we'd been in, but our server (really nice guy) not only remembered us, he remembered our usual orders: two iced teas, hummus served with pita for app, then the Gyros De-lux.  And though it was our usual order, we've tried just about everything on the menu and I can honestly say I've never had anything bad there.  And at prices not much higher than fast food, you absolutely cannot beat the value here.  Great, delicious, quality food at a great price, plus a bonus: the people are wonderful.  Haji-Baba ftw!",

    "text": "Ever since the wife got a tattoo just up the road from this place, giving us an excuse to eat here for the first time (see my original review), I've been jonesing for more. Fortunately, she booked in for another tattoo a couple of days ago which gave us another excuse to travel the 45 miles and have another bite at the Casa la Dinge. Unfortunately, the way the day played out meant that I headed in to Tempe with her, then had to kill about three hours waiting for her tattoo to be completed. During this time I met some friends and because I was starving I wound up having a quasi-lunch with them at Slices Pizza at the cnr of 6th and Mill. Doh! The wife wouldn't have tolerated me doing Haji Baba's with them because SHE wanted to join me at HB for a late lunch. I thus had two lunches on the day, but because I wasn't too hungry after she and I arrived at HB, I had to make do with a couple of appetizers. I ordered the Foul Mudammas, the falafel and the yoghurt soda. The soda made me shudder at the unexpected taste, but I did manage to strangle down about half of it, with a face that probably appeared to onlookers as though I was being cornholed with a pineapple. Reminded me a lot of salt lassi, except this was saltier. Basically like drinking salty melted butter out of a bag of Orville Redenbacher. The wife grimaced at her first swallow, then came back a few minutes later for another go-round (that's my girl!) I can see why the damn stuff is popular - in a Warheads-candy sort of way. The Mudammas was pretty good, but my gut was quite full by this time and I didn't even finish the falafels. Oh well. Wife had the chicken kabob, same as last time I think - the plate was overloaded and the food was delicious, once again.  After we finished I started with the usual wandering up and down the aisles looking at the weird foods and their names. Wife said she needed to hit the restroom. About a minute later she was back, with sort of a guilty wan smile on her face. I was wondering whether the crapper was out of order or something else funny had happened. I was wrong. Apparently the previous occupant had dropped a couple of foul mudammas of his own in the bog, and the stench was so rancid that my wife threw up almost all of her meal. I kid you not. She said she struggled to hold her breath but in the end, blammo. By this time I was doing the potty dance as well and with more than a little trepidation went to the restroom. I sniffed (WHY?!) but the smell had cleared out by now and it was tolerable. However, the toilet fixtures themselves were disgraceful. I took a couple of photos of the faucet (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=R-J7WlBAZ7cGGRMTetoRxA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmG...</a>), and the string holding their mirror above the sink (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmGT-7QjowR1ihup3FbVA?select=DkWNs54J3xmfmZ1KHX2CbA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/2GmG...</a>). If they're going for realistic Arabic slum atmosphere and decor at this place, congrats - they hit the mark one hundred percent. Please, DON'T go into the restroom if you visit this place.. you'll spend the rest of the day, like I did, wondering if the kitchen fixtures look the same. Spoiled the experience for me, and there's NO reason they can't renovate such a tiny room and make it at least a little more passable. Made the shitter in \"Trainspotting\" look like the jewelry counter at Harrods.  Three stars (two knocked off for the state of the restroom, and I'm not counting the stench/vomiting incident in this demerit), and my brief addiction has been broken. I probably won't go here again since it transcends even my fairly liberal, old-city standards of cleanliness. Cheap food, good tasting, generous portions, I didn't get food poisoning, and the cashew baklava was awesome, but next time we're in town I'll probably go back to Slices Pizza or look for an alternate Middle Eastern fix. Then again, Greek Wraps is closer and just as tasty. And no, owner of Chicago Gyros, they didn't pay me to say that. Seacrest out.",

You sit and you order off their double-sided laminated menu and you wait. You're hungry as hell and you've got a tenner burning a hole in your pocket.  And then they arrive and you squirm up until the first bite. Then, it's like an explosion of all things holy inside your mouth (That's what she said!).  Their hummus is amazing, feta cheese is da bomb! (I only use this saying in SER-ious situations), and, beyond the food, their service is primo.  Always smiling, the servers will answer your questions kindly, especially if you're a first timer or non-frequenter.  The atmosphere might seem a bit unorganized, but who gives a shit. This place has good food, and if you're coming here for atmosphere, you're not coming for the right reasons. The bathrooms are always clean, albeit tucked away oddly, but whatevs.  I've gone here with vegan and meat-eating friends alike, and all at once (ask me about it, it's quite a story), and we've all come out with both our faces and stomachs happy.  The one kicker: they only do take-out on Sundays. But don't let that stop you, and trust me, it won't. Go, and enjoy.  P.s. Their regular coffee (not Arabic coffee, a.k.a. mud in a cup) is damn-well near perfect if it's up to me. Straight without milk or sugar (and I like my sugar with coffee and cream, thank you Beastie Boys!), this coffee is delicious.",

The few skeptics must have not taste for good food or must come from Middle Eastern families and hate anything not cooked by their mothers and grandmothers.  Haji-Baba is one of the better Middle Eastern eateries I have had the pleasure to try.  Not just in Tempe but anywhere (including NYC and Toronto).  I had the shish kebab plate that included generous portions of rice and salad along with the chunks of lamb.  It came with a pita slice too.    It's an unorthodox place.  You're given a ticket that you present to the cashier.  Anything you may purchase from the grocery side will be added.  If you cook you might enjoy the wide variety of spices and other items for sale.  They even sell a few edibles from Croatia and Serbia.  Be sure to try the baklava.  They have a few varieties.  I tried the Queen Baklava and it was fantastic.  One of the best I've had.",

    "text": "In my experience the middle eastern eateries in the Phoenix area all hover around mediocrity.  This place is on the cusp of greatness but is held back with weak supporting dishes.  When I come here I normally get the Sultani or the mixed kabob plate. While the meat is tender, moist, and grilled to perfection it is complemented by subpar basmati rice or hummus that tastes like it came straight from a can. The tabbouleh is ok though.  Their appetizers are also on the wrong side of mediocrity. In addition to the gastronomic catastrophe that they call hummus, their sambusek and fuul is also thoroughly unimpressive. I have lived in Egypt so I know what good fuul tastes like and trust me that is not it. It tasted like it came straight from the can.     Lets end on a positive note though. The meat is succulent and by in large the food is reasonably priced and the service is prompt and friendly. In addition adjoining the eating area is a small market so if you need halal meat in Tempe or any other essentials of Muslim cuisine its worth your time to grab lunch and then do some shopping.",

It's half a restaurant and half a grocery market, so don't be surprised with that. Seating is a bit limited, as the entirety of the venue isn't really that big. But, it's never been an issue for me to be seated.   Perfect for a lunch with a few friends, or even a casual dinner date - show that special someone you met on OK Cupid how cultured you are! Also, it's the complete opposite of douchey, so you're good to go!   Enjoy!",

The overwhelming spicy aroma encompasses you and you really do feel like you have found yourself in a 'whole new world' (as Aladdin would say).  It almost leads to you believe that you just might have a magic carpet out front waiting to fly you home.   Something about Haji Baba stirs up thoughts of romance... maybe its the lamb tongue sandwhich or the hummus platter.  Either way, be careful who you choose to dine with... you might just end up finding True love.

We had about a 10 minute wait, which was enough to wander around the grocery store and check out the extensive spice selection.  After being seated, we selected the veggie combo plate and the sultani plate.  There was a TON of food, talk about value! the baba ganoush (smoky eggplant) was spot on perfect, and the pita bread that accompanied it was toasted and warm, which was a great touch!  Tabouleh was also really good, and the falafel was moist and had a great texture.  The only meh item on the veggie combo plate was the grape leaves - they were warm, but didn't have a whole lot of flavor.  In contrast, the koobideh and the grilled beef were extremely flavorful.  The meal plate came with salad as well as rice, but the meat was definitely the star.  Service was friendly and perfunctory.  A no frills, here for the food, leave with a belly ache because you ate so much land of goodness!",

I had a veggie platter and also ordered a falafel sandwich to go! The baba ghanouj (sp?, depending who you ask) was the best I've ever had. Hummus was top-notch - very smooth and creamy. Tabbouleh (again, sp?, depending who you ask) was a little leafier than I like. My meat-eating family members raved about their gyro and chicken shawarma, too.  Extra particulars: Went with my father and brother after catching a spring training baseball game. It was fairly late, but we slid in about 15 mins before closing and they didn't glare at us, so that was nice. The service was friendly and efficient. The layout of the place seems a little odd - grocery store on one side, casual restaurant on the other side - but I dug it. Overall, a great casual place to get some really good, fresh and healthy food for a great price.",

It's rare it  knocks your socks, but it does happen sometimes and it's glorious when it does. There were pickles in the sandwich which seemed a little out of place. The tabouli and falafel were probably the best I've had. Grape leaves were good too. The hommus unfortunately was not that good...

    "text": "I had the pleasure of living across the street from this treasure for about 6 years. I'm still lucky enough to work close by.   Let me be clear. I 'm reviewing Haji Baba as a GROCERY STORE first.  Then I will give you some insight into the prepared food for take-out or in-store dining.  This is one of the few stores in Arizona where you have several choices for pita bread--it's also the ONLY place I've found for whole wheat pita. There are several choices for Feta cheese. Danish, French,Greek...same with olives--there are choices. I ALWAYS buy my tahini here. All the prices are very inexpensive.  Need spices???  They have them all.  At about 25% of the price you would pay anywhere else. The best way to describe Haji Baba is that it is a REAL grocery store, with REAL prices, for REAL people.  It is NOT a \"specialty store\" with trendy items and inflated prices.  They sell food items that you will actually use.  The bonus here?  You won't find a 10 year old can or jar of something.  On to the \"restaurant\" portion.  Haji Baba is better if you think of it as a take-out joint that happens to have places to sit and eat.  They do have tables and they do perform table service, it's just got zero charm.  You go for the food, that's it.  Okay, food.  The lamb tongue sandwich is to die for.  Let me repeat.  The LAMB TONGUE PITA SANDWICH.  GET IT!  Their baba ganouj is also darned tootin' tasty.  Actually, I sometimes dream about their baba ganouj. I'm not crazy about their hummus, maybe because making hummus takes 5 minutes and mine is bomb? But it's not bad. Gyros are good and not greasy. Greasy gyro meat is a pet peeve of mine. Chicken shwarma?  Yup, that's good too. I'm sure I've had something  to eat  here that I was a little disappointed in, but I honestly can't remember what, or when .",

The garlic sauce is mayo based, the pita is weird, my husband wasn't in love with the gyros, and everything other than the chicken could have used more flavor, including the hummus. Service was not great - very slow and I had to ask for a spoon about 3 times. Worst of all, this place should be called the dirty baba. The floor under our table was DISGUSTING, like something had been spilled a week ago and never mopped up. Still better than other middle eastern spots I have had so far but then keep in mind I am from Detroit where the middle eastern food is top notch. Nothing here comes close, or hasn't yet.",

    "text": "Whoa, Yelp - you really shined on this one! Reading several Yelps describing the great prices, portions and quality I had to see for myself... The location is conveniently close to the ASU campus, though you need to be ready for the turn as the place is a little hard to spot..    Wanting to spice things up for a looong Monday I felt compelled to follow the suggestions of 6-year Haji-Babanian veteran Alexis R. and went for the lamb tongue sandwich with babaganooj appetizer. The baba' came out first, quickly and with accompanying pita bread - bursting with flavor.. I'm glad the sandwich came out fast too, else I miss the chance to throw some 'ganoush in there for good measure.    The sandwich was tasty, and different (and my supernormal appetite would not have protested more meat).. Would try again, likely in the 'platter' form that includes more food and variety for under $10.    This would suffice for a good review yet the place is half devoted to a cultural grocery store! I had a nice chat with Mohammad up front, picked up 2 varieties of baklava for dessert and a packet of beef shwarma spices for a future attempt at some home cookin'!",

    "text": "OMG This place is more of knick knacks and pulses and Indo afghani spices, pulses and etc. Also on right corner they have little corner ( Not very little ) cafe where you are served food. I ordered Falafel $ 2.99. It came with 3 Falafels with Lettuce and Tomatoes and some sort of curd mix to Grip Lettuce and tomatoes and 2 Pita's . FAlafel is made of fava and garbanzo grounded with spices and deep fried balls.Totally Worth it. It's not spicy at all. So you can add Hot Sauce , Black pepper- available as condiments. Trust me Its more Like Gyrco .The only difference is it comes as wrap when you order and has meat in it. However falafel comes Pita that you can wrap in lettuce, tomatoes and 1 and half falafel for I Pita and Hot sauce and pich of Black Pepper. On the other end Gyro is $ 3.99 I guess. So $2.99 Is inexpensive and when you are veggie eater. Go for Falafel. I had 2 comrades, 1 ordered Gyro, 2nd  ordered Fava Beans and Basmati Rice. it is high quality (Long Grained Rice_ It looks like it is Zafrani for sure. It was in large portions.. It was something $ 3.49 or $3.99.   Almost all things they serve have large portions..and quiet reasonable You feel full when you eat there.Good Mediterranean Food with Large Portions.  Also they have fresh Feta Chese at $ 4.40 approx per pound. Not bad at all. I am to try try that when i head there again. I will post pictures when i go again. I had no battery to take pictures.  Alright Folks Have a great weekend. Bye for now. TC  Sundays They open at 11 A.M.",

With Haja-baba this is True, but it also comes at such a great value!    I've sampled the hummus, which is wonderful in its simplicity and very fresh.  Same with the tabouli.  The kibbie is brilliant and I will order that again.  On my first visit, I tried the Shish-kabob and, to my delight, they treated the lamb very kindly.  It wasn't brown and cooked to death, which is so often the fate of lamb in far too many restaurants.    On my last visit, a friend and i went to Haja-baba's with one intention: Lamb's tongue Sandwich.  If you like lamb and you're not mouth-squimish concerning texture; it's one of the best things you'll ever eat.  For me, it was heaven.  I will say, that I did order and dress it with a touch of tzatziki sauce, which made the sandwich PERFECT!  The portion, especially for the price, is as astounding as it is tasty!  There's a very short list of things that will make me drive to Tempe.  Haji-baba's is near the top of that list.",

We started with baba ghanouj, which was quite good. I went on to the chicken schwarma, which I adore, but was more like a chicken pita sandwich than I care for. I expect it to be more of a wrap. The chicken was sproingy and there was a ton of lettuce, but the non-sproingy chicken and the garlic sauce were flavorful.  So, I guess what I'd say is that a 5-star friend can save a 3-star meal any day.",

The food is super inexpensive, and everything was not only delicious, but super authentic!!  My husband and I ordered the olives (delicious and multi-colored), yummy humus (and I'm quite picky about humus), tabouli salad and two felafel wraps.  The portions are not enormous, so we were able to try all of this and finish most of it without needing to be wheeled out.  This is hands down the best felafel we've had - crispy on the outside, soft on the inside, full of flavor but not at all greasy.  The hummus has wonderful texture and taste (I'm picky about hummus), the pita bread is fresh and soft, the olives are flavorful (not too dry or too oily, multicolored), and the tabouli salad is some of the best I've had (chopped perfectly with a little couscous and flavors - delish).   The little cafe is super low-key and has cute murals on the walls, and the service is friendly and quick.  After lunch, we picked up some locally baked lavosh bread and some chocolate bars, and out total, uncluding lunch, was still just under $20!  We can't wait to come back!!",

I lived across the street from this place when I was in college and absolutely loved it. My family would insist that we go every time they were in town. That was almost 20 years ago and now that I've moved back to Arizona 10 years ago, I'm still going.   What's even more amazing is that the same wonderful people that ran the place then, are still running it now and making the same fantastic food. While the prices have increased in almost 20 years, it's certainly not noticeable over that duration of time. The place is extremely affordable and delicious. You will not find a better hummus in the valley. The chicken salad is absolutely one of my favorite things in the world to eat after a good workout as it's a wonderful mix of salad, rice, and tasty chicken. I can honestly say that I don't think I've tried another gyro in the last 10 years since I've been going here. So while I can't say if there's one better out there, but theirs is a certainly amazing. But I will warn you that there is a pickle hidden inside of it! I wasn't expecting that the first time I tried it all those years ago but now I've gotten used to it and simply pull it out and eat it separately.  I can't post a review without at least mentioning decor. This is a very low-key, no-frills restaurant located inside a grocery store. You are going there for the food and not the atmosphere. But if you do decide to have a seat (there will probably be a wait if you go around lunch during the week), I promise you that you will get great service from this family run place. I have never had a bad experience there in 20 years!",

The entry is between the store shop and restaurant, and there is not much room to stand at the front. We had walked towards the back of the store and had a waiter tell us, \"There's a line\" and walk away. Still unsure of where to go, we went back to the front, and waited. Despite this first impression, we stayed, and I'm glad we did. The food was amazing. My brother got the lamb tongue and it was surprisingly good; the meat was super tender and flavorful. I got the chicken salad which was amazing. It came on a bed of rice that I really liked with the salad. Even the iced tea I got had a unique blend of spices that made it special.  In the store part, there are so many options and it is well organized. Our waiter was great and helped us with recommendations. I'm so glad I found this place and I'll definitely be coming back!",

The food was served fresh and in large portions, ready to be devoured after only a short period of time. The servers were friendly and attentive, and so there was no problem at all ordering.  Seating may be limited, so do anticipate a bit of a wait during peak times. I definitely don't recommend sitting at one of the outside tables during one of Arizona's famously hot summer days though, but hey, if you got places to go to and people to see, then perhaps you just want to be seated quickly. The only downside is that they may be serving tap water, instead of filtered water.",

    "text": "Haji-Baba was the first Middle Eastern restaurant I visited when I moved the Valley 20 years ago that made me say \"Yes! There is good food in Phoenix.\" The restaurant has remained consistently excellent and inexpensive ever since.   I usually get the vegan trinity - hummus, tabouli and falafel - in some combo or another. The hummus is thicker than most - maybe less tahini - but fresh and full of flavor. The tabouli is heavier on the parsley side but lightly seasoned with lemon and olive oil The falafels are the the main attraction though. Either in a pita or on a platter, they are clearly fresh (not frozen) and fried to perfection. They are crisp on the inside, soft and warm inside.   The restaurant is not fancy. I think they're probably the same tables and chairs I sat in 20 years ago. But the excellent falafel pitas are only $3.99. I'd sit on the floor for that! Although they are often busy, service is efficient and friendly. You pay at the counter, so you can go shopping before cashing out! My only request is that they label items on the menu as vegan, but I've only noticed them updating the menu once in 20 years so I doubt that will happen!",

The market had a great selection of things I haven't found anywhere else in the US. My mother lived in both Saudi and Qatar and I was lucky enough to visit. This market reminded me of being there - if you're a cost plus person head over to Haji Baba! You won't be disappointed.   As for the restaurant, oh my goodness. We started with the falafel and olives. The falafel was crisp and fresh and the sauce was perfectly seasoned. We both had the chicken shawarma plate. The hummus was very smooth with a great flavor. The chicken was INCREDIBLE. The serving sizes were very generous, I was not able to finish mine.   The atmosphere is casual and relaxed. The staff is friendly enough. I cannot wait to come back!",

Every mouth watering bite of food danced and melted on my tongue like little snowflakes on a winter day but with flavor!

Very accommodating and impressively fast service!   FOOD: The chicken tasted incredible, rice perfection, gyro tender as can be and flavorful, HUMMUS PHENOMENAL, and Handmade heaven(Hand made pita). One of our guys showed up shortly before the cooks were finished(about 10mins) and was served with the same consistency even though it minutes from shutting down.  In conclusion for this restaurant to be in  humble spot with that amount of dedication to craft and quality in the Tempe area is a True gem. DO NOT SLEEP on this place. There's a reason they've stayed in business AT THE TOP for decades. Organic.   Thanks for being a real one guys!",

Their stuffed grape leaves are super tasty-by far the best! Even their hummus is extra creamy and delicious & the rice is always cooked to perfection. It tastes on point each time I've visited-it's always nice to get your expectations met when spending your money on eating out.   Omg I almost forgot the mixed fruit juice!!

We stopped by for dinner and it was starting to get busy when we arrived. There aren't too many tables but they were definitely doing their best to clean them as soon as people were done.   We were helped right away and menus were given to us. They have sandwiches and a ton of entrees to pick from. We decided to order one shish kabob, one gyro plate, and a chicken schwarma plate.   My chicken schwarma was delicious! It came with a ton of chicken, hummus, delicious basmati rice, and a piece of pita. My husband had the shish kabob plate and the also came with rice, grilled vegetables, and a side salad. He also had a small guava drink for $3.50 (no refill) but it was well worth it.  Each plate was priced about $10 each. We spent about $45 and were there about an hour. Portions are really big and so we still had food leftover.   I would definitely be back to try the chicken schwarma in the sandwich style.",

Despite several tries, I totally agree that Mediterranean is not for me. Had only 1 option to eat..lol  Ordered - veggie Combo: apparently tasted good though. The grape leaves wrap was the best on the plate. Hummus was eggplant based and tasted 3/5. Tamarino Juice : I got to try this for first time in USA. Impressive taste.   Overall, decent lowkey ambience. No music, quick service.",

This place is great, easy to get to, and has almost everything you need at reasonable prices.   My friend loves the food here. He has sampled most things on the menu and has fallen in love with the chicken shawarma.  About once every three weeks, he can speak of nothing else until he gets an order of shawarma. I love the spanakopita and the vegetarian sampler. The apricot juice is great too. Really intense flavor, but really refreshing. Also, a great selection of baklava. Cashew is my favorite so far.  The market/grocery side is great too! Lots of wonderful things for cooking at great prices. We found black mustard seeds here after looking everywhere in town and coming up empty handed. And let me tell you about the dates! Best prices in town to buy dates.   I don't think there is anything else I can say, you must go here and love the food.",

    "text": "I've been to Haji-Baba's a couple of times now and I must say... my visits have not been met with consistency in the quality of their food.    Haji-Baba is SUPER popular as you can see by the Yelp reviews of this place.  The main reason for their popularity I think is due to their prices.  Their prices are almost ridiculously low for the portion sizes you get when compared to other Mediterranean ~ Greek type of restaurants.       I did find something I liked at Haji-Baba. I recommend you try their Gyros.  It's a really good Gyros and is one of the best in the Phoenix metro.  They don't shave their Gyros meat like at the other places.  They cut their Gyros meat off in long chunks, different sizes.  This adds another level of \"delicious-ness\" when compared to Gyros at other locations.    They OVER STUFF their Gyros with meat, a small amount of tomatoes, red onions and pickled wild cucumbers with some tzatziki sauce.  The pickled wild cucumbers were unexpected and a nice change from other plaecs that serve Gyros.  My Gyros needed a bit more tzatziki, but my server was slammed and forgot it, oh well.  As for everything else on their menu ~ meh, I've had better.  Their dolmades, rice and kibbee all tasted old and over cooked.  The shawarma and falafels also tasted over cooked and were very dry for my liking.    Restaurant location and condition~ 2 to 3 stars Service ~ 3 stars Food ~ 2 to 3 stars (except for the Gyros which are 4.5 stars) Prices ~ 5 plus stars  I'm looking forward to going back for another Gyros and maybe I'll try their hummus and/or a Greek salad on my next.  Hope to see you there.",

    "text": "I rediscovered Haji Baba recently, after eating here years ago and remembering it for having great, reasonably priced Middle Eastern food.  Coming here again, I am sad I didn't come here sooner after moving back to Arizona!  The chicken shawarma is to die for.  Perfectly grilled chicken is complemented with moist fluffy long grain rice, fresh tabbouli, excellent hummus, and an exquisite whipped garlic sauce.  They have some of the best hummus I've had since moving back here.  I've also been happy with their kibbee dish, which is kind of like the Middle Eastern version of meatloaf.  Food is prepared quickly, and while they do charge $.50 for any soda refills, I don't mind so much as long as they keep making that divine chicken shawarma.  I've also tried their vegetarian combo plate, and while I appreciate the enormous amount of food and great variety they give you with this dish, I think their main forte is in their meat dishes.",

The second location is much bigger and offer more of a variety of Mediterranean foods at very good costs. If your in the area and want a taste for mediterranean, check this place out.",

    "text": "TL;dr amazing mediterranean food, with plenty of meat options that will blow your mind. you've never had meat like this before.  I'm really confused as to how I don't have a review for this place already. After living in Tempe/Phoenix for over 20 years, I remember craving gyros from Haji Baba even as a kid. In fact, I would venture to say Haji Baba and Baiz Market are the oldest, quality middle eastern shops in the valley.  Apparently my friend has never been here before, and I decided I would be a terrible friend if I never took him. Of course, he had trouble finding it because he thought it was a restaurant \"restaurant\" and not a hole-in-the-wall type place.  We were seated even though it was lunch, didn't take more than 10 minutes for our gyro plates to come out which were piled high with succulent gyro meat. To perfectly complement the star of the dish, there was white rice and a salad with plenty of unique dressing. Gyro meat by itself is usually amazing, simply because its meat, but when its accompanied with an amazing sauce, it really becomes stellar. The \"white sauce\" or what I think is an iteration of tsaziki sauce is perfect for the juicy ground lamb meat. If you haven't had gyro before and you want to give a try, I would definitely get the gyro plate at Haji Baba.  I almost forgot to mention that you can't leave Haji Baba without trying their baklava. Take your pick at which nuts you want. pistachio, almonds, walnuts, mixed, etc.   Aside from their restaurant food, my family usually buys groceries from here. One of our staples is pita bread, and you can usually get a box of pita bread for like $13. Freeze some of it, and use the rest as you wish. It goes perfectly with store bought hummus and foul (fava beans).",

    "text": "Thank You Erica.O and Praise to Allah that I finally found some Baklava worthy of the sacred journey through my Gullet.  Now onto the rest of my review, I met a friend for lunch, I started by ordering the Hummus and a Spanakopita (see pics)   The hummus was good, although I didn't get the the thick fresh pita I saw everyone else eating? I guess you have to ask for the good stuff,  Newbie mistake #1, the pita I got wasn't too bad though.  The Spanakopita wasn't all that it, tasted too \"green\" not enough flavor of feta, and by microwaving  it  the flaky crust became unflaky and jut soft and chewy, not good.  I ordered the Vegetarian Combo she ordered the Shawarma plate (see pics) My plate had babaganoush, falafel (hiding under the tomato salad) Tabbouleh and 2 stuffed grape leaves served with a side of yogurt / tatziki sauce.  I thought everything was really good and tasted pretty fresh except the grape leaves, they were atrocious, the rice inside was unrecognizable, it was so overcooked it completely turned to a mushy paste, bummer, grape leaves are my favorite. ( I will make them for us Andrea, I Promise)  I wish I had more of their falafel I pretty much filled up on the tatziki, babaganoush and pita. Now I know what to get next time.  So our waiter come over and says \"Since this is your first time, I'll take care of the bill, just take your ticket to the counter\"  WOW~ Are you serious, how generous!!  We wait in line, give our ticket to the guy and he keeps asking us to pay???  Well Apparently  there was a confusion of some sort, I don't know what the waiter meant by that, We though our lunch was going to be free.....it wasn't....but that's OK.  That's when I ordered my baklava, one piece.........I go to the car to eat it and went back in for 2 more pieces.....YUM!!  4 stars for the Baklava at least",

Of all the times I've been and all the people I've taken, I have never heard anything less than a 'wow, that was wonderful.'  Not only is the food reasonably priced, it comes in large portions in a timely manner. Just talking about it is making me crave it.    However, be warned that this place is more of a 'lunch with your friends' restaurant and less of a 'romantic date with your lover.'  While the food is delightful, the atmosphere is strange and, to be frank, slightly dirty.  From the market on the side, to the plastic glassware, to the aged chairs, this place is not much to look at.  So if you're looking for a tasty, affordable meal, Haji-Baba is a must.  If you're looking for the next hip spot, you may want to try somewhere with a little more flattering lighting.    Overall, the service is always wonderful, the food is absolutely worth it, but just know that Haji-Baba is not you're typical 5 star restaurant.",

My friend had gyro.  I took a small bite of the meat.  It may have been the best gyro ever!  I'll have to give a full one a try for myself someday.  The several types of baklava are delightful treat.  We went with cashew, pecan, and walnut.  All three were wonderful.  One big negative.  Only two pieces of pita came with our order of hummus.  Not even close to enough.  Make sure to order an extra (or two).  The hummus, like everything else, is fantastic.  The pita is pretty good, but nothing special by itself.

    "text": "I've been eating here since I first moved to Arizona in the '90s.  There was a time I worked nearby and had as many as 3 lunches a week here.  The quality has never varied.  This is also my daughter's favorite restaurant and the place she picked for her birthday dinner last week.  Gotta like that since they are so inexpensive.  The hummus and hand-made pitas are the best in town. Forget town.  They are the best I've ever had.  I'm speaking as someone who has eaten  his fair share of pitas, from Connecticut to NYC to CA and AZ.   YOU MUST REMEMBER TO ORDER THE HAND-MADE PITAS.  They cost a little extra (some like .25 if I remember correctly) but are worth every penny.  I can't even eat the non-handmade pitas after having them.  If you order a sandwich, make sure to request them.  You'll thank me later.   I've had pretty much every meatless item on the menu, and everything is good.  The vegetarian sampler plate is my usual choice, but the falafel sandwich and dolmas plate are also very good.  Make sure you order the hummus as an appetizer.  The lebni is also good but if you order both, you'll have leftovers.    I generally order way more handmade pitas than I need and take the leftovers home.   They also have a grocery selection, including olives and feta cheese.  I stocked up on baked giants beans in tomato sauce last week.  They are perfect with those pitas.    Go now, get the hummus and pitas, and yell me I'm wrong.   It is also the perfect place to take a group to lunch.  None of this asking for separate checks here.  You'll also never wait for a check.  They give you a slip after you order, you bring it up front and tell the cashier which items are yours.  Honor system.  Nice people, too.",

You can call ahead and pick up at the counter or just grab one of the tables to the right of where you walk in, if they are all occupied you just stand kind of by door (but not blocking it) and wait. Once a table leaves and you are up next an employee will run and clear off and wipe down the table and signal you over. I would call the service style at the tables \"fast paced table service\" which is totally fine, the server may not always be able to answer your questions but that has it's benefits as it might get you to take a chance and try something new.   That's what happened to me when I finally decided to try the Lamb Tongue Gyro, a decision that forever changed my life. I know a lot of you are thinking right now that it sounds gross, I mean lamb... tongue...? That's what most everyone thinks till they try it, it's amazing! The meat itself is so tender and juicy, the texture is closer to really tender grilled steak than anything else. The taste is somewhat similar to like dark meat chicken/turkey or maybe even duck just not quite as rich. It's hard to explain but that's why you just have to give it a shot. Plus, even though it's one of the most expensive things on their menu, it's still only like $6.50, and it's a full meal! This applies to basically everything else on their menu, chicken shawarma is another very popular dish that you can't go wrong with.   The building also doubles as a Middle Eastern deli/bakery/small grocery store. They has all kinds of cool products from the Middle East, tons of great spices, some amazing meats and pastries. Basically, it's got everything you could ever want and then some.  Believe the hype! There's a reason Haji's is considered a Tempe institution.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Based on the chicken schwarma plate and the lamb tongue pita, 5 stinkin stars.  Seating can suck when it's busy.  If you're over the age of 8, you have the capacity to be patient and handle it.  The lamb tongue is moist and well-seasoned and delicious.  The very first time I had it, I was thrown off by the pickle in the pita, but I like it there now.  A little tart acidity to balance the richness of the tongue meat.  I don't understand people's aversion to tongue.  Whether it's beef or lamb, its flavor is peerless and it can be one of the most tender cuts of meat.  This is one of the best chicken schwarma plates anywhere.  Every element on the plate, apart from being huge, is good.  More garlic sauce would be appreciated, but again, no real complaints.  (The pita, sometimes, is lacking.)  It is all well-seasoned, the chicken isn't overcooked, flavorful, with a nice and fresh tasting taboulleh - it hits the spot every time.    Even my wife, who does not really enjoy Middle Eastern food, enjoys this place.  That says a lot.",

The restaurant area is sparsely decorated but we don't mind.  Some of the best food comes from little hole-in-the-wall restaurants with little or no effort put into the decor.  The kabobs were not bad, they just weren't anything special.  The big disappointment was the rice.  It did not taste like basmati and did not have the saffron I'm used to seeing with rice when I order koubideh elsewhere.  There was a strange musty smell and taste to the rice that we just couldn't place.  We left most of the rice, and some of the kabob on the plate.  This would have been a two star experience if it hadn't been for the amazing selection of different types of baklava for sale in the little store.  That baklava was strictly 4 stars for both taste, texture, and freshness.  We bought one of each kind, pistachio baklava, almond baklava, every kind of baklava you can think of.  I highly recommend this little store for their baklava, I just wouldn't come back here to eat a meal.",

I love trying out new places and this Tempe location is not near my house, so I was only notified of it by a friend's recommendation.  It was a great tip.  The meal I chose was the Kabob Mixed Combination. This includes a skewer of kafta ground beef, a skewer of steak chunks, and a skewer of chicken. This is rounded off by a large serving of tibouli, big portions of hummus and slices of pita bread.  All the food was prepared right and served hot. The servers were kind, with a positive attitude. The restaurant is basically an add on set of tables to a small Arabic grocery store, both of which are well trafficked by patrons.    At the end if the meal, I picked up a couple of chocolate items from the store and happily paid the tab. The cost of the meals, while not cheap, was well worth the quantity and quality we recieved.  Everyone at our table was delighted with lunch and our experience at Haji-Baba.",

I liked that I could order meats as an added side so I could try anything. I'm sad there wasn't chicken schwarma ready but everything else we ordered was excellent! We got the two different kinds of beef kabob, beef schwarma, chicken kabob and gyro. I also go the Greek salad. This was a great keto friendly option! For those looking for low carb keto friendly middle eastern food. Just make sure to get salad instead of rice. I would definitely come again! We also got the hummus which was excellent.   The beef schwarma is different from what i am Use to. This one was more like shredded beef/pot roast.   Next time I'm going to try the chicken schwarma!",

Whatever you do, get here now and order the gyro or chicken shawerma plate. Do not pass go, do not collect $200, proceed immediately to Haji-Baba's.   We've been eating here for 22+ years...when we lived here and now, when we travel into town. We were just in town for a couple of days and came to eat dinner here twice. It's that tasty.   The home made feta cheese & fuls medames are amazing staters.  The lemonade is beyond delicious. Plus you can shop for your sweets and spices when you're done.   This place is magic.",

Every time I'm in town I make sure to stop by and get either a chicken shawarma plate or a chicken shawarma sandwich. Their chicken is very flavorful, juicy, and tender. I've also had the beef shawarma and it was juicy and tender as well! Very delicious no matter which meat you choose! Also, you get a lot for what you pay for. The plate comes with hummus, your choice of meat, tabouleh, white rice, and half a pita bread. It'll fill you up for sure.   This spot is very hole-in-the-wall. You don't expect it to be a restaurant especially because you walk in and half of it is a grocery store. But the food is one of the best! Try the rose water lemonade, kinda on the sweeter side but still very good.   You can also do some side shopping of the European imported candy and chocolates.",

Though I've never actually eaten in, I usually call in my order and pick it up on my way home from work. The location is in a strip mall off of Apache--though it may not look like much, I've had great food in that strip mall. I'm usually not there during super busy times, but the parking does seem to be pretty limited.   My go-to order is the chicken shawarma plate. Don't even bother with anything else (to be honest, I'm sure it is all absolutely delicious). I'm not sure about in-restaurant portions, but as far as the to-go order is concerned, it's enough food to last me at least 2 meals. Piled high with basmati rice, hummus, tabouli, pita bread, garlic sauce, and an extremely generous helping of chicken shawarma, it's a nearly unbelievable amount of food for ~$10. An unbelievable amount of GREAT food! Everything is seasoned perfectly so that nothing overwhelms anything else. I feel fine about hummus usually, but they have such tasty hummus that my first move is to gobble all of it down with pita. Best bet though? Make the \"perfect bite\" every time. You know what I mean. A lil bit of each thing on your fork, so you're getting the full delicious flavor experience.   Seriously, do not sleep on Haji. It's the best around.",

You can sit down in the restaurant or take food to go. And be sure to stock up on your favorite groceries - roasted sesame seeds, rose water, dried fruit - while you are there!",

In the vegetarian platter, The baba ghanoush and the tzatitki are amazing, hummus is good and the falafel and dolmades are decent. This is not an upscale place with great ambience but an average looking place with decent service. Most of the times the service is pretty fast although they are very busy every time we go no matter what time you go. You would normally get a place in 5-10mins.",

I subbed the \"yogurt salad\" for regular salad (the dressing that came with it was yogurt tho )  My group got 3 meals, 3 drinks and 2 desserts and it was only $36! Really great pricing. The rise water lemonade was particularly yummy. The hummus was one of the better hummus I've had! Our waiter was super friendly as well. The food came out nice and fast, but they did t kind that we lingered.   There is a grocery store in the restaurant with really authentic food items. So it's fun to browse before or after your meal and take something home you've never cooked with before!",

You can't go wrong with this and It comes with so much food including rice, to-die-for hummus, a pita and tabouli all yummy and at excellent value too.  The ambiance is nothing to write home about, that is why I take away one star. Part of it is a grocery store with some really great ingredientes you can't find anywhere else, which is cool but can be awkward if you are trying to order take out and someone is checking out their grocery cart full of items in front of you. The food and price more than make up for the lacking ambiance.",

I always want to be wowed when I go to a restaurant. Nothing is more of a let down than mediocrity during the sacred dining hour.   In a nutshell, it's a neat little place and our service was very good. Nothing was horrible. Appetizer was quite tasty, but the pita was flimsy and had no taste to it. Entree was OK, but the little bubble gum size, chewy chicken is disgraceful. Not appetizing at all, pushed it all to the side.  Arabic (or Turkish) coffee was good, but done too quickly. It's supposed to slowly rise to the top 3 times before being served. I know, you're busy and it's a pain in the ass, but that's how it's done, and tastes much better when cooked properly. Also should have had more cardamom and sugar, but that's probably just my personal taste.",

    "text": "DROOL.   Every time I want Middle Eastern food (and I am today but Seattle sucks for such thing thus far)....I think of Haji Baba. Introduced to me as one of the first restaurants I ate at when I was a freshman at ASU (wow that was 6 years ago-- I'm old).   What I miss most is the chicken shawarma plate that I would order with salad instead of tabooli and hummus (no offense to tabooli-- it's great here but I'm not a fan). Their hummus is good because it is made with the right ingredients and it's simple. Hummus should be kept simple.  The shawarma garlic sauce with the sririacha-- is a True delight.    What else is good: EVERYTHING! Falafel, gyro, shawarama salad, all their appetizers. Their lemonade is homemade and not too sweet. It has a weird flavor that gives it a \" what is this?\" appeal. Also in AZ when it's hot, drinks = must because the water sucks.   Don't  forget to get a baklava. They have like 6 or 7 diff varieties and they are all delicious. You can also check out their small market which is a part of the restaurant and has a wide variety of middle eastern random goods and spices.   Big portions (I always had lots of leftovers), cheap food and a simple approach. I MISS YOU HAJI BABA and I promise I will go back to you every time I visit.",

    "text": "Why didn't I know about this place? I guess my friend Sarah has been hounding me to go here for years, but tonight was my first visit. Where's my time machine so I can go back and eat here more.  I was torn whether to give it a 4 or a 5... The decor is an afterthought - in fact, the restaurant part of it seems to be tacked on to an international foods market. The market side has some amazing foods you won't find in many other places around the Valley - definitely worth going out of your way to check out.   There were 3 of us, and we grabbed a table and sat down. It didn't take long to decide what we wanted - turns out we just about wanted a little bit of everything. The prices on the menu looked like they were from another time. I thought they gave us the old menus by accident. Let me put it this way - the prices were so low, I questioned the quality of the food I was about to eat...   We placed our order, and within a few minutes our table was filled with plates of beautiful food. This was as troubling as the prices - fast food prices and fast food service usually mean fast food and subsequent ring sting. Well, this is not the case. The food here was fantastic. I would say the food is a solid 4. It's not the best example of gyros and hummus etc that I've had, but it ranked quite high. It was delicious and flavorful, and everything seemed to be really fresh.   I cleaned my plate and picked at just about everything - we all shared a bit. Every mouthful was a treat. The service was more fast and efficient than it was friendly, but I never felt unwelcome. In a place like this, I'd rather have a no bullshit sort of experience. Just get this food into my bloodstream as expediently as possible. Really though, the service was plenty nice.   After we finished eating, we wandered around the market side and shopped a bit. We wanted to take so many things home with us - teas, sweets, spices, honey, and assorted unique items... We're definitely going back.   This is a divey hole-in-the-wall that deserves all the praise it is getting. If it turns out to be as reliable and consistent as I've heard it is, we're going to be regulars. If you twisted my arm to complain, I would say it is pretty inconveniently located (or extra convenient depending on from where and how you get there) - I just find it a bit of a pain in the ass trying to drive around and make turns on Apache since the Light Rail went live.   I can tell you this - if you're thinking of eating at Pita Jungle down the street - give this a shot instead. I still love Pita Jungle, but this wins on price and speed, ties on deliciousness, and only loses on decor. It's not a first date spot - it's more of a 4th date spot... impress her with the awesome and interesting eclectic hole in the wall joint.",

I ordered the stuffed grape leaves that also comes with toubouli, hummus, and pita bread. It was so filling! The toubouli was made just right.  We ate in the actual restaurant, and the service was quick and the wait staff were polite and helpful (rather, sometimes they are polite and helpful depending...).  My friend ordered the Gyro with lamb and beef and said it was fantastic. The meat has slightly crispy edges with perfect spicy flavoring, based on what he had said.  We ordered baklava to go, and I'll definitely be back for more.  Apparently they don't make it there, but we still like it.   The grocery store has some unique spices that are sometimes hard to find at regular grocery stores. There's also a take-out option.  However, I am not a regular and don't know any of the staff, so they weren't that nice when I was buying some groceries. Plus I am quite sure they overcharged me on the grapes. There was some discussion on price as two of the employees looked at me with frowning faces. What is that about?",

And if you can control yourself form doing that you walk by any aisle of goodies ranging from crackers and cookies to delectable chocolates you can't easily find anywhere else. If you are not sitting down to eat and just getting something to take home you will arrive at the baklava counter to order with just as many dessert in the case as on top. The sandwiches are a great grab and go lunch that will have you craving more for dinner. As for dine in you can't go wrong with trying any of the plates.

Hands down, it is the BEST middle eastern food around and the prices can't be beat.  We moved to Utah about 10 years ago and searched for food that was as tasty as it is here.  At the end of the meal, we would say, \"well, it was okay, but it's no Haji Baba.\"  When we decided to move back to Arizona, the first place we went for lunch out was Haji Baba!  It continues to be delicious.  I also love the market that is inside.  I buy all of my feta here as well as greek olives.  They have awesome prices on the feta and olives as well as spices that can be hard to find elsewhere.    There are several things worthy of complaining about, but the food is so good that it makes it all worth it.  This place is very popular, which makes it difficult to find a table during peak times.  Lunch is crazy busy!  The service in the restaurant leaves something to be desired.  It's pretty bare bones and definitely not at all like the nice chain greek restaurants (think My Big Fat Greek....)  We no longer eat in the restaurant, we now go for take out.  This place does a huge amount of take out so call your order in ahead of time.  Great food, good portion sizes, great prices.  I don't know why we keep trying different middle eastern food restaurants, it's Haji Baba's gyros that we always wish we had eaten instead!  Nothing is better!",

Don't get me wrong, when food is just \"okay\", it's not \"bad\", it's not \"awful\", but it's certainly not \"great\". I tried the hummus and chicken schwarma and there was nothing about either that made it significantly better than the next Middle Eastern joint in Tempe. To top it off, some of the younger staff members are rude and full of themselves and that is pretty irritating. The food was all presented well but there were some things on the plate that were a bit questionable.  I do like the attached shop. This is very traditional for Middle Eastern restaurants. It was nice to take a stroll up and down the aisles after our meal.  All in all, decent.",

The location may be hard to find if you're not looking for it.  Half of the establishment is the actual cafe and the other half is like a mini mart for all things Middle Eastern.  When I have some time to spare I'll sit down and eat at the cafe and the waiter is always very polite. Most of the time though I just grab take out which is very convenient.  It never takes more than 10 minutes to get my food.    Overall, I would highly suggest eating at Haji Baba if you love authentic Middle Eastern food and don't want to spend much money.",

    "text": "I am conflicted.  Haji-Baba, as a restaurant, has some five star strengths and some one star weaknesses.  The strengths: very large portions of food, all of which are appealing even to people who are not familiar with middle eastern cuisine; low prices; an ethnic grocery attached which is a pleasant diversion while you are waiting for your food.    The weaknesses: virtually everything is underspiced, so you get tired of it after two or three bytes.  Apparently, lemon and garlic are spices-non-grata in this kitchen, and even salt and pepper are used sparingly.  For $2.60 you get enough hummous for two, as an appetiser, but you won't want to finish it.  It reminds me a lot of paste.  And the pita (bread) was going stale. Exceptions: their take on a meat-stuffed eggroll, and, believe it or not, the gyros.  Also well-spiced: a variety of sauces which helps offset the blandness of the food.  I must also comment on the tabouleh (which here means ground parsley) served as a huge mound on most plates; it would feed a baseball team, but it, too, is tasteless.  Other, much smaller, issues: it can get crowded, the ambiance does not exist, and they have an odd system for paying your check which puts you in a line with the people buying groceries and can be slow.  Hints: 1.  Order the Combination plate.  For $12 it is definitely enough for two average appetites and you don't get bored so easily.   2.  They have a large grocery using the same name 3/4 mile east. The restaurant is a smaller place hidden away in a strip mall.",

The restaurant section is pretty small and the decor is a bit old but the food is really good and quick. It's never too spicy and is always hot and fresh. My favorite is the chicken shawarma. The only draw back is everytime I've order a Sprite, I get water. I'm not sure if the waiters aren't paying attention or what but it happens all the time.  That being said for something different I highly recommend Haji-Baba. The portions are rather large so if you're dieting I'd suggest splitting the meal with someone or going there for a cheat day!",

The other day, we were too late stopping by another middle eastern restaurant as we had only an hour left until our show at Gammage played. We knew we wanted to sit down and eat, but were trying to figure out a place that would serve us, bill us, and send us on our way (in the most efficient and NICEST way possible). Haji's was it. It has been the EXACT same recipe since 2005 and if it ever changed I'd cry. It is THIS EXACT shawarma that made me attempt to remake it for my parents in DC. VERY TASTY, but nothing will ever be good as the original. I hope they know how much of an institution they are. LOVE!!!",

The Gyros Plate totaled to $7.49 and the Gyros Sandwich was only $3.69. Splitting the Gyros Plate is a fantastic idea since the portions are huge enough to feed two people. What I absolutely love about the place is the lamb was so soft and tender. The plate also came with the salad with a unique dressing--It was the first thing I gobbled down! Adding siracha gives the food an extra kick, but its not necessary to add since each bite is so savory! The hummus was A-OK, and I would suggest passing on that.  Overall, the place has slightly loud Middle Eastern music in the background, great service, and great food (most important).",

I thought the quantity of lamb on my plate was really less (one small skewer) with lots of rice, salad , one burnt piece of tomato and bell pepper. Plus the dish itself was really dry overall..the taste of the lamb itself was just about average..nothing to rave about. My husband's sandwich was also..well..mehh..very dry, loaded with lettuce and the sandwich bread was not tasty. thing is, we just moved to Arizona from California and the quality of middle eastern food in California is really good and maybe that's why we were disappointed with this place.

Yes I know there are places to get baklava around Phx but they were either too soggy, too sweet, too sugary, too stale, etc. Something was always wrong. But this place is definitely a diamond in the rough. They have a basic selection of middle eastern food like the sherwarma and the kabobs, which are all very tasty and well prepared and much cheaper than the Persian Room (I'm not the biggest fan of the Persian Room bc its just not worth the drive and money unless you are on a date and trying to impress someone). They also have a great selection of baklava like almond, pistachio, cashew, walnut, and the princess which is think is a combination of all the nuts. Regardless of what you get, you will be happy (both mouth and wallet).   The downside is that since it is in a grocery store, its a bit crowded and sometimes the wait can be a bit long, but I don't really mind the wait bc I know everything is fresh and prepared when ordered.",

    "text": "My favorite place to grab a gyro or Shawarma plate in Tempe. The food is very reasonably priced and you get served relatively quickly.   I have had pretty much everything on the menu and there is only one item that I do not recommend. I am a bit of an adventurous eater so last time I was there I decided to try to the lamb's tongue.  I am a fan of beef tongue I think under different circumstances I would enjoy Lamb's tongue but the texture was quite gristley and they flavored the tongue with an inordinate amount of lemon.   There was lemon in everything, the lambs tongue, the rice, and the salad. To make matters worse I ordered a lemonade I could not avoid that damn lemon!   Despite not enjoying the lamb's tongue everything else is quite delicious. The baklava is spot on!",

I liked the thing that looked like egg roll and the thing that looked like hush puppies..  Wasn't a huge fan of the thing that looked like dark corn bread and the salad type couscous thing.  The chicken kabob, koobideh and beef kabobs were not very flavorful and slightly burned.  LOVED the pistachio baklavas!  Which is why I'm giving it 4 stars..  :)",

We had the koubeh and kibbedeh plates, along with sides of foul, falafel, a yogurt soda and two orders of baklava to go for the amazingly small sum of $27.  How are you going to beat that ?   Due to the unexpectedly huge portion sizes, we ended up taking most of it home.  Everything was delicious and the service was very fast even though it was packed.

I also ordered the hummus, which was $2.50 - not worth it in my opinion. I think the flavored hummus at grocery stores taste better and it'll be less expensive too. Haji-Baba is definitely a hole in the wall, with little fruit flies and flies buzzing around, but the taste is great, and the price is fair.  Note: If you want to eat at the restaurant, just have a seat at any table on the right hand side and a waiter will come with menus and take your order. If you want to take it to go, then go straight to the register and they'll take care of you.  After you finish eating at the restaurant, bring that little receipt stub left at your table to the cash register, and they'll ring you up. :)",

I order the gyro platter.The plate is huge and comes with a huge salad, large amount of rice and gyro meat.  I couldn't get enough of the rice. This is my second favorite rice after Moby Dick (east cost) My only complaint is you receive only a small ll piece of flat bread to go with the meal.  I also appreciate the large water glass and not a small glass that requires several refills over the course of a meal.  Payment is done at the market register.  You receive excellent value for what you pay for. A meal for two will cost about $15 (or less)   I will be going back to this place again and again!",

I just barely moved to Phoenix, but before I moved here I made it a priority to come eat here every time I was here.   First of all, it's super affordable. For two people you can get sandwiches whether it be a gyro or a shawarma or whatever, plus a side of hummus or falafel or whatever for well under 15 bucks. The food isn't just cheap, it's also delicious. I've tried a lot of different things and it's all pretty authentic.   The only reason it doesn't get 5 stars is the seating of the restaurant. It's always packed in there and there is never room. But it's delicious.",

Ok, it may not have been the sole determining factor, but once you try the food here, you will quickly understand that it honestly COULD have been!  I partook of the cuisine of three different Middle Eastern restaurants in the last month and none of them can even compare to Haji-Baba.  The chicken here is tender, moist, and well-flavored. The tahini sauce for the chicken must contain crack because it is utterly addicting and a little goes a long way. The pita is soft and light--a perfect dipping tool for the smooth and creamy hummus.  There are not enough words in any language to describe the oral ecstasy you will discover here at Haji-Baba so do yourself a favor and get in here now!",

I'm just being quirky and silly.  Nice menu with all the usual goodies you find in most Middle Eastern restaurants.  One of had the Chicken Shawma plate with pita bread, tabouli, and plain white rice. I had the Gyro Platter and was with a salad, pita bread, and plain white rice.  A little boring.  The gyro meat was a bit dry.  I have to say they have huge portions.  The restaurant is combined with a market and browsing through some of the foods of Middle Eastern groceries.  Very nice.  Prices are fair.  Service was very very slow.  We also got the egg roll with had meat, onions and nice flavorings.  Very tasty.",

There were flies on the table.   My 4star goes completely for the food served. We had Chicken kabab for appetizers which was juicy and rightly cooked. Had chicken shawarma plates which was the best part of the lunch. Garlic sauce kept us wanting more. We had tamarina juice for drinks which was really refreshing. We ended the meal with Walnut Baklava, given that there was hardly any other option. Anyways it was worth it. Had a wonderful lunch.   In the end the price is reasonable and though the service was a bit slow but was up to the mark.  I would definitely recommend the food. It stands out the best.",

But I've been to Haji Baba a couple times now and have not only found things on the menu I can identify, I found things that are really good!  1. their hummus is really good and their pitas are nice and fresh. 2. the chicken shwarma is also really good, flavorful without being weird. 3. I've never been a big falafel fan, at most places it seems really dry to me, but theirs is not dry, yet not greasy, has a good flavor and is complimented nicely with the tahini sauce.  On my last visit I ordered the falafel (three balls) and a side of rice. They gave me a huge plate of rice, more than I could eat. Between that and the falafel I was full and satisfied.   And like everyone else says, it's cheap, which is always a bonus.",

The hummus, babaganoush, gyros,  feta (of various varieties) are all great.  The falafel isn't great -- dense & tough without a huge amount of flavor.  My mother refers to the service as like the Soup Nazi in Seinfeld... don't ask for any favors.  For instance, we went on Sunday at 4:30pm,  Yelp says open until 5pm, the door says open until 5pm.  We went to the counter and they say  \"sorry we close at 4:30\" (we were there at 4:32).  Out of the \"goodness\" of their hearts, they give us salad and falafel and hummus but nothing else.  Anyways, the food would get 4* the service gets a 1*.   I'll be generous and give 3*.",

There are hispanic men in the back cooking the meals, and the employees are of middle eastern descent. I don't think I've ever had to wait for a table at Haji Baba's, and the meals come out quick and they're still hot.  The pita is one thing, but I feel the rest of the meal lacks luster. The lentils are just \"ok\" and the rice serves the same. Something dull about the flavor. Maybe I'm too american for their own good.  The hours of operation at this place are extremely weird. If you go on Sunday I believe, it's closed. It also closes early on the week days. But they are good for pick up if you want to order in.  This is another one of those \"you get a lot for your money\" places.  It's worth the trip, but don't expect fireworks.",

I always order the chicken kabob with tabouli instead of their regular green salad; their hummus is killer.    The restaurant is half-grocery store and half restaurant (well, more like 1/3 restaurant and 2/3 store), and you can get everything from henna and dry lentils and spices to fresh feta, freshly-baked pita and DVDs.

I don't understand all the fuss about this place, kind of like Fez where everyone raves about it and I just don't get it, so maybe it is me.   There is no atmosphere to speak of, what so ever, not that its a bad thing. The place is sectioned off into two portions, one a dining area, and one a grocery store. We were seated at one of the tables in the grocery store, like.... IN the grocery store. No complaints here, I find something oddly comforting about eating in a place like this.  The food was good, hummus though was very good. We had a nice array of salads, gyros, shwarmas, hummus, spanikopita, baklava, etc. All sorts of shit was at the table, and it was all good, but none of it made me go oh man this is the best I've ever had.   I'd return for two reasons, one is the price. Dinner for 4 with more than we could eat was less than $30. reason two is the great service. We didn't more than 5 minutes for ANYthing.

I gave it four stars because it's not the prettiest atmosphere, it's on the side of a grocery store, but I'm totally a fan of dives so I didn't care.  Also they charge 50 cents for refills on your soda, but the food prices are cheap for what you get so that doesn't matter too much. I ordered the chicken shawerma platter and is was amazing. Lots of food for what you pay for, and a literal MOUNTAIN of tabooli on the side. Yum! After you eat your dinner, remember to get Baklava on your way out.  It is the bomb!",

    "text": "I can understand why this restaurant is a hit with the ASU crowd: its proximity to campus, accessibility by light rail, low prices. The hummus appetizer alone, a generous serving at less than 3 bucks with hot pita halves, could be a heavy snack or a light meal. The very inexpensive sandwiches vary in quality: I found the falafel to be really good, the koubideh was OK, and the beef shawarma was dry and lacking in flavor. The tabouleh was a bit too acidic for my taste and would probably have been better if more bulgur were added.  Waiting time at dinner depends on the size of your group. When I came with a larger group, we had a long wait, but seating was prompt when I came with just 2 friends. Overall, my dining experiences here were OK. For food quality, I consider the nearby Cafe Istanbul to be a better choice; but for price, this is the place to go.",

I went for a late lunch, and had no problem being seated. Service was good, and the atmosphere was friendly. I ordered the chicken shawarma plate with hummus, tabouli and garlic sauce.   The food portions were huge. The hummus was good, but a bit too salty. The chicken shawarma was nicely seasoned in general, but was all dark meat, which I don't care for. Also, the garlic sauce was more like garlic mayonnaise, which I also dislike. I came prepared for the more traditional blend of garlic, lemon juice and olive oil which is generally served at my favorite Lebanese restaurant in Minneapolis.  All in all, I was let down by my meal. I will however be returning to the market again soon.",

    "text": "This is very good Middle Eastern food. Not as good as the best I've ever had in New York City but definitely well above average and better than Pita Jungle! Pitas tasted as they should, falafel and meats were moist and flavorful and the Arabic coffee was the perfect sweet dessert all by itself. They could add a few little extras to spice up their sandwiches like tomatoes and onions. I asked for some extra tahini and they quickly brought me a cup at no extra charge. I like that!  They seem a bit understaffed with employees going back and forth between the restaurant and the connected grocery store, so getting a waiter's attention can take a few minutes. Despite this, the service was okay. They don't tell you, but they won't give you a check...only a stub that you're supposed to take to the cashier yourself. It's laid back in that way, which is kind of nice. I only wish they had a napkin dispenser or a paper towel roll at the table because this kind of food uses up paper napkins fast and one is far from enough! I'm a tough restaurant critic and I will definitely be back!  Btw, you have to drive slow on Apache to find this place because if you blink, you'll miss it! It is directly across the street from Tempe Fire Engine #1.",

We sat at a table for about 15 minutes with no waiter to even take a drink order. We decided to order to go thinking it would be faster since the table service was so slow. We waited HOUR after ordering our food. I finally asked how much longer only to find that they hadn't started the order. We were there an hour and a half total between all the waiting in line and waiting for food.   If that wasn't bad enough, when we got home my husband and I BOTH found SEVERAL HAIRS in our food. Gross!! Thinking back some of the cooks had no hair cover.   Honestly, the food looked pretty good, so if you don't mind waiting over an hour for your food and getting some bonus hairs from the kitchen then you might like this place. I will not be returning and would recommend to stay away. There are plenty of other good restaurants in the area",

We've been there as a party of two and also accompanied by about 10 more.  Always good food and friendly service.  I put a couple glops of mild chili pepper paste in my tortilla soup, it makes all the difference (use half malt-liquor, half chicken stock for the base), add roasted poblanos in adobo sauce (1 chile and one teaspoon of sauce is good for us), and fry some thinly sliced pasilla or anaheim peppers in the chicken fat rendered from the skins removed from the chicken thighs that you'll later shred and add back to the broth.  Why did I add this (partial) recipe? To show that Haji Baba's grocery has ingredients I find indispensable in all sorts of dishes.  There are plenty of other examples.  So have dinner, and do a little shopping.  Enjoy!",

As for desert I didn't have any tonight.  In the past I have had the walnut baklava and it is great.     The prices here are very reasonable and the portions are huge.

I was very skeptical about this place, but I read yelp review and figure what can it go wrong.... Right?  Well, waited 40 mins to get my food, because they forgot my order.  Chicken was burnt.  I mean it was so black, I thought I was eating a charcoal.  I made small compliant to them, they offered to give me $3 off the tab..  I would of been more pleased if they remade my food, but they were closing.  So $3 off the tab was the only option they given me..  Salad was decent.  Fresh and great dressing.  Hummus was decent.  Little salty and sour compared to others.   Rice was okay, nothing special.    Food was about average to me.  I had a better experience eating at \"Greek wrap\" on bell road.    I don't think I will be returning to this place after the experience I've encountered.  It is not worth of waiting 15 mins for seating, getting over cooked food, and not getting my order for 40 mins.    Maybe next time, they will get my order correct, however, it is not worth the trip for average food..",

There were an array of items ordered at the table; I got the chicken shawarma plate & others had gotten the combination plate (vegetarian & non-vegetarian), the chicken kabobs, etc.  As far as my dish goes, I thought the quality and quantity was spot on. The chicken was tender and delicious; it went really well with the rice and the garlic sauce was a good addition but I didn't find it to be necessary (which is not how it is at some other restaurants). I'm not a huge fan of tabouli but I liked how they had made it here, it didn't have an over-powering taste. I'm very critical of hummus typically and I enjoyed this one. It wasn't lemon-y and tasted so good with the pita. I snagged a couple of bites from my friends combination plate and I thought everything from that also tasted good.  As I said before - the quality and quantity was good, as was the price so I'd definitely return.",

The employees are nice and it's a no frills kinda place--really casual environment right in Tempe. But wow, the food was terrible. And I'm not just basing this off just one dish. Firstly, it was not authentic tasting at all. I assume the good reviews stem from those who don't know what real Middle Eastern food tastes like. Secondly, the tabouli tastes like the packaged kind you can buy at any other middle eastern market....it ain't good. The kefta was not kefta. TBH, I'm not sure what it was. So maybe the other dishes are not bad but deff don't expect anything edible out of any of the meat dishes.",

    "text": "Solid middle eastern food espcially for phoenix/tempe. Its basically a restaurant in a grocery store. We walked in around lunchtime on a Sunday and were seated fairly promptly. I had the Chicken Swarma Plate and my brother had the baba ghanoosh and a chicken wrap. Prices are very reasonable our bill combined was 24 bucks. The place was pretty busy to which is always a good sign for a random 'hole in the wall' restaurant.  As for the actual meal, as you can see in my attached picture the portions were very large. Plenty of chicken rice garlic sauce etc.  Chicken was succulent and the 'arabic bread' they included was nice.  I've had better in LA and Detroit but all in all an above average meal esp for the price. Also when u pay u walk up to the cashier  and pay which I prefer. The whole place has a family run business vibe too it.",

    "text": "I was questioning whether I should leave a review for a restaurant that has over 500 reviews averaging close to 5 stars.  But that super meal I had at Haji-Baba warrants a review.  Although a distance from my house, I wanted to give this place a try because of the legendary number of positive reviews.  Sure, they have a few unsatisfied customers but their reviews are mostly due to wait time for service.  They do get super crowded so frustration is to be expected.  Now for the REAL DEAL   Service was quick despite it being crowded on a Saturday night.  We were served by the twins---both handsome, both courteous and both efficient.   We had the lamb combination, a side order of Kibbe and the vegetarian platter.  They agreed to substitute hummus for the grape leaves which I haven't learned to love yet.  The lamb platter came with a skewer of wonderfully charred, generously thick chunks of expertly done lamb, a roasted tomato, lettuce and perfectly cooked basmati rice.  Looked amazing and was amazing. The kibbe was baked (sometimes they are fried), stuffed with beef and pine nuts.  Despite being baked, there was not a hint of dryness.  It had cinnamon in it which is not my preference but hubby thought it was delightful and took care of making it disappear.    The vegetable platter consisted of babaganoush, tabouli, falafel, hummus, yogurt and a salad.   I sprinkled it with Sumak to further enhance the flavors and it was really a delicious dish.  Both dishes were accompanied by plenty of arabic bread or pita.   Our food was truly enjoyable.  Nothing like a great meal that doesn't disappoint.",

My ACIM/Unity minister Julianne Lewis used to eat here once a week in the late 90's, with whoever wanted to join her.    I ate here most recently a month ago with a lunch bunch MeetUp.  I paid $12 for the lamb kabob. I asked for the kabobs to be grilled RED on the inside.  Server said OK, but when the kabobs came 9and there were only 5 one inch cubes or so, I wish there were more for the $12, some were well-done, kinda hard and dry, not even pink inside.  Some were pink but none were red on inside.  I told the server but he said \"that's the way we make them, we grill them all the same.  If we made them rare, people can't chew them\".  Well I don't mean THAT raw, but I find anything cooked longer than red on the inside, makes it kinda tough.  Even lamb.  Taste was just A -OK, but I could smell the charbroil.  Years ago, I ordered the lamb tongue sandwich.  It turned out to be whole lamb tongue all hanging out of the bread and wagging and lollying at you !!!  Kinda gross to bite down on the whole tongues and shut them up, but someone ordered the lamb tongue this most recent visit and the tongue was sliced.  So I guess they had to tone down the tongues for us Whitey-Gringos, tho I am Chinese and have no problem eating fish with the heads attached.    I prefer going to Khyber Halal at 24th St and Indian School for this type of food, grilled lamb, sharwarma, etc.",

The feel is super casual, affordable & food is delicious! We will definitely be coming back again. Not seen here is a Falafil wrap and a Shish wrap, both very filling and delicious.

But the restaurant portion is actually quite large and is pretty closed off from the rest of the store. The servers were super nice and gave us great recommendations, and the food came out in less than 5 minutes once we had ordered.   The platters are delicious and the portions are HUGE for only $8.99 - definitely had enough leftovers for a whole other meal. I got the gyro plate, which comes with gyro meat, pita, salad, and rice. The meat by itself is slightly salty but everything combined tastes amazing. The dressing on the salad was also pretty unique. My friends got the chicken shawarma plate, which comes with chicken, pita, hummus, tabouli, and rice, and loved it as well. Their only critique was that the garlic sauce was a bit strong, so avoid if you don't like garlic.  Note: when you're done, you can take the receipt/bill up to the main grocery store check-out. We sat around for like 20 minutes before we realized we were supposed to go up and pay lol.",

    "text": "The absolute best. My family has been coming to Haji Baba for over 30 years. And I'm gonna keep the tradition going. If any meal I could have on a weekly basis it would be at Haji with the chicken shawarma plate.   Small place but they turn tables fast. The food is always good and consistent.   The grocery store is on point too. If you need spices they are 10 times cheaper than anything you will get in the major grocery chains of the same stuff.   They serve Pepsi and not coke it's refreshing. They always have bottles of sriracha hot sauce on tap and goes well with the food. Again this is a must have on a regular basis.   If you can get in at 11-1130 for lunch right before the rush hits you will be glad you did. Again, they do turn tables fast but it's nice to beat the rush. Always will be back without question.",

    "text": "Recently I received word that my favorite Middle Eastern restaurant Alladin's Kitchen closed its doors. This was, at least for me, the best place to get your Mediterranean fix including some of the tastiest stuffed grape leaves around. I can go on and on about how much I loved Alladin's but alas, I have to pick myself up and rise above this terrible loss.   When a door closes a window opens and that window lead me right into the kitchen of Haji Baba. Situated along Apache Blvd in Tempe this spot is half restaurant and half Middle Eastern market and bakery, talk about a one stop shop. Upon entering, please feel free to seat yourself. On my visit there were menus already at each empty table.   Scanning the menu the first thing I noticed was the Abali Yogurt Soda ($1.69). Having never tried this I was quick to get a glass full though the waiter seemed hesitant to bring it. Let's just say after the first sip yogurt soda is an acquired taste. While I liked the yogurt sourness the saltiness of the soda was way too much. Fortunately the waiter was observant and brought over a glass of iced water by his own accord. I have to tell you that the service here is attentive and friendly.   The occasional juvenile in me snickered when I read the first item on the menu, Homos Tahini ($2.29), how appropriate. Joking aside, this was a beautiful puree of chickpeas, tahini or sesame seed paste, lemon juice and garlic. Usually this is served super garlicky elsewhere I was delighted to find this version to be well balanced and flavorful. Getting the same treatment as the homos, the Babaghanooj ($2.99) contains roasted eggplant instead of chickpeas. Both were dressed with olive oil and adorned with pickles and olives, were wishing for a glass of wine to compliment the appetizers, but they serve no liquor here.  Made from a mixture of fava beans and chickpeas, then pressed into patties and deep fried, the filling of the Falafil Sandwich ($2.69) was crunchy on the outside, creamy on the inside. The warm pita bread and the fresh lettuce and tomato made for really good eats, a must.  Kabob Koubideh ($7.49) sounds like quite a mouthful and let me tell you this, it was. Pounded ground meat marinated in onion juice, and then grilled to a juicy smoky excellence. The meat reminded me of a Middle Eastern take on chopped steak, sublimely tender. Along side was a huge pile of super light basmati rice, fresh hot pita and creamy yogurt salad. A sprinkling of sumac over the entire plate adds a slight sourness, which melds incredibly well with this type of food.   Desserts are pretty much limited to Baklava ($1.29), but after such an amazing meal it was a real surprise that the sweet ending was a real disappointment. The nuts in each all tasted old with a slightly bitter rancidity to them. Selections ranged from pistachio, cashew and walnut with the later being the best, using the word \"best\" loosely.   With meager prices, generous portions and outstanding service, Haji Baba will definitely begin to fill the void in my heart and my tummy.",

The garlic sauce that they use is really good and compliments the rice and chicken so well. My favorite would have to be their sandwiches as it was just perfect.  They do have a small grocery inside as well which is certainly very convenient combined with the restaurant.",

I don't feel it is the cleanest place, but I have eaten here over 20 times and have never gotten sick.  It is a small restaurant inside a small grocery store.  Even though it is a small restaurant, I have never had to wait more than 20 minutes.  Be careful to not miss it in the plaza as it is very small and it's almost difficult to find in the plaza, but it's there.  I love eating two things here, any of the sandwiches (especially the gyro) and the hummus with pita.  It is extremely delicious!  My friends like getting the full meal dishes, and any of them are very good.

I only eat two things here: Gyros Plate and Chicken Shawarma Plate. I usually order a combination of both so my husband can take the shawarma and of course the gyros is mine.   Since I get too busy to stop by, I always buy their gyros meat, which is sold by the pound. Then, I also order their tzatziki sauce and their house dressing for the salad. I haven't found a recipe to match this food, but the food is like my \"comfort food\". I took my kids here and they love it too!   The place has never changed since the first time I came in. The only things that were changed were the prices. Even so, it's still worth it.",

    "text": "First off, let me preface this review by saying that I've eaten here a few times in the past and it was mainly a pleasant experience.  I arrived at the restaurant at 11 am on Sunday, the hours clearly written on the door saying that that was the time they opened.  As I waited to be seated, an employee came up to me and said the kitchen would not be opening until 11:30.  No \"I'm sorry for the inconvenience\", no \"I apologize for the wait\", just so matter-of-fact, \"we don't give a crap about you\" attitude that I almost walked out right then and there.  But I brushed it off and gave them another chance.  After waiting for the half hour, I see the employee cleaning the tables and placing menus upon them.  He notices a fly on the window, promptly kills the fly with the menu, and proceeds to place the menu back on the table, dead fly and all.  Very sanitary, well done.  I still waited to be seated after witnessing this, unbelievably.  Finally get seated, was obviously the first one in the place, and this same employee proceeds to take some other customers order before me.  That was the last straw, I was out of there.  NOTE TO STAFF AT HAJI BABA:  I am a paying customer, do not ever act like I am doing you a favor by visiting your establishment.  You provide a service and I choose whether or not to give you my business.  Needless to say, I will never be back to your restaurant, and can only hope that you'll start appreciating the already established customer base that you've somehow held onto.",

Slightly medium rare and not a trace of fat or gristle, perfectly seasoned and melt in my mouth tender. I could have done with a little less rice and a little more pita, but I couldn't have asked for more flavor. We started with the kibbee and sanbusek as appetizers. Both were delightful. I also decided to try the Arabic-style coffee (yum!) and baklava (so many kinds to choose from!) for desert. It couldn't have been more delicious :)  The service was positively perfect, unobtrusive, but we didn't wait for anything, and he never made us feel rushed, even though we were the last people in there.

I will certainly be back to eat here!  The store area is quite amazing, too!  When I need spices of ANY kind, this is where I'm going!

    "text": "If you are reading this today is your lucky day! Truly. I am an on again off again food snob. Maybe reformed. But no.  I'm so sorry to do this. I wanted this place to be the Gem that I just found at the pho place next door. It was not! Sooooo, let me get to it. First BEWARE the \"yogurt soda\" . This is definately something you would have to spend alot of time with. It is exactly what it says it is. Imagine plain, unsweetened yogurt, you drop in plain, unflavored unsweetened soda water in and then add a tablespoon of salt. Sound good. Fuck no! And it is not.  Next.....!  Falafel: Meh! The croquettes could have been crispier on the outside and definately need a lot more flovor to these heavenly middle-eastern balls of goodness. The pickle was actually the best part.  The pita is NOT MADE FRESH!! Some reviews say they are but I can tell you the pita's came from a bag.  Gyro: Meh! The reason for the cone shaped meat loaf of lamb and beef is so the outside cooks quickly buy turning past extremely high heat and the inside stays moist as it is sliced away from the cone. In my Gyro there were no cooke meat ends, in fact it was just inside Gyro meat. I assume this is because they are busy and the outside meat was never given a chance to cook up again.....you see the inside becomes the outsude every slice of the way. I did not have nearly enough tzatziki, no cucumbers, no olive, no red onion. All essential in creating a tasty ass Gyro. I still contend that Jay's Gyros in Tempe are supreme!!  Lamb Tongue Sandwich: Lettuce, Tomato, Tongue wrapped in a bagged pita!! Boring. Dry. The Lamb Tongue is served in the pita WHOLE. I thought it would be sliced but it was'nt. Two little lamb tongue's boiled with ZERO flavor. Baba Gahnoush: OK......... Hummus: OK....... (Pita Jungle has a much heartier flavor on both items) Baklavah: We have a winner!!!! Some of the best I have tasted in recent memory. That will be my reason for a follow up.  I thought it was cool that they sold prayer mat's. The service is ok, nothing bad and nothing over the top.",

Like you're in some endless John Hughes film where you never, ever get to that final birthday cake scene? I hate unrequited love.   But at Haji Baba, the feeling's alllll mutual, baby.   No, really. They love me. I swear. Stop laughing.   The bestest service, the nicest chitchat and the friendliest not-creepy flirting. And, of course, the most delicious hummus (with a pickle on top).  OK, so maybe everyone gets the hummus. But does everyone get a big smile and a compliment from the kitchen staff?   Maybe it's because I always stop by after work, gussied up in heels and other lady-things. Maybe it's because I tip on takeout orders. Always. Or maybe it's just because I shop the store like I mean it: canned goods, feta, olives, pita, maybe some naan, baklava, wacky Eastern European chocolate, baba ganoush, spices, pistachios, etc. etc. etc. Not to mention the dirt-cheap, super-tasty kebab, shwarma and koubideh.

Essentially, you now have 1/2 a grocery store and 1/2 a restaurant -- which is what Haji-Baba is.  From the restaurant, I recommend shawarma plate, gyros, and any of the kabobs.  The food is cooked fresh, noticeably healthy, in large portion, and is remarkably low-priced.  Following your meal, I suggest you purchase an almond Baklava from the market. The almond Baklava (especially when heated for about 15 seconds in the microwave) is fantastic!  Also, the staff has always been great.  Meals are generally less than $10.  Fantastic value!

Although I have my favorite Mediterranean places for different dishes, I come to Haji Baba when I want a quick, cheap bite.  You can dine in for under $7 and get in and out in less than 30 minutes.    The ambiance is typical of the standard hole-in-the-wall middle eastern eatery.  During lunch time it gets busy, I have seen people waiting for a table to open up.  The wait staff is a loyal bunch that has worked there for years and it is always nice to see their familiar faces.  The hummus is good and the kalamatas are always a delicious treat.  I highly recommend ordering the homemade pita (not on the menu) with your hummus or your pita sandwich....Haji's finest:)  The Greek salad leaves much  to be desired as it consists solely of iceberg with the usual Greek veggies.  Eat here for the sandwiches or plates, not the salads.  In the grocery you can get a variety of inexpensive spices, olive oil, fresh olives, feta and many other tantalizing treats.  And don't forget to try one of the many different types of Baklava that they make as you are checking out!!  My favorite is the almond or the pecan....yummm!",

One last tip, if you're going for lunch, don't go straight at noon, there's usually a long line for a table (always a good sign tho').",

I highly recommend the chicken. The beef in my opinion is not that great or tasty and the sides that are served with it are not as tasty.  Falafel ... Humus... Everything else is really authentic and very tasty  When you walk in don't expect to be wild with the core... But expect to have some really tasty food",

I was pleased that Haji-Baba has stood the test of time.  The decor was exactly as I remembered it.  The market side was still chock-full of Middle Eastern staples.  The bakery case was filled to the brim with homemade baklava.  The dining area even had the same murals on the walls.  Very little has changed indeed at Haji-Baba in the last 10 years.  Haji-Baba offers great value-for-your-dollar.  You get a large quantity of tasty food for a very wallet-friendly price.  Don't get me wrong, this isn't the greatest Middle Eastern food served in the US, but it's very solid.  There's a reason Haji-Baba has been a staple with ASU students over the years.    The hummus was tasty and so were the olives.  The Gyro Plate had so much meat on it that I had to take half to go for lunch the next day.  The gyro meat is very good here, but it's not the best I have ever tasted.  That was at Jimmy's Gyros in Mykonos, Greece.  But I can certainly make do with Haji-Baba.",

I order the Gyro and fries and was blown away. The price was cheap; the meat was well seasoned and thinly sliced. I hate it when they slice it too thick.  All in all I had a great time the only reason why it didn't get five stars is it took a while because it was slammed during lunch.

If you enjoy what you eat in the dining area, walk five feet into the aisles and find the required ingredients! This place is actually run by Middle Easterners, not sure which nationality, but it feels authentic and not too Americanized.   SERVICE: No complaints, but not the most outgoing or warm service.

Their lamb tongue is mild in flavor, very tender, and compliments a side of some of the creamiest and most flavorful hummus I've ever eaten.   Haji-Baba is a great place to go for lunch and for authentic Middle Eastern groceries. If you haven't gone you're missing out. If you do go you have to try their tongue.

They offer the usual Mediterranean fare, I ordered the Gyro plate, Georgeann G had the lamb tongue sandwich, and we each also had a stuffed grape leaf. The stuffed grape leaves we served hot (which was a first) but they were HUGE compared to others I've had. The Meat was cooked to perfection (the lamb tongue was surprisingly very tasty) and the sides were freshly prepared as well.   Words of advice: go with the sandwich instead of a plate. The plate came with about 2 pounds of rice that was completely not needed (and the total price would've been much less if ordered separately). If you still want more, add a side salad or something.  The prices were very good and the service was nothing to complain about. It was hard to resist the baklava by the register, and we ended up taking a piece of cashew baklava to go (which was heavenly).   I'm glad I've had a chance to check this place out, and I will definitely go back.",
