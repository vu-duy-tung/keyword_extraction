The second time I came here they put American instead of cheddar and I can't eat American cheese which wouldn't have been a big deal but the man at the drive thru then argued with me and said it wasn't so I just left the drive thru takes forever and with all the other options out there for burgers these days I don't need to spend $8 and have a wrong order and 20 mins of my life gone sorry I really wanted this place to be something I shared with friends and coworkers but I will never go here again.",

I ditched the bread and just ate the patty, it was a bit red still in the middle. Can't complain that much though, it was .49!  Overall the burgers are decent and well priced. Get your order to go, they left both front doors open because it was nice outside. This backfired because the flies started coming in from outside and were pestering me in the dining room during my meal. The staff was nice, and were happy to help.",

Asked for a double cheeseburger combo and paid $7 Wait was fairly long and when my order showed up at the table it was just a cheeseburger not a double. Looked at the receipt and that's what I was charged for so I took it. Big bun lots of veggies but idk how they get the patty so thin. Could barely taste any meat and it was pink! Couldn't tell if the burger was cold inside our not with all the cold lettuce and tomato. Could've had any number of other burgers for the $ and they would have all been better. Also they have the soda fountain with \"100 choices\" but there was more choices sold out than there were avail",

    "text": "The quantity is extremely good for the price. I ordered the mushroom burger, and a small side of onions rings, and that small basket in which it came in was heavily loaded, and almost overloaded. No complaint there in the prices.  I am a burger fanatic, and was looking forward to checking the place out. I went on a Thursday morning (5/22- ~9am). There wasn't much action when I got there, there was a lady waiting for a to-go, and one seated. I took my time to check the menu out completely, and could not avoid hearing one of the employees complaining about a customer who had been there earlier. Wow, but none of my business. Once I ordered  I headed over to the bathrooms, only to find it filthy. There was toilet paper scattered on the floor, dried up pee stains, and sink covered in random hairs. Never had I been so glad I had hand sanitizer, and I got out of that pigsty. I went over to sit down, and soon after noticed that the women seated near me had received her order wrong twice before, and she seemed happy that the third time was a charm. Yay. My food didn't take too long to come out, and it came out pretty warm, and fresh. The burger lacked flavor, if I hadn't seen it for myself I would have never guessed it had any mushrooms, but the rings were freakin' fantastic. About halfway my meal I decided I'd get some ketchup from the dispensers near me, and was shocked to find that they were all empty, I sat right back down with great disappointment. But the icing on the cake was when half way my burger I pull out this wonderfully long, blonde hair out of the burger.  . .that is where I had to call it quits. It was just one thing after another. . . My overall experience at this place was just awful. I had been very excited to visit the location, and see what it was all about, but this visit pretty much killed it for me. I don't plan on returning, not unless it improves it's ways, and becomes a life or death situations.",

It was dripping with grease which made the bun soggy and the pineapple slices were so thick it was almost impossible to eat. The second time i tried the classic cheese burger. It was perfectly average. Reminded me of a large Burger King burger which isn't really a bad thing. Each time it was the fries that made it worth while. They were cooked to perfection and weren't puny soggy things like most fast food places. I would go back and would not hesitate to recommend it, but really I just want the fries.",

I wanted to get a turkey burger, but they were out so I ordered a regular burger with a side of fries.  The burger had a nice, char grilled flavor but the bun was a bit dry and somewhat crumbly (not my favorite thing), and the fries had some sort of nice spicy coating that was especially nice.   Unfortunately I'm trying to cut down on such food in my time of middle age (the whole heart attack thing is a drag right?) but seems like a fun place with nice staff. I probably won't go there again but if you like to eat burgers on a regular basis it might be worht checking out.",

    "text": "I ordered from here today using GrubHub.  I'm a little guilty to say that I woke up this morning starving to death and found these guys open early and close enough to my work that GrubHub would work.  I ordered a kraut dog, chili cheese fries, a double cheeseburger with pickles, and fried broccoli...I did mention I was starving.  Obviously I wasn't able to eat all of it, but I sampled each item.  The fried broccoli was a bit of a let down.  It's as if the broccoli itself doesn't really cook and get soft like mushrooms and zucchini do.  The chipotle dipping sauce was good, if you like the taste of chipotle. The kraut dog was really good, it's very big and loaded with sauerkraut that you can tell they cooked on the griddle to heat it up.  The bun was very good too.  The double cheeseburger was HUGE.  It's a decent tasting burger.  The chili cheese fries were also huge, but I wasn't a big fan of the chili.  It's a bit too sweet for me when it comes to chili.  My lady ordered a small chili which she said she liked and interestingly enough she ordered the sourdough bacon burger melt.  She really liked that too, and i was impressed with it's size as well.  To be honest, I was a bit afraid to order from here, and even more ashamed to admit how much unhealthy food I ordered for myself, but at the end of the day, I have TONS of leftover food I can nibble on for dinner, and it's not half bad.  My delivery experience was mainly positive, they got the order right, delivered it right on time and everything was still hot.  My only complaint is that, for some odd reason, they just dropped it on our receptionist's front desk and left.  I had to wander into our lobby to discover it just kinda chilling there on her desk.  Just to note, I'm a bit confused about one of the recent one star reviews in which they specifically ordered no mushrooms and got mushrooms anyway.  Mushrooms aren't a standard topping, so there seems to be no need to ask for no mushrooms, unless they ordered a mushroom burger, but what kind of madman would order a mushroom burger with no mushrooms?  It will perplex me for some time to come.",

    "text": "Well we made the trek from Gilbert to Tempe specifically to get burgers and onion rings from this place because my mother in law raved about the o-rings.   Not impressed honestly. Here's why, while the onion rings were actually really good, the burgers left SO much to be desired! We ordered an ABC (avocado, bacon and cheese) burger with no lettuce or tomato (picky brother in law), a spicy chicken sandwich (the wife) and a patty melt (for myself). My patty melt was pretty greasy as one should expect from a patty melt, but it didn't seem to come from the burger, but from the butter on the bread or onions because the burger itself was really dry and honestly spongy in the worst way possible. It definitely had the texture of either being previously frozen OR the burger mix was severely overmixed, to the point of being more of a burger batter than a ground meat patty. I snuck a bite of my brother in laws burger (for science!!) and it was EXACTLY the same texture. Like a sad dried out sponge topped with cheap bread. If anyone has ventured into the dark world of microwaved cheeseburgers, this burger will take you back to that sad lonely place, seriously that is the first thing I thought of with my first bite.   As for the chicken sandwich, the \"spicy\" added to the sandwich was actually just tangy buffalo sauce which wasn't anything to write home about to be sure.   The reason I'm giving this place even 2 stars is because their onion rings and fries were both super delicious, how a place can go so right and so wrong all at the same time is beyond me.  For now I'll just skip the 30 min trek to burger rush and stop by Smash burger or Burgerfi to satisfy my craving.",

I do like the zucchini  sticks. The third time coming here I now realize why there are rarely many people eating here. There was this girl at the register, she was a bit rude. While I was waiting for over 20 minutes for my 3 milkshakes I overheard her having a conversation with a customer about the gumball she was chewing. Before assisting this customer, she put 25 cents into the candy machine and put the gumball in her mouth. She was apologizing to the customer because she had a gumball in her mouth and continued to talk about how hard they are. This baffled me, as I myself manage a restaurant. This was extremely unprofessional of her to chew on any sort of food while working. This should never happen in any food establishment. Utter unprofessional-ism and disrespect to the place she works at. This is three strikes and your out. I will just make my zucchini myself.",

We had wondered who that belonged to, we thought it was a drive thru order\".  I heard her say to the other staff \"that meal we couldn't place actually belonged to #92 who was sitting out there\".  You would have thought that the four people working their would have made the connection between a mystery order and a customer sitting for 20 minutes waiting for food, which they clearly noticed.  When I did finally get my meal, the onion rings were cold and the chili dog was disgusting.  Despite the fact that I was clearly upset and that it was pretty clear the food had been sitting out, no attempt at getting me fresh food or offering me a full or partial refund or even a coupon was made.  The manager walked by and did not even acknowledge me.  I am definitely not going back",

It was like old school style (Bob's big boy), with the thousand island dressing, the works, on a sesame bun. The fries on the other hand were just OK. I expected fresh old school style fries, but they were just like the regular fries at burger king. It had that coating on it. Eh! The small order of zucchini was large enough to be shared by 2 or 3 people, and tasted a little on the bland side. Great coating on it though and it could have benefited from having more than 1 tiny container of ranch to go with it. I tried the drive-thru and that was a big mistake. It took too long (definitely not even close to the speed of most fast food joints) and I was late getting back to work. Try it when you have more than enough time on your hands.",

We're definitely going to try to come back during happy hour from 2 to 4 PM where you get a burger, fries and a Coke for $4.99.  I usually don't give five stars on my first visit but the price, food, atmosphere and service was great, so how could I not?  P. S. I love the little penguin!",

OK so the review above is when I was helped by one of the managers, maybe she was having a bad day, or maybe she needs a lesson in customer service.

Any one of the burgers is a good choice. my fav is the egg and bacon.  You have to ask them to slice the onions, or you'll get chopped (which I think only belong on Hot dogs). They make their own sauces, and they are the bomb. Twice the size of a regular little plastic cup, so when they charge you .60 its worth it. The fried foods are what the good sauces are for, but not needed, as everything Ive had fried from them so far is delicious by itself. The Chicken strips are large and juicy, and come on a mound of fries. The service is top notch, and friendly. They are alway experimenting with the menu, and special items. So I never have my mind made up before coming here to eat. I wish they were open a little earlier for the breakfast burritos.    And I burn my damn tongue on the poppers every time!",

    "text": "I ordered burger rush through Uber eats. 20 minutes later   I get a call from one of their employees who then tells me they are out of their chili and asked if I would like to substitute anything else in its place. I asked isn't the chili the main ingredient in your nachos? The answer was yes so because I already placed the order I told the representative to let me look at the menu real quick and I will pick something else. The rep responded with; okay do you want to call us back.... at this point I already assumed that customer service isn't in burger rushes training manual if even in their vocabulary. I just told him yes. 2 minutes later I call back to order a avocado bacon cheese burger I reach the same rep and he advised me to hold on so he could get his manager to make the change. The manager picks up the phone and says so you would like to get the abc burger instead of the nachos? I responded no, but because you guys are out of chili, the burger would be my next best option and even though the burger and nachos are the same price I was advised that it would be an additional $2 and if I didn't want to pay it I was told to cancel my order. Now keep in mind this is 30 minutes after I placed my order that I am dealing with this. At that point I asked to speak with the manager and I was told \"I am the manager\". I said I'm not paying a price difference for this order your menu pricing is the same. His response was \"I don't like the way you're  speaking to me you're very rude and I'm very tired.\" I said excuse me what's your name and he said cancel the order and hung up on me. What a poor excuse for leadership in a place of business. As a business owner if that was my establishment there would be some strong influence on how to service your customers properly. What a bad example this \"manager\" set for his employees. Welcome to the service industry kid I hope you read this and you're better off finding a job at a car wash if you don't like the way dissatisfied customers talk to you. This was my first and last experience with that place. Hopefully the owner will step up and set some things straight. That was the worst experience that I can ever recall having with a restaurant in my life.",

I paid a premium to order through Eat24, figuring it would be harder to mess up without having to hear me on the phone over a load kitchen. However instead of a nice & light turkey burger with no tomato and no mayo, I got a double cheeseburger drowning in mayonnaise with tomatoes. I ate it of course, because I was starving, but it was not good. The french fries were undercooked and soggy, with he consistency of wet noodles. Gross.   There were some good things - food showed up in about 45 minutes, driver was friendly, and they got my beverage right. The tuna salad I ordered for later wasn't terrible. I probably won't order again though.",

On multiple occasions, we've been served fries that were so over seasoned that we had to spit them out.  Burgers are carelessly thrown together and falling apart. That freshness we once tasted was replaced with old wilted lettuce and cold meat grease.

But when I bit into it, it was super spicy and I could not eat it. Do not order from here. I've read a lot of other reviews that say they mess up the orders and I'm telling you it's True. Plus the delivery woman was very rude. DO NOT ORDER OR EAT FROM THIS RESTAURANT.",

Fries also got soggy.  $19 for two meals   While waiting in the drive through saw one of the delivery drivers go from his car straight to the kitchen. Not sure 100% if he was cooking but he was handling somebody's food. Also checked his text messages on his phone and wiped the sweat off his face, scratched his eyes (he was wearing vision glasses) - no gloves while handling food in kitchen.   I called to give my feedback was fresh food if I came back.  The person that answered the phone was not that interested in my feedback (he said he was one of the managers).   I wanted to like this place - will give it another try someday but this was a bad first time experience.",

    "text": "**Unreal**. I ordered delivery from Burger Rush and under the special instructions I clearly wrote exactly what I wanted on my burger due to the fact that I am allergic to tomatoes. The delivery was very fast, tthe delivery driver was great and I tipped him $10 on a $12 tab to show my gratitude for the great service. Once I walked inside and unwrapped my burger I realized they had completely disregarded my request for toppings and included tomatoes, which I am very allergic to. When I gave them a call I asked if they could see the special instructions on a Yelp order and the gentleman on the phone said he saw the instructions which made me more frustrated. He then offered to bring another burger, but I was unable to take him up on that because I didn't have time to wait for another meal. He then offered me a refund, but was extremely rude when he told me he would have to send a driver with my cash refund. Despite the terrible attitude he said he would send the driver with my refund. ***hours went by and closing time came around and still no driver with my refund*** I am absolutely blown away that they would be rude to me for calling to let them know they put an ingredient on my burger that would trigger a very serious reaction and then blatantly lie to me about bringing a refund. I am at a loss for words at how I was treated when this could have been such a dangerous situation just to be lied to! I can't say I'll ever order from here again. Complete trash. (Again, the driver was amazing and exceeded my expectations. The shake was also great)",

If you were blindfolded, brought inside and then had the blindfold removed, I'd bet most people would initially say that they were inside a Wendy's. The tables hadn't been bused in a while. Crumbs and order #'s littered the tabletops. The decor was...meh. I love going to new (local) spots to see how they chose to decorate and brand their business. Some understand how to do this and the importance behind it...Oreganos, Pita Jungle, Cheba Hut, Cornish Pasty, etc. This placed lacked all of that...to the point that I couldn't remember the name (I thought it was Burger Hut) when it came time to write this review. As for the staff, they were friendly and helpful.   Now, on to the food! I had the Avocado Bacon Cheese burger. The patty was definitely higher quality than Wendy's ;) The bacon was thick cut, REAL bacon!! The fries were crispy on the outside and had perfect consistency on the inside. I love ranch, so naturally I asked for a side to dip my fries in. The ranch was thick and had the homemade flavor you can only find when visiting small town restaurants in places like Scobey, Montana...YUM! It was a huge side too!!   -1 star for decor and ambiance -1 star for unkempt tables  The food and customer service were great and this place has a lot of potential! Bus the tables more frequently and give your place a fresh, unique look :)",

They didn't ask me extra dumb questions or force me to sign up somewhere else. I ordered an Avocado Bacon Cheeseburger with extra Swiss, Ortega pepper, and Thousand Island. I also specified in the special instructions: no ice in drink.  My food arrived in 15 minutes on a Sunday afternoon. Yes, my confirmation email was postmarked 5:36pm and by the time I closed the door and glanced at my computer, it was 5:51. I must say that is a great performance. The delivery man was smiling and helpful, but in a hurry (aren't they all?)  My order arrived exactly as specified. I am especially picky about the \"NO ICE\" orders I make. I will save you the rant. It was a lot of food. A generous packet of fries with the nice savory crust on them that I love. Not too much salt. A few packets of Hunt's ketchup were included but I used my own lime mayo. I ate the fries first, and I was nearly full already. The burger was a single patty but huge. It dropped some lettuce as I ate but generally stayed together. Points for that. I love Ortega peppers! I almost ordered the Ortega burger, but there was no description available. Anyway, this had the best of all worlds with bacon, avocado, and Ortega. The food wasn't hot, but it was clearly freshly made. And I have scalded my tongue enough times to say that hot food is overrated.  I will definitely order this way again. The price was about the usual for delivery these days - $23 with 15% tip. Of course, I had ordered the most expensive burger with extras. I don't frequent this part of town and I have never walked into this restaurant, but I am glad it came up in a Yelp search. Bon appetit!",

This particular visit my boss went and picked up our food. Even though we ordered during \"happy hour\", my meal was almost $8 for burger, fries, and a drink which they advertise at $4.99 during HH. I wasn't there, though, so I'm not sure if happy hour excludes to go orders (not sure why it would, this is basically a glorified Wendy's, not a full service place). Maybe it was because I got a cheeseburger rather than a hamburger, but thats some awfully spendy cheese if that's the case. Or maybe it was just rung up wrong, which seems most likely to me. The food is pretty standard. It's nothing i would brag about or even go back for if it wasn't close. The other thing is that it takes a LONG time to get your order. Even when the place is empty. So, overall, you could do better, you could do worse.",

Yesterday my fries were forgotten i suggested a credit, but the driver insisted  on returning with hot fries and he did. I have wanted to try the steak sand for some time its a bit pricey but yesterday i couldn't resist. I added a swiss cheese, it came without  and the bread was a bit hard 3 thick slices of tomato was over whelming for 1 piece of leaf lettuce the presentation did nothing to help the sandwich  decent thin slices of meat with bread. I asked if the sandwich would be hot and was told yes perhaps  she misunderstood the meat was warm but the bread wasn't even slightly toasted anyways I took the sandwich apart added cheese to both sides of bread and put them in the toaster oven i sliced the meat into strips and put them in a frying pan until the cheese melted added more lettuce and ate only half. I really like their burgers the ckn Cesar wrap, fries, onion rings , shakes, I love it all But the pricey sandwich with added cheese about 9$ don't make happy. I didnt even care about the fries that was no problem. But the lack of effort in designing and making the sandwich is very disappointing. I should have called to complain but im not asking for anything for free that's all I would have gotten I just would have appreciated more effort in such an expensive sandwich.",

I waited about 15 min and my order came.  Along with a rude guy with attitude.  He asked me how I was going to pay.  I said pay what? He said I needed to pay for my order.  I was told it would be waived.  Then he said he would trade me the sandwich they gave me for the sandwich I wanted. Which goes against all sanitation rules. And It  had already been eaten by a coworker. I paid for it, I can give it to who I want.  This guy continues to argue with me IN MY PLACE OF WORK, IN THE MIDDLE OF THE OFFICE about how my order was wrong and that I need to pay attention to what I'm ordering. And said if I didn't order the wrong sandwich who did! I'm in awe are you serious!?!? You screw up an order and it's my fault.  If I'm correct the customer is always right.  Hmmmm. Y'all have terrible customer service. If you're going to come to someone's place of business you should have respect.  Plain and simple.  I'm not even mad about the food.  I'm mad at how I was treated then was told I'd have to basically pay double for a sandwich! So wrong on so many levels. If you order from this place don't order through grub hub!

At a certian time, I didn't get it until 2 but I was more than happy with it. They even misread my order and made sure to remake it and have it sent to me again. Quickly and promptly, Very wonderful service. And I'm all about breakfast at the moment so having it for lunch is a plus!!",

We had to repeat and repeat and wait and wait and then repeat again, and well....I ended up keeping the signed receipt because I got tired of holding it out the window for the cashier to come get it, after five minutes I set it down in the car and forgot about it. So did the cashier. I know they got paid though my card was charged.   But the food was incredibly good. I had a Mushroom Burger. my son had a double burger. The fries were hot and delicious, the burgers huge and delicious. And so despite the service we'll probably come back again.",

We talked about cows and petting zoo types of farms. Additional times, staff have been friendly/courteous.   I just have to be careful that I get exactly what I order, as I try to get a grilled cheese with cheddar (not American cheese) but wit the veg that comes with the burger and this isn't always what's in my bag. So double check your order before you leave the restaurant if you customize something!  Also the restaurant does have an odd smell. I can't quite place it, definitely musty, but don't let that deter you from ordering great food!",

    "text": "Yo stop knocking this place because of the Unereats app. Lame.  For those of us who live on the south side, or in Tempe, or just not near an in and out burger I'm telling you this is the spot to go to. The burgers are gigantic and legit. They have a buy one get one for a $0.49 burger after 3 p.m. and from 2 p.m. to close they have a deal where you can get a burger, a sundae, fries and a drink all for $4.99.  What makes this place special is the fact that they hand make everything. One particular item that I absolutely enjoy, which isn't on the drive-thru menu, is there fried broccoli with Chipotle dipping sauce. Check the photo from my review for a comprehensive list of their dipping sauces. What's even better is now they have cheese crisps with handmade fresh pico de gallo and chips. So if you want a quick Mexican food snack I would recommend going here instead of the Filibertos down the street. You can check my review on that particular location as well.  Burger Rush is seriously so freaking delicious and legit I can't say enough good things about them. They have milkshakes as well which are incredible and hotdogs which I haven't tried yet. Oh and by the way they deliver! So if you don't want to go inside or hop in your car and go through the drive-thru just have them bring you your food.   As someone who spends as much time in bed as I do,  this is a freaking Mecca.   A++++",

Everything was cooked perfectly and it was fairly quick (not mcdonalds quick) made from scratch quick.  They have enough options that if you ordered something you don't like then you probably didn't take the time to craft the right order.  The staff took the time to help us newbies with the menu and made awesome suggestions.  Give them a chance, it's a good joint that we need in Tempe.  They also DELIVER!",

    "text": "WARNING***** the chicken on the Spicy Chicken Sandwich is CHICKEN FRIED STEAK!!!!    I would give them zero stars if I could... here's why... I walked into the establishment and went to the counter.  There was a long haired blonde lady behind the register. I asked her what was on the veggie wrap. She said \"Honestly, I dont know. I have never eaten that\" and stared blankly back at me waiting for me to order.  I then said \"Does anyone here know what is on the veggie wrap?\" She asked the cook and he replied \"Veggies.\"  Well no s***.  I asked him to elaborate. He said \"Uhm, cucumber, lettuce, tomato.....oh and mushrooms!\" I decided to not get this due to the fact that no one could even describe what was on it.  I proceeded to order a Spicy Chicken Sandwich and my companion ordered a Classic Burger, fries and a drink.  We handed the lady 20.00 and she gave me back 3.00 in quarters, stating that she no longer had ones.  We waited 12 minutes for our food even though we were the only ones waiting for food in the establishment. Upon receiving my Spicy Chicken Sandwich, I took a bite (luckily small) and noticed the meat was a dark shade of gray and had the consistency of a rubber tire.  Upon asking for a refund, the cook stated that its a \"Chicken-steak mixture, kind of like a chicken fried steak.\"  He then proceeded to offer a chicken nugget consistency type chicken sandwich.  It was 6.25 for the sandwich only.  I would expect a delicious, juicy, tender piece of chicken, not a mixture of steak and chicken.  There was no apology for the disgusting piece of meat I received. Also, the burger my companion received was a meat patty of approximately 2cm in height. The fixings were the cheapest shredded ice-burg lettuce, a thinly sliced tomato, and enough thousand island to kill a horse.  The fries were salty and soggy, if thats your fancy, get the fries only.",

    "text": "Not consistent, left me ill   For what it's worth I have enjoyed the food I've gotten at Burger Rush. I've been there three times but I won't be returning. The third visit left me with a stomach ache that kept me on the couch or in bed for half the day. This is corroborated by my friend whom I dined with and experienced the same symptoms the next day. (We don't live with one another and that was the only occasion that week when we were together, or ate together) Each visit it seemed as though the food was different, the burgers and the fries, but specifically the fries. (Ranging from soggy, to too much batter, not enough) These three visits to Burger Rush were within the first two months they were open, so I can excuse the inconsistency, but there is no excuse for poor quality food or poorly cooked food that leaves their customers with stomach pains. In addition, I was very disappointed that they didn't have sweet potato tots, which are on the menu but apparently they don't carry them (I've unsuccessfully ordered them three times ha). Service was mediocre, and often took a while to receive your food, specifically for a burger joint with a drive thru. I've waited 20 minutes for two burgers in their drive thru. Overall really disappointed, I live in the neighborhood and have a demand for a burger joint that's open past last call.  On the plus side, after a peek at the other reviews, it doesn't seem as though anyone else has gotten ill from eating at Burger Rush. Could have been isolated, but once is one too many, not taking my chances.",

I'm seeing some positive reviews about the burger so I wonder if they have changed anything since I went in a month ago or so. My burger was an obviously pre-frozen patty that was cooked to well-done destruction. Bun and toppings were Meh. It's a burger so they didn't screw anything up to the point of being unedible. So if you want Meh go for it.  The place is a shade above your Burger King or McDonald's but for the price, or if you want a GOOD burger, there's no reason not to go to In-N-Out.",

Maybe I don't get out much but that was definitely a first. So I place an order for delivery and what arrived was not what I ordered,  despite the fact that the delivery guy checked and assured me the order was correct. I asked for a wheat bun and did not get one, they say their burgers come with lettuce, pickles, onions, tomatoes, and a sauce, my \"burger\" was a wet bun, a pattie and some cheese (mainly stuck to the foil and paper wrapper. Then to top it all off, the fries were stale, like leftover reheated fries and were not edible in my opinion. This was my first and will be my LAST meal at Burger Rush, what you get is definitely NOT worth what you pay for!! TERRIBLE!!",

    "text": "Updated 9/12/14 to 2 stars:  Pretty much stopped going here, after being a big fan early on.  1) Drive-Thru: The order is wrong EVERY single &%$&* time in the last 8 times I've been here. I can't leave the drive-through without taking everything out of the bag and making sure it's all correct, and it never is anymore unless I order 1 single item - and even then they never offer you the sauce or dip the order comes with.  2) Delivery: Tried it once, never again. An hour and a half after ordering, it arrives but just like the drive-thru, the order is mostly wrong, items are omitted, but in this case the poor driver has to go back and we have to wait another 30 min for the rest of the order.  To the phone and drive-thru order-takers: Coke is not the same thing as the other drinks we ordered, and a small side is not the same as a large side especially when we're paying for the latter. It's not an arguable point.  3) Food: The burger has fallen apart, both figuratively and literally. It hasn't tasted good in a while now, no longer tastes like a smoke-grilled burger, which set it apart from the fast food chains down the street. It doesn't really have a taste anymore beyond the tomato and cheap cheese. The last 5 burgers have been a lopsided mess; having to scrape off and throw away soaked and liquid-squishy bottom buns kind of ruins it. And the shredded lettuce falling out everywhere got old quick.  I hung in there hoping it was just a temporary loss of quality control (employee turnover, etc), but when each of at least the last half-dozen visits have been nothing but hassle and disappointment the problem appears to be with ownership, management, and lack of employee training or poor treatment. Nobody there now seems to give a crap about getting the order right and rather than call back or check with you at the window to clarify, they just substitute whatever they want when they forget what you ordered and let you get home to discover the surprise.  I've had enough surprises and short-changing on orders, looking elsewhere now.  ===============================================  Old 4-star review:  It's a burger joint that isn't Burger King, McD's, etc. Their burger meat usually* has a char grilled/smokey flavor that tastes better than the engineered flavor replacements mcD's, BK, etc use.  Their fries are GREAT - nothing like the soggy/floppy McD's or ounce-of-salt-per-fry BK fries. They're fresh and cooked just right (balanced between soft and crisp) and usually* there's plenty of them in your order.  Their fried zucchini and ranch are GREAT every time, we've never been disappointed with it. We're told they make their own ranch dip, and I can give them the benefit of the doubt on that because it's really really good, seems far better than I usually get elsewhere.   Their chicken sandwich is pretty good too, and has some spices that adds a lot of character to it. My GF says their fish sandwich is pretty good as well.  The staff have been friendly, professional, accommodating, and usually* the order is correct.  Some others have commented about long drive-thru waits. It does take longer than the chain fast food places (about 8-10 minutes from the time you pull up to place the order) but that's because they cook it fresh to order here. I've never had stale, dried-out food, so for me the extra few minutes are totally worth it and not a negative thing.  Overall, we really like the food and we get take-out from there routinely, at least once every 1-2 weeks.",

I've had a burger a few times and it was good, but for the price and the exponential wait times, I think I'm done with this place. It's a saturated market for burgers and breakfast burritos around Tempe, so you really need to set yourself apart to keep your clientele coming back and unfortunately Burger Rush just hasn't been up to par.

It's a burger joint, I don't expect much in service but I walked up to the counter no one is there. After 2 minutes a girl with short dark hair and glasses walks up, I say hi, she doesn't acknowledge me, and leans so she can greet the people who just walked in. She then proceeds to take their order, still ignoring me. Finally after several more minutes a guy from the back walks up and hands me my to go order that was sitting right there.   Order # 290867.

Opens early and closes late, with quality ingredients and a wide range of options for most palates and dietary preferences. Favorites for me include the mesquite grilled double classic double burger with cheese, and the turkey burger. Wide variety of ads-in's, too. Tried the 3 meat omelette with hash browns for breakfast today and was pleased all around. Nice dining room, so I like to skip the drive-thru and eat while the food is freshest. Looking forward to trying the many specialty sandwiches, burgers, and sides.  Give it a try-- this joint deserves to succeed!",

We ordered the Cowboy Burger, the avocado bacon cheeseburger, and the cheesy bacon french fries online through yelp. The total before tip was $27.18. The food was delivered by the right time listed, the driver was friendly, and we loved the burgers and french fries. The portions were large and the two burgers and big order of cheese fries were too much for my boyfriend and I to finish in one sitting. I reheated some of the food today and it still tastes amazing. I am so glad I tried this place and will order again from them in the future.",

Everything is fresh made to order, mesquite wood grilled. Onion rings crispy crunchy hot and fresh. When I order fries I always ask them for extra crispy they always please to order. Friendly staff and establishment is very clean. I did read some of the comments on here people if you want to salad go to a salad bar or a vegetarian place don't go to a hamburger place to get a Caesar salad. It's like me going to a vegetarian place and ordering a hamburger. As far as value this is not McDonald's this is Mesquite Grill of course it's going to be a little more, it cost me maybe three dollars more to have 10 times better quality and taste. They're dipping and salad dressing are all freshly made and our excellent! My bill was roughly around $14 double cheeseburger onion rings large drink and a ranch dressing.",

The breakfast was great and I dumped alot of dough in the place because I just had to run across the street and not drive for lunch.  Eventually my work took me away and I hadn't been back for about 2 years. Anyway, I recently moved and man was I excited when I went through drive through for first time in long time.  Guy at window was friendly enough however my order was short 1 large onion ring.   I basically paid about $15 for burger fries ( no rings). Yeah I was mad but whatever it happens.  I then ordered about a week later through GH and left a note for the crew about what happened. WOW. These guys came through with giant extra onion rings and I was swimming in ketchup.  Point is. Food is great, people are great, and service mistakes will happen but just talk to them. They will make things right.",

The cashier answered all our questons regarding what was in the burgers we were interested in. He was extremely helpful recommending burgers. I wish they'd include what each burger had on a smaller menu, but it's not that difficult to simply ask either.  The largest drink is a 32oz. They have the Coke machine that has all the different types of drinks and flavors. That's always great.  Everything was clean and organized. Our meal came within 5-10 minutes.  I got the Hula Hula Burger (around $8 with fries) which has your basic trimmings on it, plus ham, swiss, extremely juicy pineapple, and teriyaki sauce. It was a pretty big burger. I struggled to take bites, but thats not even bad!  The fries were incredible! Someone else mentioned they're a little on the soggy side. I'm a fan of this so I was thrilled. If you like them this way, they're really heavenly. If you prefer crispy, let them know. I'm sure they'll make adjustments! I'll definitely be going back. I live nearby and they deliver so I'll be taking advantage of that!  I wish they would get a tip jar because everything was so wonderful and they definitely deserved it!  Tldr; The service, establishment, burgers, fries, and drinks are great. The price is a tiny bit higher than BK or McDonald's, but worth it!!!",

I called back and the manager on duty place me on hold for a while and then asked if I wanted him to remake the food. Honestly, I told him I didn't want to wait another 2 hours for food.

After getting home and realizing they had forgotten to put my order of fries in the bag during my last visit, we went back. When we went in, the manager not only gave us one order of fries, but two or three. He also refilled our order of onion rings and offered us free drinks! It's high quality fast food, and this kind of customer service is what will keep us coming back for a long time. Thank you, Burger Rush!",

I also had the Hula burger and I thought the flavor combinations were fantastic. The bun was slightly soggy, but that could be my fault for getting a burger delivered to my house. I also snagged a bite of my friends Ghost pepper burger and it also had great flavor and was cooked really well. His bun wasn't soggy (so I think it could have just been the burger ingredients on mine). All in all a great pick!   Only negative was not including napkins!",

Your workers need to figure out how to put things in the bag that people pay for, and learn consistency. I can't believe someone literally looked at that and thought that was a normal size and put that in the bag. I've gone here before once and it was a normal size. Btw I have never written a review before but this was ridiculous..",

Asked for a recommendation from the girl at the counter.  She recommended the ABC (Avacado, Bacon, Cheese) and yes.. it was delicious.  I ended up with the meal that included fries and a drink.  I also ordered the chipotle ranch to dip my fries into. Total was a little over $11.  A little over priced for lunch.    But the burger was good, (bottom bun was a little mushy likely because of the lettuce water.  The avacado was perfect, the bacon and burger were perfectly seasoned and cooked.  The fries were the best part of the entire meal.  I will likely be coming back again.   Thanks!!",

I didn't really pay any attention to it, nor pay attention to whether the burger I got was any good or not. It didn't create a lasting impression.   I don't know if something changed in the meantime, but a week ago, I went back. Ordered a double cheeseburger, thinking that I was getting something along the range of Five Guys. I was wrong. Pleasantly so. This burger, which was (roughly) the same price as Five Guys was much larger and much more flavorful.   I went back again this week, and was happy to discover they do their bugerss bun-less (as a lettuce wrap). Once again, I was pleasantly surprised by the portion size, the construction, and flavor of my meal.   Recently, as I've been eating Paleo, I've been going to Red Robin a lot. It's a little pricey after tip. Instead, I'll be heading to Burger Rush at least once every couple weeks. It's truly a hidden gem.",

It's best to ignore those ads they have posted outside for 49 or 99 cent burgers, you're not walking out of this place with a meal for less than $6-7 bucks. It was something along the lines of a buy one, get one for a bit less.  So if youre just one person trying to get a quick lunch and not be obese, then you have no use for a second cheeseburger.   I had a burger, fries, and drink, all of it was above average for a sketchy burger dive. The place is kinda dirty, no bugs though so that's a plus i guess.  Service was meh from the employees, you get vibe that they're trying to do their best in spite of crappy ownership.

Not my favorite hamburger but a really good option -and a thousand times better than anything you could get at McDonalds.   Cons:  Drive thru person was both overly anxious to take our order but slow to get the details right.  It wasn't a complicated order -a hamburger with swiss, a double with swiss, and a double with cheddar, lettuce, tomato, mayo and an order of fries.

I explained where I was, and he said that he would be here shortly about 10 minutes later I received another call from home asking for directions again, and another 10 minutes later he said that he was pulling into the area and then I had to stay on the phone with him for 3 minutes explaining each turn he had to take, and even then he couldn't manage to find my house. I finally just came out to the street to wave him down. The entire thing was incredibly frustrating! This place is less than 10 minutes from my house!

Nice flavor, great combination of toppings, (lettuce, cheese, onions, tomatoes, thousand island, and pickles) I love how they give out yellow peppers and jalapenos, the fries were great as well. The girl working behind the counter was very nice and helpful. I explained to her that it was my first time being in Burger Rush and she gave me the run down on the menu. I will be back to try to chili dogs... I also like how they have the Coca Cola freestyle machines... Great choice of beverages...  I like this place and will be back...   I see that they have a great \"happy hour\" with lower priced food options... A steal if you ask me...",

    "text": "I used to be a big fan of this place, fresh, unique burgers and chicken sandwices. The fried zucchini was bomb and the broccoli too! But last weekend we went, through the drive thru, and the food was NOT AT ALL what it once was. The fried zucchini was barely warm, and had obviously been made prior and kept luke warm under a heat lamp. I ordered a gyro, which had barely any meat on it at all. We were really disappointed, since this place used to be a favorite burger joints around! It seems that things are not fresh, generous or put much care into anymore..I guess thats what happens when a small business gets off its feet a bit...it begins cutting corners. What a shame. Now we just go to in and out instead. I'll miss the quality that burger rush once had.",

    "text": "I work in the hospitality industry and rarely ever complain about anything that may go wrong during my time at or with another establishment in the business, since it is just food after all. However, what happened tonight is absolutely unacceptable.   So, I ordered through the eat24 app and the delivery guy showed up in a reasonable amount of time, so everything seemed like it was just going to be your run-of-the-mill delivery service. NOPE! I ordered nachos, a cheeseburger combo with fries and a 32oz soda, an Oreo milkshake, and a side of blue cheese dressing. The guy hands me the milkshake and I couldn't remember the total, so I asked him and he responds with \"I don't remember, I didn't bring the receipt. I also don't have my phone on me, so you can call if you'd like.\" Uh, whatever guy, I'll just look it up on my email. The total was $23.36, so I gave him $29 and told him to keep the rest for a tip. Then he gives me my food and says that he \"forgot my soda\" and that he'll \"go back and get it for me\" and \"throw in an additional soda for the inconvenience\". Me being the rational person I am agrees to that and I'm still not upset at this point. I only live 3 minutes from this place, so it didn't seem like a big deal for him to have to drive back there and then back here, and I tipped over 20% on top of that. Then I go to check the bag and there is no straw for my milkshake and the blue cheese dressing is nowhere to be found, so my boyfriend called the store and a woman answered and assured him that the dressing would be coming with the drinks. We wait for 30 minutes and nothing has shown up yet, so we call again. Woman assures my boyfriend that the delivery guy is coming back. We wait another 45 minutes and still, nothing. Try to call again and nobody answers.   So, basically they stole like $5 from me and also, my food was cold when it arrived. Awesome, thanks a lot for the superior customer service. I won't go without a fight, Burger Rush, you will be delivering my soda to me at some point in time. Or else I will make it my life's work to destroy your reputation, not that you would actually need help in that. Your employees are doing a great job already.",

I requested cheddar cheese in the UberEats app and-- strangely--got a slab of cheddar between the burgers, and  American cheese on top. I don't like American cheese, but the burger was still good. The french fries were not good. They arrived as a big, soggy blob in a paper envelope. [side note: The last time I ordered fries through UberEats, from another place, those were soggy too. There's a lesson there, but what is it?: All french fries can't travel by car? SOME places' fries can't travel? Or, some places just make soggy fries?]",

My friend ordered the bacon avo burger, which was better but was $8 or so. Probably wouldn't come here again, unless I could catch some of those bargains they advertise on the windows and people have written on here! Not a bad place to try, then!",
