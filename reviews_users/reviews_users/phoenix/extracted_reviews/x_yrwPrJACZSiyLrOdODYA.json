I just got the huevos Rancheros for the first time and though it was great. Going to try the green sauce next time. The only complaint I have is or service was slow. I get that it's busy, but the waitress asked me if I'd like more coffee but then totally forgot. By the time she came around again we were ready to go. At any rate, I really like the decor and feel of this place. I recommend!",

Eggs undercooked (asked for medium well - got really runny whites and yolks). Asked for a biscuit and received cold toast, hash browns and home fries undercooked and lacking seasonings. My Durango burro was boring and wrapped in a huge tortilla that was mushy and just large folds of bland tortilla. In summary- I will be heading somewhere else for breakfast, sorry Bisbee Breakfast Club, maybe I will be back in a year for a retry - or not.",

Since I keep a Torah Observant diet - it is rare to find places that can or will accommodate my simple dietary requirements - which is frustrating.  However, I discovered that Bisbee BC did not hesitate to accommodate my needs and had a great attitude about it.  The menu is easy to use with a good variety of foods to choose from.  I brought my wife in the next day, it was so good!  The food I ordered (corned beef hash and three-cheese omelette) was delicious and well proportioned.  I had to try their potato pancakes (Latkes) since so few restaurants offer them and even fewer are worth having.... their latkes had a wonderful and delightful flavor!  The seasoning was not overdone and the cake was not greasy or heavy... it was light, yet filling.  I really like them !  Nice, bright atmosphere with comfortable chairs and roomy, ie. not cramped or crowded. This place is beautifully designed with the proven, simple, traditional open-kitchen, American Diner concept - with a very nice looooong counter, providing plenty of individual seating (a wonderful tradition that seems to be going out of style).  The wait staff is friendly and efficient.  Ann was delightful and as I said the cooks were please to accommodate my dietary requirements.  The owner, Cathleen, checked on our table and she is positively charming - genuinely interested in pleasing her customers and obviously loves her business.  The Bisbee Breakfast Club diner boasts a very positive atmosphere and great food.... I look forward to trying their lunch menu.  The pastrami sandwich is calling me!",

My wife and I both decided on the Chicken-Fried Steak and Eggs. Eggs were cooked to order, over-easy, and done to perfection! Hash browns were well done too. I had an English muffin and my wife ordered a home-made buttermilk biscuit that was perfectly flaky, buttery and larger than the size of my fist!  The coffee was great, I found myself never wanting for a refill. The whole meal was well prepared, really satisfying as I put a nice Habanero sauce on top to compliment the steak, hash browns and eggs.  Well worth many return visits!",

Nice floors, lighting etc.  The bad?  The short of it = the service was below par.  -Drinks took a long, long time. After being seated by the person who ended up being my waitress, I waited a couple of minutes for her to come back with my drink. A water refill took 3-5 minutes after it was dry and I had to remind her at that point that I also ordered a coke.  -I asked for no tomatoes or onions and both came with my burger.  -Follow-up was lacking. She did not come back to check on my food after delivering it until I was nearly done with my meal (she did get to eat her lunch in the meantime!).  All of this with 2 servers and 5 tables. I really would like for this place to succeed. It's right around the corner from my house and I was pleased with a number of things, but with service like this, its hard to give a good rating.",

The main cook is Mexican and he is also the owner apparently.  He seems to really care about the food going out and  is a nice guy. But I dont feel that he has a grasp on how to fully run a restaurant. The waitstaff hostess and bus people seem unorganized and slow. The cooks helpers seem young and unknowledgable. We were here on a Sat late morning and as we walked in a male customer was at the register upset about his meal. Talking very loudly to the cook/owner about not liking his food, the long wait and the price. The cook/owner didnt seem to know how to respond to the man or how to deflect the situation.  The upset customer was going on for about 10 min. Other customera were disturbed from the commotion.  The owner should have gave him a free meal voucher for next time and sent him on his way. But instead we had to hear this man yelling for 10 min.  Service that day was horrible. We kept having to ask the waitress for coffee,  creamer, water, etc.  I really dont like this place. Just too unorganized and the menu isnt that great. The staff is unorganized. The food is ok. The prices are high for a what you get. Maybe its better during the week. But on the weekend its pure chaos.",

I have  worked in the business for over twenty years and I've learned, better to have great service with two servers than to have mediocre service with one.

Boyfriend and I eat here quite a bit, and generally it's pretty good so didn't mind the wait for order (20 minutes or so).  Food came cold!!!  Cold eggs, cold gravy on both meals.  Food went back and was heated up. Yuk!!!   We ate because we were hungry otherwise we would have walked out and wouldn't have been the only ones.  I watched another couple leave right after their meal was served.  Thanks to owner for 10% off bill, but doubt we will be back..",

I had a side order of biscuits and gravy.  It was a large portion,  the spicy sausage gravy was good. The biscuit was large. Over baked and dry, did not appear to be fresh.  This time  I brought my husband. We each had something different. The waitress was the only one on the floor and there was a waiting list.  The food was just Ok... nothing special.  Very disappointing! !",

    "text": "After searching for a a good mothers day breakfast place, we decided on the Bisbee Breakfast Club.  Its a great looking place, with a clean and modern interior,  And that's part of the problem, it made me expect more out of the food too.  Oh there was nothing wrong with any of our dishes, the eggs and potatoes were cooked and tender, and the coffee was good.  Had we eaten the same food at IHOP or Denny's, we'd be talking  4 stars.    I had the special, called the Brisket Scramble, and it was definitely the best dish.  Pieces of super tender brisket mixed in with egg, cheddar jack and green chilli's, it was very yummy. Here's to hoping that it will become a permanent menu item! It came with a side of very average hash browns, probably because they came pre made and frozen from a bag.  My wife had the Corned Beef Hash and Eggs, and she was not that impressed.  The corned beef was tender and tasty but not shredded, rather it was cut into chunks, The potatoes were cut in huge chunks and very plain, no char or crust.  My daughter had the Eggs Zorba which may have benefited from having mediterranean style olives rather than plan ole black ones.  With so many legendary breakfast places within a mile of this place, they probably need more than just their tastefully decorated dining area to stand out.",

I asked for 4 eggs instead of 3 this time.  Guacamole is zero taste, the eggs don't even taste right and there wasn't a shred of bacon in it either. I can see the cooks preparing hash browns from a box (lame), I opted for cottage cheese after seeing that. I want to like this place, but after 2 attempts and giving the same review, I won't make it back in. Sorry.",

Twice I called several times between 11-1pm on Friday and nobody answered the phone so I could place an order.  That was the last straw - have not gone back.

My daughter ordered a plate called Pancakes Sammy that came with pancakes, eggs and bacon.  They put the eggs and the bacon right on top of the pancakes rather than use a separate plate. Who does that?!  She did not enjoy her flavorless, watery eggs.  She ate the pancakes but said they weren't as good as other restaurants.  I ordered Eggs Zorba which was eggs with onion, tomatoes, spinach and feta. It came with a biscuit and home potatoes. I was sad to see it did not come with bacon which other restaurants include. I paid an extra 3.99 for three slices bacon. That's a bit high.   The eggs were good, I just added a lil salt. The home potatoes had a seasoning on them but were a little greasy tasting. The biscuit was moist. The bacon looked pathetic and tasted greasy.   Our waitress only offered to refill our drinks at the moment we pushed away our plates and were done. A little too late. Other than that she was friendly and took our order promptly and brought our food quickly.   So for 2 breakfast plates @ $8.29 each,  side of bacon $3.99, one water, one OJ $3.00 my bill came to  $25.47. It's a little more expensive than I'd like.  The restaurant is nice and open floor plan. Wood floors, clean appearance.   I don't plan on coming back for breakfast. This was a huge miss for me.",

The coffee is top notch for dinner coffee--nothing fancy, just a great quality of hot joe. I had a side if biscuits and gravy with fruit on my first trip and was quite pleased. I had the potato pancakes today was will never make that mistake again. The potato cakes were akin to soggy hash browns, devoid of the golden brown crispness that one usually thinks of. They were bland and without any character. Avoid them. Whatever you have, get a biscuit on the side. They are huge and easily shareable.  So fluffy, so tender--a tad of butter is all they need to enjoy them. My only other complaint is that the fruit is served in giant slices, which us hard to cut down at the table using the butter knife provded.",

Got the filet and eggs,medium rare, it was so tender I don't think I could have cooked the steak any better myself (I consider myself a grill master).  Also ridiculously reasonably priced for filet only about $12. My only drawback of the meal (and it's mainly my fault because I didn't order them crispy)  was the hash browns I would suggest just getting them extra crispy or well done...and boom! Perfect meal.  Also I sat at the bar and had the greatest service.  On more than one occasion a different employee made sure I was completely satisfied and my main waitress was a sweetheart. (She's the polish lady, so nice and always refilling my coffee) I will definitely be back to this place and I'm going to tell everyone I know about it.",

    "text": "I love the line from Jerry Maguire, \"Help me help you!\"  It's strange how often this line fits the situation, as you would think someone who could use some help would happily accept, but they too often don't.  I think that's what's happening at Bisbee Breakfast Club in Mesa.  The answers to what they need to do differently seem to be recurring in the other reviews over and over, but they aren't changing anything.  I've been there twice now and the results have been the same.  Slow service, tables not getting bussed, not refilling coffees without having to be asked, and food that is generally okay but could be better with a little attention to detail.  My wife and I have been to the original in Bisbee twice and it was so good both times that it was one of the highlights of our trip, so we were totally psyched when we saw this one opening up right next to one of our favorite places (Cornish Pasty.)  We tried it shortly after it opened and it was meh.  I figured they just needed some time to get their sea legs and it would be awesome.  We went back this weekend and it was the same as the last time.  I'm just sticking with a few key points that I hope they notice so we can make some positive moves here:  1.  Buss the tables asap.  Dirty tables look terrible and they take up space that could be holding more customers.  2.  Fill empty coffee mugs.  This one is a big deal.  Every other breakfast place that is competing for the same business is doing this.  3.  When people ask for the bill, bring it as quickly as possible and then after dropping it off, be ready to process their payment soon thereafter.   The last impression is the most important one and if you make someone sit there for 10+ minutes after they have put their card out for payment and they're just sitting staring at their empty coffee that they wish was full... I think you get the point.  4.  If people are waiting at the door and you can't seat them right away, acknowledge them and let them know you will be getting to them as soon as possible.  No explanation needed on that one.   I'm not trying to complain or lecture here.  I usually won't give a bad review.  If I don't like a place I just don't go back, but  I genuinely want this place to do well and I hope they start paying attention to the details that add up to a successful breakfast joint.  The way it is now, I wish I could give 2.5 stars because it is better than 2, but not quite A-Ok.  They for sure have the potential as there are some nice menu items and the overall vibe of the place is good.",

    "text": "I am usually not one to write reviews but in this case I felt the need to. My wife and I are both in the service/hospitality industry and are very understanding of different levels of service. First off, while waiting to be seated there were 4 groups of 2 people waiting (one of which was us) and stood there for about 10 minutes all while no one acknowledged any of us or even made eye contact. One other couple and us were talking about how there was about 6 different tables that were full of dirty dishes from the previous people sitting there and weren't being bussed so we couldn't be seated. We almost just wanted to bus the tables for them. Finally we got seated and our server was pretty fast at taking our order and getting our food to us but she forgot a few things and we had to ask for them. She forgot my husbands coffee, my daughters fruit plate and all of our silverware. The fact that we had to ask for silverware was ridiculous...   There were only 2 servers and 2 cooks, servers had to bus their own tables which made VERY slow service and unhappy employees.   We also noticed another server (a little older than the others and not wearing the same colored shirt) constantly using her hand to completely wipe her nose then proceed to take food and drinks to tables, that's just nasty in my opinion.   No one really smiled until they told us to have a nice day, at that moment they were VERY nice.   Food was ok but service was sub par. Will not be returning.",

    "text": "Wow, this location off Dobson and Guadalupe has been just about every type of restaurant in it's two decade history. I've seen Italian, sandwich shop, more Italian, etc. Now we have a sort-of greasy diner standing in its place, and I hope the Bisbee Breakfast Club is here to stay for a while. With the surging popularity of its neighbor (Cornish Pasty) I can see BBC having some staying power.  The place has a rustic, hipster theme to it- dark hardwood floors, Edison bulb lamps, the whole nine. Whoever designed the interior did a bang up job to be honest. There are only tables (no booths) and they are scattered about- with a nice long dining bar for single patrons to pop a squat (or larger parties if that's their thing).  The menu is succinct, since the restaurant is only open for part of the part (6:00a to 2:05p everyday)- there's basically two sides, a breakfast side and a lunch side. The couple times I visited, I went with the 2 egg breakfast (over medium) with the hashed potatoes, bacon and rye toast. The eggs were cooked very well, bacon was a little greasy and lots of butter on the rye. All items were fresh. I also got to taste the biscuit and gravy, which was wonderful (needs more pepper IMHO). The coffee was good, standard dark roast and they kept the cream coming (you could say I prefer a little coffee with my cream)...  Prices are very reasonable, service was excellent. We didn't wait more than 5 minutes to be seated, get a cup of hot coffee and place our order. The place seemed to draw a good crowd on a weekday, which was nice to see. I drove by on a weekend and it was packed!  A lunch visit is definitely warranted, since breakfast was so tasty.",

Great first impression it's a very large place and just with the service alone I'd go back. Thank you",

My go to orders were either the Copper Queen or the chicken fried steak and husband usually orders the breakfast burrito.  I would say the last 3 times their country gravy has been watered down as if they were running low and diluted it to make it go further.  It's a shame because I loved their gravy.  My steak on this last visit was so tough and dry and the hashbrowns were not fully cooked and not their normal delicious and crispy version.  My husband said they also managed to mess up the green chili,  that usually is so amazing.  I'm not sure if it's a new cook or something going on within the kitchen staff, but we've had terrible meals the last three visits within the last 6 months and will never return after this.",

All of the people that we interacted with were extremely nice, including Emily and the owner. The menu is the normal breakfast fare plus about 50% things I wasn't familiar with.  I tried the potato cakes because my mom made mashed potato pancakes when I was small.  These were made from hash browns, and while I am certain that they were good, I am just not a fan of hash browns in any form.  The rest of the meal was tasty, especially the homemade sausage and the biscuit.  At the end of the meal, the waitress, Emily, noticed that I had not eaten much of the potatoes and inquired if I did not like them.  I explained that at I was trying something different and I had no complaint.  She insisted, to my objections, that she remove the charge from my bill.   When I noted that chili was on the lunch special, but not on the menu, I asked if was a regular offering, they said, just during the cold months.  They suggested that we taste a sample and brought out a small bowl for us to taste.  I will return for the chili soon before they take it off of the menu. This is a great place for breakfast or lunch.  I am sure to be returning many times.",

While you wait, it is frustrating to see un-bussed empty tables and staff making multiple trips to the station to wipe the table, refill condiments, grab one silverware setting at a time. They need dedicated bussers with carts.   Sometimes the staff is on it to get your order and get you in and get you out once you're finally seated; other times you need to wave an arm or make eye contact or catch their attention to let them know you're there, ready to order or that your coffee needs refilled.   Waiting to pay is ridiculous. If a wallet is open, strike right away!  Some staff overtly dodge your gaze--not sure if this is a generational thing or what. I've been going here since they opened and the service has gotten consistently worse. We'll give it a few months before returning.   I hope the restaurant reads these reviews and improves their processes. Hustle and get a move-on. Act like you invited customers to your place to give them great food and get them on their way. People work hard for their money and parting with it is much sweeter if you're a satisfied customer.",

We went opening day and they messed my order up and the servers were in a state of frenzy. I assumed it was because they needed to work out the kinks, so we went back a couple weeks later on a Wed. morning thinking that visiting on a slower day the service would be better. It wasn't. We've gone 6 or 7 times in total hoping that it will live up to it's name and we've been disappointed every time. From servers not refilling coffee, incorrect orders, undercooked food, having to ask for our check at the cashier because our server disappeared after serving the food it seems there are always issues. I'll continue going to the one in Bisbee and Tucson, but the one in Mesa is not even comparable and should not share the same name.",

Needless to say, we wanted to come back! Today, I went back with a party of 6 (last time it was a party of 3). I asked the hostess how long the wait was \"realistically\" going to be since I know the restaurant industry. She said 20-25 minutes. They then proceeded to sit every small party that came after us instead of waiting to put together a 4 top with a 2 top. The wait ended up being an hour and it didn't seem like their was a manager in charge really taking charge of the long wait they had in front of their store, especially since it was Sunday.  I was so bummed out that I couldn't show my family in town this delicious restaurant because of their lack of organization that a restaurant needs.",

I had the corned beef hash - smaller portion (but probably healthier) and massive chunks of corned beef.  I did appreciate that it wasn't inundated with onion that so many other places do.  Hubby had the Bret Omelette and remarked that it was quite full of filling items.  The kid's pancakes are huge - could probably split one order between two little ones.  The other kid had the baked oatmeal which I thought was delicious!  The little one didn't care for the raisins so much.  Their biscuits are huge!  If you are thinking a side of biscuits and gravy - go for one biscuit, I promise.  I really liked the flaky top!

Think they were still figuring out the menu because there was a bit of confusion as to what came with my boyfriends meal. She asked what type of toast he wanted with his breakfast and puzzled he simply replied rye. When our food finally came out all she said was \"Your meal doesn't come with toast\" to him and was on her way. I believe a quality place would have just brought the one slice of rye and said something like \"Actually your meal doesn't normally come with toast but here you go anyway. Enjoy!\" I ordered the corned beef hash. Not my favorite. Not even good. Chunks of meat, not shredded, flavorless hunks of potatoes and greasy overall. I'm not a food critic but I LOVE hash! I always finish or take home my hash. This was the first time in a long time that I left food behind at a restaurant. My boyfriend got a breakfast burrito with unmelted cheese and only a sprinkle of beans on top of the burrito. Both these dishes were marked as specialties. I doubt I'll go back but in time if I do I think I'll keep it simple style and order eggs and bacon next time.",

Their cooks are very skilled in that they cook, answer the phone, serve and what seems they are multi talented. However, the service while polite was terrible. It took a long time to get drinks And food let alone a refill. When I did get a refill on my iced tea, it was tea and no ice. I had to send my eggs back because they were over easy. I ordered over medium. The empty tables sat for a long time and never cleared, by time I needed my bill I waited and waited until I flagged someone down and asked for the bill. Still never came so my husband and I added the bill our selves guessed on the tea cost and taxes. We left the money on the table and left. We will stick with the good egg on Dobson or crackers on  country club.",

I am a restaurant manager and I would love to see them do well. It is refreshing to encourage and support a non-corporation restaurant. It will take some time during their busy days to land on their feet but I hope customers will give them an opportunity to correct the long waits and length of service. I enjoyed the food and the menu had much to offer. Once they work out the kinks and get involved with the community, it will be a winner! Way to go! Keep up the good work and with the right staff you should do well!",

    "text": "Absolutely awful. Huge fan of the original in Bisbee, but beside the menu this visit was a train wreck. After we were sat, a waitress took our drink order (water). Ten minutes later after I had asked for the water another women showed up with water. After another 15 minutes we again had to ask to place our order. Once we got our breakfast we never saw a server again. Our waitress spilled water on a guest behind us and didn't even try to clean it up, but instead yelled at a young bus girl to do it. Another spill in the waitress aisle had a busboy kicking the lemons, straws and napkins under the overflowing bus stand. He then tried mopping around all the items on the floor. We were done 15 minutes before we again had to ask for our check. The only person in the restaurant who was trying to make everything work was our young hostess. She was apologetic and sincere with her thoughts. Also, note to management, take down the Friday night specials board when it's Sunday morning,",

We got seated quickly but did have to wait a few minutes before the waitress came by.  When we finally ordered the food came out at a reasonable amount of time.  This is where it went wrong.  My Corned Beef hash was mediocre at best. Because they didn't have any flavored coffee options I opted for water with my meal.  They need to invest in a filtration system.  It was disgusting tap water!  The other unappealing aspect of my meal was one of the waitress had on what I can only describe as \"booty shorts\"  her apron was longer... In the front!  I didn't enjoy seeing her back end while she was attending the table across from me. Everyone else had long pants... She was unprofessional! Honestly the only thing that I completely enjoyed was the canvas mural of the town of Bisbee on the wall and the adorable glass and galvanized tin light fixtures.  I know they are new.. But they are new to the location not to business!",

I was looking at the posted pictures and I wonder if the health department knows that they place unwrapped foil pats of butter directly on their pancakes and french toast and on small plates in contact with the biscuits.  This is not a very sanitary way to serve these items.  Other places put their butter on little plates. It makes me wonder what other ways they could possibly be contaminating their foods.  See the review of Justina P, dated 7/23/18. I'd rather not risk it, sorry Bisbee Breakfast Club! If I'm wrong, let me know. All the items depicted look great however!",

We discovered this spot about two months ago, and we've been back half-a-dozen times since. We've done breakfast, lunch, and everything in between. (They are open until 2:05 pm.) Our goal is to work our way through the entire menu, though I have returned to the chicken fried steak breakfast.   Today we discovered a not-on-the-menu item, a homemade cinnamon roll. Yum!! We started with that and then split the chicken fried. Plenty of food for two  Speaking of homemade, lots of stuff here is. Biscuits, French toast, buns, and more. Everything is good.  The staff is also awesome! There is a real family feel, and starting with the owner and going through the kitchen, they are welcoming, friendly, helpful, and smiling. They make it fun to come here any time.  There are a lot of good breakfast/lunch spots in the area, and having tried many of them I can say with confidence that this is one of the best!",

After driving by this location several times, I finally made my stop in one morning. Bisbee Breakfast Club actually has a few other locations that are mostly in Tucson. This one opened in 2014 in Mesa next to the popular Cornish Pasty. It's nice to have a bit of that Bisbee southwestern fare close to home. Majority of the recipes here come from the original location. They have all your basic eggs dishes you see at most places, but the spicy south-of-the-border ones are the ones that stand out to me. Durango Burro, Chorizo & Huevos Rancheros are all breakfast entrees that speak my language. They also have some fun popular creations like the Blue Granola or Wally Cakes and the Wingdinger. The portion sizes are pretty generous and prices are average compared to most breakfast places. If breakfast isn't your thing, they have plenty of burger and sandwich options for lunch. Bisbee Breakfast Club tries to recreate the ambience of their original location with a cool steel breakfast bar area, turquoise tiled walls & and a large photo of the old mining town. My server was very welcoming. She knew many of the patrons at the counter so I assume lots of regulars come here. My chorizo rancheros skillet was just the right amount of spice topped with green sauce and a nice potion of avocado slices. It also came with a side of tortillas. Bisbee Breakfast Club Mesa doesn't quite recreate the original but comes close. Service was a little slow (one server) but I'll give them another shot as they are close to home. They also have gluten free options and a weekday breakfast special just over $5.",

Then after ordering the server told us the strawberry lemonade that came with the kids meal was extra. She took it off the bill but she should have disclosed that. Then it took over 30 minutes to get our food. Upon arrival of our food, almost everything was cold. The sausage gravy was tasty but cold and hard like a brick. The pancakes and French toast were both cold and the side of potatoes was minuscule at best, definitely not worth the $3. Overall, the service was slow and cold, and the food was poorly made and cold. So if you plan on freezing your balls off because the A/C is up so hi, and you like disgusting breakfast food, then try Brisbee Breakfast Club. If you fancy tasty food with portions relevant to the cost then search elsewhere. I have had better food in county jail. Yuk on a whole new level. I will never come back to Brisbee Breakfast Club.",

The restaurant wasn't packed, so I was seated promptly.My waitress made her way to my table, brought my coffee and water, and then took my order for corned beef hash and eggs. After 15 minutes, I was finally told that there were a few large tickets ahead of me, and that's why there was a delay in getting my food. it wasn't only be large tickets though, because I could clearly see the cooking station and it would appear to be training going on for 2 to 3 different people at the grill station. After you more on my plate was finally brought to me. I was not served corn beef hash I was there a picture of cooked corned beef with what looked like home fries instead of small chopped potatoes. The hash browns were not a crispy golden brown. They were cooked but they were not crispy golden brown. after I was brought my plate the waitress could notice please see that I was not happy with me. And that is where she made her worst mistake of all, she never came back to ask me how my meal was. and if you're asking yourself \"why did I eat it, why didn't I send it back?\" It's because by that point I was so hungry I didn't want to get up and try something else somewhere else. overall a very lackluster experience, I do not know if I will be willing to give this place a second chance.",

Like the bread had been ever so gently dipped in batter and then cooked out any and all moisture. I could somewhat forgive the cooking style but the totally blandness was the real death to this dish. The worst was the corned beef hash. I hate to sound mean but this was honestly one if the worst things I've tasted in a while. Not only did it taste bad, it was mushy and over peppered. Perhaps I came on a bad day or just ordered the wrong thing. I'm not risking a second chance though.",

The menu isn't particularly inspired, either:  too many meat items, and way too much potato.  I'll try the lunch menu in a few months...if they're still around...and hope for the improvement in service that wasn't evident today.",

We sat at the counter and got a front row seat to the problems they have in the kitchen.  We sat down to the waitress explaining to the two guys next to us that there was a half hour back up on food right now.  While we waited we watched the chef explain that they were out of green sauce and later out of biscuits.  They seemed extremely disorganized and still unsure of how to run a kitchen.  We could tell they were in a rush because the potatoes and eggs were both undercooked.  Gems of the meal were the cornbeef hash and the biscuits (we got one of the last ones). The wait staff seemed untrained and kept forgetting basics like bringing silverware.  Our waitress came to our spot 4 separate times for our drink orders (2 oj's and 2 waters). However, she was very sweet and seemed unphased by the chaos.   If they can get the service and kitchen chaos worked out this will be my new favorite Sunday breakfast spot.",

Met with some friends here for a late breakfast on a recent trip and the place was busy, though the two waitresses they had working for the entire place seemed spread pretty thin between taking orders, clearing tables, seating customers, etc.  As for the food it was a bit above average depending on what you get. They have huge portions for a good price, so you're definitely getting your money's worth and potentially a second meal for later. What was disappointing though is for some reason their sausage gravy is LOADED up with pepper to the point of being labeled as \"spicy\" on the menu. This might float other people's boat but for me if I eat a chicken fried steak or biscuits covered in sausage gravy and taste nothing but an overwhelming amount of pepper, something's gone horribly wrong. Some of their more mild dishes like french toast and omelettes are okay, just seems like they need to work on their seasoning.",

I had ordered a side biscuit and that thing was massive but I found it to be a bit dense and dry for my liking; I slabbed a lot of butter and jelly onto it just to get it down.

However, most people don't share that obsession so it's hard to find restaurants that accommodate, or even worse, they cover them in yucky, stringy, pre shredded cheddar! Blech. These eggs were perfect! I sat at the counter and watched a real deal short order cook create my masterpiece. The hash was fresh ground corned beef that looked like the canned but definitely was not. I loved the fine texture and crisp edges. Everything else I saw the dude make looked amazing. My Bloody Mary was lovely and they made it spicy for me. Cheers! I will be back!!",

Have been to Bisbee many times and always wanted to go to the Breakfast Club but always crowded. They are in the Valley and was happy that I found it.   Great service, awesome food selection and everything is fresh. Had a large scratch biscuit with the Copper Queen Skillet. More than ample portion. The skillet had 2 eggs scrambled with ground bacon, ham, sausage, onions and melty cheese over home fries topped with a spicy sausage gravy. No need to add tobasco. Great balance of flavor and goodness. The hugh freshly made biscuit could have been a meal by itself.  The prices are very reasonable and they have a daily special. Keep this one bookmarked!",

    "text": "Homemade sausage. Homemade sausage. Homemade sausage.  Those are three reasons to eat here.  Here are some more:  It's a breakfast/brunch/lunch joint, with a little more flavor.  What this place lacks is the cheap grease burn that you taste in a lot of places like it.  What does this mean?  It means that the eggs have a rich flavor aura around them, like they were fried on the same griddle as steak.  There's none of that lousy acid-in-your-mouth sensation like you get at a diner.  Ultra high quality.  One breakfast variety includes a shot of scotch with your plate--pricey, but clearly worth the novelty of saying that you tried it.  Great, friendly service here.  And yes, the sausage patties are hand-formed and homemade--not Jones or Jimmy Dean or other pre-packaged garbage.  You really haven't had breakfast in the Valley until you've tried these.  Prove me wrong.",

Again over priced.  The owner of this place Kathleen was really nice. The place is also clean and welcoming. They said hello to those walking in. Very nice.  The menu however has nothing that stands out or makes this place special. The biscuits and gravy are hand scratched. I appreciate homemade to order items. (I'm sure many other items are)  I'm a breakfast lover. I love diners and I also love Chichi modern industrial kitchens but too me it is an overpriced, no - wow factor and forgettable.  Sorry   Aug 2017 - I'm amending my original review and adding a star. I had the French toast and it literally was three huge slices. Not the wimpy toast other places charge a fortune for.  It is shareable. Which means you can have an egg dish and \"cake and eat it too\"   This restaurant has earned my intrigue and now I will be back to see what other surprises await.",

My husband had the Aunt Linda which consists of two eggs, country potatoes, bacon and raisin toast. When were you at breakfast restaurants that offered \"raisin toast?\" Like never!!! Well, they have it here and it was sooo good! We sat at the counter, because it's Saturday at 10:00 AM and this place is packed! There are people waiting for tables. They offer fresh homemade pies. Their Monday through Friday breakfast special is between 6:30-8:00 AM and you get their delicious roasted Bisbee coffee, two eggs, potatoes and toast for $6.79! What a deal! Mandi is our server and WOW is she amazing!! Constantly smiling, checking on us, filling our glasses, and very customer focused! You have to try Bisbee Breakfast Club or you're missing out on fantastic food and great service!",

We drove across town to check it out hoping for some good food. Everything was just your basic greasy spoon diner as far as quality, taste, portions etc.  The Biscuits were from a container, nothing like the hand made ones at the real BBC (Bisbee Breakfast Club). The omelet was small and sparing on the ham/bacon etc, unlike the giant overflowing ones at the real BBC. Coffee was okay. Better than instant, but no where near as good as the locally roasted stuff at the real BBC.  Service was just okay. It was like they were all brand new. I had a hard time getting someone to take my money at the register. One lady walked away and said, someone will be back soon. I thought that was odd. Spending a couple minutes at the register trying to pay when there are a ton of empty tables (In other words they were not busy at all) seemed odd. Not a big deal or major gripe, but just odd.  All and all, we both commented that this was similar to just making some basic breakfast at home with ingredients from the supermarket. I'll stick to Matt's Big Breakfast or somewhere similar from now on.   We both felt that this place must just have only the name licensed from the real BBC since literally nothing food, menu or service wise bore any resemblance to the BBC in Bisbee, AZ.",

    "text": "This was our first experience at the Mesa BBC, and I doubt that we will return. It was just OK food but lacking in much flavor. When a place bills itself as a \"breakfast club\" you expect to be wow-ed by the food, but the comments around the table was more life, \"it was edible.\" The food wasn't as hot as it should have been coming out of the kitchen. I had the corned beef hash, which was proclaimed as being made there and one of their signature items; instead it wasn't much better than the canned product on the grocery store shelves. The home fries lacked any kind of taste and many of the potato chunks were undercooked. The biscuit was pretty good.   Our server was pleasant enough and kept our drinks refilled, but got several of the orders wrong (biscuit instead of toast, home fries instead of hash browns); that's just careless order taking.  There are plenty of better options for breakfast than the Bisbee Breakfast Club. Go elsewhere, my friends.",

BBC is a great addition to the neighborhood and a nice change from the chain breakfast/lunch places we see so often.    If they added mimosas and bloody marys for Sunday brunch, I'd give them 5 stars.",

It was about 75 percent full at peak brunch time so I was a bit concerned right away.  Our server was really nice and sweet and took our order right away.  Then it took what seemed like forever to get some coffee, then it was atleast 20 minutes of waiting for food when we noticed our food was done and just sitting there waiting to be ran.  We asked another server if she could grab it since there were only 2 servers working the whole place.  Surprise...it was cold already. Our coffees were empty.  I don't like to complain so it makes me feel like a jerk to have to keep flagging a waitress down for stuff.  Food was redone so it was actually hot, it came out quickly after she and the cooks had a few words. Pancakes came but we had wait and flag her down to ask for syrup.  She was totally nice but either asked to do too much or just not cut out for waitressing.  The Silver lining is that the food was actually really good but we'll never go back.  There are too many other good options for food to risk another bad experience.  We were there way too long waiting for simple eggs and pancakes.  We were given a discount for our convenience so that was some consolation.",

Their service is NOTHING like the service at this one...theirs is fast and efficient.   The first time I came here, things were good. We were seated quickly because there were no people. Food was really good, but took forever to come. I thought nothing of it and thought that the next time would be better. How wrong I was. The second time let me see how badly this place was run. The restaurant has potential but it's being run to the ground by the manager. At least I think she's the manager. She was the women seating people the two times that I've been there. Has somewhat of a hippy look. She needs to be trained IMMEDIATELY. She's beyond unprofessional and her staff is following suit. The bus boy cleaning tables hated his job. He was so slow doing his job and would throw things around. The waitresses were more interested in conversation with each other than servicing their customers.  We were sitting for a good 10-15 min before someone took our drink order. The \"manager\" told a waitress to get our drinks. The waitress came over to our table hating life and asked \"what do you want to drink?\" There was no smile, how are you, I'm sorry for the wait, nothing. I wouldn't believe what I was seeing.   The food is pretty good, it's a shame that the service is driving people away. I hope something is done soon and they either train the manager or get rid of her altogether. The sooner they correct the issue, the sooner people can return and support a local gem.",

The service was good, the menu had a couple surprises, and my food was delicious. I had the 2 Egg Sammy, I think that's what it was called; 2 eggs, 2 sausages (or strips of bacon), and 2 buttermilk pancakes. My eggs were perfectly cooked. The pancakes were what I like in a pancake; a little chewy, not too cakey. My only disappointments were a lack of Sriracha, and the syrup. It was a fake maple syrup like Log Cabin or something, probably made with corn syrup.  It made me rather sad to desecrate perfectly wonderful pancakes with crappy, fake syrup.  It seems that rarely do breakfast places have real maple syrup these days. I can remedy the lack of Sriracha by bringing my own next time, in my oh so hip Sriracha keychain, but bringing my own syrup seems a more difficult endeavor.   I will most definitely go back. I'd like to try the Potato Cakes breakfast and the Baked Oatmeal. Both of them sounded quite delicious.",

    "text": "We have been to the original Bisbee Breakfast Club in Bisbee and enjoyed the food and service very much, so we were very excited that BBC was expanding to Mesa.  The new Mesa location is decorated with a contemporary, minimalist feel to it.  There's nothing wrong with that, but it is a very different atmosphere from the original.  The wall art painting of Bisbee, AZ was a very nice touch.  Service was eager...maybe a little TOO eager, but I can understand why.  The wait staff came by our table at least 9 times during our meal to ask if we wanted coffee/tea refills.  I mean...we hadn't even taken a sip of the last refill before somebody came by and asked if we wanted more.  Well, the reason for this overzealous concern about our coffee and beverage situation was because the wait staff realized that the kitchen was behind the 8 Ball and that there was going to be a LOOOONNNNGGG wait until we received our meals.  Now, I realize that Sunday morning a few weeks into a Grand Opening is not the best time to try out a breakfast/lunch restaurant, but stupidly, we did.  And we paid for our stupidity with a good, solid hour wait for our meals, which was a rather simple 4-top order of salad, veggie sandwich, pancakes, and biscuits and gravy.  The food was absolutely fine...delicious in fact, but the wait was unsatisfactory.  We kept glancing into the open kitchen to see what was going on back there, and it was obvious that the kitchen staff was either incompetent or overwhelmed.  There were plenty of cooks on hand, so the problem did not appear to be quantity of personnel.  Rather, it seemed that the kitchen folks were inexperienced, and they hadn't found a routine yet.  I'll give them a few months to work the kinks out of the kitchen because the food was delicious and plentiful when it finally arrived, and the service staff was very friendly.  Let's hope they can find their way because the food is outstanding.",

They are indeed that magical. Their pancakes are out of this world delicious, borderlining on illegal. What are you guys putting in that batter? And then the sausage gravy, oh maaaaaan. A couple of bad attitude reviewers mentioned that the gravy was too spicy and I think they are a bunch of boring babies because this gravy is the gravy of champions. Keep up the great work you guys, you make the best breakfast in the world as far as we're concerned!",

The owners/ managers are personally engaged with the patrons and make sure to welcome and greet everyone. The employees and staff are very attentive and genuine in their service. The food is very tasty and the coffee is some of the best coffee I have ever had - anywhere. Highly recommended this establishment.

The harvest omelet was delicious, filled with fresh veggies and topped with Swiss cheese.  I enjoyed the side serving of potatoes that were prepared with onion and green pepper.  The biscuit was huge, but not spectacular.  It would help if they offered more interesting jellies and jams.  My husband loved his chicken fried steak with spicy gravy.  Portions were huge and we both brought leftovers home which were just as good the next day.  All of the servers were genuinely friendly.",

People were waiting, dirty tables sat untouched the entire time we were waiting The only nice part was the hostess who I assume was the manager. It took our waitress another ten minutes to bring us our check.  It was terrible experience.",

Of course my wife had to point at the cob webs in the corners, haha. The wife ordered the colonel, I ordered the copper queen skillet. Got our food at 11:42... 22 minute wait until we ordered. Not bad. We finished our food at 12:00. Got our check at 12:04. Cashed out and left at 12:06. I will be coming back! I like this place.",

Greeted by Devin who asked, \"Hey Boss, where would you like to sit?\", to which I replied, \"Please do not call me Boss, I am not yours\".  After the third time he called me Boss, I reminded him to please not call me that.  Where has all the respect gone?  Whatever happened to Sir and Mam?  Now to a breakfast I was looking forward to.  Growing up in the Midwest, I've had my share of Corned Beef Hash.  What I was served here had a most peculiar taste and was really bad.  Now for the Biscuit and Gravy?  So many red peppers sprinkled on, it was inedible.  Not a place I'll be going back to.",

As for the food, I'm impressed that they sausage patties are from sausage made in house (another European aspect to this place). I had the potato pancakes, which come with apple sauce and sour cream - they were good but would like to see them a bit more crispy, and they come with a breakfast meat (bacon or the aforementioned sausage), along with eggs and then choice of a side carb (I had sourdough toast). One goo thing, the price was reasonable - the breakfast dish, with tax, was about $9 and when you order coffee the waitress comes around on a regular basis to refill it.  Another person in my party got biscuits and gravy and the biscuits are huge and once again, homemade and for the healthier eaters they offer a baked oatmeal that looked interesting and capable of meeting your daily fiber needs in one sitting. My group agreed that this place was worth a return at our next monthly breakfast meeting so thumbs up, way up, for the Bisbee Breakfast Club!",
