    "text": "We ate here today for the first time. The interior is very attractive, light & airy. Our initial server was friendly and helpful. Turns out he didn't have our table, it was another server's. When the other server finally appeared, we ordered a pizza. We wanted 1/2  margherita and 1/2 barbecued chicken. Waiter announced they do not allow people to split orders for pizzas. He said the kitchen staff refused to do splits. So we ordered the margherita.  Imagine our surprise when the pizza ordered by the people seated next to us arrived. Half pepperoni and half margherita. I asked them if their server said they could not place an order like that. They said no, no problem at all. I then asked our server when he reappeared why they could split a pizza and we couldn't. He at first was going to deny that happened, but then he saw their pizza.  He then responded \"They're special\".  Oh, ok. The initial server came by and we let him know what happened. He asked the manager to stop by. The manager was very nice, listened to us and said that should never have happened. Some specialty pizzas cannot be split but what we wanted to do was no problem. He removed the cost of the pizza from the bill, which we appreciated, as we didn't ask for that.  He was very professional.  The pizza was good, very flavorful.  But the server's attitude was not good. Really soured us a bit on the experience. Just goes to show that the public faces of the restaurant are as important as those behind the scene.   We went to No Que No on Scottsdale Rd. thereafter and had caramel filled churros that helped assuage our feelings.",

We absolutely LOVED the Apple & Goat Cheese salad, ingredients were super fresh; absolutely delicious. My wife and I then enjoyed Barbeque Chicken Pizza. Pretty basic, but you can't really mess up a BBQ Pizza, right? All in all the atmosphere of the restaurant as was expected, open concept, trendy fixings, clearly a Fox restaurant done right once again.  Our waitress Taylor was an absolute delight, which is really the reason my wife said \"we need to get on Yelp.\" Fantastic customer service from her. (Thanks Taylor!) We will be back!",

To start the bartender was rarely seen and we were sitting at the bar ...to add to this my friend paid for the bill using her card and I left a cash tip was made very clear to a bar back. Well my friend got her statement and he bartender went out of her way to charge an additional 20 percent tip to the credit charge even though we wrote cash in the tip section of the bill . When my friend called to fix this small problem the manager we talked to was extremely rude saying we were wrong until we got a phone call back ten minutes later admiring their wrong doing. I understand mishaps happen but everyone was very rude when we tried to fix this.   Update : talked to owner and problem was resolved. A promise was made to speak to staff to ensure this does not happen again. Would recommend to friends food and drinks were tasty and reasonably priced!",

    "text": "Our 3rd attempt to eat here was a success! Had to make a reservation through Open Table though because it always had a 45+ min wait when we'd try.  Table of 8, bday dinner with kids and friends. We appreciated the trendy bright decor, open space, and the complimentary valet! Appetizers were the wings and just simply delicious! Very savory and enough for all the adults to share. :)  Pulled pork sandwich, the prime rib dip, half rotisserie chicken and pizza for the kids. Kids ate the pizza but weren't fans of the crust - but kids are kids. Tasted yummy to me!  The coleslaw was more of a salad, guess I'm used to the shredded cabbage. It was good but still too tough? .... not sure if that's the right word though. It's just we know cabbage has a certain after taste and it was pretty prominent. I'll give it another try though. I wasn't a fan of the pita pocket style of sandwich. The pita bread was bland, the prime rib was okay. I can't say that I'd pay $17 for this plate ever again. It just got too soggy from the coleslaw juice and didn't really grab the Au jus like other style of breads.  If I may, one thing that is greatly appreciated by many families with small children is to please at least Offer to bring the kids food out first. I couldn't enjoy my salad because many kids (like mine) get too cranky/restless especially if they're hungry and watching the other adults eat. Even our entrees came out before their tiny pizzas.  I noticed other tables w/children being offered sketch pads too. No one offered our table the option either. So, most likely won't be back with the kids again. I May go back for a happy hour...TBD...",

The chicken and salads that came out to other tables looked so good. The service was fabulous very attentive and friendly made great recommendations. They have a good selection for kids menus. The atmosphere is very cute and trendy and I loved the open concept and feel of it's lots of young families. We live over near Kierland and  are hoping that they will get a location  closer to here or even desert ridge so we don't have to drive so far. But for now it's worth the drive",

    "text": "We have driven by many times but I was a little hesitant to try Doughbird.. Honestly, how much can you really do with rotisserie chicken?   We went on my boyfriend's birthday since we were staying in a hotel that was only ten minutes away. We were seated immediately and were handed menus. I noticed that the menu was fairly small- apps, salads, pizzas and rotisserie.. but there was so much variety!  They offer pizzas for any palette. Their rotisserie chicken comes in half or full and comes with a side and a sauce. There were at least eight sides and about ten sauces to choose from! I am so indecisive; it took me a while to get it all figured out but our server was so understanding.   I settled for the half rotisserie chicken with teriyaki pineapple sauce and a side of Mac and cheese. Their chicken was moist and tender unlike your local grocer's. Their Mac was awesome! My BF ordered the Spiral Ham pizza which was also amazing. They have a chili oil on the table that goes great with their pizza and chicken. I expected the portions to be small but surprisingly they were a good size.   I asked our server if they did anything for birthdays and he informed me that they unfortunately did not. But toward the end while we were waiting for our check, the brought out a dessert to surprise my bf and I was so so grateful. Thanks for the awesome service.   This restaurant is definitely on the more pricey side (as are all Fox concept restaurants) but we left sooo satisfied it was definitely worth every penny. Will be back again soon!",

Actually quite tasty stuff, but the pizza was a bit oily on mine esp since they drizzled (probably fake) truffle oil which was totally unnecessary as the pizza by itself would have been Okay. They did have some healthier options with some stir fries and veggies and all. Service was good.",

The crust is amazing...and since that can kind of make or break a pizza, they are definitely ahead of the game here. My daughter has celiac and it can be really hard to find GOOD GF crusts.  Doughbird's is amazing!  Seriously!  The rotisserie chicken is cooked so perfectly and the dipping sauces are delicious.  My fave is the jalapeno, but the umami is good as well.  The cauliflower mash is my absolute favorite side to the chicken, so you definitely need to try that!  We don't get appetizers all the time but I am so glad we tried some here....the Shishito Pepper app is one of my favorite appetizers of all time.  The dipping sauce that accompanies it is just so stinking good!  I've tried to recreate the shishito pepper recipe at home...while it's good...it's not quite as good as Doughbird's.  I love that you can eat pretty healthy here....if you're not doing carbs but your friend or spouse wants pizza, you can still go and have an amazing meal with lots of options.",

I have also dined at other fox restaurants including blanco tacos, culinary dropout, Zin Burger, north and flower child with all positive experiences.   We ordered the three cheese Stromboli as an appetizer that we never received. The meals came out and we asked about the Stromboli and the waiter said it was being fired? We asked for it to be taken off the check since we had already gotten the meals. I ordered the prime rib sandwich. It was the thinnest prime rib slices I have ever seen on this very thin bread that was more like thin pita and it was $17. My fiance ordered the rotisserie chicken thinking that it was the signature dish. It was tasteless and even with the jalapeno pesto it just was dry and gross.   Other people around us seemed to be happy with their orders so maybe we just got unlucky but because it is 35 minutes from our house and there are 50,000 other Phoenix restaurants we will not be returning.",

Wait for a table was 40 min but there was space available at the bar for two. There appeared to be a lot of servers on shift and they seem to rotate customers based on workload, which is fine and we had no delays at the bar.   The cocktails were very good. I had The Local and my boyfriend had the Gin/Tonic #22. We ordered the half bird and quinoa/tabouleh side with Greek yogurt sauce and Brussel sprout pizza.   Much like other FRC the experience and food is good, not great.",

We were presented with tastings of two alternatives and I fell in love with Dolcetto d'Alba.  Once settled on our bottle of wine, we went with sharing the Chicken & Avocado salad and an Aviator pizza.  If the chicken on the salad is the same as what they serve from rotisserie, then I absolutely recommend it!  It was delicate, moist, fresh and flavorful.  The Aviator pizza was delicious too!  Well prepared and executed!  What set it apart from other fired pizzas was the crust was a bit soft around the edges.  While a prefer a crispier crust, this wasn't a big issue--just presented another style option of pizza for me. Next time, I want to try the Pastrami pizza!!",

Brussel Sprout Pizza: Sounds weird but their expert execution of the unconventional combination with bacon, pistachio and sweet potato puree is genius.

I had the pepperoni and Mozzarella and it was delicious, OK wonderful. The crust was thin but not cracker thin, the pepperoni was about dime size but there was lots of it. I had to ask for cracked pepper but it came fast and overall I really enjoyed the pizza. BUT - for lunch and the area way overpriced - pretentious remember?  My associate was not impressed from the git go and only ordered a house Caesar salad which they did not eat. They used Romain and then only the bottom part where the leaves are like celery. I know, I know, that is how it is supposed to be made but I tried it and would have sent it back, he didn't. The dressing was too heavy and had too much ground up cheese in it making it grainy.   Bottom line - the place is very open, very clean, service is on time and efficient, and the food  seems to be well done. However as I am not a millennial or a Yuppy it just seemed over priced and pretentious to me.   Just for comparison so you know my proclivities - I like Sierra Bonita, Lon's at the Hermosa, and Rosy McAferty's for comparison.  Glad I went once but like the Buck and Rider - never again.",

    "text": "Was excited to try this place and upon viewing the menu was skeptical because there were a lot of items I'm not familiar with since i guess I'm kind of a basic food conisor guy. The pizza and salad we chose was surprisingly very good!  The food here is not anything I would normally eat but I found it to be quite tasty, with great flavours and simply delicious. The one draw back to this place is the noise level. It's way to loud inside to have an enjoyable conversion at your table and as a group we must have said \"what?\", \"what did you say?\" a hundred times. I hope the management does something to manage the noise level when the place is full to capacity like when I was there because the atmosphere and food make this place worthwhile.  I would have given four stars had it not been for the extreme noise that dampened the meal experience.",

I've waited with anticipation for months for this chicken and pizza Fox outfit and I finally got to try it last night. My wife and I shared a half chicken with Chipotle BBQ and Teriyaki Pineapple dipping sauces with Caesar salad, potato wedges and a pepperoni burrata pizza. All of it was top notch delicious.   When we put our name in, they told us it would be an hour wait so we walked a block down the street to The Little Woody to play skeeball while we waited. Twenty minutes later our table was ready, so don't fret if your estimated wait time feels \"too long\".  Cant wait to go back and try more!",

    "text": "Our family celebrated Valentine's day at Doughbird, and I can promise that we will be back.  They had a great dinner for two option that came with a bottle of wine for $75.  We decided to share a whole rotisserie chicken and a pepperoni pizza.  With drinks and tip our total came out to $65, and we had leftovers.    Food Quality: The food was amazing.  The fresh mozzarella came through in the pizza, and I am not sure what spices were in the sauce; however, it was incredible.  The chicken was tender and had a great flavor.    The only negative for the whole experience is that the chicken was a little smaller than we were expecting.  We were anticipating something close to the size of a costco chicken.  The whole chicken cost $24 compared to $5 for Costco, and it was only 75% the size.   Food Quantity We were thrilled with the size of the pizza,but as a I mentioned above the bird was a bit smaller than we were expecting.  I think for future visits we'll stick to the $14 pizza rather than opt for the $24 chicken.  Service All around, I would give the staff 6 stars if I could, but the upper limit is 5. Every member of the staff from the hostess who greeted us, to our waitress, to the young man who delivered our drinks were courteous and friendly.   I would absolutely recommend this place to any of my friends and family.",

The wait time was 40-50 min and since the place is pretty small inside there was no where to stand unless you would want to be outside.    The service was very friendly but the food took 30 min to come out, not kidding. It was very irritating to see a table with 4 people come after us and get their food before us.    The food was very delicious but pricey. I got the margarita pizza which is $15 and my partner got a half rotisserie chicken which is $17. And the cocktails are pretty small and they are $10. So the total came out to $44.    I think this is a good place to try out once in a while but I wouldn't come her all the time.",

    "text": "The concept is simple - great pizza AND chicken under one Sam Fox inspired roof. And, they nail it.   I've dined at doughbird on several occasions and always leave satisfied with the food and experience. The hummus is very tasty and is quickly devoured if shared. I've enjoyed the Aviator pizza, which is basically a meatlover's, adorned with pepperoni, Italian sausage, and bacon. Alternatively, check out the creative Brussel Sprout pizza with sweet potato, and yes, can't forget the bacon. Each pizza creation is loaded with fresh tasting toppings and enough food to share between two people, while also splitting an appetizer.   Then, there's the bird. Rotisserie free range chicken that is served halves or wholes. The meat is juicy and tasty, but it wasn't particularly unique. What really stood out was the selection of sauces - I tried the chipotle bbq and pineapple teriyaki. I thought both were terrific. I need to go back and check out the horseradish creme fraiche, maybe even on the prime rib. Ok, now you've got me hungry again!  Finally, both the salads and desserts were surprisingly good. I would pair the delightful chicken and avocado salad with a meatier pizza for a nice balance. Then, finish it off with the \"Elvis.\" It's a delicious blend of peanut butter, chocolate, banana, and yes, again, candied bacon. It's a dessert that will certainly leave you all shook up...  Bottom line: Doughbird is a neat new addition to the Sam Fax restaurant lineup. Great food and ambience. I was not blown away like I've been at some of his other establishments, but Yay, I'm a fan, nonetheless.",

Big windows, beautiful curtains, wooden tables with comfortable chairs or booths, gray and blue tones all around, with accents of wine bottles and wine holders. It was comfortable and classy!   The menu doesn't leave a whole lot of description for simplistic items such as the ranch chicken salad sandwich, which is something my nana was interested in. When we asked the server she explained that it was shredded chicken, tossed in a ranch dip with bacon, avocado, fontina cheese on a ciabatta bread, served with a choice of fries or coleslaw. Sounded delicious! My aunt and Mom ordered the special of rosemary rotisserie chicken with stuffing, Brussels sprouts and kale while also splitting the prim rib dip sandwich. I too got the prim rib dip sandwich!   The chicken salad sandwich was not shredded it was almost a full chicken breast with random chunks seperated into the salad mix and the bread was too hard, possibly even stale for my nana to eat. She also got the coleslaw which really wasn't coleslaw but rather a small side salad with chunks of cabbage and a sweet dressing.   As for The rotisserie dressing was really dry as well as the stuffing, and the Brussel sprouts were very few.   I will say that the prime rib dip was delicious which is the only thing that saves them 1 Star.   For being as classy and high priced as this place was you would expect there to be better quality of food. It's not a place I would come back to or recommend.",

The restaurant produces some crave-worthy pizzas plus many other dishes.  On my first visit, our party of four split a couple pizzas, the cauliflower and a couple desserts. The pizza was delicious, and we loved dipping the yummy crust in the lemon garlic sauce. Please make that your first choice if you're unsure about which sauce to choose. The cauliflower was pretty good, but I prefer smaller pieces that can boast more charred surface area rather than the larger slices they serve.  I came another time with my sister, and she got the seasonal Thanksgiving plate. She loved every bite and returned with one of her friends the next week.  During our most recent visit with fellow pizza loving friends, we got the cauliflower with mac and cheese on the side with jalapeno pesto. The mac and cheese needed the extra oomph from the pesto, and it was another great dipping sauce for the crust. My husband and friends all agreed the chicken was very tasty.  Wino tip- get the Day zinfandel on their wine list. It's a little pricey due to regular restaurant markup, but it's going to be so much better than the supermarket bottles that sell for $30 but retail for $10.",

To start, we ordered the Heirloom Tomato and Quinoa salad and it was one of my top 5 fav salads ever. I LOVED that it had two dressings - a feta yogurt dressing and a champagne vinaigrette. They went so well together! The salad had sweet heirloom tomatoes, quinoa, olives, pine nuts, and more goodies that were just so tasty. I would get this for a meal with chicken and be the happiest camper.   For dinner, we split the heirloom tomato {apparently we have a thing for heirloom tomatoes} + artichoke pizza and added fennel sausage to it. It was also extremely delicious. I loved the chewy crust! We also split the half bird with cauliflower mash and the umami sauce, horseradish sauce, and jalapeno pesto. Oh man, 3 sauces may have been overkill but I absolutely loved every one of them. The horseradish sauce is SO good on the cauliflower mash.   Of course we couldn't leave without dessert! We ordered the Elvis and practically licked the mason jar. I wasn't super fond of the bacon cookies though. That is just a personal preference.   We will definitely be back. My only complaint is that prices are a bit high. I feel like the pizzas could be reduced by a few bucks to compete with surrounding pizzerias but that is just my two cents! Yet again, Sam Fox knocks it out of the park!",

I've been waiting to try this place and finally we were seated in this beautifully decorated restaurant. The decor is just so inviting.  For starters against my kids wishes I started with the hummus and had to ask for more bread as my kids devoured it. The hummus was delicious and flavorful and the heirloom tomatoes they added complemented the hummus perfectly.  The pizzas we had was the pepperoni and the aviator. Both so yummy. The dough was perfect and crispy and the sauce and ingredients were plentiful. Literally not a piece was left and at this point not a complaint from my boys and trust me they are picky eaters.  Last but not least the chicken and boy as a parent I was grateful that this place has both chicken and pizza. My teenager loved the chicken which was juicy and moist and was being greedy with his brothers and ate most of it himself. And believe me between me and my youngest the Mac and cheese did not stand a chance. We actually ordered more.  Great concept, great service, great food. Until Next year when we return to Arizona.",

    "text": "Being from Philadelphia, the reviews on Yelp and the interior motif of this place gave us a Steven Starr kind of vibe. The food itself didn't give off a Steven Starr vibe, however it was exceptionally good for the area.  Don't get me wrong, the pizza was awesome! We had the pastrami & kale pizza which really delighted our tastebuds. The bread was thin, but not too thin as to fall apart and feel like you're depriving yourself on some sort of restrictive diet-- it was just thin enough to not overwhelm the flavors of the pie with the presence of the bread. Unique combinations of flavors, nothing too daring, but still well thought out pairings that are absolutely not found at your average pizza joint.  The rotisserie chicken we ordered was juicy albeit bland, even though it was all dark meat. For a place that advertises itself as \"pizzeria and rotisserie\", we did expect the chicken to knock our socks off and it didn't really impress. The side sauces we ordered were buffalo and jalapeno pesto-- definitely recommend these both. The pesto was so different in the best way possible.   The macaroni and cheese side was to die for, but I am also a complete sucker for any mac and cheese dish anywhere and will always order without question. I'd like to consider myself a mac & cheese aficionado in that respect. And the mac & cheese here was ON. Oh we also had shishito peppers as an appetizer and they were good (especially dipped in the sauce they came with) but they tasted like the ones we pan sear at home in canola oil and salt, so they weren't uncharted territory so to speak.  The beer selection was limited, but the IPA my SO ordered did not disappoint. The gin & tonic I ordered was done extremely well and they did not skimp on the gin. Respect.  Last and far from least (actually it was the BEST part of our meal) was dessert: The Elvis. Just order it. Do it. We were so full before we ordered it, but it sounded too good not to order and we devoured it in less than 2 minutes and everything was just kind of a blur and I think maybe we blacked out because when it was gone we looked at each other like \"where did the dessert go?\" So yeah. Order that or deprive your sweet (and peanut butter-loving) tooth.   So in final: pizza worth experiencing, underwhelming chicken, good cocktails, great service.  We will for sure be returning here to see what other unique dishes they have to offer and we're looking forward to it. Can't wait to write another review for Doughbird!",

The chicken was by far the better dish. We ordered a pizza with barbecue beef and some kind of spicy pesto and thought it was ok, but nothing special (and the people at Doughbird must have a greed because I don't see it on their menu anymore). The chicken, however, was awesome. Perfectly cooked and juicy. We ordered two sauces- the pineapple teriyaki and the Jamaican jerk.   Both sauces were awesome! For our side, we ordered the mashed potatoes..... these things are insane. They must be incredibly bad for you because they were the creamiest, most buttery mashed potatoes I've had in a long time.....decadently delicious. I would definitely recommend Doughbird!",

We tried Doughbird shortly after it opened and we were very impressed! We were curious as to how much we would like it as the concept of Pizza and Chicken was a bit weird to us. We decided to go as a date night and ordered hummus, pizza, chicken, and a bottle of wine. The hummus, as stated above, blew my mind and was fantastic. The pizza was really good and well cooked with toppings well distributed. The chicken was good but what really makes it are the sides (omg, the brussel sprouts) and the many dipping sauces you can choose from. The wine selection was also good and affordable. Loved the open kitchen concept and I appreciate that this restaurant was built in the \"Arcadia\" style as well. We've gone back multiple times since!",

Both delicious plays on our favorite drinks, and we liked them. We then ordered the crispy chicken potstickers on recommendation. They were good, but the side plate were were given to eat them off of was dirty, so had to wait for a server to come by to get us another one. Which they did, no complaints. We then ordered an Aviator pizza which also came with a dirty side plate, boo. It was wet at least, so we used a napkin to clean it ourselves as no server came by this time for quite awhile. This is when things took a turn.  Staff all seem to really enjoy each other's company. Which is great, laughing, joking, hanging out with each other, all lovely. However, we waited an excruciating amount of time to get recognized that we were done and then double that after we got our bill, to have it picked back up while our credit card sat on the bill for our server to stand holding hands with his friend at the counter and laugh and giggle while we waited. Again. Lovely restaurant, lovely food, lovely staff when being attentive. Just would prefer cleaner dishes and just have the staff look up quickly and recognize when customers need attention or to leave.",

The service was pretty bad but this is what I've come to expect from this family of restaurants. Overworked servers with mediocre work ethics. It didn't upset me since I knew to expect it.   We ordered chicken wings and a Brussels sprout pizza to split. Both were eh.  Federal pizza has a to die for Brussels sprout pizza if that's your thing. Go there and have it instead because this one is disappointing.   The chicken wings were not crispy, greasy and drowning in wing sauce. I've met few wings that I didn't like but these made the list.    I will try this place once more but I won't order those same things again. Maybe it needs some time to get on its feet.

Wait times are understandable for such a new restay, service is good. But the FOOD... Oh my good Lord, the food... Pizza has excellent blend of savory tomato sauce, perfect melted and gooey cheeses and properly proportioned meats. I've tried three pizzas now and I couldn't pick a favorite. They were top notch pizzas, some of my favorites in the valley. Mac and cheese and shishito peppers rounded out the meal nicely. Both being excellent versions of dishes I've had many times.   One final note... Umami sauce. Get it",

    "text": "Came here with my friend to treat her to a birthday dinner. I was excited when I read they had a mushroom pizza because I love mushrooms and love a pizza that is simple. This pizza was a solid 7/10. I do wish there was a little bit of sauce, even if it was a tad bit of white sauce, because the truffle oil became a little too much at one point. Also wish the crush was thicker because it was so weighted down by the toppings, even if the toppings were only mushroom. My friend got the barbeque chicken pizza and we were really surprised when we bit into it and it was spicy. I guess I don't think of a BBQ chicken pizza as spicy (because BBQ sauce is sweet and tangy...?), but to each his own. Also the pizza was very hard to hold. Again, the crust being thin and all you can't really expect anything different from it.  We also got the guacamole, which was awesome! I would never get it again solely because it was $10, but it was sure yummy. One thing I was SO confused about though was the random orange chunks in it? WHO PUTS ORANGES IN GUACAMOLE???? Like I get it but I don't get it. It was one of those things that you're like \"Okay I like this but I actually don't know if I like this\". The chips they made, which you could clearly tell were made in house, were SO GOOD though.  Overall, I liked this place.

I love a place where there's too many good things on the menu to confidently decide what I want to eat. My fiance had the rotisserie chicken and I had the Aviator pizza. This is oddly specific, but they use those small pepperonis where the tops get just a little crispy in the most perfect way...it's delicious! Also the butterscotch dessert was amazing.",

The chicken was super well done and the sauce was really tasty. I was a little disappointed it only came with one sauce cause all of the sauces sounded so good. The fries were tasty as well.

It was good but missing \"something\"...a pistachio or something would really complete it. Regardless, still enjoyed. We also ordered the BBQ chicken pizza. I'm traditionally not a fan of this pizza other places as the sauce often is too sweet. That is NOT the case here. The BBQ sauce is subtle and balanced so nicely with the spicy pesto sauce. The crust was cooked perfectly. We absolutely loved it and look forward to coming back for it again. It was definitely crowded, as expected on a Friday, but we nabbed seats at the bar within about 10 minutes and the service there was great.  Highly recommend!",

We ordered a half chicken, mashed cauliflower, with lemon garlic sauce. It was cooked perfectly, and carved in such a way that made it very easy to eat with fork and knife. The white and dark meat were both moist, skin had lots of flavor, and the portion size was perfect for 2 modest eaters. The ability to add on sides makes it scalable for hungrier folks.

Honestly we were impressed with his skills.   As we were noticing how fast he was standing next to him were two tall slim appeared to be caucasian cooks looking at us laughing and goofing off checking out all the chicks.  First impression I usually would talk to a manager about this and leave,  but I let it go to save our evening.   We ordered a whole chicken 24.00,  a pizza 15.00 and two side salads additional 5.00 with two diet Pepsi's 7.00. Oh and an extra dipping sauce for 1.00.  After the tax and tip we dropped 68.00. The chicken NEEDED the sauce, lovely sauce by the way garlic lemon.   The pizza wasn't any better than Blazed Pizza (Blazed is actually better).  I think it's over priced and definately not worth it, the noise level in the restaurant was pretty ridiculous (especially because they built it this way bad acoustics).  Overall if I was desperately craving rotisserie chicken I would come back, I'll leave the Pizza to Blazed.",

We've been here at least once a month since we've moved out to Phoenix over two years ago, sometimes we come once a week. The homemade ranch dressing is to die for, we always order extra sides of it and dip everything on the table in it. The chicken is always juicy and super flavorful. The pizza is outstanding for Phoenix pizza, the dough is chewy but light and crispy and the toppings are creative. We usually start with the chicken wings which are tangy, delicious and the perfect amount of crispy. The aviator pizza is our go to but we've tried almost all of them. This is one restaurant I highly recommend and has become one of our favorite places to eat at in the area.",

The pizza is good- not the best in town but the sauce and flavors of the ingredients are very similar to pizzeria Bianco. I think their crust though is where there is some opportunity to improve. I would not get pizza there again. However I would go back for the chicken and the salads. The Cesar salad was delicious and so was their garden salad. Cocktails all seemed a little sugary sweet for my taste but I got a large pour of French rose for $12 which was quite reasonable. The decor was very modern but it almost seemed too \"chip and Joanna\" for my taste- complete with fake shiplap and decorative floor tiles. Our waiter was the best waiter I've had in awhile.

The two large brick ovens can be seen from anywhere in the restaurant.  My wife and I decided to get a salad and a pizza to share. While many options looked enticing, we opted for the Garden Chop Salad and the Barbecue Chicken Pizza.  I have had Barbecue Chicken Pizza at many places, but this was easily the most creative and best tasting one I've ever had. I loved that they utilized the tender, juicy rotisserie chicken on the pizza. The sauce was piquant, smoky, and complex. The crust was cooked perfectly. I was sad when the last slice was gone.  The Chop Salad did its best to not be considered an afterthought to this amazing meal. The wide array of ingredients complemented each other surprisingly well. My favorite parts of the salad were the brussels sprouts and the heirloom carrots.   Even though there are many pizza restaurants in the Phoenix area, if we come back to Phoenix we will definitely make sure to visit Doughbird again.",

Ok, cracking jokes isn't my strong suit, but I will say this place was all the buzz on a Saturday night. The wait was 30-45 mins but we managed to grab a spot at the bar... don't be afraid to ask people to slide down a seat to make room as it happen 3 or 4 times to everyone sitting around the wrap-up bar that night.   Walking by other tables I caught a glimpse of some of the delicious items... the pepperoni & variety of pizzas reminded me of my trip to Italy... fresh ingredients & 'delectable' pizzas!!   Started off with the Apple & Goat Cheese Salad, Raven & Geary Margarita, Pepperoni & Mozz Pizza and a few Moscow Mules. We decided to split the Salad and the best thing is that they know that's the plan so they will literally split it for you into 2 plates. That way you get a nice balance. Our seats at the bar gave us a 1st hand look at the work that went into making the salads, sandwiches and more.   The salad was fresh, light, yet filling and a good starter as we waited on the pizza. That part... you know the waiting... took a long time... When it did come, it lived up to the expectation... flavor, dough, sauce and ingredients were all good. Did I want another pizza... yeah (just being greedy at that point, but honestly I wasn't willing to wait that long again.   looking forward to returning. WOuld suggest not bringing the kids as the vibe is more catered to adults... which was a welcomed change up!",

Chicken skin was not crisp which is a loss of star again and pizza crust was burnt. Also: why is ginger ale so hard to find. Service \"Clifford\" amazing. Waiting to give them five stars - maybe next tome! September 2018: First time here!  Lunch with office. I am so jealous that so many good restaurants are near my office but not near my home.... (Chandler).  This is a rotisserie and pizza place and what an amazing experience!  What's different: They serve multiple sauces (flights) for your chicken.    Review: Meals I can personally vouch for (the rest is pictures!)  1) Whole chicken with 1 side.  (They should consider 2 sides since the half comes with only 1 side also.) - chicken was tender and the skin was crispy!  It came cut up so very easy to Eat!   - preferred sauce for me - horseradish Creme fraiche, it was whipped like it should be.  Perfect combination! - buffalo hot sauce was a little more chilies and oil than your typical sauce - so choose carefully. (Person who ordered not a fan of chilies stuck on this teeth). I didn't like it either too oily. - side potatoes wedges cooked well and a lot.  (Perhaps why you only get 1 side)........ * Down side, sprinkled with parm cheese - person who ordered does not eat dairy so a loss on that. - mashed potatoes side - now I make some mean mashed potatoes and then pan fry in chili oil and have to say these were pretty good for restaurant quality by far. * Down side - Under salted  2) prime rib sandwich with Caesar salad. - we ordered a pep pizza for the table which was nice, a little lopsided on ingredients.  Some got lots of cheese and some none at all.  But....along side of my Caesar - a good little starter. - Caesar was very nice, but slightly overdressed for myself. - prime rib beef sandwich was extremely crunchy and a little hard to eat.  But the meat itself was divine! - I am allergic to mushrooms and most places don't use them and look at me sideways when I ask.  This place \"does\" use mushrooms and thank goodness I asked because I could have been VERY sorry.  I told the waitress I only had a little dip - so she didn't worry.  Glad she knew! (I added some of the horseradish sauce and it did the trick to soften the bread!  All in all it was very good!  So far the best rotisserie chicken place I have found, besides my beloved Swiss chalet. Lastly - I was disappointed that we had slow service as it wasn't too busy.  When your on a Work lunch - some speed is important. Note: pizza was ordered as an appetizer for the table but came after food was delivered - guess it take 20 minutes for a pizza so prepare in advance!",

The Heirloom and Watermelon Salad with quinoa, pistachios, and local feta....oh yeah. We had a small baby size pizza and the dough was perfect. We will be back maybe tomorrow.

The bread was a little too thick for my liking. But the chicken itself was fine. It came with a side Cesar salad. Nothing special. Our waitress was helpful in helping us to decide what to order.

However, there are many reasons why I am giving this restaurant only 3 stars. We had a reservation at 6 PM and arrived on time, but waited 15-20 minutes to be seated. In addition, after we ordered our food, our server was not very attentive and our food took 40 minutes to arrive. Go to this restaurant for the good food, but don't go for the atmosphere as it was incredible loud and the service.",

    "text": "This was quite honestly the worst dining experience I have ever had at a decent sit-down restaurant. My ladyfriend and I made a reservation for New Year's eve because they were having what sounded like a lovely three course meal. What ensued was anything but that.  First off, my water glass tasted like vanilla, leading me to suspect a dirty glass. My friend has a gluten sensitivity, so when we ordered hummus for the appetizer, we asked for vegetables on the side instead of just bread. This did not come out, and when the waitress finally came by about 10 minutes later, she did not offer an apology, but shifted blame to the kitchen, saying they forgot to bring it out. After another 10 to 15 minutes we finally got the vegetables.  After another long wait (we were honestly there for over two hours), we finally got our entrees. Only problem was, my entree was the wrong item, and not what I ordered. I ordered a salmon and got some cauliflower dish instead. Again, when I asked the waitress if this was my entree, she said it wasn't and \"they\" brought out the wrong item, again dodging responsibility or blame. They took both of our entrees back while they cooked mine, so that we could eat together. It was after 8PM at this point (we sat down at 7) and we were both quite hungry.  When the correct entrees finally arrived, my salmon was completely raw in the middle. When the waitress asked if everything was alright, and I pointed to the raw center and said \"it's pretty raw,\" she simply retorted, \"I'll let them know it was a little too rare for your liking,\" implying the issue was me being picky rather than the fact that they served me uncooked meat. It was the waitress's refusal to accept any responsibility for the consistently terrible service that motivated me to write this review.  You could say, oh well maybe I had a bad experience because it was NYE, but there is really no excuse. They had a lot of empty tables and the service was lazy and mistake-prone. A manager came over to apologize but I've had better nights out at Waffle House. They messed up literally everything and I will not be back even if they paid me.",

The margarita and the Watermelon daiquiri were both winners...especially in 109 degree weather   We split a BBQ Chicken salad which was great. One of the few salads I've ever eaten where I didn't pick something out of it. For the main course we had the Spiral Ham pizza which was equally excellent to the salad. The pineapple was gold and flavorful and the ham was savory.  Overall just a great experience. Decor was warm--similar to Little Cleo's. A great place for date night or even family night.",

For starter, we had shishito pepper and chicken wings.  Both were delicious! The sauce on the chicken wings are very special and was not too hot.  We had two pizzas, Margarita and Bacon & Eggs, followed with a whole rotisserie chicken.  Pizzas were very very good and the chicken was tender and juicy!  Every item was great!  Then we topped the dinner off with Butter Cake and Peach cobbler.  Sorry to say that we will not order the peach cobbler again.    I must also mention that the service was wonderful!   However, we will definitely come back to Doughbird soon.  Fox Restaurants offer many different style of foods, several are not our favorite, but Doughbird is definitely on top of our list!

I also didn't appreciate how pushy the staff was when it came to asking if I wanted anything else, making suggestions on ordering additional items, asking again if I wanted anything else, asking if I wanted anything from the bar, asking if I'm SURE I don't want anything else, etc etc. I understand it's part of their job, but you CAN go too far.",

The menu was on the smaller side but I like that. Do a few things well, is my motto. The food came it was plated well and was inviting. Wings, pastrami sandwich, Dip, and a pizza. We all ordered separately but all sampled each other's. All of our choices were \"good\" not \"GREAT\". Teetering on the verge of \"Really Good\" just not making it up over the hump. Fear of too much spice may have been a factor. Our service was \"Great\" meeting the Manager both as we arrived and as we left.  The experience was nice enough but the food does not give us enough reasons to return. To be fair, none of us tasted the Chicken.",

The ambiance of great indie music that is at a reasonable volume is almost enough to bring me back again. The food was really good. I had the potstickers and they were to die for! What really sets this restaurant apart from other Fox Restaurant Concepts is the service. Arinn, I believe this is how you spell it (i got it from the receipt), is one of the most kind and attentive servers i've ever had. When I come back I will make sure that she is working that day. She made the trip to Arcadia worth it.",

Being from NYC I am slightly picky about my thin crust pizzas but we will try to put that aside for this review. I am on a lookout for the best pie in Phoenix and have been seeing this place under construction for a while so had to check it out once they threw their doors open.   They have decent options, but a limited selection for vegetarians. On this visit I tried the shishito peppers and mushroom pizza. The peppers were oki but I loved the umami sauce they came with. The pizza was nice the crust was slightly thicker but I actually preferred it as it did not get too soggy. I loved their house made chilli oil not sure if it went well with my pizza but I am sure I could add a kick to the basic margarita . Will come back again to give it a fair chance. Hope they have some daily specials or more veggie options.",

Loads of staff so plenty of attention.Loved the atmosphere, decor and vibe.Lots of room between tables so neighbors aren't in your lap.  Food arrived quickly and we had ordered a bunch of items to try. Truffle cheese stromboli is listed as an appetizer for good reason. It is tiny, maybe 8\" long and 2\" wide at the most. Heavy on truffle oil not real truffle shavings. It was ok but I wouldn't order again.  Brussel sprouts pizza was a nice size, very thin crust, but not a winner for me. The edges of the brussel sprouts were charred so there was a bitter taste. The glazed bacon topping was a surprising yuck for me but my friend enjoyed it. The sweet potato ingredient made for a pasty mouth feel that I found unappetizing but again, my friend was very happy with the pizza in total.  I have no idea where all these reviews on the rotisserie chicken come up with \"crispy skin\"! We ordered a whole chicken, which arrived in cut portions, easy to handle and divvy up between us. The flavor was good, it was evenly cooked but sincerely it was no different than a $6 rotisserie chicken from Costco. And the skin was exactly what you expect to have happen in a rotisserie -tender flavorful well seasoned but certainly not crispy. For $24, although I enjoyed it I wouldn't order it again.  The caramelized cauliflower was the biggest loser. Caramelized? No. Charred? No. Burned beyond eating was more like it. the top was beautiful but the bottom had each floret clumped in burned blobs that were inedible.  The mac and cheese was good but was made with zero love....just pasta in cheese sauce, no cheesy crust from baking. Just a on-the-stove-top average dish.  The peach pie was dry and lifeless -a definite fail. Our server comped us on this because we were so disappointed.  I would still go again but would try different items. I think a second chance is a good idea.",

He offered input on our selections and he was spot on.  My  friend and I split a whole rotisserie chicken with 2 sides, coleslaw and the Caesar, and the Jalapeno Pesto and Umami Sauces.  Chicken was tender and the zippy side sauces added a nice punch.  The coleslaw and salad added a much needed crunchy complement.  We got there as it opened and were seated immediately.  In a matter of minutes the restaurant was hopping.  Our service was nicely paced-and Daniel made our day with his hospitality and charm!  Ask for him- he is something to crow about!",

No detail overlooked, the place to sit and have a bit but also feel like your sitting at the cool kids lunch table. No bad seat in the restaurant, the patio looked great but a mid afternoon visit in June does not permit the use of the patio.   Overall the food was good. We ordered a few items so we could basically have a taste of all parts of the menu. The restaurant boast their pizza and rotisserie chicken.  The pizza was okay, the chicken was outstanding. I got a side of the cauliflower mash and kale and Brussel sprouts both were average. Finally we ordered the pulled BBQ chicken sandwich and it was out of this world tasty. The flavors were so well put together and out performed the pizza by leaps and bounds.  Order the \"local\" cocktail and it was refreshing but lacked a vast amount of flavor. Their beer selection was great.   Service was good, food took a little longer than I expected to come out for a party of three. Again went on before the dinner rush and after the lunch crowd so expected a bit of quicker food to service.   Overall good experience and will defiantly be going back to try a few more items that caught my eye.",

A lot of manufactured beauty that garners clicks but not on anyone's shortlist for real accolades.  The interior and design are superb.  FRC really has a top notch aesthetic.  The staff is very professional and we found our waiter to have a great balance of personality and attentiveness.  The rub is the food.  You know when you go to most Fox restaurants that you aren't going to get anything bold or new; everything will be safe within   current dining trends.  That was certainly the case here.  There was nothing special about the chicken, especially when you consider that it is only a tad better then the Costco chicken that is 1/4 the price.  The pizza was fine but there are so many options now in Phoenix that our pies did nothing to stand out from the pack.  All in all it is at the lower end of the Fox spectrum.  It has all of the 'scene' that you'd expect from the group but the food doesn't merit the fuss.",

I called around 9.30pm, right after closing, and the manager told me that no one else had called reporting illness.  I usually love Fox restaurants but certainly won't be back here.

They also serve pizza here which we will try at another time.  The restaurant is beautiful with indoor and outdoor dining. During the busy dinner hours they have complimentary valet.  We both enjoyed the food but found it to be on the pricey side at $17 for his chicken and $9.00 for my salad. Appetizer was $12.00.  Honey is the \"chicken connoisseur\" of the family and said the chicken was moist both dark and white meat. I wish they had more options as far as chicken goes, but a solid performance.",

    "text": "Working in the restaurant business my standards are a little higher than most, but not unreasonable. The restaurant is know for their chicken and pizza so I expect those dishes to be down pat. They were not. The roasted chicken was average at best. I honestly prefer Costco over here. The breast was dry, the leg was tiny, and the thigh was mushy.  We ordered the sausage pizza as well. We asked for light mushrooms and it seemed they got the order backwards. There was very little sausage and a fair amount of mushrooms. There were 2 pieces or so that didn't have any sausage. The pizza for $15-17 is a bit steep considering it barely constitutes as a personal pizza. We got the roasted potatoes on the side of the chicken and they were mushy and luke warm at best. We asked for mashed potatoes instead. The mashed potatoes came out Luke warm as well and honestly they were pureed where they were closer to potato soup than mashed potatoes. In my opinion mashed potatoes should still at least have some body and texture left. They shouldn't run off your fork.  I don't get what is all the rage. When you specialize in two dishes they should be perfect every time. The chicken and the pizza were average at best. That is the reason for the 2 stars.",

    "text": "Finally made it to Doughbird last week with some coworkers to celebrate my 5 year work anniversary.  We thankfully all agreed to share, so we could taste more than one thing!   We started with the garden chopped salad - incredible.  Such great textures, and that champagne vinaigrette - lovely!    The margherita pizza was also good, but I would've liked the crust to be less done/burnt.  I like ordering this pizza because it's a solid baseline to compare pizza joints.  Prefer the crust of the Parlor or Federal if it was intentionally baked as much as it was (from others' pictures it looks like it was).  The sauce was also on the sweeter side.    The real star, and the reason I cannot wait to return is the chicken.  Going in, I was the least excited about this.  But the skin, the seasoning, and how moist it was blew me away.  We ordered the umami and lemon garlic dipping sauces, and we were all underwhelmed by both, but it wont keep me from coming back and trying different ones next time.",

I had the hummus with tomatoes and Mom had the chicken sandwich. The first thing we tasted was salt, which was a shame because the food seemed really fresh and was presented so beautifully otherwise. We went to the Henry a few days earlier and my salad was so salted I couldn't taste anything else. Awful.",

Very spacious dining area with a nice wood bar that wraps around the kitchen, with plenty of comfortable seats. We sat at the bar for happy hour, 3:00 to 6:00 daily. $3 tap beer, $6 fancy drinks, and $5 house wine. Only 4 beers on tap however. Boo. Only 2 appetizers on the happy hour menu, guac and chips and hummus. We decided to split the sausage and mushroom pizza. It was fine, but not as good as The Nook down the road. The place was busy on this Friday evening and it was fun watching the cooks in action. The food looked good, so might have to try a regular meal in the future.",

She asked if I would like the salad remade. I replied that it was all right; as it was easy to remove them as they were not small pieces.  I continued to enjoy the salad, and much to my amazement, the manager came over with a freshly made salad with no tomatoes! He stated that he wanted to make sure I was completely satisfied with my meal. This is the kind of service that is lacking in restaurants and retail establishments today. Hats off to Doughbird for providing the best customer service in Phoenix! The pizza was also scrumptious!",

The concept of pizza and chicken got me excited because I knew my whole family would be happy with both varieties.   Between the 3 of us, we ordered the BBQ chicken salad, pepperoni and mozzarella pizza and the half bird with a side of mac and cheese and the pineapple teriyaki sauce....um okay, winner winner chicken dinner! This was the perfect dinner for us and exceed our expectations.  Everything, from the portion to the flavors to the taste was on point. I can rave about it all from the pizza dough to the mac and cheese to that pineapple teriyaki sauce!!! A special praise for our waiter, Dylan. He was beyond accommodating and I hope the manager make note that he would be the best person to train the entire staff. We commented on how he had the perfect timing; when to ask us for our order, offering water, bringing plates, checking on our food, clearing our plates, thanking us. He had great comments on the questions I asked, he has the natural ability to be friendly, without being too much or too little.   He nailed it!!!  I love that they gave us a 4th of July discount. They were packed when we left so definitely make a reservation. And...the space, very beautiful.",

We ordered the Grilled Brussel Sprout pizza with the bacon on the side and sweet corn. The pizza was spectacular but what really stood out to me was the flavor and texture of the dough. Super flavorful dough, crisp on the bottom and chewy on top, but not soggy.  She took the leftovers home to her husband who also commented on the quality.

My son and girlfriend live nearby so they were the experts on this visit. Lots of chatter about the pizza. I wanted chicken. So did my daughter. She's also a newbie. We shared the 1/2 chicken. She ordered mac and cheese and cucumber/feta sauce. I had asparagus side dish and lemon garlic sauce. My son had 1/2 chicken. His girlfriend had the pepperoni pizza. She wants us to try it. Pizza was good but lukewarm at best. Asparagus was good, my lemon garlic was amazing. Again, my food was not hot. My daughter ordered a side of mac and cheese. She received French fries (never ordered). They brought the mac and cheese I swear it was nothing more than something I could make at home from a box. At one point, our waiter brought someone over who appeared to be a manager. She approached my son and started apologizing for something. Waiter cut her off mid sentence and she walked away as she was talking to the wrong table. No, sorry about, how are things here. Just an abrupt departure. So sorry she wasn't talking to me, I would have given her an earful about all these issues related to my visit. Chicken was good with sauce. My daughter was sure her chicken was undercooked. And to wrap up the night, my stomach has not the same since my visit. I want to go back but I don't think I can. I love Sauce. My daughter worked at Sauce at the airport. I love several other Sam Fox restaurants. Not sure I can pay for another $70 stomach ache.",

    "text": "There's been a lot of talk among my friends about Dough Bird. Expectations are high because Sam Fox is brilliant and his restaurants are amazingly popular.  This one is, I believe, succeeding early based on his reputation. I just wonder if people will come back? There's nothing really wrong about this place.  The food is good but unremarkable. The service is really good.   Hubby and I arrived at 6:45 on a Saturday with no reservation. The place was hopping and the wait was 40 minutes for a table. They take a cell number to text you when your table is ready, so you could walk around the strip mall, I guess. However, we were very lucky to snag a spot at the bar. A friendly wait person greeted us quickly and brought water, then wine.  I think the option of a carafe of wine is nice rather than buying a whole bottle.  She was back shortly to take our food order -- she hit the right notes of friendly, genuine, and helpful.   I can't describe the food at this point because it took a l-o-n-g time to be served. However, by sitting at the bar, we had an entertaining and educational view of the staff.  Boy, do these folks work hard. They move with efficiency, smile most of the time, and fill in wherever needed.  Any time there was a lull in orders up (maybe twice over the course of 90 minutes), they were refilling ingredients, restocking plates and stretching out more pizza dough.   When our dinner finally arrived, it looked good.  We wanted to try both dough and bird so we got the pepperoni and burrata pizza and the half roasted chicken with the umami sauce and mac &a cheese on the side.  The pizza was quite good -- tiny slices of pepperoni scattered across a 6-slice, thin crust pie. Little dabs of creamy burrata and tomato sauce with a just a tiny bit of spice to give it warmth. I liked it but I didn't love it.  There are much better pizzas in town of that's what you crave. The chicken was nicely roasted but the skin was not as crispy as I would have expected.  They do excellent roasted chicken at Chelsea's Kitchen and that's what I expected. The umami sauce was actually a citrusy (Ponzu?) sauce with nice depth. The mac and cheese was so bland they could have forgotten it and it wouldn't have mattered. We had a lot of leftovers and the server happily boxed it up for us. Our bill was $60-something for 2 including wine but no dessert.  One other note -- the restaurant is very noisy. People were having a good time.  If I was with a group where some wanted pizza and others wanted chicken or salad, this would be a good place. But with all the awesome restaurants in town to choose from, I'm not sure I would make a second visit here. You should go and decide for yourself.",

    "text": "This review is probably contrary to other reviews but the food was amazing had the Lebanese Hummus probably the best I have ever had. The problem is that the pita serving is not enough to fully enjoy the plate. As a matter of fact the waiter suggested an extra serving which we agreed upon then he neglected to input the order. Ok so we all can make mistakes but the food was served and no server provided any type of follow up. As a matter of fact I had to intentionally make eye contact with another server to request the extra serving of pita. The other downer is that there is no happy hour so the pricing was quite expensive for the serving. Ordered a glass of wine which was alright. Overall more than likely the service experience was such a turn off I have no plans to return. If you decide to give them a try I hope your experience is better. Be Humble my friends.",

I have yet to try the chicken, so cannot provide a review of that... Yet... But I am sure I will be back. The pizza was delicious and the pizza crust exceptional. Who would have thought brussel sprouts would be good on pizza? Well, they were not only good, but I would rate as excellent. I had the apple and goat cheese salad and sampled both the brussel sprout pizza and aviator pizza. The aviator is simply the meat lovers pizza and I would rate as good. The brussel sprout pizza has roasted brussel sprouts, melted sweet potato, glazed bacon, smoked mozzarella, pistachio. Would recommend and will certainly return.",

I think that after the fuss of a grand opening and a long time waiting for the new Sam Fox concept, people were packing in but now it's slowing down. I really wasn't impressed at all.  First off, they take over the parking lot at this little shopping center like they are the big elephant in the room when there are other stores and businesses in the area that need parking space as well. Who needs that! And you can't just pull up and park -- you've got to use the valet! That's a needless hassle right there.   When we got in, we were two of us, looking for a booth and we got seated out at a little table in the middle of the room. The lighting is bright and honestly, the place reminds me more of a Denny's than anything. It's NOT a date night place. There were tables everywhere with little kids yelling. The place is too lit up and too noisy to be the kind of cool vibe that I was looking for that night.   I won't comment on the food, because after waiting for service and it didn't come, we got fed up and left. And we won't be back.",

The inside is like a cafeteria and very noisy. The outside patio is just a strip of concrete and the traffic is super loud.  I thought the food selection was poor. The only thing that was halfway decent was the Stromboli.  I ordered chicken BLT and it was terrible. It was basically chicken salad with shredded lettuce. Other people in my group had pizza. The consistency of the sauce and cheese was very poor. Within minutes, the pizza was cold and clammy. Lots of good restaurants in Arcadia. I would be surprised if this one lasts very long",

    "text": "We live in the area and we are always trying new restaurants. You can tell it is a Fox Restaurant Concept, as the restaurant itself reminds me a bit of North (which I love) with the openness of the space and natural light. I loved their booths and their bar. I really liked the use of space and decor- well done!   We went with my in-laws on a Sunday (2 weeks ago) at about 5pm- there was a 30-40 minute wait. You see a lot of families with their kids, which I think is great. The service is great, friendly servers that have good knowledge of the menu.   When it comes to the food- We were not impressed with the food. We ordered two dinner salads, pizza and half chicken with cauliflower mash as the side. It cracks me up that usually they offer cauliflower instead of potatoes because it is supposed to be healthier, but it would had been healthier to have regular potatoes judging by the amount of butter, cheese or whipping cream that the cauliflower had- whatever it had (which was delicious) was very, very heavy, which defeats the purpose. We just had a bite. So, food was ok, nothing to remember. The prices felt particularly high because of the \"blah\" dinner. I honestly wouldn't go back to this particular Fox Concept Restaurant, there are others that we like better with the same prices, but delicious food.",

Not your average wings that's for sure- seasoned and cooked to perfection. Also, we each got pizza. We figured we better try as much as possible. I got the mushroom pizza which was fantastic (I'm allergic to tomatoes so my pizza selection is usually limited) and my gf got the pepperoni which I know she loved. They were both cooked just right and had fresh ingredients. We ended the night with their warmed cake (butterscotch I believe) and that was also pretty good. The only bummer is that it really didn't come out warm- but that minor detail didn't spoil anything for us. It's the great service that really keeps people going to fox's restaurants anyways. From the bussers to hostesses, everyone was very inviting and eager for us to be there. To recap: We will be back and we want to try more chicken next time!",

The pizza was undercooked, sausage truffle pizza had scrambled eggs on it (weird) and zero flavor and pretty sure they forgot the truffle, pepperoni was wayyy too salty. The crust was so bland and had a cardboard texture. Was here with a group and ordered 3 pizzas and a whole bird. The chicken was good, but not at all any better than the rotisserie you can get at Safeway for 5.99. I did like the chili oil on the tables, but to get any out of the bottle, you have to beat the hell out of it. The Stromboli app was actually pretty good and my fave thing we had. Not one person at the table of 7 raved about anything. We all decided it was just \"eh\". Took leftover pizza home to the hubby who ate 2 of the three slices and said he didn't even want the third. Service was great, though.",

Bit into a piece of chicken and nearly choked on a bone in the chicken. This bone was about and an inch and a half long and as wide as a fettuccine noodle. When we told the waitress, she seemed concerned and said she would be back. The manager then comes over and said he was coming to check on us and how things were since the waitress saw a chunk of chicken on the table. (Ummmm.... What?)  The manager then excuses it by saying, \"Well, it is rotiserre chicken.\" He asked if he could take the chicken out the table, he picked it up with his bare hands (gross- half chewed chicken) and walked away. I guess asking for a bone free salad is too ask. He knows all chicken is originally on bones and someone has to remove it right? I give it two stars because the salad seemed pretty fresh.",

The one star is for the chicken soup we had to start which was AMAZING but then the pizza (pepperoni & burrata) and  whole chicken (with corn, mac & cheese, and potato puree) took a long while to arrive and was barely warm to the touch when it did come. Additionally, we did not receive all the chicken pieces we should have received with a whole bird - our tray was short a breast piece, which is my favorite so when my husband ate the only one I was devastated!! We were so hungry we did not immediately say anything to the waitress but as we continued to eat and our food went from barely warm to down right cold in a matter of minutes we had to say something! The manager came over and listened to what we had to say and comped us a dessert but offered no remedy to the fact we were shy chicken we had ordered in the whole bird tray. We were disappointed with the food, the service, and the value for money mostly because we spent over $80 for two people to eat mediocre food...  We love other FRC places and are frequent customers but don't think we will be returning to Doughbird anytime soon! Really disappointed and let down!!!",

    "text": "We had a great time here after stopping by on a whim for an early Saturday dinner. We were quickly sat outside at our request and got to enjoy the perfect weather and sunset. Clifford, our waiter, was great - he was funny, professional and very knowledgeable of the menu. We did not know it, but they had happy hour while we were meaning my Santan IPAs were only 3 bucks a pop. Score!  For our appetizer we ordered the truffled cheese bread and enjoyed that, which was perfect because the restaurant got very busy after we ordered our app and it took a little while to get our pizzas out. The wait was worth it for sure, because my goat cheese and prosciutto pizza was amazing. My fiancee ordered the Brussel sprout pizza which was very unique and it was so good too. We will be back, next time to share a pizza and some chicken. Hopefully during happy hour because I love cheap good beer!",

    "text": "Great local restaurant with the classic Fox feel. Comfortable, clean, and friendly staff. Now that it is less busy you can walk in almost any night of the week, weekends are still reservation friendly though.   Almost everything is delicious. Great apps include the shishito peppers and chicken potstickers; but, you can't really go wrong.   Salads are great to share, split, or enjoy as your entree (be warned of the typical Fox protein serving though). I'd recommend the garden chop for a fresh, filling salad in a light vinaigrette.   Pizzas have a tangy sauce and a great salted crust. My personal favorite is the pepperoni and mozzarella or the aviator (although since they swapped the burrata for mozzarella, the aviator has an edge). I'd also recommend the BBQ Chicken with a spicy jalapeno pesto sauce.   Rotisserie is really the best option for entrees. Most of the others can be passed up for the delicious chicken or prime rib (although don't skip on the cauliflower steak as a great additional side option!). Sides are all delicious for the rotisserie, definitely check out the brussels. And, don't forget about all the sauces! Jalapeno pesto and Umami Sauce are my personal favorites.   Skip the desserts for something better around that area.   Overall, great restaurant with friendly service and great food and drink options!",

Very spacious dining room, great for large groups, with outdoor dining space as well.  Staff is very friendly and helpful, greeted when we came and left, and our server was fantastic in helping us navigate the food and beverage choices.  We ordered family style; 4 Pizza's, 2 rotisserie chicken, side califlour mash, side corn, and 1 kids Cheese pizza.  That more than adequately fed 7 hungry adults and 2 kids!    The pizza creations are very unique, and offer great flavor contrasts, with something to fit likely everyone.  The rotisserie chicken was juicy, and had a very delicious flavor.  In addition you have a choice of dipping sauces, we chose Umami and Buffalo - good balanced sauces to compliment the chicken (or tip - pizza crust!).  Kudos to the bartender for the great drinks.  Was a little hesitant to order the bourbon and bells in fear of the spice, had a good conversation with our server about it  - so had a great old fashioned.  The server came back by later and gave me a Bourbon and Bells to try and thought it was Ana amazing craft, definitely recommend it.",

They have an awesome menu and are pretty much known for their pizzas and chicken served in different ways.   We ordered the tomato & quinoa salad and the pepperoni pizza. The salad was so good!! It had fresh toasted pine nuts and a beautiful yogurt creamy dressing.  I asked for fresh mozzarella for the pepperoni pizza because that's what differs this place from others. When we got the pizza it didn't have any fresh mozzarella. I was disappointed but didn't want to say anything; just let it slide and we enjoyed our pizza. It was more on the salty side.   I give this place a 3/5 mainly because of service. Our server seemed to be a bit annoyed and made us feel uncomfortable.   When we asked for straws for our drinks, it wasn't brought to us until 10 minutes had passed. I hate drinking straight from the cup and to wait that long for straws seemed so utterly unprofessional and tacky.   We also didn't even ask if we wanted to try any desserts and were given the check right away.   The owners of this place also own north Italia and Green House and I know that they have amazing dessert choices and I felt like we were being rushed to get out of there.   It definitely disappointed me because like I said, I was very excited to try this place!",

I finally had the chance to eat here with my brother being in town for the holidays this past weekend.   We sat at the bar because we didn't want to wait for  a table, but also because the bar is huge and looked very inviting. We were greeted by a super nice bartender who took care of us the rest of the night.   We tried their margarita on their cocktail menu, it was absolutely stunning and DELICIOUS.   We ordered their shishito peppers from the appetizer menu which came with a unique sauce called \"umami\". The bartender told us the main ingredients because it was so good.   Next we ordered pizza, we got their barbeque chicken & wild mushroom pizzas.   They were both hands-down the best pizzas I've ever had, which is really saying something! The mushroom pizza had truffle oil on it which added to the savory flavor.   I purchased a gift card for this restaurant to give to friends for Christmas and will absolutely be returning again and again!   Highly recommended.",

After the initial dining experience, I review the pictures that I have taken; and really ponder how I can best convey my dining experience.   Sometimes, my muse appears and I am inspired to write some epic narrative. And sometimes, I just go with \"meh.\"  This particular Fox Concepts restaurant has me teetering. I can't quite grasp the ultimate point of the various offerings of this restaurant.  I ordered the Rotisserie Chicken with Jamaican Marmalade sauce and Sweet Corn.   The corn was a hit. It was sweet, juicy and rich in flavor.  The Jamaican Marmalade sauce didn't do it for me. I like my Jamaican sauce to be spicy, as it should be. I like my marmalade sweet and tangy. However, this particular concoction seemed confused and made no lasting impressions on my palate. To top it all off, the chicken was dry. Dry enough to the point that the meat below the skin surface was near flavorless. I am not sure if this simply stayed out too long under some heat lamp.   But, it just didn't do it for me.  My wife's Aviator Pizza was passable. Although, there are so many more superior options in town compared to this offering. This particular dish was too salty, and the pepperoni was entirely too crispy. Again, it may have been overcooked in the oven. After all, it was a very busy evening.  Overall, it was a good attempt at a mixed concept. But the execution's end result did not quite live up to what we normally expect from this franchise.",

My husband and I really enjoy sitting at the bar so we can watch them cook the food and bring it to us. It felt like we were watching a cooking show! They are very organized and get the food out quickly to the patrons. We will definitely be back again and again!!!",

We started with their shishito peppers  (absolutely favorable) followed with a simple Caesar salad (split + tomatoes added) and their aviator pizza! I recommend this place  %. The staff is incredibly friendly and stop by just enough!",

Its spacious and well lit and has this nice but casual feel to it (if that makes any sense). Came here with one of my friend who is hmm a \"picky eater\" and she even really liked this place. The pizzas and the salads are delicious. The pizza size is great for one person who is hungry or enough to share with a salad or appetizer. One of my friend had the watermelon cocktail and it's the perfect summer drink: lightly sweetened and refreshing.  Have not tried their roast chicken yet but will come back for more.",

    "text": "So my first experience at Doughbird was during their opening week and left much to be desired. However, I later talked with the manager (he couldn't have been more attentive and wonderful) who assured me that my next visit would be different, and to please try them again to restore my confidence and palate in Doughbird and Fox restaurants.   Tonight we went back and our experience was fantastic! We were greeted warmly and seated at a comfortable booth in the middle of the restaurant. Soon thereafter our waiter arrived, got us drinks, and took our orders. We had cesar salads, bread and butter, salmon, chicken with jalapeno pesto and potato wedges, brussel sprouts and kale, and the prime rib dip sandwich with potato wedges. Every single thing we ordered was flawless! The chicken was tender, moist, and full of flavor, the salmon was cooked beautifully, and the prime rib sandwich melted in my mouth; absolutely delicious! This was my first introduction to jalapeno pesto, but now I am quite sure my life has been forever changed because of it! It was a complete turnaround from our previous visit.   My only knock is that the food comes out pretty slowly, so hopefully you enjoy the company you are with. They just opened however, so maybe this will improve with time.   Thanks to the wonderful management and the incredible food I will be back many times to come!",

It isn't fancy and there aren't an overwhelming number of choices.  Basically just a few unique (but nothing crazy) pizzas, salads, and rotisserie chicken.  I tried something from every category and every item was delicious.  There is not a bad choice on the menu and I hope to return soon.",

    "text": "So I've have visited most of the Fox Concept's restaurants in the Valley and when I heard Doughbird opened up, I wanted to give it a try......and I was not impressed.  So I my wife and I wanted to get out and try something new.  I heard about this a while back from a co-worker, so we agreed to give this place a try.  So we stopped by on a Saturday afternoon.  The place wasn't that busy and we were seated pretty quickly.  From that point on, everything was a disappointment, from the lack luster service to the crappy food.  So we sat there for roughly 10 minutes before a waitress said..\"She'll be right with us\"  About another 5 minutes goes by.  She finally comes by.  She took down our drink orders and said \"She'll be back to take our orders\"  My wife and I reviewed the menu, wasn't really impressed, cause they mostly had pizza and chicken, with a few sandwich and salad choices.  If I wanted pizza, I would just go to the other FOX restaurant...North. So we finally flagged down the busboy to let the waitress know we are still waiting for our waters and we are ready to order.  So from first sitting down to ordering it literally took over 25 minutes.  Anyways, we wanted to give the food a chance, cause if the food is great, we can overlook the sh*tty service.  So we came here what they are known for.  We ordered the full rotisserie chicken for 24.00, since half of a chicken was 17.00 (wouldn't make much sense to order the half), we ordered the brussesl sprout with kale for 5.00 and the Prime Rib Dip for 17.00.  So after all that fiasco, the food finally came out........  The rotisserie chicken was cut nicely and looked amazing.  When you bit into it, the chicken was dry and had a weird gaming taste. It definitely didn't taste like the rotisserie chicken's I was used to. and I get them at Frys, Costco, Sprouts, and Whole Foods.  I would much rather eat chicken's from those places than coming back to here, and for 24.00 bucks, you can kiss my a$$.  The prime rib dip sandwich was a disgrace to its name.  It was dry and the sandwich fell apart.  It tastes more like dry roast beef than prime rib. Go to Stockyards or Charlestons or a REAL prime rib sandwich. The potato wedges were bland and cold.  Feel like they were out of the fryer for quite some time.  The side dish, brussels sprouts were decent and flavorful, but for 5 bucks, I'll pass next time.  Overall, what do you want me to say?  24.00 for a rotisserie chicken that you can spend 5.00 bucks at Costco, or 7.00 at Frys, or splurge and get a range free, organic chicken at Whole Foods for 15.00 bucks.  17.00 bucks for a wilted dried up sandwich?  What a joke.  That sandwich will probably go down as one of my worst sandwiches I've ever ate in my life.  Much rather gone to Fry's and get some Boarshead and cheese and made my own damn sandwich.  So combination of crappy service and overpriced chicken, this is a Fox Concept restaurant i will not be going back to.",

    "text": "-hey yelp!-- the name of this restaurant is not Doughbird.    It's Dough Bird. Sorta like calling a Suzanne, Susan. It's not correct.   11/31/2017--  Did the whole she-bang: 1 whole chicken, 2 sides, 2 sauces, Chardonnay...$60 for me, 1 person, that is w/ tip.   The chicken is excellent. There is no way around it, no reason to try and find a way around it; the chicken is excellent.   Sauces: The boys in the band--which is to say the guys behind bar--they like the jalapeno sauce the best -- I thought it was good, nowhere near great. The cream fraiche sauce is just fabulous. Maybe my severe acid reflux has so badly jaded my taste buds that only things with horseradish taste good...?   But I'll tell you this: I think that sauce is terrific!!  Mashed potatoes: somebody somewhere is going to say they've had better mashed potatoes but I'll tell you this much: these are pretty good. And while you're eating these mashed potatoes you can't eat anybody else's mashed potatoes so these these will do just fine.   Note: restaurants nowadays I notice far too frequently people touching their face, their hair, their person, and the first thing you learn in any food handlers situation is that hands! are the number one method of transmission of colds and flu. So it freaks me out when I see people doing touching their person. The restaurants know better, Mgt too, personnel has been instructed better, hell! they had to pass a test just to work there!  Having said that, Dough Bird get a really good grade, nice job, on behalf of the employees PROPERLY following simple food handlers protocol.   I LIKE THIS SPOT. I don't know if it's a good value but it's good food.",

I really wanted to  say thank  you to Hunter and the manger that was there for being so accommodating when we didn't 100% love what we ordered. We tried to just get a box and take it, but not only did the waiter ask if we're wanted something else, but his  boss insisted and had our pizza remade and it was amazing! Generally I don't have a problem requesting something be fixed, but the pizza was not made poorly in the first place, we just didn't know the bbq pizza would be so sweet.

Parking - This place is popular, so carpool with your friends or take a Lyft because parking is sparse. You're going to a cool new hip place, so take some cool new hip transportation while you're at it.   2. Alcohol - I picked the \"Afternoon Tea\". It had peach sake in it! So delicious and I want to drink it again. If you like sake, you'll like this sweet sake cocktail.   3. Food - You've probably read the other reviews but OMG the Brussel Sprout pizza. Get it, savor it, and then wonder why you didn't order two. The cheese Stromboli as an appetizer was sooo delicious but I wouldn't recommend if you're also ordering pizza.   4. Ambience - The interior design in this restaurant took my breath away. All the details from the plates to the seating, to the windows, it's all tasteful and very beautiful to look at while here.   I want to go back to doughbird with my friends and share a chicken! You should grab some friends and head here soon!",

How is this place in business still? Pictured are the leftovers for take-home but thy will not be eaten. If the management is interested in offering pizza, they should dine at the best valley pizzerias then compare it to their product.

    "text": "I've been to Doughbird twice.  I'm usually a Fox Restaurant Concepts fan.  But they missed the mark today.  I, along with two others, had lunch.  I ordered their signature roasted chicken and mashed potatoes.  Sounded good on a cold (as cold as we get in Arizona) winter day.  Unfortunately, my chicken, once I cut into it fully, was bloody and uncooked.  I told the server, she offered to get me another one, but we were already running late and needed to leave.  She told me she was going to let the chef know, because it was unacceptable. I assumed they'd take it off the bill.  I was disappointed and embarased, since my friends paid, that they didn't take the uncooked chicken entree off the bill.  I think when something comes out of the kitchen that bad, you don't charge for it.  I don't know who's call it was to keep the charge in place, but it was the wrong one.  I will go again, but next time, I will make sure the chicken is thoroughly cooked; I would advise you to do the same.",

    "text": "Once again, Sam Fox nails it with Dough Bird. I have yet to go to a Fox Restaurant I didn't like. I'll admit I'm a total fan girl!  My husband and I stopped into Dough Bird on a Thursday night around 7 and the place was packed. But luckily we only had to wait about 10 minutes for a table.  We decided we needed to try the dough and the bird so we got a pizza and a half chicken. The pizza was pepperoni and burrata. It had great flavor and the crust was done perfectly. The pepperoni made it a little greasy but not too bad. It certainly didn't stop us from devouring it. The chicken was delish. Really juicy and the skin was nicely browned. We had the pineapple teriyaki sauce which was awesome. I could eat a whole bunch of that stuff. And for our side we went with the mac and cheese which was super good. I could eat a bunch of that stuff too.   Friendly staff, comfortable atmosphere and great food. You can't go wrong.",

Despite a small hiccup with our wings coming late (Manager kindly took them off our bill) the service was impeccable. However... next time we come, we'll skip the dough and go for the bird. Both of our pizzas were overcooked to the point where the toppings were hard and chewy. The avocado chicken salad was one of the best salads I have ever had. Same with the wings. Ah Mazin!",

We tried the hummus to start and couldn't get over how smooth and silky it was (I usually skip Hummus because it's gritty) The cauliflower mash was tasty and creamy. Also went for the  Margharita pizza; the burata was creamy and yummy, sauce on the pizza is a simple tomato, and the crust, 'The Dough' was some of the best I've had of late. The Rotisserie or 'The Bird' is just as it should be, well seasoned, moist and falling off the bone. We didn't try the prime rib but plan to soon!! Our service was stellar. We can't wait to go back. Enjoy!! It's fantastic!",

The decor is nice, it is bright and has plenty of room. I wasn't sure we would get a seat, as it was of course busy. We walked in and were promptly greeted and asked if we had a reservation, uh oh, no we don't, but that was ok, the hostess found us a nice booth, YAY. We were quickly greeted by our waitress and offered a beverage. She asked if we had dined there before to which we replied no, she then began explaining the menu and answered our questions. We decided to share a salad and a pizza. Normally salads are just that, a salad and nothing to write home about, but not this salad. The rotisserie chicken was moist and flavorful, fresh avocado, the tomatoes were delicious. The pizza had sausage and pepperoni and was big enough for us to share. The sausage and pepperoni were spicy, which was ok but unexpected. The greatest part of the pizza is that dough. It was delicious and addicting.",

Specials were not volunteered or advertised visually before being asked what we want. I like to know what's available in order to make a decision. Shared a chicken Caesar salad, cauliflower mash, and potato wedges. The potatoes were not warm, the cauliflower was bland and the salad was a good Caesar with some rotisserie chicken added. All in all so unremarkable with the flavors. A beautifully trussed open ceiling acts as an amplifier for all the noises in the room. Not pleasant when crowded. I'll likely try again, but not for a while.",

The dining room is comfortable and contemporary.  The service staff is young, energetic and well-trained to properly attend to the customer.  Sam Fox Restaurants are great at attaining the highest level of customer service in their hiring and training.  The combination of pizza and rotisserie chicken is a great concept.  A nice approach is to order both items at your table and share them together.  The side dishes are perfect and the salads are fresh, chrispy and delicious.  The desserts are creative and satisfying.  Prices are a bit high - $17 for a half chicken, $15 for a pizza and $8.25 for a IPA draft beer.  With this price structure we won't be back as often as we would like, but we will return again.",

Didn't get the chance to try the pizza so we went with rotisserie chicken meals.  What really disappointed me at this point was there was no aroma to tease.  You figure a place that makes pizza and has chicken slowly rotating on a spit would make the taste buds perk up, but nada.  Being a fan of Brussel Sprouts I choose that side (I know yuck but I love them if they're done right) with my order but they were pretty much unedible and burned to a crisp.  The bottom line, you will be better off going with the major chain that sells rotisserie chickens for half the price plus you get the option of 2 sides there, but here just 1.  The chicken was lacking in flavor and was not worth the nearly $20 price, so sad to say this is not a place for these taste buds.  Hopefully the pizza is better but I guess I won't be finding out.",

The interior is just stunning. You almost felt that you were by the sea with the light woods, beautiful floor and beadboard walls. The service is very, very good. Our server was just wonderful, knew the menu and was attentive. But the food is just average. After hearing about all of Sam's research on dishes to feature here, I was so disappointed. We started with the Garden Salad. It was fine, but too dry for my liking, thus tasteless. It was mainly vegtables, so at least it was healthy. Then our margarita pizza, half Italian sausag, came out and my first impression was that it tasted like Pomo, another restaurant in the Valley. Just average at best. The spots of fresh mozzarella is nice, but not enough to make this pizza really good. We had dessert, some peach strusel with a very small (not enough) scoop of vanilla ice cream. We won't be back unless friends want to try. Just not worth the drive or wait.",

First let me say that I love the coordination of servers, and tonight Ryan gave a stellar performance. I wish I remembered the staff from previous visits to mention them as well.  Great job, people. I've had the prime rib, rotisserie chicken, and several pizzas including the Burrata, Aviator, Margherita, and Spiral Ham. Being from Chicago, I don't like people messing with my pizza but these are worth it. Not too doughy, not too saucy, not too cheesy. The rotisserie chicken has been moist both times I've had it. I love getting at least three sauces to go with it. The cauliflower mash is awesome. The truffle cheese Stromboli to start with is a great idea....ours was a little small for the price but the flavor was pleasantly surprising. I've also had the wings which you think would be typical, but not at all. They are very worth tasting. We'll be back again for another pitcher of Moon To go along with the smorgasbord.",

    "text": "Listen, if this wasn't a Sam Fox restaurant it would be closed already. My only question is - do we really need a new restaurant that specializes in rotisserie chicken and pizza? If I am gonna get rotisserie chicken I can by a whole bird at Walmart that's pretty darn good for $5.99. Why in Gods name would I want to pay $17 for half a bird and a side and if I am going to pay $16 for a pizza I am going to Grimaldis. I had the prime rib dip for $17. First of all, the portion size of the prime rib was minimal and I got well done prime rib when I specifically asked for medium rare. The sandwich itself didn't taste like the prime rib dips I grew up with in NY. This sandwich was served in a pita pocket and the arugula just gave the sandwich an odd aftertaste. Even if it had tasted good, it would have not been worth the $17 I paid for it which I am sure will go to pay back the money that was spent to buy the land and build this place. If this place makes it then I will be amazed! I think Doughbird will suffer the same fate Modern Steak did.",

    "text": "We went to Dough Bird for the first time on Mother's Day. The food was very good. I had the prime rib which was cooked perfectly accompanied by au jus and horseradish sauce. My wife had a salad with the rotisserie chicken. She said it was very good. Here's where they can improve service. There were 5 of us at the table. The server brought out 2 meals. A couple minutes later the 3rd meal was delivered and a couple minutes later the final 2 meals were delivered. I don't know why restaurant servers don't understand that this creates an uncomfortable situation at the table with the people who get their meals first wondering if they should eat or wait for the others. Please bring all the meals at once. The other thing I observed is the server bringing the dessert, served in a bowl, with his thumb in the bowl. I saw it at our table and at the table next to ours. Not a fan of fingers in my food.",

Husband and son chose a pizza. Hubby had the pastrami pizza and my son had the pepperoni pizza. They both really enjoyed it. My daughter had the BBQ chicken sandwich with a side of mac n cheese. She is very picky with food and she was extremely pleased with her choice. I chose the 1/2 chicken with the lemon & garlic dipping sauce and the asparagus/broccolini side. Chicken was perfect and the dipping sauce was excellent.  It was probably the best chicken I've had in a long time. The broccolini/asparagus was cooked perfect. Finally we split The Elvis for dessert and it was delicious. I definitely would recommend Dough Bird. We had such a wonderful experience today!",

The food was tasty and they carry one of my fave beers on tap, local San tans moon  juice.  Now the reason they get 3 .  I have had many wings in my day, some great and some not worth even mentioning, I've never had $12 wings and then be charged $1 for each dipping sauce (I got 3 cause the wings were naked), in fact McDonalds is the only place I've ever been charged for dipping sauce, they should make that known because I got 2 sauces that came with it, I didn't even eat.  I will chalk that up to the service and a lost star, there were other issues with the service as well, like it took them about 15mins to ask if we were thirsty, and when we got our pizza it was not made how we ordered it.  The food was a bit salty as well, not salty to were it tasted funny, salty as in when we left I needed to drink about a gallon of water so I didn't shrivel up, the additional star lost.  This place seems kid friendly although it wasn't busy so keep that in mind!  Pretty modern but the decor is also cliche, I live in the east valley and drove about 30mins to check this place out, I will not be doing that again, but I may give them a second chance if I'm on that side of town.  And remember this place is a bit pricey so be prepared to spend that bird doe!",

We had to wait almost 1 hour for a table and there must have been 10 tables available. But no one would give a table. Finally we got to try it out and we split a pizza and a ice tea. Then on 7/8/17 I made a reservation for 2 @ 4:45 we arrived and there must have been 15 tables open and within 35 minutes every table was filled with happy and hunger patrons.  I sat at a table looking towards the kitchen and was amazed on how well the waiters and waitresses keep from running into each other. I complimented Martin Granillo the restaurant manager on how his staff had impressed me.  Now on the food review the Free Range Half Chicken was very tasty. I ordered mine with the Greek yogurt feta sauce and my friend had the garlic one and OMG they both were very yummy. I really like this place because it is very family friendly and so is the staff.

A few entree worthy salads one of which I had but the only thing I didn't try was any of the appetizers. Ill bring friends and definitley have the 4 cheese Stromboli. This was a lazy Sunday night dinner but I still wanted to try everything. I had the spiced bourbon cocktail (twice) . They close at 930 but the place was packed at 9. Original plan was grabbing a drink while waiting for a pie but all the food was being prepared on the other side of the bar and I wanted to try everything. Ended up having the apple goat cheese salad. Sipped on my bourbon ancho Reyes combo and had a few slices of the pizzas. Generous portions, the combo could've easily fed two. NIce mixture of crisp apple slices with sliced grape and roasted pecans or almonds. Plenty of non- traditional pizzas to choose from. I had the Asian chicken which was on a bed of cabbage  cilantro and jalapeno.The sauce wasn't heavy but hit the spot. Just a heads up it was a mixture of dark meat and white meat on the pie. Not shocking but different. The pizza variety and cocktails reminded me of The Parlor but with a twist. I'll try out the rotisserie chicken and some of the sandwiches in the near future. The staff was are all very friendly. The hostess even noticed my card fell across the counter and walked all the way around from the front just to pick it up and put it back the in the glass. William was one of the bartenders that covered diners at the bar and definitley was on top of his game. Both managers on staff for the night paid close attention to dishes as they came out and definitley multi tasked dealing with customers and servers. Good meal money well spent!",

We went back on a Saturday for an early dinner at 5. I got the prime rib and he got the goat cheese and prosciutto pizza again. The prime rib was so so good. It was so tender and flavorful. For dessert we got the lemon meringue pie and the warm butterscotch cake- both were delicious but the lemon meringue was the best I've ever had. The cocktails look really good, I'm pregnant so I didn't partake, but I will I'm the future. Service was fast and the restaurant was full by the time we left at 6.",

I love that their menu is small - we always think we want more choices, but most often that's not really the case (think about the last time you had to look at a Cheesecake Factory Menu! Ugh! Wayyyy too many choices!!)  I got the half bird with a side of mac 'n cheese. Mac 'n Cheese tasted homemade. Rotisserie chicken was cooked to perfection. Added a lemon garlic sauce that was to die for.  My friend got one of the pizzas and said it was perfection. We also both split the number one listed dessert - so yummy!  Fox Concepts never disappoints!",

I had the watermelon daiquiri mixed drink. It isn't frozen. Very refreshing. If you are not a fan of tart, stay clear. We ordered The Aviator pizza, half bird with mac n cheese plus and order of potato wedges. And last a watermelon heirloom tomato salad. Every single dish was so flavorful. Plenty leftovers for two people. No room for desert. The Elvis did sounds pretty tempting...but we were stuffed!",

The cauliflower mash was delicious and the margarita pizza with burrata was simple yet tasty with a yummy well done crust.  Their signature sauces were good, but not as spectacular as I imagined.  The shishito peppers were good, but I prefer the same dish at Windsor.  Here's the slight downside beyond the slight disappointment with the sauces- the price of drinks. 4 draft beers cost us $25 which pricy for mid-day happy hour time.  Overall, the service and food are reasons enough to come back.",

We were some of the first people in the restaurant at 11:30am on a Saturday but by the time we left there was a wait for a table. We both ordered drinks; my dad a Kilt Lifter (in a can) and I ordered The Local. Top marks for my drink - I'm not a vodka person but the drink was extremely fresh and not too bitter. We split the Crispy Pastrami pizza and the Prime Rib Dip. They were both fantastic! Our waiter also recommended the Jamaican Jerk Marmalade which complemented the pizza (and the fries, mmm) well.  The whole vibe here is exactly what I expect when I go to an FRC (and having just moved from Scottsdale I believe I've been to most of them): quality, trendy, delicious. Keep it up - and keep 'em coming to Irvine!",

    "text": "As the newest restaurant of the Fox Concepts, Doughbird has a lot of potential. They have really friendly staff and quick service. The environment itself is fantastic too; I loved the vibes and decorations inside the restaurant.   In terms of food, they lived up to the \"Dough\" portion of the name, but could improve upon the \"Bird\" part. The Barbecue Beef pizza was my favorite item from our lunch. They nailed the consistency of the crust, and the corn and cilantro toppings really finished the pizza. They also balanced the sauces (BBQ, pesto & creamy goat cheese) so nothing was overwhelming.   I also enjoyed the Pastrami Sandwich, which looked like a torta. The pastrami was thinly sliced and flavorful -- I added some Jamaican Jerk Marmalade to it, which made it even better!   Finally, the whole chicken was good, but not very consistent. Some pieces were cooked evenly, yet still juicy, but other pieces were still undercooked. Apart from that, they had really zesty sauces to add on top -- I really liked the Jamaican Jerk, but wasn't a fan of the Umami Sauce (it was too citrus-y for me).",

We came on a not so busy Saturday around 4pm in which they were running happy hour so we sat at a high top. We only ordered the wings off the happy hour menu, they were pretty tasty just wish they were fresh. I know it's hard to not prebake or fry wings because it takes longer to make but they just taste so much better. We shared the chicken avocado salad which was AMAZING. I have been craving it since. Between the bacon, the chicken, the avocado there was enough of everything (and a very generous portion). We got the pepperoni and fresh Moz pizza which we also enjoyed. We were so full but just kept eating and eating it was just that great. We will definitely be back to try more of the menu items. Since you can see the whole back counter we did notice some other things weren't fresh. For instance the prime rib dip looked great but it was previously frozen so once again, just misses that freshness taste. We have been to many fox restaurants and haven't noticed that so maybe it's just this one.",

The service was wonderful,  all staff were professional and friendly = 2 Stars.  Sadly, the meals we ate during our 1st visit missed the mark.  My husband was looking forward to their prime rib sandwich.  He was disappointed that it came out very dry, while relatively plentiful,  the meat was overcooked,  laced with fat and gristle.   I had the barbecue chicken pizza.  The pizza looked good,  but it was lukewarm and very very greasy.  The outer crust was good but the inner crust was so soggy it was difficult to eat without using a knife and fork.  The pizza had okay flavor but the whole texture threw me off.  Our daughter had the quarter chicken kids meal.  It came with a very small leg and half thigh with wing attached.  The chicken was good,  she liked the leg portion and the chicken I cut off the thigh.  The wing portion got set aside.  The corn served with the kids meal was alot of broken kernels that resulted in a mush texture she didn't like.  We shared the Elvis parfait and butterscotch cake.  Those were okay,  but not anything we would want to order again.  We may try Doughbird again,  but with so many other options,  it is not likely.",

Super fresh, crunchy greens, and a delicious dressing.  The waitress was kind enough to bring extra plates so that we can share the salad (which was definitely good enough for two).  We also ordered a gluten free pizza, the Prosciutto & Goat Cheese pizza to be exact.  I forgot, while I was eating, that the crust was gluten free.  Baked to perfection and the combination of flavors was a pleasant surprise.  The waitress was very knowledgable and pleasant to deal with, and super attentive.  The atmosphere was nice: no loud music and plenty of natural light (I sometimes have trouble with dark restaurants).  We did not try the rotisserie chicken, but cannot wait to try it as it did look awesome at the table next to us.  I would more than definitely try this place again!",

I cannot wait to go back with my hubs & branch out a bit.   Their pizzas look amazing!   I've been told they have the best gluten free crust!  Can't wait!",

    "text": "The reason I'm giving this place 3 stars is cause we waited about 30 mins to an hour to be seated and it was 7pm. Then we ordered and it took forever another hour so by the time we left it was about 9pm.   We all basically got chicken which I should have got something else so we can try other stuff from the menu. We got the free ranged chicken which comes with a sauce and a side, wish it came with 2 sides. I got mashed potatoes and lemon garlic sauce and a side of broccoli. The chicken skin was sweet which I don't like my food sweet. Also the skin had a lot of seasoning on it. But the inside was good and juicy. Honestly probably could have got a Walmart rotisserie chicken when it's fresh and could have saved so much money.   Next time I would try other stuff like their pizza.   Also for appetizer we got the truffled cheese bread it was  delicious. The sauce was a different type of marinara but it was good. There was about 8 pieces cut into pizza slices.   They do have happy hour.   It's cute inside. There is a bar area to sit at.   Also when you check in they send you a text when your table is ready.   Also if you sign up for emails from them you get $10 off.",

I've been a handful of times to Doughbird and experienced dining in for lunch, dining in for dinner, and also take-out dinner.  Doughbird works for a meal with friends, colleagues, family, or even a date.  It's conveniently located on the southwest corner of Indian School and 44th St. in a strip mall.  Parking can be challenging at busy times.  In addition to pizza and chicken, the salads and sides are delicious!  I'm a fan of the potatoes and the cauliflower as well as the Garden Chop Salad.  Lots of fun sauces too!    Doughbird also offers a great cocktail / drink menu and happy hour prices from 2pm - 5pm daily in the bar.  (I'm a fan of The Local and the Raven & Geary Margarita).  Their kids menu is moderately priced as well and includes pizza, mac & cheese, and 1/4 rotisserie chicken.  What more do you need?  Enjoy!",

Fresh mozzarella, fresh basil that infuses it's bright flavor to the last bite! But what makes. Pizza great, beside it's crust... THE SAUCE! Wow, amazing!  We also tried the wild mushroom with black truffle, it was SO DELICIOUS, Hubby got the aviator, basically a meat pizza! All of them were incredible!  We didn't get the bird, but next time we'll try it! It looked amazing as we could see many dishes coming out of the open kitchen! (Which I love! I could sit at the bar with a glass of wine, or bottle, and watch them cook all day!) Excellent service and experience! A+",

    "text": "I've been here a few times and really like it. I'd call it an upscale family restaurant...but think well-behaved 8-14-year-olds, not crying babies or 2-year-olds. I was there on a date and did see other people there on dates, so don't let the family thing scare you away.  I haven't tried the pizza but of course, it looks good. The Truffled Cheese Bread was delicious but was really expensive for the portion size. I didn't compare the price but we probably could have gotten a small pizza for the same price. I've ordered a few things from time to time which featured Truffle oil. I really don't see what's so special about it. My date just gobbled most of the cheesy bread down and seemed to be in cheese heaven, so actually, I would consider ordering it again.   The BBQ Chicken salad was really delicious. Just the right amount of dressing. I have a pet peeve about too much dressing. The BBQ chicken had a rich smokey flavor and was delicious when it was served and as a leftover.  This is a part of the Fox Concept Restaurant group. I guess the chicken is what makes this more than a pizza place. It's definitely worth trying and you can make a reservation...which makes it easier to go to than some other Fox restaurant choices.     Note: Costco has restaurant cards you can buy for the Fox Concept Restaurants. It's $80 for $100 worth of food. Well worth keeping in your wallet or purse if you like several of their restaurants.",

Told our very nice server we were sharing. Salad arrived on separate plates, generous portion, plenty for two. Fresh greens, crisp apple slices, sliced grapes, delicious. Thin, crusty sausage and mushroom pizza followed. Chewy style crust, slight char, some really nicely glazed mushrooms and tasty sausage. Then came one half rotisserie chicken, which I carved for us. Moist, fresh tasting, quality bird. Came with outstanding crisp potato wedges and the very best pineapple teriyaki sauce we've had. Flavor so intense, it was over the top delicious.  We were full, and had leftovers, but wanted to try the almond Joy trifle dessert. So rich we couldn't finish it. Whipped cream, chocolate, coconut.  Restaurant very well styled. Clean, comfy, modern, unpretentious. Still felt upscale and just a tad trendy. Nicely done. Our server was friendly and efficient. Only criticism...they didn't have to charge $3.50 for bar draw club soda. Cost them about 5 cents. Other than that, healthy, clean, pleasant meal. Wife said it was Delightful! I agree.",

    "text": "Generally speaking, I love getting restaurant gift cards for Christmas.  Particularly locally based restaurants.  But for those of you who know me or read my reviews, you are well aware of my love/hate relationship with Sam Fox.  As I've said in the past, it comes down to three things (1) beautiful spaces, (2) average food, (3) outrageous prices.  So I usually parse my restaurant gift card requests by (politely) asking people to abstain from giving me Fox Restaurant gift cards.  But low and behold my grandmother's gift for Christmas this year was (you guessed it) a Fox gift card.  Welp, I've never been to Doughbird.  And even though I had no plans to visit anytime soon, might as well put the gift card to use.  On the southwest corner of 44th Street and Indian School, Sam Fox's newest invention Doughbird is a space devoted to two seemingly unrelated cuisines.  Pizza and Rotisserie items.  I mean, sure I like both of those things in the abstract.  But why combine these two?  Beats me.  The restaurant is fairly spacious and can probably accommodate upwards of 150 (including the outside patio) at full capacity.  And supposedly its always full here so I decided to come here for an early dinner on a Friday.  Good decision on my part as things began to fill quickly thereafter.  The space, like so many of Sam Fox's creations, is gorgeous.  The blue and white contemporary tiles on the ground invoke memories of the The Henry's setup while the spacious yet elegant main dining room area harkens towards a feel similar to that of Arrogant Butcher and Flower Child.  The one standout setup here is the open kitchen.  Good for me as I sat up the bar to get a front row seat at the beehive of activity as dozens of staff from cooks, to wait staff, to bartenders somehow navigate the chaos.  As I arrived during happy hour, there were drink specials.  And with their Little Bird Sangria half off during happy hour, that seemed like a good place to start.  Slightly more tart than other red sangrias I've had, but not heavy and with just enough alcohol to give it that perfect kick.  For my main dish, I was looking to meld both the dough and the bird.  Surprisingly there aren't many items on their menu that meld both concepts on one dish.  One of the few is the Barbecue Chicken pizza.  And yes, I know California Pizza Kitchen among many others have done some version of this, but I tried Doughbird's version anyway.  Doughbird's uses chicken hot from their own rotisserie, corn, red onion, white cheddar, greens, mozzarella, oregano, tomatoes, and jalapeno pesto on their version.  Its not strictly speaking a Neapolitan style preparation, but its a close approximation.  And quite tasty I will admit.  The pesto brings a slow simmering spice to each bite and the mix of cheeses holds everything together.  I don't really get the corn other than perhaps to add a sweet element, but it didn't do anything for me.  Overall though, a good pizza with a good crust to match.  Lastly, I inquired about dessert.  The waitress up front (without a moments hesitation) told me to order the Almond Joy Trifle.  Chocolate mousse on the bottom, layered with coconut, almond toffee, and topped with whipped cream.  Super rich as you'd imagine and a great combination at that.  I  tried like hell to get pieces of every layer in every bite, but it was a messy proposition.  Maybe serve this in a banana split type setup?  Just a thought.  Otherwise, no complaints about this sweet treat.  Total cost for the food, drink, tax, and tip came to $35.  While not perfect, I will give Sam Fox my initial vote of confidence.  Doughbird is a decent and promising concept.  So okay thanks Grandma, your Christmas gift card was useful after all.  The menu is not revolutionary by any means and the reasons for mixing two unrelated cuisines into one concept is still puzzling to me, but the effort here seems a bit more genuine than some of the other Fox spots.  The space is beautiful, the food is tasty, and the prices are (mostly) fair.  Here's hoping those are the three things I'll be able to associate with future Sam Fox concepts.",

I crave the rotisserie chicken and jalapeno sauce all the time. My husband loves the pizza and salad. For him to eat salad is a big deal, so that's saying a lot! The reason we go, above all, is Hunter. He is the most amazing bartender and server and makes the experience! I would love to see more side options with the chicken. I also miss the original bread that was offered when Doughbird opened. It was less dense. Also, PLEASE bring back the happy hour pizza slice. It was everything!",

If we lived closer it would definitely be a must go to every week.",

    "text": "Doughbird had been on my list for quite some time. Glad I finally got a chance to check it out recently. Visited with our party of four and started off with the guacamole and chips. It was different the way they make it and good, but not a huge fan necessarily. Next time I'd try their hummus. We had some beers and a couple glasses of wine, love their Riesling! I was not in the mood for Pizza but I did order the Margherita as it's a fave of mine and I didn't feel like a salad or cauliflower steak for dinner (vegetarian here). The pizza was good but not great. Apparently I realized that I have become a pizza snob. I like really tasty sauce and amazing cheese all throughout along with a good crust that's not too hard, tasteless or falling apart. Most places don't blow me away with their pizza and I think I'm still looking for the next restaurant that will. Although it was good, to me I was left with too much crust (near the outside of the dough) without sauce or cheese. If I wanted to eat plain dough, I'd do that at home. Overall I will say the BBQ chicken pizza and the Aviator pizza looked freaking amazing! And it smelled great too, but mine was not exactly what I was hoping for. Nevertheless, my gf got a 1/2 chicken w/mac and cheese (yummy mac and cheese) and we finished the night off with the butterscotch cake a la mode. The service was lovely, attentive and I loved the ambiance. Overall I feel I'd go back but probably sit at the bar, order some drinks and take advantage of some appetizers at 1/2 price. It was a nice experience overall.",

    "text": "How do you unapologetically destroy pizza and chicken when those are the two main things you serve?  I used to love doughbird, but service and good quality has gone downhill. When they opened, the burrata and pepperoni was awesome, chicken was fresh, but early on they changed to mozzarella and the chicken (half of what they're supposed to be known for) is so dry and old that it isnt even edible. I think they used to do team service and a manager made sure everything was alright, but now it's literally zero service.  Tonight took the cake, full decline status: - walked in at 8 on a Saturday. Slightly busy, 6-7 open tables. Told hostess we had a party of 2 and she whispered unintelligible and then we just stood there in silence for 5 minutes. - ordered a kid's cheese pizza and Caesar salad with chicken - food took about 15 minutes, pizza was burned and salad had 3 old dry looking pieces of dark meat. Maybe a half teaspoon of dressing and no cheese. It was basically a small bowl of wilted old lettuce. - it took about 7 minutes to make eye contact with the server and ask for a side of dressing, side of park and some white meat. - dressing and cheese added flavor, but this chicken that came out had to be 4 days old. So dry, inedible. - took 15 minutes for server to come back again. The other two tables next to us also looked like they were ready to go 20 minutes ago. - FINALLY got the check and, to add insult to injury, had been charged for 2 sides of chicken. Didn't say a word because we knew she wasn't going to be back any time soon (restaurant was empty at this point).  Better food quality and service at a chain restaurant.  Gonna miss this place. :(",

Our waitress was awesome, and even offered to make us a new pizza when my husband forgot to ask to remove an ingredient from the pizza.  Salads were very flavorful with quite a few good options. I loved the chicken/avocado salad. Pizzas were all good - the crust is almost like a flatbread (thicker and fluffier). Our family shared the following pizza's and loved them all: The Aviator, Prosciutto and Goat Cheese, Margherita, and Brussels Sprout. Only complaint is it all feels a bit overpriced, but we would still come back!",

It was good, but it was just a roasted chicken.  Nothing outstanding.  Not much different than the cooked chicken you get at Costco.  The hummus was good, but also not more than one notch above many others serving hummus.  The mango (?) sauce that comes with the chicken was really good.  But that's about it.  Service was slow but in they're defense they just opened up so there are wrinkles to work out. I won't go back to give Sam Fox more of my money any time soon until it slows down and gets some inspiration for the menu.  Speaking of Sam, doesn't it seem like all his newer restaurants are basically the same?  Thin pizza and salad.  BORING!",

We tried the chili pepper appetizer which was roasted peppers and 1 out of 10 were supposed to be spicy, but we never did get one.  They come with a sauce to dip in.  I'd recommend an Open Table reservation if you're planning on trying this anytime soon, people that came in to wait on a table were waiting quite awhile.  They also have bar seating if you want to walk in and sit there.  Worth a try!!",

The waiter recommended the umami sauce for dipping. It wasn't a bad recommendation since the umami sauce had a very mild flavor.  My wife had a Garden Chop salad with rotisserie chicken. She was pleased with the taste.  Our waiter was prompt with service. For being only open a few days he had a lot of thoughts on the menu and was very aware of us and his other tables; he checked back in frequently, even asking how I liked his dipping sauce recommendation.   Parking is a sparse; when we went they had a no charge valet there. It's an open space with nice visual accents. How does the ceiling float over the bar?  The only issue I have the point out is the metal dishware. It feels cheap to eat off of, sounds tiney when it hits the table or slides around, and reminds me of grade school service trays. If I'm eating a $16 pizza I'd like proper tableware. Overall we'll be back.",

    "text": "Typical Fox restaurant, right down to where the hostess says \"how is your day going?\" three paces away from the host stand. Fox Restaurants are generally good, rarely great, but with a nice atmosphere and efficient service.   Doughbird is none of those things. The atmosphere is like a cafeteria. Or maybe a daycare center. During each of my three visits (lunch and dinner, both early and late) there were kids everywhere and messes on the ground. Apparently the Arcadia Mom's Club has decided this is the clubhouse.  That'd be OK with me and I wouldn't fault the restaurant much, aside from the mess, if the prices weren't so out of line with what they're serving and the service you get. Service was once too fast, twice way too slow, and dinner for two with a couple of drinks will easily reach $100. Not the price to pay when it sounds and feels like a school lunch room. The food is ok (but again, not great). Creative woodfired pizzas that don't stand out from the abundance of woodfired pizza places in town.  I will admit the rotisserie produces delicious but expensive chicken and prime rib--$24 for a chicken, and way more than that for the beef.  I'd recommend this place if you're in a group where the kids outnumber the adults and you want some decent food and a drink while not worrying about the racket your kids are making. I'd not recommend this place if you're adults, no kids, looking for a more mature dining experience commensurate with the price.",

Don't get me wrong the half bird was good but, it wasn't amazing, I also got the cauliflower mash (which was really good) but cold! And for the price? Eh. My husband got the chicken Cesar salad and at $14 I thought it would be a decent size position but it was on the smaller side. My daughter got the kids cheese pizza and of course she loved it (you can't really go wrong with pizza).   Despite the let down of amazing food and pocket grabbing check the restaurant is super cute, no detail was left untouched. I love how you can see your food getting made and the openness is very inviting. My favorite is the tile throughout!",

The Mac and cheese was really good. Creamy and it taste just right.   Boyfriend had the half bird and fries. He said the seasoning to the chicken was perfect and the skin was the best part.   Margherita pizza with good. You can't mess up a perfect cheese pizza with basil on top. It was delicious! I asked for the black truffle sauce on the side to dip my pizza in. It taste even better!!!!

When I first heard about it, I was speculating as to what I should expect from a place that serves chicken and pizza. Now I totally understand; they go so well together when shared with friends. I love how when I sit at the bar I can watch all of the pizzas being made from scratch and you can really notice how much detail and care they put into each one. The noice level is nothing that will get in the way of a nice dinner, and service is fast and servers are very friendly. Well worth the price as well, the prime rib is to die for.

Pizzas (we tried a traditional pepperoni and one loaded with meat toppings) were tasty, albeit a little overdone for our taste.  Overall a good experience and good service. Our wings were delayed but the manager did a great job in making it up to us. Plus they ended up tasting bomb and the dipping sauce was amazing too.

    "text": "Doughbird does it right! I'm glad to have been able to try the latest and greatest Sam Fox concept this past Friday. The interior is reminiscent of the Fox's other locations, most similarly North and The Yard. Luckily we got there early enough to grab a seat at the bar for some Happy Hour.   I ordered The Local {strawberry | arcadia grapefruit vodka | lemon} as my first cocktail and it was just the perfect amount of tart and refreshing.  My friend ordered the Bourbon & Bells {buffalo trace bourbon | smashed bell pepper | clover honey | ancho reyes poblano | lemon} the drink was perfectly balanced with the spiciness of the peppers with the sweetness of the honey.   The bartender recommended we start with the Lebanese hummus, served with heirloom tomatoes and hearth bread. The hearth bread is actually the same as what they use for the pizza crust and it was perfectly soft and warm. The hummus itself was smooth and creamy. The tomatoes acidity added a great flavor making this probably one of my favorite hummus appetizers I've had lately.   We decided to order way too much food and also got the Bacon & Truffled egg pizza and half a rotisserie chicken. The chicken comes with a side and a sauce.  We got the cauliflower mash and two sauces: horseradish creme fraiche and the Jamaican jerk marmalade. My favorite was the horseradish, perfectly spicy and creamy. The Jamaican marmalade was wonderful as well. The cauliflower mash inspired me to make my own at home- but I still see myself coming back for more here!   The pizza was stellar, as expected. It was basically a breakfast pizza with the bacon and egg. The truffle oil wasn't too heavy or overwhelming like it can be sometimes. If I didn't show some self-control I would have eaten the whole thing!   I was very surprised at how great everything was considering this is a newer spot, but they seem to have worked out any kinks and I look forward to many more visits!",

We sat at the bar, which was great given the 40 minute wait for a table (yes, it's THAT popular even in the summer!). It seems like an ok place to bring very young children, but doable. Great for a date, family time or for a group of friends, although I'm not sure they could seat large parties easily (I suppose you should call in advance!). I recommend this place if you are looking for something new to try in Arcadia!",

    "text": "Doughbird Restaurant serves mostly Rotisserie Free Range plump Chickens and Organic Pizzas. They also offer appetizers, salads, sandwiches, oven roasted fish, prime ribs and side orders. They offer a full bar and have indoor and outdoor seating. The decor looks similar to the decor our local Ikea Store sells...Looks sort of Farmhouse Swedish with Retro Touches to me.  We started with the Truffle Cheese Stromboli.($12.00 +$1) It had a crusty crisp crust and was stuffed with oozing Truffle laced Italian Cheeses. It was molten yumminess. We added the tomato sauce for $1.00 more but it wasn't needed and took away from the truffle and cheese flavors. Also the sauce was served ice cold. It was like stepping out of a warm bed and jumping into a cold shower....I didn't think it went well together but the Stromboli was delicious on it's own.  We went with the whole chicken because value wise it made sense. (at this time 1/2 was $17 and whole was $24.) Either the 1/2 or whole chicken comes with one side and one sauce so we added an extra sauce ($1. ) and one extra side ($5.)  The Chicken is pretty darn good!.......but mine wasn't served not as warm as it should be.  The chicken is very meaty and moist with just the right seasonings. A whole chicken is a lot of food here and could be enough for four people but you don't get enough sides for four people........  We tried the Jalapeno pesto and the Spicy Buffalo Sauce....Both sauces were good but the Buffalo was really Delicious and mustardy and maybe apple vinegar. It was just really good!   Non-Traditional Quinoa Tabbouleh was made with these amazing tasting tomatoes....that were so sweet and fresh tasting.   The Macaroni and Cheese is good and tasted like macaroni with melted American Cheese to me. Sort of like a childhood Grilled Cheese sandwich.  I got a bunch of my order packed up and I saved room for dessert.  Tried the Butterscotch Cream Cake. It was topped with Vanilla Gelato that was loaded with Vanilla Beans. A cake that reminded me of corn cake sat in a pool of butterscotch. It wasn't too sweet and was just right. It was delicious all together.  At the time of this review this is a newly opened restaurant..for the most part things went well.   ....Everything I tried was Delicious!",

The hummus appetizer was decent, but only one pita for four people? Not nearly enough. The chicken wings weren't bad to start. The roast chicken (which I was greatly looking forward to) was bland and no better than something from Fry's or Safeway. No crisp on the skin at all, and not that moist either. Sauces were a big miss for me as well. The pizza was sold as thin crust and came with about a 2\" crust all around. It was fair. I wouldn't seek this place out sadly... as I actually love the other Fox Concept dining establishments. Kick it up a notch and I'll return.",

The pizza was good but it wasn't the best... I thought it was a little soggy & not crisp enough, you had to literally use both hands to keep the toppings on, but the taste was great. Also, I'm more of a wine person, but the cocktails were great!",

First impression of the inside was awesome, it has a very welcoming and homey feel and cool set up outside with firepits and a modern look. We were seated immediately and greeted by our server Arvand who was very polite and attentive, refilling our drinks like clockwork and multiple, multiple times which I've never had happen outside of a fancy steakhouses.  We both had the cream soda which was by far the best I've had, they apparently use a combination of Stevia and cane sugar and it just tastes amazing. For our entree we split half a rotisserie chicken and got the wild mushroom pizza at the recommendation of Arvand as we we're between that and the margherita. We got a side of potato wedges and two sauces (comes with one sauce included, additional sauces are $1) with the chicken, a lemon garlic sauce and a Jamaican jerk sauce. Lemon garlic was good and a classic sauce for chicken, but the Jamaican jerk was even better with a sort of sweet and spicy taste. The chicken itself was fine, nothing to write home about. The pizza was so good, literally. I would go back just for that mushroom pizza (well and the cream soda). In the future, I'd come back for the pizza but the chicken isn't that special unfortunately.",

Delightfully not over-salty. The sides and sauces offer a range of choices. My negatives are first the noisiness; sounds seem sharpened as they bounce around the room. Second, the priciness; this is primarily a family type place, but much to expensive to bring the kids. I liked the cleanliness and quality of service. I certainly suggest you try this place.",

    "text": "We finally had a chance to stop by Doughbird last night (Monday) for dinner, after hearing much buzz around town. We love all of the other Fox Restaurants, so we had high hopes for this one - and they didn't disappoint!   *First bonus - They take reservations. *Second bonus - We had no trouble finding parking at all. We didn't even need valet. Perhaps it's different on a Saturday, but I would recommend trying to go mid-week, if you can!  *Third bonus (most important to me) - They were wonderful with my food allergies. I called ahead of time AND spoke with the waiter when we first arrived, and I had no trouble finding gluten-free and dairy-free options, outside of just gluten-free pizza.  I ordered the wood-fired \"Rocky Free Range Rotisserie Chicken\" and got to choose a sauce and a side. The waiter was really helpful in finding a side that was gluten-free and dairy-free, and made sure to double check with the kitchen if he didn't know. I ordered the \"Jamaican Jerk Marmalade\" and the \"Crispy Potato Wedges.\" The chicken was cooked perfectly, and the sauce was a great accompaniment! The only think I would recommend is perhaps they bake/fry the potatoes a little longer, as they weren't crispy.  Nonetheless, the meal was delicious! My dining partner ordered the Bacon and Truffled Eggs Pizza and ate the whole thing - it was THAT good!   Final word? Food was awesome, atmosphere was on point, and the staff was super friendly and accommodating. I would definitely recommend Doughbird to all of my #glutenfree friends and acquaintances in the Phoenix/Scottsdale area. I know it can be far for those who live in Scottsdale, but it's worth getting outside of your bubble for establishments like Doughbird.  Gluten-free, dairy-free friendly restaurant that offers us more than 1 option for dinner? YES please!",

In fact they have happy hour on Saturdays as well! Huge perk! We love sitting at the bar for happy hour. I usually order a gin and tonic and their absolutely ah-mazing hummus and hearth bread!!! The bread alone is like crack..it's so good and you can't put it down. You will need to order another if you're going to share this dish :)   Their rotisserie chicken is also scrumptious. You can get a half or whole, and it's also an ingredient in many of their salads and other dishes. Perfection. For vegetarians, they do have an amazing cauliflower steak as well. So many options.   Now their pizzas are also really yummy. I just think there are sooooo many places for really good pizza so it's hard to turn down the chicken at Doughbird. Still if you're in the mood for pizza and find yourself in a group go for it! Honestly can't go wrong with really anything on their menu!!",

Doughbird's billboard has been taunting me for months while driving down Indian School Rd so I finally stopped in to try them.  I informed the bartender that this was my first time visiting and asked for suggestions on both an appetizer and pizza.  For an appetizer, he suggested the Crispy Chicken Pot Stickers.  So I went with the pot stickers.  Dude!  They were beyond good.  Unlike any other Pot Stickers I've had before.  Our bartender favored both The Aviator and The Barbecue Chicken Pizza so we tried both.   The Aviator pizza was soooo good.  I loved the crispiness of the bacon and the flavors of the Italian Sausages but My goodness .. the BBQ chicken pizza exceeded my expectations.  It taste NOTHING like any BBQ chicken I've had before.  You could taste every ingredient (rotisserie chicken, charred corn, red onion, jalapeno pesto, white cheddar) in every single bite.   The suggestions were so on point..The service was excellent.  The food exceeded expectations. Everything that'll make me comeback",

I arrived at 1:30 PM and sat at the bar. The restaurant was not very busy, there was no wait list. I was front row in front of the kitchen. It was fun watching the friendly staff prepare pizzas and use the fire brick oven.   I sipped on a Little Bird Sangria while I waited for the appetizer to arrive. My drink was delightful! A red sangria with fresh fruit. My appetizer, truffle cheese bread, arrived and looked as good as it tasted. House made bread topped with ricotta, provolone and fontina with a side of red sauce. The cheese was golden brown and the bread was firm yet delicate at the same time.   Just when I think it couldn't get any better, it did! Lunch arrived! Half Rotisserie Chicken with Mac and Cheese and Brussels Sprouts. Ordering chicken comes with one side, but I couldn't resist. I had to get two. The chicken was tender, juicy and flavorful. The pasta in the Mac and Cheese was not overcooked and the cheese sauce was yummy. The Brussels sprouts were glazed and oven roasted, so freakin' good! I ordered Jalapeno Pesto sauce with my Chicken, it complimented the meal perfectly.    There are other sauce choices:  Chipoltle Barbecue  Lemon and Roasted Garlic  House Ranch  Unami Sauce  Spicy Buffalo Sauce  Pineapple Teriyaki  Horseradish Creme Fraiche",

I went with the way the chef recommended (I guessed that the chef would know!) and it was delicious!! Just the right amount of rawness inside the perfectly cooked outer layer. I also had a slice of the Wild Mushroom pizza (the hubby wasn't going to eat that whole thing!), which was also delicious.

A loosely packed graham crust, an ample layer of smooth, lemon filling topped by a generous amount of the airiest, not-too-sweet, fluff of meringue. Not sticky chewy meringue - this is a culinary chemical masterpiece!  We did not eat dessert first and so I can also vouch for the delicious prime rib and the great patience of our server as we specified our tolerance for marbling and pink.   Personally, I'll give the Brussel sprouts a pass but the rich and creamy mashed cauliflower is enough to convince a skeptic that cauliflower can hold its own.  As for cocktails: one of the best gin and tonic's around - a perfumey base with  hints of lime and mint. Super refreshing!",

She had a nice Caesar salad side and I had the potato wedges.  Everything was very good.  We returned for some pepperoni pizza and buffalo chicken wings. Great pizza and wings were crispy, hot and super flaky. The cut celery and carrots and additional parmigiana cheese and mustard seed added a nice touch.",

If any restaurant fails to provide that, regardless of the food's quality, we just won't come back.  Doughbird is one of those restaurants that falls in my good food and good service category.  First, you have to get past the name.  At first, I scratched my head as to the meaning but after going in, it all made sense.  We had their roasted chicken and found it quite delectable.  However, it wasn't as moist as Wildfish (Hence the 4 star rating).  We also found the appetizers quite tasty as well.  However, the service was actually good. Our server was attentive and made sure we were satisfied with everything we had.    We will definitely return to try the pizza.",

My husband and I didn't have plans for dinner and by the time we decided to give Doughbird a try it was to late for reservations. So I suggest making plans ahead of time because we waited about an hour. But hey it was worth it! First we started with their Truffled Cheese Bread - ricotta, provolone, fontina, simple red sauce. Then we shared their Buffilo Wings and their Barbeque Chicken - charred corn, red onion, jalapeno pesto, cilantro, chicken and white cheddar. I think this was the best way to try their pizza and their chicken. Great combination of toppings. Everything complimented each other nicely. We really enjoyed ourselves here and I am looking forward to coming back! AND MAKING RESERVATIONS! HAHA",

Ordered a salad to split, wings as an app, pizza for me ,half a bird for the Beau and a side of mac and cheese because I've been wanting a really good mac and cheese but can't seem to find one....they were nice enough to separately plate the salad for us but the wings showed up before it. Waited about half an hour before they finally said something about burning the pizza so they left us kinda staring into space wondering what was taking so long with the food and watching people that arrived after us leave. They brought out the chicken and explained but a new pizza followed right behind so I'm thinking they just avoided us til they had food to set down. Manager was super nice and whole meal was comped without us complaining or even asking which was nice and appreciated but I would have much rather just heard what was going on as a courtesy. Beau said chicken tasted like chicken, was nothing spectacular and he wouldnt be back which I guess sucks for me if I want to try something else on the menu. Mac and cheese reminded me of Velveeta stuff and the pizza was decent. If I go back it will be for salad, wings and something new to go because even tho I liked the overall decor it was super loud....like at a club or bar loud and we couldn't hear each other that well so that's why we weren't talking much and staring off looking for food. Which is by no means the staffs fault but it's just not something I was expecting with my dinner.",

You just can't keep churning out concept after concept and not think that at some point its not going to live up to expectations...well Doughbird...YOU ROCK!  Now this is a artisan pizza place with rotisserie chicken as the two main players.  Me and the wife had the stromboli appetizer.  Its a 3 cheese stromboli it was fantastic!  A simple albeit small calzone-like dish.  A little pricey but tasted very good!  We had the mushroom pizza and that was freakin' awesome!!  Crust was light and airy the mushrooms actually tasted like mushrooms, very fresh!!  It also had arugula as well as truffle oil...wow what a great pizza!  We also tried the side dish of asparagus and broccolini and even that was a great side dish.  Needless to say we will be back to try other dishes sich as the prime rib dip and the pizza with pastrami.  The wife did get dessert which was the peach pie with vanilla gelato and she throughly enjoyed that.  It has oats as a topping and it was very delicious!  That wraps up this review so if you're in the Arcadia area near 44th and Indian School stop by however fair warning, make reservations since this is a new concept and in a very popular area.  And oh, the service was EXCELLENT!!!  Conner was our server and he was unbelievably fantastic!!!!!  Can't wait until next time",

The large room is noisy - a little too noisy for us. We had to raise our voices to be heard across the small table. We both wanted to take pizza home so we over-ordered and got to try a few things. NOTE: we only had the gluten-free crust due to a food allergy. The GF pizza crust was very good. We ordered the mushroom pizza which was excellent and the Brussels Sprouts pizza which was okay. We also ordered the caramelized cauliflower with small salads. So... The pizza came before the salads, then the cauliflower, then the salads. Our server, who had been nice and helpful, stopped coming to our table about that time. The Caesar salads were excellent. The pizza - especially for GF - was hot and good. The Brussel sprouts were fairly raw - I expected them to be,  at least, browned a bit. We were never checked with once we got our food, we were never offered a second drink, we had to flag down the hostess for water. We sat for a long time waiting for our plates to be cleared - a long time. The restaurant had emptied by the time we (finally) got our check, but it was still noisy. I would probably go back especially if with a person who had to eat gluten-free. But I wont be rushing back.",

    "text": "I really wanted to like Doughbird, but it was really just \"okay\".  My waiter told me I could not go wrong with the chicken or the pizza, so I ordered both.  I was worried a half chicken would be way too much food, but I was surprised when the half chicken seemed small (especially for $17).  The chicken was good (juicy and not too salty) but not better than roast chicken at other places for less money. But, the chicken included a side.  The roasted Brussels sprouts and kale were delicious, except half were warm on the outside and ice cold on the inside.  Were they frozen going on to the grill?  Being a little underwhelmed I tried the Margherita Pizza.  It looked great but I found the sauce to be almost tasteless.  Maybe it was subtly seasoned? A second piece did not improve my opinion.  Overall I was very disappointed. Perhaps I caught them on an off night.  I give them an A for atmosphere and a C for taste and value.",

    "text": "Ok, just had dinner and I was pleasantly surprised. I had the 1/2 chicken special that they donate $2 to St Mary's food bank. Chicken was good and juicy and they paired it with sage dressing and cranberry sauce. Very good. Not too fond of the Brussels sprouts, if they're too charred, they tend to become bitter on the char. But it was an enjoyable meal. Husband had a pizza with too much salty meat...almost too salty for him. Probably best to get a pizza with maybe a vegetable and meat, instead of all salty meat. But cheese was good and crust was yummy. Glad they had a 6 and an 8 oz wine pour. 6oz is \"standard pour\" but the 8 oz is more like you'd poor at home. 6 oz not enough, 12 oz(2 glasses) maybe too much. I'm appreciative that a friend gave me a $25.00 fox gift certificate, otherwise it would have been a little too expensive. So a gift certificate would be a great gift idea for Xmas. Not sure we would spend so much money to eat there often, but nice for something special. Nice atmosphere and good service.",

Had two different varieties as well as appetizers; nothing disappointed.  Service very attentive, even when crowded.  One weird observation: this is the third restaurant in the last month that I have ordered a \"vodka tonic with a squeeze of lime\" and received a vodka with lime juice (tastes like limeade with a kick).  Even the manager cam over to explain how the bartender makes them.  WRONG!  It's simple; vodka, club soda, squeeze a lime wedge and leave it on the rim of the glass.  From now on I'm asking for a vodka soda with a lime wedge on the side.",

It's a newer restaurant so I get they're still working things out, but we had a reservation and still had to wait 15 minutes past our reservation time (on a Thursday) and then it was at least a half hour wait for our food once we ordered. The waitress kept telling us it was about to come out and then it would be another 10 minutes each time. When our food finally did come out the pizzas were cold. They remade my pizza but there was no offer of compensation for the massive wait to then be delivered cold food. The pizza (once hot) was really phenomenal and the only reason I'm giving it 4 instead of 3 stars.",

The place has a great decor.  The staff was friendly.  The place was not very busy as we ate around 430pm on a Saturday.  The food took a long time to get out.  This is especially tough as we have two small kids.  When the food came it was all cold.  I think they forgot about us and our food.  We didn't have time to send it back as we had already been there 45 minutes with kids.  I would have to say the roasted chicken and pizza were slightly above average.  I will probably just stick with LGO for this combo.  Doughbird is kind of pricey for what you get as the other reviewers have stated.  I love Sam Fox restaurants, but will stick with our other favorites like North and the Henry.",

We were there for lunch, the place was packed, and my friend and i could not hear each other to have a conversation in a booth.  It looked like a False ceiling over the bar area... maybe extend that out into the dining area?  I don't know how to mitigate the noise level, but I won't be back unless I'm dining alone since you can't have a conversation anyway!  Otherwise, the place is great... they do have tables outside, but since it was 110 degrees outside, sitting outside is not an option for a few months!",

I ordered the prime rib sandwich. It was low on meat, high on onions and if it were sold at Arbys for 4$ I still wouldnt order it. This however was 18$ with some pretty good coleslaw.

The atmosphere is casual and not too loud great date spot. We ordered the half bird and pizza. Both came out great and tasted delicious. I was bummed about paying a extra dollar for sauce but we got the lemon garlic and the pineapple teriyaki and I would get both of them again in a heartbeat. We ordered the BBQ chicken pizza and it was fantastic. Cant wait to go back and try a different pizza. All and all bang for your buck I would highly recommend it.",

The food was incredible   We were there as they opened and within an hour the place was packed. This didn't interfere with the service either. I highly recommend this place.  A bonus , it was my birthday and was treated to an incredible dessert as well.  I will return again and for sure will ask to sit in Arinn's section. Thank you for a great experience.",

After inquiring about the correct sauce, and the appetizer, it finally arrived but no real apology, no visit from the manager.

I had a garden chopped salad...indistinguishable from their other salads. The portion was small and the added chicken was meager and some of it inedible: $15.00 and no bread.  compare that to what you get at Wildflower for $5.00 less with a bigger portion and quality bread.  With a glass of passable wine (not that generous) my bill was $25.00 leaving me hungry and disappointed.  As other's have pointed out it's expensive for what you get. Poor value for money spent. Pretty place though.",

To my curiosity I thought this place must be that great!  Second visit was during the weekday/noonish. We ordered the Cesar salad and BBQ chicken pizza. The salad was ok, not the best I have had. The pizza was over powered by the sauce. You couldn't taste the chicken.  My Third and last visit I figured I would give them another chance. Since this is an upcoming restaurant and by now they should have all their kinks fixed. I made reservations for a Friday night for 3 people. We arrive 15 mins before our reserved time. We were told to wait for an open table (I could spot 4 empty table) but I waited. This restaurant was not design for customers to wait for an open table. You lean again a wall, as you watch others enjoy their meal and hope one gets up and leaves so you can be seated next. 20 mins pass our reserve time and we finally get seated. We ordered wings, the taste was over powered by a sweetness and sauce. We ordered 2 pizzas, they were meh.  I give this place a 3 stars because they cook from scratch.",

    "text": "The first thing you'll notice about this latest Fox Restaurant Concept facility is how LOUD it is inside.  Like a lot of other Fox RC locations there is no attempt to cushion the ambient noise with any type of acoustical device.  With an open wood ceiling, bare floors, and minimal cushions on the wicker chairs all you can hear is the background din, which quickly becomes uncomfortable.   I would imagine employees who spend a good deal of time here will need a good audiologist in just a few years.  I thought Zinburger in Gilbert and Olive and Ivy in Scottsdale were loud but this place takes first place.  The schtick here is pizza and roasted chicken, an unusual combination, for sure.  My wife had the aviator pizza and I had the 1/2 chicken.  She thought the pizza was OK, but nothing special.  The crust was soft and sloppy, so its not a New York-style pizza where you can pick up a firm-crusted slice, fold it in half length-wise and eat it.  You'll have to eat it Trump-style, with a knife and fork!  My bird was just OK, too.  Again, nothing special.  For $17 you get a breast, wing, leg, and thigh.  For $5 I can get a similar tasting whole ready-to-eat chicken at the grocery store and be just as satisfied.  I could not get excited about this bird.  If you are going to base half your restaurant on roasted chicken, and get nearly $6 a pound for it to boot, it should be memorable.  It was not.  It tasted just like chicken.  The decor is nothing special, providing little in the way of ambience. There is no warm, cozy feeling, at all.  In fact, it replicates the coldness of Zinburger with the high tops and tables and hostess station.  I understand repeating this design model is probably cost effective, but for nearly $50 for lunch this place is no more or less pleasant than a Denny's.  Service was good; our server was certainly attentive and friendly.",

Got here and had a wait, understandably so, when we were seated there were 5 of us, we were brought water, and I had asked for a Diet Coke and one of my girls a Dr Pepper. That took 15 minutes, ok well we were still looking over the very odd menu... our server started out very high energy but used the phrase, fur sure fur sure, about 10 times per visit. Lol finally he gets our food order in 45 minutes later, and mind you we are a larger table and by now people are leaving, but he's babysitting a two top which is great, but we had been out of drinks for 20 minutes and our food still hadn't come. Some other really nice server ended up refilling our drinks and dropping off our food. Now it's been an hour. Food not so good. I ordered a Brussels sprout pizza and it was like the rejected lettuce pieces that you throw away before you cook them, and everyone else's food wasn't that great, let's just say we had leftovers for days but didn't even bother getting to go boxes. Our waiter checked on us never, but the gentleman who dropped off our food did. We are really big into tipping and the tab was quiet hefty so had the server been more attentive, and checked on our food and kept our waters at least filled up he would have had a great night with us! My husband tipped minimum 20% and gave the waiter who actually helped us a cash tip as well! We appreciate good service wherever we go and the service and food was no good for us here. It's so close to our house too! So 2.5 hours and some pizzas later we hit a fro yo place that was open still! Lol",

We ordered a beer, margarita, Stromboli and we both ordered a half rotisserie chicken. The bill came up to $85 with tip. Our meal was good, but we will be revisiting other restaurants before this one for sure. First of all, we thought the service was spot on and the staff was very attentive. We decided not to try the pizza because we already have some favorite pizza spots in the area. Our Stromboli was good, but it was missing something. We requested marinara sauce on the side and we were thankful we did. I personally think it needs thin slice of meat like salami to give it more flavor. We got a little adventurous with the side of 5 sauces for the rotisserie chicken. Our favorite was the jerk sauce and the buffalo sauce. Our least favorite was the jalapeno pesto.  The chicken was good, but I didn't think it was anything spectacular. Overall, I'd rather go back to Sam Fox's other restaurant, The Henry.",

The atmosphere in Doughbird is electric! The lighting is nice - too many restaurants are too dark. The space is big and open and I found myself just looking around to take it all in. The staff were all very friendly but not fake. They had old school etch-a-sketches for the kids and they loved them! I'm not even sure if my kids had ever played with one or not. The chicken I got was delicious! You can order different sauces to dip it in and I got three different ones and they were all amazing! The kids got pizzas and enjoyed those. We got deserts and those were just average. If you are really craving desert it should hit the spot, but if you can do without, save your pennies on those.

Restaurant is beautiful both architecturally and decoratively-sort of a more formal Flower Child. Hostess was friendly and our party of 4 were seated promptly at our reservation time.  Our server was full of personality and knew the menu up and down and made several suggestions on how to sample the fare. We ordered 2 pizzas-a pepperoni and sausage and a wild mushroom, and a whole bird with a side of mac & cheese. The pizza was quite good-at first, excellent crust, but then the salt overload hit. I understand the saltiness of the pepperoni & sausage but the mushroom pizza after several bites was too much. On to the rotisserie chicken-$24 with one side-it was just, fine. I wasn't blown away, it wasn't the best I've had, just okay. For $24 keep the cheese-less, tasteless mac and cheese and give me a crave worthy rotisserie chicken!  We ordered all three desserts-The Elvis-peanut butter, banana, chocolate pudding in a jar, it was okay, the warm butterscotch cake, absolutely delicious and the peach tart, also an incredible winner.  Return visit? Probably not. Nothing offended or overly impressed me, but for the prices, I was hoping for much more.",

We had the shishito peppers with the umami sauce which paired very well, those peppers were charred to perfection. We ended up trying half the chicken and next time we will get the whole because it's full of so much flavor. We asked our server how it's made and they brine it and use a dry rub to make it and the chickens are free rage so it's not a huge bird like everyone's use to. They let you choice a side and we went for the califlower mash and it was good, the texture threw me off since it's nothing like mashed potatoes. Last we got something completely different and out of our comfort zone. A pizza which had Brussel sprouts, sweet potato, bacon, smoked mozzarella, and pistachios. It was surprisingly tasty, all the toppings blended well and we can't wait to go by and try the rest of their items!",

I've enjoyed the pizza, salads, sandwiches, sides and desserts. The Staff are friendly. The parking is glitchy/limited, so be prepared to take advantage of the complimentary valet. Also, Open Table or other resrvations are a must. Fox Concept Restaurants got it just right with this one. However, it's a little loud. The patios are fab when the weather cools off, but too warm in \"summer\".  Check out the menu and I am sure you'll find something you like!! I think even the pickiest eaters will like this menu!!",

    "text": "Within this review, i'll try my best to summarize the good & bad in relation to my 3-out-of-5 star rating... I'll just cut to the chase & say that I finally tried this place after much anticipation (I live in the area)...   FOOD:  Chicken can be hit-miss depending on how fresh it is/etc, & I guess we came at a good time because the chicken was very moist & flavorful. The Apple & Goat Cheese Salad was AMAZING (as was the mac n cheese & the \"Elvis\" parfait I had for dessert), & although the pizza is different it is tasty. I got the gluten-free crust which did remind me of cardboard, but standard crust tends to leave me bloated these days, so in my case it was a tradeoff. Opinions on the pizza will vary, so i'll say this: Think of the pizza at Doughbird as an option for you to get pizza & chicken at the same spot.. Don't think of it as pizza you'd get at a dedicated \"pizza joint\" because there indeed are FAR better options in the nearby area/abroad & you will likely be disappointed if you come into Doughbird with that mindset/expectation. I wasn't too worried because on my current diet I really can't eat alot of pizza to begin with, so I knew that if I didn't like the pizza i'd still have the chicken at my disposal.   SERVICE:  While there are DEFINITELY some winners working here (even up near the front), it seems like there is some disorganization amongst some (if not all) of the waiters/waitresses. In addition, some of the waitresses (one of which i'm praying I never have to be served by) are somewhat rude/snobby... Had to wait up front for somewhere close to 30 minutes for a booth, followed by a pretty long wait for our food & it wasn't THAT busy when we arrived... Hopefully all of this will be ironed out in time. Nonetheless, in my eyes, your waiter/waitress is the face of the restaurant, so when they're rude/snobby it can create an absolutely terrible first-impression & possibly cause first-time customers not to return for a second visit.   PRICING:  I won't recite all of the pricing, but I can say that the salad was $10 & to add some chicken to the salad was an additional $4... What kinda irritated me was the fact that the amount of chicken added was probably less than an ounce... So you're paying $4 to add less than an ounce of chicken meat to your salad... With that being said, i'm definitely not a fan of the portion size of chicken with relation to how much you're paying just to add chicken to your salad. It should AT LEAST be a good 2 ounces of chicken at that price, but $4 is a bit obnoxious for what you're getting & i'm not quite sure who came up with that type of pricing. Across the board the place definitely isn't the cheapest, but when the food quality/portion size is adequate I think most of us are willing to splurge every now & then. The \"powers that be\" at Doughbird should take note of this & adjust accordingly. When people feel like you're quietly overcharging them for certain items, it becomes a turnoff & can slowly drive them away from your restaurant.  THE VERDICT:  Will I be back? Very good chance that I will... But i'll be back expecting a long wait, overcharging for certain menu items/add-ons & a couple rude waitresses. If none of the above improves, I may eventually write the place off completely. But for now, we'll see how the next visit goes.",

    "text": "Okay, so by now you may have heard this place is about chicken and pizza. That's correct, but it's more than just chicken and pizza. It's tender, fall apart in your mouth perfectly seasoned chicken, with beautifully crafted pizzas that are pretty phenomenal. But not only that, the prime rib. Oooohhhh the prime rib . Ridiculous. Although this place is a bit pricey, it's quite the experience and definitely worth it.   Here's what we tried.  1) the whole chicken - with jalapeno pesto  Solid choice.   2) the 14oz prime rib - with horseradish creme fraiche  Beautiful. The bite with the salt peppery crust and a chunk of the fat with the tender meat...  tears in my eyes. OH and the potato puree. Oh man. Delish.   3) the black truffle pizza ? I think that's what it's called. This one was pretty interesting... when it comes the first thing that hits you is the smell. Like BAM. Truffle in face. If that's your thing, it's solid. If not, look somewhere else.   4) the aviator - a very solid meat pizza  very delicious. It was the first thing to go on our table.   5) a \"stubborn\" root beer - it's like regular root beer except it's made with cane sugar, a little flatter, and leans a bit towards cream soda. Interesting.   Service was very friendly :) and the place is hip and beautiful. Come and try it for yourself!",

I've been ALL over the Middle East and I'm picky as hell about hummus. And yes, there is a difference between Lebanese and israeli hummus (and they both will say theirs is the best).  ;)     Their hummus is the sh*%.   Creamy, fresh and CLEARLY made with fresh garbonzo beans rather than canned.  I noted the sumac on the bread as well. I just wish we could get more veggies to dip with, I always have to ask for more; which they accommodate.  The chicken is amazing and if you ask , they will remove from the bone.  I have loved both the mashed cauli and the brussell sprouts sides.    The chicken is fresh, tender and oh so juicy.  The truffle stromboli?  OMG  this is actually a perfect size for one person.  Think calzone with truffle cheese!!  If you're really hungry or split with someone, get the pizza. I recently had the BBQ chicken and it was amazing.  If you don't like cilantro (which I love), then you need to note that you shoujld ask for that OFF.    It's always packed so call ahead or hope for a spot at the bar. Once it cools off, the patio will offer more seating space.",

    "text": "Doughbird eponymously boasts of their pizza and chicken menu -- which falls flat. The pizza, of which I have tried both the Spiral Ham and the Aviator, were both good, but not spectacular by any stretch of the imagination. During both of my visits, my party ordered a half chicken, which is served with your choice of sauce (on the side) and a side. Both times, the chicken was cooked very well: tender, melt off the bone, and buttery; however, the meat itself was bland, bland, bland. The sauce served on the side helped little, as there was no way for the cooked meat to marinate. Overall, for a restaurant to name itself after those two dishes, I believe they should be outstanding. Certainly not \"meh.\"  The saving grace of Doughbird are the appetizers and the desserts. The hummus was delicious and their wings (actually covered in sauce) were good. And the warm butterscotch cream cake was heavenly. Definitely a fun place to grab snacks with friends, but certainly not something you HAVE to try.",

The restaurant is beautiful and spacious inside, reflecting gray and white tones, and modern decor. I was lucky enough to have a great group of friends to accompany me in the experience.   To start we ordered a couple of appetizers. I highly recommend the Lebanese hummus; its so delicious, I can't compare it to anything I've ever had before. We also had the buffalo wings and they are also a must!!! They come with a homemade herb ranch that is so tasteful, you'll want the recipe.  For entrees, we ordered various pizzas: the aviator, the margherita, and the pepperoni/burrata. The pizzas surpassed beyond my expectations. No one complained about any of them. We also ordered the prime rib, which melted in your mouth, and it's nicely paired with great sauces. We sadly didn't order any chicken, but I'm definitely coming back.  Honestly the best part was the service!! My server (whose name I can't remember) was so attentive and kind. He definitely made my experience memorable. Everyone at my party could not stop raving on how great he was. You definitely don't get service like that anywhere. (He was the one with the gold glasses.. super laid back guy.)

The restaurant had a cute chic bakery feel with amazing tiled floors, the floors are my favorite.   The staff is so friendly and very helpful. The host greets you with a smile and my waitress was the sweetest ever.   On to the food.... We ordered the simple Cesar salad with the rotisserie chicken. For a simple salad it was very tasty with just the right amount of Cesar dressing. If you love brussel sprouts you have to try them here! The brussel sprouts are mixed in with a maple syrup. Not too sweet. The best I've ever had! The pizza here is mind blowing! We ordered the Barbeque Chicken pizza. This pizza has a lot going on but all the ingredients ness well. This pizza is a wood fire thin pizza with bbq sauce, rotisserie chicken, corn, cilantro, cheese, and a jalapeno pesto sauce. The jalapeno pesto does give it a spicy kick. So if you don't enjoy pizza this isn't for you.   The dessert wasn't anything too special.  Over all the experience was great! The prices are too bad if you're sharing. I'll be back for sure!",

I didn't know it was a Fox Concepts but it all makes sense once I heard that. Open kitchen, specialty cocktails and simplistic get great food and overall great time.   Ordered the Aviator and the Half Bird. Both fantastic choices to get and try for the first time. The aviator was full of meat and tasty. I would order it again for sure. Make sure if you want ranch, ask because they have it and it's homemade like the rest of their sauces. The half bird was full of flavor cooked perfect and was another great choice.   Definitely left full. Check my pictures for the drinks we ordered and the bourbon and bell was the best out of the 4 we had.   Amy was really good. She was personal, related to us and just had fun serving us. She was also in a great mood which helps.   The manager even came by to say hi and check in with us to make sure we had a good experience. We actually had two sauces that maybe with the dishes we got didn't excite us. The umami and pineapple teriyaki sauces were ok. Again this is probably the dishes we had but the ranch topped it all off. We even said it wasn't the great and although it is a $1 a piece they took it off the bill which we didn't ask for. So our experience was to the nines with picking up cues that we didn't demand.   My only thing that doesn't deserve any negativity for stars is there is no happy hour. Having one would entice me to come more too. Just a thought.   I will definitely be back and order something new. This place is awesome and so was Amy.",

Our family of four ordered 2 pizzas, rotisserie prime rib and the rotisserie \"fish\" which was a river trout from Sweden that looked like Salmon for $27 including a side.   The cocktail menu was pretty good at $10 each, but the wine list was not great. I started with a Sauvignon Blanc, which was not great. I switched to a red blend for my second glass, but it was not great at $15/glass.   I'd say this is weak. The restaurant was crowed at 5:30, but I would not waste time or money here again.",

In addition to the brussels, this pizza also comes with sweet potatoes and bacon on it.  We asked for the bacon on the side since I don't eat meat and this was easily accommodated.  I thought the crust had a nice flavor and was soft without being too \"doughy.\"  Very delicious.  I'm not a fan of the Fox restaurants in general, but they did seem to get it right with this place.  Even their website is normal and not the usual over-the-top and trying way too hard marketing nonsense.  If you are looking for a good pizza, that has some unique topping choices/combinations, try this place out.",

Albeit I have yet to try their rotisserie prime rib, I can be sure it's spectacular if it amounts to the pizza or chicken. Whether you have a heavy appetite or light, this is the place for you. They incorporate your standard personal pizza at a restaurant as niche as this, but also more unconventional. I had an exceptional pastrami mustard seed pizza that I still can't get off my mind. The waiter recommended their horse radish dipping sauce which was perfect. One of my favorite things about this is with a group of people, everyone can get something completely different. The rotisserie has a slew of dipping sauce options, as well as great sides, and they carry a lot of local beer and cocktails. My wife and I love this place and I recommend it to anyone.",

Is this place run by a cult and brainwashing's on the menu?  I visited Doughbird with a party of 4 and we ordered almost everything on the menu and we literally were in shock that anyone would return here after their first experience. First we ordered the $25.00 whole chicken and we all agreed it was not any better then Boston Market for a quarter of the cost. The chicken came with one side which we choose Mac and Cheese (very dry and tasteless) we ordered additional sides as well. The beans were very good and the potatoes were average but enjoyable.  Second we ordered the BBQ sandwich. Once again, I describe this as mediocre at best. Certainly nothing to go back for. The side accompanying the sandwich was coleslaw. The coleslaw was fabulous.  Finally we ordered 2 pizzas. Bacon and truffled egg & BBQ Chicken. They were good but nothing to get excited about. Certainly not something you would have to go to Doughbird to get. Unique gourmet pizza joints are popping up on every corner. Even though we were full we still were trying to understand why this place was getting the raves it was so we thought maybe the desserts are the star. So we ordered the warm butterscotch cream cake. And once again we all fell down from the high pedestal of expectations to the boring low spot of nothing special. The dessert was dry and completely unexciting. We truly sat there looking at our hefty bill in confused astonishment.  In conclusion, most of the time, the reviews on yelp can guide you to some amazing culinary experiences but in regards to the Doughbird, DON'T believe it. SKIP IT!!! You'll be glad you did.",

I have been to this restaurant several times, thought it would be great to take my parents out to for Fathers Day, since they have never been.  Unfortunately, we had a waitress that you could tell didn't want to be at work.  Her attitude was horrible and she was very snippy and didn't talk when she should have.  ex. food was brought out by other servers she came by the table and just glared at us and kept on walking, didn't check to see if we needed anything, didn't see if we got everything just kept it moving.  Also when I asked for a straw for my kids because they ordered hot tea she challenged me by saying it will melt the straw and didn't think I needed one. Yes, ma'am u are right if my children drank piping hot tea it sure would, but they pretty much order the tea and wait for it to get to room temp hence they wanted straws, hence why I asked for them.  For a fathers day lunch and me telling him what a great place it was I felt bad we had such a rude waitress, bad first impression for them.  We both tipped 15% & I left a note that said \"have a blessed day\" because maybe she wasn't having a good one.  But remember to smile and be kind it will get you much further in life.",

The only negative is I wish the skin was crispy on the chicken and at first I thought the price on the chicken was a little high but I still thought it was worth it.  Service was great!",

    "text": "Ok so I didn't know what to expect based on the last couple reviews but I am an equal opportunity eater and don't really care if its a chain or who owns the joint, but how the food tastes and if the service is good.  If those two things are excellent, price isn't really a concern, as I don't mind paying for a good experience.  A couple of friends and I ate here last night and the food was excellent, the service was fast and prompt and they even gave my pup a bowl of water.    The chicken was tender, well seasoned, and the portion was big for the price in my opinion.  You can either get a half chicken or a whole chicken and the half was more than I could finish. I got the Jalapeno Pesto for the sauce and it was really good and had just the right amount of kick.  The side was mashed cauliflower, this is something that is not always done right, but it was done right here, I really enjoyed it and the sauce and side complimented the chicken well.     We also got a pizza and it was excellent.  The place was packed the entire time we were there, and still had a small wait when we left around 8:30.   They have valet which is a good thing because otherwise the parking is non-existent.  There is not enough parking at this complex period, I am not sure how the other businesses deal with it.    Great service, great food, gave me a drink to go, DOG FRIENDLY patio.  5 stars... We will be back for sure.",

My husband and I shared the BBQ chicken pizza, green chili chicken soup (that bomb in house chicken again), and the side of broccolini. The pizza blew us away, dough was so flavorful and salty. The soup was good and had blasts of different spices. The side of broccolini was eh not the best, lacked a little ummmf. We will be back and we might even go right now!

I let the waitress know that I didn't want cheese on the salad, and she was really great about making sure that there wasn't cheese/dairy on any of my food due to an allergy. My husband got a pastrami sandwich and potato wedges as well. Our friends, got another salad and a pizza. Everything we ordered came out perfectly. I love the freshness of the rotisserie chicken on my salad! The potato wedges were everything! Crispy and soft in the middle. I loved them! My husband really like to sandwich, especially the bread which I'm assuming was their homemade dough. Service was excellent! I just wish this place was closer to home!

Everything was really good. The chicken in particular had a very good flavor and I would go back for that alone. Also tried a couple of their desserts and they were also definitely worth checking out. Very nice place and I can't wait to go back.",

If they can get the basics right, they'll be ok.  We very much enjoyed the vast beer and wine selection. My better half had a half chicken with the lemon garlic sauce and I enjoyed a whole bird with the horseradish creme fraishe and OHMYGOD that sauce was outstanding. I think we'll have to come back and try out the prime rib.   The desert was delightful and not too sweet, it was a sort of buttered rum cake with a scoop of vanilla gelato, whats not to like.

I ordered the \"Asian Chicken\" pizza hoping to try something different that i couldn't find at one the 20 other pizza places in town. When it came i was extremely disappointed! Tastes like someone went across the street to Pei Wei and dumped their food onto a pizza before baking it. None of the flavors worked well together. Total mess!! Tasted like something you come up with after doing LSD.   I only ate 2 slices, mostly because I was starving. Tried taking it home because i felt extremely guilty wasting food when other people in the world go hungry. but i ended up tossing it out because it was just so unappetizing I couldn't eat another slice.   The crust however was decent so maybe one of their more boring/traditional pizzas might actually be okay.   My friend got the chicken and he seemed to like it. So maybe try that.   Just please skip the pizza i ordered. It made me question if anyone actually tasted the dishes before putting them on the menu? Or Maybe the Fox group was just in a rush to put out another \"restaurant\" ASAP and could care less about the food.",

    "text": "After learning that one of our other favorite spots in Arcadia totally switched up their restaurant style [talkin' about you, LGO], we had to search for a nearby place for a late lunch, then we remembered driving past Dough Bird and we figured we stop by, I am so glad we did!  When the weather is more enjoyable, they have a cute & cozy patio with misters, looking forward to going back in the fall when it's not melting hot outside!   The service was really good, or waiter was really nice, asked if it was our first time and so he took the time to walk us through the menu and point out some of his recommendations.   We ordered the Aviator, Half Bird with Mac and Cheese and Lemon Garlic sauce. I ordered the Afternoon Tea cocktail - very refreshing! Almost dangerously refreshing!  Our drinks came out really quick. But the food took a lot longer. It was almost to the point when I was going to say something because our waiter hadn't been back to check on us and we didn't order any apps so it was starting to linger too long. But just then a manager stopped by to let us know that they accidentally burnt the pizza, she said that they didn't want serve us an overcooked pizza and asked if we'd be okay with waiting another 5 mins and they'll bring it all out at once. We were fine with that and appreciated that they stopped by, only wish they had stopped by a little sooner, our tummies were growling.   When the food arrived, it smelled and looked great! The mac and cheese is as classic as it can get, which is great! The chicken was juicy and tender, the lemon & garlic sauce was very zesty, but I really enjoyed it. But I will say the pizza was wanting. It had a bit of a soggy bottom. I think they over-compensated for the burnt pizza and this one came out a bit undercooked. But we were hungry so we enjoyed it.   I'll def be back and bring some more friends. Overall it was a really good experience!",

So SO So good I want about twenty portions of it. Then we had the asian chicken pizza and it was amazing.

I recommend making a reservation, they do have open seating at the bar which we were lucky enough to snag two seats as soon as we arrived.   I did some research before to see what others have tried, so we decided to go with the hummus as an appetizer and it was delicious! The pita it comes with was cooked perfectly and the hummus has great flavor, was fresh and extra creamy. For our main dish we split the Margherita pizza...amazing! The crust is thin, but not super crunchy and their sauce has a little bit of sweetness to it.  The service was a little slow, it took a few minutes for someone to come say hello and get our drink order. If you sit at the bar you get to watch the magic happen (the making of pizza). Overall, the atmosphere and food were great. We can't wait to go back and try out other items on the menu!",

And this bird you'll split and roast, And this bird you'll split and roast,  Yelp knows, I can sing Yelp, help me, I can sing...... Yelp, I can sing Won't you review, Doughbird, yeah!?  Mr. Fox has done it again with Doughbird; a pizza and rotisserie chicken restaurant.  The restaurant itself is as always beautiful like most Fox restaurants.  It has a open and farm to table look with a brunch-like atmosphere.  I came with a friend and sat at the bar and started with some cocktails.  For our appetizers we ordered the Lebanese Hummus, Heirloom Tomatoes, and Heath Bread.  The bread was warm to the bite almost like it was freshly baked; while the hummus was smooth and creamy!  The tomatoes provided a sweet texture; I went two rounds of the bread!  For our entrees with share the Rocky Free Range Chicken, but only half of it.  For our sides we chose the Cauliflower Mash along with the Horseradish Creme Fraiche and Jamaican Jerk Marmalade sauce for our chicken.  We also ordered the Bacon and Truffle Egg pizza, yeah I know what you're thinking; that's a lot of food!?  Yes, indeed it was!    The chicken was done to perfection; crispy skin and warm soft chewy meat within.  The horseradish stung my sinus, but was subtle enough to ease onto my palates.  The marmalade with sweet and spicy which I like with my chicken.  The cauliflower mashed was one of my favorite bites of the night with chunks of cauliflower still available giving it a texture along with the creaminess.  Our pizza I thought was okay since it was more of a breakfast pizza because of the chunks of eggs and bacon.  I didn't really get a taste of the truffles, but definitely needed some more truffle oil.    In the end, Doughbird is a spot worth trying.  The food here is pretty solid and you can't beat a Fox Restaurant atmosphere! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "I have been to Dough Bird several times and it's always been great and I do enjoy the food. Normally the only questionable thing is how little sauce they give you when you purchase a whole chicken. When I went last week they where not very busy but my food took 40 minutes to come which I can deal with but my food came out almost warm and only came out when I asked the server if they forgot to put out order in. After receiving the food my best guess is that they just forgot to give it to us. The server never admitted this but instead through the kitchen under the bus. Manager came and said it was only 20 minutes not 40 minutes which was not True and then offered to bring my food out scolding hot in her words which came across very sarcastic and I just want my food at normal temperature. Not barley warm or scolding hot. I was shocked at how unprofessional the manger was and I wonder if it was a server saying she was a manager because hard to believe a manager would be that rude. They offered to pay to my food but I refused because I felt uncomfortable with how I was treated and I just walked out. Too bad I live next to this place and did have good experiences before this horrible experience last week!",

    "text": "We're just in Arizona for the holiday weekend, and Doughbird was on our list! Here's how our lunch broke down down:  Parking & misc. -- the restaurant is located in a little shopping center, so there's plenty of parking.    Ambiance -- the restaurant is beautifully decorated (as most Fox restaurants are) and looks great.    Food -- the food is incredible. We ended up going with the classic, a pizza and half a chicken. The pizza was flavorful, fresh, full of fantastic ingredients -- it had just come out of the oven! Our chicken was the best thing we'd eaten, ever. I mean chicken is usually fine, but it's never mind blowing. This chicken, however, was. Something to do with the rotisserie of it?   Highly recommend this place, and if you do go, sit in Clifford's section. Clifford was the nicest server we've had in a long time, he was extremely courteous, friendly, spoke very well of the company (his employer) and even gave us fun tips for where to visit during our stay. We'll be back (next time we're in town)!",

Crust was crispy and then soft as you bite in. The pepperoni was perfect! Had a spicy note at the end. Mozzarella cheese was stringy and delicious. Also had the rotisserie chicken with lemon garlic sauce and glazed Brussels sprouts. It was phenomenal!",

Lots of great options and everything was filled with delicious flavors.  However I was a bit disappointed with the service that we received.  I made a reservation and when we arrived, we were seated outside.  We were not asked if that was OK, we were just seated there.  It was a bit cold so we asked if they would turn on one of the heaters.  After asking several times, twenty minutes after we were seated, they were finally able to get a heater tuned on for our table.",

    "text": "My girlfriend and I have been planning to try Doughbird since they first opened in late-March of 2017. However, due to the far-out location and consistently average reviews I've given most Fox Concepts, we kept putting it off, before finally deciding to bite the bullet on a Thursday night.  Going in and taking one look around, the restaurant looks and feels pretty much like I expected. I'd describe it as sort of a modern-take on a southern-inspired dining area. It's clean, it's sleek, it's lively, and it reeks of that \"hip-corporate\" vibe that urban crowds seem to be an absolute sucker for. Personally, I find it almost too meticulously perfect, to the point where it feels sterile and somewhat fake - but it seems to work for them, so who am I say otherwise? The place was pretty packed on a Thursday evening, requiring a 15-20-minute wait time. Clearly, they're doing something right.  Initially, we started with their truffle cheese stromboli, which is self-explanatory. Even though I have major issues with using fake truffle oil over legitimate truffle shavings, this was actually a respectable starter - as none of the other options looked too appetizing, in my opinion.  We decided to order one pizza and a half-bird of rotisserie \"free range\" chicken (gotta be sure we get those buzz words in for those millennials, right?). The chicken comes with one-side and one sauce, so we opted for some mac and cheese, along with lemon and roasted garlic sauce, in addition to pineapple teriyaki. For pizza, we chose the pepperoni and burrata, which is your standard pepperoni pizza with a bit of burrata spread throughout.   The pizza, which I usually judge very harshly, was just okay. Topping quality was fine. The burrata was better than a lot of places we've sampled, but nowhere in the league of some of our more exclusive favorites. Crust was pretty basic, offering a bit of flavor (but not much) and a spongy texture. It's not the charred wood-fired style, but traditionally baked pizza (at least that's what it seems like). I've never considered the pizzas at Fox-owned North Italia to be all that great, so my lack of enthusiasm was to be fully expected.   Now, the chicken. This is something that they definitely do well. Although rotisserie will never be my preferred way to eat the bird, the meat quality was juicy and full of flavor. Sauce flavors were a bit subjective, so you might have to experiment, but the meat itself was lovely and moist. The best we've had? Not by a long shot, but still done quite well!  The mac and cheese, which uses shells similar to the boxed Velveeta my Mom would make, was kind of lame. It was very dry and rubbery, which I imagine was the result of the mac just sitting around in a pot for far too long. Flavor was okay, but it is probably not something I'd order again.  For dessert, we opted for \"The Elvis.\" These days, pretty much anything that incorporates peanut butter and bananas is named after The King. You're getting a peanut butter and chocolate parfait, with bananas, whipped cream, and bacon sandies. My girlfriend points out that Fox absolutely loves selling deserts that they can pack into a jar and this is no different. She liked it a bit more than I did, just simply because pudding-based desserts have never really been my thing. Nevertheless, quality was fine and it's probably something that a lot of people would enjoy.  Like all Fox restaurants, servers were very friendly and prices were reasonable for the amount of food that you receive.  So, the question is: Would we go back? Possibly one day. While their pizza isn't anything to shout praises about, they do offer very decent quality pollo. So I guess when us \"fried folk\" are in the mood to eat something a bit less heavy, Doughbird is a respectable option.  Recommended to try out.",

Had the Margherita Pizza, Pastrami Pizza, Prime Rib Dip Sandwich and the Peach Streusel Pie.  The Margherita Pizza was very good according to my daughter and she loved the fresh mozzerella and she is pretty particular about pizza. I ordered the Pastrami Pizza with roasted Kale, it does taste alot better than it sounds. This combination was pretty good and enjoyed each slice. We shared the Prime Rib Dip Sandwich and forgot to tell them to place the horse radish on the side, it was too overwhelming for her, but not bad for me. The meat was plentiful and the au jus was a good temperature.  It was my birthday and I have been wanting to try the restaurant, so when our waiter Hunter found out it was my birthday, he told me to pick a dessert on the house, we chose the Peach STruesel Pie with Ice Cream and I must say you can't go wrong with that choice.  We will definitely be back to try the Prime Rib and Rotisserie. Our server Hunter definitely made this visit attain the 5 stars",

The food was great, the service was spot on, and the atmosphere is warm and inviting.    For food, we decided to go with the rotisserie plate instead of the pizza, and I am so glad we did!  The skin on the bird was crispy and the meat was juicy, but the star was 100% the side sauce.  We ordered the jalapeno pesto, and oh my lord.....I would bathe in that stuff if it wasn't frowned upon.  The jalapeno pesto was fresh, bright and had just the right amount of spice to it.  We asked out waitress if they would sell us a jar of it, and unfortunately she couldn't, but if they ever start bottling that stuff I'm picking up a few and putting it on everything.  Seriously, get that sauce...it's amazing!  And the atmosphere is what you've come to love about Fox restaurants.  It's comfortable yet hip, and not stuffy in the least so everyone can feel comfortable to come dine here. Definitely a great place for a dinner out with friends, or a casual date night.  All in all I am psyched to have Doughbird to add to my restaurant rotation, and cannot wait to go back and dine again!",

    "text": "Whenever I have a friend come to town and want to try some local cuisine, I immediately think of the Fox Restaurant Concepts.  So many creative concepts, and Doughbird is one of the latest.  Ironically, my two favorite cuisines are pizza and chicken.  What do you get when you combine the two?  Doughbird, of course!!  I just went last night to Doughbird for my second time since it had opened, and to be honest, I'm not sure why I don't go on a regular basis.  Great concept, easy parking, short waits, good service, and delicious food!    During my first visit, my guest and I both shared a truffle cheese stromboli appetizer, I ordered the free range chicken (half) and she ordered carmelized cauliflower.  My chicken came with macaroni and cheese as a side dish.  We then ordered pie for dessert.  Last night, we shared a pizza and a caesar salad.  Note that you can have a pizza personalized as you wish.  You do not have to stick with the options given on the menu (though they do sound pretty good).  All the food tasted delicious!    My only thoughts were that the prices are a bit high for pizza or chicken, and again, as a fan of both foods, it would be amazing to have a combination of pizza and chicken in one dish.  Perhaps a slice of pizza and some chicken?  I'm sure the restaurant can think up something more creative than that.  Also, the menu should mention that pizzas can be personalized.  Those were just a few of my thoughts.    The restaurant is one of many that can be found on the corner of 44th Street and Indian School Road (southwest corner).  Both times, I found myself with many options for parking and only a short wait upon arrival.  Waiting for food took a little while during my first visit but was pretty quick during yesterday's visit.   I did learn after the fact that you can make a reservation on their website or on OpenTable.  When you sign up for their e-mail list, you can get $10 off a $20 purchase during your next visit.",

The chicken is moist and tender, I love the variety of sides (fave is mashed cauliflower), and sauces (although none of the ones I've tried have been that great, I just love dipping sauces). Just went back today for the second time and my husband ordered a pizza. The pizza was yummy! I asked him how he liked it and he said, \"It's good, kind of like Blaze Pizza.\" Which made me realize... why didn't we just go to Blaze and spend half the money? And why didn't we just buy a $5 Costco rotisserie chicken?  The reason I can't love this place is that it's the most basic American cuisine items of pizza and chicken except at fancy restaurant prices. Half a chicken and side is $17. Yeah it's good chicken but have you tried Costco's chicken?",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I ordered the Bacon & Truffled egg and the Barbecue Beef. Eggs on a pizza?! Sounds weird right? Surprisingly, it was really good. I actually liked it better than the barbecue beef.   The Bacon & Truffled Egg pizza is more of a breakfast pizza, but I'm the type of person to eat breakfast for breakfast, lunch, and dinner. So if you don't have any issues with that, then this is for you. The crust is really cripsy and warm and the arugula complemented the pizza well.  The sauce was really good on the barbecue chicken pizza and the pesto sauce on it complemented the beef very well. The corn, red onions, and goat cheese was a great addition to the pizza.   Overall, the pizza is very flavorful, but it is not my favorite type crust.   The drinks are okay. I got the local and it tasted like watered down vodka. My boyfriend got the raven & Geary margarita. It was strong and delicious. You could taste the three tequilas that were infused.  Note: They also have a great rewards system for birthdays or if you sign up with your emails for specials.",

Our server was fantastic, one of the best I've had in a very long time!  He was very knowledgeable of the menu and frequently offered to match cocktail/drink pairings w the food we ordered.  It worked; we also tried a beer (grapefruit lager, I believe) and it was good too!  For dinner we each had the prime rib dip (the menu looked so good but I had been dreaming about this prime rib dip all day).  Had it w fries, thought it was all great.  Loved the au jus, though my friend was disappointed to hear that enough to take home w her leftovers would cost another dollar  I ordered a pizza to take home and opted for the Brussels sprout pizza.  I snuck a piece and it was sooooo good!!!  The bacon on top was seriously some of the best I've had!!!  Check out the pic.  And we also ordered the butterscotch cake to share for dessert.  It was pretty good too, though I thought the cake a bit dry.  Butterscotch was great.    More than anything, I would return for the Excellent server!!  I was so bummed to hear tonight would be his last night.  He was attentive, knowledgeable, and really worked hard to value the product.  He even gave me a birthday candle w my cake!!   Definitely recommend a visit; parking is tough.  Left turns are a challenge w the lights.",

The restaurant itself is absolutely beautiful. It is exactly how I want my home to look like, with the natural sunlight and gorgeous furniture. Wish I could rave the same about the food.  Doughbird specializes in pizza and rotisserie chicken so I opted for the Halfbird with a side of perfect potato puree. The potato puree was delicious and creamy. I thought the chicken was dry. The flavor was good but it was underwhelming. I picked the lemon and roasted garlic sauce on the side and it was okay. My boyfriend ordered the margherita pizza which was on the happy hour menu (4$) and he thought it was undercooked. He also ordered the buffalo chicken wings which we all thought was delicious.   The drinks were great. I ordered the watermelon daiquiri from the happy hour menu ($7). The servers were attentive and efficient.",

I ordered the Raven & Geary margarita which was not horrible just not a terrific cocktail.  The appetizers that followed our drink order left a bad taste in my mouth. The $10 hummus appetizer was EXTREMELY salty and didn't meet standards compared to other major Hummus restaurants I've enjoyed. The chicken wings were crunchy and warm but it's also EXTREMELY annoying that Fox Co. restaurants nickel and dime anyway possible in adding $1 to every dipping sauce ordered.  We asked for the wings naked so we could try out the pineapple teriyaki, buffalo, BBQ and jalapeno pesto. (Womp, womp) Pizza came out incorrect which our server immediately took back the moment it hit our table but it just added an additional 5 minutes to our time, no biggie but our crust was extra crisp. (?????)  I wanted to order dessert but realized we were already close to a $70 bill! No thanks. Doughbird is overly hyped, underwhelming and 25 minutes out of our way.  Fire&Brimstone was our last 'WOW' pizza and recommend trying them out next time your in the mood for brick oven.  As for me tonight, I'm sipping ice water to cancel out my sodium toxication.",

    "text": "Okay, it is time for me to share my thoughts on my favorite, go-to place in the Phoenix/Arcadia Area. I may have a Doughbird addiction problem. I love everything about the newest Sam Fox concept: ambiance, decor, even the tile floor, FOOD, friendly service. All in Fox Restaurant fashion.    As a vegan/vegetarian, I can't comment on the \"bird\" but my husband who has tried it and everyone we've taken here says of the meat, like Olaf: \"all good things, all good things.\"   Here are my favorites here:   CAULIFLOWER STEAK! This is now an 'entree' on the menu, but it used to and can still come a la carte with a side and 1 sauce (as the rotisserie chicken does). Strict vegans, ask for your cauli steak to be cooked without butter.   Disclaimer: their sauces are EVERYTHING (for chicken and/or cauli steak!). You will need more than one. Unfortunately extra sauces are $1 each but a price I am willing to pay every time. I always have 2. My favorite ones are Jamaican Jerk, chipotle BBQ, and garlic lemon.   PIZZA: My go-to is the Brussels Sprout pizza (okay, sad day. I just looked at their menu and it is NO LONGER ON THERE!). Wild Mushroom pizza is also great because of the black truffle. I LOVE TRUFFLE and so will you after having this pizza.   Now on to SIDES. Cauliflower mash, mashed potatoes, crispy potato wedges, broccolini (which sadly they no longer have. They now only carry steamed broccoli), and sweet corn are top of my list and all you need, trust me.   DESSERT: THE ELVIS. Must try if peanut butter and banana is your thing. Warm butterscotch cream cake is SWEET but so good too. Can't go wrong.   I have had and seen many a birthday party here. Make reservations. Thank me later.",

And the link is just that this is a savory hotspot. The decor and ambience is breathtaking, like what I see in most Sam Fox restaurants. I really just wanted to sit there all day.  I usually don't like bbq pizza. Mainly because my hubby and I order it often since it's easy to get cheeseless (hubby is lactose intolerant). But the jalapeno pesto on Dough Bird's bbq pizza peaked my interest- and it was worth it. This pizza is covered in fresh herbs, spicy bbq sauce, rotisserie chicken, cheese, and roasted corn. I love the jalapeno pesto. Can I buy that and put it on everything please? I get the link between pizza and chicken now.  Only downside is I feel like this place is pretty pricey for what you get.",

    "text": "I had pretty high expectations for Doughbird being a part of the Sam Fox restaurant concepts, but I left the restaurant feeling a little disappointed. First off, the ambiance and decor is great, as are all of the Fox restaurants. In the beginning, I thought the the combination of rotisserie chicken and pizza sounded really strange but I figured that it could somehow work. We started with the Lebanese Hummus which had a lot of flavor, but the cooks must have dropped the salt shaker in this thing because that thing was way too salty. The bread they served it with was good but they literally only give you one small bread and we had 4 people at the table? A little stingy.   Now, the entrees. I ordered the half bird which was $17 dollars and I chose the crispy potato wedges and I got a side sauce of jalapeno pesto and the Jamaican jerk marmalade. While the chicken was definitely moist and delicious, the sauces were a huge let down. If you are going to charge me for sauce then it better be some damn good sauce, which it wasn't. The jalapeno pesto was just average and it lacked flavor and spice and the Jamaican jerk marmalade was way to sweet for my palate. I came with my wife and my parents and they all ordered different pizzas from the aviator to the wild mushroom to the crispy pastrami. All of them were pretty decent, just nothing really special stood out to me. I wish there were more mushrooms on the wild mushroom and their use of \"black truffle\" was basically nonexistent. The aviator with all the meats on it was good but the meats made the pizza really greasy.   Luckily, Doughbird was able to redeem themselves with the desserts. We ordered two desserts, the Peach Streusel Pie and the Butterscotch Cake. Both of these desserts were so delightful. The butterscotch cake was probably my favorite, so warm and buttery with a creamy scoop of vanilla bean ice cream to top it off. Overall, I think my expectations were just very high for this place, and it didn't really meet them which kinda let me down. I think they need to make a few changes to menu to make it seem more appealing. I won't be begging to go back anytime soon.",

The crowd was a mix of cool kids, young families, cool adult kids with their parents and couples on date night like us. The service wasn't as good as I expected which is a bummer but I understand it was close to close etc. All the workers were nice just not as attentive as we needed.  The place is nice inside -very open feeling and they have a patio with misters.  I got fairly dressed up but seen people in tshirts and jean shorts which I thought was too underdressed. I guess whatever you feel like wearing is fine.  The food was a meh for me as a vegetarian. We ordered the hummus and I got the margherita pizza as my entree. The hummus was good -nothing special in the realm of pita jungle etc and the pizza was ok again nothing special to note. I probably won't be back since the prices were a little high for the food quality I had.",

There were two gals in the kitchen area (later found out they were from corporate) were loud and one was dressed very sloppily. No tucked in shirt. Bad shoes and messy hair.  Definitely didn't look like she belonged. And if this is corporate leading by example then they need some training    The other gal had a huge pine sticking out of her jeans and not sure if her dark hair ended up in my salmon.

The service and food was really good too! Very yummy, but ugh a little on the expensive side! I will say though, I would FOR SURE come back and try some of the other things on the menu. The pizzas, salads, and other side choices all look so amazing. For my first visit, my friend and I shared a caesar salad (really really delicious), a full bird, and side of mac and cheese.

    "text": "Came here on a small celebration of moving into town from Florida. We were excited to try the place because of the reviews. There was a pretty hefty wait when we got there (45-60 minutes). We ended up snatching a quick seat outside though.   We tried some of our favorites at any restaurant and that started with the Hummus. It's pretty good but only comes with a 6\" piece of pita. If there is more than one person eating the hummus you are going to have to buy more pita bread to use the hummus.   I got the prime rib dip (Try and say that 5 times fast lol). It was pretty good, not crazy but the fries were !   The drink prices were around $6 a beer so I refrained from purchasing any. Wine was about $8 a glass. Both a little steep for the cheapest drinks.  My table mates got the pizza and they said they were delicious. Maybe I will try those out next time and maybe I'll have a higher rating to give, but for now, 3 stars is fitting.",

Everything was really good especially the side of asparagus and broccolini as well as the pineapple teriyaki sauce that I chose for the chicken. My husband and I shared our entrees and my only wish would be the pizza crust be \"crispier\".  We will definitely go back and like to try some of the other menu items.",

There is a really cool aesthetic.   The best part about this place though is the service. Typical of a Sam Fox restaurant. I never get good service anywhere, and Im not looking for something fussy. Im just looking for some friendly people who are somewhat attentive. This restaurant always has staff that have easy smiles, smart, clean cut, and good natured. Where do you find that these days?  I spoke with the manager Ruben who was super friendly and seemed really professional. I would come here just to avoid the terrible service in other restaurants, but there is so much to like at Doughbird.",

The decor looks really nice. Modern farm house look to it.   Im a big pizza fanatic so I had to try. I was wondering if it was going to be the same as North or different. North is probably my 2nd favorite pizza in the valley so i was hoping it was similar! It was actually different but still very good.   My two other guests got the chicken and said it was amazing!   Cant wait to come back!",

I had a seat at the bar and some of the female servers were gossiping about another female server and one said, \"I hope she gets a flat tire on the way home.\"  She then proceeded to complain to the male servers at the serving bar about the other girl and what to appear as the manager never stopped the gossip nor banter. After coming here for my first time, I don't recommend this place because the quality is not of high importance, but the bantering and negativity seemed to be the highlight of the night. Sad to say I had to see the employees conduct in this manner in front of customers with no regard.",

Pastrami & Gruyere on What?  what IS that awesomeness?  It like a cross between naan and pizza crust and it held up to the moisture from meat/cheese/sauce!  Fabulous!

Let me tell you, I love wings and you can't get gluten free wings everywhere. The fact that you can here is one thing, but the fact that they are sooooo delicious and flavorful takes it to a whole other level. I also love the GF pizza crust, one of my favorites. The last time we went, however, we were a bit bummed to find that they recently made the brussel sprout pizza seasonal... a bit of a bummer as that was our go to pizza :/ I will still go here solely for the wings though.",

Clifford was our waiter and he was the best, it was nice to have someone to chat with because my dining companions were giving me the silent treatment over being forced to try on pants.  I asked Clifford what he liked the best and ordered based on his suggestions.  Chicken, mashed potatoes and pizza were excellent and the lemon pie was just the end all!  We had enough leftovers for a second meal.  Perfect place for a late afternoon meal.  The to go bags are plastic, and made from recycled material - I wish they would switch to paper or compostable bags.  Also, the male host dropped the check before we were finished and before we had the chance to order dessert.",

The place looks like a diner, Denny's like, a little nicer ;) Girls at the front desk, nice enough, but lack hospitality experience. Cocktail so weak, I couldn't taste any liquor. I did ask server about it and was brought then , a crazy strong one. Which is better than not  Server seemed medicated possibly? No personality whatsoever. Could barely hear her speak. Food, the most important part ...right? Mediocre at best. I had Pastrami Sandwich, not much pastrami there, a lot of cheese....pretty much tasteless. My husband  had pizza, it was good, but then it was GF so, not much you can expect there, not the restaurants fault. My one star review really comes form the standpoint , that this place is just another \"concept\" corporate kind of place.  Mediocre everything, that we as consumers , I guess have become accustomed to. Myself, I can come up with many other places to go , regardless the price, that are privately owned, much better vibes, better cocktails, better food , and better service.",
