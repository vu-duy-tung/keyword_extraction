After, no one else came back to check on us. On the other hand, my mom liked her Friday special. She was full. I ate the rest of her plate.  Kinda disappointed in my first visit.  I heard great things about this place.  I saw that Monday special was Juevos Rancheros.  I will have to try that. Also will have to try the freshly squeezed lemonade.  My mom mentioned that she enjoyed the jam and toast.",

    "text": "Mmmm I know everyone raves about Matt's and they aren't necessarily bad, but I don't think they are the best as many may claim.  Let me start off by saying, their service isn't great.  I've been to their original location, before and after the relocation, and now this new one, and hardly ever will you get a smile from anyone working there.  And I've dined there when they've just opened for the day, I've dined a few hours in, I've been there around lunch, on both weekdays and weekends, and smiles have always been, and probably always will be a rarity.  On the bright side, this location did care to ask if we wanted refills for our drinks cause the original location definitely did not.  The food is a little on the pricier side.  Though unfortunately, there isn't much on their menu, and honestly, after not coming to Matt's after all these years, I was expecting to see a little more variety on their menu.  Instead I saw the exact menu I had several years back but now with a little printed insert listing the specials of the day for the week.  In my mind, their saving grace at the original location was the chalkboard, decorated with the special of the day.  Quite unlike the regular menu, it was often something interesting, but this insert was less than interesting that I actually gave it a skip.  Note that whenever a friend dragged me to the original location, I would without a doubt, order the special of the day.  With a side of pancakes.  I guess their food isn't bad, but with all the hype, coupled with less than stellar service, and a menu that hasn't changed all these years, I am a little disappointed.",

Everything from food arriving cold or one time burnt, to waiting almost 45 minutes to get food at all after ordering.    This location is closer to home and so we waiting anxiously for this new location to open... however, once it did it was not the well oiled machine we were used to downtown, far from it.  So we took a few months off and gave it another shot, the last three times we have been here have been great... whatever kinks or growing pains they were having have been worked out and service is now quick and friendly, and the food is on par with the downtown location.     I am a huge fan of Matt's so I held off on writing this review for quite awhile but after another good meal this last Saturday I would now recommend this location.   There is typically a 30-45 minute wait during peak breakfast hours.   I WISH THEY HAD A TEXT BASED RESERVATION SYSTEM... but otherwise solid four stars!",

The manager is a rude fat women that I'm my opinion stares people down as the pay to eat there, other employees weren't attentive, shitty service.   As for the food it was ok.",

It's not a particular expansive establishment, but they managed to make do with what they had. They definitely had an overwhelming amount of patrons. Every table was taken, and there was a prolonged wait.  They have wonderful service, and their food; although not spectacular, was quite tasty. The food selection isn't vast, but what they do offer, they execute quite well.  I had the hog and chick, and my wife had the waffles. She was more enthused about her selection, than I was about mine.   Overall, it was quite a satisfying brunch, supplemented by wonderfully brisk and attentive service.",

Most other places have dry steak for breakfast. The server (who was vegetarian) said the steak was really good. I took a a chance and got it. IT TURNED OUT AMAZING. It was medium rare to perfection. The potatoes were good too. Absolutely recommend this place!",

It was very busy and took about 35 minutes to get a seat for 6, no big deal- I just figured this meant that it was good. The service was friendly enough but they seemed understaffed. It was very busy on this Monday morning after Xmas and our table didn't get much attention (no greeting, no goodbye, only 1 coffee refill, etc). There are no vegan options here. I appreciated that the server knew the hash browns were not vegan but the home fries were. She said the beans were vegan but I could not order them as a side only as part of the chilaquiles meal but since I am vegan, I obviously wasn't going to order that. And then my father in law ordered the chilaquiles and the beans came in a small dish on the side. So I ate home fries and drank coffee. The coffee was good and so were the home fries (I asked for jalapenos and onions to be cooked in with them). The rest of the family enjoyed their meals but wished for more attentive service. I would not go back but I think the meat eaters in the family will!",

What really gets me is that they don't have a kids menu at this location??? Really... for being in such a location that has families surrounding it and to not have a option for kiddos is just outrageous. On the family note again, the food can take sometime and they don't supply any crayons for kids as well. End of the review for me is this place seems more of a place suited for peeps minus children and family kinda joint. Kinda a bummer because my kiddo loved your pancakes and syrup!!!

Large portion, very savory and tasty! However because there was no wifi and I couldn't get the hotspot to work on my mobile phone so I couldn't download the book I wanted to read on my iPad. Server recommended going across the plaza to the coffee shop if I needed wifi.",

    "text": "So we ordered a simple omelet breakfast with hash browns well done. The first time it came out with breakfast potatoes not hash browns so instead of leaving the omelet they took the whole plate back and gave us hashbrowns (not well done) and the same omelet (now Luke warm). We send it back again after I had to get up and find a server becUse it was impossible to signal one even though we were waiting for ten minutes not touching our plate. I get a server someone comes over and says they'll fix it. We get toast (\"on the house\") in the meantime (we had already eaten our 2 orders of toast at this point ). We get our order again with a Luke warm omelet and breakfast potatoes (not hashbrowns). This time they leave the plate and say they'll bring us a side order of the hashbrowns well done. We get Luke warm hash browns not well done. They ask us if it's better and since it's already 1030 and were hungry we just say yes. They only comped the plate not our oj or toast and still charge us 6 bucks. Oh the best part our waitress stopped by once...and wasn't even aware we had sent our food back a second time. We are not picky people but have both been on the restaurant business and know how food should be cooked and customer service should be provided and this is not it.",

Back was the great food I'd experienced at the downtown Matt's during their first months of business. The place was crowded again this past Saturday morning around 8:00 when I arrived, but a True benefit of dining alone is no waiting. The server was pleasant and cheerful and FAST. I was seated at 8:05 ate my delicious pancakes and superb bacon and paid my tab all before 8:35. I'm hoping it stays this fabulous, as the downtown spot fell out of favor with after the first year.",

First of all, the menu is very limited and doesn't leave many options to choose from even for the simplest meal of the day. I got the waffle with bacon and I asked for strawberries with that. Instead of strawberries I received what looked like strawberry jam. The bacon was covered in black pepper-not very appetizing. The service was okay, but I couldn't tell you who my server was as three different people greeted me, served my food, and took my check. Overall, not the best breakfast place in town. I would much rather go elsewhere in the future.",

Great service, especially when I pointed out that the glass I was drinking out of was broken. Food portions huge! Eggs cooked perfectly, however, I like my tortillas crispy and these were soggy. You get a huge portion of potatoes which were good but super greasy! A big side of beans which were meh. I wouldn't order it again but I'll come back to see what else they have since it's cute and good service. Not worth $13 in taste but worth it in the amount they give you so you could share. Homemade ketchup and hot sauce- excellent!",

Well Yelpers I  found the place.... it's tucked away in strip mall were you can drive right passed it ....   We had a short wait (15 mins) which I heard it great for any place that services brunch on a busy Sunday. We were seated my a man who could have been an actor or an actor type....lol....  I immediately ordered a cup of coffee...now we know most places which have a diner feel have the worse coffee...... WELL BLOW ME AWAY....this coffee was so damn good...I have two refills before I actually ordered breakfast....   I ordered scrambled egg whites, home fries with toast and of course BACON......   We waited patiently for our meal and then from the corner of my eye.... I see it.... pure bliss....  The plate looked like a work of art..... my mouth began to water and eyes were tearing...  I couldnt even wait until the cute waitress placed my plate down in from of me. I grabbed the first thing on the plate and by the grace of everything  holy...... it was the BACON..... lite, crispy with freshed cracked pepper on it....   Everything was seasoned well and tasted delicious...the home fries with rosemary and carmalized  onions....Wowwwww!  Look I already have a another day planned for breakfast this week.... I know I may need rehab... I would have given Matts 5 stars but they only serve biscuits on Tuesday's......bummer!",

The staff is super friendly, the vibe is laid back and fun, the food is pretty delicious, and the portions are indeed HUGE!  On a recent visit, I ordered the griddle cakes for the kids and a side of bacon.  Just as I finished taste-testing to make sure all was edible, I started saying that the pancakes are the best in town and my husband was saying the same thing about the bacon!  The kids enjoyed both as well...  I had \"the skinny\" which is a scramble with egg whites, spinach, gruyere cheese, and chicken apple sausage, and comes with a huge side of mixed greens...  We also had a breakfast sandwich, a hog and chick, and the Sunday Steak & Eggs special at our table... Needless to say, it was a ton of food, but those leftovers are going to be great tomorrow!  I'd love to see some fruit and maybe another healthy option on the menu, but this place still rocks... especially if you're looking to fill your belly and you're not counting calories!",

It's nice to see pride taken in the delivery.   High quality ingredients and attention to detail makes it a standout. BUT, not having Heinz Ketchup is a travesty. They go through all the trouble of the execution and high quality ingredients and then cop out at the very end by using a knock off. Otherwise my review would have been 5 stars.",

When I finally stopped someone and asked for more syrup they told me I was going to have to pay $1.50 for another mini-container.  Did not make me happy.

I always ask for bacon extra crispy and it still comes out kinda soggy every time. The eggs Benedict I've had before and again the eggs weren't cooked enough. The hash is fine, and the lemonade is pretty good but if I'm paying that much for breakfast at a place with breakfast in the name...you'd think they could cook an egg how you want it...

I ordered the Hog and the Chick, and the pork chop lacked seasoning. My friend wasn't particularly fond of it either.   I do recommend ordering the strawberry honey lemonade.

    "text": "I remember stumbling into Matt's Big Breakfast years ago when I first arrived by car in Phoenix with my crash mate .. we were hungry and downtown. I was a new Arizonian and Matt's looked like a regular Mom & Pop type of place. Once we found parking, ( this was before downtown really 'arrived' and it was still relatively easy), we ventured to Matt's and surprisingly found this long line! That kind of thing always intrigues me, so we waited awhile and thus, my first Matt's experience was born. I remember it being very good, basic, but good. Low and behold when I was in my old neighborhood recently getting my hair blow dried up, over and out , I met up with that same bestie crash mate and we re-visited Matt's. Only HERE, in Camelback. Yes. The long line does still exist, even at this location. No matter what time of day, as I have been to said blow dry bar often, and I always see a line at Matt's! Take note: that means it's good! Basic breakfast foods await you at Matt's. The Hog and Chick is my personal favorite. It's simple and it's good : Two eggs any way, ( I go for poached); home fried potatoes ; a thick slab of bacon; toast of any liking and their homemade jam! Matt's uses high quality, local & organic , when possible on most of their items. Since I am not a fan of what GMO's have done to us Americans... I look for that anywhere and any chance I can get it , is a plus. The coffee is ever flowing as is the H2O for us parched desert people. The juice is fresh squeezed. What more can I say? Matt's is simple , basic and takes it to the level of greatness without really having to try. NOW, as someone who loves to linger over a Bloody Mary or Mimosa at a weekend brekky? I would LOVE to see Matt's bring those two things to their city restaurants. They haven't. The Bacon Bloody Mary does exist at the PHX Sky Harbor location...& it's amazeballs. Maybe in the future! Matt's has done something right... simple is good.. being basic is awesome.",

Do a few things \"great\" and people will come back. I think it's more about a lack of decent breakfast choices for the Biltmore area.  PRO: The wait was only 15mins during a holiday. Bacon was VERY good. Great service and high quality napkins. 100% pure maple syrup and raw sugar. CON: Their coffee, eggs, hash browns, sausage links, waffles, and pancake was just average.  If I was in the area, I would go again. However, being 25 miles away from Glendale/Peoria, I'd stick with U.S. Egg, IHOPs, or Ronnie's Cafe.",

Service was more production oriented - more like a breakfast factory than a place to relax and enjoy. Servers were more involved with entertaining each other than ensuring guests were enjoying their meal.   Granted, we came in late (1:30ish) and staff was intent on sweeping the floors, clanging silverware for roll ups, just not consumer friendly. The food was good/ok, but nothing special.   Some of the server uniforms were disgusting filthy - AND obviously not from one or 2 shifts. Atmosphere is about as basic as a government cafeteria...  Try snooze or Breakfast Kitchen Bar in Scottsdale Quarter; Matt's place belongs in metro center.",

I gave this a 3 star because the menu is extremely limited. We also weren't told before hand that they don't separate checks. It's 2017, it might be time to invest in POS software that allows for that. Plus, how hard could it possibly be to just enter the food into separate orders to create separate checks? Kind of ridiculous if you ask me. Lastly, the hash browns I received were terribly salty to the point I couldn't eat them.  Overall, it was ok but I was really not impressed.",

As we didn't have anything else going on, we waited the 30 mins for a table, but they really move the crowd along so dont be too intimidated....  Well worth the wait! The freshly squeezed honey lemonade was outstanding. Menu relatively limited which was great as everything looked great. No salami scramble for me :( [next time...trying to be good] We both had the super yummy 'Skinny' which comes with a fresh and light side salad which was great, but our table neighbors hash browns looked incredibly crispy!  Even though MBB was busy with a long seating waiting list, we never felt rushed by our server. They are a very well managed eating establishment. Interior design aesthetic is fresh, fun and modern. My only personal preference, with counter seating and hightop tables options I would rather not sit at a lower table and would be willing to wait longer until either of those choices became available.  Will def. be back! Outside of the downtown Scottsdale area, Arcadia is pretty underserved for great breakfast spots so a great location for us. Parking is easy. We regularly attend swim meets at Phoenix Swim Club/Phoenix Country Day school, the close proximity means the kids can have a 'great feed' as they open at 630am or better yet, we can go there after we drop them off for warm ups!",

The check was dropped off about 3 minutes after our food was served. I hadn't even tried a bite of everything on my plate yet. Before we had even finished the meal, forks were in hand, they asked if we were done eating. It definitely felt like we were being rushed out of the restaurant.

    "text": "Brian's Big Disappointing Breakfast   Guess my high expectations got the best of me? Been wanting to try MBB for a while now (long while since DDD!), but this first visit was sad.  Had pork chop, eggs, and hash browns. I asked them to make the hash browns crispy. They came out extra soggy. Couldn't figure out if it was grease or water, I didn't finish them.  I asked for over easy eggs, they came out over medium plus. And my sister asked for home fries, she got hash browns. The pork chop was alright.  Service was good, but if you see brown on top of the eggs, they are most likely not over-easy.   I'm sure they would have corrected everything, but it should come out right the first time, especially if there are only 3 other tables seated. I've only sent my food back twice that I can remember (once was a $50 over cooked steak).  $27.58 plus tip for two entrees and one coffee for an ok breakfast. Thumbs down. Had way better at Ronnie's Cafe for a third of the price!  My sister flew in from out of town and I wish I would have treated her to Snooze or Daily Dose or even First Watch instead. Thought this place was bomb for nom nom, but much the opposite.  The ambience and decor are fabulous.   And please tell the manager to stop saying 'you guys'.  It's unprofessional.   Glad people like it, but I won't be back.   Sincerely,  Unimpressed",

Try to get there before 9am because a line will start forming! I love that they use whole and natural ingredients and even make their own berry preserves and ketchup. The service is also fast and staff are great and friendly. The main reason I don't absolutely loooove Matt's is because the food never \"wows\" me. It's meat, potatoes, and eggs. (Although the homefries are awesome with little bits of fresh rosemary and herbs) They have rotating specialty items every day of the week and I would love to try their eggs benedict or biscuits and gravy but I work full time and will never make it on a Monday or Tuesday.",

I ordered coffee, the waitress asked if I wanted creamer and I said yes. A few minutes later she brings my boyfriend's lemonade and a water. She leaves immediately. I thought to get my coffee, but she never came back. We attempted for about 10 minutes to flag her down, but she just kept walking past us. We tried flagging another waiter down but were unsuccessful. Finally got her attention and I asked where the coffee was. She walked away and brought me the coffee. Didn't say a word. We placed our order and didn't see anyone else until our food came. They brought us the wrong order. They fixed it quickly. After they dropped off the food, we did not see our waitress until later when she dropped off the check. Not once did she ask if we needed a refill or anything else.  My boyfriend wanted more water, then he noticed a hair intertwined in the ice. We paid the check and left.   It was no way to start our Sunday. We won't be returning, definitely not to this location.",

My request for MW were so on point, I realized I couldn't remember the last time I'd been to a restaurant where I actually had them at perfection! Anyhow, I met with one of my Clients here and Parker took our order. Loved his personality and helped me pick out the best sausage and potatoes which were DELISH! And let's have a moment to brag about the bacon, peppery, not overly crispy or chewy, brings tears to your eyes all around ridiculously and wonderful tasting bacon! I love bacon!  While we were sitting there I notice a couple of other gals, Andrea and Becca, helping out the table. I looked around and notice that the servers all seem to help each other out so we always had someone near by, someone cleaning off our table or pouring more drinks for us, and also a nice conversation with both Parker and Andrea. These 3 were good peeps and I do hope the management appreciates how well they took care of us. And now that I know I can get the freaken perfect bacon and eggs as well as know my Client will be happy, I will use this place as another addition in my back pocket. Thank you so much for making my Friday!",

There wasn't really a combo that did it for me. A lot of good looking food on the daily special list, problem is, you'd have to come that specific day. Today's daily specials were steak and eggs and jalapeno hash thingy. They just ran out of steaks I was told. Made the decision easier. I got jalapeno hash thingy. The food was OK. It was well executed, but nothing jumped out to me as being special, or deserving of the hype.  Would possibly go back if in the neighborhood, more likely if a daily special was one that seemed exciting. I'm not near Matt's and there was nothing here that made it worth the drive.",

Wife had the bacon and I opted for the ham ($1.00 extra). It was well worth it. Breakfast was delicious and the ham was pretty much a bone in dinner slice of ham. Opted for the home fries and the potatoes were not greasy at all. Some of the best coffee I had at a breakfast joint in a while. The place is a little industrial looking with the metal tables and chairs. The staff was helpful and polite. Had a very nice first meal here. Will definitely be back.",

Simple menu, simple operation, and everything we ordered was hot, fresh, so good, we ate too much, worth it though. Waffle, delicious, bacon perfect, coffee excellent, it was flawless, and the service was genuine, such a pleasure to discover a non chain feel (so done with chainy experience) I cannot wait to return to Matts again.

Staff was great, which made the experience, however for the hype, the food was good, if not basic, also everything is very heavy on the oil and butter, making the meals quite greasy.

I started by eating at his original location in downtown Phoenix, and have since eaten at  both the airport location and the 32nd St. and Camelback location (the one I frequent the most). I usually get The Skinny, which is an egg white scramble with sausage and gruyere cheese. It also comes with a spinach salad with a very light dressing. I usually ask them to go light on the cheese. The best part about the meal is that they use Schreiner's sausage mixed into the scramble. Schreiner is a local company that has been around for years at seventh Street and Osborne. 5/5.   My guest had the Salami Scramble. Again, the eggs are organic and locally sourced. In addition, the salami is procured from Schreiner's sausage. It came with a generous portion of hashbrowns, and whole wheat toast with homemade jam. 5/5.  The ambience is fantastic because the walls contain a painting of old school Phoenix. Included in the mural is the Graham's Fruit Stand at 36th Street and Camelback, which I used to frequent as a kid. It is since been leveled and replaced with townhomes (bummer). It brings back great memories and makes me proud to be a native. Next time you are yelping and looking for a place to eat breakfast, look no more and definitely stop here for a visit!",

    "text": "It goes a little something like this we waited for someone to wait on us as other people we're sat as well, people who were sat after us had drinks and order taken. Still we did not get waited on, after about 10min (as we watched the wait staff walk around in circles) the lady who sat us asked if anyone has waited in us. She took our order and left, another wait staff brought us our food. As I am sitting waiting for food the gentleman next to us who also has been waiting to have his order taken has been sitting there for about 15 min. He was sat at the same thing as other people that already had their food. He had to get up several times and ask for help. We wanted to order a side and wait staff never came by to ask us if we were doing good or if we needed any thing else. Finally we asked to talk with a manager, come to find out that the lady who sat us was the manager. We did let her know what kind of service we we're getting and she said\" what do you want me to do about it? I took you're order I'm the manager and I did not have to do that.\" \"we are really busy right now.\" I just witnessed the wait staff standing around and walking in circles. The manager could have handled this better. As for the one star that is because the food was good. There is alot more to this story but I just hope if you decide to try Matt's big breakfast you have a better experience.",

We came in around noon and it was pretty packed, luckily they had one last booth available for 2. We got seated fast, shortly got our order taken and our food came in no time!   We both ordered the Hog & Chick (eggs, potatoes, bacon and toast). It was great!! Especially the bacon! Super thick cut and they gave 3 slices which is awesome. Oh yes, and the toast with jam was a pleasant surprise too! They gave fresh jelly that had pretty much whole blueberries in it! Soooo good. The whole plate was -BIG- and for under $10 for those quality ingredients, it was totally worth it! I'll definitely be back to try other signature dishes.   Also, the service was great, we were checked up on by multiple people who were all so nice. The ambience had a typical diner feel, but more modern.  Five stars easily!!",

When we were ready to go our server just threw us the check in a very disrespectful manner.

I'm a fan of the Five Spot, which is a tasty breakfast sandwich in a restaurant setting for a similar price to what you would expect to pay at McDonalds.  The reason why I'm giving 3 stars here is service.  The service was about what I would expect to receive at McDonalds.  Actually, McDonalds generally treats me better, so I shouldn't bash Mickey D's.  I asked if there was an alcohol menu (hey, I was there with a bunch of nightshifters hoping to have a pleasant bloody mary with my eggs before going to sleep for the day) and got raised eyebrows, a stare, and a short \"no.\"  Our group also received an abrasive \"we don't do individual checks\" from our waitress as she handed over the check - despite the fact that we hadn't asked for individual checks.  Not a \"hey, did you have a good meal, is there anything else we can help you with?\"  No smile.  If a meal is truly extraordinary I'll excuse a bit of rough attitude (ex: most french restaurants).  Matt's Big Breakfast is good, but it isn't unique enough out of all the great valley breakfast options to make me put up with the attitude.",

Came in here and ordered the Thursday daily special: Classic Eggs Benedict with choice of potatoes.  Got the home fries of course.  The hollandaise sauce was way too thick and the muffin wasn't toasted.  Home fries portion was about half of what it should have been.  For 15 bucks the meal was not executed well enough to justify the cost.  This was the third time I've been here and left unsatisfied.    I'm probably not coming back to this location again.",

The sausage and back are seasoned with a lot of black pepper so it can get a little hot on the tastebuds. I prefer the ham over sausage and probably the bacon as well, though it was tasty and huge strips if bacon. Hashbrowns were very good, home fries were ok, I wouldn't order them again. Cute simple decor, hard chairs but it helps with turning tables. I paid $1.50 for a side of syrup- that was strange to me. I didnt use hardly any of it, so if I would have, then it wouldn't have bothered me so much, but next time they can keep the syrup. Note I didnt have a waffle or pancake, but still surprising. I would go back again.",

I ordered the Hog&Chick  SUPER extra crispy hashbrowns as my usual. First they brought me the wrong plate all together,  next the hashbrowns were NOT crispy. Barely a crunch to the outer layer and soggy soup for the inner layer, cooked on too hot of a grill is my guess.  Next, the table near us didn't get the right plate then when he did, his eggs were over easy not over medium as he ordered. Lastly a lady across the room received her waffle with no butter, what's a waffle with no butter?!!! It was around 7am on a Saturday so it wasn't actually busy, I can't imagine what a mess it might turn into when it gets busier.  On the plus side Ruby our waitress was very gracious and very very AMAZING!!! I've been on her side and it's never easy but she took it in stride.",

My favorite dishes are the steak and eggs (steak is always perfectly cooked) and the chorizo cheddar jalapeno scramble special. I don't think you can go wrong with any of the menu options, and the portions live up to the name. Matt's modest focus on serving great food is a strong contrast to Scottsdale brunch spots that are more style over substance. More than likely we'll be right back here again next week!",

Their griddle cakes come with 2 ounces of syrup only and you have to pay for more syrup if you need it, when speaking with the manager told her they didn't taste like anything she said they use only simple ingredients: eggs, flour and sugar  No vanilla... no taste and needed to keep asking for more butter but again not enough syrup for these very dense pancakes.  From the response from the manager not going back.. she did not offer to make it right and they weren't cheap",

The place is small, crowded and noisy, but to be fair, there was a large party of large and noisy people seated next to us.  Our server was sweet.  We knew her from another local dining spot, so we chatted a bit.  She was a big fan of Fox restaurants.  So are we.  But this was Matt's, not that other place.    Service was excellent, food was pretty good, ambiance just so-so.  I really don't get places that think the Industrial look with zero sound insulation is a good idea.  Nobody can hear their table mates talking, so they just talk louder.  For someone like me (hearing impaired), it makes it really difficult to have any conversation whatsoever.  I usually just take my hearing aids out and wink and blow kisses at my wife now and then.  Once I missed and I got a really weird look from the hotty soccer mom that was staring at me from the other booth.  I didn't tell my wife.",

    "text": "Quite unremarkable. I don't understand the attraction.  I've wanted to try Matt's for a long time. I had heard that they had great Belgian waffles, so perhaps my expectations were high. They were not met. The waffle was served with cold/hard butter - impossible to spread on a waffle. I was hoping for a crispy-on-the-outside - tender-on-the-inside waffle. It wasn't bad... just not what I had hoped for. Served with three strips of peppery, peppery, did I say \"peppery\" bacon. I am not a fan of pepper bacon, but what made it worse, was that it was limp and barely cooked. It was also served (as stated in the menu) with 2 oz. of Pure Maple Syrup. It wasn't enough syrup for the size of the waffle, so I asked for a bit more. Whoa! - That would be an extra $1.50 charge! I declined.  When the waitress stopped to see how things were, I stated my disappointment at the food and the up charge. She left the table and told no one. What appeared to be a manager also stopped by the table. Again, I voiced my displeasure. She left and told the female owner who returned to my table (a plus for communication). The owner said she would take the bacon off the bill (this was also a big plus).   Then, unfortunately, she proceeded to justify why they charged for more syrup; how much it costs and the long process it takes to produce a small amount of Real Maple Syrup (NOT a plus). I said that I understood the \"economics\" of it; I just felt that in this day and age of drink refills, etc. that it was not the greatest of customer service. She continued to argue and state how long she had been a restaurant owner, etc., etc. I was not interested. I WOULD have been interested if she had simply acknowledged my feelings and apologized for the fact that I wasn't satisfied.  In the end, she told me she would take care of the bill. This might have been a plus, but she said it with such disdain, that it literally left a bad taste in my mouth. (I DID leave a tip for the server)  Note to servers, managers and owners: Don't argue with the customer - you will never will the battle, or win us over. Don't try to justify your prices/service/problems, etc. - we don't want to hear the reasons why. We want you to ACKNOWLEDGE the fact that we are not happy. Simply LISTEN - then tell us you are sorry our experience wasn't better.  If you can do or offer something to make it better, GREAT!  But do it with a smile. Kill us with kindness - not contempt.",

    "text": "I just made my final visit at this location. I ordered about month ago, I called in and when I came to pick it up, I saw there was only about 6 people in the restaurant but I waited to get my breakfast I had called in 20min earlier... The girl was nice about it so I wrote it off. BUT today was unacceptable. I called in my order and was told 15 min, I came in and my food was waiting, while waiting 2 older gentlemen came in and right after them a group of 6 came in. The manager came up, gave the other guy waiting his to go order and grabbed her clip board to help the people who walked in 4 min after me.  I would really hate to think that is was because I am a black women and everyone else was caucasian, but that what it felt like. I asked the manager after she looked past me to talk to the man standing next to me, \"is someone one going to help me, I've been waiting and I need to get back to work?\". She said \"Oh we just have some many people, I'm sorry\". Not genuine at all and after leaving the parking lot and attempting to go to the ATM I noticed I didn't have my debit card. I had to go back and the same women was at the counter and when I told her she didn't give me my debit card she explain to me where she had laid it down with my receipts to sign, well she pointed to the right of the register when I actually signed on the left and she had every excuse to get me out of there.  Its really unfortunate that people are rude and discriminate against loyal customers. I will continue to visit the semi-org Matt's on 1st st but this location has lost my business and I will not refer any of my colleagues or friends here. The food is good but not enough for me to be treated like a second class citizen, my money is the same color as everyone else's, she didn't have a problem with taking it.",

I loved the decor and fresh flowers in the tables, it wasn't too trendy or trying to hard. You seat yourself. It has a very small business feel to it. The staff was friendly and attentive. I saw a manager on the floor all morning working with them. The food was pretty good - again, this isn't Snooze, so don't expect anything out of this world crazy. Think basic omelettes and waffles.  They have a rotating daily special: Monday's are huevo rancheros, another day is biscuits and gravy, ect.  I think my family's disappointment came with the price - they charge a lot for little things. An extra side of syrup cost an additional $1.50. That just seemed ridiculously expensive. My dad thought it was a marketing ploy to make the pancakes a little dry purposefully so you'd have to order more syrup. Dorky MBA family humor. But seriously. A dollar and a half for a little dinky thing of syrup is too much.",

The wait staff was pleasant and the coffee was terrific. Classic eggs benedict was the special and I was so looking forward to it. Sadly, the eggs benedict was inedible. The poached eggs were cooked all the way through, the Canadian bacon was dried out and there was no hollandaise to speak of. Home fries were soggy and tired. My plate was picked up basically untouched. The wait staff didn't ask and I didn't volunteer what the problem was as we just wanted to leave. My companions had a very average breakfast with soggy bacon. The bill was pretty high. Needless to say, we won't go back. Such a disappointment. The place is really cute.",

    "text": "Visited on  a Sunday morning around noon and they had line of people waiting for tables. We must have waited for about 15 minutes before we were seated. The girl at the front was very polite and professional. Our server was amazing and continued to check on us throughout our meal to make sure we were comfortable and happy with our meal. It was a second time for me and first time for my husband. I ordered Cheese Omelet (with extra mushrooms and onions) with the side of Hashbrown, Wheat toast and Blueberry jelly with some iced tea. My husband ordered the special of that day which was scrambled eggs with spinach and bacon with the side of Hashbrown, Sourdough toast and Strawberry jelly and their freshly squeezed Orange Juice. The orange juice was very sweet (little too sweet for my preference) but tasted really great. The server brought our drinks in 5 minutes and food came about 10 minutes later. My omelet was very delicious, hash browns were greasy, both jellies were great but Blueberry is my favorite, less sweeter than the Strawberry one. My husband's eggs were too salty. Their bacon slices are nice and thick and extra peppery. Their customer service was great, their prices are a little pricey for their Breakfast menu, if one ends up ordering extra such as mushrooms, peppers or onions for their eggs, the price can go higher pretty quick. Taking 2 stars away for making the food salty and for the price of items, limited menu, loud place. There is no presentation to the food, please ignore the zig zag of ketchup (that was my creation!).  They can definitely work on the menu, their presentation and may be their prices. Time will tell how much they really pay attention to their customer reviews.",

It was more like: perfectly flakey biscuit smothered in chunks of sauces with just enough gravy. Someomes this combo can be runny, mushy, taste too fried, or be far too heavy. This dish was none of those. Instead, it's everything you want it to be. Tasty, great texture, and a little spicy. So good!",

I can make sausage gravy and biscuits at home that would be far superior to what was served. My eggs were also disappointing. Over Medium were almost hard yokes but still with runny white.

    "text": "Second disappointing experience at this place in a row.  This time was just poor service by the wait staff who seemed more focused on talking to one another at the coffee bar than visiting their tables.    After sitting down, someone did visit my table to bring me a water.  From that point onward, not a single server visited my table even though my menu was still in front of me and my water was empty.  Servers would pass by without checking in and, at one point, a server even walked by muttering \"waiting, eating, waiting...\" to all of the tables including mine and the one next to mine even though neither of our tables had ordered anything.    After about 15 minutes of waiting, I got up and walked out.  As I was leaving, my server (though I really have no idea since no one really served my table) said, \"Hope you enjoyed breakfast, have a great day.\"  I couldn't tell but I don't think she was being ironic.  I walked out to First Watch and had a much better experience.  Will not be back.",

The wait staff was atrocious.  It was painfully obvious that our waitress would have rather been anywhere else.  After we received our food, my mother in law asked for butter for her toast and the waitress actually argued with her about it, saying that her toast had enough butter and she didnt need anymore.  And then she didnt bother to  check on us for the duration of our visit.  If you're going to have such shitty staff, you should have some pretty awesome food to counter.  It is not okay to have mediocre food and terrible staff.",

    "text": "After spending a whole year thinking Matt's Big Breakfasts logo was too similar to Whataburgers to be coincidence, I finally decided to go out on a limb and check it out. Turns out, the decor is cute and simple...sort of farm house-y. Definitely not what I was expecting! I came around 10am by myself since it was a pit stop before Safeway. The place is always packed, and this morning was no exception. Thankfully, there were some seats at the \"bar\" - perfect for solo diners. It took exactly 14 minutes for anyone to acknowledge me, and I only point that out because everyone else around me got greeted etc. almost immediately.  I got my order in - the waffle with bacon - and it came out in a flash. I can definitely tell that everything here is fast fast fast. Their menu is not painfully extensive, and they cover the basics and have a sprinkle of unique dishes. Everything looked pretty food, and I would consider coming back to try something else.  My actual meal was delicious. I wouldn't go all out and say it was the best waffle ever, but it was pretty darn up there. The portion was pretty spot on. Looking around, I'd say that everyone else had plenty of food on their plates. Their bacon is thick cut, peppery, crispy on the edges, perfectly fatty, aaaand I need to stop because my mouth is watering.   Overall, food was good, and the prices are reasonable. I would also note that they don't have alcohol (if that's a concern).",

I was surprised there was hardly a wait at 9 on a Saturday. I soon realized why... this visit was so disappointing. My husband ordered his hashbrowns extra crispy, they came soggy and my waffle was cold. The waitress seemed perplexed, even when I pointed out the butter wasn't melting, even after spreading it out. The second waffle was ok, just no crispy edges like I remembered. Regardless, there was no apology, not even an acknowledgement. My bacon was too burnt to eat (and I love extra crispy bacon). In the end, we left our meals half eaten and moved on with the day. I feel bad for having recommended this place to friends. It's so completely overrated.",

    "text": "Sunday Morning Hunger. What to eat? Sore from the day's prior activities knowing another two mile trek under 100 degree heat to Cardinals Stadium...   Matt's is close to the Embassy Suites on Camelback so Matt's it was.   I told the waitress that I underestimated the food here. She replied with a smile, \"it's called Matt's Big Breakfast.\" I retorted, McDs has a \"Big Breakfast\" too. Plus many restaurants tout \"generous\" portions like highly disappointing Stacks in Irvine (OC, CA). I mean/suppose Stacks and McD's portions are large if you are a damn elf!  Service: A Staff is helpful & informative. There is no designated waitstaff. Just holla (politely cause the girls are cute/hot) at anyone. The ice water is refreshing & the coffee was piking hot that needed ice to chill.   Location: A Located next to a market so the parking can be crowded. Especially after 9am. I came earlier b4 everything else was open so parking was cool. Although there was an idiot prius (see pic) that decided to park in front cause he was too stupid to realize there were spots 10 steps away or too lazy to park and walk another whopping 30 steps for whatever he had to do.  Decor/Interior: A/B Metro-ish, Kinda confused w/ industrial.  My visit was filled with older patrons so if it looked like Dennys, that would've suffice.   Food: C Generally, Matt's secret is sugar & butter. Any trained baker would recognize this (I'm an accountant & also a non-practicing baker & bartender).  Hash Browns: A  Commercialized but it was bomb!  Crittercake (Pancakes): C Filling yet bland. Take the sugar and butter over-dose and all you taste is milky flour. Nothing special like cinnamon, or anything like that. The cakes are super hearty. The size is deceiving and much larger than it appears.   Waffle: C My assessment is flawed because I requested no powdered sugar. However, powdered sugar was added but rather than give me a new one, the cook just dusted as much as he can off the one side and flipped it over. The uninitiated eater wouldn't have noticed but when I'm eating, utilizing my sensitive (and trained) palette for flavors, I am focused and in deep initiated. The sweetness in my mouth spiked. I wondered why and flipped the summabeech upside down and bam. That was not cool and (politely) had this convo with the manager who reconciled the situation. She asked me if I wanted another and my face was like =O i have no more space. The waffle was perfectly crafted with the perfect amount of time under the George Foreman Grill (or whatever machine they used).   Bacon (thick cut): A+++ the waffle came with two generous sized thick cut bacon. The source of this bacon deserves a trophy. The bacon was sooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooooo goooooood~!   Steak n' Eggs: A I didn't order this but i tried it. The overall steak was too salty for me, but when my brain disregards the seasoning flavors, the meat was pure. This is off-menu and may appear as the \"Dish of the Day\" (or some gimmicky name similar thereof).   Toast: A It's not toast, but more like breadstick toasts. Not saying they are stingy here. The toast had a ton of butter on the sourdough but the bread used was an excellent choice.  Jelly: A Here is a little trick for you. Rather than douse your cakes or waffles with syrup, just use a little syrup mixed with the thick jelly they provide here. It will provide an alternative experience for your palette.   Overall: A As mentioned above. Use butter and powdered sugar & this is their secret. If you get bisquick, add the right amount of butter & powdered sugar, then you get Matt's pancakes and waffles at home. The point is that it makes no sense to go to boutique eatery just to eat pan-fried bread with butter and sugar. However, this does not mean Matt's Big Bfast as a restaurant sucks. This is a great joint & i will return.",

What next?  Charging for an extra squirt of ketchup?  The food overall is solid but they should rethink this policy. Why put a bad taste in customers' mouths over a buck?",

I got the Salami and eggs with home fries and tortillas.   The salami was excellent.    The eggs were cooked perfectly.   The home fries were great.   My wife got the cheese omelette with hash browns and toast.   The omelette looked average,  but then again a cheese omelette is kind of plane.   Hash browns liked like normal hash browns.   I recommend the home fries.     The toast and homemade strawberry jam are a must.   The people next to us got the ham steak and bacon.   They looked great.     Next time I may just get eggs with toast and bacon because everything will be awesome.",

My husband ordered the waffle and when he asked for additional syrup the server told us that it would be a $1.50 extra.  He declined the extra syrup and said that it was ridiculous.  When the hostess stopped by the table to ask us how we were doing we told her about the syrup.  She did not handle the interaction well, I pointed out that other restaurants never charge for extra syrup and she basically blew me off and said \"we are not like anyone else, and if we did that we would have the raise the prices.\"  You would be far better off with a price increase.  It became apparent after that, when we received our check immediately,  that someone wanted us to leave because we complained.    This will be our first and last time eating at Matt's.  They can keep their Vermont Maple Syrup, which by the way is not $75 a jug.",

There was only four of us and it was too difficult for them to split the bill. We thought it was just the server the first time we went but same thing happened the second time too. They said their software wasn't capable. We then asked them to pretend we each were a table of one; they still couldn't figure that one out. Sorry but not everyone can afford to front the bill and expect their friends to remember to get cash out and pay them back.  They also charge you almost $2 for an extra tiny bottle of syrup. That better be straight from a maple tree grown in the back of the restaurant, haha!",

I bring everyone here - family, friends, people from out of town simply because it's a place I know everyone will like.   Unfortunately, I was very disappointed when I came in for brunch the other day. I had the special for the day - scrambled eggs with ham, home fries and wheat bread. The ham wasn't anything great and the home fries were even worse. Matt's home fries used to be my ultimate favorite breakfast potatoes and has inspired me to make a copy cat version of it at home. The home fries I had that day was nowhere near what I was used to. They tasted like they were made earlier that morning and was just reheated in the microwave. They tasted old. My boyfriend and I shared pancakes and what used to be the best pancakes in Phoenix was mediocre. The service as usual was just okay - I've always thought that they were lacking in this department. I don't think I'd come back - there are too many amazing brunch places in the area that are well worth the money.",

You have to wait outside as the return to is small and not enough space to wait inside. The hostess staff are always very nice and accommodating. Servers are hit or miss.

He even scored a souvenir t-shirt (although there's some question that he'll ever wear it.   On this early morning, the place was 1/3 full with locals; always a positive sign of good food.  There are about 20 tables, plus a few outside in this strip mall location.   Service was quick, efficient, if a bit brusque.   I tried the Hog & Chick - Two eggs, with bacon & sourdough toast. I passed on the potatoes, which are included.   Eggs fried perfectly sunny side up, with yolk thickened but not hard.  The bacon is peppered and thick cut, in nice big slices.  A cup of strawberry jam is served with the bread - tart and thick, almost like a compote.  Delicious on that sourdough.   Amy had The Skinny - Four egg whites scrambled with gruyere cheese and baby spinach and chunks of chicken apple sausage.  Instead of bread, sliced tomatoes.  The scramble was light and fluffy, spinach al dente.  The sausage added a little texture, adding an earthy but not overpowering taste.   Matt's is on the expensive side for every day breakfast, but there are a number of other great choices on the menu and the food is good enough to justify the cost.  Recommended.",

The waffle had good flavor but was chewy..portions were really on the small side. With four of us the favorite was the breakfast potatoes and fresh squeezed orange juice. Don't get me wrong it was a good breakfast just not spectacular like before",

    "text": "Let's get the basics out of the way: 1. Chairs are wide and strong enough to hold big bodies like mine. They're metal so try not to scrape the floor when pulling out/in.  2. Plenty of space between tables to maneuver through the place.   Now for the food: Portions are large so split between two of you don't want to waste or take leftovers. I ordered the Hog and Chick and asked the server to make \"scrambled eggs as soft as legally possible.\" And they were great!  But as I mentioned earlier, portions are large so I didn't finish.   I had link sausages which were a bit sweet and off-tasting so those were added to my friend's doggie bag. One of my friends ordered the bacon and it came out too rubbery so these were added to the doggie bag.   I didn't taste the jam or jelly because I don't like jelly on my sourdough toast. You receive only one slice of bread so make it last.   The hash browns covered the plate and were seasoned well.   The service was efficient and friendly and there was no attitude when I asked for a plate to separate my food.   I would return just because I love the chairs and the service. Thanks Matt's workers!",

The seating was a little too crowded for me, it felt like I was eating at a warehouse. The ambiance is a little too relaxed so don't come over dressed. There is no bar so come in with your gym clothes and chill-ax. That's pretty much the vibe you get. Void be a great place if they just give there venue a bit more TLC and update the look. The food I ordered was delightful so I would definitely come back for that. The server was a bit snappy but maybe she was just overwhelmed because she was running everywhere but the staff was very friendly overall. A cute little hole in the wall with a chill vibe for sure",

Even though it was a Saturday morning and there was a line, we were inside and seated within 5 minutes. Staff was very friendly and attentive as ive come to expect.   I decided on the salami scramble with hashbrowns and my wife got The Five Spot. I am so sold on the quality of the ingredients so i know that each dish will taste like the platonic ideal of that item...i.e. Eggs, toast, coffee.   Really enjoyed my meal...the salami gave the scramble a distinctive savory taste, a combo that works so well. Loved the preserves so much i ordered more toast.  Elevated quality and great service makes MBB at the top of its class.",

    "text": "Stopped in here for breakfast yesterday after picking up my daughter from the airport because she wanted to go to Matt's to get the waffle.   I had never been to this location, only to the one downtown before and after it removed from a small place to another. When I had gone to the one downtown, the breakfast wasn't bad.  This experience, I couldn't say the same. Our server was not what I would call a friendly person. She came to take our order. I was giving my order, and she was asking questions. My daughter thought that she was done asking me questions and started giving her order. The server rudely told her, without smiling, that she wasn't done with me.  And gave her a withering look for effect.  I was a bit taken aback by the way she said it. I think my daughter was as well.  As you can see from my photographs, I would say this restaurant is not all about presentation. Do you see the color of my hashbrowns? It had a gray-ish pallor and looked unappetizing. Perhaps the color was from shredding the potatoes and having them exposed to air before cooking?  My daughter had also ordered the hashbrowns, but the server said they were not ready. When they did come, they were what I would consider regular color for the potatoes. That reinforced my thought that my potatoes were the last of the bunch that they had peeled and grated previously.  My eggs were not anything to write home about.  It was the cheese omelette. Rather bland tasting. I doctored it with hot sauce and ketup. Still blind tasting.  I tried my daughter's waffle. Mehhh.  It was  all right.   There was nothing special about the food nor the presentation and especially the service. There are too many other places that have great breakfast and good service. I don't think I will be coming back.",

In which I understood completely. The manager did not handle the complaint well. Instead of just apologizing and letting it be, she kept stating other people's reviews and statements instead of just apologizing. She kept trying to defend the restaurant like our bad experience didn't happen in which made our experience even worse by coming to the table to express her option additionally after the complaint was already made. When the rest of the table was not involved with the complaint. This caused the rest of the group a horrible experience at this location.   Manager just assumed the entire table felt the same as one that complained to her. Made the comment \"I was going to give you a gift certificate, but since you said you aren't coming back I don't want to waste it.\"   Just because one person is complaining about the issues they saw doesn't mean the whole table feels this way. I did not feel like I was not going to come back, but now I don't even feel welcome to come back ever again.   The food is good and the servers are nice and busy. The manager needs to learn to problem solve more rather then become the problem.   I recommend to not state your problems to the management, because instead of taking the complaint and learning from it (like other successful businesses), she will just fight with you about it and try to win. Not worth it.",

Just a little tip, the honey lemonade is delicious and so refreshing in this AZ heat. I had the 5 Spot breakfast sandwich minus the onions so it was just a soft roll, egg, bacon and American cheese with a side of hash browns  and my husband had the waffle that came with two strips of bacon. The food came out quick and it was very filling.  The atmosphere is casual, comfortable and very welcoming. Service is friendly and very efficient. Don't miss out on checking out this little gem.

Flavors were fabulous and portions were huge. I think success has meant a lot of watering down. A while back I ate in the airport terminal and had a bad experience which I attributed to the rush of dealing with airport traffic but the pork chop I had this morning was dry and tough here at the Biltmore location. My wife complained about her's as well and for the same reason.   She declared her hash browns average but loved the toast and home made jelly. I thought the home fries were fabulous with lots of onion and nice crispy brown edges on the potatoes. So good. The iced tea was great and the servers kept my glass filled so that was good. Other than the dried out chop, the food was fine. My real problem is that it simply isn't as great as it used to be. The experience is kind of like the candy bar as big as your head that you used to get for $.99, but now it is a third the size for the same price. You're not disappointed because, you know, chocolate, but it just doesn't measure up to what used to be...   We kind of decided it's not really worth the wait.",

    "text": "General rule of thumb: condescension toward your customers is never a good look, but if you're going to try it anyway, your quality better be damn good. Unfortunately, at Matt's it was just ok. Want half and half in your coffee? Prepare for a lecture from the waitress (who has been alive for fewer years than I have been drinking coffee) about how they only offer whole milk, but it's organic and you will be surprised by how delicious it is if you give it a try. Want salami in your omelet instead of ham? They charge $5 extra because the salami is \"really high quality.\" Never mind that the salami scramble on the menu costs less than an omelet with ham.   Sometimes there are really legitimate reasons why restaurants can't fulfill a customer request, but here it's just pretension. Next time I'll be having my breakfast at a place that asks me how I'd like my coffee instead of telling me how I should.",

For whatever reason the manager came over to check out my pick up order. So he walks over, looks me up and down, and gives me a very judgemental look. Then as I was paying he would not look me in the eye and used a very disgruntled tone. Did my business annoy you somehow? I literally was in the actual restaurant for 2 minutes and yet I walked away this bad.   Shame on Matt's. They are better than this. I will never be back. The food is overrated and the service is literally worse than what I would expect from a McDonald's.",

Food Ordered : The Skinny (4 egg whites scrambled with gruyere cheese, local organic baby spinach, and chicken apple sausage cooked in olive oil and served with a simple little salad) - the scramble was very good but had a few shortfalls - they were 'skinny' on the egg whites and over compensated with too much gruyere. The simple salad was simply tasty and refreshing.  Waffle (made from scratch Belgian style waffle, sweet cream butter and real maple syrup with two slices of thick-cut bacon) - basic breakfast selection that didn't disappoint.  Overall we were satisfied with the newer location. However, they did not start our experience off on the right foot. There was a 30 minute wait to be seated so we went next door to get a coffee. When our table was ready they told us we could not bring in our coffees but could sit them at the front of the restaurant due to \"health code violations\"  (No such code exists) so word to the wise, if you don't want to waste your $6 Starbucks coffee then I'd skip going there while you wait.",

    "text": "Super cute place to get brunch! We ate at the Camelback location. I saw this place featured in the Phoenix magazine and was excited to try it. It was very busy, we were told a 50 minute wait but only waited 30 so that was nice.  I had the cheese omelette with breakfast potatoes. I added mushrooms - it was excellent and the portions are big. I could've eaten five plates of the breakfast potatoes. My boyfriend got the pancakes and loved them, said they were very filling.   The service is great. Our coffee mugs were never empty. Everyone is your waiter/waitress so you can ask whomever to help you. They were all friendly and efficient.   The only reason Matts doesn't get 5 stars for me is because the seating was so uncomfortable. We sat at a high top and the stools are hard metal squares. Maybe I have a big ass but it was not enough room and definitely not conducive to wearing a dress. Space is also cramped.   If you can avoid the high top seating, I highly recommend Matts!",

Talk about overpriced!  The food is okay. The pancakes are very light and fluffy, but the hash browns were soggy and gross. I don't think the coffee was all that fresh, either.  The customer service is also lacking. I almost got the feeling that my table was being avoided. I sat without water for almost the entirety of my meal while a server walking around with a pitcher visited every other table. I guess I'll be sure to bring my own water bottle if I ever come back!",

Danny got the breakfast sandwich and thoroughly enjoyed it. Even the butter used for the waffle was yummy and I'm very glad we went here. One of Danny's favorite podcasters recommended this place and I am sure glad he did. The place looked urban and clean. Lots of use for wood and metal. I would recommend this place, they came around filled our waters and coffee often. We were also seated right away and got to choose where we wanted to sit. When we were leaving, it did look like there was a wait for forming. So try to come early if you can !",

We decided to go to different location on camelback since it was closer to our resort.  Food was mediocre.  So sad.   Omelette was weirdly slimey.  And everyone's hash browns were cold in the middle. And even their waffle was cardboard.   The bacon was tough as well.  Home fries were ok. Service was so-so.   Not sure why the food wasn't good. I do want to say we have always enjoyed their food.  But won't be back at least to the one we went to.   Sorry Matt's.",

This place is your quintessential get-in/get-out breakfast joint, but with local ingredients in a clean open atmosphere.  We ordered the breakfast sandwich (bacon, marinated onions and american cheese) and salami scramble for breakfast.  The scramble came with a choice of hash browns or home potatoes, so I went with the hash browns.  I must say, I think those were my favorite part of the meal!! The outside of the hash was super crisp, and the inside potatoes were luscious and almost creamy tasting. 10/10 would order again.    Service was also good.  Our waitress was fast, sharp and on point.  She was good about keeping our water and coffee glasses full, and I appreciated the amount of times we were checked on.  All in all, I had a enjoyable quick breakfast, and look forward to going back to see what else they have to offer :)",

I ordered the Chick and the Hog and the bacon was undercooked and my wife's was also undercooked.

The hostess while friendly and smiling couldn't keep straight which customers arrived first to seat them in order. Then our unsmiling waitress took our drinks and order but never came back once to check on us. She even had another waitress bring us the check.

Always busy with a line to get in but great places are like that so if you want to eat quickly go to Dennys so you don't have to wait so long.  Everything is made from scratch and fresh. The Waffles are outstanding as are the Griddlecakes.   I am a really big fan of the Big Butter Burger also. The burger is just plain good and when they bring it to you, you will be happy.  If you can, make sure you get some bacon here which is very good.  Service is good and the new location is spacious compared to the original restaurant.  What is nice is that the small feel still transferred to the current location.  Would recommend going there either early in the morning or later prior to closing to minimize your wait.  Can't wait to go back!",

Unfortunately, we weren't smart enough to order the fresh squeezed orange juice... but if we would have... I'm sure I would recommend that as well. Good job, Matt.",

The staff was friendly which make it a plus.   The food was mediocre and kinda bland. Plus they didn't bring part of our order so it was like cool we don't want it anyway. It seems like the normal complete meal that you get from any other breakfast place you have to add it on here. Then the food took some time to come out. Smh. We were like it doesn't take that long to make breakfast. We were not impressed with this place at all. Sad to say but we won't be going back",

    "text": "Imagine the original Matt's Big Breakfast, only in a slightly smaller setting. The menu is the same, the food is the same, and the service is the same. The only difference?  Now, you actually have a place to park your damned car!  We've been waiting on this Matt's location to open for quite some time to the point where they were so far past their originally projected launch date that I had almost forgotten about it. And then, just on a whim, browsing through Yelp, I noticed that it had quietly opened its doors back in January.    Honestly, there isn't really anything I can say about Matt's that I didn't say in my review of the original location. The breakfast served here is what I consider to be the gold standard. It's traditional breakfast food that thrives on simplicity, without the need to be annoyingly trendy with stupid gimmicks like 500 different types of omelets or offering up liquor at 7am in the morning. Keep it simple, keep it good, and ultimately, you don't need all that other crap to keep customers coming back for more. Now, if you're used to only going to breakfast places that offer a Bible-sized menu of dishes to select from, this might not be the place for you.  In my opinion, you really can't go wrong with anything, including the thick cuts of peppered bacon, butter-infused hash browns, homemade jam, and various honey lemonades and orange juice. The quality of the food at this location is consistent with what we've come to expect.  If you come during busy weekend hours, don't expect the addition of an extra location to have an impact on wait times. It's just one of those things that we've all learned to tolerate. Good food can't always be kept secret, unfortunately.  In some ways, I do see this location as kind of an odd choice. It's not really very far from the other Matt's, so it's not like anyone is pocketing all this extra gas money by going here instead of downtown. But in the end, who really cares? Matt's could open up a location at the bottom of a tar pit and I'd still give them five stars for the food alone.  It's simply the best!",

Ham on the bone- awesome Bacon- good, great if u love lots of pepper Poached eggs- really good Toast- great Pancakes -awesome Scrambled eggs- average Potatoes- awesome Hash browns- not fresh so oily Extra syrup for pancakes 1.50. Really?  Just charge me more upfront for the pancakes and save me the story about syrup direct from Vermont Staff- awesome Dude at front counter- possibly too much coffee this morning, to tight of a blue shirt, or just an ego issue.  He was not equally not polite to customers and staff.  All in all par",

Between hashbrowns and home fries, I'd have to go with the Home fries. They come with some sweet onions mixed in and it's delicious. Hashbrowns are just a lil mushy under the crispy top layer. I'm not a huge fan of toast (it takes up precious pancake space) but the strawberry preserves it comes with makes it a necessity when eating here. Love the interior and the service!",

I usually go to the location on downtown, but usually that location is always super pack and the wait is at least 45 min. Food is always amazing here, however the service was not the best. The original location people are super nice and attentive. My server after getting my Oder disappear until she drop off the check, when I was not even done with my food. In my personal opinion I find it a little disrespectful that the servers are rushing you to get out of the restaurant. I hope the service gets better.",

There was no line and not many people in the restaurant. My touchstone is biscuits and gravy, if you can't make those good, you probably can't make anything good.  I had their biscuits and gravy (Tuesday only). The first thing I noticed was that they were very spicy, I like spicy, the wife does not. I like a lot of sausage in my gravy, they had that. I likes me some good biscuits, these were ok. The thing I did not like was that there was not quite enough gravy to finish the biscuits. The eggs I ordered were exactly how I wanted them, the hash browns were pretty good, crispy on the outside kind of like mashed potatoes on the inside.  The did not have salsa. I like salsa on my hash browns. I tried their bacon since everyone raves about it. I would not call it bacon. Bacon has a smoky flavor, their bacon is peppered and because of that tasted like very tender beef jerky.",

First, they seated us next to where they bring the dirty dishes...really noisy and crowded with servers and dishwashers. They should move this station outside the eating area, for sure. I ordered the cheese omelet with chicken apple sausage. The waitress brought me the hog and chick. Not ever dining here, I thought that it was what I ordered. The omelet was definitely not Big, the potatoes were very salty and the chicken sausage was ok. My wife and I ate our meals and then asked for the check. Wow, it was over $37.00 for an omelet, oatmeal and a $5.95 Five Spot. When I asked the waitress, she said that the cheese was $2.00 extra and the sausage was a $4.95 upcharge. What a ripoff and not Big like the name says at all. The waitress asked me to speak to the manager and at 1st, she reduced the bill by 20 cents...no typo...20 cents and she told me that it was organic and the sausage was locally obtained. Who cares! It was overpriced and not all that tasty. To top off the experience, I have been sick all day since leaving the restaurant and think that I got food poisoning on top of a lousy meal. First and last time to Matt`s Big Breakfast!!",

There was nothing that screams WOW to me. Again, the griddle cakes were just ok. There was nothing extraordinary about them. I feel like eating at a friend's house, not a much raved about breakfast place. The bacon strips were actually delicious!!! I love the peppery taste to it. It's an average place for breakfast, but not one of the best.  I wouldn't go out of my way to get here if you don't live nearby. I would give it 3.5 stars, but I can't with this app. Overall,  it was a very nice experience as far as the staff, but I feel the food could be better for all the 5 star ratings I have read about.",

I was excited to eat there because I had heard how busy the other Phoenix location was.  I have to say that the food was average.  It was so greasy and shiney that I thought Rihanna was going to walk in and start singing \"shines bright like a diamond\".  I hadn't seen such glistening food since living up in the mountains in Montana.  My wife and I had to ask for extra napkins to dab off all the excess oil. I only ate it cause I was starving, but then felt I needed to run home to get my cholesterol pill.  All jokes aside,  it wouldn't be my first choice next time. But I would be willing to try it again in case maybe the cook was a little heavy handed.  One more note to the owners.  The toast was sopping wet in butter too.  I had to tear off the upper layer of bread.  Oil is not the answer for a good breakfast. My wife makes awesome dishes that any restaurant would love and she uses Pam spray.  That's really all you need.  I ordered the 2 egg breakfast with hashbrowns, bacon and toast. + coffe",

Ok the negatives, I've never understood the restaurants with limited beverage menus but this place takes it to a new level.  RC. cola.  Nothing. Else. This might work for the millennials crowd searching for some tough love therapy but how about a coupe of more choices? I get the fresh squeezed OJ and honey lemonade as high margin items for Matts kid's college funds but maybe a clear soda and a diet soda of some kind for the young ones.  The food. Breakfast is the meal I love to take family out to so we do a lot of breakfast places.  This is seriously the best breakfast food I have had in the last year.  Waffle was simple with powdered sugar sprinkled but had this sweet flavor that no doubt came from some kind of ingredient in the recipe.  Incredible.  The cheese omelet with $1 add ingredient  of mushrooms. Wow, simple but another winner.  Older Kids had menu standards of \"hog & chic\" and they raved about it.  I took a bite of the hash browns, not really a hash brown kind of guy but they were unbelievably unique- not crunchy, not greasy, just about right.  The negatives.  Service was pretty sparse. Could be they were overloaded.  They were pleasant and all just not around enough. Sat for long periods with an empty coffee cup trying to make eye contact with someone....bright spot was Lupe.  Attentive to tables that were not even his (ours included) seemed to be looking at the whole place ready to help.  Great part of the crew that lifted the sub par rating of the staff to a passing grade. Funny side note was the manager?host? seating everyone.  Guy was metrosexual hipster caliber right down to the intentional single side front shirt tuck.  I kind of got a kick out of the soup nazi meets Nev Schulman  attitude but the older kids were annoyed....",

They had an edge on them, sharper than the knife I used to cut the sausage patties I ordered. Our waitress gave me anxiety- I literally took my clonazepam at the restaurant. She talked to us super quietly, at about 1,000 mph. The specials? Couldn't tell you because we don't know what the hell she said. So we ate fast, drank our strawberry lemonade  (that was regular lemonade with red dye... I don't know either) and took our check to the front.  The girl at the front had a cute sweater on, but her math skills weren't that cute. We asked her to split the bill but she said \"you need to do your own math.\" Uh okay. So we pull out our calculators and figure it out,  then tell the girl with the cute sweater how to charge us. Good thing we all have iPhones; I don't know what the poor girl would've done if we didn't figure it out. We dodged the hoard of homies blocking the front door and safely made it to the car (granted, we had front row parking)!  We left full, but confused and a little traumatized.",

Showed up and there he was; Big Matt with a big smile in his face; at the door being the hostess of his restaurant.  When do you see than any where else or any other owner with half of his reputation even attempting it.  Just by seeing that site and his humble positive energy I was really ready in trying the service and the food.  I never had an American Breakfast like this before.  Crispy waffles on the outside and gooey and soft in the inside.  Freshly squeezed orange juice and bottomless awesome coffee.  The pork chop was a little dry, but that was about it, everything else was awesome!  Matt does so many things right, stevia on the table, perfect selection of coffee cups made in the USA!, the fresh cut flowers on the table, but the very especial thing, was the staff!!  I think everyone of his staff including the two managers came to check up on us, and ask if they could get something for us!  Spectacular service, restaurants in the Valley should learn from Matt's philosophy!  Everything is honest, fresh, authentic, simple, taught off and  delicate.  Keep growing guys, keep getting better, maybe a Dinner menu with late hours could be a possibility!!  I can Dream right, and Dreams are meant to be lived!  Blessings",

    "text": "So today I decided to take my wife and daughter out for breakfast being Valentine's day. I've been to the downtown location and  never had a problem. We decided to try the biltmore location this time and was very  disappointed in there service. The wait time is usually  a bit long but we knew we were going to wait especially being Valentine's, surprisingly we only waiting 45min to be seated. We have waited longer at other times we gone. But from the time we sat down took like 10min to get someone to help us then the part that got my wife  and me more upset is that we had put our order for the food and it' took 45min to get our food. People that were outside waiting were seated and got there food first than us and we asked this waiter if he could check on our food because we been waiting for awhile. HE  went to the back and never heard from him again finally 10min later we got our food. And we never got our receipt either we usually get it half way through our meal. So we had to walk up to the front and ask for it. Was the worse experience at this food chain the food was great but the service was horendous.",

    "text": "I have been dying to try Matt's Big Breakfast but every time I went to the downtown location it was packed and I had to wait too long,  which increased my curiosity.   I learned of new location of Matt's this morning at 32nd  Street & Camelback and I had to go for it. It was packed on Friday morning at 9:30 and I thought, wow they must have some great food.  I took a look at the menu and was disappointed.  I saw only a few choices and a daily special of scrambled egg surprise.  The waitresses were friendly, the coffee was great but the food was only okay.  The sausage links are nothing I would order again but the bread they used for toast was tasty but it was too wide for my liking at breakfast.  The  preserves were great, but only one selection that day, no strawberry today.  The prices were about the same I find everywhere else around town.  I would have like to see a bigger selection on the menu, like eggs benedict...my curiosity has now been satisfied with my only visit to this restaurant.  Your missing it.",
