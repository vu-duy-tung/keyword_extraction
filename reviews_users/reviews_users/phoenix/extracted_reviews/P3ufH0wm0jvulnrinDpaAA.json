Neither of them were anything more than mediocre. Both had disgusting cheese that tasted and looked like cheese whiz- the chicken on the Nachos was flavorless and there were maybe half dozen chicken cubes in total on the plate.  The portion size for what we paid would have been great if the food was decent, but it wasn't. The place was packed and too loud to be able to have a conversation. The music being played was good but too loud- this isn't a night club... Disappointing overall- but again service was great!!!!",

We had the Caribbean jerk- it was ok, spicy garlic- was a good one, Jammin jalapeno-spicy/tangy., Thai curry- tasted like Ramen noodles, mango habanero-Loved the sweet spicy! It hits you,try it and Sirraacha- Spicy! Remember everyone's taste buds are different so ask for a guest captain and sample some sauces!  They charge $.60ea for celery and ranch,which don't get me wrong is fine but I didn't know. Tuesdays is traditional wings day which are only $.50 Thursday are boneless wings and not sure how much! To end it, place is good, staff is great, food is freaking delicious!",

They really don't know what's going on. The server I had on my second visit was absolutely rude. The third visit was even worse. The servers kept coming out with food asking every table if what they had in their hand was their order. When my order came out it was wrong but I thought maybe it belongs to another table since they kept going around asking whose food they had. I told the server I would eat it since it was wings it wasn't a big deal.   The issue with this place is that they are not staffed or trained for a sports bar. The staff seemed overwhelmed. When you manage a sports bar or work at one its always going to be busy, especially at this location. So get it together BWW. Train your staff properly.",

I have been up here a few times for football Sunday, and a couple UFC fights. It's absolutely awesome here!  There staff are really friendly, and know their product well. I like how they have their names in the back of their shirts, for the simple fact that I can be horrible sometimes with names.   The menus is very impressive! They have tons of different genre of foods to choose from, most importantly they have a decent drink selection as well. Before we go there let's get back to the food menu... The wings are supposed to be pretty delicious here from what I know. They have about 21 different wing sauces to choose from. I really like the Spicy Garlic!   Tuesday nights they advertise \"Wing Tuesday\" where all day they have 60 cent wings. That's pretty cool!  If your looking for a cool, entertaining sports enthused atmosphere you need to stop by and check this place out in the West Gate Plaza!",

The food is okay, I've been to other locations including ones out of state and it has always been better. Hotter, crispier, etc. We have had had multiple incidents at this one, once a waitress knocked over a full glass of ice water all over my husband and on me, and rolled her eyes and muttered under her breath calling us a bad name as she walked away to get us napkins to dry off with. Another time we sat down and our server asked what we would like to drink and I said iced tea and so did my daughter and she came back 10 mins later with one glass and said that they were out on that side of the restaurant so what else did I want ( she made it a point to let me know the other tea container had some but was in the dining area). Tonight was the last straw... now I get it, I've been a server before and did it for a long time. When it's busy, it can get hard to keep up with tables, we came in at 5:40 and there was only 3 tables taken and no wait at all. Awesome! We ordered our drinks and food, received our appetizer. Here comes the food. It was soggy and cold and just gross. Our waitress never came to check on us after we received it, my husband had get up to ask someone else for ranch, another beer, and a box. I got up and got the caps for the ranch. The bathrooms were disgusting and the sink was backed up with paper towels, and 2 of the 3 toilets were not useable( someone else's body matter on the seats). My husband asked for the check from another server since our had disappeared, and low and behold our waitress showed up and threw( and I do mean threw) the check at us. My husband got up and asked someone to please take our bill so we could leave and was told no that the server had to do it. So I got up cause I saw 2 managers talking at a table and asked if one of them could help me out. I let the manager know what was going on and he pretty much blew me off. This will be the last time I ever, ever waste $100 there.",

When there isn't a large wait time it's either short staffed, empty of customers, or both. This restaurant could be better considering the fact that they give some foods cold. Their seating takes long and as well as their food service. The stadium I understand is a great resource for them but they should be prepared on those type of days. They let a lot of people do carry outs of large orders, not like 3 mediums  dishes of wings but like 8 larges. This really slows down the food service inside the restaurant. Their waiters are respectful and some are amazing but for the food to come out of the kitchen warm is awful. Yes they have a variety of delicious sauces but those sauces aren't gonna make up for the long wait from both seating and food delivery they give out cold food. A two is just fine for this restaurant.",

It was never about their services but with their food. Until recently when my boyfriend took me out after work. We got there around 11:30pm knowing they close at 1am and stop serving at 12am. We get in and order right away no need to look at the menu but since we had first walked in the manger was starring us down the entire way to our table. He also started at me as I was waking towards the bathroom. I felt very uncomfortable. As I was walking back I passed him for the second time And heard him apologizing to the waitress about us walking in. As a manger myself I understand how sucky it is to have someone walk in last minute. On the other hand I don't think starting us down was the best option. We may have been  the last ones in but we aren't the last ones out.  Plus, I always clean up the table and stack everything neatly for the waitresses and tip generously.",

Server asked my friend to repeat his order multiple times while sitting at our table. I ordered chili queso and the guys ordered wings. My queso was cold. Not like meh it could be hotter, like this has been sitting on the counter and never got warmed up. I'm not one to send things back but this time I did. And I swear they just brought me the exact same one back 5 minutes later. At that point my boyfriend talked to the manager and I gave up on hot chili queso. Interestingly enough the manager came and took the cold queso away and didn't even offer to get me something else. He did comp the queso though, so I suppose I should be happy? The waiter never came back after dropping of the second try. Not for refills, not to see if round 2 was the right temperature, not even to collect our money. We had to pay with the manager at the hostess stand. NOT cool. Definitely won't be back to this location.",

    "text": "This was my first time trying Buffalo Wild Wings. And, I was pretty impressed, mostly with the staff, due to what time/day we chose to try this venue.   We knew it would be packed right after the game, being next to the stadium & a venue that offers classic sports food w/ beer & a full bar. The line was VERY long to be seated, & the hostess could not \"quote\" a specific wait time- this made some potential customers angry, but I used to work in the hospitality service and totally understand why they don't want to get yelled at for quoting a wait time and a customer may end up hanging out longer to finish watching one of the MANY games on one of their MANY screens.   I have to hand it to ALL of the wait staff & hostess. Absolutely every single one of them were very friendly and very attentive. They checked on all of their tables (even tables that were not their own) quite often. The wait time, even with a long line, was still pretty quick to be in & seated. Drinks came out promptly, and food took less than 30 minutes even with such a huge crowd and busy time of the evening. We were literally in & out in about an hour or so of arriving, so we were pretty impressed with how smoothly they were running the gig.   I don't really want to complain or ding them for a cleanly atmosphere when it is more than understandable that the floors are going to have debris & bathrooms are going to be a bit less than spotless during such a busy time of the evening right at the post-game rush, especially since this venue is right next to the stadium.  The only thing we found a bit frustrating, was the menu. (And, my drink was pretty weak for an alcoholic beverage that was priced pretty steep but was majority tonic water.) We had to actually kind of have our waitress stand there & walk us through the menu because it was not very clear. And she even admitted her frustration with it, because apparently this menu is new and re-vamped. BUT, whomever re-vamped it left out some pretty critical information!   Most go to BWW for the wings. Well, their menu only gives you the option of: small, medium, large for an order. It does not state HOW many wings come with each size. So you have no idea what you are getting for what you are paying... will it be enough or too little? Can you share a certain size with two or more people?? And while they have an AWESOME selection of flavors (that absolutely tops Native Grill & Wings any day!) their menu also does not specify how many different flavors (out of the 20+ to choose from) that you are allows to select per order size. We felt bad that the waitress had to sit there and go over in detail what the menu was missing in information before ordering. So, I really hope they can fix this new menu to include that basic information that would make ordering much more easy!   But as far as the wings go- OUTSTANDING! Hands-down, BWW has wings that are far beyond what Native Grill & Wings could even try to compete with. They are not only priced better, with more flavor & meat on the bones, but those flavors & the quality are just fantastic! We split a large order between the two of us, containing the garlic Parmesan, Caribbean jerk, teriyaki & dry rub chipotle bbq... that was 20 wings worth and plenty for two! And they were perfect! Perfect amount of flavor and the wings were not at all weak- decent amount of meat on those bones. The only thing that was weak was the drinks from the bar. I'm almost questioning if there even was alcohol in my tonic water...   But, hands-down, I will go to BWW over Native ANY day! They really have the best wings and their sauces/dry rubs are outstanding. Well worth the outing & expense. And the attentive staff just made the experience all the better. I give them props at doing a great job during such a busy rush. Not bad at all for a first visit during a chaotic time right after the big game!",

My family and I were patient enough with the food here because we knew how busy it was but when it came to getting our food, the lady who gave us our food didn't even give us boats nor napkins and on top of that she only gave us 2 cups of ranch for a family of 5. We had to wait 10 minutes to get a hold of our waitress as she came by and asked us if we needed anything but she literally took another 10 minutes to bring us what we had asked for. The worst part is during that time she brought the people next to us boats and napkins who were seated half an hour after us. While she was getting our napkins and boats that should've have been brought with the food or even before were delivered to the table next us. The table next to us were seated after us and when they received their food, they brought everything they needed. So why cant all employees bring all the customers necessities. As basic as napkins, utensils, boats, more than 2 cups of ranch for a bigger family and refills. As far as I'm concerned, I wasn't the only customer to feel as their waitress disappears as the table next to us were talking to the manager on how they haven't seen their waitress and needed basic things as refills but had to ask other waiters/waitresses.",

There weren't that many people there to explain why we waited forever for our food, were told at least twice that it was \"coming right up\" but obviously wasn't, had to ask for more water (it's 114 at midnight for heaven's sake - fill the water). I asked for a fork for the grilled tenders (duh), and the waitress dropped two sets of silverware on the corner of the table by my husband without a word or even a glance. That's why you got no tip, and why this place is getting one star, and why we won't be back.",

We waited for an hour to be seated on top of that when we finally got a seat they took our order and got our drinks. Our server didn't even come back to check on us or to see if our drinks needed to be refilled. So my husband got up and went to the fountain to refill the drink himself and that's the only time he was noticed a worker asked him what he was doing and he said refilling my drink. On top of that my husband and I ordered the same thing as two of our family members and our order never came out. I asked our server to check on our order she looked lost like she didn't know what I was talking about. She walked away and it looked like she was just punching in our order so we ended up leaving a nice family gathering. Our other family members were still there and when they went to pay the bill our order showed up on their bill. I feel like the workers here don't have a sense of urgency when they see customers.",

The kitchen is seriously lacking. The first time we went, it took nearly 20 minutes for our appetizer (garlic mushrooms). When we got them they were cold. I asked for them to be remade & they did. We didn't get it until after we were almost done with our meal. The pace of meal is horribly slow, every time. Any time I order a substitution (ranch instead of bleu cheese, etc), it never gets made with it. The only decent thing about this location is the walls are covered with TVs to try to distract yourself from the terrible dining experience that's going on.",

    "text": "The only reason this review is 1-star is because Yelp forces you to give a rating. Had there been an option this would be 0-stars or a negative rating. Bar none the worst restaurant experience I've ever had. When we checked in we were told 10-15 minutes. We were seated an hour later. Roughly 1/3 of the tables were empty at all times. It took another 20 minutes for someone to take our order after we were finally seated then it was nearly 45 minutes past that when our food arrived. The ONLY reason we didn't leave was hungry children. I watched one employee take 9 minutes to clear a small table two people were sitting at. There were green/yellow BWW jerseys everywhere but no one had any sense of urgency or customer service. Once the food arrived it was just ok, barely ok in fact. Some warm, some cold, nothing spectacular. We never got refills. Our waitress never checked on us. If I were the owner or GM of this Westgate location I'd be sure the manager on duty on the night of 9/22/17 would no longer be employed by BWW. Needless to say my business is lost forever.",

We didn't wait long, which was probably the only plus out of the experience. We were walked to our table which only had 3 chairs so I had to wait for a min while they pulled the chair from who knows where. The table was all wet since they had just cleaned it apparently. The first thing the waitress asks is if we were ready to order?(2 mins from being sat down) Her name was Alexis. She brings our 4 drinks out and spills one of them on the table, luckily it didn't get on my friends fiance.  She then walks away with the spilled drink on the table and later cleaned it with two of our napkins. We asked for an appetizer (mozzarella sticks), it arrived approx 30 mins later.  Fast forward to when the main food arrives. The food was cold( this is most likely related to the amount of time it took to get our food) who knows. .. The order was wrong for 3 out 4 people.We had to tell Alexis that we needed a new batch of wings , which she kindly replaced and took them off our bill.. The second round of drinks took 15 or more mins to arrive. We had to remind the waitress multiple times.  My buddy and I ordered the prime rib juicy burger. The prime rib was not prime rib. It looked more as if it were deli sandwich roast beef. . I've been to a diff location in where they actually use prime rib.  I will def never visit this location again. I want to add that the waitress was nice through all this, she just needs better training.",

Our server was pleasant but slow. There is nothing worse than a server who choses not to write your order down because they \"think\" they will remember it. Needless to say, I had to request the same drink more than once because she forgot. After ordering our wings we waited about 20 min before it arrived (need I remind you we were 1 of about 5 customers in the restaurant). The wings were so dry I had to request an extra side of sauce just to fully coat them. Overall, not the best experience. But if you are inclined to visit this particular location perhaps wait until the evening when they actually pay attention to their customers.",

Seated out on the patio, which is pretty nice and comfy. Lot's of televisions and faced the court yard so we were able to hear and see the live band.   But their food and service sucked. I can understand being swamped because of the hockey game and all but its was just ridiculous. We were sat at a 4 top and there was only 2 of us. One of the chairs was in the walkway and another server continued to bump either the table or that one chair. Almost knocked our drinks off once. No apology or anything.   We ordered a few AMF's (which were really good) and two of their appetizer's: nachos were gross, the wings with Parmesan garlic sauce were even nastier. I ate the mozzarella sticks, but can you give them credit for that? Can you really screw up mozzarella sticks. Otherwise not impressed at all.   Our waiter continued to make inappropriate comments to me and my best friend. I don't know if he thought he was flirting or thought he would smooth us over because we were having such a un-pleasurable experience.   I was pretty disappointed with this place, everyone raves about it but I think my wing loving ass will stay with Native New Yorker if I want to grab some wings and appetizers.",

I asked a server in the bar if I could snag a table once they cleaned it, she said sure and proceeded to only grab her check off the table instead of clearing off anything else when she had a cleaning rag in her hand. I stood at the dirty table from 9:50 until 9:56 and that is when I lost my cool. She then took her time to greet three other tables, take their drink and food orders, take an order for another table behind us before coming by to clean off the table. Never greeted herself. She cleared the table and then still took another 10 minutes to come back to get us drinks. We did not get any drinks until 10:22. A table that came in after us had drinks and food before she even took our food order. She was horrible. Never asked if our food was alright, how we were doing, if we needed anything else. She was rude and you could tell she hated her job. I'm a server, there's a difference to being annoyed with a table and then just being plan horrible at your job and providing the worst service you could. Definitely never coming back.",

As for the food, it was absolutely disgusting. I ate about 2-3 wings hoping they would get better with each bite but they only got worse. I couldn't even taste the chicken.

Our waiter was a little flighty and the mild Buffalo traditional wings were dressed a little too saucy but they were still nice and crispy. I loved my teriyaki traditional wings, but hubby complained that they were under-sauced especially after he requested that they add extra sauce. My daughter loved her boneless teriyaki wings. I downed my wings with a glass of Angry Orchard Hard Cider on tap. All of us observed that our server was a little inattentive. While taking our order, his eyes would flit to a big screen. He seemed a little distracted. He arrived with an inaccurate order. He apologized that he hit the wrong button. We had to wait longer for our wings. So, for tonight, service was the reason why we didn't give one of our favorite restaurants a higher rating.",

I waited between 5-10 minutes.. closer to 10.  Nice job Joshua! No Coke products.. ok, not alot you can do about this.. you get a pass for this one. Our server, Sam was pleasant and attentive. Ordered 2 small boneless baskets and a basket of fries.. fries...basket.. half empty and cold. Boneless wings? Breading so think that you have to chip it off to get to the chicken. Also, not too much for the heat. Coming out of a fryer, you'd think they'd be hot.. but, not so much. I remember when Buffalo wild wings was THE place to go for wings.. but now, it just sucks...

Didn't even guide us there party of 6. So we sit at the closest table to them and continue sitting for a good 10minutes not ONE EMPLOYEE came to our table.

It was burnt around the edges and chewy in the middle (not sure it was even real meat). We each took one bite and never touched it again.

All the time I'm thinking \"they don't have a female that knows how to change to the soap refill so they are not closing off the bathroom!  Then it's the matter of cleanliness!  The sink in the bathroom was plugged and it looked like someone had vomited in the sink.  For all the time the employee stood at the door you'd think she would have noticed.  The fans on the patio are so filthy you wonder if the dust build-up is going to fall off on your food.  And lastly the floor in the restaurant is terrible.

As mentioned, planned to have dinner. Neither bartender came within shouting range for me to get their attention. Held the menu up and still no reaction. Actually, at that point, one of the bartenders disappeared.   Sat with a glass that was almost out of beer and STILL couldn't get attention. All of this took place in a 30-minute period. I had enough and cashed out. LITERALLY had to shout twice to get their attention.   In case you're wondering, dinner across the street at Native Grill was delicious with speedy and friendly service. The bat area at Native was packed. Not a single empty chair, table, or booth. This BWW wishes they were that busy.  Second time here and second time it was disappointing.",

We started coming here when we moved to the area a few months ago, and found that they stay open until 2am every night.  We both work late, and it's awesome to have something to look forward to every week.  I had never been to BWW before, but I have become a major fan ever since.  Their wings are crispy and well-sauced.  I found that the honey mustard is my favorite, with the honey BBQ a close second.  Hubby likes to try different ones on occasion, but always seems to go back to the honey BBQ.    We've tried a bunch of their apps, and really enjoy the pretzels or onion rings.  Lately, I've been starting with a side caesar salad.  The lettuce is always cold and crisp, with a nice helping of parmesan cheese and croutons.    We don't always have dessert, but when we have, the cheesecake bites are really good.  We've also found that the staff is incredibly friendly, and love how they greet us with recognizing smiles.  We've actually had waitstaff come to our table just to say hi, even if we're not sitting in their section that night.  We usually make our appearance pretty late...after midnight...so it's usually not busy in the dining room (we don't sit in the bar), and we'll get our choice of table.  We like to pick one where we can both watch the TV's comfortably.",

Everything was ice cold. (We waited over 40 minutes for it, but it was very busy)  The nachos had some lettuce, chili and jalapenos on it. (\"some\" is putting lightly)  The \"boneless\" chicken was so over cooked, there was no edible chicken left. The cheese sticks and onion rings were good.  The positives were that we were able to watch the hockey game with sound. That was the important thing.  Just don't order their food and you'll have a great time.",

I will definitely say the service we received last night was completely unacceptable. We were seated and the waitress got our drinks. We placed our order and everything was fine. However another party came in that was slightly larger than ours and our waitress completely ignored us. Our food took long enough as it was but on top of that our waitress didn't even bring out our food. Another waitress did and I asked for a side of ranch both initially and when the food was brought out. To get a small bit of ranch took almost 15 minutes to receive and that waitress didn't even bring that to us. What's concerning was not the time it took to get our food but the fact that we seemed to be tossed from server to server throughout the night. Our original waitress finally came back...with the bill just handed to us and no apology for her lackluster service. Overall as much as we would love to be patrons of Buffalo Wild Wings we will not be returning to this one.",

We were told that the wait was approximately an hour and we decided to wait. My three buddies and I decided to walk over to the bar to kill time. Wearing our Dodgers gear, we sat at the bar. No one acknowledged us for a good five to ten minutes. After ordering our drinks, the bartenders purposely ignored us. They attended to the other customers and never turned our way. My buddy finally got one of the bartenders attention and ordered a drink. She placed the drink in front of him, turned around and walked away. She never asked the other three of us with empty glasses if we would like a drink. We literally had to flag her down one by one and order our drinks separately. It was obviously and apparent that she did not want to serve us. There was a total of three bartenders and none of them would attend to us. I have to say that this experience completely changed my view of BWW.",

    "text": "So not the best night at BWW.  We are from Irvine, CA and frequent the Irvine location often.  Thought it would be perfect for our large group of 9 people.  It took literally over 15 minutes for someone to say hi.  I asked for a manager and 5 min later someone came.  The server made a bad attempt to blame the host for seating people too quickly but he still could have acknowledged us and said he'd be back in a few min.   The food we got was ok but my mom never even got her food and my dad never got his side.  I had to go to the bartender to get the sauces we ordered (she was great and got them quickly). When we finally told the server to forget my mom's meal and just get our check he never got it.  I went back to the bar and found a manager (in a blue shirt) and he was extremely apologetic and got the main manager.  FINALLY a manager came to our table.  He apologized blaming the busy night for the service.  But.. there were still open tables around us.  I cut him off and said please just get our check.  They redeemed themselves by comping the check but I can tell you that we would have rather paid for our check than have the experience we had.  My mom never got her food so my dad was gonna run her thru Carl's Jr.  on the way home.  Oh forgot to mention, we were celebrating my mom's and daughter's bday.  Needless to say we never even got to order them dessert.",

Wings were cold and damp from the grease cooling off. And on top of all that, they were breaded wings so you know that came out gross. My two order of the original wings came with one small taco shop sized container of bleu cheese minus the cheese... I really like the cheese that's in bleu cheese.  Nacho were okay.  Soda was kind of flat but was the best part of the order. As I type this, my stomach feels kinda sick from the wings.  Yelp app said that my order would be ready in a out an hour. Well, 2 hours later and after a phone call to Yelp, our order was finally delivered. I realize that it might not be the restaurants fault, but it's part of the deal of running a business and I was super disappointed with the service.   My suggestion is to turn around. I doubt this is a complete reflection of Hooters, but I'd suggest finding a different location if you want wings.",

She returned to the table stating that her manager couldn't get that channel to come back up. Now, let me be perfectly clear, this game was on ESPN! I call BS on that staff for not being able to get ONE tv of the several in that establishment on ESPN when they had every other sport, game & channel on!

If you're staff can't handle two tables and run food then you need better staff. Not once did my server come over after someone else dropping off the food to check on us. When he grabbed all the plates that's when he asked if we wanted refills when our cups were clearly empty way before that. I feel bad for everyone who has come here, I've been here once before (horrible still) and decided why not give it a second shot. HA.  The people around us got there food and waited on a chicken sandwich for about 15 minutes which is ridiculous because they were already done with everything else. And then i notice the other table next to me waiting for a server to cash them out and eventually got up to HAND it to them. Not only is every else's food coming out late but ours took about 25-30 minutes (they weren't busy) and it came out COLD. Either this place needs better management or staff, or all together needs to be shut down (this location).",

    "text": "I went in on Thursday at 7 pm with friends. We ordered and it took them 40 minutes to get the staff to say they had placed our food to go. So instead of just saying it and bringing the food to the table the manager said they were making it all over. Service really sucked, we had to ask for refills on drinks and they still had to be flagged down several times. On top of that not even a skim off the price for their screw up. I usually tell co-workers to go there, when we have business meetings I refer out of state peers to go there, no more. It was the worst experience I've had there. It was about 830 about the time we got our food. The upside? It was bike night and people had great rides.",

    "text": "I actually love this place for pre-game chatting and beers. For the last Cards home game of the season, we headed back here because the food ok, the service good and for the tons of TVs and the crowd. We loved that they label the TVs with what game their showing so you know where to sit to get the best view. Sweet!   We arrived probably right about 10:15 a.m. High tops were available so we grabbed a good viewing spot. We quickly ordered and perused the menu. Tons of stuff, but once again we settled on the tablegate platter. So huge the two of us didn't finish it.  We both had bloody Mary's and our server was great about telling us they were spicy. I can handle spicy so I ordered it and it was good. Our server explained that I could order it \"dirty\" but that it added more of a kick, so I declined.  It came with the usual celery and there were pickles added.  New twist, I thought.   Food came out quickly and frankly it's bar food. I'm ok with that. It's game day so whatever. The best part of our THREE HOURS there was the wonderful server we had, Kristy. She was quick, friendly and I felt she took good care of us. When a group of guys asked if we were leaving and if they could steal the two chairs we were not using it's like she swooped in a protected us and said we didn't have to leave because of them. Believe me, we were about to move because someone wanted our seats!  She was very sweet and as corny as is sounds, I felt like we made a friend.    So go to BWW for pre-game fun, loud fans and cold beers. Sit in the open space and track down Kristy. She'll take good, good care of you.",

But whoever is running this store has no idea what they're doing. It took almost 5 minutes just to get sat, in a mostly empty restaurant, while the supposed manager (the only one not wearing an apron) stood at the to go counter chatting with another employee. Once we got sat at our sticky table, I noticed another employee sitting behind the glass separator just...sitting there. I've been here over an hour now, and I've yet to see her move from her spot. My server, was sweet, but overwhelmed, and not one person decided to help her. Watching everyone stand around as this one girl tries to keep up on the 8 tables she had is infuriating. She is the only reason this isnt a 1 star. The management and the rest of the staff should be ashamed of their laziness. Our food was cold and obviously sat in the window for too long. I'm disappointed because things could have been alot better had someone helped her out, instead of watching her drown. Seeing 5 employees standing around in plain view of customers is not a good look.",

The first thing that the waiter told us was \"you should not wear this hat in this restaurant\", we thought he was just joking so we didn't really care too much. But after we finished our lunch and ready for the receipt, the waiter told my wife again that she shouldn't wear that hat in this restaurant. WTF man, my wife bought the hat in Last Chance store which only cost her $3. She was not a fan of any baseball team, and she didn't really know the game as well. We don't know why the waiter had to told us that. That really hurt our feelings... And the service sucks too...the waiter didn't give us any paper towels and paper plate until we asked for them, I know it was a busy day, but he only brought 2 paper towels and 2 plates for us, we had 4 people eating at that time. Fine~ I know he was busy... my wife wanted to refill her ice tea, he said he will bring it, but we just saw him walking back and forth and totally ignoring us. Finally he brought the tea to my wife after we re-attempt to remind him. I wasn't sure all these have to do with the Yankees' hat or not, but I just want to say\" Our family will become Yankees' fans now~\" and one day we will visit again with 4 of us dress up with Yankees' clothes, I'll see you then.",

Normally this restaurant is top notch BUT, one seeing a young man look bother to give a refill of coke, saw the young roll his eyes when he walked away with her empty glass.  My wife even asked me if I saw that.  Piss poor attitude. Now back to our waitress. First tonight was not a busy night, open tables everywhere.  9:30pm No need to mention names but we sat at a high top table against the wall since its was open seating there.  It took the waitress 15 minutes to bring us a menu and take our drink orders.  The waited other 15 minutes for our drinks so I asked for manager, once he arrived I mentioned I would like know if our drinks were ordered.  He walked half way to the bar then turned around and walked to the back.  Never saw him again.  Finally got our drinks after 20 minutes then our waitress took our order then everything seemed ok.  Well I know from being a waiter you need to check up on your tables for refills and etc because you are selling yourself for s higher tip and etc.  well our waitress stopped once to see if all things were good and never again.  Saw here talk with all tables, ok so maybe because we were a married couple but still.  Earn your tip.  Now my wife and I were down and this slow ass waitress was talk with the table behind us for about 20 minutes tops and she saw we were clearly done for the night.  I just wanted my check.  Finally received the check,  well I would never stiff a waiter/waitress regardless of service.  But remember young lady you need to earn your tip with anyone, regardless of the bill size.    I do want management to read this because your staff tonight on April 8th, 2015 lacks all customer service.  Understand you hire cheap labor with young adults but train your people. Regardless your in a busy area like westgate but seeing both managers hanging out in the center on the restaurant observing and then outside when we left just watching your staff.  Why don't you train your staff to interact more or even sell on anything.  That's how you become more profitable.  I won't say I won't go again here but all I can say is this is the worse experience I have had here.    TRAIN YOUR STAFF AND GET RID OF THE PISS POOR ATTITUDE'S FROM THE STAFF.  if they don't like their job tell them McDonald's is hiring.",

We went inside to be seated and saw an additional few empty tables inside with a handful of people waiting. We were informed of a 15 minute wait, which normally I would not have a problem with except there were 6 hosts/servers at the front so they did not look shortstaffed and again, we had seen that at least half the tables outside were empty. When I inquired further asking the hostess to please help me understand how there could be a wait at all with so many empty tables, she said they were seating people as quickly as they could. I asked again, since there were so many employees up there, why it was taking any time at all to seat people at time he empty tables outside. She then replied that they were in the sun. This was not True, at least half of the empty outside tables were shaded and all were near misters. I pointed this out at which point, the hostess looked very irritated and said again that they were seating people as fast as they could. I became frustrated because I have never been told to wait at a restaurant that had so much available seating. Luckily, this BWW location is so close to other restaurants to choose from and we were able to get seated immediately. I will never go to that BWW restaurant again because I don't think that is right. Whatever their reason for not seating people, I just don't think it was good service. We called and told the manager who offered us to come back and be seated right away and have a free appetizer but in my opinion, good service should be provided right away not just because we complained. So we declined. I am not the kind of person to complain just get something free, just wanted to make them aware of how the situation appeared to their customers.",

That was the last time my kids made any noise. They were so glued to the tablets that dining out was stress free! The wait service was great! I'm planning on coming back again real soon!   My only complaint was the initial issues with seating, as well as a sampling of one of the sauces. It did not taste the same when I got my actual order (way spicier!). Aside from that, I plan on returning for another good time!",

I was really surprised that nothing was done to turn our bad experience around..... Nothing... We had a party of 23 ( including kids) so we were willing to accept a little bit of confusion, and wait time, but it was like they never worked in a restaurant before?? Too many options I Westgate to waste my money there again. That corporate GM is collecting his paycheck, and can give 2 shits about your customer service.

When we got there we were seated quickly we asked to be seated outside and our server KAMI, the worst!! She was so inattentive and when she came back with our drinks she tossed my son's straw across the table to him. First of all he's not a dog yew don't toss things at people if she didn't want to reach over she could have simply left it on the edge of the table for him. When she brought us our order she had fries instead of wedges and when she took the fries n came back with the wedges she came back holding the tray in one hand and holding a broom in another so I had to remove my order from her tray. I personally expect for my server to do exactly that SERVE. Then I asked for a side of dry rub which I never received and not once did she come check on is to see if we were doing or needed anything else. And on top of that it seemed as if she was bickering with another red headed server that was there. I complained to Vincent about the situation n he was very nice n apologized n offered us a good credit to come back but we decided to just never go back there again. THE WORST EXPERIENCE BY FAR!!",

Went arrived a little after 6pm before the Coyotes Yarnell Practice Game to grab some quick food before we went in. Quick never happened. Trying to get a drink or let alone a refill was hard work.   Our friends ordered potato wedges for an appetizer, it took them three tries to get it right and then some were cold in the middle. Our entrees took over a half hour to come out and they didn't want to give us any ranch for some reason.  We had to ask our server what the status of our food was, she left and came back 5 minutes later saying they are plating it and the manager was personally bringing it out to us and was going to talk to us. A few minutes later he brought our food and said nothing. No apology. Nothing.   We ate our food, except the person who ordered wings because they were so awful he couldn't eat them.

We waited 20 min for a table on patio when there were multiple tables open. It wasn't even busy. They finally sat us down, but noone came to table to see if we wanted drinks or menus for about 15 minutes. Finally a server asks us if we have been helped.

We only have an hour lunch and came down and expected our food by atleast 30 minutes from ordering, but nope we waited nearly 45 minutes to get our food and when we asked for our orders TO GO she completely rolled her eyes. She didn't specify the menu to us when we had a special order and asked immediately for a supervisor. We asked if we get a discount for working around the area the supervisor said yes! Our waitress comes and says we needed to download the app and from there to get the 10% off but we turned around and said that is not what your manager mentioned. After all the wrap sucks but the wings are okay! After we left she didn't know we had another coworker there having lunch with his buddies and mentioned to us she threw a fit about us and talked shit. Never will we return again. Thanks for wasting our lunch",

Had wings & shrimp appetizer, the wings came pretty much dry. There was little to no sauce on them, they looked like chicken nuggets that were dipped in sauce. The tiny \"jumbo\" shrimp was delivered without cocktail sauce. By the time the sauce came we were done with the wings. The sauce was in a small to plastic dipping sauce container. Such poor presentation. We felt like we were at McDonald's. The only good thing about this experience was the beer, and we never even got our second one. I've always been a fan of BWW, so this was SO disappointing.",

Very huge fan of the Peoria location just sad that the Westgate one is closer I think I will start making the drive. Today was just the worst of them all from the moment we sat down 35 minutes have passed and no one ever acknowledged us until we finally were able to get a waitress attention so that she could turn off the heater. We proceeded to ask her for out server and was responded with \"let me go check\". Another 10 minutes passed and this waiter was attending to the table next to us, once he had finished with his table I got his attention or else we would have just walked by us, I asked if he knew who our waiter was, he responded that it was him and he would be right back. Finally a waitress came and asked us if we have ordered and she proceeded to take our orders. Peoria store will be my spot.",

The next night the bar wasn't even remotely busy, it was super steady and lots of tables were available. My girlfriend and I waited 45 MINUTES for our food. At 30 minutes our server said \"the kitchen is really backed up\" meanwhile, the party next to us who came AFTER us received their food. We didn't even order anytbing huge, just 2 small orders of boneless wings and fries??? We missed our movie because of their horrible service.

Hot wings and beer.......what else do you need.  The thing that sets this location apart is its location. It is located right in the middle of the Westgate area. If you have never been to this part of town, you should go check it out.   If you like hot wings then this is the place for you. Their hot wings sauce is super hot! They do offer samples of their sauces since they have a huge selection, and I would recommend taking advantage of that before you order.  If you are in the mood for a burger then the Big Jack Daddy Burger is hands down the  way to go! Pulled BBQ pork, and onion rings stacked on top of your burger.....GOOD STUFF!!!!   If you are a sports fan, I would for sure recommend you go there to check out a game and hang out with some buddies.",

I also ordered the Pepper Jack Cheese Steak Wrap with chips and salsa.    The sauces on the wings were what I expected.  The Hot wings were the perfect temperature for me, I like my nose to run a bit with a hot flash here and there.  Downside, heavy breading covering the chicken.    My wrap was Ok but for $10+ I would hope for more.    The chips and salsa \"side dish\" was unspectacular.  The salsa lacked any character and chips were plain.   I've had better luck taking it off the shelf at Wal-Mart.    The food was typical chain food and wasn't that great.  The atmosphere was good, plenty of TVs and variety of programming that was necessary as I had to wait 15 minutes for the check and to pay with my debit card.     If I go back again I'll just have wings and will try bone-in next time.  My son reported his cheeseburger slammers tasted like McDonalds. He only ate one out of three. His comment leaving was, \"we don't need to come here again.\"",

I tried to REALLY give this place a chance!! But the 1 star reviews really match MY EXPERIENCE!!  If we were alittle loud, and we may have beenm they failed miserablly in doing their job!!!

We went there tonight, a Sunday night, no game, no activites and we had the worst service imaginable. We sat in the patio and asked three waitresses after 15 minutes who our server was because we had our 3 year old with us. No one knew. When we were getting ready to get up to leave to another restaurant another patron said he would ask his waitress, he did and she served us. It was not her section and she was new, fine, we appreciated that. She didn't know what was on draft but it did not matter since we were hungry and thirsty. After another 15 minutes she brought out the wrong beer order. After another 15 minutes our food came but not our childs. We asked the server and they said we never put it in, whatever. So we ordered again. While we were waiting someone who was a manager type but did not introduce themseleves that way, came and said they would rush the order but never said sorry! The waitress came back and apologized but we said our distress was the fact that our daughter had no food! The waitress left and came back 5 minutes later saying that our daughters food would be comp'd. Not anything else! We were given the wrong beer, waited way to long for service, saw 3 waitresses that would NOT even help us, and the manager type never said sorry! What a joke! As we were leaving the patron that helped get us a waitress told us he was sorry that we encountered that with our family! We left hungry because they never came and asked us if we wanted anything else! This honestly has been the worst service I have been given in the valley and there was no excuse since they were not even busy! I get that staff might be new but with all the other challenges it was a total waste! We should have just left and ate some place else. STAY AWAY! I will never eat at this location again! I will go back to Goodyear or Surprise where their costumer service is INCREDIBLY better, what a let down.",

Basketball and baseball are not the only \"American sports\" anymore (unless you're some hick town) wire your system so that you can accommodate your customers by sections! If a basketball game is playing at the same time that a soccer game is, you should be able to divide your crowd based on their preference. They kept switching the sound from one game to the other and ultimately basketball won. I am holding my table with my last beer of the night with an hour and a half to go until the end of the USA vs Ecuador game. Get with the times! Come on now...",

    "text": "Went to BWW last night, Saturday Oct 18th, for my hubby's birthday dinner. Our daughter picked the spot and hubby gave the okay due to the great food and amazing experience we had at the BWW off north ln prior. Well...our experience here was CRAP compared to their other location. Will NEVER go back here.  We had over a 30 min wait to sit, which was explainable for a Saturday night. Once we finally get sat  it takes about 10 mins to get our sodas, which was \"okay\" since the server did seem busy and took the time to acknowledge that she would be right with us. However the main complaint is once we ordered our food, 2  chicken meals and a burger it took over 45 mins to arrive, granted it was a Saturday it still should NEVER take this long to get food. Once it did arrive hubby's hamburger and fries were COLD, its one thing to wait long for food to come out hot but to come out cold is not okay. Finally the manager comes over and says he understands our frustration and offers to take his UNTOUCHED food off the bill as he takes his plate (um, ya think?) and gives us a 15% discount for the NEXT visit...wow.    Bottom line HORRIBLE customer service here and won't be going back.",

All day there are 7 servers standing at the hostess area just talking. I am looking at the area right now and there are 10 servers standing there talking instead of working. This is a busy location. Get you crap together and get to work.  The manager is nonexistent. I even heard the servers taking negatively about him.",

    "text": "I've been coming to this location because it's the closest one to me, the service and food has always been okay-good, never horrible until recently. The past few months it seems like they hire 15 hosts and hostesses for a shift and 5 waiters/waitresses. Every time I come in, the place could be packed and people waiting for seats, but the host desk is overflowing with employees who just stand around and socialize. The general managers are a joke because they are usually included in this group of socializing people.  Today was the final nail in the coffin though. We ordered takeout because it's football Sunday at the cardinal stadium. I arrived 20 mins after our scheduled time and there was still a 5-10 minute wait (this didn't bother me- I knew they were busy and was understanding). However, the takeout counter was crowded with BWW employees who were all chatting, texting on their phones, or watching tv. I'm not sure if they were on break or waiting for a shift, but the customer take out counter seemed to not be the best place...especially on a busy football Sunday! So I was forced to stand on the other side of the counter, my back to tables and the main path for people to walk through, I was consistently getting bumped into and had to keep scooting over, pressing up to the counter, or apologizing for being in the way. One of the employees left, leaving an empty chair open. The nice woman working the register told me to take a seat and the food should be out shortly. A minute later, the employee that left came back and said \"OH WELL I GUESS I'LL JUST MOVE\" in the rudest tone possible without making eye contact with me. He moved down to the other end of the bar with his friends and I just stared at the woman behind the counter with my jaw dropped. She looked embarrassed and I asked her if I should move and she said \"no\" and walked away quickly. For the next few minutes I had to endure listening to the employee talk crap about ME. It took everything in me not to start a verbal argument with the kid on why I think paying customers should have the option to sit in the seats designated for them considering they are paying for takeout food. Instead I tried to find a manager or someone to talk to, but no one was around, just the hoard of hosts and hostesses. This was the most upsetting experience I've had at a restaurant and I was absolutely appalled by how that employee talked to me, a paying and loyal customer. I'm sorry to say that I will take my business elsewhere and be sure to share this story with many others.",

She blatantly didn't give a f*ck about being friendly or personable, and slammed 2 menus down on the table. Okay, this could've been a one off events but what really set me off is when she did it AGIAN with the silverware. So rude. She also didn't come check on us at all throughout the night and never offered to fill our waters. Her name was bee or bae or Bree or something but avoid her if possible because her service was awful. Not to mention the food literally took like 45 minutes to come out and by that time I wasn't even in the mood to eat there. Would've left no tip but I have some compassion.   The food is always more or less the same at every location, so service really makes a huge difference.",

It had been a few years since I went to a BWW but I remember liking their wings. It wasn't quite how I remembered but the two stars are mainly because of the service. It's the service and the messy tables here that kills me.  We got the Chili Queso Dip, Thai Curry wings, Jamaican Jerk wings, Asian Zing wings, Garlic Parmesan wings, and Salted Caramel BBQ wings (only because they were out of Korean BBQ wings).  Everything was standard and tasted fine.  I especially enjoyed the Thai Curry wings and the Jamaican Jerk.  My least favorite were the Salted Caramel BBQ wings but we had low expectation for those going in anyways.  Our waiter kept trying to get us to sign up for their points club repeatedly and never came around for refills or to give us a box.  Every table in the restaurant was a mess too for the whole duration we were there.  There wasn't a staff size issue as there were at least six people standing around the hostess stand at all times.  All in all, it wasn't the best experience and there are plenty of local businesses I would rather support for my chicken wings cravings.  Sorry, BWW.  It's not me, it's you.",

She apologize, left brought the menus give us about 10 to 15 more minutes to Look over the menu and comes back to take orders for the happy hour. Turns out happy hour didn't start for another hour she apologized and brought us the original menus and give us another 10 minutes to view that money over before we place our order again. She brings out her food in about 20 minutes, our food was already cold, I ordered hot wings that weren't even room temp. Same with the old fries. My boyfriend ordered the chicken strips that were also just warm. We aLso ordered some beers that had to be sent back twice because they sat at the bar too long and became warm.

I reminded the waitress twice that we ordered an appetizer. When she dropped it off (right before our food) she said sorry the person that puts the food together went home so I have to do it myself. Meanwhile, co-workers were sitting around blabbing, eat, anything but working. Plus, a table of oblivious managers sitting right next to us not paying attention to the chaos. This was just the beginning of what turned out to be the 2nd horrible experience I've had at this location. It's a shame... I love BWW and it's close to the house. I would recommend Norterra or Surprise locations. Always consistent service and food.   Teamwork makes the dream work. If the managers don't care about the restaurant or set high standards of excellence and customer service you get a disjointed, unmotivated team delivering horrible service.",

Sedona said let me get something so your table doesn't wobble and leaves to go clean the table behind us. She then goes to the back and comes back with another tables food. Finally she comes back and asks to take our order water still running off the table and nothing to stop the table from wobbling. So I said and I quote *Well are you going to wipe off the table first* her reply was and i quote * you dont have to be so rude* so we got up spoke to the manager and left! So if you would like extremely poor customer service please sit with Sedona!",

I'm not a \"wing\" person but they have some damn good dry rub wings that I just love. They are served in paper boats along with most of the grub which I'm not thrilled with but it's a sports bar not a high end sports bar so it is what it is. But hell even Denny's gives you a freakin' plate people. Ok enough of that bs complaining. Try the dry rub wings & stick to beer because more often than not they're missing items for the cocktails so when you're going here it's wings & beer. That is all for now.",

We got sent to a table to be seated at that had never been cleaned from the last patrons. After that we order some drinks which weren't delivered for almost 20minutes. Not only were they weren't delivered for a while no one checked on us. Then our friend completed the challenge and the only thing he asked for was ranch and they told him they'd have to charge him 60cents per ranch. I get it but then again come on guys. No one thanked us for our business and at that they seemed irritated by us even being there. It was really unwelcoming feeling. All around crap service. There you go, eat there at your own risk.",

    "text": "I hate chain restaurants, especially BWW, but I like this location in particular because if it were a person, the middle name \"Wild\" would be totally earned. It's between a bunch of bars, so you get all the alcoholics who have the munchies, yet will NEVER get drunk enough to actually want \"food\" from McFaddennoJack'sVille, which somehow manages to be even worse. Otherwise, they're here to pregame, and are clearly up to no good from whenever to 2am. Eating here is a total shitshow; the early stages of a series of irresponsible decisions.   And I like it that way.   The awesome staff hushed everyone to congratulate a patron enjoying her 21st birthday. Before any singing can commence, she turned her attention to a stranger with a smug smile across the room, stood up, and yelled out a deafening \"FUCK YOU!\". Half the restaurant erupted in laughter and confusion while she pounded her drink and her friends appeared to hastily ask for a check.   There was smoke billowing in from the patio. I have never seen so many people lighting up at a restaurant like this, many with only drinks in hand. It was being treated more like a dive. Builds character. Meanwhile, I totally tried to convince my friends I was sober before laughing so hard I spilled my beer on the table. It was that kind of night.   My inspiration for this review was meeting a BWW employee from far away, and telling him about this experience. Turns out this particular location has a reputation for being too gosh darn rowdy, and no one except servers hoping for exorbitant tips from the nice drunk people want to put up with it.   So you might think this is a family establishment, but it sure as hell is not, so if you want to pay a visit, leave your snot-nosed sex trophies at home and show up ready to laugh. If you are upset or think I'm a snob for not liking BWW, or just plain unfamiliar with this chain, and sorely disappointed that I'm not reviewing the food, then thanks for reading so far. Everything below this sentence is the boring stuff.   ........................................................................  The reason I am not particularly into BWW is because I feel they take traditional bar food that's really cheap, yet somehow manage to make it simultaneously more expensive than competition while of lower quality. I mean, even Applebee's serves up decent potato skins, but BWW gives you extra-wide french fries with a smidgen of cheese and ground-up bacon. Their boneless wings have way more breading than they should. The coating is really heavy and dry, reminiscent of the cafeteria chicken tenders in middle school. They feel like they've always been under a heat lamp. And they NEVER have enough sauce. It's like they just lightly drizzle it, and I taste it in every other bite. Their hot wings mostly aren't hot, either, you have to go for something unorthodox like mango habanero before you get a sensation, and even then the flavor is undesirable. Tastes real artificial, as though the sauce is composed of mango candy, liquid smoke, with pure capsaicin thrown in because actual habaneros were too expensive. Those burgers look radical though, and someday when I'm dragged here again I'll try one because it's my last glimmer of hope and I could not possibly be more disappointed in their food.",

Bugs stated flying toward our table. We waited for ten min and no one had taken our drink order. When we told one of the waitress she had us move to her section. We finally ordered wings, and fries a water and lemonade. The wing order was for 24 wings and our bill was $45 bucks total! Are you freaking kidding me. The wings were super salty, hard, and the fries were soggy and tasted like crap. Please don't inflict unnecessary pain on your stomach or wallet.

The customer service is scripted, and feels phony. Like the others.   Nothing stands out, unless you like a $20 plate of meh, so so wings and a $6 beer.  They nickel and dime you from there (charge for a little extra sauce, etc.  Not worth the money anymore.

To be fair, if someone in the group suggests we go to BWW,  I'll still go and have a good time, but I've had to modify my expectations to do so.  Knowing what the once were as small, strip mall restaurant with a handful of locations hurts my review after the became a standalone (hey look at us, we're just like Chilis, Friday's and Applebee's now).

The gal working the counter went 10 steps beyond to make us happy. I just called and told the manager what a great job everyone did. I love good service!  The wings were super yummy. I think I will order them \"wet\" next time because the sauce is so good, but other than that, perfection. We will be back!",

    "text": "I'm a server, so I have plenty of sympathy for other servers who are busy. On the other hand, I do have a level of expectations. I came here with a group of ten people this past weekend. It took a very long time to get drinks. Additionally, my friend had to ask for her fries three times, and it was obvious it was completely overlooked and had to be cooked right then. Additionally, I tried to get the server's attention to get us a second drink close to ten times, literally. He needs to actually look at his tables and be attentive to his customers instead of just walking by. We would've bought more stuff if it didn't take so long and if it didn't take five tries to flag him down. It was my friend's birthday, which is why we were there, and she almost walked out and didn't pay because it took so long for our waiter to take payment from her. We were just trying to pay and go. I finally spoke to a manager, who really wasn't all that helpful or apologetic. He finally got the server to run our cards (after the server separated the checks wrong 3 times), and that was it. I was merely told this server was new, which is fine. I am plenty patient, but in his second week he should at least be attentive to his customers, and the manager should certainly do more to rectify the situation. I'm also a manager, so I was surprised at the lack of level of customer service overall.",

When I asked the hostess about the dirty tables I was told there were only 2 servers outside....while I counted 7 for her standing near the hostess stand. She offered to get a manager for me and mentioned something about wanting to make sure we received good service. I thought it was best to go next door to Yard House where they seem to have their act together. Like I stated at the beginning, a typical Buffalo Wild Wings.",

Jasmine and Dante lost the list and were seating other parties who had arrived around 9pm. At 9:45pm Dante asked for my name and said I was not on the list and got stuck at the end. I was furious at this point. I had to at least ask for water since these two individuals are not even trained in service hospitality.  Spoke with Todd. I hope management trains individuals to offer water or soda to people waiting for such a long period of time. So BWW loses a couple of $$ on water/soda but it keeps people from leaving and return customers. Real upset at the incompetence of Dante and Jasmine for losing a list. Even more upset that I am a regular on slow nights and was treated like this, who could NOT seem to try and seat for a party of 2 in under 2 hours, let alone almost 4. Totally unacceptable.",

Jalapeno poppers were delicious but warm beers, a couple poured way short, shots poured halfway put a sour taste in my mouth especially after spending over $80. Another visit was with a party of 6, four of us ordered draught beers, girlfriend ordered a bottled beer and our other friend ordered a mixed drink. Half the drinks show up so we order appetizers and entrees. Entrees show up first, missing my girlfriend's wings, one of our friends' was completely incorrect. I told our waitress (completely inattentive) and she grabs the manager. I work in food as a GM, so I tell him the situation and he looks at me like I'm crazy. Long story short he did not comp my girlfriend's food that never showed up, the drinks we didn't get, and argued with me when I approached him about it before we left.",

All the staff was friendly and the place looks great! Music was kind of loud but I enjoyed it. When my son started to wake up and cry, no one knew because they couldn't hear him over the music!  Really like that you have a touch tunes juke box (I was able to play the music I wanted to hear!), wide selection of beers and the wings were really good (I'm a nny fan, still say nny is the best but still liked these). They have TVs everywhere and would love to go on a Sunday to watch football! Only reason it's not 5 stars is I felt the kitchen was slow to get our wings out. Apps came out quick but wings took a little long. Matthew our server was solid. Seemed new but I think everyone there is. Also, I got blue cheese instead of ranch with my wings. Gross!  For apps, we got cheese curds and fried pickles. Both really good. I ordered traditional hot and spicy garlic. I go here for the spicy garlic, it's amazing! Wife and sister in law shared boneless wings. They had no complaints.  Overall, we had a great experience!",

It was a Friday night & of course it's going to be busy. We specifically told the hostess whatever becomes available (inside/outside on the patio) is fine with us. When we arrived the patio was empty. Then we noticed people just passing by being seated. There were about 5 hostesses just standing behind the desk gigging, laughing and gossiping. Nobody came to let us know how much longer it's going to be. We were basically invisible! We talked to the manager and he apologized we were to be seated right away, by then the patio that was empty was now completely full.. It took 45 minutes to get a seat. And after we got upset, then the hostesses finally started working and letting people know how much time it would take to be seated. The music played inside is way too loud it was like waiting in line to get into a club for 45 mins.",

We only had to wait five minutes to get seated but everything was delayed after that. Our server was great but we ordered the spinach artichoke dip and had to send it back because it was still ice cold. The second one we got was still cold but we just accepted it. We got 4 different kinds of wings and 2 of them were overcooked and extremely hard. Halfway through the meal, the speakers were turned up extremely loud to play ranchero music and although I'm usually a fan it's not what I expect from BWW. There was clearly an issue with the kitchen staff and the management leading to an ultimate breakdown in providing a quality experience. That location will have an endless stream of customers just from the stadium crowds alone but could easily be taken over by someone that knows what they're doing. A server shouldn't have to cover for the lack of effort with the other staff members. We love BWW but we won't be coming back to this location until management changes hands.",

We should have known when it took 15 minutes for the hostess station to seat the 4 of us at a table that was clean and empty from the moment we walked in. We had 3 different servers. Drinks were empty 90% of the time, then when someone did refill them, forgot one persons. Food came over an hour after getting there. We had our food before we flagged someone down for utensils, ranch, and veggies we asked for once. I've been to several BWW, hands down this place is the worst. The waitor wrote down our order, but when it came time for the check, he asked what everyone had. Major problem, whenever you looked around for a server, they were all bunched together like high school clicks or on their cell phones.  Waste of 2 hrs and 75 bucks! Oh and to add insult, we payed cash for our bill. When my \"change\" was brought to us, he elected to keep the 76 cents owed and brought me back just the paper bills, not rounding up. Isn't that like stealing?",

    "text": "Where to begin... this place used to be so great!  We went to BWW at Westgate after the Cardinals Red & White practice. We got there about 6:15 and put our name on the list. There was a lot of empty tables so we figured it couldn't be more than a five minute wait. I asked how long it would be and I was told that there was no way to tell as there was a UFC fight going on and people may not be leaving. OK, but what about the empty tables?!?   We took the kids around the corner to Just Sports and browsed for a few minutes then went back to BWW at 6:30. After standing there in the crowded entry way for ten minutes my 12 year old son noticed a lot of empty tables. He went up to the counter and asked why we couldn't sit at the open booth on the west side of the floor. Then we were immediately seated in that booth. So we got a table at 6:45, 30 minutes after we signed in and with still a lot of open tables.  We ordered drinks and some appetizers because at this point we were all starving.  We were delighted to hear that they could make naked potato skins for my son who has life threatening peanut, dairy and beef allergies. We asked our server to make sure that they didn't use peanut oil to fry and he checked and found out they use BEEF TALLOW to fry their food. Bummer for my son as that now ruled out pretty much everything he could eat. I understand that beef tallow is cheaper than a lot of other oils but it's just surprising to me that a business would use an oils like this when there are other pure oils that could be used. At any rate, my son ended up ordering mandarin oranges and naked chicken tenders.   Fast forward to 7:45... we sat there waiting for our meal, an hour after we got there. Thankfully BWW has these little tablet devices the kids can play games on so we were able to avoid any meltdowns from our 10 and 12 year old. At one point our 12 year old said \"doesn't waiting this long defeat the purpose of going out?\" Ummm yeah.  We finally got our food around 8, after having a chat with the food service manager. I have to point out that the ONLY reason we gave this location two stars is because our server, Tristain, and the food service manager, Melissa were outstanding when it came time to resolve our issues. Shortly after getting our complaint, Melissa had our food on the table. Everything came out fine but it was all such a debacle.  BWW has a great location here. They just need to get a grip on their service. They used to be really good and getting people in and out but if they can't handle the crowd after a Cardinals practice I have no idea how they are going to get through the demand during football season. They have a five star location with one star service right now.",

    "text": "On a busy Friday night, my girlfriend and I decided we needed some wings in our lives, and headed to Buffalo Wild Wings. Most of the tables were taken, so we decided to sit at the bar for a better view of the fights.  My girlfriend ordered two Top Shelf Long Islands for us. I'm always up for a solid Long Island, as long as its quality vodka, hence the request for top shelf liquor. The \"bartender\" began to put the drinks together with Smirnoff vodka. (Mind you, the only reason that we paid any attention is because my girlfriend is a bartender.) When the drinks arrived, because we saw that the drinks hadn't been blessed with top shelf liquor, we inquired why we were charged $7.15 per drink for Top Shelf Long Islands, when the drinks were not Top Shelf. The \"bartender\" responded with \"Well that's how we make our Top Shelf\" and proceeded to go get her manager to fight her battle. I make good money, I'm not beefing about the ticket, but when you say \"top shelf\" as in Patron, Tanqueray, Grey Goose, Bacardi ect., you are not expecting Smirnoff.  The manager came to the bar, did not introduce himself, and brought 2 separate receipts with him: one that had our order, and another that had a 36 dollar price with each shot of each Top Shelf ingredient to make the drink that we requested. The manager was extremely rude in explaining their blatant misrepresentation of a simple drink to essentially fool people into thinking that they are getting a higher quality drink than they are.  Whens the last time YOU had a 36 dollar Long Island?  Never.  We decided that even though Buffalo Wild Wings was stupid packed, after the untruths of our drinks, the cowardly retreat of our so-called \"bartender\", and the lack of managerial addressing of a simple situation, it was not for us on that night, and probably not ever again.",

And it definitely fell short of our expectations, which were already low. Our server was less than knowledgeable and poorly trained, just like the last girl that served us at this particular location. We asked if the chips and salsa were refillable, to which she responded that they were definitely not. When our order arrived, delivered by someone else, we asked if the order only came with the few chips that were on the tray (there was maybe two handfuls). He said 'oh no man you can get a refill when you're done with these ones!' So the order was refillable, unlike what the server had said. The wings that we got had been previously fried and then reheated by being fried again. You couldn't bite through the fried chunk of breading and chicken unless you wanted to break a tooth. On top of all of this, our salsa had lettuce in it (what in the world?!) and our waitress didn't come back for twenty minutes at a time to refill waters or bring the check. It was a crappy experience, as usual. Buffalo Wild Wings has definitely gone downhill.",

We were sitting there for about 15 minutes without being greeted by a server and had no menus. Finally, our server, Jey, came and introduced himself. He told us that he was \"expecting it to be a slow night and it wasn't so if he was inattentive it's because he's helping other tables.\" As a server, you know to never tell your tables this. We had to flag down other servers to refill our drinks and help us with what we needed. Jey was unable to help us as much as needed (& trust me, we're not needy people). My husband and I have been at this location, in the same area, when it's been way more busy and have received phenomenal service. Unfortunately, this time we got a server who tried to make his tables feel sorry for him that he actually has to do his job. My husband and I will be sure to never get this server, Jey, again.

Then in which our \"server\", Allyson, rolled her eyes like she was so inconvenienced to have to take our order came over. She literally brought our drinks and 10 minutes later took our order and we never saw her again. Instead she was gossiping with her fellow workers at the takeout stand. Someone else brought us our food and it was cold. I assume because it sat in the kitchen for a year before someone decided to bring it to us.  Plus, this place is nasty. The servers are so lazy, they would rather kick trash under the counter at the beverage station then bend over and pick it up.   Call me stuck up, but this place doesn't hold a candle to my usual BWW's on Happy Valley. Maybe the Westgate managers should take a class from them on how to run a successful establishment.",

The first 2 came out in @15 minutes, but after 45 minutes (and multiple apologies from the waitress) we finally had to say forget it to the Street Tacos and leave for the game.

However, in my last visit popped in to order take-out as my group was looking after kiddos in the splash park, here in Westgate, and all were asking for food in between their runs to and from the splash area.  When it came time to pay I handed the cashier girl, Maritza, a hundred dollar bill for an order that was over $50.00.  She says she has to get it checked. Routine. Or so I think.   Then, the manager, Joshua, makes his way over with her on his tail, a pompous and overall rude persona.  No explanation as to why the bill is not acceptable.  Crappy and embarrassing situation. Poorly handled. Have we not, in our society, unanimously agreed that paper, these bills, have value?  Never again.",

The waiter just seemed like he couldn't be bothered with us, he never really listened. I asked for water with a lemon he thought I said a bud light. I asked if I could have an Arnie Palmer with their blueberry mint lemonade, that one totally threw him off, he brought me an Arnie Palmer , a blueberry mint lemonade and an empty glass because they just didn't understand what I wanted.

We asked for sauce for the appetizers and after asking 3 times we finally got it. At that point they also delivered the main meal so 2 people were done with their meal and the other 2 hadn't even started their appetizers. We never were asked if we wanted dri k refills. When the other couple went to start their dinner it was wrong and had to be sent back. It came back a second time and was still wrong and had to go back again. On the third attempt they got it right but everyone was so frustrated that they asked to take it to go. A server came up and said to one of our party is shows your day going. He quietly said not too good and the server responded that maybe tomorrow will be better. Not us there anything wrong or anything I can do for you. After spending 100.00 you would expect decent service but it was terrible and they weren't even busy. I contacted the manager to let them know what kind of staff work there. Stay far far away. Don't waste your money.",

The waitress was friendly, but it took about 40 to 45 minutes for our food to arrive and we never even heard a peep from her until it came out.  I would have thought maybe a sorry it's taking so long or something...maybe I'm expecting too much.  Once it did arrive, she instantly asked us if everything looked good.  Being our first time, I wasn't really sure what it was supposed to even look like, so of course I responded with a customary \"yes\".  It wasn't until after she left and I went to put a tomato slice on my burger that I noticed they had left off the restaurants claim to fame, sauce.  Had to wait for her to walk by and ask her and she said she would bring some out which she did.  She never came back by to check on us until we were done and asked for boxes and the check.  Again, she was nice, but just wasn't great at service...maybe poor management?  We were disappointed as well with the lack of enforcement on the no smoking policy on the patio.  The signs clearly say no smoking, but that didn't stop two customers from lighting up right next to us.  We moved inside and pointed it out, but they did nothing about it.  We watched them smoke once more about 30 minutes later as well.  Pretty cold inside too but it's hard to count that against them as I always seem to be cold anyway.  We actually would return because we thought the food was good (the wings were fantastic), we just will be better prepared for bad service, won't sit on the patio (or will confirm the smoking policy ahead of time), and will bring a sweatshirt.",

    "text": "I read a lot of the reviews here usually when I'm bored and as a Waiter and frequent costumer of most restaurants in this valley, I get both sides. Olivia and Christopher who I've known a few years back as a teenager, they are literally the best servers you can ask for. They stay on top of everything, if they can't greet you within a 60 second period they'll let you know so you don't just sit their like... \"Is anybody gonna come say hello?\", plus they're fun to talk to. I like the different wing flavors. Their are 16, such as Mild, medium, sweet BBQ, honey BBQ, carribean jerk, Parmesan garlic, Asian Zing, honey mustard, thai curry, spicy garlic, hot, jammin jalapeno, BBQ hot, wild, mango habenero, blazin lol Any problems, manager Melissa is always ready to fix things, and so is the general manager. The newer staff could be a bit more considerate and nicer to the guest. I know the restaurant industry can be a bit annoying but you have to be nice, costumers are the ones who pay and tip servers and bartenders, trust me, I had a table that literally did everything to annoy and inconvenience me but that $200 tip was worth the smiles and \"you got it\" attitude so I do think the attitudes should be changed a bit, but other than that I love it. They also have a better selection of drinks than where I work at which is literally 10 feet away.... (Yeah)  oh and if you order French fries, please get them with cheese (I like american and queso) and bacon, and sour cream on the side (yes that's extra, not free add ons) ... And please bring the buffalo chicken flatbread back. I really do miss it!!!",

Personally I don't see the hype about BBW, even still I let my friend talk me into going. It took almost an hour for us to be seated, which sort of made sense, as there was a UFC on that night. However once we were seated the real fun began. The waiter was really personable at first, super friendly. There were 4 of us total. I order wings and mozzarella sticks, another friend ordered nachos, the third wings and fries and lastly just another order of wings. I also mentioned that we would need ranch and forks. Took 30 minutes to get our food. An additional 15 minutes for the forks and finally 45 minutes after receiving our food, a friend complained to the manager (after multiple attempts of asking two separate waiters) we received our ranch. In between that the original waiter asked if I wanted water, I said yes. Needless to say I never received it. The mozzarella sticks and the fight were the only good aspects of the evening. Wings were way too breaded. Overall, highly doubt I will ever return.",

I have been twice and neither times have been enjoyable and I have left angry both times. I will NEVER return ever again. The last time was a poor experience due to the long wait time for food. Tonight's experience was absolutely horrendous though. I arrived at 6:20 because the happy hour ends at 7:00 (3-4$ apps and drinks). I immediately put my name down and began waiting. At 6:50 I asked if my party of three would be seated before 7:00, as we had come for the happy hour. They said they were unsure. I asked if we could order off of the happy hour menu while waiting and they said no. At this point I had checked twice with the wait staff to find out how much longer the wait would be. Each time they said they weren't sure. At 6:55 I went to the bar to order a drink and the bartender refused to honor the happy hour price for drinks, even though it was not yet 7:00. She also poured the wrong beer for my friend, and forced my one friend to pay for all three drinks even though we wanted separate checks. Eventually, we were sat, at 7:20. A waiter approached us apologizing, saying that one of the new wait staff thought we had already been seated, which is why we had to wait an hour while a multitude of other groups sat. He also exclaimed that had we been seated properly, we would have been seated before the end of the 7:00 happy hour. I told our waiter this and so he brought the manager out to see if he would still honor the happy hour prices as it was the staffs fault that we weren't seated prior to 7:00. The manager claimed that there was nothing he could do, and did not apologize for his staffs error. I was left fuming. I have worked in multiple restaurants, and whenever there has been an error on the restaurants part, we have always provided a discount, or a free item. This Buffalo Wild Wings offered no apology, no discount, and no offer of any kind to apologize for their error. I specifically had come for the happy hour 40 min. in advance, and left two and a half hours later absolutely livid. I will never return, and would not advise anyone to ever set foot in a restaurant with such poor customer service. My entire evening has been ruined, as has my entire parties. I can not say enough how upset I am.",

I went in trying to order to-go and as I walk in to the take out area this lady greets me and  tells me I have to order from the bar. Shortly after I walk over to the bar and the employee working behind the bar then ask how may she help me and I had told her \"they sent me over here to order for take out.\" Her response was \"there's no one at take out?\" Then, she walks away attempting to help me goes over to the cash register where a few other employees had been standing then talks to one of them then walks back behind the bar and doesn't say a word to me at all. After standing there patiently I got impatient and walked back up to the front. I stood there for a good 5 mins waiting to be helped the hostess and other employees are looking at me not even attending to me and my family members until finally after 10 mins goes by another hostess/server finally asked if I needed any help. I told her how I was just trying to order for take out she sends me back to the take out area. No ones there. Afterwards I kindly saw a gentleman whom I thought was finally going to help me then tells me that I have to go to the bar at this point I was getting really irritated o was still not being helped. I walk back over to the front desk stand there for another good 5 more mins until someone tells me to just go to \"take out\" where had originally went to try and order in the first place. They basically kept sending me back and forth for a good 30 mins after that I just walked out. It makes me wonder if I was to be seated would have I been help than? They really need to up their customer service or get new employees who actually care to be there.",

By the time we finished it was 745, what a complete waste of time. There went the rest of our evening. Not once did he check on us nor tell us why the wait was so long. It was like he forgot about us. I have a feeling he did because when we got our food, it was cold. Carlos is a big detriment to your establishment.

    "text": "I ordered a very simple to go order with 16 wings and fries.  I got home to find there were 10 wings in the box.  I called and the manager could have cared less!  He said he would 'look into it' and made no effort to remedy the situation.  It took over 30 minutes just to get the order, and it was wrong.   This restaurant excels in poor customer service!",

    "text": "Service was horrible. We sat at a table in the bar area. No one came to our table for 5 minutes. We had to raise our hand to get service. Tera didn't introduce herself. We had to ask her for her name. We had to wait over 20 minutes for our food (Naked chicked and lepper pepper wings). When we finally got our food, the fries were luke warm and the wings were over cooked. The manager Todd came over and asked what was wrong. The only he did was bring us fresh fries and asked how the wings were. He never apologized nor did give us any dicount for our inconvenience. Never coming here again! Place was very noisey and cold. Very dirty in dining area and restrooms.  0 stars but i have to post 1.",

    "text": "I was so excited when they opened a b dubs in the area and wow was I let down. The wings are good of course, but the service as never been good and we have tried coming back several times hoping it would improve. This last time was the worst we went for happy hour and 20mins past happy hour time was told we would still be charged full price because the computer wasnt showing happy hour yet. Okay I get that things happen, but then we received our order and no bowls no napkins I had to flag another server down. I didn't receive a single refill on my water and even asked my server. I just cant believe that in such a busy area you wouldn't be able to find a few good servers.",
