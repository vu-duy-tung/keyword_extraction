The only thing that's less than perfect is that some of their menu choices are only vegetarian (instead of vegan), and I don't think they were labeled as such on the menu?  That's important as many believe that dairy products are evil.  Raping cows, to make them pregnant, to then steal their babies (for veal), and then to steal their milk for us, is a gross moral perversion.  So being vegan is important and mixing the menu options with non-vegan items should be corrected soon.  Worth a visit!",

We understood that the service would be slow because of the group - the owners gave us free edamame for the wait, which was nice.  Its great to see a vegan/vegetarian restaurant packed!  The food was really good - I liked that most of the entrees did not feature fake meats, but used mushrooms in place of the meat.  We ordered the miso soup - one is enough to share, the fried wontons, tom yam fish and the tom yam fried rice - all very good.  One area of confusion - we asked what was not vegan on the menu and was told the burger and one of the soups.  We had the fried wontons, then read a review on here that said they were not vegan.   I will be back to this restaurant, there are so many options I would like to try, but may avoid the wontons until I know for sure.",

They redid the floors in bamboo tiles, added nice light fixtures, painted, and added comfy booths.  The atmosphere is very cozy and comforting.  The staff greeted me immediately and were knowledgeable about their menu.  I ordered the potstickers which were pan-fried, so delicious, and came with a tasty dipping sauce.  I also ordered the General Tso's chicken which is made with mushroom and had bell pepper and broccoli smothered in sauce.  Everything was excellent and I highly recommend it!",

I had been to so many other Asian vegetarian restaurants in CA in the past. There are some great restaurants with a huge variety of vegan and vegetarian food. And this place definitely can compete with those restaurants in LA when it comes to the taste and quality. It is a sort of small restaurant, but if you have never tried Asian style vegetarian food. You MUST try their food here at least once and you will be the judge. I am just so pleased with the fact that they are so close to where I live. I do not need to go all the way to Chandler or Mesa to get some ok Asian food (especially vegetarian food). Thank you!",

They have a great menu with many options, mostly Chinese restaurant classics.    I had the Sesame \"Chicken\" which was actually mushrooms that were battered, fried, and covered in a delicious sauce.  My sweetie had the rainbow salad and chose the plum dressing, light and sweet. Jicama!!! I do wish they had gluten free options (lots of soy sauce here), they said they were looking into it.  The place looks great inside, very clean, big booths, new floor, tinted windows.  The staff is awesome, everyone friendly.  They are a family business.  They played some newer American pop music on the radio.  While not my taste in tunes, it did seem to fit the mood of the place nicely and I wasn't bothered by it.  All in all I'm glad they're here, and I'll be back to try every single item on the menu.",

I would expect it to be more pricey considering it's a vegan/ healthy food restaurant.  I don't remember how real shrimp taste ( have a shellfish allergy) but being able to eat \"shrimps\" it was amazing, texture is perfect. I would definitely go back ,I liked it more than regular Chinese food. And now we have place on my side of town to go for food with my daughter, who is fully vegan.",

I've only had vegan food once, and it was kind of disastrous [if you play Cards Against Humanity, its the epitomy of #DisappointingSalad]. So I came into Veggie Village with a bit of timidity. Tigra calmed that down telling me how awesome this place is... and she was right!  Totally non-discrep great find in north Phoenix that I probably would've passed a million times if I lived in the area. When I dined they were just a few days past expansion [holy moly was their original spot TINY!]. The menu is just long and expansive with lots of options... some of which weren't [yet] on the menu. The manager let us/Tigra [mostly hah!] test a few new items out and asked for our thoughts on the combos.   I enjoyed sharing some bites around with my fellow dining companions, come to find out I really like sesame mushrooms [\"chicken\"] and their version of shrimp with my Pad Thai! I'm kind of timid with spice so luckily for me the Pad Thai wasn't crazy spicy. The sauce was a little salty for me, but really flavorful otherwise. Their Salt Fish was crazy good too - something that really surprised me!",

    "text": "For starters, a big thanks to Tigra C for putting on a great UYE at this CenPho spot.  Talk about an unexpected find.  About a block east of 12th Street & Northern on the south side of the street you'll see a lengthy old strip center.  I grew up less than 10 minutes drive from this area and must've passed this strip center thousands of times in my life and never once stopped at any of the businesses.  That was of course until about a year ago when I had dinner at Thirteenorth Grille just a few doors down from tonight's big find.  Much like Thirteenorth, Veggie Village doesn't seem like much from the outside.  I've eaten at other vegeterian and vegan spots in town but almost all were stand alone structures that grabbed your attention even before you walked in.  Here however, its whats on the inside that counts.  We arrived not too many days removed from Veggie Village's big expansion.  I say big in jest as the original restaurant only seats maybe 20.  But the newly expanded seating area brings the capacity closer to about 60 now.  Here you order at the front register and grab a seat wherever.  They do take reservations for big groups and were kind enough to reserve a table for us in the newly expanded portion of the restaurant.  The interior is quite nice and was exceptionally clean when we arrived.  Options for chair and booth seating are available throughout and the wood trim on the table and floors is quite beautiful.  After perusing the menu for a few minutes, I noticed they don't have any dessert options.  A little strange as almost every place I've dined at (even vegetarian ones) has dessert options.  No matter.  I made up the difference by having my own app and an entree.  For the app I went with the cream cheese wantons.  I've had the real crab version of these at Asian restaurants my whole life and I can't get enough of them.  And I can happily say the fake crab meat version was equally addictive.  Cream cheese, celery, and mayo with the imitation crab meat with red dipping sauce.  Just like the real thing.  Put simply, I Hoover'd these things (sorry if I weirded out anyone at the table).  For the main course I was craving noodles so I went with the  classic Pad Thai.  Tofu, ground peanut, lettuce, peppers, lime, faux shrimp, bean sprout and faux fish sauce.  The portion was impressive as I was totally full when all was said and done.  It's not the best Pad Thai I've ever had as I've had more flavorful versions elsewhere.  But this one can certainly hold its own.  Total cost for the Wanton app, Pad Thai entree, water and tax came to about $15.  From a value standpoint, the prices here really can't be beat.  Most could come here and be totally full and happy with just $10 or less.  As our Yelp group tonight were True foodies, our whole group pretty much went nuts with almost everyone ordering and sharing several dishes.  I sampled some of the other dishes including the Spiced Salt Fish and Orange Chicken and they were both excellent.  And the staff here was phenomenal as they conversed with us about their recipes and their business frequently during our meal.  Next time I'm here I'll probably opt for one of the chicken or curry menu items.  And again, no meat anywhere on this menu.  So fear not fellow carnivores and take it from me.  The meatless menu at Veggie Village is legit.",

The Hot and Sour soup is thick and loaded with veggies and v-meat and is filling so it's more of a meal than a side. The Vegetable Curry, Kung Pao Chicken, and Kung Fu Noodle are all good, but they are heavy. The Kung Fu Noodle was so greasy I dumped it in a metal strainer and rinsed it with hot water - it was still good. Their v-meat is a lot like what Loving Hut uses and is a little too close to the real thing for some people so if you don't like shrimp, don't get their v-shrimp. There are a ton of options so as we eat our way through their menu I will update my review.  I appreciate that they confirm (they actually ask) if your order is vegan versus vegetarian. Almost everything can be made vegan, but they do use dairy in some things and need to substitute nut milk.",

For appetizers we enjoyed spring rolls and pot stickers. Everything here is vegan, everything is delicious, there's no worries about what you're eating. Veggie Village is a wonderful place to have a well prepared, well presented, and well served meal at a very reasonable price.

It's a walk up counter, but the decor is hip and the restaurant is meticulously clean. I had the veggie curry with white rice and it was delicious. I ordered mine to-go and it was ready for me to take it in less than 7 minutes. The woman taking my order was helpful and friendly, and gave recommendations without pressuring me to order more. The pictures of the food and the presentation is beautiful! I will definitely be returning here.",

We had the lettuce wraps the first time we went and really liked them but also wanted to try some new things. When we ordered we made sure to say vegan multiple times because they have a vegetarian and vegan option for every menu item so If you are vegan be cautious of that when ordering. I took a bite of the wontons and was skeptical, but I haven't had cream cheese in almost 6 years so I was unsure of what I was tasting. I told my boyfriend to try them and he could tell something was weird. He went up to the counter and asked them again to make sure the won tons were vegan and the two women said yes. A few moments later the cook was at our table telling us they're vegetarian not vegan. She asked if we wanted her to make us the vegan won tons but we were both done eating at that point. All of the employees apologized multiple times and took care of our bill which was really nice but unfortunately we both feel sick and bummed, to say the least. It's really unfortunate that they didn't take us seriously when we specifically ordered vegan everything. The cook told us that our server didn't specify that on our order. It's safe to say we won't be returning to Veggie Village.",

I encouraged them to clarify that as I think folks would find this place even more desirable if they could bring their own alcohol.  The place is small, but, as mentioned before, very clean, comfortable, casual and inviting.  it is run by a family from Malayasia.

I scoped out their menu before I came to familiarize myself and to make my decision easier.  I arrived early and got water as I waited for my friends. When got settled and were ready to order, we went to the front and did that. I ordered the hot and sour soup and Kung pao chicken with white rice. The soup was delicious and came out in a big bowl. I was excited for it because the soup I used to order from other restaurants had chicken in it and this was the veggie version. Loved the tofu and broth, I finished it at the restaurant so I wouldn't have to take it home. Also because it was good.  My entree was really good, similar to the real dish I've had in the past. The flavors worked well together and the faux chicken was spot on. It wasn't very spicy so I'll say that could be improved, but I also didn't eat the chili peppers (too dry). My friend ordered the salted fish which I've seen rave reviews about, and it tasted just like fish. My friend enjoyed it.   I'd love to come back and try some other menu items! Affordable and delicious.",

    "text": "Ya know, sometimes you look at a place with all 5-star reviews and kinda just roll your eyes, like, really? They can't be perfect. There is no way that they're THAT good. Well, honey child, let me tell you something... They were PERFECTO!   We arrived at exactly 11am on a Friday and they were open and ready to serve.  The place is small (not too small), charming, and very warm (the aura, not the room temperature). I'm a booth girl (love me a booth) and I totally love their cute little booth spaces. We ordered at the counter and the employee brought our drinks and meals to the table.  I ordered the Spiced Salt Fish and the Tom Yam Fish (minus cucumbers). Both dishes came with your choice of white or brown rice.   The Tom Yam dish was very tasty. It's a saucy dish, with a nice little spicy kick to it.   That SPICED SALT FISH though!  My, my, my, mymymymy... I'm one of those people who typically add salt, pepper, sauces, etc to my dishes to give them more flavor. Not this dish. It was absolutely flawless just the way it came. (I almost asked my dish if it woke up like this!) The vegan fish was so perfectly fried in a light, yet very crispy batter, and seasoned beyond perfection. The jalapenos and garnishes were equally savory, creating an essential winning combination. I was blown away by the excellence. (Keep in mind, I LOVE salty foods. If you have high-blood pressure or any issues with salt, this is not the dish for you.) It's a dry dish, so I didn't really need the accompanying rice, but I ate it simply to prolong the joyful experience.   My cousin also got the Spiced Salt Fish dish (which was great because I wasn't sharing), and in addition, she tried the Eggplant dish, which came with tofu.  She liked both, but agreed that the Spiced Salt Fish was the shining star.  The employees were very nice and attentive.  My water cup remained full and she brought us to go boxes when she saw us, in all of our gluttony, getting lethargic.  The employees that day got an extra gold star for patience. There was a patron sitting behind us who was very...challenging. He refused to order at the counter like everyone else and his God-like complex was truly baffling. So KUDOS to them for remaining professional, calm, and genuinely nice throughout his charade.   Excellent food. Good portions for a fair price. I am slightly concerned that their location won't yield the business that it deserves, but hopefully, word of mouth will not only keep them afloat, but allow them to expand even.  Be sure to specify if you are vegan as they are not 100% vegan; however, non-vegan items are 100% vegetarian.",

    "text": "I love this little restaurant! The interior is very clean and nicely laid out with comfortable booths as well as regular tables. The decor is simple but very much emphasizes the vegetarian and Asian theme of the establishment. The menu lists a variety of popular favorites one would find in a typical Asian restaurant (sweet-and sour dishes, pad thai and other noodles, etc.) but there is no meat in any of the dishes.   I tried their spicy salted v (for \"vegetarian\") fish; each piece had a very pleasantly crunchy exterior and the vegetarian \"fish\" within had the flavor of a mild, tender white fish - perhaps not the exact texture of actual fish but it was very tasty nonetheless. To go with that, I ordered a bowl of miso soup, which turned out to be a much bigger bowl than I had expected; I'm used to getting a tiny bowl when I order that soup in other places. The soup was good: just the right degree of saltiness and miso flavor, with decent portions of tofu, seaweed, and mushroom.   On another occasion I ordered Vietnamese rolls and General Tso Chicken. The rolls were excellent: a refreshing mix of purple basil, lettuce, vegetarian ham, and roasted rice wrapped in the requisite rice paper wrapper and served with a rich, dense peanut sauce. The \"chicken\" in the General Tso dish was actually whole mushrooms dipped in batter, deep-fried, and coated with a sauce that had a good balance of sweet and sour - really flavorful; blanched broccoli came with the \"chicken\" pieces.   Very pleasant casual atmosphere, phenomenal food at good prices (the dishes are inexpensive - they cost pretty much the same as their counterparts in a regular Chinese restaurant), and great service all make this place a must-try destination. You'll be hooked ... I am, even though I'm not a vegetarian!",

I think they should get someone a little more friendly and upbeat working with the public instead. And pleaseeee put some music on in the dining room!

I am tired of wasting my money on NON-Vegan/Vegetarian friendly restaurants that don't understand the movement/cause of what it means to eat healthy and cruelty free but I digress.   Veggie Village's food was amazing!!. I brought my carnivore friend and he said he was definitely coming back.   The food: Appetizer was the Hakka Tofu which came out differently (visually) than I had seen from other reviews but was still amazing. Fried tofu with house sauce and slices of carrot and cucumber was good and tasted very fresh.   I ordered the KUNG PAO CHICKEN (v) with the mock chicken, I believe you can also do breaded mushroom as an alternative. White or Brown rice was included but I opted for the upgrade to fried rice for an extra $1.50.  It looked great visually and came out super hot. The taste was fresh and snap peas were not soggy or overcooked. The portion was enough for me (200lbs and can eat a bunch) big rectangle plate with rice served in an one cup portion bowl.  The fried rice was also good and also hot. They don't use egg and fried rice was not overly salty or oily.   My meat eating friend ordered the aGeneral Tso Chicken which was really breaded mushrooms. I tried a couple and they were also great. Breading was crunchy and just right, sauces were not overly salted and balanced. He also got the fried rice.   After we enjoyed and devoured our meals and finished the appetizer we sat back and did not feel heavy like other Asian style food restaurants.   Definitely recommended for others looking for a healthy cruelty free place.   Pics below",

    "text": "So I decided to try this place based on the four to five star reviews & I was excited that I was able to stumble upon a place that caters to vegetarians & Vegans which is a plus. Now about what I ordered...  Tonight I ordered the orange chicken & burger to go. When I try a new place, I always order two dishes just in case one is not so great. The total meal cost a little over $14.00  The orange chicken was pretty bland and unfortunately soggy; which was sad because I only had a 9 minute drive back to my destination. Plus there was not much of the orange sauce on the chicken or in the container which would have been nice to mix with the white rice .  The burger was pretty tasty, it comes with fries. I didn't feel a need to add any additional toppings to it when I arrived home. I would definitely order this again.  The final verdict: the orange chicken was a bust, but the burger saved the night!! Four stars overall.  There are other options that look good, so I will give this place another chance to see if I'll stick with my current rating. Maybe next time I'll dine in to see if my experience is different..",

    "text": "I was in the mood for something healthy when I landed in Phoenix and rented a car just to show how serious my quest was, as I didn't want to default automatically to the hotel restaurant and find an inadvertent wad of French fries in my mouth. Yeah, like those fries would have gotten in my mouth without my full consent. I just happened upon this sparsely decorated eatery on the Yelp app and noticed a lot of approving reviews from what looked like the skinnier Yelpers in the Valley. I don't know Phoenix at all but found myself in what they call the North-Central area of town and there it was in a quiet strip mall.  Steamed chicken aficionado that I am, the funny thing was that I had been wanting Hainan chicken which would have put my vegetarian aspirations on the back burner. I have a thing for steamed poultry I can't quite explain except I must be part Singaporean or channeling someone's grandmother up the Yangtze River. As fate would have it, this place was serving as its daily special the $9.95 Mock Hainan Chicken Rice. Such joyous rapture I felt for the prospect of such a culinary creation that I didn't hesitate to order it. It was surprisingly satisfying with the faux-poultry pinch-hitting quite nicely with the cucumber slices, dipping sauces, and infused rice (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2vcE75g&s=1833ae185a930c5131a3358e3d6ca53141a8017af96d31f312a0081b05e5f841\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2vcE75g</a>).  I also tried the delicious $5.95 Lettuce Wraps, which mixed together sauteed and finely chopped vegan 'meat', mushrooms, water chestnuts, shredded carrot, cilantro leaves, and fried rice noodles into an appetizing filling for the generously sized iceberg lettuce leaves (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2vcUwXJ&s=3b0e53d0df8ee5d120646c53190dbabce1998ac5b28488b034a2acb3e334c61f\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2vcUwXJ</a>). In this case, it was truly indistinguishable from its carnivorous counterpart. Other dishes looked quite tempting as they passed by my table like the Hawaiian Fried Rice and the Rainbow Salad. Given what a modest operation it appears to be, I have to say this was a great veggie find in Phoenix and well worth finding on your GPS.  FOOD - 5 stars...great execution of vegan dishes you would not suspect would be so tasty AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...clean and modest-looking in its decor SERVICE - 4 stars...very friendly and helpful in explaining the genesis of their dishes TOTAL - 5 stars...nice to find a healthy dining experience as good as this that won't empty your wallet",

I had the pad Thai with faux shrimp and tofu ($8.95) big enough to share.. flavors were very good.   My bf had the village fried rice ($7.95) it was good, kind of a smoky dish. And the General Tso was fried mushroom, bell peppers and broccoli with brown rice on the side.. the fried mushroom is amazing ($8.95)!! You don't miss the meat in this dish.. if you love mushroom you'll love this ..   We will definitely be back to try some of the other options. Prices are very reasonable for fresh quality food.",

    "text": "Veggie Village reminds me of some of the traditional Chinese vegetarian restaurants I've been to in Hong Kong. They use interesting mock meats and seafood - some that are almost too close to real (to the point that there have been online debates on if the mutton is really vegan - hashtag \"dramamutton\"). They also use a lot of mushrooms, but no onion or garlic. It's probably not the first vegan/vegetarian restaurant I'd take people to in town if they wanted to try vegan food. I've overheard too many diners being confused about what they were eating. But for those initiated into the world of mock meats, it's a real treat! The restaurant is 100% vegetarian, and everything can be made vegan. Just make sure you say which way you want it when you order. There are a wide variety of starters like you would find at any Asian restaurant. Our favorites are the lettuce wraps and dumplings. The miso soup is also very good. For entrees, we've enjoyed the Kung Pao, General Tso and Sesame \"Chicken.\" You can get any of the \"chicken\" dishes with mock chicken or fried mushroom. We also liked the Village Tofu. My only recommendation on the food is that they add more vegetable-focused dishes. And less mushroom (I hate mushrooms, so it limits what I can order here). The service is always friendly, but can get a little slow if they're busy. There's usually only one or two people serving.",

Like seriously, just bait someone into saying veg food is stupid, then show them my photo. They'll feel stupid because this is amazing.   Some dishes here try to vaguely imitate meat. My sesame \"chicken\" was surprisingly made with lightly fried mushrooms as opposed to some soy substitute. I also sampled some grilled tofu with a rich, spicy peanut sauce that I'd love to have over some brown rice and vegetables sometime.   My only complaint is I think they could survive toning it down a bit on the salt. It's definitely overboard and I would have enjoyed my meal just as much had it contained less. I subtract no stars, as I was practically licking my plate!   Overall, this menu is expansive without sacrificing quality, and surprisingly affordable and accessible. If you're in central Phoenix already, most definitely consider going a bit far up north to check out what Veggie Village has to offer.",

Basically it's like a Thai restaurant that does only vegetarian and vegan meals.  The service was very friendly from beginning to end.  Everything came out quickly.  I had a tofu curry soup which was excellent.  There was some kind of crispy layered tofu in it that was really good.  Their fried tofu satay was really great; everyone had that and loved it.  The cream cheese puffs (vegetarian crab puffs) were also very good, and different from most others.  Their shell is a bit thicker and very crispy, with a very good flavor.  When the cook heard that I like extra spicy, they made up a special sauce that was a very nice addition to my curry.  Also, the portions on everything were quite huge.    Prices are reasonable.",

I will definitely go here again the menu has so much stuff on it I couldn't decide what to order and I wanted to order everything. I wish they had a sampler platter for an appetizer!

It was definitely way too much food for two, but we were happy with our leftovers! Everything was delicious! It took a few tries with the mushroom \"meat\" but I really began to enjoy it. Amazing what they can do with mushrooms!! And that's coming from someone that doesn't really like mushrooms to begin with!!   There's so many other things that we'd love to try on the menu. I really can't wait for return to this place!!!",

The menu is actually influenced by Singapore.  We started the meal with the letuce wraps. I really liked the texture contrast from the \"meat\" with the fried noodle bits.  For the main items we had general tso mushrooms. They are basically the best fried mushrooms you will ever have with a bit of sauce and some peppers and rice. The great chillie oil they have made it even better. Be sure to eat this ASAP before the sauce can make the breading soggy.  The other dish was a rice noodle dish, other than the fun of veggie shrimp it was nothing too special other than it made a great vehicle for the chillie oil.   I must go back and try more.",

I recommend the stir fry, pot stickers, and burger.  I still have to try to rest of the menu and since it is close to my work, I probably will make it a habit to go in for lunch weekly.  Even if you are not a meat eater, I strongly suggest giving Veggie Village a try, you won't regret it.",

They're Korean glass noodles in a savory sauce and I seriously crave them all the time.. it's an addiction. My boyfriend, who is not vegan, is just as excited about Veggie Village as I am, and he loves all of the \"chicken\" dishes made with fried mushrooms. Everything on the menu can be made vegan, which is a huge plus for me. Also, the two ladies who answer the phone for takeout and man the register are always super sweet and polite!

The rice, light and fluffy, vegetables and pineapple done well, still light and crunchy, and the shrimp delicious.   I ordered the orange chicken which was exceeding far beyond my expectations. A light refreshing orange sauce over the soy chicken with a side of white rice completed our night, Beyond satisfied. Highly recommended even to our carnivorous friends.

As many previous reviewers have noted (thanks, reviewers!), the SALT & PEPPER FISH is outstanding. I almost ordered the S&P tofu, because I don't actually want my vegetarian dish to taste like fish, but this didn't. It was salty and crunchy and the meat substitute was great. It came on a bed of fried basil, green and red peppers and jalapenos. All of it, every bite, was delicious.   GENERAL TSO'S CHICKEN (with fake chicken, not mushrooms) was also delicious. I'd choose the S&P over this the next time, but it was still really tasty. The \"chicken\" was perfectly fried and crispy and held up even under the thick sauce. The sauce was spicy and sweet, exactly what General's should be. I got it with only broccoli, and the broccoli was perfectly steamed, still had a bit of crunch to it. Very good dish.   Daughter had the CHICKEN BURGER with fries and she enjoyed it as well. Although this is clearly an Asian restaurant so the chicken burger might've been the most generic menu item. Despite that, it was still done thoughtfully and well. Vegan mayo, crispy \"chicken\", tomato and cucumber with a nice sesame seed bun. Fries were crinkle cut and perfectly fried and salted.   On top of the delicious food, the staff, including the chef, were eager to help and see if everything was good. It gave me great pleasure to let them all know that the food was excellent. I hope I can visit again soon.",

It came with white rice, mixed veggies, pineapple and imitation pork. The portion size was pretty good too. Maybe not $9 worth but I don't mind paying more for healthier food options.   It was good but kind of bland. I feel like it was missing a sauce or something. I ordered to go and forgot to ask for soy sauce or like a sweet and sour and there was none in the bag so I ended up having the rice straight up.   I walked in during lunch and ordered to go and the process was quick and easy. Took 5 min max to receive my order after placing it. Restaurant was small but decorated nice. Staff was friendly and parking is plentiful and free.   Maybe next time I'll try something different.",

The crab puffs were amazing as well.  Con's: our entrees were 1 star.  The orange chicken was so soggy and there was an excessive amount of sauce. The chicken part was fine, I love fake meat (vegetarian). I didn't finish it and it got less and less appetizing with each bite. It was heavily breaded and the breading was mush.  The eggplant was sooooooooo disappointing. The sauce was bland, bland, bland. & it was a thin sauce. No heat whatsoever. The eggplant weren't cooked all the way through.  The rice was cooked with too much water, it was soggy and falling apart.",

We always split it and leave full but when we get home I'm ready to eat more lol. Their egg rolls are good and the pot stickers are the mvp for appetizer.",

FYI this is a vegetarian spot but can make just about any dish vegan. My go to meal is the kung pao chicken which comes with rice. Get it, you won't regret it!   I've also had the orange chicken, Vietnamese spring rolls, crab puffs and calamari. They were all delicious! The calamari is made from mushroom and taste like the real thing. The orange chicken has a very strong orange flavor since they use real oranges to flavor the dish but it is fresh. The spring rolls are fat and come with a home made peanut sauce.   The staff is always friendly and they are quick to take your order. I was on a time crunch today and was in and out for lunch within 30 minutes.",

The tofu was the most fun to eat with variety of texture and a little spice, but it wasn't as flavorful as I would have liked.  The mushrooms were a surprise hit to me with their texture.  And pretty much everyone loves a wonton, right?  For entrees, we had the Kung Pao and the General's \"chick'n\".  Both were very tasty.  I like the layer the peanuts add to the Kung Pao.  Definitely enjoyed everything.  Looking forward to getting back and trying some of the other dishes on the menu!",

    "text": "Three of the kids and I decided to try Veggie Village. Yup. Vegetarian and vegan food. And it was the choice of number 3.  We started with appetizers. We ordered Edamame, Pot Stickers and Hakka Tofu. The kids said the Edamame was good and well seasoned. They said the Pot Stickers were really good and so was the sauce.   The Hakka Tofu was really good. It had cucumber, carrots and a great sauce. Definitely had some kick.   I order the Salt and Pepper Tofu. It included peppers, seaweed and jalapenos. It had a slight kick, but really just a good flavor. It also came with rice.   Number 2 ordered Curry Noodle. It had soy beef, tofu and rice noodles in a curry broth. He liked the broth. It was mildly spicy. He also liked the tofu.  Number 3 got Wonton Soup sans mushrooms. She said it was \"a ton of good leafy things.\" Apparently it has kale, peas and wontons with soy protein. The broth is light. She said she would order it again.  Number 4 ordered the Vietnamese Pho. It had soy beef, rice noodles, bean sprouts and basil in a vegetable broth. He liked it and would order it again. His favorite part was, of course, the noodles.  The restaurant is two rooms. There was room in the room you enter into, but we were seated in the other room. They turned on the lights and there was a woman eating at a table in the corner. That seemed odd.  It got weirder when she proceeded to facetime people with loud volume. We could hear the whole conversation. As if that wasn't rude enough and an exhibit of a complete lack of self awareness, she cursed and said things not appropriate in a public place and 15 feet from kids.   The last call sounded like it was a guy she was being set up with through a dating app. That was freaking odd.   Would have said something, but assumed the response I would get would not be pleasant and wouldn't be worth it.  So the food was really good. We will come back. We won't be seated by the rude facetimer if she happens to be there again.  The kids really thought it was a 4.5, but lowered the rating for the lack of accountability of the waitresses in not asking the woman to stop disturbing the others in the restaurant.",

    "text": "\"If you ask me one more time if I'm a vegetarian...\"   Those are the words that nearly come out of my mouth every time we eat here.   They say it in such a hopeful voice too. I have been here at least a half dozen times, and each time they have the same question.  Seriously? Why? Is that a license to eat here or something?  Yes, we know the difference between Vegetarian and Vegan. And yes, we know how to order these types of foods because we often dine in places such as these. Although we don't eschew meat, we do like having all veggies for a meal on occasion.  This is probably one of our favorite places at the moment. They've actually supplanted Loving Hut for a little bit now.  My wife says that they actually made a veggie burger that actually lives up to the claim that it tastes like meat. They do have similar dishes to other vegan and vegetarian chains, but they seem to just do it all better. Their faux meats are savory, and definitely not your run of the mill soy mixtures. That veggie burger that I mentioned earlier? It actually has a reddish center as if it was cooked medium rare. And those sauces! Oh my gosh...they are absolutely delectable.  To top it all off, their Cucumber Mint Lemonade is overwhelmingly refreshing. We have about a dozen refills when we dine here. Okay, that's a slight exaggeration. It's only a HALF Dozen refills!  On our recent trip here, after VB, we explored their soup selections. While the Won Ton Soup had succulent and fresh vegetables. The broth needed a little bit more zest.  Nonetheless, this place still is worth the visit, time and time again!",

If love dark rich chocolate you'll love this cake, I highly recommend you get. It's VEGAN and Gluten free!!! It's made locally, and served at the restaurant.  My husband and I went around 1pm on Valentines Day! This place is a great, vegetarian with a ton of Vegan options (most of the menu). We indulged in 2 appetizers, 2 main dishes, Jasmine tea. The pics speak for themselves. The food reasonable priced.  The service was superb, our waitress answered our many questions and offered helpful suggestions for best dishes. We definitely plan to come here the next time we're in Phoenix.",

We had tofu appetizer that was si much better than the normal pile of fried tofu and a dish if sauce. The tofu was underneath layers of fabulous fresh veggies like jicama, bean sprouts and carrots with peanuts and delicious sauce drizzled on top. It was so good i could eat it as a meal! The Kung Pao vegan chicken was fabulous. Instead of tofu, which can be overused in vegetarian recipes, the \"v-chicken\" was marinated mushroom coated and quick fried to give them a wonderful crispy exterior. The sauces for everything were spot on perfect!",

Both were very good, but I preferred the fresher, lighter Vietnamese rolls to the fried spring rolls, if I had to pick one for next time. The vegetarian ham was interesting, and yummy! For entrees, we got the Xu-yiang Eggplant and the Orange \"Chicken\". The chicken was good, and the addition of orange peel was unexpected and appreciated. The eggplant was amazing, and we loved the sauce it came in. It reminded me of Thai Basil's eggplant. Overall, we'd come back for the food. It was unique, well-seasoned, and set itself apart from the usual Asian fusion.  Service: Ordering was pretty easy, but the waitress was uncommunicative and not at all helpful at communicating to us what the most popular items were. She didn't say anything to us when she brought our food or water, and we didn't get any drink refills while we were there, even though we were the only people in the whole restaurant (it's not that big, and we went for an early weekday dinner, so this wasn't a red flag or anything).   Overall, very good food and pretty strange service. If you can look past the service, this place is a go-to for vegan and vegetarian at a really good price.",

    "text": "My husband and I where in town to make a trip to the Grand Canyon. And me as a vegan could not find any vegan options, until I found this place on yelp. We BOTH Loved it! Yes, even my meat loving husband loved his place. The to-fu pad Thai was great! And very savory.(I got mine non-spicy) we also ordered pot stickers and hose where also so amazing. Just on those alone I was feeling full. And that lead to my next comment about the amount of food you are served it was very much worth what you are paying for a good hearty amount! We really loved this place and wish it was in San Antonio Texas. But until then we Will just have to wait till we are in Phoenix next time. There service was great to. Love supporting local business that are run by hard working families. So do not hesitate to give this place a try. :)",

    "text": "I love the food here and will return again and again until I've sample the entire menu.   ....however...  I recommend that you don't go there if you are going to arrive more than an hour before they close. In fact, if it's getting late you may want to call ahead and ask how late they are actually willing to serve.   We arrived at 8:30 pm Friday evening. Closing time posted on the door was at 9:00 - even though the hours on yelp and their website say 9:30. We were rushed to order, appetizers arrived and the entrees showed up about 4 minutes later so we had a huge jam of plates and bowls on the table. At 10 minutes after 9:00 one of the employees (maybe the owner / manager?) stood and glared at us. It was very uncomfortable.   We were a party of 4, ordered appetizers, beverages and entrees and we tip well - but didn't feel very welcome during our stay.   Maybe they just need to adjust their hours and say they close at 8:00 pm?",

I ordered wide noodles and just asked them to put in fried tofu and veggies and hold all the fake meats...they did this for me no problem. The noodles were super tasty! I also tried the potstickers, which were surprisingly good (most veggie potstickers are so sad). The prices were reasonable with most dishes costing around 10$.

It usually comes with some mock meats that aren't gluten free, so I asked for the gluten free option. They brought out my dish and it was just noodles with a couple of over cooked veggies and it appears to have been mixed with some gluten free soy sauce? The woman who took my order didn't mention nothing would be put in the dish to replace the mock meat. It was totally bland, void of texture and overall a disappointment. My husband ordered the same thing and we were so annoyed we basically just took it to go and went out to lunch elsewhere. I was able to take it home, add some sauces, tofu and added some of my own cooked veggies that weren't complete mush, so it wasn't a total loss. But I don't go out to eat to have to redo the meal at home....",

I love vegan food and have a lot of respect for vegan's so I decided today I want to try out a vegan restaurant in the area. My husband knows of vegan meat meat but his first choice would be fast food. Before bringing it up to him that I already had I mind where I wanted to go I yelp searched vegan and up popped Veggie Village. It had good reviews and it's Asian inspired which is a plus because my husband loves orange chicken. So I convinced him and we headed our way.  As we walked in we were immediately greeted with menus and seated. Staff was friendly and made accommodations to my meal. I ordered the lettuce wraps and my husband order the orange chicken lunch special. As we waited for our food I kept hoping he would like the food the last thing I would want to do is make him hate vegan meat. Our food came out pretty quickly although we were the only ones there at the time. As he took the first couple of bites I waited and asked \"how is it?\" He said \"this is really good!\" My heart felt so happy! And my lettuce wraps were yummy too! We will be back. And to top it off we got full off the plates which is a plus! All very affordable as well.",

You don't expect it to be a small establishment so when you walk in its kind of a surprise, but don't let the size fool you!  It is very nice and clean on the inside and I love the paragraph on the wall to remind veg heads why they live the lifestyle they do and to educate meat eaters who don't understand! I went around lunch time so it was a few groups of people already inside eating. The lady who took my order was very friendly and she helped me decide if I should go for the Spiced Salt Fish bento box or just get the entree by itself. She educated me on what I would get on either decision and so I went with the bento box because it's a dollar less and you get more things with it!  I dined in and sat down and she brought me a water without me even asking, very good customer service in my opinion because who doesn't like water (if you don't you're weird!)? It only took about 5 minutes for my food to be ready and put on my table. I was a little skeptical with the soup and the egg roll that I got because I've never been fond of egg rolls, but the lady promised the soup was really good! The mock fish was soooo good it's unreal! I don't necessarily like spicy foods but I was eating everything even the jalapenos (I know, not really spicy at all)! And the egg roll and soup were tasty as well!  Overall I had a great experience with this place and will definitely take the trip from Tempe to North Phoenix again just to eat there. I would love to try something else from the menu but what I had was so good I feel like I won't want to try anything else! Now I know why this place has a 5 star rating!",

I ordered the vegan eggplant & tofu dish with brown rice for lunch today, and I was so blown away by how pretty and delicious this dish was. The rice was cooked perfectly. There was plenty of tofu, and the eggplant was so fresh. I can't wait to go back to try more dishes from this establishment. Keep up the good work peeps.

    "text": "Stopped in at Veggie Village today to try them out. The inside is nicely remodeled. The restaurant is very clean, contemporary, casual and inviting, with comfortable booths.  We got their bento box lunch specials, which are just $8. The specials come jam-packed with an entree, rice, a fried springroll, salad and soup! Super combo ftw! Everything on the menu is vegan with the exception of the cream cheese wontons.   We opted for the Tom Yam fish and the sesame v chicken. Tom Yam fish was spicy and very flavorful.   The v chicken were tasty and unique! They use mushrooms battered and fried for the sesame \"chicken\". Really enjoyed them! The sesame sauce was thick & sweet, as is traditional for that sauce. I'd probably get the sauce on the side next time just so that it's not so overwhelming, but that's the case for just about any sesame or orange sauce style dish.  They also have other vegan chicken that use a more traditional soy-chicken style and some other mock meats. Looking forward to trying out the other items on the menu!  Suggestions for the owner: Use vegan cream cheese in your wontons to go 100% vegan! Serve the soup a bit hotter (temperature). Take the corn off the cob in the soup. Offer vegan desserts!",

The wontons were so tasty and tasted fresh and tender with a variety of veggies.  I highly recommend. We also got the Tom Yam Fish which was flavorful and perfect texture. The honeydew chia juice had a great flavor. Honeydew isn't usually one of my favorites but this was refreshing. The service was fast and folks were kind. I wish I was eating there right now. ')",

Non stop talking to two customers for the entire time we were there.  And loud!  I don't think we were the only customers who were agitated.  I literally ran out of the door when we were done.  Most unpleasant.  Please leave the kid at home or in the back next time.",
