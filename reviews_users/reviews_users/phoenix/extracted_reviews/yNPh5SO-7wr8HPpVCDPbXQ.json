Loved the pretzel dip (I'm slightly obsessed with little cast iron coquottes!) and the salad was incredible.  And huge, I might add--I took half mine home for dinner.  Everyone was incredibly kind and welcoming, and I came back for dinner a few days later :)",

There were quite a few empty tables. We were told there would be a 20 min. wait. So we sat down on the bench. No one filled the empty tables. Two guys came in and were told 20 minutes, and left. After 15 minutes of me watching this idiotic charade, the hostess came and said they had a cancellation, so we could be seated. More tables had emptied and were never filled while we were waiting, and during our meal, more emptied and were never filled. I thought about the two guys that left. They were lied to like we were...for what purpose, I have no idea. I guess you have to prove you want to eat there bad enough...and being a business owner nearby, I can't help but think that, at least to the employees, profit is not a concern. Why would I want to go back? I don't.",

It was a prefixed menu, and I was delightfully surprised to find a vegetarian option! Just for the record, this is the only vegetarian entree on the menu.   Dinner started out with a Simple Chopped Salad. This was your standard chopped salad with a light and fruity dressing. I ordered the Sweet Potato Tortelli for my entree, and I was absolutely blown away!! It was sweet, savory, and so flavorful! In fact, everyone sitting around me wanted to taste it because it smelled so good. I wanted some type of bread on the side, and the server brought me toasted bread with balsamic vinegar. For dessert, I had the Blueberry Cheesecake and it was the perfect ending to my meal. The crumble on top was crunchy, and the cheesecake was the perfect sweetness. I did taste the Salted Carmel Pudding and it was delicious as well. Personally too sweet for me, but delicious none the less. I loved how the desserts were served in individual mason jars.   The service was great, and I would definitely recommend hosting an events here. The staff was very attentive and the party room felt like it was part of the restaurant but secluded at the same time. Overall, I give this place 4 stars only because there is no vegetarian variety. The service was great too. My coworkers enjoyed the place and said they would return.",

We decided The Arrogant Butcher and was impressed from the moment we sat down to the moment we left. We ordered the butcher's platter to start and we ate everything. Every sauce complimented the meat and cheese perfectly and the bread was the die for. For entree's, I ordered the pork schnitzel with the spinach and kale while my boyfriend ordered the meatloaf and loaded baked potato. We had to share with each other because it was so good. There were plenty of leftovers too! The service was exceptional as well!",

    "text": "2 stars if only for the food (etc.) The additional star is for the wonderfully cheery petite girl working behind the bar.   The experience started off odd as I guess I expected this spot to be a little more cool and quaint instead of situated next to a Tilted Kilt (the \"Scottish\" Hooters). I'm sure the ambiance is much better at night when there is controlled lighting versus the sun blazing in from all the windows. Anyways, my misconception and this has in no way affected my score.  Then it didn't help when I walked in on an employee standing up with the hostesses at the entrance loudly bitching about something. All seemingly in agreement. So I just interjected with an..\"I'll just eat the bar\", since I was rolling solo. Followed by an awkward look exchange with a member of staff standing behind the bar that I was now sitting at. It was something of a forced smile or perhaps he was squinting due to sun coming in from the window...either way he spoke no words.  Instantly things got better as my bar server approached to greet me and offer a beverage and a lunch menu. Such a cutie pie this one and nice as nice can be. And she never let my water get anywhere close to empty and I was drinking it like a fish.  Often I have trouble deciding on what to order and like to request the assistance of my server who has undoubtably eaten everything on the menu or at least has seen it, so I ask the ray of sunshine which she preferred out of the smoked salmon and the crispy shrimp. Without hesitation she informs me, \"crispy shrimp!\", her favorite thing. Sold. And I also order the simple chopped salad ($5)  Well if that was the best thing I worry about the rest of the menu. Sure they came out hot and crispy but there was very little flavor. I actually had to salt them. ( perhaps they took Angie M.'s review to heart too soon). The sauce was good but only when used sparingly. The portion was generous but for $13 bucks that should not just be \"filling\".   The simple chopped salad was alright but very overdressed, rather soggy and the vinegar level in the dressing made my lips burn a bit. It was also topped with a powdered \"cheese\" similar to that that comes in packets with delivery pizza.  I left full but thinking I made the wrong decision on where to eat, because it was not worth the 24 bucks it cost here for lunch. If this restaurant is smart though they will never let go of that little girl behind the bar. She is a gem.",

The oysters from Washington were of decent quality. I had the salmon which was cooked very nicely with a good crispy flakiness. My guest, who was visiting from back east, had the smoked salmon. Although it was completely different than he normally has it, he enjoyed it. Pretty standard fare, but it is well done. Pretty loud ambiance, but you're able to hold a conversation.  I would recommend this as a solid place to have dinner friends for those who are visiting and don't know the area.",

Regardless of my party size, I think the most important take away from my review that follows is that my taste buds are actually still reminiscing about the meal a week & a half later.  We were sat in the cozy private room to the right corner of the restaurant for our company dinner. Upon finding our seats, we were immediately greeted by our friendly server who brought an unexpected starter basket of warm hot pretzels with cheese and a basket of fried shrimp w/fried peppers and a zesty dipping sauce.   We had a preset menu choice of salmon w/veggies (Brussel sprouts); beef; or chicken stuffed with crab & a veggie side. For dessert, we had the choice of salted caramel pudding or pumpkin cheesecake w/compote.  I went with the salmon and pumpkin cheesecake and SO glad I did. I really hope this is available to any of you on the main menu because it's something worth coming here for. Also, don't expect to overeat as the portions were typical of a high end dining experience.   I didn't think seafood in the desert could ever be so good. The glaze and char marks were perfect to my pallette. I'm a huge fan of brussel sprouts, especially ones with a little char and was happy to see halves in the vegetable mix under the salmon (I only wish there was a little more).   The pumpkin cheesecake was served in a mini jam-like jar with the cheesecake part on the bottom, fruit on top and crumbled crust on top. Needless to say, it was love at first bite. I kindly shared in exchange for a bite of the salted caramel pudding which was also good but nothing in comparison from my point of view.  The restaurant was packed of what seemed like diners happy to be enjoying the experience there. I only wish I lived closer so that I could return sooner!",

Nowhere on the menu do you see size of serving, until you receive the dish. For instance filet Mignon is only 8oz, the broccoli was mushy and honestly the presentation for $39 dish is unacceptable! Having said that, the meat itself was perfectly cooked and tender , but make sure you order some sides with your dish as it doesn't come with anything. I am sure other serving may be acceptable, but from what I saw the butchers table is less than acceptable for the price. Sure if the dish was cheaper maybe my view would change, but I expect a good size portion of meat for the money, especially if you throw in a side and a beer, you won't get any change from $60! Sorry to disappoint, but arrogant butcher is indeed arrogant if it thinks it can serve this size dish for that price and get away with it. Ask for the size of your meat before you make an order!",

The atmosphere is pleasant and enjoyable.  But the food?  I found it to be overpriced for what it was.  The pretzels and provolone fondue? Meh.  That cheese is just nothing to write home about.  It may be provolone, but it just doesn't taste much better than what you get at a movie theater or Auntie Anne's.  For an entree, I had the Sweet Potato Tortelli.  I found this to be on the mushy side and quite bland.  I have a feeling this place does well due to clever marketing, cutesy name (sister restaurant is the lackluster Culinary Dropout which also carries those pretzels), and cool semi upscale atmosphere.",

I ordered the short rib stew, it was good, but on the acidic side, and I know tomatillos are acidic, but there are techniques to bring it down a bit. Also, green peppers are supposed to be roasted and peel removed, there are techniques for that, too, or you end up with unpleasant plastic-like peels in the sauce.",

But for those seeking a nice draft beer, don't come here. But Coors and Modelo are not the only lager beers, Phx beer buyers!  Food was ok. Happy hour ok. We had dinner before. D'Backs game. Ribs were ok. Jambalaya way too spicy. Kale salad very good as was Cesar salad.  Could be much better. But isn't awful.",

Reserved the boardroom for a special family event. It was set up and ready to go even though we got there early. Pre-ordered a birthday dessert. Perfect timing and presentation with no prompting from me.  Awesome craft cocktails. Good selection of local beers. GREAT menu choices.  I am ashamed to admit how many appetizers we \"tried\" (hey, its all for YOU, my readers!!).  Highly recommend the nachos as a share plate, good flavors, good quantity.  Pretzel fondue YES. White Shrimp Cocktail was over the top tasty and fresh grated horseradish was appreciated!  Fresh sliced crisp jalapenos on the side as requested.   Every entree was well received and perfectly executed (would definitely order all of it again, nothing was \"meh\").    Special shout-out to Celeste who has the patience of a saint and got her \"Steps\" in for the day with my crew.  Her patience was tested and that smile never slipped!  Bravo!",

The menu is a bit limited compared to some others places you might visit but that's not a bad thing. Have a solid selection of dishes done really well instead of 100 choice done mediocre is a great thing.   The shrimp appetizer was fantastic. Super easy to over-cook shrimp but this was cooked perfectly. With a nice light batter instead of heavy breading and a few shishito peppers tossed in this is something I would order again.   The sea bass was also a solid choice. Again, we found perfectly cooked fish that remained moist and tasty in an average sized dish.   The jambalaya was good, but nothing to right home about. Decent portion size, and absolutely nothing to complain about just wasn't a standout compared to the others.   Great location to stop before a D'backs or Suns game! Give ti a try, you won't be disappointed.",

We arrived during happy hour thinking we totally scored on drink specials. Our server explained in detail that the happy hour drinks were of a lesser quality than the regular menu drinks. That's not happy hour. That's ordering a well drink.  We ordered the pretzel bites as an appetizer. They arrived 5 minutes AFTER we finished eating our meal. For dinner I had the sweet potato tortellini with mushrooms and spinach that wasn't half bad. For dessert we got the salted caramel pudding due to it's high recommendation. It left us very unsatisfied and even more disappointed in our dining experience. I don't think we will be back to The Arrogant Butcher.",

Good place for a date night, but as it started to get darker, the music got louder, darker, and clubby.. If that's a word. The cheese fondue is yummy but incredibly dosed with kosher salt if you're into that. I got the ribs and hubby got the prime rib.. Both were incredibly delicious and moist, not the best we've ever had, but far above the worst. Drinks are very strong, and strangely they didn't ask for my ID (maybe I am starting to look my age!) Fries are run-in-the-mill, not exceptionally crunchy or flavorful. The value for the money is definitely there though, we left with lots of leftovers.   Waitress was very nice and answered all of our questions, and even suggested a parking garage we could use next time to park by closer, and that they validate parking. A must come back.",

The inside looks great- modern, clean, very large. A bit noisy but hey, it's Saturday night. I went with the fish tacos while my boyfriend stuck to his usual burger and, as we usually do, we split halfsies. The burger was tasty, though nothing spectacular- worth the price. The tacos were pretty bland- not much flavor and they only give you two in corn tortillas with a small wedge of avocado in esch. Not worth the $17 what so ever, and I'm usually not one to complain. The staff was friendly, the place is a fun spot to be at, but be sure to choose your plates wisely.",

The beer list isn't that great and I was underwhelmed with my cocktail of choice, \"The Polish Fix\".  Not bad but not delicious like I expect a good quality (expensive) mixed drink to be.

I have made it a point to try all of the Phoenix City Scape restaurants and become familiar with the lunch menus of these restaurants.  Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by a graciously hip host who made us feel very welcomed. The ambiance of the restaurant was pretty cool and the location is perfect for downtown lunch commuters.   I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and my friend has the cobb salad. The turkey pastrami sandwich was really amazing and the lunch portions were satisfying enough. I am not a big turkey fan but I will be calling this one of my all time favorite sandwiches, the coleslaw that accompanies that sandwich adds much need texture and is also refreshing. The fresh parmesan fries were great as well.  Plan on visiting this place during your lunch break if you have an hour or more. The place was not busy and it took around 25-30 minutes to receive a sandwich and a salad. This is the only reason why I did not rate a 5/5.   But overall great resaturant, good food, good prices, good ambience, good drinks, and great experience. Will visit again soon.",

I decided for the grilled salmon as my entree, I've got to say that fillet was the driest thing I have ever had in my life.

We started with a glass of wine and beer, and ordered the pretzel fondue. Beer was good, wine was just okay but I expect a better selection from this caliber of restaurant. The pretzels were terrible- hard and way over salted and the cheese had a strange texture, like it had been sitting out for a bit before making it to the table and candle barely lit and went out. We only ate about a third of the appetizer because we were starving. Hoping the entrees were better, we ordered the cheeseburger, which was extremely disappointing for us both. First, the burger barely contained cheese, and they were so tiny they were like the size of sliders in a giant bun. Also, the bottom bun contained some kind of house sauce that was not listed on the menu, and not knowing what it was, I tossed it aside. I took the top of the bun and cut it in half and easily fit my entire burger in it. Then we tasted the burgers and they were just terrible. It tasted like some kind of sauce was mixed into the meat, but we couldn't put our fingers on what it was. The fries were nothing special, and the side salad with champagne vinaigrette was okay- the best of what we ate. I am disappointed that given what we ate (or didn't eat) that we were not offered to remove at least meal. I can say that we will never return here again and very sorry we wasted a gift card here.",

I felt like it was really high priced for food that didn't seem special. The ribs were really good, but not much different than others that I have had. The Chicken with crab was not bursting with flavor.  Service was great. Good drink options, really fun atmosphere, just not a favorite overall.",

There were some thinly sliced salumi and prosciutto to lay atop the toasted and drizzled with balsamic slices of french bread. A soft spreadable cheese and a buttery chunk cheese. A wonderful little pot of salmon confit. The madeleines were actually jalapeno cornbread! Some marinated olives and a few stuffed Peppadews. The deviled eggs were the only thing in need of a bit more. Perhaps a splash of spice? Overall, the most amazing meal I've had to date in Phoenix!",

    "text": "Went here after a conference in the downtown area for dinner one night. I came later than everyone else, who was told there would be a 10 minute wait for 6 people. It wasn't 10 minutes before they were seated, so I joined them inside. Our table mates had ordered a few appetizers I happily shared. The smoked salmon dip was good, the pretzels and cheese were amazing and the artichoke dip was good. There is an off dollop of sour cream on the artichoke dip that didn't really belong, but it was tasty all the same.  I ordered the turkey pastrami and opted for a side salad instead of fries. The salad came with a champagne vinaigrette, which I wish came in bottles for purchase because it's so good! The turkey seemed like it was smoked or slow roasted and was way better than I expected for a sandwich. Many others at the table got steak, and one ordered the fish and chips. We all enjoyed it very much! Food deserves 5 stars, but it's a very loud restaurant and it closes at 9, so I couldn't give it more than 4 stars in my opinion.  The service deserves its own special shout out, as our server was kind and attentive and always refilled our water. It was a little hard to communicate because of the noise, but he patiently repeated every order until he heard us all correctly. It was also incredibly impressive that one in our party ordered to go dessert but forgot it at the table- and he ran after us to make sure she got her dessert! We were all over the moon at this kind of care and attention.",

For food we started out with oysters which where prefect. We ordered the chefs creation Butchers plate. It was over priced but still really good.   Jambalaya was spot on. Spicy, very flavorfully and piping hot. I tried a salad with steak and that too was delicious.   Our assigned server was not the greatest but whatever. It happens.  Parking was a nightmare. So, do what I later found out you can do instead...park in the parking garage next to the restaurant and you will get a ticket from the restaurant to give the parking attendant so that you do not have to pay $10 for parking. You will need the money; this place ain't cheap.   Overall, you should try this place out.",

We were a somewhat complicated table, splitting bills and being on a time-crunch, but he handled everything with grace.  We ordered the pretzel bites to start, which are DANGEROUS! I could eat a whole basket by myself.  The food was delicious and they have a great selection of wines. I ordered the Prime Rib, which you can only get on Saturdays. It was truly cooked to perfection! I also tried the scallops and the filet, both of which melt in your mouth.  Overall, the Butcher is a cool spot right in the heart of downtown. It's worth a try!  PRO TIP: The hostesses won't seat you until your whole group has arrived and they don't accept reservations. If you're meeting a group or headed over to a sporting event or concert across the street, make sure to give yourself ample time!",

    "text": "I used to go here every time that I attended a concert at the venue across the street.  So clearly when I scored some last minute awesome seats for MUSE, my go-to dinning spot was obviously The Arrogant Butcher.  But this time, something just wasn't right.  I understand that a restaurant so close to a large event arena would want to turn tables over as fast as they can to accommodate the many customers waiting for a table but...Seriously?!?...I have never felt so rushed to get through a meal before.  The pretzel bread and cheese appetizer is a must, so naturally that is what I was about  of the way through when my salad arrived.  I didn't think much of it because I can multi task while having dinner conversation with my friend but when an attempt to deliver entrees was made about 5 minutes into my salad (appetizer still not finished), I was a little annoyed.  What surprised me was that when I told the server that I was not ready for the entree yet and would like to finish my appetizer and salad first, I received a very confused look from her as if no one had ever done that to her before (even though, clearly there was no room on the table to drop the plate anyway).  Not that I care to be acknowledged when I leave a restaurant, but as we were leaving, I found it a little strange that there were six ladies up at the hostess stand and not a single one turn to say goodbye and thank me when we left.  Having known people who have worked for this restaurant in the past, I know for a fact that their standards and expectations of the staff are very high.  I am hoping this was just an \"off night\" because I really used to enjoy this restaurant.  I may think twice about my choice of restaurant when I attend my next concert.",

Pretty packed during lunch hour, but got a seat right away at the bar. I know a lot of people recommended the app: House Soft Pretzel and Provolone Fondue, but didn't feel like it. Instead, I ordered Crispy Shrimp with Shishito Peepers & Spicy Aioli. For entree I ordered BBQ Half Chicken Plate served with Potato Puree, Gren Chile Cornbread, Coleslaw and BBQ Chicken Jus. The app was good but quite greasy on the bottom. The main dish was also okay, the chicken was not as flavorful as I expected. The bartender's service was great, he was busy but still able to be attentive. I'll give this place another try and order something else if I am around the area again.",

We also tried the oysters, which are fresh and aromatic. Just refreshing and the 2 sauces coming with it perfect the dish.",

    "text": "Wonderful experience and terrific food. We found the place with a little difficulty but worth the trouble, Arrived with no reservation and starving after a long flight from Boston. Staff were very hospitable and offered us seats overlooking the kitchen- although not a fan of watching all that we thoroughly enjoyed the experience. The staff works incredibly well together to make sure everything leaving the kitchen is perfect. It was. Nice to see so many people performing their jobs well and enjoying what they do!      My husband had the prime rib which was done to perfection and I had their awesome brussle sprouts and the popcorn shrimp which were equally delicious.      Only sorry that this place is not in Boston where we would be regulars.       Forgot our servers name but she was spot on , too! Arrogant Butcher is anything but arrogant! Thank you.",

    "text": "Food wasn't bad, but I also wasn't incredibly blown away. In retrospect, it's very possible we didn't make the best dining decisions though.   We'd JUST missed Happy Hour by a few minutes, and decided to sit outside to enjoy the sunset. If I came back, I'd probably sit inside since the decor and ambiance inside seemed very special.   Food: Zucchini Fritters - omg. AMAZING. Would definitely get again!! Beef Short Rib Stew - I think maybe this wasn't my cup of tea. I found it to be a little overly salted, and I forgot I don't love cornbread. I'd try something else next time around.  Drinks: Tried some of my friend's lavender drink and another friend's strawberry drink and both were good. Not overly sweet but not too dry either.  Service was SO sweet (including when I cut my finger under a table outside), but I found it to be just a tad slow. To be fair though, my friends and I were seated so it's very possible we were out of close proximity to frequent service. We were also in a rush to make it to the symphony, so that could have set the tone for maybe skewed perception of time.",

I had the prime rib (medium) with potato au gratin. The prime rib had a pleasant smokey flavor as they use their smoker to hold their prime ribs at temp after they are finished in the oven.   My wife had the diver scallops on a bed of wilted spinach (substituted from cream corn). They were perfectly cooked and buttery tasting.",

Really nice place to hang at. A decent menu where they had a selection of food and drink options. I selected the fish and chips. And ordered the \"After school special\" cocktail which I asked the server about ahead of time, as it has tequila in it, and I'm not a huge fan of it's flavor but I do drink it. Server said that the ginger and beer flavors would wipe out the taste, which had they did. It wasn't a great drink, it was just average.   The fish and chips on the other hand was a hit for me. Good flaky fish and the batter was very light. I would definitely come back if in the area, despite the fact there are other options near by, but this place was decent. Personally not a fan of chain restaurants but Fox Restaurant Concepts have been doing a great job here in Arizona. Good menus and flavorful dishes.",

It was small and had very little flavor. The bread was dry and without the au juis, would have been hard to eat. I ended up eating the meat off the bread because it was just too much. I didn't like the beer selection, and the one that I ordered was way too sweet.  As far as the service, our waiter was slightly obnoxious. He was trying to be funny or whimsical, but it came off as annoying. Especially when our food took way to long to come out. He didn't even mention it or apologize, he just kept flirting with the girls at the table next to us.  We ended up missing the beginning of the baseball game, even though we told him we were trying to make it there in time. This place is just a fancy covering over an okay chain restaurant.",

It had a sort of old fashioned modern chop house feel and a very unique menu; however, the food was extremely rich and very salty.  I notice most of the Fox Restaurant foods always leave me thirsty for days.  The house soft pretzels and provolone fondue was really good.  The grilled swordfish with arthichokes was also extremely good but way too salty as was the ribeye my boyfriend ordered.    Service was great, especially for a soft opening.    I will definitely give brunch a try in the near future but probably will only visit for the atmosphere, appetizers and cocktails in the future.",

You can pay extra for some steak toppings such as lump crab meat or shrimp, but be forewarned those sides are miniscule.  Not worth the price - stick with just the filet and the sides it comes with.  Plenty of food.  Be sure to order to pretzel bread with cheese as an appetizer!",

    "text": "The little lady and I have been to the Arrogant Butcher countless times, it is one of our downtown standbys that we visit time and time again. Usually we go for happy hour, but this time we went for a basic dinner. Some family was in town for the holidays, and wanted to try something new. We suggested one of the two new great pizza places downtown, not thinking that some places are closed on a Monday night. After getting downtown and paying $10 for parking (there was a Suns game), we realized our mistake. Luckily just steps away The Arrogant Butcher saved the day.   We started our meal for six with pretzels (one of our favorites), oysters (we have been told by an insider that they are flown in daily, and the quality backs it up), and hummus. All were excellent and quickly devoured by the table. For entrees, our group chose the pork chops, two orders of the short rib stew, the scallops, the crap stuffed chicken and the chicken stroganoff. I had previously thought the stew was the best thing on AB's menu, but I had never had the pork chops before. I may have to reevaluate that ranking. The chops were moist and flavorful. They had a breading on them that was crunchy and done really well. Paired with the mashed taters and veggies, this dish was epic. The stew has a nice little kick and is served with a slice of cornbread, both dishes are amazing. The pairing with the scallops was a little weird (I don't get the whole brussels sprouts thing yet), but they were cooked well and tasty. We have had the scallops in the past which were prepared differently, and we thought they were great. I was told the crab to chicken ratio was a little off, but the dish was good otherwise. I didn't taste it myself though to verify.   All in all, a great experience as always, great food, great service. They did well and impressed our out of town guests.",

Two out of the four dishes were bland and underwhelming. The crab stuffed chicken although packed with a good amount of crab was nothing to rave about. Chicken was breaded with no flavor. The chicken stroganoff although fresh pasta fell short on any favor profiling and extremely bland. The best dishes were the short rib green chile stew..this was delicious!! I was glad my sister-in-law shared some of hers with us.  The carnitas were also delicious and these two dishes are one of the cheaper meals it on the menu. If you do go, definitely stick with short rib stew or carnitas. Our server was wonderful and the drinks are stiff and that was a definite plus. Other than that, I will not be back for the food regardless how delicious the other two dishes were. Just wasn't impressed.",

The pretzel bites with fondue cheese were amazing but their entree portions were definitely on the small side... I just think for the price, they could do a bit more.

I had the scallops, a bit sandy but that's par for the course, only 4 of them. Pricey, $23, I would of thought 6 for that price. Hubby had the beef short rib stew, he liked it. Guest had fish and chips and she cleaned her plate. Other guest had the chicken stroganoff which looked great. Homemade noodles, he said it needed a bit more sauce. We all split the salted caramel pudding, super sweet but really good. A table over had 3 orders of the ribs and they smelled terrific, I'll order them next time. We were there at 745, we didn't order our entrees until about 845 and by then the prime rib was sold out. That was my first choice, also saw that at other tables and it looked great. Too much time chit chatting! Our waiter was great, he knew we were going to be there for a long time and never rushed us. We hadn't seen these friends in years so it was a great time. 6 beers and 2 ice teas plus entrees and appetizer was $145 plus tip so $175. Not what I want to pay for everyday meals but I'm ok with it. The patio is very comfortable, not too crowded, service was what I wanted, food was good, people watching was fun, I felt very comfortable. Next time we will try indoors and I'll order meat, earlier!",

We dined with another couple and shared the Provolone Fondue with Pretzel buns which had us licking our fingers.  The entree choices included the Chicken Stroganoff, two of the Jambalayas and the Sweet Potato Tortellini.  All were excellent but the Sweet Potato Tortellini took the prize as the most original and delicious dinner.  We had reservations for 4:45 and were seated immediately.  We were surprised at how crowded the restaurant was but City Scape has an ice skating rink set up in the middle of the block so there was a lot of activity in that part of downtown.  We don't get downtown that often but would definitely make a special trip to dine at The Arrogant Butcher again.",

We got there just before the lunch rush and scored a prime table near the windows (tho upon leaving, my friend noted how cozy the sofa-bench tables looked, so I'll aim for one of those next time). Our server, Robert, made even the soup of the day (tomato bisque) sound out of this world. Even after the restaurant filled up, he was attentive and made sure we enjoyed our meal.   We shared a handful of oysters with a mild jalapeno sauce. They could have been a bit briny-ier for my taste. And for entrees, we hit opposite ends of the taste spectrum: I had the pork carnitas, which was mild and sweet, with avocado, cole slaw, and a corn 'pancake,' with only a bit of red onion to balance it out. My friend had the jambalaya, which looked deliciously comforting, but she reported the chicken was dry and overcooked and the shrimp was underseasoned. The bite I tasted was too hot (spice-wise, not temp) for me.   The decor was comforting in a British pub style. I wish the menu had been more unique (burgers, BLT, variety of salads), esp for a place with the wird \"arrogant\" staring at you.   I do plan on returning for dinner, to see what catches my eye.",

First off, during those three years my fiance switched her diet to vegan. So, I was worried when I called A.B. to see if they could accommodate us, but they could not have been more helpful. They crafted a one-of-a-kind vegan dish for my fiance and I had some excellent (non-vegan) ravioli. They then surprised my fiance with a bowl of the freshest fruit for a perfect summer dessert! And, when I mentioned the night's plans when booking reservations, they asked if they could put out flowers for us! We had three roses, one for each year, and they let us keep the vase after! But, far beyond that was how kind and nice everyone was. We really felt special coming here and it kicked off the perfect night! Thank you!",

So many great flavors and textures! 2 of us ate it but it could be stretched to 3. For my entree I ordered the New York Strip. 12oz! It was a very hearty portion. It melted in my mouth. Perfect temperature of medium rare as well. The mashed potatoes weren't as creamy as I prefer but still great and so we're the Brussel sprouts. My friend ordered the crab stuffed chicken which he said was absolutely delicious too. We topped it off with the warm peanut butter cup. We couldn't eat another bite! Though our server kept our glasses full, he spoke to us only once in almost 2 hours to ask me how the temperature was on my steak; not how everything was. It was just a bit odd.",

She was unfriendly the whole time, and specifically told us we couldn't move seats if we wanted our checks to be correct. It was a social visit with people getting up throughout the evening! And when it came time to pay our individual bills, she refused to take my credit card TWICE because she would only take EVERYONE'S payments at one time.

Our server was phenomenal -- total sweetheart and knew how to read her guests. She was right there before drinks dried up and she kept all the courses coming.  The food was pretty descent. Started off with the pretzels, which are more like pretzel bites. But they bring you a piping hot dish of gooey provolone fondue as a dip.   My entree didn't come out as ordered, but I didn't want to wait for them to remake it -- it was sweet potato stuffed pasta with chicken. Our other entree was different than described on the menu. The crab stuffed chicken isn't really \"stuffed.\" It's really just two breaded fillets with crab in between. Both entrees were okay -- nothing spectacular.  Desserts at the Arrogant Butcher are epic. Clearly a lot of creativity goes into designing these sweet treats. The peanut butter cup was my favorite. It's a bowl of warm peanut butter mousse; very airy and light. They add a dollop of chocolate gelato in the center and then serve freshly baked peanut butter cookies on the side. Not at all what I expected, although I was pleasantly surprised. I will be back!",

Second, as if we were in Paris, they have this delicious mussels appetizer with chunks of sausage and french fries piled on top. Thank whomever the brilliant Frenchman was that thought of this, a True chef d'uvre awaits  The only entree i've had here was less than thrilling, the short-rib stew. It came out piping, skin-off the top of your mouth, hot... When ordering short-rib anything I kind of expect...well...short ribs! Not only was this concoction far from tasty (quite bland, really) there was hardly any short rib to speak of, mostly beans, etc. For some unexplainable reason I've ordered this twice with equal disappointment.  They have some interesting looking daily specials like king crab cioppino on friday that I plan on checking out. I'll let you know.  BOTTOM LINE: See ya there for happy hour",

The service in particular was nothing short of spectacular, especially considering the size of the event and the Downtown notables in attendance (Mayor Gordon, City higher-ups, media).   I love the Butcher's view of US Airways Center and Chase Field and its vantage point will only improve if the city can just find a way to utilize that awful parking lot across from the basketball arena. With business reemerging in the warehouse district and baseball season fast approaching, things are definitely looking up for those blocks of Downtown.  Anyway, back to the Butcher. The entrees were well-received. I found my pastrami sandwich on pretzel bread to be way too salty, but I figure I made my own bed ordering cured meat on a pretzel. The crab cake salad, stew, jambalaya, roasted chicken and salmon plates all received enthusiastic thumbs up from our table and the desserts (cheesecake and chocolate cake cups) were delicious.  The bar is a huge square with heavy stone counters, plenty of seating and flatscreens, insuring that the Butcher will be a popular happy hour and pregame destination. There's also a wraparound patio.  Prices seemed friendly, too. I'm not a Fox RC devotee but could see myself becoming a regular at Arrogant Butcher.",

All of the staff are very friendly and on point with everything from the greeting to the goodbye. But let's honestly get down to why we go. The food. I can honestly say that tonight's meal was one of my favorites I have ever ate! I enjoyed to chicken and crab and it was cooked perfectly and was a great portion for the price. It's been a very long time I have done appetizers, entree and desserts, but this restaurant made our night with all three!",

We made our reservation for 6:00 and were seated right away.  Our waitress was Amanda and she was out of this world!  She knew the menu (answered all our questions as we were debating on what to get/offered suggestions). Her service was spot on!   We started off with Potato Fritters which were delicious.  And for our main course we had the special Italian Seafood Stew and the Bolognese off the menu.  Both were outstanding!   The Italian Seafood Stew was a tomato based broth, King crab, Mussels, Swordfish, Halibut and a little bit of pasta.    We did not feel it was expensive and would come back again.  This is my favorite Fox restaurant.  I have dined at Zinburger, Olive and Ivy, True Foods and Culinary Dropout.   My only negative which I shared with the Manager was the lack of signage.  We parked in the garage below CityScape and had to walk all around.  With the construction on Jefferson it was really hard to see the \"A\".  The Arrogant Butcher is located on the southeast side of City Scape near US Airways.",

I couldn't stop eating them--and the sauce, oh the sauces was amazing. Ask for some bread to soak up the sauce, you won't regret it.   I had the ribeye as an entree, and if you like your ribeye with some flavor, char, and a slight caramelization, this is the place. It was tender, juicy, and fantastically scrumptious.   Lastly, I had the hot chocolate cake. It was good, not great but good. I should have known better, I mean, its chocolate cake--nothing special.   I will be coming back Arrogant Butcher.

It is in the heart of the (so-called ) downtown area. The place looked crowded and ALIVE at 9 pm on a Saturday night and this is a plus (as it is not typical of restaurants in Phx).  The food was good and the service was OK but  our server was not the best in taking care of the changes I requested on the standard entree on the menu. She was too excited and loud (as she was training someone who was shadowing her). I liked the food but the server was too nosy as she would ask like every 10 minutes  if we liked what we were eating (Ahem... a little privacy please!, we are trying to have a  conversation here). I got tired of smiling at her whenever she asked IF I WAS DOING OK (OF COURSE, MY MOUTH WAS FULL AND i DID  NOT WANNA BE RUDE).  That said, it is  FUN PLACE with good but small portion food, might  be better with more people.",

    "text": "3 stars in Yelp terms means \"A-OK.\" I went round & round about this but 3 was warranted since upon my latest visit (last night), everything was simply OK. Here is the issue I have with Fox restaurants & have a few examples to back it up: they are inconsistent on all levels. When I go to a restaurant & have an amazing meal, amazing service, & leave feeling full, I expect that same experience the next time, the time after that, & so on. I recognize that the kitchen can have an off night occasionally, but that should not affect everything ordered, portion size, or service for that matter. Here is an example: About a month ago, the hub & I went to AB for lunch. We went in with low hopes since we had a less than delightful meal at Fox's sister restaurant, Culinary Dropout (see scathing review). We were pleasantly surprised with AB. The hub ordered the Saturday special, prime rib with horseradish scalloped potatoes, AMAZING! The portion size was large, the prime rib cooked & seasoned well, but the star was the potatoes which were phenomenal! I was shocked when out of the goodness of his heart (he usually doesn't have a lot of goodness in there), the hubby decided to let me try them. I wish I hadn't now because it is setting in that I will never have those delicious, creamy potatoes again   :( Anyways, I ordered the ribs, which were fall off the bone & were pretty much the epitomy of perfection when it comes to ribs. The fries it came with were pretty decent (I am picky about fries & I ate all of these) & the mayo based, non sweet slaw was a good accompaniment to the sweetly sauced ribs. We also ordered hummas before our meal & I can honestly say that it was the best hummas & flatbread I have ever had! Silky, creamy, salty, sweet, you get it all from this hummas thanks to it being made fresh (along with the pita bread I have reason to believe) & due to the sprinkling of calamata olives & sweet peppers. We literally licked the bowl, that is how good it was. Only complaint is that a couple more pieces of flatbread would have made the flatbread to hummas ratio more equal. So all in all, a delicious, satisfying meal with service on point. Only other complaints were the mixed drinks were puny & the parking can be a bit stressful if you don't venture into downtown Phx much. We are country folk & had no idea which parking garage to go into, it crept up on us several times too late, so around the block we went again & again (one way road systems suck) until we got it right. But that is the case for all downtown Phx businesses so no biggie.  Cut to last night: We decided to divert from the usual Firebirds anniversary dinner & go to AB instead & catch live music next door. Our server was really slow this time, so much that we started to wonder if we even had a server to begin with. When we finally got to talk to her, we ordered the hummas (which was divine yet again, the only consistant thing), hub ordered prime rib special again with those mouthwatering potatoes, & I ordered the sweet potato tortelli which I had seen so many great reviews on. I also tried to get a side of the scalloped potatoes but was told they couldn't do that since they only make enough to go with the prime rib. In my opinion, kinda dumb. If they are that popular, you should be able to order a side of them on the one night they are available, AB just needed to make more. However, in the end, I was actually fine with not getting them because they were not the same as before. They didn't look as good & per the hubby, they were kinda dry with no horseradish flavor. On top of that, his primerib was overly salted (he loves the edge pieces where the seasoning is and they were way too salty, I tried some non edge pieces & felt those were even too salty). It was also undercooked in the middle. It appeared raw & literally jiggled when you poked it. The creamy horseradish we requested was not mixed up enough so the top just tasted like mayo while the bottom of the cup was all radish. My tortelli tasted ok but was not even close to being a full meal. There were 6 small tortellini in a butter sauce with some spinach leaves and a few nuts. This was closer to appetizer size. Needless to say, I finished my dinner in about 5 minutes & had to have a few pieces of the hubbys prime rib to be somewhat satisfied.  I hate to do this but I am going to be particularly hard on Sam Fox. With the price points of these restaurants, I expect a good experience every time. Unfortunately, that has not happened. This same situation happened with Blanco, first time great, 2nd time decent, third time, not impressed at all. Who knows, maybe if I go to Culinary DO again, it will be spectacular. However, I know not to expect that repeatedly. I just don't understand... places like Firebirds & Charlestons have it down pat. I get a great meal at these places every time but with Fox restaurants, I am lucky to get a good meal twice. Only reason to return would be gift card/ someone else paying.",

Wine selection was great and I felt an excellent value, we had a Syrah and a Chardonnay.  I could make a meal out of the pretzel app, that cheese fondue is fantastic.  For the main course we had the Sweet Potato Tortelli and the Turkey sloppy joe, which paired well with our wine selections (I'll give my date credit for that) although we felt the tortelli could have been better.  Sloppy joe was delicious and the fries were perfectly cooked though not extraordinarily flavored (properly salted).  Blueberry cheesecake for dessert, it was good but I think if we went back we'd try the hot chocolate cake.  Fun lively atmosphere, open feel and comfortable booths.

So too were the steamed mussels and chorizo, make sure you get some bread to with it and soak up the broth!  The wine list was simple and straight forward, the selections good.        The staff was a crack squad, perhaps a little over attentive, but that's honestly not a bad thing.  The manager, Ashley, came by and offered suggestions and was wonderfully helpful.

    "text": "We decided to try out The Arrogant Butcher last night for my husband's birthday. Unfortunately we made the decision last minute and couldn't make a reservation.  If it hadn't been for the Josh Groban concert I'm sure we wouldn't have waited an hour for table.    However, even though we waited for an hour for a table, the food and service were pretty good. I would give the food 5 stars, the service 4 and the atmosphere 4.    We were worried the portion sizes would be small based on some reviews/pictures here, but we did not find that to be the case. We ended up taken half our food home because we couldn't finish it.    We ordered the soft pretzels with provolone dipping sauce, jambalaya and the beef short rib stew.  All three were EXCELLENT.  The kitchen/our server didn't get the soft pretzels out to us until after we were served our entrees but they were so good it didn't matter.  Our food was out less than 15 minutes after ordering.  The cornbread that came with the stew was amazing.  It was filled with corn and green chilies. It was a very sweet and savory corn bread and it was divine.    We don't drink, but it seemed like people were enjoying their drinks. The bar was packed and overflowing.    We will definitely be back - there are quite a few things I wouldn't mind trying including the desserts - warm peanut butter cup with chocolate gelato? Yes, please. We would have ordered it last night but we were so full we couldn't fathom eating another bite.  My advice - Make a reservation.  The food is worth it.",

There was a large selection of food from oysters on the half shell to artisan cheeses to fish and chips to steak to popcorn shrimp.  With such lack of culinary focus one might think mediocrity would come with every dish, but I happily report not.  We had oysters, skirt steak, bread and roasted vegetables, and some small assorted plates.  Everything was fantastic.  The combination of urban patio, eclectic menu, and great service make for a fun meal.  The one complaint I have is the price.  It's quality food but I did feel a little taken.  For instance, a draft beer was nearly $6 (I see it as an index since beer, even when hand crafted, is like the cheapest stuff on earth).  Anyway, it loses one star for the gouge but people with deeper pockets and looser fingers may add the star back.",

I ordered a BLT sandwich for entree. It was approximately  $11 (a bit pricy but my boss is paying hehe). I love how sweet the bun was and the portion was more than enough to get me full. However, the bacon was a bit overcooked for my taste. The order also comes with a side of your choice. I ordered the French fries and loved it. All of my co-workers seem to enjoy their food.   I will definitely come back here again for lunch. It is a bit pricy but no matter for good food and services. My only complaint is how tight the tables are from each other.

    "text": "Really delicious menu. My three highlights and two areas for improvement are below.   1. THE PRETZEL BITES WITH PROVOLONE FONDUE. there's really nothing else to say. Do it.  2. The loaded nachos were really loaded. There is delicious guacamole, beans, a scrumptious cheese sauce, and much more. We licked this plate clean!  3. The seating- there is a cool room in the back corner, a large square bar surrounded by tvs on each side. Also had community tables where 12 people can sit, first come, first serve. This is my favorite type of seating and it was great!  The rest of the food was also salivating (shout out to the tacos). But two things keep this place from being a five star rating. First, it's a bit pricey. Food was good, but each entree item was over $20 (except for the fish tacos. Hence why I got them). Second, the special margarita was very sugary and did not have much alcohol. I'm not the biggest fan of spending $11 for juice.",

Also got the scallops for the entree, they were fresh and good for light dinner, the corn/cheese mash that they were sitting on was a little salty/strong for the delicate taste of scallops. And the dessert was really good - warm peanut butter cup, basically a peanut butter sauce with a scoop of gelato served with 2 peanut butter cookies.   Overall my husband and I weren't blown away by the entrees, but I think the apps, charcuterie, cocktails, and dessert are worth going back for.",

Service was excellent; our waiter/server was amazing and very knowledgeable about the menu and the wine selections. They made special accommodations for us to adjust the appetizer we wanted to accommodate our dietary restrictions and we were not disappointed. The beef spare rib stew was delicious and all the other selections were equally satisfying; even my very picky daughter finished her entree. Altogether one of the best culinary experiences I've had in a long time. Kudos!! Would definitely recommend and visit again when in Phoenix.",

They have a nice cocktail menu and the drinks came out fast. We shared the butchers platter and it was truly yummy. Apart from Postino's, probably my next fave in the area. Salami's, prosciutto, cheeses, olives, chutney- it had it all and was the perfect thing to pick at while conversing and enjoying some drinks. If you sit on the patio or at the window, there is some great people watching opportunities too, since you are in the heart of downtown.  My only criticism is how packed it got the evening we were there. It got really difficult to order a drink at the bar and there didn't seem to be any system to make it any easier for the customers. This wasn't the case when we were here at lunch time, but when we got back around 10pm. I would just take heed of that advice if some large event is happening downtown when you visit.",

It had okay food and service, and the atmosphere was pretty nice for a relaxed business meeting. Elements of our experience, however, were very strange.    We stared with cocktails & oysters, which were great.  When it came time for entrees, things got weird.  The waitress kept telling us the dishes we were considering when ordering were \"mediocre\", or \"not the best I've had\", or \"only okay\".    Our meals- the salmon, the scallops, and a kale salad with chicken- turned out okay, but the overall experience left something to be desired. I don't think I'll go back, especially considering the large number of great restaurants from which to choose in the area!",

    "text": "So disappointed in my last visit.  I make it a point to stop in to this place every time I am in Phoenix on business because I love the food and the vibe of the place.  This last time I was in town I had to bring my wife for the first time and she was excited to go based on how much I talked about the place.  We had a reservation on a Sunday night a few weeks ago.  Despite the place being half empty, we were originally sat in the very far dark corner where the only people sitting near us had a small child that was screaming its head off.  Not the best setting for a date, so we requested to be resat outside.  Our waiter greeted us and was very friendly.  He took our drink order and a few minutes later returned with my drink, but not the wine my wife ordered, and said he would be right back.  We didn't see him again for another 15 minutes when he finally brought the wine.  He apologized and took our appetizer order, which was oysters, and our main course order.  We don't dig cocktail sauce so I requested one of their three other sauce choices at the time we ordered.  I appetizer was brought out by another server shortly after with, you guessed it, only cocktail sauce.  We let the oysters sit there and waited for him to return so we could get what we ordered.  After another 15 minutes, another server noticed we weren't eating and asked what we needed.  He informed us that the kitchen was out of the other sauce we wanted.  Our food came, by way of yet another server, and we ate.  Our original server never came by, never refilled our drinks, and in fact we did not see him again until we asked another server to bring our bill and then he magically appeared....apologized....and tried to kiss our butts.  Long story short, although the food was good, I was completely embarrassed that I took my wife to a place I held in such high regard only to have the worst service I have had in a very long time.  I will not frequent this place again if I get the same horrible service.  Time to look for a new hangout in Phoenix.",

She apologized for not realizing that I was waiting to be seated (how she didn't realize that is unknown to be since she was the hostess). She told me that there was a fifteen minute wait unless I wanted to set at the bar. I seated myself at the bar, and the bartender ended asked if I had been here before and of course I said that I have not. She brought over the menu, and left. Waiting, waiting, and more waiting. I thought well maybe she  doesn't realize I'm done looking  at the menu. Literally I started me stop watch 8 minutes and 53 seconds go by before she comes back, and the almost 9 minute wait before I actually turned on the stop watch who knows before then how long it actually was long enough to actually started timing.

It wasn't very spicy, and just tasted 'flat', not much going on. Next time if I'm in Phoenix again, I'll go for a steak and re-review, but if they specialize in steaks then maybe they shouldn't be fiddling with other foods they don't know how to do as well. I also think that for the quality, it was overpriced. I will say that our waitress was very kind and the wine was good. :)",

    "text": "I've been here a couple times, and while I like the general atmosphere, the food and service have been hit or miss. The Arrogant Butcher has a snazzy name and an equally snazzy downtown location, and there's always a bit of a wait to get seated. I've noticed that the dining room isn't ever completely full, so the wait must be due to a mismatch between space and servers.   On my first visit, I came with a group of friends and we were seated outside. The service was superb, and our waiter was even nice enough to offer to roll down the plastic shade on the outside so the sunlight wouldn't be in our eyes. On my second visit, the service was lackluster and dismissive, to the point of being negligent. There was also a huge hair ball floating around the floor area I was sitting, which wasn't a pleasant sight during dining (I did think it was slightly funny that our waitress nonchalantly stepped over it multiple times).  Fish and chips: The first time I had this dish, I was blown away by the light crispiness of the fish and the freshness of the fries. The portion was generous, and I was so excited to try it again the second time. When I did recommend that my friend order this the second time and we shared, I found the fish to be super oily and the coating to be too thick. The fries were also limp and borderline cold.   Beef stew with cornbread: This stew was homey and comforting, especially when paired with the cornbread. The cornbread was lukewarm though, and that put a bit of a damper on the pairing. The seasoning is also on the spicy side, but the cornbread does a nice job of off-setting that.   Cheese ravioli: A pretty solid dish, but the portion is on the small side for the price. The ravioli was made well, and the sauce was nicely seasoned.   Turkey pastrami sandwich: I only had a bite of this on my first visit, but I thought the pastrami was pretty tasty. This is a hearty sandwich, and our server let us know that it was one of their most filling. Side salad can be substituted for the usual fries.  I may be back to the Arrogant Butcher, but the mixed experiences I've had make me a little wary.",

He was pleasant but probably a bit over seated with other customers. Overall a great atmosphere and ambiance with great food.",

The atmosphere of the restaurant is wonderful with very comfy booths and nice bar seating. The lighting is mid level, which I prefer so it wasn't straining. The music was on the louder side but still possible for a conversation without hearing the people around you.   A previous yelper said they would die for the pretzels and fondue but it was just a normal dish for me, it definitely didn't stand out (and same with Culinary Dropout, that has the same dish). I'm just waiting for a restaurant to have a fondue that is spicy or just something different.   We both got the normal burgers, which were nicely balanced with toppings but not too big. The bun was really good also. My favorite thing was that I didn't finish my burger and I had it the next day and it was just as good. Their fries are done really well.",

Other staff I interacted with seemed ok but this was a total turn off.   For the food on happy hour, Nachos were by far the best topped with delicious white cheddar and flavorful carnitas. The buffalo wings were also pretty good, but I wasn't expecting them to be boneless and I think that deducted from the flavor. For beverages, definitely would recommend the $5 mule on happy hour.   Overall, I'd love to consider this place again to try more of the menu considering it's proximity to Talking Stick, but that service will make me think twice.",

One friend ordered the beef stew which was what I was going to order. Had a little bit of a kick to it so I'm glad I didn't order it (I'm a wimp to anything spicy). My other friend ordered the vegetarian enchiladas. They looked good but I didn't try it. I don't think I heard her talk one bit when her food came. She loved it. I ordered the meat loaf. I never order meat loaf lol and I am glad I did. It was delicious and the kale side was a great add on. The only complaint I have was it was too big. I had to miss making lunch for the next day for work . I enjoyed the atmosphere and the server was very helpful when we ordered with all our questions. Great place and I'll definitely be back!",

I was torn about even coming here, but seeing as I really like North which is another one of their restaurants I decided to give it a shot.  I ordered the \"pink drink\" which is their version of a Cosmo and it's really good. For a starter I had the crispy shrimp, which was essentially just fried shrimp that comes with a spicy aioli. The sauce is good but the shrimp is nothing to write home about. For my main I asked the server which would be a better choice between the fish and chips or the crab stuffed chicken, he advised that the fish and chips was the better choice. Boy was I disappointed, the batter was so thick and greasy it was disgusting and the fries weren't anything to talk about  either.  I will give this place a solid review for service and ambiance but the food I had was nothing special. Which is actually kind of sad because like I mentioned previously, I love north!",

The cocktails were excellent with great flavors and a heavy pour but not too over powering. I had the scallops which were on the smaller side a little over cooked but good flavors made up for that. My wife got the salmon which was cooked perfectly and the rainbow beets that came with them were wonderful. She found the pesto to be too over powering in the quinoa. The appetizer of shrimp was another highlight as was the desert of sticky toffee pudding. Enjoyed it enough looking forward to trying more of there menu when we have more time rather than being on a time line for the show.",

    "text": "The Arrogant Butcher is a gastropub restaurant in Downtown Phoenix.  It's within walking distance to the theater and sports arena.  Parking is available in the nearby parking structure.  It's $10 but you can get it validated.  We were in town for the weekend and needed to find a place to have dinner.  This spot caught my attention with the catchy name.    We came here on a busy Friday night at 8pm.  Everyone was out and about dining and grabbing a drink to unwind. Luckily it was a 30 minute wait since we chose outdoor seating.  It was nice because the weather was warm and breezy.  The hostess was nice.  Our server was very friendly and accommodating.  She checked on us throughout the meal.   It was a no meat Friday so our options were limited.  We ordered the raw oysters on a half shell. Not the freshest but you can't complain since it's AZ.  We are spoiled because of being in a coastal state.  Seafood is much better.   For our entrees, we had the almond crusted rainbow trout.  It was ok served with sauteed green beans, potato puree and brown butter.  The grilled salmon is the better choice.  Smoky flavor and flaky texture.  I prefer this over the trout.  Also served with the same sides.   The seafood is just average.  I want to come back to try the meat entrees.  Especially the crab stuffed chicken and Jambalaya.  On our next trip, we will definitely visit this restaurant again.",

    "text": "We came on a Saturday evening at around 6:30pm and had to wait about 20 minutes for a party of two.  This place is really interesting because it seems like there are different portions of the restaurant that try to give off different atmospheres. There's a bar in the front that has modern decor. We ate in an area that seemed to represent a diner from the 1950s and had an open kitchen. There's an area in the bad that seemed to have a lot of bigger tables for larger parties and had a lot of portraits of baseball players. It seems like you can have a different experience depending on what you go there for.  CHEESE RAVIOLI ($15) - This dish just didn't have the cheese flavors I was expecting in a cheese ravioli dish. There wasn't much of it and the ravioli itself didn't have much flavor. My girlfriend ordered the rainbow trout and she mentioned the same thing about the fish not having much flavor. The pine nuts gave it the crunchiness and the spinach gave the dish much needed saltiness. I was just not the biggest fan and the garlic bread was okay. 2.5/5  SALTED CARAMEL PUDDING ($7) - We had heard a lot of Yelp reviews mention this so we hoped it would make up for the entrees. It was what its name says: salty and caramel-flavored. The whipped cream added a nice sweetness to it. It was probably the best thing we ate here. 4/5  We really wanted to like the food here but we just couldn't get ourselves to like what we ordered.",

The bar has amazing options too, and it is so close to city scape that it's right within walking distance of so many big places. There is a super nice patio outside where you can get in some good people watching, but remember that you're in downtown Phoenix so it's not out of the norm to be approached on the patio by random homeless people from the area. Luckily, they are pretty harmless if you treat them with respect.   I will say that the menu is too small for my liking, which makes it a little difficult to eat here if you have a picky eater with you. You probably have a selection of about 10-15 dishes and a few salads. While the variety of the options is great, there's just not MANY of options.   I've always had superb service here-for both lunch and dinner. I find myself to keep going back, which means it must be worth it!",

Since we had a reservation, we didn't have to wait but a few minutes while they got our table ready. The first thing I saw was a huge bar, equipped with a few TV screens for sports fans. They have lots of seating, goes all the way to the back. The booth seating at the back was larger than the typical four-people booth, it can comfortably seat up to six people.  We started off with a couple of appetizer to share; Crispy Shrimp and Spinach & Artichoke Dip. The Crispy Shrimp was was very tasty and addicting. The portion was a bit small, especially considering the price tag. The dip was pretty good too, and the chips were tasty!   For main, I went with Diver Scallops.  It was well made, high quality and I enjoyed every bite.   At the end, we decided to share one dessert. Our server told us that their desserts are easy to share, and most of them (maybe all of them?) come in a bowl or some kind of container. We went with Warm Peanut Butter Cup. When it arrived, I was surprised by the way it looked. It was whipped dessert, more creamy than mousse. Very peanut butter-y.   Our server, Logan was quite awesome. He was friendly and very informative, made us feel welcomed with a big smile. The service overall was very nice, all the staffs were polite and took good care of us. We had a nice dinner here, the price tag might be a bit high based on what you order, but the quality was also high. Definitely a great spot to get together with friends and family, or for a business dinner. Reservation is recommended with its popularity.",

Waiter recommended the perfect beer for each of our tastes and was very friendly but not overboard. Definitely a place during the week where lots of convention goers go and it started to crowd up after 6, which would become a fun place to hang for the evening if you're staying in town.",

He made great suggestions and was amazing at his job.  Order the Charcuterie platter.  It featured a great mix of their specialties.  The green goddess ceasar was to die for as were the fish n chips.  Treat yo' self and dine at the Arrogant Butcher.",

We walked in and we were immediately greeted by the hostess. I had changed my reservation, but they were quick to accommodate. We opted for indoor seating since it was still warm out. I think I would have enjoyed indoor seating anyways since the ambiance was nicer with the bar area and the nice indoor seating decor. The patio is great for people watching, but it was dead on a weeknight.  We ordered the beef short rib stew ($18) and the bbq baby back ribs ($24). Between the 2, I really liked the stew better. We asked for our egg to be over easy so that the yolk can drip into the stew. It was rich but delicious. The ribs were OK. Not much meat on the bones and I had to request more sauce (I like a lot of sauce with my ribs). The extra sauce doesn't come out warm, so you may want to ask for your sauce to be warmed up.  We had good service and had a great time at this happening restaurant.",

We arrived at 12:05 and the restaurant was almost completely empty. A HUGE crowd from the convention center arrived around the same time. Some of the convention folks had reservations for 12:00 and were promptly seated - totally fine. We (toward the front of the crowd) were told to wait until closer to our reservation, which was okay, since we were a few minutes early.   As we sat off to the side, the host staff seated multiple large parties without reservations and the restaurant quickly became very full. Around 12:13, after the crowd died down, a member of our group asked if we could be seated yet. The hostess rudely told her we needed to continue waiting until closer to our reservation time, to ensure that we enjoyed good service. Right before 12:15, the same woman walked over to seat our party, acting completely unaware that we were confused and unhappy. Our table had obviously been sitting empty the entire time we waited in the entrance. After ordering, we got to sit around and watch everyone else in the restaurant get their food before us, even though we had arrived first, with a reservation.   Maybe I don't understand how restaurant seating works, but from a customer's point of view, it is very annoying to see multiple large parties without reservations be seated before your reservation will be accepted (and you're less than 10 minutes early). To us, it felt like the host staff was purposefully making us wait, to spite us. If that was not the case, they could have kindly explained their protocol.   These interactions definitely soured our experience. The food tasted fine, but we won't be back.",

We started with the Butcher's Board and ended with the Peanut Butter dessert. Both excellent. My daughter had the fish tacos and said they were the best she ever had.

The service and food started out great, but it all fell apart when it came to the entrees. They did adjust the bill, but the way they handled the situation was very poor.  We started with an Antipasti appetizer consisting of two cheeses, one meat and marinated olives. The waiter assisted with our selections and it along with our drink order came promptly. The appetizer was delicious.  When the entrees came my partner's steak, which was ordered medium well, was burnt to a crisp. The server even asked him what he thought of it and said they already had another steak cooking for hm since this one looked overcooked.   Why bother bringing food to the table that you know isn't right? Now I had my dinner and while he technically had food he was waiting for the replacement. At his suggestion I ate my dinner and of course finished before he received his.   The biggest issue was the overcooked steak. A couple small things were the side of grilled asparagus I ordered came chilled. I asked and that's the way they prepare it. Grill it, then chill it. That should have been disclosed as I've never heard of that type of preparation before. My glass of wine I ordered \"with dinner\" came half way through my meal. Again, poorly executed.  We still had a nice evening despite the missteps by the restaurant.",

I would give the food a 4.5.  We ordered drinks, and the server tries to get our food order. Decided on starters, and let the server know that we hadn't decided on entrees yet. Drinks come, and while waiting for the apps to come the server asks if we've figured out the entrees yet. Not yet - sorry - plus I'd like to see the size of the appetizer before deciding between something lighter like the ramen or something hefty like the sandwich.  Appetizers come - and right away before even the chance to put a bite in our mouths, the server comes up and says \"You aren't even going to order entrees, are you\".   Ummm - well, first of all, yes, we are, and secondly, I'd like to get at least 2 drinks during the meal - isn't it better for the restaurant? Better for the server? We ordered entrees, only had time for 1 drink, ate, and left.  The place wasn't even crowded - no need to turn the tables or anything like that.",

Because I wasn't that hungry I only ordered a soup and when it arrived it was luke warm at best. My husband ordered a beer which we had to remind them twice about before it arrived. The staff were friendly and despite this I would probably go there again and hope that our experience was just a one off.",

    "text": "Yep, it's good.   A restaurant doesn't get 4 stars out of 500+ reviews for nothing.   Went here with coworkers after a long, hard day of standing around looking busy at the Travel Goods Association International Luggage Show at the Phoenix convention center. Tired of candy, pretzels and food court food we decided to venture out into the night on foot to the Arrogant Butcher. I called ahead and easily made a reservation for 5 people. We walked to the restaurant from the Hyatt across the street from the Convention Center and it took us probably 7 minutes to get there. Easy walk, and thankfully not a bad part of town (although they sure do roll the sidewalks up early in Downtown Phoenix, it was pretty dead and it was only 7:30).  When we arrived, we were greeted and immediately seated. The decor is casual, but not too casual that you wouldn't consider having a business lunch or dinner there. We ordered the Black Mussels as an appetizer, they were very good. The spicy salumi and tomato broth was flavorful and rich. I only wish they had served the Mussels with a little more bread. When there's a good broth it's such a shame to not have bread to dip in it.   I also had the \"Gin and Sexy Tonic\", which was yummy. Nothing remarkable, but I've literally never met a G&T I didn't like so I have no complaints about the drink at all.   A coworker and I were each torn between the same two dishes, so we decided each to order one and share them. She ordered the New York Strip and I ordered the Scallops. Both we fantastic. The scallops were cooked perfectly and served with the tastiest roasted cauliflower and Brussels sprouts and some kind of puree that I can't remember, and garnished with slices of tangerine.   The New York Strip was wonderfully tender and cooked to medium rare, like my coworker ordered. It was served pre-sliced, which made it very conducive for sharing, and I don't think any flavor or succulence was lost on account of the meat being pre-sliced. Unlike G&Ts, I HAVE met steaks I didn't like, but this steak was not one of them. I liked this steak a lot.   For dessert, we order one each of the Salted Caramel Pudding, the \"Hot Chocolate\" Cake and the Blueberry Cheesecake. They're served in little jars, which is cute.   Let me just say- that salted caramel pudding was DIVINE. Absolutely divine. Blessed and sanctified by the pudding gods, a holy union of sweet and savory in a little jar and, ultimately, in my mouth and in my tummy. Hallelujah.   Hot Chocolate Cake was good, but not extraordinary. I can make a very similar chocolate molten lava cake that's at least as good at home (let me know if y'all want the recipe, it's beyond easy and very impressive for dinner parties!), and I can make like a dozen of them for as much as it cost us to order this one cake. But I digress. If you're a chocolate lover there's nothing wrong with this cake and it will satisfy your chocolate tooth.   Blueberry Cheesecake-- I have to say I was disappointed. The kind of cheesecake I like is the thick, dense, heavy \"I might just be eating a block of cream cheese\" kind, and this cheesecake did not deliver in that respect. It was one of those whipped cheesecakes, more like a mousse than a cheesecake really, so I took one bite and lost interest and went back to the holiest of holy Salted Caramel Pudding.   All told (and by this I mean including tax and tip and everything), the bill worked out to about $200 for one appetizer, 2 drinks, 5 entrees and 3 desserts. Not bad, really, considering that the food was high quality, heftily apportioned and very tasty.   The verdict: The Arrogant Butcher is a great place to go and grab some dinner, be it with friends or colleagues, if you're willing to spend a little extra dough to make it a memorable and delectable meal.   To Go or Not to Go:  Get your butt over there if you're in the area and thank me later.",

    "text": "We had just arrived in Phoenix and wondered down to the Chase Field area to see what was going on, and decided to catch a bite to eat.  As we wondered looking for something a bit more upscale we ran across the Arrogant Butcher.  The staff were very attentive and offered a number of great suggestions.  Not knowing what some of the items were our waiter made some suggestions, and then said that if we didn't see something that caught our eye to let him know and he would have the kitchen pull it together for us.  Are you kidding me?  We started with a nice cold craft beer that I was unfamiliar with, and the reason I selected it was based on a suggestion from the waiter, plus a pre-sample.  Nice touch.  We were looking for something light so we decided to go with one of their signature salads since I wasn't up to a full meal.  Our waiter asked what I was in the mood for and I said salmon.  No problem, a nice piece of blackened salmon was added to the salad.  Now that is what I call service.  The salad was excellent and the blackened salmon was cooked just right.  The other menu items looked quite good and I'm sure we'll be back for something more formal at a later date.",

The pretzels were also okay .. a little dry. For dinner we ordered the fish & chips and another dish that I can't remember the name of - both were not too bad ... We had a lot of leftovers. I had heard a lot about the salted caramel pudding so even tho we were really full from dinner, we ended up getting that. I would say that this was the best part of the entire meal.

We started with the simple chopped salad, it was for one person but the champagne dressing was so yummy. We had salmon and the crab stuffed chicken. The salmon was delicious and we would order again. The crab stuffed chicken was good, but not sure I would order it again. Think I'm going to try the sweet potato tortellini next time. We didn't order them, but the nachos looked amazing!!!

CONS: In some aspects might be perceived too \"formula\", as a dining factory.  4-AMBIANCE: A large open dining room with a hip urban vibe, high ceilings and a variety of comfortable seating options; good lighting and acoustic levels. 3-SERVICE: Proficient, attentive and no-nonsense but with the feeling that both maximizing the tab as well as achieving a quick table turn are priorities. 3-FOOD: Generously portioned appetizers of tasty fried shrimp with spicy aioli and pretzel buns with provolone fondue were easy, and more then adequate, for the entire table to share; the good sized cut of roast prime rib (Saturday night special), served with horseradish and excellent truly decadent Dauphinoise potatoes, was disappointingly chewy; BBQ baby back ribs offered with coleslaw and well prepared fries were well flavored but some might wish they were more \"fall off the bone\". 4-VALUE: A broad range of menu options presented at reasonable costs, especially in consideration of consistently generously sized portions results in outstanding values; one could easily eat from just the appetizer/charcuterie or salad/soup menus and still be fully satisfied. 4-OVERALL: A quality dining experience for and within reach of the masses.  WHAT WE ATE: Crispy Shrimp; Pretzel Fondue; Prime Rib; BBQ Ribs.  WHAT WE WISH WE ATE THAT WE DIDN'T: Smoked carnitas nachos; smoked salmon rillette; beef short rib stew; king crab cioppino; chicken pot pie.",

    "text": "After a \"rigorous\" evening of flow yoga at Lustre Bar upstairs, my friends and I were hungry and found ourselves at The Arrogant Butcher. I've always wanted to try this place and despite my friends wanting to get \"salads\" and the title of the restaurant didn't really yell salads, I made them come here and I was extremely glad I did!  I learned several things that evening!  1. Order the Candlestick Maker. (Well, if you're a bourbon fan like me!) It has Makers 46, lemon, Thatcher's Spiced Apple, honey and angostura  2. Order the Old Fashioned. (They do it right here!)  3. Share the Penn Cove Mussels with a friend -  Spicy Salumi, Charred Tomato,   Grilled Bread  4. Enjoy the house soft pretzels with provolone fondue. - You may also want to share this one, but who knows, maybe you're extra hungry with those cocktails and want something to \"absorb\" the potency of those cocktails.   We enjoyed ourselves so much here that we were there past when the kitchen closed. To my dismay, I didn't know that the kitchen closed at 9pm, and my husband, who was at home, wanted something to eat. When the waiter informed me the kitchen closed, I shamefully whined, \"Wait! I was supposed to bring home something for my husband! You can't let me go home empty handed. He'd be so angry with me.\" The waiter then asked me if I knew what I wanted to order to go. I said, \"The short rib stew!\" He answered, \"Well let me see what we can do..\" He then proceeded to head to the kitchen. My anxiety reached all new heights as I awaited his response. It wasn't long before he returned and said, \"We still have some stew, which means, yes, you can still get it to go!\" I was so elated! I loudly exclaimed, \"You and the kitchen just made my night!!!\" I love how accommodating they were there! This is a great example of how great their service is!!  5. So the whole point of this story above is... Spectacular food (at least the stuff I tried that night), stupendous service, and too cool to be kitsch decor yet almost farm like and trendy. I will always recommend and return to this place again, because I love them!",

I had the slow roasted prime rib plate for my entree, and it was cooked to perfection.  All in all a good experience.  My only disappointment was while parking in the garage nowhere did it state you should bring your ticket into the restaurant to have it validated to avoid paying parking.  Upon reaching the exit, the gentleman quoted $16.  I stated I had just finished eating at \"The Arrogant Butcher\", and I had my receipt to prove it.  He stated he couldn't use the receipt and I would have to go back to get the ticket stamped to avoid the charge.  That was easier said then done; there vehicles behind me.

We were out for lunch and decided to give this a try. Server recommended it for dinner for next time.   Flavors were pretty good  - Jambalaya was an enjoyable spice. (Good kick) I usually don't eat foods with okra, green onion, or bell peppers but overall altogether it tasted great (Good flavors) - The Turkey Pastrami burger had a variety of flavors and a good meat choice! In my opinion, the coleslaw inside the burger was a downside of the burger; yet overall, would recommend!",

    "text": "I ordered take out at around 630PM on a Tuesday. Take out only took 15 minutes. I walked in, was greeted swiftly by the hostess, went to the bar to pay for my order, and then walked safely back to my hotel--food in hand. I had ordered the beef short rib stew, which was neatly packed in a disposable container alongside a separate container for the cornbread. Nestled in the bag was also a package of disposable silverware.   1) I began with the stew: floating on top of the stew was the cooked egg. I decided not to eat this little dude separately so I mixed it up in the stew and ate it. Both the taste & aftertaste were rich in flavor & spicy--my lips are still pleasantly tingling from the spiciness. The consistency was also excellent: not too thick/thin (each bite was adequately contained on the spoon, without any dribbling). The ratio of meat to non-meat ingredients was adequate, too. I truly did not feel like I got ripped off for the price.   2) I then ate the cornbread: the immediate taste didn't prove much to me. But, after oh ~5seconds the flavor did kick in, and it was suave. I often ignore breads due to it being more or a hassle to chew & swallow which poses more of a health hazard than a pleasure to consume. This bread, however, was definitely in the latter category. Idk how to describe foods well, but it was rich, suave (again), perfectly buttery, and easily disintegrated in my mouth.   There was nothing else in the bag, which was expected.   Overall: yummy, and I would eat there again and get the same thing over again. My belly feels warm, and on a cold wintery night, this would definitely warm your belly & maybe even your heart a little. I'll attach a picture of the food, but it was s/p eating (bc it was yummy).",

First, he had the personality of a claim.  Didn't smile, was unfriendly & slow.  Put the worst part was when the bill came, I put down the gift card (for $100 & our bill was $106) PLUS a $50 bill.  He came back and gave me $6 change.  As he turned to walk away, I said \"excuse me\" - he started to walk away.  Second time was louder - he kept walking and got a big grin on his face.  Third time I said it loud enough that people 3 tables away looked over - he stopped, turned, laughed and said \"Oh, I gave you the wrong change.\"  We were positive he knew what he was doing.  Asked for a manger on the way out and was told they was unavailable.",

We were seated in a booth and it wasn't too packed as the game finished late. But the space is definitely big enough to handle the pre and post event rushes.  The menu covers a wide spectrum with varying entrees and sandwiches to a raw bar and charcuterie. The bar menu is highlighted by specialty cocktails and a list of beers with a decent number of local brews. Whatever your purpose, whether it be to pass time, enjoy their happy hour, or have a sit down dinner, Arrogant Butcher probably has the food or drink you're looking for.  My wife had a burger and I had the chicken stroganoff along with a couple pints of 4 Peaks Kilt Lifter. Both dishes were standard and there were no issues. Service was good as it could be for how busy it was. The price for our food and drinks was a fair $42 before tip.",

Slow cooked Prime Rib: a Saturday only nightly special was cooked medium rare at one inch thickness and a deep dark pink with the most delicious side of horseradish dauphinois potatoes. Dauphinois is an origin of the French in what you may be  more familiar with the potato gratin. It's basically layered sliced potatoes with creme fresche and cheese with a bit of garlic and scallions. A version of a Julia Child type of dish. In Arrogant Butchers version I didn't really taste he horseradish which would have paired a little bit better with the prime rib. But either way it was quite exquisite and could eat a bowl full of it. $32  Grilled fish tacos:  was nothing but ordinary to me. It's made of grilled white fish, tomatillo sauce, avocado, pico de gallo and a side of white bean concoction. Still good but I could get the same elsewhere for a lot less. $17  Took a fellow Yelpers advice and parked in the Cityscape Parking garage and validated our ticket before seating. Otherwise it's $3 per hour.   All in all AB would be a swanky place for the meat lovers and a FC restaurant lover in downtown Phoenix.",

Get it...and pour it on everything...even if it's not food. Pouring this cheese on it makes it food...savory, delicious food.  I digress...Happy Hour was great and very inexpensive for what you would expect in a downtown location. $5 spirits (and other deals-see pics) from 3-6.  Service was very good as well. We ended up having two servers: one from the patio and the bartender when we moved inside. Both friendly and attentive. WARNING: Bees will want your fancy alcoholic beverages...they will stalk you!   Overall, it was a very good experience and we would return for the Happy Hour and cheese...or maybe just cheese. We will see!",

The place was hard to find and difficult to get to due to the construction around, but I wouldn't fault the restaurant for this.

Came here with a few coworkers after a business meeting.   We ordered: - Crispy shrimp  - Crab stuffed chicken - Fish n chips - Jambalaya  - Paloma - Beer  We shared the crispy shrimp for appetizer. We had the other items for our entrees so I can't speak for how their food was. The shrimp was good, nice texture. Kind of like popcorn shrimp but less breading.  The crab stuffed shrimp was okay, not anything amazing. I thought it was really greasy since it was breaded and fried. The mashed potatoes were bland and too creamy. I like a little texture in my potatoes, makes it feel more real (if that makes sense).  The Paloma was okay, it was very light on the alcohol, but it tasted strongly of alcohol. I don't mind my drink tasting like alcohol if it does the trick, but this drink unfortunately did not.  Anyway, my visit here was average. Probably wouldn't come back.  It was super busy though for a Tuesday evening. We made a reservation through open table and were seated right away. We saw a few groups waiting when we arrived. Reservations are the way to go!",

Our waiter was terrific and attentive, all of the staff was dressed festive (I loved this!) the ambiance was on point, while we did have reservations, it seemed that others were willing to wait it out, they were busy!

My friend ordered the loaded baked potato as her side. We both ordered our prime rib medium, however upon delivery, they were both on the side of medium rare. The flavor was really good though and boy the mac & cheese did not disappoint. The loaded baked potato was fabulous too.

I ordered the fish and chips. Nice golden brown fish. The fries were a little over cooked. The plate itself was not worth the cost. Some of the other dishes were worth it but $18 for average tasting fish and chips, no. After the main meal a few of us chose to try dinne dessert and coffee.

Maybe the food production was slow and this is something that management needs to fix.   Anyways, I ordered the buffalo chicken sandwich with fries. Their fries are crispy and delectable. Amazing seasoning and crispiness to the fries. The buffalo chicken sandwich came with breaded chicken drizzled with buffalo sauce, lettuce, onion, and tomatoes on a pretzel-ish looking bun. However, although the chicken was flavorful, the bread was quite dry, hard, and slightly burnt. I would probably come back here but try something else.",

    "text": "I am giving them one star because my friends enjoyed their meals; I just didn't and as you read, gross right?! I ordered the Clam Chowder which was their soup special for the day and the Crispy Shrimp with the Shashito Pepper and Spicy Aiola Sauce. I'm familiar with a lot of clam chowders because I've been to the East Coast, West Coast, East Coast, West Coast...you get the picture. I don't think I've ever had one that had bacon in it. I ordered it because it was the Soup of the Day; unknowingly it had bacon in it. I took one big bite of it and could just taste Smoky bacon in it. Now some of you guys love that, and I don't have a problem with it but I haven't had pork for over 23 years. I now get to adjust that to tomorrow being day One that I haven't had pork. Usually, if there's a special ingredient in it your menu item, it's something special you just don't give it the name Clam Chowder and assume people are going to know that you put bacon in it (or other unusual ingredient). A little pissed about it, but I let it go because it was maybe it was a bit my fault, I should have asked what was in it. I will forever know not assume clam chowder is all fish and I will ask what the ingredients are because apparently bacon is a clam chowder ingredient, rather than a topping you choose or add to it -sarcasm  Now for my second item, the Crispy Shrimp.  I enjoyed it until It came upon a shrimp (look at the picture) that had its poop vein still intact. When you see that, it kind of turns you off of the dish. So, all-in-all for me the experience was horrible not something I enjoyed.  If I was a waiter and I saw a piece of shrimp laying on the table,  not bitten into, I would've asked, \"Was there a problem with the shrimp?\" I then  could have showed them the very visible poop vein. I didn't do that nor do I whine about anything else, I just paid my bill. I don't like to make fusses at restaurants but I would assume anybody else who's a good waiter or waitress would, one apologize for the soup having an ingredient that's not in it usually, for a fly in my water and for a icky shrimp dish that had a poop vein left intact. You normally don't see that at restaurants that are little more high-end. Not that this is a high-end restaurant but I think it touts self as that. I was very disappointed especially since I really didn't get the interaction from the wait staff for somebody that had one eating something unusual and then second, left a piece of shrimp visibly at the table with a poop vein. It wasn't like it wasn't obvious what it was - an obvious poop vein was still intact.  Now finally, and I find this completely crazy to me, my coworkers that were with me had to grab my glass from me because I was about to drink out of it and it had a fly in it. A fly...in my drink...and to tell you the truth, I don't remember if I had taken a sip before they noticed it. I pointed out the waitress, they just went and got me another drink. Had I known the disasters would continue with this meal, I would have taken a picture of it so I can post it here but I didn't.  I guess I thought there would be no more disasters and as you can see from above, it just continued. By the way, we were not seated outside.  One thing wrong, okay but to have three things wrong and not be at least approached by a manager shows poor waitstaff. I always give them 15% no matter what, I used to wait when I was in grad school and I never want to not at least leave 15%. It's an OCD of mine and I shouldn't have given them s*** but I couldn't stop myself. I just don't think it's right for my waiter to pay for my taxes on my meal.   The people with me enjoyed their food but I'm not going to comment on that, I don't think they deserve a review on those items because I don't think they deserve any accolades after having inadequate wait staff dealing with issues (or in this case, not dealing).  I don't eat pork or beef and haven't for over 23 years not for religious purposes but for personal reasons. Having said that, a wait staff should be telling people when there's an item inside a cooked dish that is not normally there. If nothing else, apologize and then also make sure you are cognizant of a visible piece of food laying on the table that has something wrong with it. Yes, it's my fault I should have brought it to their attention but when you're out with people you just don't like to make a fuss. Again though, I shouldn't have to make a fuss, it should have been taken care of. Bacon in soup, poop vein in shrimp and the piece de resistance, a fly in the water.   Yeah, not what I expected - pretty gross and pretty pathetic that a manager didn't at least get apprised of all the issues with my meal. One person should not have to experience all that kind of crap at a meal.",

The food was good, but I expected exceptional for the price they charge. My prime rib was a perfect rare, however the temperature of the prime rib and potato was a luke warm. If you like real horseradish with your steak, you will need to request raw horseradish as the creamy horseradish they serve with it is barely more than white sauce with no real flavor.",

We ordered the fritters and the pretzel bites for appetizers. Both were great. The pretzel bites and cheese are addictive.  As an entree I ordered the short rib stew, and attached a pic of it. The rib meat was tender and tasty, and it had just the right amount of heat from the green chilis. Amazing cornbread too. Others ordered the fish and chips, and the sloppy joe; all were happy with their orders.  I'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "I first came here on my birthday one year with my girlfriend. I'm pretty sure this place caught her interest because the name is really, really cool.  Arrogant Butcher is a 5 star restaurant because they are so well rounded. The service is impeccable. I've only had the pleasure of having 3 or 4 different entrees here, but they were truly mouth watering. You can tell that the menu was carefully crafted with influence from all around the world, however it is still a very 'Merican experience. The location is great, too. I would say that the crowd here is late 20's to early 50's, but it really depends on time of day. During game days, you'll get all types.  If you're in the Downtown Phoenix area, I strongly recommend coming here. On the nicer days of the year, it's is pretty cool to see both stadiums and several museums when you look out the windows or sit on the patio.  Two things: parking can get difficult, you will mostly likely have to pay for parking (lot or meter). Also, this place is pretty expensive--upwards of $20 a plate--be prepared for this when you're also ordering a bunch of drinks.",

    "text": "My one (and likely only) experience at The Arrogant Butcher was for happy hour, and it was one of the best mixes of food, drink, and value I have ever had. My friend and I were in town for a WWE event at the US Airways Arena, and decided to stop in here for food and drinks beforehand. We took a spot at the bar and was pleased to see a great selection of Happy Hour specials - both food and drink.  We ordered the house soft pretzels with cheese dip ($5) and the Antipasti plate ($8) to share, and each ordered one of their toasts ($4) - my friend went with the roasted peppers and boursin cheese, and I opted for the chicken liver pate. The soft pretzel order was HUGE - I've seen portions half the size for much more at brewpubs - and were DELICIOUS. The toasts were a nice surprise - ample portions, and great quality ingredients. The chicken liver pate was divine - so smooth and creamy. The Antipasti plate provided an ample portion of meats and cheeses, all great quality. At $11/person, we were happily stuffed with bar munchies of the highest caliber.  Beer selection here is limited, but they do offer some decent options. Guinness, Sierra Nevada Pale Ale, an IPA from Deschutes, and their local selection was the famous Four Peaks Kilt Lifter, that seemed to be everywhere I went in Phoenix. (They also had a Hefeweizen, but I don't remember where from.) At $3 for the local brew and $4 for the others, this is a great Happy Hour option.   I'd love to try them for dinner, but I can't imagine when/if I will be in Phoenix again. For happy hour, I give them my highest of recommendations.",

Even the marketing material promoting the place indicated it had some sort of sassy attitude, so I kind of expecting waiters doing a schtick or something, but disappointingly, they were pleasent, adequate waiters :(  Not having been to this restaurant before, I didn't know what to expect.  The interior is like a strange mash of sports bar and tacky bistro - only further confusing the identity of the establishment.    I'm typically a big fan of seafood, and the fish and chips were decent, but I was expecting a long list of butcher type items on the menu, not oyster shooters, and 3 types of fish.  Especially in downtown, middle of the freakin desert, Phoenix.    I'd suggest this place for a beer and an appetizer while sitting at the bar, not so much for a sit down dinner date.",

My friend Jose had the split Pea soup and said it was good, but to me it looked too much like soup and not a thick traditional style split pea so just be prepared for that. Since they make their own bread pretzel type rolls there some bread and butter to dip in to the soup would have been a brilliant idea.  The battered fish and chips (I assume it was beer battered cause it looked that way) looked awesome and I would probably try that next time.  The atmosphere is cool and fun.

I was initially very upset, because I made a reservation expecting to be seated at my desired time. The manager noticed and acknowledged my frustrations, and even the server that was going to take care of us came to apologize. Definitely WOWed by this gesture. When we were seated the manager made sure to cover our appetizers. My experience was turned around.   The food was very good. Most of the dishes are flavorful and hearty.  I personally got the Jambalaya rice, which was very tasty but very spicy. Make sure you pair it with the corn bread   Recommendations:  1. Butcher's Board - they even make sure to explain to you all the items  2. Nachos w/ Carnitas - very flavorful  3. Burger w/ Bacon",

We told the waitress and spoke to the manager, and instead of taking that dish off the bill entirely, they discounted our bill by $6.  The dish was $23, so that really did not remedy the situation.

Having never sat in the back room, I was pleasantly surprised at the wall art which consisted of vintage sports photos and eclectic items.  We started off with drinks including Bloody Mary's which were well-made and spicy. Next were the appetizers. We  ordered zucchini fritters, hummus, and 18 oysters. The zucchini fritters were light, airy and not oily. The hummus was good although it's hard to really mess up hummus. The oysters were very fresh, and interesting in that they were very small. The oysters cost $2.45 each.  For the main meal, I ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich on an onion roll. It had a wonderful coleslaw type of dressing and was joyful to eat. Others in our party ordered jambalaya, steak, chicken stroganoff, and fish and chips. We all tried each other's food and seem to agree that everything was excellent.    Although we were stuffed, we ordered the  chocolate peanut butter dessert. It was nothing like I have ever seen. It's consistency was almost like a thick soup. Extremely decadent, it really hit the spot. Definitely more than enough to share with two or three people.  Service was on point and our particular server was very patient with a party of nine which included four children.",

Whenever either one of us had an empty drink it was almost immediately offered a refill by another employee, regardless of if they were our server or not. Everyone working there genuinely wanted all customers to have a good experience even if they weren't getting tipped for their service. The pretzel rolls with provolone fondue were AMAZING! But super easy to fill up on (so hold off on eating too many). I had the king crab cioppino which was great and my boyfriend had the diver scallops. I give this place 4 stars instead of 5 because the scallops are seared brown on the tops of them on the diver scallop plate, which I don't personally care for, but everything else was great. I will be back again to try more of what they have to offer!",

We enjoyed the pretzels and the zucchini fritters for an appetizer. The pretzels and cheese fondue were awesome...like I could take a bath in that cheese sauce kind of good. The zucchini fritters were just ok and the dipping sauce tasted too much like tartar sauce so it wasn't my fav. I enjoyed the scallops while the rest of my companions has the jambalaya and the pork carnitas. All were really tasty. The scallops were perfectly done and a good size. We also enjoyed the peanut butter chocolate gelati for dessert. It was superb.   Service was very good and prompt. Our drinks were kept full and I love that. This will definitely be in my arsenal of places to go downtown when I head there for events, but definitely keep in mind--it's NOISY.",

Celebrating my daughters debut at Symphony Hall I made reservations for a party of 9 which included 3 under 14.   They were very accommodating, tho I was put on hold twice to make sure it was okay to take the 9 top reservation.  They didn't wait to have us all there before we were seated.  A plus as we had my 99 year old grandfather with us and also had to wait for my daughter to change and arrive.   The food was from good to stellar, as we all ordered very different things.  Well three of us ordered the chicken stroganoff, which sounded fantastic but seemed to be missing something.  Still quite edible.  We also had the beef stew (I don't know how good it was because my grandfather wouldn't share), meatloaf (delicious) the smashed potatoes and gravy were perfect. I had the scallops, which were exactly what I needed as they were light and complemented my Arrogant 75(s) perfectly. We ordered each of the desserts to taste them all.  The peanut butter mouse (aka melted peanut butter cup) went VERY well with the hot chocolate cake. I don't know how the blueberry cheesecake was as my grandfather, again, didn't share.  But the salted caramel pudding was hands down MY FAVORITE!!! I'd come back just for that. You know what else I'd come back for? The service!! Tony was amazing!!! I love to ask questions, and he never once hesitated. His recommendations were spot on. He listened and was so much fun.  I eat out for the total package and Tony was the the perfectly tied bow on top! Can NOT wait to come back.",

The atmosphere was hindered by the TVs everywhere, it was very bizarre to be sitting in a darker and personal restaurant and then have ESPN everywhere you looked.  The food we did have was quite good...the kale salad had delicious dressing. My zucchini fritters sat under the warmers (I could see them from where I was sitting) for nearly 10 minutes after our other food was brought to us before being brought over. The cheese was good, though the bartender didn't know much about it.  When we first sat down, she told us the kitchen was closed (at NINE?), but then checked with the kitchen and said they're still open. She remained unfriendly the entire time.  Very disappointing since this restaurant was recommended by hotel staff and a guest at the hotel who overheard. I've also visited other Fox restaurants in Denver and had wonderful experiences...not sure what went wrong with this one.",

I am sometimes underwhelmed by Fox Concept restaurants, so I went in with fairly low expectations which were thankfully exceeded.  The service was helpful and very friendly.  She was great at suggesting items and drinks, and steered me towards the AMAZING lemonade/vodka drink with fresh muddled raspberries.  It was refreshing and delicious - so fresh!  The crushed ice was a really nice touch.  My lunch was the chicken club sandwich with fries.  Wow! Delicious!  Chicken, ham, bacon... really great flavor, and the bread just put the dish over the top.  I also enjoyed sampling my friend's fondue with pretzel bites.    It was a great experience, and I'm looking forward to a return visit.",

I wasn't super hungry after the festival, but still wanted to get an appetizer or something to fill up for dinner. We were seated quickly and the service was good. My main issue with this place is their selection of appetizers. It isn't very broad and there wasn't anything I really wanted to order.... I wish they had a little more variety in their apps. So I ended up ordering a main to share. I got the short rib stew dish. It was good, it was spicy and savory. The cornbread that came with it was just ok. I also tried our friends meals, both the tortelloni (which was a little too sweet and small for the price) and the pretzels with cheese fondue (pretty good stuff). My other issue with this place is that I think it is just a touch too expensive for what you get. The food didn't amaze me, which I expect when I order essentially a bowl of soup for 15-16$. Anyway, I would give it another shot, but it isn't on the top of my list for places to return to.   PS while we were there we saw 2 famous people eating there...so that may be some of the appeal (Xhibit and a football player from the Cardinals).",

Walking  thru the front door we had  to interrupt the hostess/host to ask for a table. They were in a deep conversation. Got sat,hostess not friendly at all,actually never said a word to us. Server came by super energetic but come to find out he was just  taking the drink order, All drinks came out fast expect for my wine from the bar. This place wasn't busy. Ordered an app early from the drink guy. When our server finally showed we ordered an another app after finding out all they serve is kale and leaf lettuce. She said your Nachos will be our before pretzel . Since we ordered nachos earlier that's what we expected. Well that didn't happen of course. Pretzels came out then eventually the nachos. Would never order the nachos  again!!!! Pretzels  snd fondue were yummy though!!! Not sure why the lack of service here... They had have many employees just standing around.",

    "text": "Went on a Tuesday night with no reservations at 7 pm and was seated immediately, which was nice. It did get busier with a herd of conference guys showing up, but they were put into a private dining room.  Open kitchen concept was fun to watch and the overall decor was industrial/loud but it worked.  Drinks: nice selection of specialty drinks. I had the Rhubarb Collins, made with vodka, rhubarb bitters and fresh lemon. It was delicious.  Wine selection was varied with prices from $8 - $12/glass.    Food: we ordered the pretzel nuggets w/cheese because I'd had them at Culinary Dropout and knew they were addictively good. They did not disappoint, and my friend who'd never had them before was beside himself once he tasted them. Simple, but brilliantly executed and you should order them.   We weren't terribly hungry, so we ordered a bunch of meats and cheeses with accompaniments. The quality of the food was okay, but the quantity was very small (except the bread - there was LOTS of bread).  The cheeses were $5 each,  quite reasonable in price, but the portion of each one was TINY. I'm talking a 1 inch x 1 inch block of each cheese. Meats were okay, but pate lacked the black truffle punch the description advertised.  I order a lot of meat/cheese plates wherever I go, and this one does not stand out as one of the better ones.  The one good thing was that you can build your own, even with accompaniments, so you don't get any stuff you don't like.  Service: friendly, but more than once I had to flag down someone to ask them for more drinks and other items we needed.  Waiter seemed overwhelmed even though at that point the restaurant had cleared out quite a bit.   Would I go back?  No.  I prefer Culinary Dropout and Blanco out of the Fox restaurants. In that Central Phoenix area, I would go to Hanny's a block away next time. Swanky!",

I ordered off the Prix Fixe menu and got the following: artichoke hummus (amazingness), beef short rib stew (heaven in a bowl - great mix of spicy bold flavors), and blueberry cheesecake (excellent - the buttery graham cracker streusel is out of this world!!!). I went in with no expectations and was blown away by my dinner. The flavors in each dish were simply perfect. Service was good; our waiter was very friendly and the food came in a timely manner.

It's a high energy cool spot in a great location but the arrogance of a business to charge this much for so little is spot on. I had the Fra'Mani Salumi 8.00 which was a paper thin small stack of salami and The Montchevre (goat brie) 5.00 which was a small square of cheese. Normally I've always received brie melted but this was just a small chunk. It was served with a large amount of dry french bread and as little as I eat, I was hungry when we left. Another in our party ordered the 36.00 Filet Mignon with creamed spinach and a few sweet potato pieces. This was so small that it looked like a little breakfast steak in a local chain here (I won't mention the name). Needless to say he had one of our snack bars before we left and he still went for food somewhere else. Another of our meals was the Jambalaya which was good and spicy and seemed to have a good portion and quite a bit of shrimp and sausage in it at 18.00. The waiter was nice and quick so I have to say the service was great. But none of us will eat there again.",

To put it kindly, this restaurant has fantastic decor, but is an upgraded version of Applebee's. The filet was pathetic, the pasta was overcooked and the service was about as good as visiting an Applebee's or worse. I feel bad for the residents, who seem to think this is high class food. Good luck to you all...",

The bartenders were nice enough, the waiter we met recommended the Fondue which was delicious and the menu seemed intriguing, but nothing special.  I guess I was hoping for innovative, different and fun.  It was just a regular restaurant with a nice vibe and amazing fondue!",

    "text": "FINALLY!!! Downtown has a flagship restaurant. There are many fantastic restaurants downtown, don't get me wrong, but to me, The Arrogant Butcher now reigns supreme.   The service was attentive and friendly, and they all looked sharp in their white shirts and skinny black ties.   I'm a fan of Fox's other restaurants and have always been impressed with the food. I had Toast, which was some kind of bread from heaven covered in brie and apples and something else delicious. Then for 6 bucks I got a beer and a shot of Jim Beam. Best happy hour downtown?? I think so.   The location couldn't be better. The patio is a fantastic addition to downtown streets. Now the city needs to develop those hideous empty lots across the street. Inside is open and airy with some areas for private parties and a huge bar.   I could go on and on about how awesome the Arrogant Butcher is. (How I love the name!!) It's modern, masculine, urban, unique, and such a welcome addition to downtown Phoenix.",

    "text": "arrogant [ar-uh-guhnt] adjective  1. making claims or pretensions to superior importance or rights; overbearingly assuming; insolently proud: an arrogant butcher.  Definitely True when you are here at The Arrogant Butcher!  Let me start with the service... Mark was amazing! Extremely knowledgeable and entertaining, making our experience that much more enjoyable!  The Grub: Started off with the House Soft Pretzels & Provolone Fondue and Pate of Foie Gras, Chicken Liver & Black Truffle.  Orgasmic!  Pate had the perfect blend of ingredients, not too gamy or salty! I could have licked the plate if I didn't mind my manners! The house pretzels were so soft and scrumptious! Having a provolone fondue was the perfect match, light enough to enhance but not over power!  Our entrees consisted of the Beef Short Rib Stew with Green Chiles, Fried Egg & Cornbread and Rock Shrimp, Chicken, Sausage & Okra Jambalaya.  The Beef short rib stew melted in your mouth and the fried egg was like the icing on a cake! Oh and the cornbread...YUM! I wanted to steal it off of my fiances plate!  The Jambalaya was just as impressive.  If I didn't fill up on the pretzels, pate and cornbread, I could have cleaned the entire plate!  Ready throw in the towel, Mark recommended we try the blueberry cheesecake! Persuaded by his charm, we gave in! Glad we did because this cheesecake was heavenly, not too sweet and the graham cracker streusel just took it over the top!  My friend and I would be quick regulars here if we lived in AZ!  Requesting Mark's section of course! ;)  We would definitely plan another trip to AZ just to visit the Arrogant Butcher again!",

Waiters are always pleasant but if you order your app and main course at the same time expect that both will come VERY quickly right after the other. However, drinks seem to take forever, and often are not correct. They just cannot coordinate the food with the beverage, nor at any pace other than fast food. That is consistent after many visits ( I did say the food was good). Last time, our mains arrived while the apps were still on the table- literally grab the last bite of app and then immediately start the main- while the glass of wine I ordered to go with the main arrived in the form of a martini after the dinner was already consumed. Gets busy so book arly- maybe eat at the bar.",

We came for lunch on both our visits and am impressed with the menu selection. I have a hard time deciding what to get because everything sounds SO good. The quality of the food we ordered is way above par. I highly recommend the fondue pretzels, salmon chopped kale salad, Cubano sandwich and they also had a fabulous French dip on special. Our server, Patrick was witty and very courteous. I had several questions about some of the items on the menu. He was knowledgeable about all the items and was happy to answer my questions. Refreshing experience when most servers are unknowledgeable on menu items or annoyed when you ask questions. Patrick and the Arrogant Butcher are a class act! Highly recommend and would love to come back for dinner service.",

I guess we were all thinking in synch because everyone at my table ordered the same thing.  The only odd thing is that one of the 4 people had a slightly smaller chicken piece.  Other than that, the dinner was delicious.  We sat in the outdoor seating, but I stepped inside periodically to check out the eclectic decor inside.  Lots of big screen TVs everywhere for sports fans.  Service was a little slow at first. Meaning, it took forever for them to bring waters and the drink orders, but once they did the food arrived not long after. But, we were part of a large group so that may have been part of the reason.   I would say It is still a solid place to have dinner with a large group.",

Our server Janelle was great. Can't wait to come to Phoenix again.....",

    "text": "As much as I love my Mom, I had to seriously fight the urge to steal her food. Was it because I didn't completely love her sweet potato tortelli with mushrooms?  No. The sweet potato filling, the brussels sprouts and mushroom were wonderful compliments to each other. The sauce was savory and butter-y but not over the top, it didn't cover the taste of the veggies.  No what saved my mom's food and kept family peace was the shrimp, sausage and chicken jambalaya. I was skeptical ordering jambalaya outside of NOLA but this was excellent. This seasoning was spot on and the meat wasn't dried and overcooked, which I find frequently in bad jambalaya. Proof the chef knew what he was doing ? The okra maintained their firmness and didn't become soft and slimy like okra frequently does.  Not usually a dessert person I really liked the blueberry cheesecake streusel. The graham crackers did nothing but make a mess but I loved the creaminess of the cheesecake. For another take my brother found the consistency  too soft, he didn't think it would stand up if done as a traditional cheesecake (see pics). My sister-in law seemed fond of the bathroom , venture with confidence.  My mother returned a few days after I left and had the jambalaya, so I guess she's a fan too.  Near the baseball, and basketball arena this should be a definitely spot to check out if you're ever in Phoenix.",

The salted caramel is amazing as well and full of flavor and worth the awards. We indulged and had be chocolate cake as well and it was rich and good but a little dry for a molten. Let's pause on all that for a minute.  Ok going back to the food. We had the butchers plate which had some great choices on the charcuterie and then followed it up with dinner. For the table of three we had the fried chicken and biscuit, the sweet potato tortellini and the short rib stew. All three were good and well flavored. I could have taken a little more spice but it was seasoned well. Drinks special we had the polish and the old fashioned and both were on points  Overall a great pick for dtown Phoenix with good service and a great fun atmosphere. Highly recommend",

The discerning palette will, after tasting the pretzel fondu, decide to place a second order of pretzel fondu for the main meal. Nothing quiet finishes off a meal like a desert of pretzel fondu, so I recommend that for desert as well. Each course of pretzel fondu can be paired with a different beer from their ample selection.  Follow these instructions and you will not be disappointed. I can not speak to any of their other food since I have not wasted my time trying it.",

Tourist Food. Expense Account Food. i mean, it is what it is. drink selections non-alcoholic suck. if ya wanna booze, i mean, this place is more of a Bar with food service so there ya go, imbibe away sonny! but i gotta say, what they serve -- steaks, chickens, cobb salads etc -- they do well...again, like a Houston's. is it good for you? absolutely not. does it taste good? yes. and there my fellow Phoenicians lies the funky conundrum. Parking impossible. if i'm going to Suns or Dbacks, parking is easy because the big structures arena adjacent are convenient and (compared to other cities) affordable. but sh*t, ANYTHING ELSE downtown outside of the few metered streets, fahget about it. you can take that lame-*ss underground CityScrape structure and shove it. SO painful to slog your way down to Level 20 visitor parking and a damn chore to get out (get in line Jimbo).  Service in restaurant decent. probably a bunch of ASU students. not great. not bad. meh. Crocodile Cafe level of friendly.  overall 3 star. well prepared unhealthy food with a million drink options. all over-priced for downtown/tourist peeps.",

The service was outstanding and the food quality and pace of our dining was better than I've had in a long time with a large party. Appetizers came out, and main courses were delivered at the perfect time and with 100% accuracy. The kitchen really has it together and was firing on all cylinders!! You can't go wrong with the Arrogant Butcher!",

He eventually found it and said that someone else took it??? For that reason, it took them over 20 minutes to seats us.... with a reservation.....  Once we got to our table, our waiter was super rushed and frazzled and listed at least 5 items that they were out of. Weird!   I ended up getting the New York strip and it wasn't special at all, especially for the price.  Not planning on returning. This place is too busy and can't keep up with itself.",

We both work in the industry and I realize how annoying it is to say that but I say that because we often order a lot of food, an app to start, two entrees, and dessert almost every time we go out. We also like to drink. We usually sit at the bar because it's faster service but not here. We always sit down and wait for someone to acknowledge us and even if it's not busy this seems to take awhile. We wait a long time between ordering and then we sit there with empty drinks making jokes about how we could never get drunk at a place like this. We also joke with each other that they probably think we don't tip because we look so young, even though we always tip well even when we get bad service. Like this place but even when we are craving it we usually decide to go  somewhere else because we remember how slow the service is. Not sure what it's like at the tables but bar service needs to pick it up and stop just walking around aimlessness when people at the bar are waiting for you to notice they need something.",

The guy next to me ordered a burger and asked for it to be cooked medium. It came out as dry as a hockey puck!  So overall food not very good, small portions and overpriced. Will try another place next time I'm in town.",

We started with crispy shrimp appetizer which was delicious and the sauce that comes with it is fabulous. I had prime rib and my date had sea bass the prime was very good as were the scalloped potatoes that came with the only downside was that the au jus was very bland. I tasted the sea bass which was also very good. The service was a little slow but this could be because the place was very full. I did not see an empty table in the place when we left and I heard someone say the wait was over an hour. I guess it was a good thing I got there early. I will go back for sure next time I will either make a reservation if they take them or arrive early again.",

The chicken was tender with just the right amount of crab!  We tried the Pink Drink and another cocktail that I can't remember the name of but it had blackberries on top. They were both decently strong and I loved that they use fresh ingredients!  We ended our meal with the Blueberry cheesecake. It was very rich and creamy with a crunchy delicious topping.

First when you walk in you are overwhelmed by the size and magnitude of the place. It's is huge, cold, very warehouse like. It reminded us of a Cheesecake Factory or TGI Friday's. Big cookie cutter chain restaurants. Second, the food was nothing spectacular. We had the salmon dish which we could get anywhere else. We also tried the beef short rib stew. I counted 4 small chunks of beef in the whole pot. It's more of a vegetable stew.  The blueberry cheesecake was yummy. Third, the service was rushed and robot like. \"Get'm in. Get'm out\".  All in all, we will NOT be coming back. Not worth the money, time, or experience.",

I ordered the scallop dish and the first time it was amazing. One of the best all around dishes I had ever had. The second visit I ordered them, and they were raw in the middle. Fluke perhaps? Last night I gave it another go and the vegetables were undercooked and the scallops were chewy. Sad, really. I seek out restaurants with consistent food quality. This is another to add to the list of unpredictable, sub par meals.   Plus side: Waitress was friendly and relatively fast. The Pinot noir wine offered is one of my favorite bottles ever. The ice water is good, and thankfully doesn't have a weird taste that is commonly found in restaurant water.   Was hoping that the third time would be the charm but sadly, I don't think I will go back for a fourth.",

    "text": "On our staycation to Phoenix, we were drawn to this place by the name and menu options. I will say the Butcher has a reason to be Arrogant.  For our appetizer we order the smoke salmon dip. It had a pickled relish that really made it pop with yummy flavor. The entree I picked was the chicken stuffed with crab. I will tell you now that the name is a bit misleading.   When one thinks of stuffed chicken, it's usually a single chicken breast cut in the center stuff with filling. It was actually crab sandwiched between two cuts of chicken. Don't take that as a complaint, because it's not. I actually like that better than what I thought I was going to get. It gave me well seasoned crab that was surround by juicy chicken that also has that grilled crispness. The meal also had a butter sauce with capers. I am a sucker for capers, they just add a great vinegary type tang to dishes that makes me want to gobble the whole thing up.....which I did.   So in short:Go Here.",

We sat as the bar as we usually do at restaurants. This place was pretty busy when we went, but we were able to find two seats together.  Our bartender had a nice personality and was on her game. She was the only one working back there, so she was having to make drinks for everyone at the bar and everyone sitting at tables. Not a huge deal, but definitely helped cause a longer wait time for things than would probably be the case if she had someone else helping. Still, she was attentive and made sure that we had everything we needed.  We ordered wine which was good and priced about the same as every other restaurant we had checked out in the area. We also ordered a cheese board with two delicious cheeses. One I had never tried before  and was happy that it was on the menu. The portion size was a little small for the price, but it was still tasty.  We also got the house soft pretzels and provolone fondue. Let me just say, you get a ton. We probably should have done just the cheese or just the pretzels and fondue because you ended up getting so many pretzels. They were awesome though. A lot of people in our area had ordered them, so you know they're doing something right.  I'd love to come back to this place if I was ever in the area again.",

However the staff was great about getting tables ready quickly and sitting people in a timely manner. Once seated we were treated to a great dinner in a very timely manner.  Drinks and appetizers came out quickly.  I split the Butcher's Antipasti Platter with a friend which was very good.  The meats were delicious and the olives were a great contrast.  For my main course i had the New York Strip, medium.  The NY was cooked perfectly and the flavor was fantastic.  We all had a great time here and the staff who constantly checked on us and were friendly, who seemed like they truly cared about our experience definitely were difference makers in our evening.   We all agreed we would definitely come back here again if in the area.",

The food is definitely satisfying and above average and offers up options for almost everyone.   My only complaint was that I wish I could have gotten their Caesar without Kale...aka minced cardboard.  I was a little surprised to hear our server say that it wasn't possible.  So, does that mean that their salads are pre-made or...the pantry chef is also...\"Arrogant\"?...sorry, I couldn't resist.  That said, my salmon on the salad was cooked perfectly and I was able to tough my way through some of the mixed Kale and Romaine salad.    In previous visits, my French dip was killer and their burgers are also crazy-sick delicious.    Just a Tip: if you can find a any parking....valet at the hotel around the corner for $5 bucks.  They'll also validate your parking for you too...",

I must say that it's the best cornbread that I've ever had that was with the homely stew.  The cornbread was perfectly crusty on top with warm, buttery goodness, lovingly soft on the inside and simply treasurable!  It was fitting as an evening arrival in downtown.   Iced tea was point on and refreshing for the warm weather.    I think the raw oysters could have been better.  It had that taste of maybe sitting there for awhile and not fresh.  Phoenix isn't near the sea so don't expect it that it is conveniently from the sea.  Do get the meat dishes!    They have artisanal charcuterie and fine meat entrees.  I was pondering over the meatloaf or crab stuffed chicken!  Both sounded special and mightily appealing!  Decided on the stew because I wanted something homely.  Spacious dining and nice outdoor area.",

This is hands down one of the better restaurants in the Phoenix metro area, I've eaten here multiple times and every time it's a great experience, seating is fast, service is great, and I've never seen my ice tea glass go empty. I tried their daily fried shrimp po'boy special and it was the best one I've had outside of New Orleans, but seriously everything here is good, but make sure you ALWAYS get the pretzels.   If you are in a rush I wouldn't recommend it, not because the service isn't fast, but because you will want the time to enjoy your food and the atmosphere.   Our server Nikki was amazing, and I was dining with my aunt, who has dietary restrictions and Nikki was incredibly knowledgeable about the menu and made ordering a breeze. (Also did I mention she never let my ice tea get empty??)   So if you're still reading this review you should stop and go get some pretzels and whatever else looks good to you on their menu!",

Goat cheese stuffed peppers are great snacks, the devilled eggs with crispy prosciutto were excellent, and even the chopped salad (which typically means boring) was above the bar. Nice vibe not only from the setting but all the staff seem to be having a good time and were yet very attentive.",

We were a party of four that ordered two meatloaves, Fish and chips and a salad. We had two house cabs and two sodas the bill with tip was just under $100. Fish and chips was very  greasy, meatloaf was just like the hostess horrible and the salad was something you would pick up at a gas station store. I wish I could post negative stars for the hostess alone.",

Oysters are kinda on the really small side but that could be due to the geographic location of fresh, larger oysters I'm use to.",

So they sat as we enjoyed our appetizers and drinks and got a little cold.  Not good for my Prime Rib sandwich :(  The real bummer of the night and celebrating my Birthday, was ordering dessert.  We ordered the peanut butter dessert and then was told 5 minutes later it was still being made.  Oh ok no problem we can wait.  Then another 5 minutes pass by still no pie.  Now almost waiting 15 minutes or more NO pie!!!  Not even an apology dessert for the wait.  So we left and went to have dessert elsewhere.",

My friend had been there plenty of times before and suggested we go. I had the strawberry thyme cocktail, which was delicious and refreshing. As a starter, we had the pretzels and fondue. As someone who is not a fan of cheese and pretzels, I didn't know how I'd like it, but I was pleasantly surprised! I am a fondue fan, so I think that really tipped the scale there. For the entree, I tried the meatloaf and absolutely loved it. The portion was large, which made it a great value, and the potatoes were rich and delicious. It was an elevated take on the home style classic. My friend had the sea bass, which she raved about. Overall, we had a very enjoyable meal. The atmosphere is lively, the servers were attentive; I will definitely return!",

My only issue is  I would have preferred happy hour but didn't realize it was just in the bar, and the host didn't mention that.  I was interested in a lot of the menu options, but we were waiting for a concert, so I didn't want to eat a lot of heavy food. I ordered a can of some kind of beer that I wish I remembered because it was delicious. This is the type of restaurant where they always bring you a chilled glass and pour most of it out for you. Not necessary, but it was nice.  We were in a quiet corner in the back but noticed everyone seemed to be eating the pretzels as a appetizer, which we ordered. We received a fairly large basket of pretzels plus a fondue pot of cheese with a small tealight under it to keep it warm. What a cute idea! The cheese stayed warm without overcooking while in the pot. The pretzels were delicious, just the right amount of flaky salt.  I ordered their caesar salad, and it was delicious. It came with a few vegetables I didn't expect, which I really enjoyed. I don't care for brussel sprouts but didn't even notice them. The only issue was the dill in the salad. Instead of chopping it, it had had a lot of dill sprigs in it, which wasn't great to eat. I just moved them to the side and picked off little bits here and there.  Overall, a bit pricy, but you'll enjoy the food, service, and atmosphere.",

In my opinion its the best restaurant in DT with out going crazy upscale. They have sports, have a bar, and comfortable dim lit seating for a great night of conversations and company.  Family style this place and get a few appetizers. The nachos are average. Pretzel Bread with Cheese Fondue was DANK. Hummus was DANK. Oysters were DANK. My favorite was the cheese fondue tho. Perth scallops were big pieces and juicy. Pops in your mouth.   I HIGHLY recommend this place. Come here and show your friends you know cool spots in DT PHX",

    "text": "Arrogant Butcher is exactly what Downtown Phoenix has needed for awhile: a restaurant with a great atmosphere, yummy food, friendly staff and one that takes reservations!   This afternoon, I dined here for lunch and was pleased from the get-go. I arrived a little bit before my fellow lunchers, so I put our name in. It must have been perfect timing because about ten minutes later, the place had a line out the door. So for note one, I say to come at off hours, so for example, come at 11:50 instead of 12.   The atmosphere here is open, airy and fresh. I love the sidewalk patio and the windows so that even if you aren't eating outside, you can still experience the fresh air and outdoor feel. The bar is seated in the middle and I noticed several local brews on tap. I also noticed several tasty drinks such as a skinny berry mojito. Since it was the middle of the day on a Tuesday, I didn't get the chance to try it, but you better believe that I will definitely be back!   Now let's move on to the food. Have you been to Culinary Dropout? If you answered yes, then you will be well familiar with this food. Sam Fox did an excellent job of mirroring the menu from his Scottsdale restaurant for the Arrogant Butcher. I saw that they have a similar Turkey Pastrami on the menu and I was told that the sweet potato tortellinis are to die for, more like dessert. Unfortunately, I personally didn't try either, but I did have the Grilled Chicken Tabbouleh with avocado added. It came in a rather large bowl and I will admit that I ate every last bite it was so good. The dressing is an Oregano vinaigrette and the salad is graced with grilled chicken, cucumbers, tomatoes, feta, almonds and a couple other secret ingredients they didn't list on the menu.   After our \"ladies who lunch\" 'esque meal, the staff happily validated our parking (making my parking free!) and sent us on our way. As we walked out the doors, we were met with the carpenters union who decided that today was the day to protest, but that's what happens when you're in a real city right? And if that's the case, Downtown Phoenix...you are well on your way!  This seems like the perfect spot to eat at before a game, especially since they accept reservations and they are across the street from the stadiums! I did overhear the hostess say that there aren't many tables that seat more than six, so if you are coming with a large party, you should probably call ahead to ensure seating.   Bravo Sam Fox. Another job well-done.",

The only reason I give it 4 stars, instead of 5, is because the entree menu was completely unavailable until 5pm.  We shared three different appetizers, two of which were on the happy hour menu.  We got the crispy shrimp, pretzels with cheese, and nachos (the latter two being on the happy hour menu) to share - all very good. Finally, they honored our discount that we got from signing up for Fox Concepts emails.  Overall, a great place that I'll probably visit again.",

When we arrived the bar was packed and very noisy. Our reservations were honored on time and we ate in an attractive, quiet room filled with Arizona memorabilia. One in our group had the prime rib special, which he said was excellent; another had the Smoked Salmon Rillette, which was good but had hardly any salmon in it (disappointing) and I had the hamburger which was delicious and perfectly prepared.  Our server, Mark, provided upbeat, attentive service (unusual in restaurants anymore). The Warm Peanut Butter Cup dessert was a lerdown. It was like a warm peanut butter soup and way too sweet. The cookies with it were stale. The wine selections were pricy but that is common at most of the Fox Concepts restaurants. All in all, we enjoyed out meal and would probably return.",

Our experience downtown has been great. Sorry to end our weekend on such a downer. We should have listened to our friends.",

Now granted we did not have a reservation but it wasn't that busy.  We checked in at the hostess counter and she never said \"Give me a couple of min and let me see about a table\" we got nada...  So we stood there for five minutes and then I finally said... should we go to the bar for a drink?  It was like she forgot about us.  It is the little things in customer service that go a long way and I wish some businesses would train their staff on those things.  I swear if I hadn't been wearing heels and already walked 5 blocks to the place I would have found another place to go.  We finally got seated and we both got a glass of wine.  I had the hummus plate and kale salad which both were SO good.  I love it when restaurants have kale, its really underrated!  My bf had the butternut ravioli and it was super good.    The service was good but he seemed to disappear a lot, which was kinda annoying especially when I would have had another glass of wine had he come back to check on our meals.  Wanted to give this place more stars but they definitely need to step it up on the customer service aspect.",

Not a great selection of beers on tap but they were very cold and well priced! Staff were very friendly and accommodating. We ordered the pretzels with cheese fondue for an appetizer. Delicious and fun! I ordered the smoked chicken Waldorf salad which was a little over dressed but the chicken had a great smoky flavor to it. Not too smoky which was nice. The fish and chips were amazing according to my daughter so I had to try a bite. I have to agree with her! My other daughter ordered the french dip and she was really happy with it. I would love to give this restaurant e 5 stars except for two things: the salad, and the fact that our food was brought out too soon after getting the appetizer. Otherwise, we'll definitely be back.",

Nothing spectacularly mindblowing on the menu, but certainly things that make you say, \"Hey, sounds good\".  Really kind of dig the bar (physically) and the overall feel of the place.  Bunch of TVs, and not everything was sports (hey, sometimes it's fun to ad-lib for muted movies! - I don't care for sports in a bar generally, but some people will see that a plus).  Could do without the lack of tap selection; pretty weak overall.  Also, the gin selection is odd.  Many liquors seem to have 6-10 brands/bottles, while gin has 3 brands, 4 types (can't knock them for that though, just odd, being a gin drinker).",

My husband had the jambalaya our friends had the New York strip, and we shared the pretzel fondue and the mussels.  Plus for desert we all had the salted caramel pudding. All of these items were delicious. I had the carnitas and it was very mediocre. There was hardly any meat and it was in round balls, the corn cakes were slightly burnt, and the greens over powered the flavors. The service was alright he kept leaving too quickly and we ended up having to ask other waiters for things. This might be a one off situation so I would go back again and hopefully wont be disapointed.",

There was a small wait for a table despite several tables being open. Once seated we were greeted fairly quickly. Our drinks arrived promptly but that was where it ended. I was able to finish my glass of wine before our order was taken. We ordered some charcuterie and two entrees. We waited 45 minutes for our appetizer! It was meat, cheese, and some accompaniments. Really? From our seat I could see that the kitchen looked completely disorganized. I witnessed several servers pulling managers aside to resolve issues and the table behind us had complaints as well. Our entrees arrived while we were still eating our first course. They were hot but the dark meat chicken in the jambalaya was dry. How on earth do you end up with dry dark meat? The scallops were also well done. After waiting that long we didn't bother to address it with our server. It seems like there is a lot of potential there but I cannot say we will be rushing back any time soon.",

    "text": "Just checked out the Arrogant Butcher this evening with the boyfriend. The place was surprisingly crowded- a very good sign. We were seated very promptly, and our waiter was very quick to come up and talk to us about the restaurant and the food.  We would up getting the pretzel bread fondue for an appetizer. The boyfriend got fish and chips, and I got the short rib stew.  The fondue was GREAT. It was a last minute buy- I saw another table that had it and got it on impulse. Best impulse of the night. The bread bites were warm, soft and fluffy, and the fondue light and savory. The two of us polished off the rather large bowl with more ease than our waistlines would probably like.   His fish and chips were good. They weren't out of this world, but very decent nonetheless. The fish was melty and flaky, the batter crisp and not too thick. The fries were just fries, but were also crispy and warm. They were the best thing to dunk into my stew gravy.  My short rib stew was AMAZING. It was a bowl of short rib stew in a savory, chile and pepper sauce with a sunny side egg on the top. A piece of cornbread came along with it. The spiciness of the stew was perfect- savory and with a kick, but not to the point where I was crying. The cornbread was sweet, but savory too, from what I could gather was lashings of melted butter on top. The friend egg made it out of this world.  I got a cocktail that the waiter recommended- can't remember what it was named, but it was vodka, lime and muddled raspberries and very clean and refreshing. Quite enjoyable.  But what took the restaurant from 4 to 5 stars was the service. We were unfortunately seated behind a group of very rowdy patrons. They were noisy, vulgar, and had the unfortunate tendency to slam on the table very loudly. But we're city folks, and I live in the hood. You tune this stuff out, and it really didn't bother my boyfriend or myself too much.  I liked that our waiter apologized to us for it. It was annoying, but we assured him all was well. However, when we were walking out the restaurant manager himself apologized about it, gave us his card and told him to ask for him the next time we went there, to make sure he could go out of his way to make up for this experience. I didn't think the experience was dampened THAT much by those a-holes, but I was extremely impressed by the effort made by both him and the waiter. It shows Fox's commitment to making sure that their patrons are taken care of. And that's really awesome.   Definitely go check them out.",

The first time I went here I was eating at a restaurant for the first time after a very strict diet due to being in treatment for disease.  I misunderstood the menu item I ordered and when it appeared I knew I couldn't eat it.   I HATE a-holes that send back exactly what they ordered, but I didn't want to risk my health progress or getting really sick in public.  SO... I just told the waitress (in a few words) my situation and she helped me special order something, no charge for what I sent back.  I seriously was mortified sending it back and she made me feel a lot better.   Since then I have frequented and I'm happy to order whatever I want.  It's all really delicious.  Even when they are super busy you get great service.  I can't say enough about this place, please go and experience it for yourself!!!",

I had heard so many good things from reviews and friends but I was underwhelmed with the food and the service.  We went during happy hour after we did the Yelp Shopping Crawl so the place was packed and the atmosphere was nice. We sat outside but the space heaters kept us nice and toasty.   We didn't have to wait to long before we got our drink orders in and we started off with an order of the soft pretzels and fondue. I have had this same dish at Culinary Dropout and they are so good (plus during happy hour they are a discounted price so even better).   I ordered the Turkey Sloppy Joe which was pretty good (I did like it didn't fall apart like crazy), but I wished they noted that it comes with mayo on the menu. They didn't mind giving me a fresh bun that was mayo free. I really liked the side salad that came with it.   A friend ordered the beef burger and they got his order completely wrong and our server didn't seem to care. I hate making a big deal out of messed up orders since you never know if it was the kitchen or the server and people make mistakes, but I think they could of been a little better about it.   Everybody has a bad day occasionally, so I think I need to give this place another shot. The crabbed stuffed chicken sounds particularly tasty.",

    "text": "So after hearing about this place and then reading about it in the latest Phoenix Magazine, we decided to give it a try with our friends.  We made a 7:15 reservation for 4 for a Saturday night.  By the time we left the place was hopping and crazy busy.  We started with a little salumi and Cowgirl Creamery Inverness (oh how I miss the bay and Cowgirl whenever I wanted!) as well as oysters for the ladies.  The jam with the cheese was delish and the mustard with the meat had a great kick to it.  They are not shy with the spice here!  And the oysters were meaty and divine.  I wanted more.. so many more.  Around the table we shared a bottle of the Chablis Chardonnay, which was crisp and refreshing, just what you need on a summer night in Phoenix.  Mains ordered were, short rib stew, salmon, jambalaya, and the bbq ribs.  All were enjoyed immensely.  The salmon was cooked perfectly, the stew was spicy and filling, the jambalaya had a growing heat to it (which my friend enjoyed, it just slowed him down), and the ribs disappeared so quickly I'm not sure my husband actually ate dinner. :P  The cole slaw that came with the ribs was yummy, as that's the only bit I got to try.  For dessert we ordered the blueberry cheesecake and the hot chocolate cake.  The desserts are served in little mason jars which makes the portion just right to share so you can get that taste of sweet.  The cheesecake with the graham cracker streusel with almonds was yummy.  And the hot chocolate cake's cream on top was very good and the cake was nice and moist.   We had a great time and we'd go back again with visitors or family.  They validate your parking and ours was free since the food came out so fast, we were in and out!",

We ordered Prosciutto ($10), Goat Brie ($5),The Sweet Potato Tortellini with Mushrooms & Hazelnuts ($12), and the Chicken Stroganoff ($16).   The Sweet Potato Tortellini blew my mind! It was super buttery but fluffy and full of flavor. I really loved that they made the pastas here (including the Chicken Stroganoff) in-house. Everything tasted amazing and was priced reasonably for the hearty portions.  The actual interior of the restaurant felt more casual than anticipated but that's fine and probably more appropriate given the location (next to the stadium and lots of people/foot traffic from that). They have a spacious dining room, outside seating (covered), as well as plenty of seating surrounding the bar in the front-center of the restaurant.  Overall a solid spot and I hope to return on my next trip to Phoenix! I'm still thinking about those Tortellini!",

The last time I was here I had their Wednesday special of meatloaf with mashed potatoes and green beans.  Great portion size and enough to bring leftovers for lunch the next day!    I had the pleasure of enjoying this place again!  I didn't know there an additional room towards the back!  So we sat there and began with some chit chat, but unfortunately waited longer than usual for someone to acknowledge our party of 4 to even get us water.  Luckily, that did change and we were compensated with 2 servings of their delicious and popular appetizer:  pretzel (freshly baked) and cheese fondue.  I ordered the pork carnitas nestled on top of a sweet corn cake, drizzled with tomatillo salsa and avocado chunks (also with cabbage and cilantro) ($14).  I loved the combination of sweet and savory!  It really was a lot for me to try to finish after all that pretzel and cheese.  Not complaining!  I also ordered and enjoyed their Moscow Mule.    I also sampled some of the scallops entree, which was enhanced with bacon and bacon flavoring, snap peas, and other bits and pieces of garnish.  This was a nice lighter dish to follow after an appetizer.    Our waiter was very friendly and pleasant to have.  We all enjoyed our dinner!  I would definitely come back here again to try more of their tasty dishes.",

I loved the sauce because duh, it has capers in it. However, the crab was a tiny bit fishy the time that I had it. I'm really sensitive with fishy things so I ended up scooping it out of the chicken and giving it to my fiance.   I've also had their roasted beet salad with chicken for an entree {this is great because you can over-indulge in the pretzels} and I loved it! I would absolutely order it again.   I usually recommend Arrogant Butcher to friends who are visiting and staying in DT Phoenix. I'm sure we'll be back eventually {like when i'm craving pretzels and cheese}!",

    "text": "Our first time eating at The Arrogant Butcher and we are big foodies who travel and go to all restaurants overseas and in USA. Based off reviews I thought it was a no brainer.  The food definitely not impressed.  The hostess staff was extremely friendly and very helpful when making my reservation. The waiter not so great. My hubby ordered me a glass of wine while I was in the rest room. Glass came But no wine in  or carafe until around 5 minutes or so later. Very odd.  He ordered app of crispy shrimp and we must have waited more than 20 minutes. People around us who were seated way after us had their apps sooner. Our waiter came back because he saw us looking at him and he said he would check on it, but he never came back. Finally he brought them piping hot, but honestly they were not so great and a little overcooked. When shrimp are overcooked they are chewy. Some were definitely chewy.  My husband ordered a cheese burger fries and coleslaw. They made it a double patty but hardly any cheese. The coleslaw was filled with vinegar and way too much mayonnaise.It was terrible and tart.    I ordered the Diver seared scallops with Brussel sprouts and sweet potatos,  It was so very salted that my tongue burned all night at concert I went too.The scallops were poorly seared since they only seared one side. The dish was not cheap so I expected much more. The Brussel sprouts were also EXTREMELY salted. Glad I had the potatoes since that helped break the salt. I couldn't drink enough water.   We had a 2 1/2 hour drive and were very hungry she we arrived so I ate it anyway. My husband hardly finished his burger-didn't eat slaw at all. We did not want to complain, but a nice lady asked how it was since my husband had a plate full of food leftover. He did express his opinion and they took the appetizer off the bill which was nice, but the bill still was $60 before tip.  Will not be eating here again even though the staff was nice-food was definitely not worth three $$$ dollar signs. I expected much more.",

    "text": "A fried egg?  With Green Chile?  Okay, well, I'm feeling open-minded, which does not often happen with Green Chile, so I go for it.  To be fair, it seems like every time a Chef wants to differentiate, he tosses a fried egg on it, \"There!  Magnifique!\"  Well, okay, this time it works.  I am a green-chile snob and I fall in the camp of \"it's not chile if it has beans in it\", so again, dubious about this concoction of Short-Rib Green Chile stew, I tried it anyway.    The yolk from the perfectly cooked sunny-side up egg blended into the chile, quickly disappearing while adding a rich texture to the savory sauce.  For me, the chile spice was a bit mild, although it did have a pleasant afterburn that let you know this was a southwestern dish.  This was a thick stew of tender beef, beans and chiles served with a moist, buttery cornbread muffin on the side.  While I could dicker about the ingredients, I cannot argue that it was not tasty, albeit a bit on the salty side.  Washed down with a smooth Kiltlifter Scottish Ale from Four Peaks was a perfect choice.  My wife had the Chicken Stroganoff, a pappardelle noodle dish with a sauce that reminded her of Coq au Vin.  Peas and mushrooms complimented the sliced chicken, making this dish a winner.  Youngest daughter had grilled Salmon with fried potatoes and had no complaints.  It's difficult to get any sort of description from the young ones, so as long as she liked it, which she did, I consider it a winner.  Kids had the salted caramel pudding dessert and raved about it.  The one thing that was a big negative for me was the service.  Impersonal is the word that comes to mind.  \"Hands-off\" is a phrase that comes to mind.  While the server did his job adequately, he was slow at everything, and did not check back until we were practically done with our meal.  I wish he could have been more present.",

A menu like this could be a place that does good basics so well that it changes your life, or it could be above-average pub food and sadly I think it leans more toward the latter. Don't hesitate to go here, though, if it's where your friends want to go. You'll get good service and something tasty.",

It was like straight out of a cartoon.  For dessert, we enjoyed the chocolate cake which was pretty delicious.  It was very moist and the little bits of salt was nice.

I was expecting it to be the sticky consistency of caramel but it was smooth like pudding. I was then told that because I ate there the previous night that they comped my dessert which was awesome.

A few of us went to lunch the other day and one of my buddies orders the prime rib french dip.  The server asks if they would like mushrooms, peppers or onions to which my friend replied yes, please.  They were kind enough to charge $2 EACH for said add-ons so $6 total additional charge.  I mean seriously, I can get ten pounds of onions for two dollars... I ended up splitting a chicken club and a ~1 oz. cheese 'plate' with a friend and we both got iced tea.  $24...to top it off the waiter was kind of a dick.

Second, when the bill came, oddly named item with a charge of $15. We discovered it was my glass of wine. She supposedly brought me the most expensive one on the menu. When asked if that was the cheapest glass if Pinor Noir on the menu, she said yes. It was not, there was an $8 glass.

This place has a great menu and bar selection.  I loved it.  No for the bad part, a couple in our party of 8 ordered scallops.  Six of our dinners came out in a timely fashion.  We politely waited for the pair of Scallop orders.  Food was getting cold so others started in.  After 15 minutes, we tracked down someone in the open kitchen only to find that they ran out of scallops.  No one bothered to tell my colleagues.  This was rather unacceptable and lead to my less than 5 star rating.  The ultimately ordered salads as an altternate.  It would have been only three stars, but they did ultimately recognize the issue and thee manager was ultimately quite apologetic. Hence the recovery on an additional star.  Would go back for sure.",

Their salads are excellent, but the portion size is between a standard dinner salad and an entree salad at most places -- plus having protein added is an upsell (and they don't list the price).  My wife loves their grilled salmon (she's ordered it twice), but the portion size isn't enough for her, which is funny because she is always the one that brings half of her dinner home.  Final note - the salted caramel pudding is fantastic.",

    "text": "OK. We liked almost all the food that we ordered. We'll start with the stuff we like.  Double cut chop- my dinner mate INHALED it.  Said it taste like bacon.  Was served with little baby potatoes which she dipped into my cheese fondue that was served with my little pretzel bites. Life changing when you do that.   Lemon chicken rice soup.  Very flavorful. Lots of chicken and a good amount of rice. Huge chunks of carrots I don't care for but east to pick out.  More like traditional chicken rice soup with a clear broth as opposed to Greek lemon chicken. Another hit.  The show stealer- this HUGE bowl of pretzel bites with the cutest cheese fondue.  Freaking delicious. We dipped anything and everything we could into that crack cheese fondue.  Life changing.  The only downsides were the Greek (or green) goddess salad which had too much pepper or something else that made my other dinner mate cry. It burned her throat.    Other downside was our server was somewhat disengaged. She had friends who stopped by and was more concerned chatting up a storm with them. I think we flagged down 2-3 their servers to get us what we needed and address the salad issue. When our server finally did come around, she was argumentative with my friend.   Nicely decorated place.  Other staff was friendly. Prices seemed reasonable for the amount of food we got.",

    "text": "Shalorena (pretty sure that was her name) was the worst server I've ever had and made my party and I feel unsafe and uncomfortable.   I came to this restaurant a previous time with a colleague. The wait was about 30 minutes so we went next door to the roof top bar to have a drink before dinner. The Hostesses we very organized and asked us where we wanted to sit and If the table we were taken to was ok. Our server was Yasiin. He walked. Through the menu with us and gave us some recommendations. He even upsold us on dessert. He gave us an amazing experience and I ended up coming back the next week.   The food was delicious. We ordered the Salmon and truffle fries.   The atmosphere was busy but not hectic. Very pretty space and super cool bathroom with seating area.  Our second visit I came back with more colleagues. I had be raving about this place so I was extremely happy that we could be accommodated without a reservation. This time our sever was Shalorena. She could not give us any details about drink pairings and couldn't even describe what the dishes looked like. I asked her how big the Ruben was and she said \"Well its a sandwich\". Duh i know it's a sandwich i didn't ask you what it was I asked you how big it was. After our food came out she completely ignored us (it wasn't even that busy) and we had to flag her down for our check. We let her know that we will need closed copies of the check after we added tip (we were on company travel and need to itemize everything). She brings us back extra copies of the check, not closed and without the tip. We explained to her again that we need closed copies with the tip added to show the final bill. She rolls her eyes and snatches the checks from the table and from my colleague's hand and storms off. At this point we are in utter shock. We flag down a supervisor who ends up being the manager ( I believe her name was Trista) to request that Shalorena does not come back to our table and we inform her of what's going on. She was very sweet and apologetic. Shalorena was on her way back to our table with the checks, but the supervisor stopped her and grabbed them from her. She rolled her eyes at the supervisor and walks off. It was such a bizarre experience.  I know everyone has their bad days but if it get to that point you  need to excuse yourself from the floor or find another type of employment that doesn't require customer service.  If you come here ask for Yasiin. He will give you a real dining experience. Also, they validate parking. I always forget that part. But there is garage parking they validate.",

We had a reservation for 5 at 4:30 PM and walked in wondering what was the point of having a reservation was because the place was empty and they said the reservations for 5 PM were filled. About an hour after we sat down the place filled up and there was a reason why. The shrimp appetizer was solid, and the scallops combined with the Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoes is to die for. The scallops themselves weren't the best I have had as far as size and the way they are cooked. That being said I would definitely come back, as the service and food is solid all around.",

It was a great way to start off my day :)  When we walked in, the restaurant was packed but we were seated immediately and the service was great! The seating was super cute and we got a really comfy booth. Everyone was really kind and even as we were being seated, the server made small talk with us and got to know us a little! There wasn't too much of a wait for our food and our waiter was super attentive, friendly, and helpful.  The waiter recommended the turkey pastrami sandwich, so I ordered it with a side salad and loved it! To be healthy, I ordered the side salad (lettuce, greens, cherry tomatoes, parmesan, and vinaigrette) instead of fries and it really complimented the sandwich. A few friends ordered the fries as a side for their orders and they looked super good so you can't really go wrong with that either. It was a super fair price for the quantity of food.  I was here with five others and all of their food looked amazing too. One friend ordered a BLT and didn't enjoy it because she thought there was too much bacon (not really a problem for me, but just something I thought I'd add). Another friend got the chopped salad for $5 and it looked really good if you want a cheap and light meal. For a friend with a nut allergy, the waiter took note and ensured that the chef was aware.  I'd definitely recommend this restaurant if you want great service and a filling meal with a fun, American vibe!",

Wide big streets with no people to watch or even interesting architecture, it was a snoozer. I digress, this is about the restaurant, not the city.   They had good menu choices and so I chose what I felt. A nice beet salad sounded great, a side of prosciutto and blue cheese and some fried shrimp with aioli dip. All were just ok. The salad was a bunch of lettuce and not mixed greens like I envisioned. The meat and cheese plate was eh. I didn't touch the meat--tasted off, not even palatable. The fried shrimp was more than ok with the dip being the savior, but what was great about my meal was the friendly service from beginning to end. Without my cute and personable server, it would have been a very bland meal.  Great potential but it's definitely not dining in San Francisco. I must be spoiled being born and raised in the culinary capital of California.",

The oysters along with some mid-day Minestrone and a wine were just what the afternoon ordered for a snazzy lunch.

    "text": "We have meant to stop in here for years - yes three years to be exact. We just aren't the downtown, paid parking, hipster folks I wish we were. But tonight we ventured out!   I was very concerned about going to such a high rated and highly reviewed restaurant on a Friday evening. We arrived as a party of three at 7 PM. I was shocked that there wasn't a wait! We were quickly seated in the back seating area, where there were two TVs - one playing sports recaps and one playing shark week followed by jaws. Talk about a win!! Good food AND sharks?   Our server was excellent and I am a jerk for not remembering his name. He gave excellent recommendations across the board. The service was prompt and personalized. The food was excellent. As my photo description says, I could eat endless amounts of the Au Gratin Potatoes. The prime rib was perfectly cooked. I am someone who loves medium rare meat, and often times restaurants are overly cautious and serve you something closer to medium than to rare. Not the case!   Honestly, we didn't need dessert. Seriously... we ate too much. However, our server really sold us on the pudding. So glad we tried it!   Excellent dining experience, oh and they validate parking!o",

We ordered the $11 pretzels with \"provolone\" cheese... and while the pretzels were great (and plentiful) and the cheese was good, it was legitimately Velveeta and notsomuch provolone.  I ordered a Mediterranean salad which they accidentally added chicken to and I was required to wait awhile but received no discount. It was good, but only about 40% bigger than my husband's side salad with his turkey sandwich.  They do have a kid's menu, but it's not printed. It's a laundry list of all things kids like. My kids had the mac-n-cheese and it definitely tasted like the same cheese sauce from the pretzels, though good.  All in all, things were fine and good even. The quality of the cheese was something I was hoping would be different and the service was good for the most part. I'm not sure I'd be back. We really like a few other Fox Restaurants but not so much itching to return here.",

FOOD Pretzels & Cheese - They are very generous with their pretzels and cheese portions. In San Diego, we usually only get maybe four pieces out of what they gave us here. And we are used  to getting cheese in a tiny little bowl. Here, you actually get enough cheese to finish your pretzels!   Fish Tacos - This was okay. Always on a fish taco hunt but these are standard. Nothing spectacular.   AB Cheeseburger - There was a different flavor to the sauce that they used but I can put my finger on it. It was an overall solid burger.   I can see this spot being a great one when there is a game! Very convenient.",

Wonderful hostess, fantastic waitress, pretty clean place, nice atmosphere, but my goodness gracious, how hard is it to grill a Filet Mignon? I ordered the steak medium-well, waited 20+ minutes, took a bite, it tasted like he dropped the salt shaker on the steak. Of course I complained, since the price was $39.00. Waitress was very sweet and told me she would notify the manager. The manager comes by, apologizes and says they will grill up another one. I wait longer than 20 mins (in my mind I'm thinking 20 mins is a little past the Med/well level), the manager personally serves me the replacement filet and to my surprise, it is burnt totally black! (Photo attached) Waitress, comes by to ask how is everything, I look up at her, I look back at the steak, she says, oh, it's burnt- I look at her and I shake my head, speechless, she says she'll be right back- manager comes back, he looks at it with a clueless look on his face, he asks me what's wrong, I look at the steak, he looks at the steak, he apologizes \"again\", tells me he'll take it off the bill, I cut the steak open, absolutely no pink whatsoever, I'm starving, so I trim off the burnt layer, drench the meat in steak sauce, take the bill, tipped the waitress 20% because she was sweet, looked at the bill, and they still charged me for the steak! I feel screwed.... never going back.",

The crab stuffed chicken is so amazing! And Gluten Free options!  The negative: I made reservations. This was our first time trying this restaurant. We drove an hour just to try this place so my husband could review for his food blog. When you make reservations it prompts you for your phone number and email. Anyways we arrived to the parking garage right at the reservation time. No problem, cause where we entered to park was right next to the restaurant. Except this is where the problem lies. Once in the parking garage, we got lost trying to find the restaurant, which in turn made us late. When we finally found it, we were told our reservations had been canceled and we would have to wait 25 minutes for a table. Mind you, the table we finally sat at had been empty and clean since we arrived. The hostesses are stuck up idiots with sour faces. Would it hurt them to be pleasant, educated on their easy job title and smile because they are representing the restaurant they work for?  Plus: Food and servers are AMAZING  Negative: Hostess service is crap",

Server introduced himself and welcomed us as this was our first visit. Explained some options on the menu and made some suggestions as well and never did we feel rushed.  We started with the Butchers Platter comprised of the chef's favorite cheeses and meats. A True charcuterie with this AMAZING house mustard! Aged White cheddar, goat Brie, truffle crescenza, prosciutto, hot coppa, salumi and all the fixin's like cherry marmalade, pistachios, olives... we. Ate. It. All.  Not sure about the oysters ( after all he's a butcher not a seaman ) we ordered two. Then two more and then another two just to be sure. The jalapeno mignonette was zesty and the perfect concomitant, a simultaneous explosion of flavor when eaten with the oysters.  Our little had the kids cheeseburger and he demolished it! Usually the fries are the first to go with him but not here, he was all about that burger.  The hubs and I had the french dip large enough to share with coleslaw. The horseradish was fresh and made this sandwich one of the best I've ever had.  Feeling like a couple of gourmands, I would have to say we left the Arrogant Butcher five star satisfied!",

    "text": "Very nice higher end type of gastropub right in the stadium district of downtown Phoenix.  Food was restaurant quality on the entrees and bar quality on the appetizers.  The drink options were a little week in my opinion considering the pub-like atmosphere and location to a sporting venue haven.    We began with the buffalo chicken appetizer.  Sauce was underwhelming, especially after the waiter hyped it up so much.  The wings themselves were dry rubbed rather than wet which I typically don't like anyways.  Tasty but not the best buffalo app I've had.  The cheese ravioli was cooked perfectly, slightly under-cooked, and huge portion size.  The scallops was an interesting dish at a pub, but considering Arrogant likes to promote their raw bar, I had to give it a go.  The entire dish was fantastic from the brussel and green side to the scallops themselves.  Big dish once again and very well presented.  We finally ordered the blueberry cheesecake.  Tasty graham cracker topping and perfect compliment dessert all around for our meal.  Drinks were limited for draft and bottle beers.  They had some nice champagne and wine by the glass, but nothing too absurd.  We ordered an incredible rose sparkling wine for $50 and it was well worth the price tag.    In total, the meal came out to about $130 in all.  Pretty cheap considering the quality and the amount of food and booze.  Arrogant Butcher is rightfully so a staple of Phoenix.  Crowds are expected so make a reservation.",

Then, I would get distracted by someone wanting to race down Jefferson, after my keys were handed to me, which happened to be the only exciting thing that woke me up out of my stupor from the yawner games.  That was last season. I haven't been back to watch a Suns game since. However, I finally made it to Arrogant Butcher for dinner with my Beloved wife.  This is now, to me, one of the bright spots on Jefferson street, in Downtown Phoenix!  We came here on a Saturday afternoon, and were introduced to the subdued elegance that is the interior of this establishment. The layout is open, inviting, and bustling with a fair amount of patrons.  The hostesses, servers, and bussers were cordial, attentive, polite and efficient.  I had chose the Prime Rib Au Jus with Mashed Potatoes. Although the mashed potatoes weren't particularly spectacular, the slow roasted Prime Rib had a wonderfully succulent texture. Additionally, it was well seasoned and delectable.. Each bite was just scrumptious.  About the only downside of my meal selection was the asparagus. It seemed to have been overdone, then chilled which took away most of the recognizable flavors that is inherent in this particular vegetable.  My wife had the Green Chile Stew. That too was a big hit, and the addition of a fried egg on top made for a particularly appetizing and visually appealing meal. She indicated that it was more Chili, than Stew. But, that did not detract from her overall positive comments and impression of her meal selection.  The Salmon Rillette was also particularly notable as a spread on the wonderfully prepared and grilled bread. Simply savory!",

Good: Standard selection of beers and cocktails, pricing was also par for the course of brew pubs, somewhat limited parking. Not so good: Server was disinterested in our service and completely absent until we had to call for our check.  Bottom line: Service issues aside I enjoyed the food and would visit again.",

It was a little loud, but once seated it was ok - easy enough to carry on a convo with each other. The menu was tiny - not tiny in terms of offerings, but literally tiny. One of the smallest menus I've seen. There were several offerings that sparked my interest. And I wish I was hungrier so I could've tried more. In the end, I just had the grilled salmon. It was great - wonderful veggies and perfectly cooked. Our server was friendly, attentive, and knowledgable. She checked on us often and had good menu suggestions. There are several beer, wine, and cocktail offerings as well. Portions were pretty sizable. Good quality and quantity for the price. Nice ambiance and decor. Good overall vibe. In short, I'd readily dine here again.",

    "text": "If you've read up on any of my Yelp reviews on Sam Fox's restaurant concepts, you probably know that I pretty much repeat the same story like its a broken record.  High prices, average food.  I've actually been to Arrogant Butcher before for a light happy hour, but today was my first time dining during non-happy hour business hours.  As with other Fox restaurants, each concept has its own unique twist on classic fare.  But for all the creativity, there's simply no getting around the fact that the terms \"Sam Fox\" and \"value\" are in no way synonymous.  I came here with a couple of college friends to watch the NCAA basketball tournament around lunchtime on a Saturday.  Arrogant Butcher's bar is a good spot for such an occasion with ample TVs and ample seating at the bar and the perimeter booths.  There's also plenty of seating out on the patio and in the main restaurant area.  Its the perfect location for a meal before a big event as Chase Field and Talking Stick Arena are both just steps away.  It was pretty busy for a Saturday lunch despite no big events going on Downtown that day.    We started out by splitting their famous cheese fondue & pretzel bread appetizer.  Great for sharing and pairs great with a nice cold beer.  Unfortunately they charge twice as much for it when its not happy hour.  Still, $10 isn't completely out of line.  I had read all the Yelp reviews raving about their Short Rib Stew so I went with that.  The dish came in a little pot and a side of cornbread (see my photo).  The stew was certainly spicy thanks to an ample amount of green chiles, but overall I wasn't too impressed with the dish.  I tasted the chiles far more than I tasted the meat.  And the portion of the dish was certainly not in line with the $15 price.  I also got a pair of 16 oz beers on tap which were a ridiculous $7 each.  Really?  On the plus side, our bartender was excellent.  Kept tabs on our glasses at all times and got our food orders out to us in impressively quick fashion.  I gave him a generous tip for his efforts.  But in terms of the overall food & drink bill, you could probably get the same quality food and the same portions of it for about 20-30% less at comparable establishments.  Overall, we had a good time watching the game and the aesthetics of Arrogant Butcher (as with pretty much all Fox concepts) are very pleasant with great views of the outside and a hip modern feel inside.  But as with all Fox concepts, be aware that you'll pay extra for the privilege of taking in those aesthetics (sometimes a lot extra).  I would certainly come back here for happy hour as the prices are actually quite reasonable then and the happy hour menu includes a lot of their biggest hits (both food and drink).  But as a regular everyday sit-down restaurant, you can find a myriad of places in Downtown Phoenix that give you a better bang for your buck.  After all, Sam Fox isn't the only restaurant genius in town.",

    "text": "Ahhh I absolutely love the Arrogant Butcher. I go around Phoenix and Scottsdale and try other restaurants (e.g.: Citizen Public House, St Francis, The Mission etc) but I keep coming back to my first love (The Arrogant Butcher) ;) This is definitely in my top three favorite restaurants of all time, and my favorite American restaurant,no doubt.   Appetizers: I LOVE their cheese and meat plate. The cherry marmalade that comes with it pairs up perfectly with the cheeses and the meat. My favorite cheese are the cypress grove and the prairie breeze (I found both of these at AJs and can't be happier). The Black mussels are my favorite as well. The butterly/garlic sauce it comes with is so so so so good. I could eat it with absolutely anything.  Entrees: I used to order the NY strip but unfortunately, they have gotten rid of it so the next best thing is the grilled ribeye. The succotash and creamy horseradish is what makes this dish AMAZING. My boyfriend always gets the burger which he said is the best burger he has ever had. I've had the jambalaya for lunch before which I thought was just okay, but maybe that's because I was never really a fan of jambalaya.  Dessert: Their award winning salted caramel pudding. Out of this world.   They have a great selection of drinks. I always get the pink drink as I like girly/sweet tasting drinks.  I am getting hungry as I am writing this review. Can't wait to be back here again!",

Then a blonde came to get our order, she was very rude when i asked for no mushrooms on my strip. \"Is that a allergy or just some preference?\" excuse the hell out of me? I worked in the restaurant business and never asked my customer that. You should simply agree and smile. She then gave my boyfriend the same attitude.... Our food came, it was pretty good. I was cutting my steak with the butter knife provided, she then came and pretty much slammed down a steak knife and said \"Here is a steak knife\" and proceeded to storm off.  We watched her with other customers and she seemed fine with the one paying big bucks for appetizers and drinks, sorry that we were on a budget for new years.  I just really didn't appreciate how we were treated.  Probably wont be returning for another meal there which is a shame.",

Our waiter was amazing.  We are what I think was the butcher's platter and it was a truly impressive meat and cheese plate.  I had an old fashioned but can't speak to how good it was, as if was my first one ever.  All in all, I wouldn't hesitate to go back.",

I have a sensitive stomach and no one else got sick so it could have just been my fault, but maybe avoid the burger or lunch menu if you go here :(   *GM was very polite and professional.

The restaurant has an industrial feel, good bar, and they had awesome design work. Most entrees were about $20.  I ordered crab stuffed chicken, which seemed a little healthier than some of the fried foods on the menu and it ended up being two fried chicken breasts with a crab mix in between them. It looked good but was full of celery, which I'm seriously allergic to, so my mom ended up taking half my dinner off the plate to keep me from puffing up like a blowfish. This was partly my fault, because by now I really know better to ask about celery in things, but I had been expecting just... Lump crab with chicken. So basically I just ate a breaded piece of fried chicken with spinach.  My mom had a steak that was tough, and she didn't eat much, though my sister had a filet that she scarfed down before I could even try. Dad had fish and chips that were okay.  All the waiters seemed happy and outgoing, ours was around just enough to make sure we were never out of drinks but didn't hover, brought us our check quickly. He knew the menu and scored major points with me when he wiped the table after our fondu left the table messy. My mom mentioned her steak problem and the manager came and talked with us.  I left disappointed. I'll admit I had high expectations going in there, so maybe I just expected too much. If I really couldn't think of anywhere else to go, I'd give it another shot. The menu is a little out there (sweet potato ravioli and pan cooked apples and lots of horseradish things), I don't remember seeing a kid menu so if you have picky eaters this might be a pass for you.",

Our waiter was beyond amazing, constantly keeping our drinks filled, checking in on us, and offering great recommendations. A must-visit when in Phoenix!",

We sat at the chef's table overlooking the hustling bustling kitchen, what a treat. The atmosphere in the restaurant was very nice, not too over the top and the service was great. It was a very laid back meal and experience.  We started out with the salumi and  a bleu cheese plate, both very good. The salumi was served with sweet mustard and crusty bread. The bleu cheese was served this jelly, It tasted kind of like raspberry. Both were verry good, and I think 5 or 6 bucks a piece. For my meal, I opted for two appetizers: Potato fritters with creme fraiche and truffles and the mussels with pork shoulder and pommes frites. Both dishes were awesome. Somehow, they managed to make the potato fritters super light and airy, out of this world. The mussel dish was great too, humongous portion of well cooked mussels in a killer broth. Add in a few Stella's and my total bill was around $50 with tax and tip. A little higher than I'd like for a quick stop in meal, but definitely well worth it. I'll for sure be back to try some of the other good looking items on the menu.",

The servers weren't  terribly frienly and chatty, but in all fairness they were sooo busy and were literraly sprinting around (probably working real hard to make sure they didn't get a poor yelp review for slow service ;/  ) My husband and I were in Phoenix for a few days for a convention and came here because it was highly recommended by someone who lived here for a couple of years.  We ordered: 1.  carnitas nacho, (my husband and i both agreed it was the most delicious nacho we have ever tasted, no exaggeration. 2.  chopped beet salad (so fresh and tangy and yummy) 3.  the short rib stew.. with the most amazing cornbread I have ever tasted. I enjoyed the stew (the shortrib was  small pieces and sparse. but the cornbread... I would fly out to Phoenix from San Francisco just for the cornbread! And I'm not a huge cornbread fan..  We ended going back a couple more times because we really found it so good!",

The happy hour wine was very good.   The homemade pretzels were good. Everything else was average.  The fondue dish for instance was a 100% velveeta replica that is unbecoming of a restaurant like this and certainly not worthy of being called fondue.    The dessert, a hot chocolate cake that they told me was a lava cake was overcooked, had no lava, was barely warm, and was covered with a mountain of standard supermarket whip cream. Denny's wouldn't serve it.    In short, if you want a hip place to drink and hang out with friends, this place is for you.   If you are looking for great food and value that above all else, I would probably go elsewhere.",

Our reservation was about an hour before tip off so the restaurant was packed, but we were seated immediately because we had made a reservation.   Be sure and park at the City Scape Parking Garage on Washington just west of 1st St on the south side of the road.  A.B. will validate your parking for up to (2) hours so be sure and bring in your parking stub after parking in that garage.  We started out with the Pretzels and cheese Fondue along with the Crispy Shrimp. Both were delicious and I could see myself ordering again on another visit.  The cocktails were delicious and mixed well but were really pricey, most cocktails started at $10 and worked there way up to $14 a drink.    The fish and chips were amazing--perfectly cooked fish and the tartar sauce was really good.  My wife enjoyed her fish tacos, and my pops said the food was amazing. He ordered the daily special which was a fried chicken dinner.    I was treated to a complimentary dessert for my birthday, and I went with the Salted Carmel Pudding--wowser.  So rich and yummy, just the perfect night cap to end a delicious meal.S  All in all, the Arrogant Butcher was an awesome dining experience, with delicious food priced reasonably.  I wouldn't hesitate to come back.  Check Break Down: Table of five (6) Cocktails (2) orders of Fish Tacos (1) Fish and Chips (1) Jambalaya    (1) Fried Chicken Special (2) Appetizers (1) Comped Birthday Desert    $180, $215 after gratuity",

First off, the tabouli salad had lettuce, grape tomatoes, quinoa, and feta cheese...coming from someone who makes tabouli (and the proper way to make it by the way is with parsley, burghul, and diced tomatoes just to name a few ingredients), I can assure you this salad has nothing to do with the ethnically divine dish- I mean it's not even close to being its fifth cousin twice removed! As for the beet salad I ordered, well, it was more of a regular salad with a few beets. Generally, when I order a beet salad at most restaurants, the main ingredient is beets but in this case, it was mostly lettuce with a few pieces of beets here and there. Needless to say, we both agreed that if we were ever to come back, it would have to be for something off the butcher block.  One tip to keep in mind, the restaurant offers up to two hours of free parking (with validation, of course) if you park at the Skytower.",

I'm sure some people complain about them changing their menu, but when you have so many awesome options and meats to offer, why not?! Service is great indoors or out, they have a private room for small meetings and dinners, and it's walking distance to most event venues!",

I ordered a few beers, the beet salad, and the Chef's Selection charcuterie plate.  The beet salad was big and bright - there were several types of beets, so it was more colorful than the standard red beet & spinach salad.  If you're not super hungry, the beet salad would be enough to fill you up.  The chef's plate was a fun rectangle full of food, everything from plain old pistachios to slices of smoked meats, two deviled eggs with truffles, a few thick slices of toasted bread with vinagrette, and more.  There was plenty for everyone to try everything.  Overall, a fun night in a loud and vibrant space, with good food.  Next time I'm in Phoenix, this will be the place to go with a group.",

I had looked at the Yelp reviews and it seemed like this place was going to be pretty good but found it to be just average at best. The waiter suggested the meatloaf as one of the top items on the menu so I thought yeah I'll give it a try and his suggestion was going with the macaroni and cheese as a side instead of mashed potatoes. Meatloaf was Bland and actually was served lukewarm as if it had been just warmed up under an infrared light. Macaroni and cheese was nothing special at all. Would not recommend this restaurant.",

Every staff member I've encountered, everything on your menu, the atmosphere, every single thing. Even the things that I typically don't enjoy (your meatloaf is amazing and I hate meatloaf). On Yelp I am considered a regular at Arrogant Butcher because I stop by on a weekly basis (even though its usually just for your dessert 90% of the time). I always order the caramel pudding- I swear I tell everyone how amazing the pudding is and literally it makes me happy just to eat that lol there's crack in there, yall.   So I wanted to tell you what happened yesterday. I reached a really low point in my life (I will exclude the details), and I needed to get out of the apartment. I didn't want to be alone but I didn't want to call a friend and I was so upset that I was in tears. I pulled myself together and went downstairs to The Arrogant Butcher to make myself happy with that pudding again. I sat down outside by myself at a table for two within 5 minutes time even though it was clearly busy. My waiter came around and asked me what I wanted but I could barely speak words so I told him to surprise me with whatever dessert and whatever drink and he brought me the most thoughtfully created dessert platter- consisting of: Blueberry Cheesecake, Hot Chocolate Cake, and Caramel Pudding with a Blood Orange Paloma to wash it all down- it was a presentation! The platter had hand written labels differentiating the desserts with spoons to go along each and even a smiley face :)   The thing is that even though it was a busy time at TAB, they stopped at nothing to make me feel like I was the only person there, while simultaneously handling the busy crowd around me and I felt 300% better after leaving. I'm never going to stop coming here.  Dessert & Drink Details:  Blueberry Cheesecake: Cheesecake served in a mason topped with blueberry compote and graham cracker streusel. Hot Chocolate Cake: A warm chocolate cake concoction (I can't ever tell if there's caramel in the middle but it sure tastes like it and is amazing- perhaps just a really moist center?), topped with a homemade sweet vanilla whip (Chantilly). Served in a mason. Salted Caramel Pudding: A thick salty-sweet caramel flavored pudding topped with a sweet vanilla whip (Chantilly also?) and crack sprinkles, I swear. Served in a mason.  Blood Orange Paloma: A clever mix of a grapefruit flavored Izze (that's the spritz), blood orange liquor, lime, and tequila.   Love you guys.",

My husband ordered the Beef Stew, no flavor, soupy rather than stewy and light on the beef...not good for the man. My teenagers had the fish tacos and my daughter said Rubio's were better (not good when $17 a plate). My youngest ordered the fish and chips and  said that the plate was 'light on the fish'! Two pretty small pieces accompanied by soggy and over salted fries.  My Goddess Caesar was overdressed and over-cheesed, too light on the avocado. The saving grace was the Pretzels and Fondue appetizer. I think we should have stuck with the appetizer and a charcuterie platter and saved ourselves $100. When Downtown, stick with Nook Kitchen or Bianco...",

The horseradish I believe was in the scalloped potatoes which accompanied the prime rib. The beef itself was not herb crusted enough for my own personal taste. It didn't have any richness or depth to its flavor. The salty au jus didn't help.   3  for the seafood soup   3  for some serving faux pas, such as bringing out our main entrees while we barely got our antipasti for our appetizer. Because of this, our prime rib dinner was quite cold by the time we started digging into it. Secondly, being given butter knives to cut our prime rib with, made it a tough ordeal just to try to slice off a small piece. We did get steak knives as soon as we requested them.   4 1/2  for the decor and the ambiance.   I'm continuing on with my search for the holy grail   prime rib dinner.",

The menu looked great and I can't wait to try something else.",

Server was really friendly. All in all, an okay place. Don't see the hype behind it.",

I prefer a blend of flavor instead of one dominate flavor--but that's just me. All in all, the food was okay, restaurant is a fun location, and the prices are fair.",

Overall it was pretty good food, but not sure it was worth the prices.  The atmosphere was not too bad, but again, more business crowd than others.  We sat out side which was nice, because I don't care for most of the inside tables that seem to be so close or \"shared\" areas.  It seemed like trying to have a private conversation in those areas looked impossible, and pretty much saved for \"certain groups\".",

Unfortunately the chicken strips were placed in the same beer batter as the fish and fried.  My normally adventurous - eat anything 6 year old took one bite and said \"yuck\".

We ordered Moscow mules but they did not have enough copper cups and one person got a glass. The drinks were spot on for the first round but undrinkable after that. The service was poor. My NY strip was average, similar to an Outback steak. My brother in law did not have his ordered delivered. The manger came out to apologize but his speech sounded \"canned\" as though he had been saying the same thing all night. One of our favorite appetizers is the pretzels, again disappointing when the insides were cold, they normally taste freshly baked. Many items were taken off our bill but for average food and poor service a bill for over $300 seemed steep. Overall I am so sad, this was my favorite restaurant and consistent great food was delivered in the past, not sure what happened but I will not return until I hear things have changed.",

We had a hard time choosing, but decided on the goat brie with cherry marmalade and rustic bread-delicious!! Then we tried the homemade hummus with artichokes, olives and cherry tomatoes-all served with warm pita bread. Such delicate flavors for what I thought was a pretty ordinary dish. The entree was sweet potato tortellini with mushrooms, brussel sprouts and hazelnuts in a light butter cream sauce. It was one of the most unique and delicious meals I've had in a long time.

We all loved our food, the house wines were really good. So why not a five star rating? Our waiter, he was arrogant. He took the name of the restuarant to heart.

First we started with the mussels recommended by our server and they were very bland, nothing special. So we tried again with the pretzels and cheese fondue (If everyone else was eating it how bad could it be?)  Not worth the $10 for the appetizer... nothing special about the cheese or the pretzels. the rock shrimp were good, a little small, but really the only thing that I could stomach at the table.  The deep fried cheese and bacon fritters were dried out and when I put them in my mouth it felt like I was chewing on salty, raw, uncooked dough... Thank god the bf and I split the fillet or should I say \"hamburger\" I know better ordering steak from a place like this but he wanted to try it.... I don't know how they get the hamburger meat in the shape of a fillet but they somehow managed to pull that one off. The \"after school special\" cocktail that sounded like a delicious margarita with a splash of modello, was literally the worst alcoholic beverage that I have ever tasted. I am not picky when it comes to food, wine, or booze.... and this place sent me running for the hills.   And now for the finale of the review, I got food poisoning! After about an hour or two I was so sick to my stomach that we had to go home and cancel our plans for the rest of the evening.   How in the world this place has so many rave reviews is beyond me.... literally the most disappointing meal of my life. No chance you will ever catch me near this restaurant again.",

    "text": "We went last night for AZ Restaurant Week...I really like the atmosphere, much bigger than I thought it would be!  We had a reservation so when we got there, it just took a few minutes, then we were seated.  I got the spicy sausage and vegetable soup, it was really good, nice and spicy!  My husband ordered the meat and cheese plate, it was fine, just average.  I'm sure if you were to custom order this, would be much better.  The entrees that we ordered were the Jambalaya and the Short Rib Stew.  The Jambalaya was a huge portion and quite tasty, spicy, smokey, delish.  We were really looking forward to the stew, we had seen it on the cover of Phoenix Magazine, kind of disappointing.  It seemed a bit bland, it if wasn't for the amazing cornbread, would not have completed the dish.  For dessert, we both had the salted caramel pudding, best dessert I have had in a long time.  I don't think I have enough descriptive words in my vocabulary to explain this....just salted enough, creamy, decadence, perfection.    All in all, a really nice meal!",

Waiter was attentive. We got our food right away.   We both ordered the salmon kale salad (it's not on the online menu) and it was good. Good size bowl of very bright green leaves, healthy looking. Got good chunks of smoked salmon and Marconi almonds. The cauliflower was well blanched. I can see why it was $15 - satisfying number of almonds and salmon, good size portion. I'd order it again.   We also ordered the montchevre and another soft cheese and the prosciutto. The crusty bread was good, with a touch of their mustard and the prosciutto - yummy. Bread with the montchevre and a hint of raspberry jam. Another winner. The only bad thing was we couldn't have wine with the good food - have to go back to office.   Great vibe, nice place to people watch.   I had ordered the salmon appetizer and the pretzel fondue at another occasion. The fondue was ok - nothing special but the pretzel was very good (soft in middle, nice chewy crust). The salmon appetizer was better - good combo of salmon, capers, diced tomatoes and the crusty bread was perfect.   Somebody else recommended the stew - I'll have to try that next time.   Good experience. Would recommend.",

The warm pretzels and cheese fondue is to die for, as well as the Pork and Beans (don't let the name fool you - it ROCKS!) We sat in Chips section and I was so impressed with his knowledge of the menu considering they had only been open a few days.  All his recommendations were right on the mark and his service was impecable! Thanks Chip for a wonderful dining experience!!",

We got sat at the bar area by the kitchen and it was awesome getting to watch the kitchen in action! zucchini fritters were amazing with the parmesan aioli! I got the short rib stew. Cornbread was light and fluffy with a buttery taste. The stew itself had a fried egg on top and was quite spicy. A little too spicy but it had great flavor. My friend got the sweet potato tortelli. the butter sauce was rich and the pasta sweet. The peanut butter cup was a warm peanut butter mousse with chocolate gelato and 2 cookies. The warm chocolate cake was a little dry and not very sweet. just okay. All around thought, i thought the meal was very good and i would go back!",

Beyond the pretzel bread and cheese dip, which is amazing, there is no reason to go here.  Each time we've been, they are SLLLOOOOOWWWW and not very friendly.  Last night, went to get a drink rather than sit in our car in the parking lot after the theater... they acted like they were doing us a favor having us there.  Overpriced drinks... no later night food- kitchen closes at 10.  The bartender had no personality and basically just wanted us to leave... so we did after we had to ask for our tab.  Won't be back.",

We discovered one of the gang had never had oyster's on the shell so we ordered them...they were extremely fresh and great!  We ate 24 between us!  The table allowed us to enjoy the breeze and we had a great view of the sidewalk traffic so we could people watch.  The only issue we had was our server found an old friend and kind of forgot about us until we got his attention.  Bottom line we will go back again!",

    "text": "My wife and I walked down to lunch at the Arrogant Butcher recently and had a wonderful time. The restaurant is a really interesting concept focusing on two things: charcuterie plates and upscale junk food. As these are basically two of my favorite food concepts, I was sold.   We skipped the charcuterie plates because we wanted a more solid meal (but we were excited to see Benton's ham on the overall excellent-looking menu! Benton's is ham producer outside my wife's hometown. They also make the best bacon in the world). As such, we ordered the cheeseburger and the jambalaya.  My wife' jambalaya was very good, although as someone whose family originally comes from Cajun country, I didn't find it as good as the stuff I can get in Louisiana. That said, it was fresh and very tasty (also a huge portion). The burger initially bothered me: our server didn't ask me how I wanted it cooked and I was dismayed to find it arrive well done (I like burgers pretty rare). After a few bites, though, I realized that this dish is a riff on an In-n-Out burger (it's served with cheese, freshly made half-sour pickles, grilled onions, and a sweet, mayo-based sauce). If the idea of a wood-fired, up-market In-n-Out burger appeals to you (which it should), get this. After this observation, I noticed a lot of the items on their menu are similar riffs on classic junk food (for instance, we had the salted caramel pudding for dessert, which is basically the best butterscotch pudding ever). What's really cool about this concept at the Arrogant Butcher is that they're not screaming about how this is up-market junkfood and not being ironic about it (the burger isn't wrapped in wax paper, for instance). It's just solid, unpretentious, deeply tasty food that happens to be driven by flavors not normally seen in fine dining.  We did come during lunch, so I can't speak to people having problems getting seated or with service. Our server was especially excellent and very attentive.  Overall, a really good place to eat in downtown.",

We ordered our drinks, starter, and salad when our waitress greeted us. They have runners for drinks and food service. Our drinks took quite a while arriving after both the starters and salad. There were a number or empty tables so Service shouldn't have been overwhelmed. The house salad was fresh and nicely dressed. Our drinks are now empty we ordered wine to accompany dinner. The waitress brings the wine glasses and shortly thereafter a runner dropped our entrees off. Now we have food but no wine. Waitress checks on us to see if we are 'still Ok'. We have empty wine glasses sitting in front of us so no we aren't OK. Better than halfway through our entrees a runner arrived to pour our wine.  I had the scallops and my wife the salmon both dishes were good as would be expected given the price point. We dine out frequently some places work well and make for an enjoyable experience. This just isn't one. Mechanical unfriendly uneven service",

    "text": "I spent four nights in downtown Phoenix at a conference this past week, and I only got out of the depressing conference hotel a few times, for off-campus dinners. On Friday night, I walked over to The Arrogant Butcher with four friends, and we had a nice meal.  This place was actually our second choice, but apparently you can't just walk into Blue Hound on a Friday night and expect to plonk down at a large table. We had passed The Arrogant Butcher on our walk over, and it looked spacious and charming, so we went back. (It later became apparent that everyone from this conference ate at this restaurant at some point or another.) There was a short wait--twenty minutes, if that--which we spent at the wide-open bar. We could've eaten there too if we were a smaller group, but were happy to get a comfortable table at a corner of the restaurant.  I really enjoyed the place. I feel like I've been to a lot of restaurants that might as well be called The Arrogant Butcher and liked them all. This one was in line with the rest--meat-centric menu, lightly throwback Ron-Swanson-for-Pottery-Barn decor--and very obviously established in the last five or so years. Somewhere, there's a restaurateur Pinterest board that creates this exact restaurant. Service was solid, both at bar and table. We ordered food in a couple waves and did an interesting check split, and our server handled everything well.  I had a cocktail to start and a beer with my dinner, and both were great. The Snakeskin Boots was a lovely drink made with Maestro Dobel tequila, Ancho Reyes, Cointreau, citrus, and smashed lime, garnished with a shishito (or other mild/green/little) pepper. It was very well balanced with a pleasant kick. The Four Peaks Kilt Lifter was a nice Scottish ale that took me through dinner and, it should be noted, the entire conference--this beer is everywhere in Phoenix, and I adore it.  The food was solid, the menu stacked with gastropub/trendy new American fare. We split a few hearty appetizers, and these were pretty good. The house soft pretzels were nice, fresh and fluffy bites--like donut holes but for pretzels-- served with a rich provolone fondue. The artichoke hummus was also great, smooth and flavorful, the hummus cut with artichoke, olive, and tomato and served with flatbread. Then there was the Butcher's Platter, an assortment of the chef's favorite charcuterie-type items of the day. This came with deviled eggs, smoked salmon rillettes, bacon-wrapped sweet potato, a few cured meats, a spot of cheese, olives, pistachios, a few condiments, and a bread plate. The deviled eggs were a definite highlight, topped with crispy prosciutto bits, and I also liked the sweet potato and stuffed peppers. The meat and cheese weren't anything special on their own, but the house mustard was great. The bread plate was kind of strange--the crusty bread was drizzled with a startlingly salty balsamic drizzle, and the only other option was greasy madeleines, not exactly pile-with-charcuterie bread.  After the appetizers, everyone got their own salads. I'm not really a salad person, but I was the last one at the table to order, and everyone else had gotten a salad, so you tell me--WHAT WAS I SUPPOSED TO DO? I didn't want to get the only $30 entree at the table, so I went with the crowd and ate healthy. It wasn't a bad choice. I ordered the roasted beet salad with a filet of grilled salmon on top, which gave it some substance. The salmon was excellent, moist and flaky with a good grilled char. The salad was good too, the roasted beets mixed with grilled corn, green bean, asparagus, caramelized fennel, pistachio, manchego, and crispy prosciutto. All the ingredients were fresh and tasty, and they came together well, particularly with a full meal's worth of salmon on top.  I had a great time at The Arrogant Butcher. This dinner was one of the only exciting food outings in a five-day trip, and I appreciated my brief escape from the Hyatt Regency. I'd recommend it to anyone looking for a good meal in this part of Phoenix. Even if you get a salad, you can't go too wrong.",

I recently visited and had the $44 option meal which came with one glass of wine, one entree, one salad, and a dessert. The appetizer was the Mediterranean salad. The vegetables and salad were fresh and the salad dressing was perfect for this salad. The entree was chicken stuffed with crab with capers and sauce. The entree was really good with plenty of flavor. That dessert was a blueberry cheesecake in a cup. It was very very delicious. Since the only options for the wine was a glass of Chardonnay or a glass of Cab-  I decided to purchase my own on the side for eight dollar glass of Malbec. That was probably the only thing I didn't like about the meal was that I didn't get to choose what type of glass of wine I wanted. Other than that the meal was great would definitely recommend the $44 option. Great all around atmosphere",

    "text": "When one decides to venture into the land of the Fox, it's usually because that land is full of win. FRC has an amazing group of restaurants in the valley and The Arrogant Butcher does not let you down either. The Arrogant Butcher is in the centrally located downtown area across from the Usairways Arena but also near other venues downtown, as well. May as well make a night of it if your downtown.  On a whim we came here on a Monday night wanting to test this one FRC out that we had not added to our list. We were not disappointed.  We arrived at TAB about forty minutes before happy hour ended and were quickly waited on and schooled on the cheeses of the day and the drink of the day. Our waitress was on her game!  We started with The Fix: a mixology cocktail of smooth white rum; fresh lemon; and a fresh blackberry compote sat atop this refreshing, light drink . It was 'The Fix' for our happy, alright! For $4 on happy hour! No one can complain about that!  Our appetizer was the Antipasto plate. For $8 on the happy hour menu you get a generous serving of fresh french bread, olives, a dijon mustard, a cheese of the day , (ours was the 'Montchevre; ) and charcuterie meat (ours was a dry 'Framuni' salami). We added another cheese off the cheese board menu, because we consider ourselves serious fromage people! We were torn between more of the Montchevre cheese , which is a aged, smooth goat cheese, with the look and consistency of brie or the Crescenza cheese, which neither of us had ever heard of. Our awesome waitress explained and even suggested we go with the Crescenza since it was a 'new' cheese for our palate. It came out with a cherry compote and more fresh french bread and was an ample supply. Crescenza is a creamy, almost like cream cheese with a stronger flavor and goes perfectly on the bread with a little of the compote schmeared on top. I was full after The Fix and these appetizers, BUT, we had already ordered dinner!  My boyfriend ordered the Filet Mignon. It was served with Boursin spinach that was sauteed perfectly and a few crispy fingerling potatoes on the side. His filet was a good 1 1/2 inches thick and cooked to perfection. It did seem it was over salted possibly after the cooking process and that could have been lightened up a bit. Simply, it didn't need it! It was perfect without all that salt!  I ordered the Crab Stuffed Chicken. I was stuck between about three different options, despite knowing that I wasn't that hungry! I went with this option because it sounded different. It is a chicken breast that is butterflied and egg dipped into panko crumbs and stuffed with a ton of crab meat! Then served over a bed of sauteed spinach and topped with just enough of lemon and caper au jus. Again, the salt content was a bit overwhelming, but the chicken was cooked to perfection and so tasty that I don't want to knock it for that. Literally, such ample servings on both entrees we not only could have shared, we should have shared!  As if I wasn't full enough! My boyfriend 'reminded' me how much I love peanut butter. Okay. Twist my arm! We split the warm Peanut Butter Cup that is a peanut butter mousse served warm with a scoop of dark chocolate gelato. It melts into your mouth and is more for three people sharing and not just for two!!  My rating: 5 on happy hour 5 on waitress 5 on decor and atmosphere 3 on dinner (only because of salt factor) 5 on dessert Make this a solid 4! or even a 4.5!   I will be sure to trot back to Fox! I always do!",

But be prepared to eat more than you plan to. They are addictive and will fill you up big time!!  Drinks were fantastic. Wine was wonderful nobly problem was that boyfriend wanted to try a unique beer there and they were out. We went there so he could try a couple he has never had. So that was unfortunate.   To eat we got the fish and chips- delicious!! And the pork carnitas were so good. Amazing. The combination of flavors was so good.   The service was super fast! We got the meals so quickly! And out server was great wit recommendations.   Overall, besides the beer being out, we had a great dinner date. Would definitely go back. I highly recommend the pretzels!! Yum!",

Our waiter was helpful and cheerful. I noticed the wait staff all had sleeves if tattoos and skinny jeans. They were out of fish and chips so I ended up getting a burger. It is build your own and it was very good! But my favorite was the pretzel bread with cheese fondue, so addicting  had a bacon Bloody Mary to go with and caught a little buzz. It was the mild version but woo, did it have some kick!! The cost was reasonable, and the overall vibe of the restaurant was worth it. We had a great time",

Our server Carrie was equally amazing. Very knowledgeable and friendly. The pretzels with provolone fondue were great! 11 pretzel rolls makes enough to share for an entire table. Carrie recommended an excellent wine to pair with my prime rib. She cleared our appetizer before our entrees and even asked when we'd like it fired - a personal touch I absolutely love. We were visiting a bit later in the evening, and Chef Robert came to explain that I would be receiving the last prime rib of the night and unfortunately could not fulfil my medium rare request. The meat was still delicious as a medium. Flavorful and seasoned wonderfully. My partner had the NY Strip, equally delicious as I sampled a bite. Kudos to FRC on this one. Will miss this experience when I head home. Photos of the pretzels but not of the prime rib, I was too excited to dive in.",

Non of the dishes were 'the best we've ever had'.  Some of the disappointment may have stemmed from the slow and careless service we received.  We came in for a late lunch on a holiday.  There were plentiful wait staff and kitchen staff present but from the hostess to the waiter every part of the process seemed to be in slow motion. When the food did arrive the side dish and the sandwich toppings were not as ordered.  They did correct the side dish order but again in relative slow motion.  I would only come back here if I was looking for a pleasant place to idyll away 2 hours in downtown Phoenix.  I never saw the butcher and can't say if he really is arrogant.",

The place has a very cool ambiance - nice, but casual. Everything we ordered was pretty amazing. To start, we split the roasted beet salad. Delish. My date had the Halibut and I had the Salmon. Both were cooked perfectly and I would have licked my plate, had it been appropriate. We were done with our meal, enjoying some wine (good selection, by the way) and had some time to kill before the event we were going to was starting. Even though there was now a wait at the door, our server (who was awesome) made NO attempt to rush us out. Excellent experience, great food, great service. Can't wait to go back. :)",

    "text": "If someone wants to know why I give so many 5-star ratings, it is because my wife and I usually research on Yelp! before we go anywhere, so we are rarely disappointed.  We chose this one because of the ratings and the downtown proximity to the theatre we were attending that evening.  As we approached the doors, they were thrown open by a very nice young man with a big smile, who introduced himself as Bryan and then led us to our table and said he would be our server.  Before the night was over, we gave him a very large tip because he was absolutely one of the best servers we have ever had:  friendly, warm, made excellent suggestions, and non-intrusive but still attentive.  The meal was totally enjoyable in every way.  We started with the pretzel fondue, a basket of large fresh pretzel balls accompanied by a warm cheese dip kept warm at the table via a tea light in the holder.  Delicious, but filling, and we ended up taking four of them home because we did not want to fill up on them (they were addictive!) and ruin our meal.  My wfie ordered the turkey pastrami sandwich at Bryan's recommendation, and followed his suggestion to add roasted peppers.  That was paired with a fresh garden salad with a tasty champagne vianagrette dressing.  She pronounced it all divine!! As a Southerner, I could not resist the honey-drizzled fried chicken and biscuit, issuing a challenge that it would be as good as we have at home.  It was, and the honey was a nice sweet touch versus the salty fried crust.  The chicken was well cooked and juicy--Bryan said they baked it before frying it.  It was accompanied by a creamy and vinegary cole slaw that was the best I have had on the 2-week plus road trip. We both had a local 20 oz. brew with our meal, my wife chose the Lumberyard Hefe and I finally tried the popular Four Peaks Kiltlifter IPA.  Fine dining very reasonably priced in a casual atmosphere downtown--great start to the night.  Thanks, Bryan.  Thanks to you, we will be back on our next visit to the area.",

I'm not from Tuscon, but I was expecting more from a restaurant located downtown for the prices. Go for the drinks though. The old fashioned is good and strong and worth the price.

My only complaint was that I had only eaten two bites and my entree was at the table.  It worked out well though because the bites needed to cool down so they became dessert.     I had the meatloaf special which sounds weird at a place like this, but it was excellent.   The meat loaf tasted great and the green beans were steamed just right with a little bit of seasoning.    I recommend that if you do go here that you save room for dessert.  I missed out on a few things that sounded great.",

The server we had was very insistent we all stay in our seats if we wanted separate checks, which is understandable. However, later in the meal we were co-mingling...it was a party, after all. Our server was visibly annoyed and he even said, \"This is disastrous. I'm so mixed up right now.\" I'm a server, and even if that's how he was feeling, he could have been a little more positive about the whole thing. We all spent a lot of money and tipped 20%, so it's only common sense that you would be cordial and nice to your guests. Besides that, he also just had an arrogant, if you will, attitude. I asked before ordering if the Bolognese was beef or pork. He replied, \"Bolognese is always a mixture of both,\" and just stared at me when I cheerily replied with an \"Ok, thank you!\"  That being said, the other server (I think his asstistant), was great. She promptly refilled drinks and smiled. The food was great. We had the Rock Shrimp appetizer and Sea Salt Chips, which were very yummy and served with great sauces. For dinner I had the Crab Cake Louie salad and my husband had the Jambalaya....both were delicious, as was the Chocolate Souffle.  I would eat here again, but I'm not sure I would choose it for a large group meal.",

    "text": "4 of my co-workers and I dined at the Arrogant Butcher for a birthday dinner after a long days work.  We split some appetizers and they were all great.  We had a meat and cheese plate and we ended up getting lucky and having 2 orders come out instead of just 1.  The salami we chose was great... Sliced very thin and the cheese was also great.  I had the bass and it was wonderful!  I was very happy with the portions and way that it was prepared.  2 of my co workers had the filet and they thought it was cooked incredibly well and everything tasted great.  My dad had the fried chicken and he thought he was interesting, but very good.  Just had a different take on Fried Chicken I guess?  We were also pleasantly surprised by the free dessert that we were given because of our co-workers birthday!  It was a great evening and the drinks were a-coming all night long.......  We had a great night.  The bar was crowded and so was the restaurant.  We had a blast!",

The \"famous\" onion dip tastes just like Lipton Soup Mix... good, but not famous. The chips were very good.  We won't be going back, except for maybe just a beer.",

    "text": "The hubby and I went in on a Friday night. I have to agree with Thomas about this whole cityscape fiasco, it was a little hard to find, but we got there all the same and were happy when we did. They really did a nice job with the place. I love the set up, the open bar and kitchen, and all the decor was nice.  We sat up at the Chefs table, and all the guys behind the counter were super friendly, which is above and beyond if you ask me, just getting orders out and executing them well is enough, so it was nice that they were interacting with guests on top of it. Our server was friendly as well, very helpful. The bar did start to run a little slow, our second round of drinks took awhile, but no biggie. I did, however, find the food just a little underwhelming. One of the cooks gave us a sample of the pretzel fondue, and to be honest it is what sticks out to me the most, they were delicious. We also had the black mussels with spicy pork shoulder and pommes fites, the broth was a little bland, which was shocking because they had a really intense aroma. The sea salt chips were alright and the potato fitters were forgettable. For an entree we split the grilled sword fish, which was good. My Husband was a little disappointed that with a name like The Arrogant Butcher they didn't have more cuts of meat on the menu. I think our favorite part of the meal was the after school specials we ordered, they were a great summer drink, very refreshing, otherwise we may go back, but its not on the top of our list.",

    "text": "Was told great things about this place but was left disappointed. We started out with oysters on the half shell, and a cheese and meat platter. Can't really go wrong with those (as long as everything is fresh, which it was). For dinner, we asked our server what she recommended. The sea bass was so highly recommended by our server (Amber) that 3 out of 7 guests ordered it. When we started eating it, the 3 of us were shocked by how flavorless the fish was and the side \"salad\" it came with was a mystery to all of us. We weren't sure if we were eating corn or noodles or weird oats. We all returned our nearly $40 dishes and ordered new things. The waitress messed up the order and split the scallop ravioli between the three of us. The scallops were chewy and the thick cream of the sauce left me feeling nauseous. The server had a really hard time remember our requests throughout the entire dinner. The only reason I gave this restaurant 3 stars is because they took off the sea bass charges, comped our split ravioli and had good apps. Don't think I'll be returning any time soon. :(",

I enjoyed it but being that it was the only thing that really appealed to me, I wouldn't think to go back. The prices for sandwiches and salads were on the high side. The quality seemed good based on what I saw being served at my table and our server, who we were all convinced was way too happy for his own good, was attentive and pleasant to say the least but just not my type of joint.",

We ordered the soft pretzel bites $5 which can feed a family of 4! and the antipasto platter was not as good. There was only 2 slices of tiny bread to eat with the cheeses, jams, etc..if I didn't have the pretzels I would have been pissed. Brussel sprouts came along side antipasto, they were prepared in a balsamic like marinade and were pretty damn great! Prob would go back fro pretzels and brussel sprouts but that's abt it.",

    "text": "I've been way to generous with my reviews and I've made up my mind not to give five stars unless everything was impeccable.    I REALLY LOVED The Arrogant Butcher.   I picked up a menu that was on a side table at my gym, of all places.   I've looked at it for a week before finally giving in and going.  I had a lot of carbs that night, but it was worth it!  It's good when a restaurant takes you to another place, and AB did that for me.  For a while, I forgot I was in Arizona and thought I was back in Spain with friends.  The build your own appetizer concept is cool.  Just like a sushi menu, you mark off what cheeses, charcuterie meats, cold veggies, raw bar items you want and they bring them out with sides of breads, spreads, and sauces. ALL SUBLIME!  You can taste the freshness of the ingredients and their attention to quality.  Hard to get good cured meats here and I'm already trying to plan my next outing to AB to get my plate of salumi and proscuitto on!  We ordered those meats, grilled asparagus, grilled mushrooms, giant white shrimp, oysters, heavenly pretzel bites with provolone fondue, marcona almonds, and a type of sheep's milk cheese very similar to manchego.  My date and I were in heaven!   Near the end we ended up making these little sandwiches by splitting the pretzel bite, spreading the fondue on one side, slice of cheese, cut up mushrooms and asparagus, and a pile of proscuitto or salumi...  ........ I couldn't stop smiling and we enjoyed ourselves so much because the food was so good!  Great conversation while nibbling on this stuff... Awesome night!    The only disappointment were the entrees... Maybe because we liked the appetizers so much we didn't feel the entrees?  I had the bolognese and my date at the sweet potato tortellis...  They were both good, but nothing to write home about.",

    "text": "We were fortunate to be invited to the soft opening at the Butcher.  Wait staff was exceptionally attentive and whatever we ordered was complimented by another similar item off the 'brunch' lunch menu (by 'accident' of course, but you know they were seeking more input on the recipes). Started with a mimosa and coffee, both fresh and aromatic.  Fresh squeezed OJ for the mimosa, a nice surprise. Sampled the cinnamon toast: fresh in-house made rustic bread with nooks and crannies that would make any Thomas' english muffin jealous.  A perfect combination of butter, brown sugar and cinnamon to cover those flavorful bread curves.  Not too sweet so it may not meet your taste buds if you have conditioned by the the overly sugared American fare.  Toasted just right but the plate was a bit cool, so get to them right away while still warm.  They brought out a plate of cinnamon toast with almonds that was just as tasty. Smoked salmon benne style followed as one entree and sausage & egg baguette the other.  A third entree of bacon egg and cheese  with avocado on a soft roll also arrived as a 'mis-order' that we had to try as well. The smoked salmon (in-house smoked) was light, flavorful and cooked before sandwiched between a perfect poached egg (yoke soft but not runny).  Eggs Benedict done exceptionally well.  The plate could have been larger to display this elegant compilation.   The sausage flavor made the baguette, bringing a savory spice to the eggs and peppers, as well as slightly soaking the inner layer of the baguette with juices.  Not like as mightily as say a Mr Beef in Chicago or Luke's here, but enough to grant your senses a pleasant reminder of au jour times. And while not on the same field as the other plates, the bacon egg & cheese on a soft roll was nicely executed. All the plates came with a side of potatoes delicately fried.  The potatoes were light and clean in taste but perhaps could have been kicked up with red pepper or cajenne to clarify the kosher salt.  A S'mores latte served as the dessert finish.  A fun, original and witty drink presented with chocolate and spices melted over the soft marshmellows.  enough said, we will be 'checkin-in' sooner than later.",

This is an upscale bar type of American restaurant that serves many dishes only found in upper end restaurants.  A variety of cheese, fondue appetizers, excellent artichoke hummus, raw oysters, and main entrees ranging from jambalaya, short rib beef stew, sweet potato raviolis and cioppino specials.  I personally did not order a main entree, but my friends did and they all looked amazing.  I had their pastrami sandwich with handcut fries, which I thought was amazing from the sesame seed bun to the meat.  Blueberry cheesecake was good as well!  Decor was modern and had all kinds of seating, anything from the bar to booths to regular tables.  We had a very knowledgeable waiter as well and he sure knew how to upsell.  It is a fairly pricey place, but you do get what you pay for.  Reservations are recommended, especially on a game night if you want a table.",

The pretzels and provolone fondue was an excellent appetizer, the pretzels are made fresh and on site daily. By far the best I have ever tasted. The sweet potato tortellini was the servers personal suggestion and it was the absolute best pasta I have ever had; unique and different taste but absolutely on point. I wish we had an establishment like this back at home. Kudos to the management and ownership.",

    "text": "3.5 Stars  Went to The Arrogant Butcher during its first week and for a place just getting its sea legs, it was pretty good.  Clearly the place is popular with the downtown crowd - which is clearly starving for more quality restaurants.  Casual, kind of loud atmosphere with an industrial feel to the decor.  The apps we ordered, the potato fritters and rock shrimp were both deep fried and solidly average, even though they were the top reocmmendations from our server.  The brussel sprout and squash salad, though, was excellent - I split it with a colleague.  The crab stuffed chicken was fine, but nothing special.  And, it was pan-fried - I had no idea I was ordering so much fried food.  We sampled a couple desserts and they were ok.  The server was very friendly and even comp'd us, without us asking, my colleagues' jambalaya which was too spicy to eat.  The manager also came over to apologize.  They're clearly trying hard at The Arrogant Butcher, and once they iron out a few kinks, I'm sure they'll earn at least 4 stars.",

    "text": "The writing on the front door is correct, I was welcomed to my new favorite restaurant.  Logan, or shall I rename him Logan The Amazing, completely enlightened us with a whole other genre of cocktails. Cocktails with the smoothness and subtlest flavor nuances that wine drinkers like us so adore. Starting with the Luxor cherry garnish and right on through the beautiful colors of sunrise in his Howard Hughes, the delicious smoothness of his Kentucky Draper, he wowed us with his artistic use of every type of liquor. My mind is opened and the cocktail standard has been elevated to  unbelievable heights. Oh, and yes, we did eat dinner as well... The food was completely fresh and so delicious. The oysters were as good as anything on the coast, which is a real feat for Arizona! The sea bass was masterfully prepared and the ciopinno was the best, freshest, I have ever had, and I have lived on both coasts. If you can get it, it is a must! The dinner began with the beet salad that was so nicely dressed, with such a smooth dressing that understood it's place was to enhance the vegetables, not try to make a name for itself. The vegetables (beautiful beets must be adored) were all at perfection, making this simply the most well balanced and perfect salad I have ever had. Amber was our server and we are so glad as she was a wonderful guide through our evening. She is kind, fun, and very well versed on the menu. We thank her, above all, for her dessert selection, the salted carmel pudding, and introducing us to Logan!",

Not deep fried and crunchy, just quickly pan seared and soft in the middle.  My boyfriend had a tequila cocktail that was to die for while I found that the rasberry mojito left something to be desired.  The peanut butter cup dessert is melt in your mouth good and the service has been top notch on both occasions.  Add in the Butcher's modern but comfy styling and you've got a winner..  right here in downtown.

Arrogant Butcher was only a few blocks from our hotel, but we decided to drive since we were headed to the airport after wards.  It was extremely difficult getting there by car.  The roads were blocked and major construction was all around the restaurant.  Whew! We finally were able to park in the deck!  The restaurant did validate our parking, so that was a relief. The restaurant was packed, but our wait was only 10 minutes.  We started our meal with hummus, artichokes and sweet red peppers.  We added roasted elephant garlic as a side.  It was yummy...and the bread with the appetizer was pretzel bread.  My friend ordered the Turkey Sloppy Joe and I ordered the Turkey Pastrami.  Both sandwiches were on a pretzel bun.  Both sandwiches were yummy and I would order again in a heart beat!  Turkey can be dry, but mine was the right amount of juice with a great spicy flavor. Nice way to finish my trip to downtown Phoenix, but not sure if it's worth the trip if you're not already in the area.",

We were seated in the back, where it was much quieter than our previous visit where we were seated in the room closest to the front door. We had different items from the menu. This time for a starter, I had beet salad, which I loved! My husband had deviled eggs with prosciutto which were delicious! For our entree, we both had the smoked chicken Waldorf salad. I must say I was a bit disappointed with the dish. If everything about this dish was tradional, I would have been a happy camper, but in my opinion, there was too much vinegar in the salad, which left me missing the sweetness of the grapes and apples, as well as the nuttiness of the walnuts! Nor could I taste the smokiness of the chicken.As a matter fact I don't think tradional Waldorf salad has vinegar in the dressing at all! The But our dessert of the  salted caramel pudding redeemed my disappointment of the smoked chicken Waldorf salad. It was a large helping that we shared, topped with whipped cream and we both loved it!! I look forward to coming back to explore the rest of the menu...",

I love all the exterior bells and whistles of The Arrogant Butcher including the hostess that greets you, the pleasant and hip music and the well thought out interior design.  Our waiter even kept the good vibe going with decent service.  However, our lunch choice of steak Cobb salad tells a different story.  The $14 dollar salads were lacking on more then one account.  First, the waiter confirmed our good choice and added \"I hope you like blue cheese...\"  Well the salad came with no 'blue cheese' so hence the awkward (and unnecessary) conversation pursued \"I don't see any blue cheese, is it supposed to be on there?\"  Second, the portion size was small, particularly the measly steak portions.  Consider yourself lucky to get a couple bites of the needed protein to survive.    It's weird but I was actually considering asking for the menu again so I could order another meal.  And that shouldn't be your thought process as you drop $50 for 2 salads and 2 beers...  So in conclusion, before you buy the car, be sure you look under the hood and past all the bells and whistles...",

First thing you notice is the place is LOUD, but that also seems to be trendy these days. I had the Short Rib Green Chili Stew, which is always very good here. Wifey went with the Fried Chicken, this was ok. Not great, little too much with the honey drizzle making it more sweet than anything else. We wanted the Charcuterie board, but our Waiter forgot to put our order in, so that will remain a mystery. If your feeling the need for a hipster/trendy joint, this place will fit the bill. Nothing spectacular, but great location means we'll be back.",

My husband had the turkey sloppy joe and I had the turkey pastrami. Both were really good. The turkey pastrami came with a lot of turkey! The sandwiches were decently priced, around $10-12. The entrees do get significantly more expensive.   We ended up coming back a little later to meet up with some friends. They ordered some pretzels and other appetizers. The pretzel fondue bites were so good! If I wasn't already stuffed, I could have ate more.  One thing, do not order the peach Hefeweizen. Usually like Hefeweizen beer, but this one was not good.",

If you are \"into\" food and having a great experience you most likely will find that here.  If you want to put on your feedbag you may not appreciate what this gem has to offer and may, possibly, complain about what you get for your bucks. You are not the droids we are looking for. Move along.  Both visits we delighted in the oysters. Fresh, shucked perfectly, no grit and just the right amount of brine. It would be a crime to overlook these. Sip them. Savor them with the cilantro sauce.  The starters with cocktails are served like tapas. Golden beets, chilled. Generous roasted garlic in oil with crusty bread. The only addition needed on the garlic was salt. Uncomplicated and delicious deviled eggs. The mule we had is is an excellent cocktail. The servers are menu experts on both visits and make excellent beer recommendations.  Visit one we had the sea bass and the beet salad. Our dining partners ordered the pretzel appetizer as a meal. The portions were enough without going overboard. We all were well fed.  Second visit the short rib green chili for both of us. Fried egg white perfect with runny yoke. Absolutely perfect. Seasoned just right. Unique. Warm. Satisfying. Served with a corn muffin crispy and sweet in some places with pockets of butter and pops of green chili. Utterly delightful.  Desert was the salted caramel pudding and the chocolate cake. Both served in half size mason jars and topped with real cream, whipped. Rich flavors, deep and sweet without being cloying. Excellent dark, rich decaf coffee. Exactly what dessert should be.  Service consistently excellent with knowledgeable waitstaff. We were never rushed. Parking was validated. Great experience both times. A new Phoenix favorite for us.",

    "text": "I've heard of this place before from coworkers as I work downtown but went in for the first time last week with my boyfriend. A random location we selected based on the Yelp reviews. It was about a 15 minute wait to get seated on a Tuesday night. For appetizers we had the fried shrimp and zucchini fritters. The fried shrimp...lawd... so delicious! The coating was sooooo very well seasoned and the perfect crispness. Would definitely recommend and is the primary reason why I would want to return. The zucchini fritters are actually pureed zucchini fried in a light batter. They were okay.   Entrees: My boyfriend had the sea bass and enjoyed it. I had the chicken stroganoff dish. Not impressed with it.  I wish there were options for sides as the sea bass was just the fish on a bed of creamy something (forgot what is was). The stroganoff could probably be eaten in 7-9 fork fulls. I can't say exactly because I didn't finish it all. The portion sizes are quiet modest so definitely order apps if you're hungry.   My boyfriend and I go out to eat often which include several five star restaurants and we were both throughly impressed with our server, Ian. Very knowledgeable about the menu, congenial, and pleasurable. He is amongst the top servers we've had. His happiness with his job exudes. Thanks Ian for the awesome service!!!   Overall, I would recommend this place to others.",

Our server, Matt, came over to our table within two minutes, and while he didn't interrupt us catching up with each other, he made us feel welcome and told us to take our time. It had been a while since our party of six had seen each other and we wanted to catch up. Matt quickly took our drink order and returned with our order faster than should have been possible. We asked for a little time to finish catching up and Matt willingly obliged, without ignoring us. A few minutes later, Matt came back and offered us appetizers. We decided on the butcher platter and we weren't disappointed. It was everything our server promised and we couldn't wait for Matt to suggest a few entrees. After much talk and consultation with Matt, we ordered the NY strip, the jambalaya, and the crab stuffed chicken among other things. Matt couldn't have been more right. Everything was amazing. Our friends said if any of their friends come to Arizona that they will recommend any fox restaurants to all of their friends. Honestly... 10/10. And it's hard to impress us.",

The first visit, the food was really really good. We ordered the salted caramel pudding to share and it was about the only thing I remembered after about five cocktails. I hate...HATE pudding so I was very blase about ordering it. UMMMMM.....amazing. It's super super rich and has a thicker consistency but it is out of this world for pudding.   Based on the previous experience here, we were looking for a centralized place to have dinner for a huge group of friends. We decided on Arrogant Butcher and made reservations for 7. We arrived at our table promptly and our server handled our huge group really well. We got our drinks in a timely manner and placed our orders. HUGE downside was when our food was being delivered to our table, half of our guests didn't have their food. We waited about ten to fifteen minutes for the other half of our table to get their orders. Once ALL the food was delivered almost everyone was happy with their choice. We ordered the zucchini fritars as an app and we couldn't even figure out what the heck it was looking at it and TASTING it! It looked and tasted nothing like zucchini. It was basically a basket of greasy, fried, nothing. It honestly looked like someone scraped whatever was at the bottom of the fryer and put it in a basket and served it as an appetizer.   The ambience is great and the service is good. The food is a bit lackluster for the price .",

Okay sized bar (about 16 seats), good music, staff was very friendly and attentive.   I came during happy hour and got their mule. It was really great and $5- can't beat that!   I ordered the pretzels and provolone cheese dip. The pretzel bites were bigger than I expected and they gave me about a dozen. The portion was way more than what I was expecting, especially for a happy hour app. The cheese dip came over a tea light so it stayed hot which is awesome. But. The cheese dip had no taste! I was actually worried it'd be too strong, I'm not a huge fan of provolone. I wish they had mixed in some cheddar to give it a bolder taste.   I also ordered the sweet potato tortellini with chicken as my meal. The tortellini was very al-dente and the sweet potato flavor wasn't very strong. The chicken seemed to be pre-cooked little cubes like you'd find in a salad kit. But the mushrooms were good, definitely the highlight of the dish. The sauce wasn't quite a wine sauce, wasn't quite a cream sauce and it also had no flavor. All in all, and it kills me to say this- it was very similar to a pasta dish you'd find in a college dining hall.",

    "text": "From Sam Fox's Restaurant Concept group that brought us Culinary Dropout, Arrogant Butcher lived up to their name.  Long wait times, even with a reservation; self important wait staff; and prices higher than the food warranted- good, but not amazing.  After waiting at the bar for about 25 minutes past our reservation time, we were seated in a comfortable booth, but waited another 10 minutes to see any wait staff.  We also waited almost a half hour between courses.  It was a good tactic if the goal is to keep you ordering drinks.  We started with the Tabbouleh Salad $8 and the Crispy Shrimp $13.  The Tabbouleh Salad was good, but not exactly what we expected.  It was more akin to a dinner salad than Tabbouleh you would expect at a Mediterranean restaurant.  The shrimp were drenched in oil and not something I would recommend.  For entrees, three of us ordered the special- a 5 oz filet and 3 scallops with creamed spinach.  The entree was good, but given the menu prices, we were surprised when we received our bill that it was $56.  The fourth in our group ordered the Sweet Potato Tortelli for $15.  She seemed the happiest about her meal.  For dessert we picked the warm peanut butter cup chocolate gelato and the salted caramel pudding for $6 each.  Both had a cloying sweetness where you could only eat a few bites.  However the peanut butter cup was pretty tasty if you dipped a piece of the cookie in the gelato.",

My plate came out and the presentation was nice, but the chicken was very tough. It was very thin and overcooked so much that ai thought that I had the wrong meal save the crab which was a thin layer, also overcooked. I thpught the chicken was a fried mashed potato cake that was well fried, but it was a thin slice of chicken breast. No spices or flavorings. The crab stuffing was maybe a total of about a teaspoon an amount and it was the better part so it was sad that it was such a little amount. I expected a little more since it seem to be very busy and the reviews were really high. Perhaps it was just an off night for my dish. For dessert we ordered the flourless chocolate cake. And it was a small little piece that was equal in size to a scoop of ice cream that sat right next to it. It was garnished with fresh raspberries and a sauce. It was very good. I wish there was more.

Any time we have something to go to downtown, I first see if there is an available reservation at Arrogant Butcher. I can't ever pass up those damn pretzels and fondue and a glass of bubbly to start a meal.  This past weekend I chose the grilled fish tacos and they were outstanding. The smashed avocado added to each taco was perfect and the little ramekin of white beans and pico on the side was so tasty.  My husband had the beef short rib stew, served with an egg on top and a corn muffin on the side. He wasn't feeling 100% (I very nicely passed him a cold I picked up a while ago) and this was delicious comfort food for him.  Service and ambiance are always top notch. I should really apply to be America's Next Top Fox Fanatic.",

I hadn't gotten a drink yet, and had to wait another 10 minutes before I got one.  The meatloaf I ordered was pretty basic. It was supposed to come with some mashed potatoes and beans, and there were tiny bit of those, but more like a garnish than actual side. The meatloaf was also covered in about a quarter inch of ketchup, so there's really no way to describe how it tastes and accept like ketchup. Pretty lame considering the place is supposed to be known for its Meats.  If you're in the center of Phoenix and looking for a place that doesn't suck, you might want to keep looking. Fortunately, you have a lot of alternatives.",

The hostess forgot to tell us this and by the time we switched over to the bar area it was packed. In terms of food selection, the happy hour is limited to five appetizers. The biggest highlight of the happy hour was their rum, lemon and berry compote cocktail, The Fix. They also have wine, beer and shot deals, so if you are just going out for drinks and need a place to validate your parking pass, then the Arrogant Butcher's happy hour might not disappoint.   Next up, the flavorless fare. I was really surprised by the how bland all of food was. The AB Cheeseburger with double the meat was pretty small and sad despite the double meat price tag. While the cheeseburger didn't taste bad, it certainly wasn't anything memorable. I also tried the Fish and Chips, which I would recommend avoiding unless you like your Fish and Chips quite greasy, with a heavy and smooth batter rather than the traditional thin and flaky batter. The Zucchini Fritters were bland on their own, but tasted okay with the parmesan aioli sauce. Maybe I caught this place on a bad day, but the food was certainly nothing to write home about.",

    "text": "We're a group of healthcare professionals (NPs, PAs, and MDs) that meet every month to catch up and decompress from our crazy jobs; there's about 8 of us. We arrived a bit early yesterday for happy hour, only to find that happy hour was cancelled due to the Rush concert at US Airways. Who cancels a published happy hour? So clearly, they just wanted to make more money off of the concertgoers with no regard to the typical customer. We ordered drinks for the lot, only to be asked every 20 seconds to get out of the way of the serving staff because the place was so packed and there was barely even standing room. There was no way to not be in the way. We got seated on the patio (because an inside table was a 2-hour wait) pretty quickly. However, the misters were broken at the table we were seated at - they worked fine at all of the other patio tables, but not ours. There didn't seem to be any regard for the fact that it was 107. We asked to be reseated, they said they couldn't accommodate us anywhere else. We asked about a group of 2-tops that were available, were told they were reserved. I offered to sit at the table with the broken misters until something else opened up, but they said they didn't know how long it'd be before another table opened up. We were pretty much ready to leave (I had said we'd just pick up some wine and go back to my place to make pizzas) when the \"reserved\" 2-tops suddenly became available and were rearranged to accommodate us. The server acted like we were a complete bother to him, like he'd rather be somewhere else with a different group of people. Really didn't engage us very much. The appetizers were fantastic (shrimp and pretzels) and were gone in a heartbeat. Three of the eight of us ordered the prime rib. I joked that I didn't even want mine cooked (i.e., as rare as possible), and the server told me it was already cooked and my request was not possible. I was kidding, of course, but it wasn't received very well. When our food came, only one of us was given horseradish to accompany our prime rib. When I asked for horseradish for the other two, the server said, \"oh, you want more?\" No, I want SOME. I would say my prime rib was medium-rare at best. It was OK, pretty fatty, but that's a risk you take with prime rib, I suppose. I was going to order another glass of wine, but I couldn't get the attention of the server and he didn't come back to the table to check up on us very frequently. When he brought me a to-go box, I had asked for more au jus and horseradish to-go, so he brought me an empty container to put my remnants in instead of fulfilling my request of new. We usually meet at 6:00 and don't leave until about 9 or 10, usually sit around and have a few drinks while we chat. But this time, we all left by 8 and all went our separate ways. The consensus among the group was that we wouldn't be back, individually or as a whole.  I've been here before and enjoyed myself, but I really won't be back after yesterday's experience.  UPDATE 9/7/2015: Chelsea, manager, messaged me for my phone number to talk about my experience. I sent it to her. Haven't heard a word back. Moot point, really, as it doesn't change my opinion about the place for better or worse. Just solidifies it.",

I ordered a side of grilled asparagus and a side of roasted peppers for 3$ each. The asparagus is served chilled with pepper and balsamic vinegar , but grilled first. Luckily I told them I just wanted mine served hot and grilled with olive oil and sea salt only and they were happy to do that. I assumed the roasted peppers consisted of a pepper cut in half, brushed with olive oil, spices/ sea salt, and then roasted, boy was I disappointed. The peppers were thinly sliced, much thinner then one would see on a vegetable tray. There were 4, maybe 5 red and yellow peppers grilled sitting in a small bowl of oil. There was more oil in the bowl then I would consume in 2 weeks. They would be better off seasoning and basting before grilling and serve an entire pepper cut in half. If you need to raise the price to 3.50$ then do so. They have decent food for the most part, just ask how things are served because it may not be what your expecting. I don't mind paying $ for good food, but the prices sure don't reflect their chief.",

That being said, the meals were huge!!  I ordered their Sloppy Joe, which was recommended by our waitress.  She said it was out of this world.  Well, it was just alright.  It was good, don't get me wrong, but definitely not worth ordering again if I ever came back.  My man ordered a cheeseburger, which he enjoyed.    We were first seated at a two seater booth, but we wanted to sit next to each other.  When we asked if we could move, the hostess looked confused and perplexed.  She eventually moved us, but she reacted like it was a huge deal (more like nervousness).  The restaurant was empty, and she sat us in an area where there was a server.  I am not sure what the issues was.  She was sweet about it though. Maybe she was new??   Our waitress was also somewhat spotty, and our drinks ran dry for quite sometime before she ever appeared again.  We didn't even order anything crazy.  I had a water and my man had a lemonade!   I wish I could blame it on our waitress being busy, but the restaurant was still dead.  So, not sure were she ran off to, and when we tried to spot another waiter/ress down, they too were hard to find.  Overall the food was good, but the waiting was ok.  I wouldn't come here again unless nothing else was open.  I am not even from Phoenix and I can tell you that there are too many better options to choose from in downtown.",

Perfectly fried, seasoned, tasty batter, clean shrimp, and the peppers they served tossed in with it are fried as well and aren't super spicy.

The hot soft pretzels with provolone fondue, salted caramel pudding and the Sweet potato tortelli.   I figured one out of three isn't bad so I decide yes on the pretzels and picked the fish and chips for lunch.   I tried to fight it. I'll be damn if the pretzels are really good. I figured it would be good but not like everyone was saying but after eating 4 without even noticing I have to admit they are really delicious .   Fish and chips are cool and the fries were tasty. The fish being halibut is a bit too buttery for me. I think a whiting would have been better or something a tad bit stronger tasting.   Next time I return I will get the Tortelli and dessert and if they are as good as everyone say I will upgrade them to 5 stars.",

It isn't actually on Jefferson but is around the corner off First Street.  But once we found it, it was a great start to a great evening.  We shared the pretzel fondue as an appetizer. There was plenty for four people. The pretzel bites were soft with that wonderful pretzel crust. Cheese was warm and was plenty.  Our table ordered the filet mignon with creamed spinach, carrots and potato.  It was cooked perfectly to medium.  Coming from the Midwest, I am picky about my steak and am rarely satisfied with beef outside of the region. This was quite possibly the best filet I have ever had this far west.  The pork chop was more of a pork cutlet (no bone) and had a very flavorful breading and a mushroom gravy that really defied your usual mushroom gravy standards.  The sweet potato tortellini was spectacular as well.  The tortellini was large and generously filled.  Personally, I think the tortellini was too rich (if there is such a thing)  but delicious.  The service was excellent. Everything arrived just when we needed it to and was piping hot.  The decor is upscale but casual to dressy casual.  There a lot of people who looked like they were just coming from work and others like us who were starting their special evening out.  The noise level was moderately high but we all were able to talk with one another without yelling across the table.  The wine list was mediocre.  Nothing particularly special about it.  Their mixed drinks and beers were more note-worthy. I suggest the Pink Drink if anyone likes a fun version of a Cosmo. It was a healthy pour.   We will definitely be going back.",

    "text": "I found everyone in Phoenix to be very pleasant and the staff here was no exception. They accommodated my anticipated large dinner party and when we turned out not to be so large, they simply took the end table we weren't using about midway through our meal. Our server was very laid back, but made sure we had everything we needed at all times. The food came out quickly, was hot and delicious.   The pretzel fondue wasn't bad, I would've preferred like a cheddar cheese instead of melted provolone, something more sharp and flavorful to go with the fluffy pretzels. I loved the salmon appetizer stuff! That was unique and tasty, definitely recommend it to those who like lox.  The ambiance of the place is probably why a lot of people keep going back; and it's especially nice as the sun sets over the city of Phoenix, you can drink in the atmosphere and cool breeze all while inside, sitting comfortably. Next time I'm in town I would definitely go again.",

Salted caramel pudding was excellent. I'm a huge creme brulee fan, and the pudding was nice and thick and reminded of the creme part without the brulee. :)  Lunch the next day. had the smoke cubana sandwich which was just about the best sandwich I've ever had. Just awesome!  Another winner for Fox Restaurants.",

Trust me when I say that the sweet potato tortelli is UNREAL and you will NOT want to share it. I believe you get 6 of the dumplings with the dish, so again, don't share if you're hungry, lol.

If I could write a short review it would say:  + Pristine Service + Great Place to Hang Out + Great Drinks + Food hits the spot!  Just go. Get your parking validated! Plan sufficient time!  CUSTOMER SERVICE Buuuut I am a wordy nerd. And I have to give really give props to the customer service here. We showed up on a Thursday for lunch and had the fortune of sitting in Robert G's section. Showing an excitement level I don't think I've seen in a server *ever* he walked us through the delightfully robust menu. My taste buds salivated at the many options. Robert G. got more worked up as I ordered my porter beer. (They stock an excellent porter on draft! Deschutes Black Butte). When someone shows that much passion for their work it rubs off on everyone.   OYSTERS | GET'EM! Based on Robert's elocution and delivery we, of course (!), had to sample some Boston oysters from Cape Cod. Oysters come with many accoutrement options beyond cocktail sauce and horseradish. We were sold on the jalapeno mignonette. It's this green, spicy heavenly goodness. The vinaigrette comes consists of cilantro, cucumber, shallot, jalapeno + red wine vinegar + v.oil.  I'm sighing thinking back to how delightful an experience it was slurping my little raw guys down. I'm from the east coast. This Phoenix locale delivers raw oysters superbly. Had I not already placed a food order I could have contently eaten oysters the rest of the afternoon. (I'll come back and do just that.) GOOD STUFF.  ENTREES | MM MMM! My friend and I ordered at the polar opposites of the palate menu. I went for something spicy (Jamalaya). She did something rather sweet (Pork Carnitas). Both were excellent. I'd enjoy either in a heart beat again. Warning: the portions are ginormous! When they say spicy, they mean spicy. The Jamalaya is just that! Generous servings of sausage, chicken and shrimp are provided.   MISC The bar is super! It's a central feature of the restaurant. Plenty of seats for everyone. Comfortable for anyone to dine solo. And (!) a number of televisions up high were showing work related content. (I imagine that changes depending on the hour.) I just really liked how unobtrusive they were.  On our way out we noticed there were booths in the interior area of the restaurant. Something to consider checking out. The outdoor patio looks fab!  Love, love, love!  LOVE!",

We stopped in for dinner and although we were part of a small rush crowd we were quickly seated.   The waiter was humorous and prompt, and made some great recommendations for our meals. I ended up with the sweet potato pasta which is somewhat unusual for me. It was incredible! The broth was pretty sweet, but the waiter recommended the spicy ham which was a perfect balance. The wine was lovely and reasonable priced and they have a really cool way to create your appetizer charcuterie plate.   If you're a meat or cheese fan this is a definitely visit in the area. It also works well for vegetarians as the sweet potato dish rocked!",

The waiter accidentally spilled a glass on our table (which wasn't that big of a deal because of the crazy dry heat) and gave us complimentary pretzels and cheese. The drinks are reasonably priced and everyone I dinned with that afternoon enjoyed their meals. I highly recommend the smoked carnitas nachos!",

    "text": "I like to start with positives. My French Dip was quite good, although difficult to eat. No matter how I held it, it was falling apart before I could get it in the au jus. The beef was perfectly cooked thinly sliced prime rib; lean and luscious with a horseradish aioli that was a perfect compliment and not overbearing. The fries were barely warm. My son's burger was ok. He ordered a side of Mac and cheese which they forgot to bring until after he had finished his meal. It was barely warm. My vodka wasn't served until after my salad. Our waitress and food server were super friendly. The worst part was the hostess. When we walked in, rather than welcoming us, she said, \"we close at 9. If you can order and eat in 20 minutes I'll seat you.\" We had a long rough day of travel and just wanted to eat so we said yes. But the whole time everybody was running around sweeping under tables and tearing down the seafood display and hauling things off and not focusing on the substantial number of customers still there. I have worked in the restaurant business and understand exhaustion at the end of the night. But this was like striking a theatre set before the second act ended. This place is not cheap, but the food and atmosphere were fun. We thought we would give it another try tonight and go earlier. It was packed. This hostess said it was a 40 minute wait. There was no one sitting outside so we said we would be happy to sit out there even though it was a little chilly. She said it would still be a 40-minute wait. We left. This is a cool, fun place with good, although pricey pub food. Management should be watching more closely or they won't have 40-minute waits for long.",

    "text": "The first time I went to The Arrogant Butcher on a Saturday evening, the wait for three people was 45 minutes. We finally sat down.  We ordered or meals which were: slow roasted prime, chicken stroganoff, and the fish & chips. -The slow roasted prime rib was probably the best piece of meat I've ever tasted. I almost died with the explosion of flavor and tenderness. It was a huge think piece of meat, too. The scalloped potatoes were decent. -I tried the stroganoff and it tasted a little off to me. It also needed salt (flavor.)  -The fish & chips with coleslaw were delicious but EXTREMELY greasy. I personally think they should strain the grease off a little better.   Our bill was $75 for three meals and two glasses of tea.  On another occasion, I went on a Friday night around 7 or 8 and the wait was only 15 minutes for two people. Our server was awesome. Very knowledgeable about the menu. Sadly I forgot his name.   LETS TALK FOOD We ordered the montechevre, the fancy deviled eggs, filet mignon, New York strip, chateau smith Cabernet Sauvignon, and after school special. -The montechevre was bomb and the cherry marmalade complimented it perfectly. I could probably eat a whole tub of that marmalade. LOL -The deviled eggs weren't that special. I'll make those at home. -The filet mignon was SO good I almost died again. The spinach and carrots were great additions to the meat. I would order this plate again. -I didn't try the New York strip but my friend said it was good.  -The cab was awesome. Smooth and bold just the way I like it! -My friend said the after school special was overdosed with lime. They needed to tone it down a bit.  The bill was approximately $150.00  The decorations are nice and the bathrooms are huge and cool. I feel like this place is hit and miss. Some stuff is amazing and then other stuff is not worth the money. It's like roulette! I'm not sure how I feel about this place.",

    "text": "My friends and I wanted to grab a quick bite before we headed to the Mercury game, and decided it was finally time to try Arrogant Butcher since it is so conveniently located across from the arena. We dropped by during happy hour, which is valid dining at the bar or their communal table. There were 3 of us, the bar area was busy so we sat at the communal table. Our waitress was very friendly, helpful and efficient. She brought us HH menus as well as the regular menu and took our drink order a few minutes later. I got the fix, which is a rum based drink with fruit compote. It was very good, fruity and almost reminded me of lemonade. For food off the HH menu, we tried the smoked carnitas nachos, salmon and roasted pepper toast. The nachos were surprisingly really good, it was all about the cheese they used. Not your standard nacho cheese, and once all our chips were gone our waitress brought us more so we could finish off the cheese. The toasts were ok, they weren't toasted at all just a spread over bread with some toppings and too much cilantro. For our entree, we decided to get a half dozen oysters, king crab legs and a shrimp each. The oysters came with a choice of sauces, we opted for the jalapeno option and it was so good! That definitely made the oysters different than any other I've had. The shrimp was fine and crab legs were good with butter. Since we had more time to kill, we ended up agreeing to seeing the dessert menu and were quickly talked into trying their award winning salted caramel pudding. It was SO good! I was not expecting that at all. It tasted like salted caramel and had some whipped cream to cut the richness, but the consistency of the pudding reminded me more of a melted peanut butter than a liquid pudding.",

The bar was a bit chaotic for the amount of people the restaurant had in it, but drinks were well made (we had the polish fix and mule). Sat down quickly and server was great, offered lots of explanation and recommendation. The pretzel buns/fondue was epic and a huge portion.  Dinner was meatloaf and crab stuffed chicken, both AWESOME! We ended with some peanut butter pie which was just alright. We were enjoying everything else though so it didn't sway our experience either way.  Great experience, really great service, we'll be back!",

Honestly some of the best I've ever had. And the sweet potatoes w crumbed bacon were delicious too.   For the desert the peanut butter cup was amazing. You have to like peanut butter - but if you do, get this.   Staff was excellent and timing of the food was perfect. Will definitely be back.",

Super friendly and efficient service tops the modern industrial decor - big light shades, leather booths, wood and tile are some of the design features. Very tasteful colors and lighting.   We tried the cheddar cheese and some olives to start and paired nicely with a well made dirty martini. The berry compote was so good and complemented the sharp cheddar very well.  Their menu features steaks, seafood and salads. There were several exciting dishes I'd like to try but was hungry for something light so we built our own Caesar Salad with a delicious medium grilled salmon. It was the most amazing blend of lemon, grilled pepper and asparagus, and bright notes of some kind of parsley or something. It was really good.   To end the meal, we tried one of the blueberry cheesecake mason jars with a strudel crumble on the top. The blueberry topping was the same compote used in the cheese plate - not a bad thing! It was really delicious. The espresso I ordered with a lemon twist came in a nice tall clear highball sort of glass which was kind of different.   Great experience!",

This past week we decided to come for a team lunch and I was completely surprised at how delicious my meal was! I ordered the green Chile beef stew and it tasted just like home (maybe even a little better with the fried egg on top). I generally avoid meals that are around $20 a plate but I definitely would go back for this! On top of that, the server was great and super attentive.

The waiter was polite and understood we were going to be talking amongst ourselves a while so he was not pushy or rushing is to order.   I had the crab stuffed chicken with brussell sprouts. One of the better meals I have had in a while. Chicken was crispy and the crab was cooked well and very flavorful.   Always a great spot before a game for drink specials as well!",

We opted for drinks first - my husband had some bourbon on the rocks and I had a red wine. Both were delicious. Then we had the carnitas nachos which were waaaaay better than we were both expecting them to be! I highly recommend them and they're large enough to be a dinner or an app for 2-3 people to split. I had the grilled salmon and my husband had a salad. Only complaint with the salad was it came with croutons although that was not stated on the menu. Had it been, we would have asked for it without. The server offered to remake the salad but we just picked them off, which was fine. But the menu should be made more clear. The salmon was delicious. I could do without the Quinoa next time, which had a vinegar-sauce over it that I didn't love. But others may really enjoy it. Our service, despite how busy it was, was fast and the food came out really hot. Highly recommend this restaurant- we'll definitely be back.",

    "text": "Just wanted to try a new place for my birthday and was not disappointed. This place is nestled near the chase field stadium in downtown so be prepared for parking structures.   To start with the decor is very tasteful. I got seated with my party in one of their back rooms and the pictures on the wall were interesting.   Waiters and hostesses were on their game despite how busy it was. Not once did I feel like their wait staff was rude or ignoring our party.  For the food I am inclined to say that the appetizers did not disappoint. I ordered the pretzel bread with fondue and other people got the shrimp and nachos appetizers. None of them were below subpar each had its own unique flavor and look. The cheese especially with the pretzel bread had a soft taste and not overbearing. While the pretzel bread was unevenly salted on some and not other pieces the taste combined with the cheese was still fantastic.  Onto the main entrees, I was able to get the turkey pastrami and the prime rib French dip sandwiches. Both were visually appetizing and both had completely different tastes. The only bad thing I can say is the slight spice of the horse radish was not expected. As I am not a fan of horse radish this did not take away the tasteful meats in both sandwiches.  My number one place for salted caramel pudding now has a new champion. I can say hands down with the many places I have been able to get salted caramel pudding for dessert this is now my number one place. The sweet taste of caramel is neither overbearing nor is it underwhelming. The refreshing caramel taste with the whipped cream was a great balance.",

    "text": "The Arrogant Butcher treated me right. I was pleasantly surprised yesterday when my girlfriend took me here to surprise me for my 31st Birthday and that she did.   We had a table of 10 good friends enjoying different brews before deciding on our meal strategy. Before we could dabble into the Raw Bar we were greeted with two pretzel and cheese dishes. Apparently the secret was out that this was a birthday. So we carried on enjoying the pretzel and cheese and ordering oysters, shrimp and mussels. All which were tasty. The shrimp are enormous, the oysters about average and their Jalapeno Mignonette sauce was something that stood out for me. I could almost drink it, but I've got a thing for spice.   I decided to stick with the seafood theme and I ordered the New Zealand Sea Bass for dinner and it was tasty. Living in Florida the past 3 years has spoiled me with seafood compared to Arizona. With that said the price of the seafood was a little steep but the quality was there.  Everyone ordered something different and I tried a bite of each one... All were good. We also tried one of every dessert.... All were good!  I believe this is one of those places that you can't go wrong with. I will come back and thanks Arrogant Butcher for showing my group a good time.",

Shortly after I came back from the restroom I found out we had to move tables because of a large party that walked in. To me, moving tables isn't a big deal especially since we just sat but they were extremely apologetic and the manager offered to buy us two appetizers and two drinks.   We ordered the mussels and the fried shrimp. And for drinks the daisy and the sexy gin and tonic. The mussels came out on a huge platter and looked overwhelming but it was the perfect portion. The shrimp was my favorite. It had a hint of sweetness to it, like they added honey or cinnamon to the recipe and the flavors complimented each other well. The daisy was delicious and my gin and tonic was refreshing.   For our entree my boyfriend ordered the steak and I ordered the sea bass. Portion wise, his was amazing. My bass came out and it was good but it didn't blow me away which is why I'm giving this place 4 instead of 5 stars. I excepted to be wowed since the dish was one of the pricer items. And the side dish it came with had me questioning what exactly I was eating.   Our server was very nice through out the meal and everything ran smoothly. Our bill would have been $120 but they ended up taking off $50 for the inconvenience.   I would definitely come back!",

We made a reservation for 6:15pm because we were unsure if it would be busy or not. Upon arrival it wasn't packed but definitely had a decent crowd. We got to pick if we wanted to sit inside or out and went with outside since it was so nice out.   Our waiter was attentive and friendly without being too chatty or interrupting us too much. He was on top of drink refills, providing steak knives, etc. Great service.   We started with the pretzels and provolone fondue since most reviews said they were awesome. They are indeed awesome. You get a ton of pretzel bites and there is plenty of cheese. It was a lot of two of us, but would be perfect for a group of 4-6. Highly recommend.   We tried a blackberry lemonade which was super tasty. Not fake flavoring and was just right. Definitely ask if they can do this when you are there if you like lemonades.   For our entrees, I went with the crab stuffed chicken and my girlfriend got the prime rib, which came with mashed potatoes. I thought the chicken was awesome. The crab added a great variety to the taste and the sauce was to die for. It was served on a bed of spinach which was also delicious. I would absolutely order this again!  The prime rib had good flavor, however it did come out pretty lukewarm. The potatoes were the same. She didn't want to deal with sending it back, so she just ate it, but that was the only downside to the meal. If it happened again I would probably insist she send it back!  The atmosphere was causal but sleek. The bathrooms were nice and clean and overall it was a really nice experience with great food for the most part. A solid choice!",

So first off it is a prime location across the street from Talking Stick Arena Which makes it a busy place on game or event nights and higher parking fees. They do validate your parking for 2 hours if you park in the underground parking garage below the restaurant. Now onto the real important stuff the food , we did have a set menu so I couldn't choose exactly what I wanted but was happy with all the choices .  First off appetizers we had the house soft pretzels with provolone fondue which were great , as well as the spinach artichoke dip which was also really good. They also served smoked salmon toast which I didn't have but everyone seemed to like .  Then had a simple salad which was good , a little small but gotta save room for all the rest .  For entrees we had the Butchers Meatloaf which was amazing definitely a good choice as well as grilled salmon . I have included photos but unfortunately forgot the desert pictures. I will definitely be stopping by here again soon",

The cheese tasted like any generic fondue.  For my entree I order the Jambalaya ($19) and was not impressed by the amount of food and dryness of the rice.  Overall, disappointed with taste and price. Costumer service was stellar and we liked the back area seating. It was quieter",

Traveled to Phoenix with the boyfriend and wanted to stay local and close to downtown for a REALLY good dinner before we headed out to see the Horseshoe bend and Antelope Canyon the next day. And because of that, we wanted to make sure what we selected was one of the best since we didn't have much time in Phoenix. Yelped around and found this place and really happy we ended up here.  It was at a corner of downtown that was close by to the basketball stadium (Talking Stick Resort Arena). They had a great bar right in front of the restaurant for those who were waiting to be seated. We had to wait another 30 mins so we attempted to get 2 drinks by the bar. The ENTIRE 30 mins, we had NO service whatsoever so we finally gave up and that put us in a pretty grumpy mood but once we were seated, the servers were amazing! They recommended great dishes to us, we had a salmon dish and jambalaya, also a tray of FRESH oysters, YUM! Everything was great. We ended our night with dessert and that was awesome as well! It was a cheesecake but in a mini masor jar and the crust was really delish!",

They also tried to keep the prices down.  A bottle of delicious Merlot or Cabernet costs $32 a bottle which is darn good.  Come here for fun, laughs and hearty food.",

    "text": "My husband was given some gift cards to the Foxx Concepts restaurants awhile back. We have been on a mission ever since to find the restaurants we thought we'd most enjoy and put it on our never ending bucket list of places to dine at. I am to say the least happy with our decision to  try out The Arrogant Butcher especially with a name like that it could've easily been a confusing experience. The selections of appetizers to entrees were far from confusing and rather simple to navigate.  I'm starting to notice a trend here as the the other Foxx concepts place we tried was The Culinary Dropout and they both sorta had the same feel to them. Every dish we tasted was served hot fresh and quickly yet, simple with an original twist to each. As you can tell from the many different angles of pictures of my flourless Chocolate lava cake it was my favorite. Although, I do have to mention the charcuterie board came in close second as I've never had one before and still need some more experimenting. I thank Chef Ina Garten for introducing me to the lovely boards from watching her videos on Instagram and Tiffany Amber Thiessen who also put together some beautiful displays of cheese, crackers and meats, etc. From start to finish all the staff were friendly and very attentive. We were constantly getting our water refilled by our waitress. The busser's were so fast at cleaning up our table for the next guest that when I accidentally forgot my truffle crescenza and bread to go it was already thrown out by the time I got to the door and walked back for it. I was so sad. Oh well it just gives me and excuse to go back for more.  Don't do like we did and parked in the wrong parking garage. Although, we enjoyed the walk through all the construction going on it would have been much easier to have parked in the garage right underneath the place.",

Wait staff was very attentive and helpful with menu. It was difficult to get water at the bar while waiting and a water station might have been nice as it was 112* plus outside and no place to wait. Our food was not mushy or soggy. We had the enchiladas and filet. Both were cooked perfect and not over seasoned. Enchiladas had a little too much sauce but this was easily removed. Overall good experience despite how busy it was and the variable reviews.",

Their menu seemed a little random which means it would probably cater to anyone's craving. They also have good local beers which was a huge plus.

I had learned that the person that was killing the mood last year was no longer there. Meaning, I got to enjoy my meal in peace.  This time I went with the Slow Cooked Prime Rib and Smashed potatoes that far exceeded my expectation. Thank you to Brent for his recommendation and service for the night.  Still bummed this place closes early...I got there 30min earlier than last year... All in all, great food, great staff, hours could use an extra push (too used to San Diego life)  I HIGHLY RECOMMEND!  May 2018 A couple reasons why this place didn't get 5 Stars...  1. Hours of operation. This restaurant clearly resembles a bar like atmosphere, however having the huge bar in the middle, it does not stay open late. Week nights 9pm and Weekend 10pm close time.   2. The excitement put off from the person who looked like he was a manager of some sort, definitely killed the vibe by hounding the kitchen staff about completing orders in a timely manner. The restaurant was not slammed at all and the staff was moving quick as it is. I came here upon recommendation and after hearing the excitement put off, it definitely killed the experience.   Don't get me wrong tho, the food was delicious! I went with the Fish Tacos being that the kitchen was \"closing\" and I wanted to be mindful of the staff. And the Bartender fixed me a nice Jameson and Pineapple which complimented my dinner.   Will I go back? Yes I most likely will and not around closing time",

    "text": "So, I've lived at cityscape a bit over two years and this is my second time going to the Arrogant Butcher. Tonight's visit reminded me why I hadn't gone back in over a year. First, I have to say the bartender was nice once he opened up a bit, but when you have 5, maybe 6 taps, and someone walks up the bar and asks what you have, don't say \"look here on the menu (paraphrase)\". Good tip comes from interacting with patrons immediately as they come up. I ordered the prime rib with Mac and cheese. I found out that he was allergic to gluten so couldn't really help for the sides. I asked for medium rare, and saw some decent pictures online. Nope, what I got was clearly well done and hacked to death. The weight had to be wrong, which means whoever is managing quality control is ok sending out crap. (See pic). The bartender noticed and took it back and brought me a much better cut. Not the best prime rib, definitely mediocre after the experience. Particularly for $33, I could have been happier with Outback. Again, not the bartenders fault at all. He offered a dessert or beer for free, I declined both. He may have removed a beer tho, I didn't bother looking. I left as soon as I'm done. I'm afraid this place is exactly what it's named, \"arrogant butcher\". Here's the point, sure they offered a comp, but here's how you get a better rating, don't fuck it up the first time.   Tip - don't expect anything of quality or wow near two sport arenas.",

Finally after the bartender took her order and was starting to prepare her drink she noticed me, By then the damage of waiting 5 min had been done.

Roasted Tomatoes side - I had this as a starter and it was a perfect tease...right-sized portion and a tomato that combines the sweetness of a sundried tomato and the juiciness/flavor of a tomato that perfectly balances fresh and concentrated flavors. 2. Scallops - smoked cauliflower, peas, nuts and oranges...incredible balance of citrus, smoke and crunch that is all ridiculously fresh letting the flavors work.  If you like technicality the scallops were a  single-side sautee and were PERFECT!    Sorry for long review, I think I enjoyed it!",

    "text": "We were in town for a couple of days and looking for a bite on Saturday night.  After we checked online and saw no available reservations, we called and they told us that since it was a huge tourist weekend (the last of spring training), they were holding most of their tables for walk-ins.  So we headed down and were quoted a wait of 15-20 minutes.  Off to the bar!  The place seemed pretty packed and buzzing.  A couple of local brews later, our table on the patio (as requested) was ready.  Service was perfectly friendly and helpful.  We shared a plate of ham, mustard and bread to start.  I had the sloppy joe, my boyfriend had the pastrami sandwich.  Food was solid, but short of phenomenal.  It's a fairly curated menu considering the size of the place.  You know where you see 6-7 options that sound just okay but nothing that sounds like \"OH MY GOD I HAVE TO EAT THIS NOW\"?  That was pretty much my feeling towards their offerings - hence the sloppy joe.    Only hitch was that I ordered a glass of wine and wound up getting charged for a bottle - a fact I didn't catch until I reviewed the receipt the next day.  But I gave them a call today and the management happily agreed to refund the difference.  (Thanks guys!)  I was happy with their selection of wines by the glass - they seem to make a point of serving some of the less available varietals.    We don't come to Phoenix much, so I'm not sure we'll be back.  But if you're staying downtown or attending something at the US Airways Center, this is a good option for an easy bite.",

I would never pick Arrogant Butcher as a place I definitely want to go to. It's also a bit overpriced.  I've only ever had salads. The Market Salad is quite tasty. Although, it seems to have spaghetti in it. Not the grain I was expecting. The Chinese Chicken Salad is just ok; it needs more spice. The pretzel balls are legit.  They provide speedy service, and I really appreciate that, especially at lunch time. They're also very accommodating of groups.  I'm curious to try out their happy hour.",

    "text": "We had a nice long debate about whether to give this place 3 or 4 stars (from an account that has given 5 stars to pho places in the avenues). In the end, it came down to how well the restaurant met EXPECTATIONS.  If you have been to Tucson, for example. a very comparable restaurant is Hub. Similar atmospheres and rich, hearty, flavorful foods. But that place is in crappy Tucson so, pretty much having some edison bulbs down there scores you a 5 star review on the 'hip vibe' alone. But Arrogant Butcher is in downtown Phoenix and has nearly 300 reviews around 4 stars. One should EXPECT more than the typical Fox template.   The decor and service is excellent as expected.  However, the letdown came when, after enjoying the hummus plate and pretzel fondue, the angus cheeseburger came to the table. Good but so far below expectations. With all the other great items on the menu, they should have just axed the forgettable burger plate (or improve it to Zinburger status).   Also, be aware that they stop taking reservations 48 hours in advance. So, though our wait on a Saturday night was only about 15 minutes, you may want to plan ahead.",

The restaurant is like an upscale diner with a trendy bar area.  I was here with a group from a conference I was attending here. We had a 45 minute wait when we arrived at 8pm so we started at the bar. The bartender seemed a little put off when we asked to sample the craft beer options.For me the draft options were just ok. The Deschutes IPA was the best of the bunch and at least I've had it before so I knew what I was getting into.  When finally seated at our table, we ordered a few appetizers - the pretzels with provolone cheese, the shrimp, and the zucchini fritters. The shrimp was the best of the bunch with a spicy coating. The fritters were second best but the pretzels were a disappointment. They were like pretzel rolls and huge with no real flavor. Same with the cheese. Smaller bites may have made them more enjoyable.  For an entree, I ordered the sea bass which came with barley and arugula. The fish was good and I enjoyed the crispy edges but the barley was too salty portion size was quite tiny.   The best thing about this place to me was our server who was great with explaining specials, her favorites, and refilling drinks. But when you hit a restaurant, you expect the food to stand out and it did not for me.  I'd give this place a 3 1/2 but not quite worthy of the 4th star.",

Mashed potatoes were nice and creamy with a light gravy in the middle.  The cheeseburger had a sharp but not sour flavor.  Burger was cooked to perfection but was a little undersized for the bun.

    "text": "I've been wanting to go to The Arrogant Butcher ever since it opened, and, well, it took me more time than I'd like to admit before I finally made it there.  But, sometimes waiting makes the outcome that much better, and, boy, was the outcome fantastic.    Thankful I was with someone who is a regular, and who knew how to navigate us through the delicious menu. (Although, I didn't need much guidance as I had been eying their beef short rib stew since I first peeked at their online menu).  We started first with appetizers, and had a great sample of what they offered: the rock shrimp and the pretzel & fondue were amazing.  I couldn't stop eating the pretzel & fondue -- I was afraid I wouldn't have enough room in my tummy for my meal... but of course I would.  And I almost did. The beef stew was so delicious, and even though I was kind of weirded out by the friend egg on top (I know foodies die for that stuff), I gobbled up almost every morsel until my tummy just couldn't hold any more.  And throughout it all, I was sucking on one of their specialty cocktails recommended to me by a coworker -- The Polish Fix.  It was quite good, but very strong, and I was feeling it even with all the food I was eating.  All in all, a great treat for my senses. It is in a great location -- right on the corner of 2nd St. & Jefferson, and if you chose to eat outside in the cooler months, or inside facing the wall of windows, you'll be guaranteed a great people watching opportunity.  I can't wait to go back and try some of their other menu items.  I'm glad I waited, but now I can't get enough of that arrogant butcher!",

I had the Turkey Pastrami sandwich and my wife had the beet salad. I thought the sandwich was cooked perfectly and the fries were hot and crispy. My wife enjoyed the salad but commented that the bowl was too deep and the nuts and dressed stayed on the bottom. We felt the price was right and the atmosphere was great. We look forward to trying other options from the menu.",

It is basically what you always dreamed of when ordering a pretzel and cheese sauce at the ball park - only this time the cheese dip is amazing and flavorful and the pretzel is moist and perfectly warm. For dinner we had the crab stuffed chicken which was very good and the Bolognese with Ricotta Dumplings. This dish was amazingly good - unfortunately it had been removed from the menu for some reason by the time we got back for our second visit.   The second visit was to kill an hour before taking friends to the airport. We got an assortment of beers and appetizers - all were good especially the rock shrimp, the bacon and cheese stuffed potato bites (not the real name) and of course the pretzel fondue again. We sat on the patio and the open atmosphere was great. Highly recommend as a change from the usual fare.",

The restaurant was nearly empty. There were 7 of us with 3 more coming. The host asked if we had reservations, we said no, we'd been at an event & were going to the game.   He said he couldn't seat us as there were others who DID make reservations. (yes, he said it as if it were in CAPS!) We had to ask if the patio (which is huge & has misters) was available - yes. Then we asked if we could have a table inside if we promised to be gone by 5. He reluctantly agreed.  When my wine arrived, there was an insect in it. Our. Waiter was nice & replaced it.  The food was decent - we just had salads & appetizers. I had the Antipasta which was very small, and only came with 2 small pieces of bread. It did come with tart cherry preserves which were great.  A friend had the Tabbouli salad, which was ok, and another had the Salmon Rillette which was good. The food was ok, but nothing to write home about.   When We left promptly at 5, the restaurant was still half empty. I had looked forward to trying this restaurant... but I probably won't go back due to the rude host turning away patrons from an empty restaurant.",

    "text": "Rating this as an \"American (new)\"/bar-grill sort of place, then definitely 5 stars.  Food: well-prepared, and good diversity on the menu without being \"and the kitchen sink.\" I liked that they had rotational items throughout the week, too (I think meatloaf was the night we went) along with chef specials. I went with the night's special of filet with crab, and it was very good.  They even have raw oysters, which were cleaned and prepared very nicely (it's funny, it always seems to me that the fancier seafood-focused places are where they leave them gritty, and places like this place just get them right).  Environment:  Cool vibe, energetic, and well-done lighting/decor.   Service: Special kudos on this front. The servers seemed to really know their stuff, had thoughtful explanations/recommendations, and were knowledgeable about the food they were serving. It appears that management here cares that their staff know what they're selling/serving, so this shows, and they seemed genuinely interested in our experience.  Tip: I'd recommend a reservation, even if you're just reading this and about to walk over from a local hotel. They were fairly busy, and we were a group of five. We had to wait about 15-20 minutes for a table (no problem), but they did ask if we had a reservation when we arrived. But I also don't think it's a problem if you don't have one, just FYI for those that are able.  Opportunity for improvement: I really wish they'd list the abv on their beer listings! With more craft brews and focus on IPA-styles, some can start to get high, so it'd be nice to see at a glance to help plan if 2 or 3 is going to be too many for some.   Thanks!",

Across the bar from me, stands two female servers chatting up a storm, the dark haired one glances over then continues talking apparently blinded by her ridiculous fake eyelashes. The female bartender walks past again as if I wasn't there. There are a total of 2, that's ' two' others at the bar... the place is empty and apparently no one cares about serving a middle aged, balding patron without visible tat's. I could have look past it all if it hadn't happened the last time I was in about 6 mos. ago. It's a shame management doesn't notice. No one in the restaurant would have known any different if I hadn't said something to yet another server blonde and hostess on the way out. To their credit, they were both apologetic... \"let me buy you lunch\".... \"thanks, but I just ate\". Thank god there aren't mirrors in there.",

    "text": "There are restaurants with good food and then there are restaurants with food which makes your day better and your soul happier..The Arrogant Butcher definitely falls in the second category and no, they haven't paid me to write these  superlatives. Their food gives them the right to be arrogant, and yet, the entire staff is so friendly, nice, and accommodating. I had my first and last meal during my Phoenix trip at this place, and they were both beyond great. I went for dinner on a crowded Thursday night and avoided the wait by agreeing to sit on the high chairs near the chef's corner. I had the best scallop dish in my life that night, scallops and snap peas in a brown butter vinaigrette with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes. Yes, you read that right..bacon wrapped sweet potatoes, what a genius combination, my taste buds definitely thanked me profusely. I also had a bowl of seafood chowder which was very different (in a nice way) and tastier than chowders in general.  It was nice to chat with the chefs and watch them in action as I enjoyed my food. They gave me a few samplers too and even brought me a dessert on the house...wish I could give them an extra star for this! The chocolate cake with chantilly cream is such a delight to your senses, it will make you forget all your sorrows for a while, I promise.  Lunch was equally delightful. I had the best jambalaya in the whole wide world and tempted the guy sitting next to me at the bar to give up on his cheeseburger lunch plans and opt for the jambalaya. It was a very generous portion with bold flavors and such a wonderful spice kick. I also tried the salted caramel pudding with cream, and wasn't disappointed a bit.  Five dishes and all five-star dishes without burning too deep a hole in your pocket, so worth it. Please do visit this place and make your reservations ahead of time if you are in the Phoenix downtown area.",

    "text": "Service, service, followed by amazing service.  Here's the scoop.  Arrived Saturday night to a 60 minute wait for a table. Wife did some magic wifey stuff and all of a sudden we were seated at the chef's table on the side where salads and apps are created.  We sat down, and were greeted, immediately by a server with amazing energy and passion for his work.  Efficiently he took our drink orders, made recommendations, and went to acquire the goods.  Next, an equally energetic line cook welcomed us to the restaurant and asked if this was a repeat visit.  No we advised.  He truly beamed with excitement and welcomed us, telling us about how excited he was to have us and started offering us what I expected to be small samples.  At this point, I felt like they thought we were actually important.  As though we were famous, knew someone in their corporate office, etc.  BTW - were just normies.  Wife asked for an off the menu item due to food allergies.  Did they respond?  Yes!!!!  I was able to watch the employee hand cut a head of lettuce, grill it for a moment, hand slice chicken.  He then confirms what the allergens are and asks if he can add more to the salad to make it better for my wife!  He then turns to a line cook to coordinate the timing of the delivery of our food.  I am soooo impressed at this point.  Everyone was getting along, no egos were bruised as the staff (tactfully) hollered to their peers, what they needed.  It was amazing to see the True team work and the fun being had!    Salad - perfect 10.  Turkey Sloppy Joe - 9, just a bit sweet.  Portion of fries served with Sloppy Joe, enough for (4) four adults.    Overall experience?  11 out of 10!  (Or 5/7 for my Imgur peeps).   One the best dining experiences I have ever had.  Made my last $250 dinner at Dominicks feel like a dinner at Chillis.  Two entrees, one draft, one soft drink - including tax, title, license, and docs fees - $40.",

    "text": "So I went here for a featured event. That need to be stated, because it is integral for my conclusion.   As I walked in I felt a good vibe over this place. They have indeed taken a name that screams of some kind of brandishing, but I do not know exactly what. The personnel was nice and quickly showed me where I belonged. This nice approach and courteous behavior stayed with me and my party the whole time.  There was pretzel balls and melted cheese on the table. I am no fan of pretzels and cheese, as many other are, but this fakery of cheese product deserves a mention. It was really tasty, surprisingly so. The pretzel balls was all right, but became a weapon of carboliciousness when paired with this mystical melted cheese product (I say cheese product, because there is no was actual cheese can melt in this fashion).    Then a basic salad, before I had the Sweetpotato Tortellini. It was a small serving of filled pasta that came to my table, but it was worth it. Quite delishious, even if surprisingly sweet. i would eat this again, but not if I was really hungry. But since I started with lots of pretzel balls - it was very adequate.   Dinner warounded of with a Salted Caramel Pudding, and a super lemony Gin and Tonic. The SCP was ok, tasty but as pudding always become blase after a while. It is a delishious dessert that saturates the need for sweets quickly. The lemony Gin and Tonic was refreshing, I am not sure how they made it so lemony (because just adding lime or lemon wouldn't add a subtle sweetness).   So the food was nice, and tasty even if I wasn't blown away by it. What I was blown away by was the service. Our server had many people, and yet was very attentive and super nice. Also working for uncertain tips since it was a featured event. That makes his effort worth much more in my eyes. i would go back, for the food.. but even more for the service. Very nice.",

    "text": "The pretzels and nacho cheese are 2 stars. Supposedly it is provolone fondue but its laughable, I swear I had nacho cheese. I'm from Switzerland and we have great fondue and so does the Citizen Public House in Scottsdale. Phenomenal Fondue and bone marrow butter. We didn't finish the fondue here at the arrogant butcher, and my buddy thought it was disgusting.  The New York Strip is 4 stars but I've had better. The mashed potatoes with reduced wine sauce was alright. Maybe 3.5 stars.  Now my food was a lot of mixed things. I love variety and got the butchers plate for 23 dollars.  My plate with mixed cheese, sliced meat, was alright but not even close to the best. Maybe good jam and mustard and really good devilled eggs but olives and bread was below par.  People are easily satisfied and give it 5 stars. Well I guess I just had really good food before around the world to say this is not bad but I won't go again. If I go to a place and it doesn't knock me of my feet I won't go again. There are too many choices and to be successful you need to be the best or have something special. The only thing special at this place is its name. Now I know why I hate arrogant people or butchers. They think they are better than they really are. Unless you have a lot of people that just don't know better, you might have a chance, which is the case in a lot of cities.",

I could have eaten the entire thing myself! The smoked salmon rillette and the crispy prosciutto deviled eggs were my favorite.  My husband ordered the meatloaf while I ordered the filet mignon. Our friends ordered the BBQ baby back ribs and the Prime rib. I remain partial to my filet, as it was perfectly rare and juicy. My husband's meatloaf was tender and flavorful and the smashed Yukon potato was sooo yummy! The prime rib was tender and the au jus was the most flavorful I've ever tasted. The ribs were also delicious, fall off the bone tender with just enough sauce.  I tried the After School Special, Snakeskin Boots, and Strawberry and Thyme cocktails. My favorite was the Strawberry and Thyme! Well worth the money!  We ended the night by ordering some desserts.  Our friends got the blueberry cheesecake which was so light and fluffy without the density that some cheesecakes have. I ordered the salted caramel pudding. It was heavenly! A grown up version of a dessert I used to enjoy as a child.  The service was friendly and the staff was able to answer all of our questions. It was a modern, trendy vibe without being pretentious or TOO trendy. There was a wide variety of people there, some dressed up and some not. Neither felt out of place. We will certainly be back! In the meantime, I'll be dreaming about that filet mignon...",

Haha! What's also great is that the value is there for the price... the only problem is that we live a bit far from downtown and it's not really worth the 30 minute drive. If you're in the area though... definitely consider it as one of your stops during a night out... !",

We were STARVING so I looked up restaurants close by and The Arrogant Butcher was agreed on by all parties. After wandering aimlessly for parking (damn you Phoenix Suns for having a game) I was able to secure a parking spot and sashayed on over for some eats.   We were greeted and seated immediately. The decor I must say is very different but nice. I was fascinated by their lamp shades. ( I know silly but hey I was) We started out with the crusty bread and olive oil however we had no plates, but we dug in anyway (an let me just say this was some damn good bread) Our waitress was like hmm would you guys like some plates for your bread? Hmm yes please ( ya think) lol  We all ordered something different from the sweet potato tortelli, yum, the turkey sloppy joe, which had a slight kick but not as spicy as you would think, fish and chips, and of course my dish which was black mussels with pommes frites. OMG! My dish was actually on the appetizer menu and let me just say I was in heaven when my dish arrived. It had the most mussels I have have ever had and the fries were just perfect. There were even bits of pork shoulder as well as cloves of garlic throughout the dish. Sweet baby jesus. Now mind you I was full, but I ate every last bit as it was not like I could take any left overs home. I liked it so much that I am contemplating going back ASAP just to have some more, so yes it was that good. A word to the wise, if you order a side of chicken let it be known that it will be a small portion for $4.00. A very small portion. (that is all)  The service was good, the company was freaking fabulous and the food was divine. They even validate parking (thank goodness) so it made it all the better. An all around win in my book.",

We started with the suggested (by waiter) appetizer of pretzels and cheese, and it was a nice start for one order to pass around the table.  We all had salads which we enjoyed, and we must say something about the caramel pudding dessert.  Very good.  Parking was easy (one of us parked on the street, the other in the garage and used validation) and food was good.  However, the two negatives are a bit of a limited menu, and pretty pricey for what we had.  I like a restaurant that doesn't overfeed you, and this one did not ---- but it was on the expensive side for the amount of food we did get.  But then we were in downtown Phoenix (we are usually on the outskirts) so it is probably comparable to other restaurants in the area.  We would go here again.",

Well, they did include a glass of sangria, that I suppose would have put it just over $30, but not everyone likes sangria. So, he ordered off the regular menu. We started with the homemade chips, which I believe are the same ones on the Culinary Dropout menu.  We like them.   He then had the roasted poplano chicken chowder.  He said it was tasty, but wasn't (temp) hot.  Then, after seeing the stew on the cover of Phoenix Mag., he ordered that.  He was quite disappointed.  The egg was overcooked and the stew was bland and it was a very small portion (unlike the picture). I had the prix-fix menu and started with the tabboulleh salad.  It was quite good.  My entree was the crab stuffed chicken.  A little odd and way too much breading on the chicken. I will say, though, the salted caramel pudding was very good.",

The soft pretzel and provolone fondue appetizer was simply amazing. Oysters were tasty, and the filet mignon was cooked perfectly--slightly charred on the outside and rare in the center. All food was excellent. I'm very discriminating with 5 star reviews, but this deserves a high 4 star. Will definitely return here on visits to Downtown Phoenix.",

Alex S. was one of two servers for our group, and my hubby and I felt like we were the only 2 in the party! He was so attentive and very accommodating to everyone in our party...and did it all with a smile and a great, fun attitude!! Love him! The other wait staff was just as wonderful!! What a bonus to the amazing food! The pre-selected menu was deeeelish! Everything served was beautifully prepared, perfect portions, so fresh, so tasty, so delectable! The chef did an AMAZING job! Again, for a large party you don't expect much, but we were so impressed with Arrogant Butcher's stellar service and quality, scrumptious food...we are definitely coming back and spreading the word! Being there for a friend's birthday was special enough, but a BIG THANK YOU to the chef and wait staff (Alex S!!) for making it a pretty incredible dining experience!!",

That being said,  I went to AB last week and was pleasantly surprised.  I love downtown Phoenix and keep hoping it'll start getting more popular down there.  The ambience is great and love the decor.   Boyfriend had fish & chips which I know is hard to mess up but it was honestly the BEST fish & chips I've ever had (better than any I had in England).  I had the swordfish w/ barley.  The swordfish was cooked perfectly and I loved the tiny kick in the seasoning.  The entrees were wonderful, but the best part of the whole meal was the blueberry cheesecake!  It comes in a jar and is not ordinary cheesecake but AB's version is soooooo good.  I wanted another! Service was amazing and food came out in a timely manner.  I don't like when restaurants make their uniforms \"unisex\" because the poor girls always end up looking so manly.  Let the girls wear something a little more flattering!! I have been to several Fox places and I couldn't help but notice a lot of copy-catting from other menus.  My only wish for AB would be that they created more of their own entrees/appetizers.",

    "text": "I checked this place out for brunch on Sunday with some friends before a show at the Herberger. First impression: the space is funky, cool and inviting, and the booths are really comfortable!   The menu reminded me of the menu at Culinary Dropout; American food with a twist! The brunch menu has few breakfast sandwiches, french toast, and some other egg dishes as well as some of the lunch menu. We started off with the Pretzels and Provolone Fondue....I have had it at Culinary Dropout, and it is just as good....warm and comforting. I wasn't really sure what I wanted to eat, but I ended up going with the bacon, egg, cheese and avocado breakfast sandwich...and YUM...I picked well! I have an issue with eggs lots of times, but these were perfect, made even more perfect by being covered in melted cheese, creamy avocado and crisp bacon on a soft, homemade roll. The breakfast potatoes that came on the side were a nice surprise (they weren't listed on the menu) and cooked until golden and crisp. I wish they offered this sandwich 7 days a week, because I would eat it for lunch or dinner anytime!   My friends had the egg white wrap (which she devoured), the French toast that was served with jelly and cream in the cutest little jar and the fruit salad which was mixed with yogurt. We all really enjoyed our food, and the fun cocktails too, I had The Pink Drink....and it was STRONG! The menu also has a cold bar of oysters, lobsters and many other delicious sounding items.   I think this is a cool place and the food is good, but I don't think I would go if I wasn't already going to be downtown for another event because you have to deal with parking in the garage and all that goes with it, and that is just something us AZ people are not fans of. But with that being said, I need to find something to do downtown so that I can visit again soon!",

When your food arrives, it looks good and is well-plated. Then you take a bite. And think, with almost a mental shrug, well, it's pretty good. The edge of disappointment. I don't remember but one thing I ate from either meal. But what I do remember is the gold lining, a delicious dessert version of a peanut butter cup. Warm golden peanut butter pudding of sorts with chocolate sauce. It is an eyes rolling back in your head kind of dessert. Coffee and dessert after a show would be a great option for this restaurant.",

    "text": "I went to one of the soft-opening events for Arrogant Butcher and thoroughly enjoyed the food. The service was a bit hit-and-miss, but that can be forgiven, considering the restaurant hadn't opened to the public and was still ironing out the bugs.  Our party of four shared the mussels and rock shrimp for appetizers. While the shrimp were good (a bit over-fried for my taste, but the remoulade was quite tasty), the mussels were outstanding. The broth was exceptionally flavorful, and the shellfish was cooked perfectly. My only gripe is with the pomme frites included in the bowl -- were they left out, I wouldn't miss them one iota.   For dinner, our table ordered the salmon, the crab-stuffed chicken and the fish & chips, while I dined on the bone-in rib eye. The dry-aged steak was cooked to perfection and served with a delightfully flavorful jus, though there was a large portion of fat and gristle in the steak. The fish portion of my wife's dish was wonderful, while the chips were nothing more than the fries included with the mussels. The cod was cooked to perfection, and was battered in a spicy beer batter that perfectly complimented the very dilly from-scratch tartar sauce. My dining companions raved about the other dishes.  For dessert, we shared the peanut butter cup, which is composed of a warm peanut butter mousse topped with chocolate gelato. It was decadent and quickly devoured by the four of us.  My biggest gripe comes not about the food, but about the service at the bar, where some in my party waited more than 10 minutes prior to being seated for requests as simple as a martini or a draft beer. I also would have liked to see a larger scotch and whiskey selection, but Fox Concepts does score points for having a quite large selection of Arizona beers, both on tap and in bottles.   I will absolutely return.",

Visiting Phoenix we had a great experience at Culinary Dropouts and decided to try this place again. It was a pre lady GaGa show which we weren't aware of so the place was packed. We scored some really good seats by the chef area.... 5 white stools right at the kitchen where they make salads and the pretzel fondue. If you can get these seats grab them!!! I had filet mignon and friends had jumbalaya. Food was excellent. The chefs at our station were non stop busy filling orders for the restaurant yet they gave us a plate with toasted bread, home made jelly and mustard, cheese and their thin sliced meat. I was also given a horseradish sauce for my filet. At the end of the meal out of the blue the salad chef put a desert infront of us before the waiter could even offer it.... We weren't going to order desert but couldn't resist. Staff was super friendly and food was excellent. Been in Phoenix for 10 12 days with only 2 left... Wish we had found this place sooner! Def don't have places like this in NJ/NY.",

There was a wait and we were told they would text us when a table was available. When we received the message our foursome had become separated and I raced in to confirm our table and request a moment to retrieve our gang. I was told by an unnamed female assistant at the receiving station that we would be seated or next in line when I returned with my crew. When we presented to Rachel within 10 minutes she told us we missed our table and we would need to get back in the queue. When I pleaded my case about waiting, texting and gatherings my party she just shrugged with a sarcastic smile and told me that it was their policy to sacrifice our position if we were tardy. And she claimed that she had just sent her assistant home and therefore unable to confirm my claim. I politely encouraged Rachel to examine their texting history to see when we were contacted. My suggestion was not appreciated and we told again by the unfriendly Rachel that we would just have to get back on the wait list. No apology. No smile. I sure hope that Rachel was more polite to the Alabama and Clemson visitors. We left the neighborhood to dine at the culinary dropout where we spent our cash.",

    "text": "A nice place for happy hour!  After watching a lovely show at The Orpheum, we were feeling quite peckish, so we headed over to partake in the discounted delectables that The Arrogant Butcher had to offer.  I also just wanted to eat here because I dig the name Arrogant Butcher. From 3-6 PM they offer appetizers such as pretzels with cheese fondue ($5), fried shrimp with shishito peppers ($8), and artichoke hummus ($8).  They also have a decent selection of mixed drinks, wine, and beer at a reasonable price for happy hour.  We indulged in all the appetizers described above, and left with full and satisfied stomachs.  The pretzels came in a big basket, and are pretty much like the pretzels you will find at Culinary Dropout.  They are fairly large, doughy nuggets, and go well with the cheese fondue (It tasted like some type of cheddar concoction). The fondue was good, but a little grainy.  The shrimp were nicely cooked, and had a nice tender texture to go with the crunch of the light batter.  The shishito peppers were good as well, and were mild in heat.  The hummus was a very nice presentation, and had a wonderful array of textures and flavors, from the smooth, almost creamy hummus, to the pieces of artichoke, olive, tomato, and sweet red pepper.  The pita bread that was served with it was grilled, with a pillowy center.    Service was decent and drinks were refilled as needed.  Definitely a good spot to eat at if you're in the downtown area.",

    "text": "Our menu so far: house made pretzels and provolone fondue, sweet potato tortelli, roasted beet salad, montchevre (goat Brie), chicken stroganoff, smoked pork Cubano, turkey pastrami, French fries, a kids grilled ham and cheese sandwich, a kids chicken tenders, the \"hot chocolate\" cake, and pumpkin cheesecake with pomegranate compote.   Pretzels: yes, just get them. Perfectly cooked and brined, and that provolone has a flavor something of magic. If you can't go for some German bread paired with Swiss/Italian/French melted cheese, well, that's just un-American.   Montchevre: still not a fan of goat cheese. My friend liked it quite well, however.   Roasted beet salad: surprisingly amazing!  I'm not a huge food risk taker, but I do consider myself a foodie, and I'm trying to take more risks with my palette. This was just perfectly combined: roasted beet for a base (first time eating beets, do it here. It was mine, too), Brussel sprouts for depth, pistachios for crunch, prosciutto and accompany sauce for flavor and pomegranates for balance. Seriously, so well dreamed up. I'll definitely be getting it again.   Sweet potato tortelli: not usually a huge sweet potato fan, but I also really loved this. The mushroom and spinach balanced the sweet potato along with the lemon butter type sauce.  The hazelnuts added a touch of flare and texture. So good!  Cubano: such an interesting sandwich with deli thin ham slices alongside smoked pork, topped in a cheddar cheese, (usually Swiss), and had a bit of a kick in flavor. Served in a sturdy folded bread like a panini, I'd say. It was good, but compared to the other items we've had, it's a little forgettable.   Turkey pastrami: that's what good turkey tastes like. First time trying it as a pastrami, but had same flavoring without feeling heavy. The coleslaw was crunchy and had a great sauce inside. The pretzel bun was perfectly portioned not to overwhelm the sandwich. Suggest eating it upside down to allow the ingredients to soak into the top bun as well. Supposedly their best selling sandwich, and I'd have to say, I'm not surprised and would definitely order it again.   Stroganoff: the handmade egg noodles were brilliantly made and perfectly cooked al dente.  The peas tasted fresh and added a little sweetness to a savory dish. The chicken was so tender and flavorful. Never had a chicken stroganoff, but once again the bird made it feel like a lighter meal without sacrificing the savory element you expect from a stroganoff. Just enough sauce, not swimming. Filled with mushrooms - great flavor.   Grilled ham and cheese and chicken tenders - predictable, but well received by the kiddos.   Fries: sandwiches both came with it - wasn't expecting that. Awesome crisp with soft and airy interior. Cooked in truffle oil?  Something, because they had a different, but yummy flavor.   \"Hot chocolate\" cake: made Swiss miss hot cocoa. Pictures something sweet, but it was more of a rich chocolate cake. Almost a brownie flavor with more of a lighter texture (oddly enough, like a soggy cake texture, but in a good way).   Cheesecake: who would have thought pumpkin with pomegranate, but that should just be a permanent thing, since it works so darn well. The cheesecake was lighter and fluffier than a traditional cheesecake, but still good. Topped with a pomegranate seed compote - so good. Finished with some granola style crumble - again, so good. Winter seasonal dessert - switches to blueberry in the summer months.   Desserts are $6 and are on the smaller side, but still enough to share and portioned in a size that even after a meal, you can make room to share one or a couple.   Will be trying the warm peanut butter cup (should have fought harder to try that) and salted caramel pudding in a few weeks (voted best dessert in Phoenix recently).   Definitely a new favorite for when we find ourselves in town.",

The tabbouli salad was nothing like typical middle eastern tabbouli (still not sure why they called it that) but it was good and flavorful. The portion of the salad was huge and I was able to share it with the entire table. For entree, I ordered the crab stuffed chicken. To me, it was a little dry and the flavors weren't amazing. My husband ordered the scallops on the regular menu and although the portion was a nice size, he didn't care for the flavor. His dish came with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes and green beans, which I thought were the best part. The salted caramel pudding dessert was by far my favorite part of the dining experience and I would definitely come back for that again. Apparently it has won awards over the years.  Overall, I thought this place was just okay. I know this is a Fox restaurant but I prefer the food and upbeat environment at Culinary Dropout (Tempe).",

    "text": "11/29/12  3.5 stars... First visit!  Bookmarked this place months ago, and I finally had an excuse to make the trip from North Scottsdale... I'm taking Mom and aunt to see Cirque du Soleil's \"Dralion\" at the US Airways Center!  Thanks to friend and fellow yelper Dolores G.'s helpful info on where to park, I made the decision to choose Cityscape for both the chance to dine at The Arrogant Butcher and have my ticket validated AND take advantage of its proximity to the arena.  She wasn't kidding when she said that US Airways was across the street!  After waiting about 20 or so minutes for first availability, we were seated outside, and my views were of the four-way intersections, pedestrian traffic, and of the front of the arena, which were lovely given that most of my dining experiences have been in strip malls, Old Town Scottsdale, the Biltmore... suburbia.    I was able to sample a couple of reds before settling with a nice glass of Sebastiani cab from Sonoma.  While waiting for our table, we all decided we'd try the Artichoke hummus app <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=pMVWRf_4YH3y8gA7yX4NfQ#pMVWRf_4YH3y8gA7yX4NfQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh...</a>, the Market salad <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=p8euqv1jrWI3dHs6F8Qw8Q#p8euqv1jrWI3dHs6F8Qw8Q\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh...</a>, the Beef short rib stew <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=M50fqAft6N-pxOxsrjgaQA#M50fqAft6N-pxOxsrjgaQA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh...</a>, and the \"Fish and Chips.\"  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh5SO-7wr8HPpVCDPbXQ?select=aaSSAu-_xck3KUofcyT-hA#aaSSAu-_xck3KUofcyT-hA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/yNPh...</a>  We all loved the artichoke hummus and pita bread app!  The bread was soft, yet had a nice chew, in spite of it not being warm and crispy.  The artichokes had great flavor, especially those that were touching the tomatoes.  We also adored the Market salad, which had so many textures to delight the mouth: mixed grains, chewy cranberries, sweet and crunchy gingersnaps, and creamy ricotta... Mmmm!  Loved the almost-nutty bite of the roasted butternut squash.  I plan to order this again on my next visit!    We also really liked the Beef short rib stew: I liked the smoky flavors of the beef and the green chile peppers, but my favorite were the beans!  Some were still chunky, while the others had tenderized down to almost like a dip you spread on crackers and crostini.  I didn't think the fried egg's presence made much of a difference...  I could take it, or leave it.  Since I couldn't sample the cornbread muffin (allergy), I had some of the fries from the fish entree with the stew, instead.  Mom and aunt enjoyed the crispy fish!  I really loved the batter, which was just the perfect amount to cover the fish and give it a very delightful crunch (and was the dish ever so pretty to look at!).  However, I found the pieces to be very salty, and I couldn't stand more than two or three bites of it.    I think my Mom would very much like to return, and so would I.  :)  I am going to try to make it here earlier for happy hour soon.  I really appreciate the location of Cityscape, its parking garage, and its easy access to many restaurants, shops, and entertainment venues!",

    "text": "Okay my wife and I visited last night sans kids for an adult dinner with drinks.  Started with an old fashioned which was pretty good even though I prefer mine a little less sweet.  My wife and I settled on oysters and shrimp for the starter.  The oysters were as fresh as if we were actually somewhere off the east coast where they came from off Long Island.  The giant prawn were great and meaty.  Fresh horse radish and separate cocktail sauce was nice but they added this third sauce that was supper tasty as well and I couldn't put my finger on it but it was delicious.  Finally for dinner my wife chose the scallops and I chose the jambalaya.  My server helped me navigate as I couldn't decide between that and the braised short rib stew.  But since I told him I was starving and preferred a larger dish we went with it.  Next time I'll try the stew.  The scallops were perfect.  The server actually told us the chef vetoed the first batch as they were slightly over cooked which takes me to the three ***.  Before that my jambalaya was super flavorful.  He advised it was 8 of 10 on heat index and I would put it about 6 but I have higher tolerance than many.  Okay the 3 stars is because it took sooooo long, 30 minutes, to get raw oysters and cold shrimp.  Granted the manager advised the seafood guy had to shuck 80 oysters.  Next it took forever to get the entrees which above I said the server advised that the scallops had to be redone.  This was what appeared to be an average Saturday night.  The wait was about 5 minutes although we had reservations.    Lastly our server was top notch.  Knew the menu cold and had great descriptions about and opinions of every dish.  This guys has to be one of their best.  I was a little disappointed when the restaurant forgave nearly half the menu of the couple next to us for their inconvenience but didn't even offer us a free dessert.  I guess not complaining and being pleasant has its limitations as it appeared the server and manager recognized the delayed service therefore no need to chatter about it or complain.  Squeaky wheel gets the grease!  Regardless we will be back.  Great food,  good atmosphere and hopefully the kitchen will be more organized next time.",

    "text": "We were a large group on a busy Saturday night. They didn't have a reservation available for our group, but some smooth talking and a tip got us a table.  We had a personable (and cute) waiter who was happy to go through the menu and make recommendations. He also wanted to make sure that we weren't in a hurry. We weren't (which turned out to be a good thing).  I started with the \"Old Old Fashioned\" cocktail ($11), a very traditional blend of Angel's Envy Reserve bourbon and angostura with orange and lemon peel. Other tried \"The Pink Drink\" ($9) -- vodka, grand mariner, lemon sour, and cranberry bitters -- which was pronounced \"quite sweet.\" The Arrogant 85 ($9) was a surprisingly refreshing combination of gin, aperol, St. Germain, and sparkling wine, served in a champagne glass. It was a nice combination for a warm Phoenix evening.  On the appetizers menu, we tried the house soft pretzels and provolone fondue ($10)  -- round-shaped pretzel bread to dip into the smooth, rich cheese sauce that were a hit with everyone at the table. The zucchini fritters ($8) were light and fluffy and the parmesan aioli was a perfect salty/creamy addition.  My entree was the beef short rib stew ($18), made with plenty of green chiles and white beans, served with a knob of cornbread for crumbling into the spicy, flavorful broth. The stew was topped with a fried egg which added creaminess and texture into the stew.  My sweetie got the Sweet Potato Tortelli ($15), made with mushrooms, spinach, and hazelnuts in a butter sauce. He added a blacked chicken breast to make it a hearty, rich meal.  Other favorites at the table were the scallops ($25), served with bacon-wrapped sweet potato, peas, and marcona almonds in a brown butter vinaigrette, a petite portion but full of flavor. The steaks ($36 for the filet and $35 for the New York Strip) were prepared traditionally and given a thumbs-up.  The warm peanut butter cup dessert ($6) was almost a sweet peanut butter soup, served with a scoop of chocolate gelato in the center of the bowl with two cookies alongside. The Salted Caramel pudding ($6) was ridiculously rich and delicious...and tasted of nothing but salted caramel. Fabulous.  The service was friendly throughout and our waiter was even able to handle separate checks on the big group. That said, it was an hour from the time we were seated until our entrees came out -- clearly the kitchen was having some difficulties. But our waiter did warn us of this up front...and when our food did arrive, it was all warm and delicious.  I'm happy to recommend this as a great spot in downtown Phoenix. Just don't go if you're in a hurry.",

    "text": "I don't get it. First time at the Arrogant Butcher and was not impressed. I feel like it's a trendier version of Chile's. I guess my mistake was ordering the scallops instead of something easier and more mainstream like pasta or a burger. I even asked about the scallops and how they were and waitress assured me they were great. They were nearly inedible and I only ate about half of a very tiny plate. They came with very old, wilted, yellowed parsley on top that I would've thrown away had it been in my fridge. The scallops came with bacon wrapped sweet potatoes which were SO SALTY and made the whole dish very unbalanced. It just is the wrong combination for scallops, and was a huge expensive fail. I probably should've sent it back, but I just wanted to get out of there and go home after a long week.   I tasted my husband's fries and they were disgusting! They tasted stale and old, and just plain nasty. Probably the worst fries I've ever tasted. My daughter's mushroom pasta was very nice though, and I dipped my scallops into her leftover cream mushroom sauce so that I didn't leave hungry.  The Laguna Chardonnay was really nice though, and not sure I've had it before. Service was ok in terms of speed, but I didn't encounter anyone particularly friendly. Not rude, just not welcoming.   We were considering having a large company holiday event here, but it's off the list now as I would not trust the food quality.",

He insisted on having a drink, and when they wouldn't serve him, he lost it.  He pulled a bottle of 151 out of his pocket, slammed it, and smashed the empty bottle on the floor.

It cost $18 for a little portion and one corn cake.  I would rate the price here as $$$ instead of $$ because it is very pricey, as expected from a location in downtown Phoenix. I'd say the beef stew I ordered tasted like one I can get for $5 in a super market. It didn't have a lot of meat I also ordered a blueberry cheesecake. Its texture is soft, like pudding, than cheesecake, $7. My price range for this would have been $5 or less because it wasn't big either.  The CitySpace E Parking Garage right next to the rest, opposite of the big parking lot, is free for 2 hours. Just give the host the pass and they'll validate it for you.

My girlfriend and I went there about a month back and ordered some oysters on the half shell and their Butcher's Platter which was a nice meat and cheese charcuterie platter. It was her first time trying oysters on the half shell and they were great! I've had their cioppino, which while pretty good, isn't as good as I used to get in the Bay Area. Their green chili stew is also very good. The waitress even recommended some other spots when we told her we were looking for some funky places that had interesting menus.",

Made a reservation on the way to the restaurant just in case it was super busy (there was a Suns game) and were seated right away, even though our entire party wasn't there so that was also a plus. Cons: Oyster shells in the shucked oysters - sent them back.  The manager came over and apologized so that was nice. Dry burger - ordered it medium, came out well done. Wrong beers delivered second round.   Not a great experience. I had been wanting to go for awhile so at least I can say I did, and won't be back.",

    "text": "I was in Phoenix about 2 years ago and remembered locals telling me about this place. Unfortuantely I didn't have enough time to go so I vowed the next time I was in Phoenix, I would have a steak at The Arrogan Butcher.    My husband and I drove into town from San Diego to attend the LA Rams and Cardinals game (we are ex Chargers fans!).  The filet was the MOSTS AMAZING filet I have ever had and that is saying a lot because I have had my fair share of filets.  It was unbelievable.  My husband had the salmon which unfortunately wasn't as great as my filet (too dry).  The atmosphere was great, acoustics were perfect and they had the football game.    My only complaint is that the service was slow.  Our drinks were late getting to the table and I should never have to ask for a refill.  That need should be anticipated by the waiter/waitress. I didn't notice any type of sense of urgency with the wait staff (definitely with my waitress although she was a very sweet young lady).  They just need move it a bit faster and be more proactive and this place would be top notch.",

The \"baked\" pasta dish, which mind you was the ONLY pasta dish, had no characteristics of baked pasta. Sauce taste like a canned selection. Burger was completely over cooked. Tasting bitter and burnt. Just dissatisfied for the cost of the bill. Also our waitress Meagan seemed disinterested, and crass. As if she was burdened with servicing us. At one point she brought up the festival we were at only to boast about a cocktail feature in which none of us even knew. Save your money. Save your time.",

    "text": "What do you do when you only have one evening, basically enough time for dinner and drinks in Phoenix before taking off for an early morning flight? You make the best of your first time in town and scroll through Yelp to help you find good food and drinks!  Hubby and I are notorious \"small plates/tapas kind-a-people\" so when I came across this place I could tell from looking at the pictures, this place would be right up our alley. The place is huge so take your pick! We chose to belly up to the bar and start the night off with a few cocktails. And, seriously, what's more fun than getting served by a Jake Gyllenhaal's doppelganger?? Okay, I'll admit it was more fun for me, than for hubby, but he couldn't deny this guy was his identical twin separated at birth.   We decided on ordering a charcuterie board (aka Butcher's platter $24) because that's our jam. It was the chef's daily favorites and while it was different, it was good minus the blue cheese.We enjoyed the spin on it with the deviled eggs, corn cake muffins, pistachios, and bacon wrapped sweet potato bites.   The cocktails we had were all very good. Prices ranged from $11-12 bucks which is about average for hand crafted drinks. They also have a variety of beers on tap as well as bottle/canned beer too.  The rest of the menu looked appetizing as well with dishes ranging from meatloaf, salads, stews, fish, burgers and a raw bar too!   Overall, who wouldn't like sitting in a hipster bar being served cocktails and appetizers by Jake Gyllenhaal? Ok, well don't ask my husband, but take it from me, I'd definitely go back if in Phoenix again and well, of course try more of their dishes and (probably) sit in the dining area! No, just kidding of course at the bar!",

It was on my book mark list a while with so much talk of it and enticing pictures and when I finally went, it was a big ol flop.  Our server was nice enough. We sat outside since the weather was nice on a Sat afternoon.  Our party of 4 was ready for lunch and we happily ordered what sounded like great food choices. Jambalaya, Meatloaf, fish and chips and the French Dip. I personally had the fish and chips and they were very tasty, the rest of the dishes were very middle of the bar, nothing impressive, nothing to write home about, nothing to crave another day.   The meatloaf, I tell ya, was squishy, wet and so bland... She had to send it back, it was very unappetizing.  I would say the portions were stingy. There were maybe 7 green beans on top of the meatloaf? My bowl for the yummy fish and chips dip was not even filled, just a little squirt in the tiny condiment cup. When I asked for more of it, I got the same miniscule squirt in another condiment cup. Sigh. The price of food relative to the deliciousness and quantity was very askew.  I love Fox RC, I frequent CD so very often and a few others.. This one is clearly not one I'll venture that far to revisit. There are so many other places to try nearby before I would want to go back. Sorry, it's the truth.",

The wait was a little longer than estimated (20 actual minutes, rather than 10)...but that was the only small drawback on a very good experience. Cocktails are well mixed, with some creative options. Entrees were solid. Fish and chips featured good cuts of fish, well battered and fried without a greasy finish. The jambalaya was interesting...a tad drier than many settings, but well-sourced and on point in seasoning. Server recognized our pressing event, and made sure we were kept on schedule and well cared for.",

Lots of places to sit, reservations are welcome but not necessary for lunch, at tables and booths and the bar. Open kitchen, outside seating.   Service was impeccable. Friendly, efficient and fast.  This is definitely a well run establishment with fresh ingredients and a well thought out menu. We'll be back.  On vacation it's easy to let your phone run down with pics and social media posts.

My husband and I enjoyed the Butcher's Platter with its wide assortment of meats, cheese, and everything in between. It's definitely worth the money ($24) as it is quite filling. We liked it so much we wouldn't think twice about ordering it again in the future. We also tried the buffalo chicken thighs from the happy hour menu. While it was tasty, we would have preferred a crispier texture to the chicken. The Fix and the Mule are delightful cocktails on the happy hour menu. Refreshing and strong...one of my favorite combos for cocktails. Our waitress, Amber, was super friendly and helpful too. If you're in the area, definitely check this place out.",

The food is filled with so much flavor, and while they may not seem to have a lot of dinner options, it's for a reason. They seem to put so much thought into what they do serve and it's perfect, they don't miss a thing. We had the spinach dip to start and the cheese didn't harden what so ever, stayed really soft and gooey. Then for dinner we had the Diver Scallops, and Crispy Chicken Beast. The Crispy Chicken Breast is much newer on the menu, and it was our favorite! Really juicy.   As far as service we got greeted by a gal, then a guy came to ask if we were ready and took our order. We assumed we got a new server it was kinda awk would have been nice for the original server to let us know and not make us feel that she didn't want us. Then our food items came out by other servers and finally we see our server a second time. Finally a different gal comes and cashes ya out. Then again see our server a third time. We practically met the entire staff. It wasn't a personal dining experience like most places should be. Next time we'll sit at the bar because at least we are coming back for the food and a new experience!",

    "text": "Came here several times for lunch with my coworkers. Parking is limited (most visitors would need to park at the East CityScape garage), but the service and quality of food is pretty good here.  Ambience is nice, and definitely gets crowded by lunch time. Luckily I made a reservation ahead of time and was promptly seated with the party. Once everyone got seated and placed their order, the food came out within 15-20 minutes which is perfect as it gave my coworkers ample time to socialize.  The pretzels and cheese is amazing, as well as the artichoke dip for appetizers. Then for the meal I ordered the Prime Rib French Dip sandwich, with provolone and horseradish served with au jus on the side for dipping.  Overall, I think this is one of the best sandwich restaurant in the downtown Phoenix area that you should check out whenever you're nearby.",

Within 2 seconds flat, Bartender Brittany (who rocks - but I digress) has a menu and a glass of water in front of me. Major bonus points.    Menu looks good - enough variety but not SO much that you know nothing will be very good.  Hmmm - locally brewed draught Scottish Ale - 20 Oz , $7.50.  Nice.  Crispy prosciutto deviled egg starter - $3 and awesome.  Grilled asparagus starter - served perfectly parboiled and grilled and chilled - awesome on a 110 degree day.  $3.  Double awesome.  Debated about scallops (which are highly recommended) vs beef rib stew vs jambalaya. Went with the stew - a solid 3.5 out of 5 with a side of cornbread with butter that was out of the park 5x5.  Perfect.  Ideally, My perfect stew is drier and chunkier - if you like \"broth-ier\" than you will rate it higher.  Great atmosphere, lots of fun people, plenty of sports on the big screens - and honestly, Brittany was a highlight.  Funny, personable, and enthusiastic about her restaurant.  5x5, Brittany, and someone owes you a raise.  Thank you for making my first visit memorable.  Visit, eat, have an ice cold draught beer.  Say hello to Brittany and tell her more people should be like her.  It would be a better world.",

    "text": "Went back to the Arrogant Butcher today with my parents, significant other, and his parents. I am dropping down my review from 5-4 for a couple of reasons.  With that said, this is still a great place to have a consistently good meal with options that will please most people.  Here are the reasons why I am dropping down the review:  1. Service:  Last time we went, it was Valentine's Day, so there was an excuse for the slow service. This time, it was 1 PM on a Saturday and the place was at 1/3 of capacity. Drinks took close to 15 minutes to arrive, and the food took about 25. Luckily we weren't rushed on time or anything, so it wasn't a problem, but I just think they could have better service.  2. Portion size: I ordered the salad this time, and have to say that this salad was ridiculously small for being an $11 salad. I would not recommend people to get the salads because of how small it was.  3. Expensive: Last time, we didn't spare any expense because it was Valentine's Day. This time, the bill really slapped us in the face. With drinks and food it was over $250 for 6 people. Just a bit expensive for the quality of food and service.  Overall, it's not a bad spot, but it was not as good as it seemed this time!  If they want to improve, then they should have more efficient service, have larger portions, and have more quality food for the price they charge!",

    "text": "Came here a couple of times but the review below is based on most recent experience.   On Valentine's Day, we decided on arrogant butcher for dinner. Made a reservation so was able to get in and seated pretty quickly. As usual this place was crowded so reservation is definitely recommended especially if you have a bigger group.   Ordered rigatoni, buffalo boneless chicken, and scallop. All were mediocre. Rigatoni was covered in excessive layer of cheese and SUPER salty overall. Chicken was average - the flavor was there but the meat had a weird texture. Scallop was overpriced with only 5 pieces for the serving.   The service was all over the place that night probably due to how busy and hectic it was. One server kept coming up to our table with food that we didn't order or came by with another plate of buffalo chicken.   Park in the garage in the same building structure. Restaurant will validate.",

It's located in the downtown area of Phoenix and very easy to get to via Uber. We were dropped off right out front. Upon entering you can see that the place was very open. There was dining outside and inside, along with a bar. It was early Friday evening and we got in easily. There were others dining but it wasn't super crowded.   Already knowing we wanted the pretzels with fondue, we went ahead and ordered that while we looked through the menu. I decided to go with the sweet potato enchiladas with beans and my husband ordered the fish tacos. My daughter ordered from the kid menu and went with the always faithful, chicken and fries. I absolutely loved my enchiladas, they were sweet and savory at the same time with an excellent sauce! The beans were a little salty but so good that I pretty much ate them all. The pretzel rolls and fondue were the problem. Not necessarily in a bad way. We just enjoyed them a little too much that we were full before our food came out, so that's why we couldn't do dessert...darn! But seriously they come with around 10 pretzels and with the cheese...heaven. The kids chicken was quite massive so we brought them back to the hotel and apparently they reheat nicely.  The decor inside is nice and our service was great. I",

Also, the plate was small. Only wish I was local to give the arrogant butcher a chance to redeem himself.",

That was my dinner and I was pretty full afterwards. It was really busy but luckily we made reservations before hand. The waiter we had was very friendly and was helpful with my coworker's dietary restrictions. The following day I had the file mignon and smashed potato. It was good but I'm not sure I'd get it again. I'd probably went to try something new. I was acutally hungry after I finished this meal and was a bit disappointed because it was definitely on the expensive side of the menu. If the plate had an additional side I think it would have been a bit more memorable. I actually was more happy about the nachos that cost $10 than the steak that almost cost $50.

After the first review I wrote last week about a not so stellar experience, I was contacted by them and allowed them to contact me to discuss.  The General Manager, Peter, was very apologetic and asked if we would be willing to come back on a credit of what we originally spent and let them try again.  We graciously accepted and worked out a convenient time to return - which was last night, just 8 days after our original visit.  Everything about the 2nd experience was different.  We were given brand new menus (no food stains or rips.  We were met by the General Manager shortly after being seated and welcomed back and appreciated for giving them a 2nd chance.   The server was very knowledgeable about the menu - asked us on a few different occasions if we had any questions, and when we did explained the food choices in detail.  He was virtually always present and available, yet he had several other tables in the area he was also attending to - which he seemed to be giving everyone the same excellent service we were receiving - nice to see.  We ordered the soft pretzels and provolone fondue as a appetizer - definitely enough of an appetizer for like 4 people - we ended up not eating all the pretzels to save some room for our entrees - which were exceptional.  One of us ordered the filet mignon which was cooked to perfection.  The other of us ordered the crab stuffed chicken and I can't stop raving about it.  In addition to the exceptional service the waiter provided, Peter also checked in with us from time to time and repeatedly thanked us for giving them another opportunity.    Must have been an off night the first time - which happens, but what speaks volumes is how Peter and his team \"made it right\".  Also, he comped the entire meal, which was greater in price than our original - not expected, but very much appreciated.  Thanks Peter and Arrogant Butcher - we are now fans!!",

    "text": "I have very mixed feelings about the Arrogant Butcher. Four visits on varying occasions have each resulted in different experiences and levels of satisfaction. I love the atmosphere and the overall experience, but the lack of consistency is noticeable and I have heard similar criticisms from friends.   My first trip to AB was for drinks and a snack during a break from a sporting event downtown. I went over alone (to escape) ordered a Manhattan and an appetizer. The Manhattans were perfect (who stops at one?), and the charcuterie and cheese were terrific and served with some unique accoutrements. However, it was some time before I was able to order that first drink, and in fact, almost left after waiting at the bar for quite some time without acknowledgement - and there were only about 5 other patrons nearby. Once I did get someone's attention, everything was brilliant, but I can never understand a bartender not promptly taking a drink order.  My succeeding trip was very similar to the first, waited at the bar with a friend for an inordinate amount of time before finally having our drink and order of cheese and some appetizers taken. The restaurant was not particularly busy and the bar staff was sort of milling around chatting rather than trying to make money by serving the two thirsty girls in front of them. Once we had our (very well crafted) beverages in hand, everything went swimmingly. This place does a stand out job of mixology and the bartenders, while less than attentive, do know how to make a great drink.   Third visit - dinner date (no worries boys, it didn't go that well): Service was wonderful in the restaurant and I wish I could recall the waiter's name. We ordered a couple appetizers again went for charcuterie and cheese. The stand out for me was the pate - then again, I am always a sucker for pate. My dinner date had a steak and I had the sweet potato tortellini, which was simply wonderful.   Fourth visit - birthday party for ten. This was again a super mixed experience. The restaurant seated us in a private room in the back, which was decorated with some very cool photos of Phoenicianicana. I was a little late in arriving so the crew had already devoured several appetizers and a plethora of oysters. From what I heard the mussels were a big hit and they liked the cheese plate as much as I did. The waiter was super nice, answered questions, took our orders and kept everyone's glass full.   Dinner was a bit of a mess. Two of the guys ordered steaks with the $18 crab add on for a surf and turf, one filet and one rib eye, both of which came out overcooked. One of the gals ordered the crab, and the waiter came and explained it had 'fallen apart' so they were bringing a new one. They did fix the errors, but it is ever so awkward to have part of your party finished with dinner while others are waiting on theirs to show up. I ordered the scallops and they were perfectly cooked, but I had to bite through sand in about half of them, which is just a bummer. After we'd already had so many issues I didn't want to add to the aggravation in sending something else back to the kitchen.   The GM did come see us, apologized and brought out a round of deserts. In a nice effort he brought two of each of the four desserts on the menu, which we all tried out. The stand out for me was the salted caramel pudding. No one really understood the warm peanut butter gelato, which essentially tasted like peanut butter soup. We were having a good time and we did appreciate the manager and waiter's efforts to apologize and take care of the issues.  The Arrogant Butcher has a pretty sweet little happy hour menu and now that my office is now less than ten minutes away, I will probably be stopping back in to check that out and am certain I will eat here again. I just wish they could regularly be as great as I know they can be.",

They were the best we've ever had! Our sandwiches were tasty and proportions just the right size. Loved everything! Everyone should give this place a try when downtown.

    "text": "We went there twice on a 5 day trip to Phoenix. Loved it so much the first time we wanted to go back two days later. We are really big fans of True Food Kitchen, a sister restaurant and we were not disappointed - even with the highest of expectations. We had the Kale Salad, Rock Shrimp Pasta, Pretzel Bread Fondu, Sweet Potato Tortelli, the Seabass and the Peanut Butter Cup for dessert.  (Remember, we were there twice!). The food was soooo incredible. I don't think I could choose a favorite. They are all that good.   They have a great bar with a well stocked selection of beers, wines and liquor (at least I noticed my favorite; Maker's Mark).   The service is just as good. We sat down right at our reserved time (on a Saturday night) and were greeted by the most personable waitress. Cute, bubbly, friendly and knowledgable. She took our drink order and told us our waiter would be with us right away (which he was). A little disappointed that she (Melissa) wasn't going to be serving us, but our waiter was great.   A bit later, Peter, the GM, came up and thanked us for coming in and wanted our feedback. Actually said my wife's name and our last name. Really made us feel like welcomed regulars.   The only problem we have with the Arrogant Butcher is that we don't have one in Southern California.  I hope that changes soon.",

    "text": "I promised my boyfriend I would start this review out with the truth.... So get this, we are in our way to the \"yelp party\" in downtown Phoenix. Halfway there I'm all \"Sooo what exactly did I say? Did I tell you it was tonight? Oooor\" and he looks at me with that what did you do face. \"Wellllllll, it's next week. Next Saturday. The 15th. No, the 17th. Wait Thursday. Yeh it's next Thursday\" So that's how that went and he was adamant that I should tell the yelp community I made a booboo. So Thursday he slept thru our date night, no big deal. We are on our way and I have a list or restaurants in downtown I want to go to cause I never go there. Arrogant butcher, done, no game right now, perfect.  Park, with harassment from a homeless man who saved me five dollars then asked for the five dollars he just saved me. Get a seat outside immediately. We were greeted by Pauliee. So we've had some weird waiters recently. Not this guy. Please give him to us each time. We ordered the pretzels and fondue. Even the boy I spoke of fondly earlier, who dislikes cheese, agreed that this was good! Too big for two people though, I wish they would cut it down and charge less.  Let me mention here...I love lemonade. But like the homemade sort. There is nothing I despise more than that drink minute maid tries to pass of as lemonade when it's really just a piss colored drink that tastes like nickels have been dropped in it with a squeeze of lemon. This lemonade was wonderfully homemade. And I got a refill. I died when he brought me a refill (not actually thank god). I was rationing myself then realized that and started guzzling.  Anyhow. They were out of the fried chicken. So sad. Which they didn't plan but good marketing because I will be back for it. I ordered the short rib stew with green chiles, fried egg and what I think was green chile or jalapeno cornbread. It was all sooo good. Lift up the cornbread, it weighs 10 pounds. I took home the leftovers and had enough for two more meals. Part fault of those pretzels. Man friend ordered steak over the succotash. It came sliced, unusual but great. He didn't want the horseradish. How is he my boyfriend? That would have made it so good.  A+++ on food, drinks and service. Pauliee if you ever read this, I hope that's your name...I'm sorry we were weird and talked to you about things you definitely didn't care about. But thanks for seeming genuinely interest haha, we rarely get such good waitstaff. Keep it up!",

    "text": "Straightforward and just plain good.  We popped in to get a quick burger before walking the the Crescent Ballroom which is about five short city blocks away.  You can easily take the light rail here by getting off at the station that is just east of Central.   The wife and I each had a burger, I had a local beer and she had a Hendricks Gin martini.  We sat at the bar and had great service from the bartender who was attentive, but not too into our business.  We had a night of drinking ahead, and he kept our water glasses full at every turn, which is something any good bartender should do instead of only focusing on the alcohol.    When ordering the burgers, the only choice was the side (fries, coleslaw or side salad).  So not cooked to order, just cooked.  We liked the simplicity.  I had the side salad, which just came tossed with a house vinaigrette that was great.  While I was surprised that I wasn't offered a choice of dressing, I liked that I didn't have to give a bunch of specifics-- I loved just ordering the burger and not having to make a bunch of choices.   I am the type of customer that like to experience the food as the cook/chef decides to put it together.  I am not picky and often find that leaving those decisions to the chef make it more fun for me.    The place is very clean, and the kitchen is open-air, right in the middle of the restaurant.  You can watch as they prepare every item.  Everything was priced reasonably.  The special was prime rib at $25 a plate.  The burgers we had were $10 each, the beer was under $6, and the Hendricks martini, which was basically a double was $13.50.  All well worth it for the quality.  The burgers were fantastic and the fries were fresh cut and crispy.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try The Arrogant Butcher since they opened and finally had the opportunity when I found myself downtown with a group of friends the Saturday of Memorial Day weekend.  Since were a large group and wanted to sit in the bar area to take advantage of happy hour prices we ended up waiting a long time for a table (approx. 45 min). So, we were already annoyed and extremely hungry. Not a good start. Service was pretty poor throughout the whole visit but I blame that on a combination of the place being extremely busy and us being a little rowdy and cranky. I don't know why they didn't call in all hands on a holiday weekend when a major convention was going on and a nearly sold out baseball game. They were obviously very understaffed.  We ordered a few apps right away. The artichoke hummus was good but not fantastic. The soft pretzels with cheese was the big hit of the night. Thank goodness we ordered two of those because everyone at the table couldn't get enough. Another huge plus on the hh menu was $4 Guinness pints and $3 for Santan beers. Awesome! After all that bread, everyone wanted smaller meals. Most got burgers (nothing special) and I got the roasted beet salad. That was a fantastic salad with a ton of flavor and perfectly cooked beets but it was a little smaller than I would expect for an entree. I would recommend ordering it as a starter or along with another small plate. One of my companions got the short rib stew which he raved about as well but this also appeared to be on the small side. The best value seems to be the daily special for $25. Not bad for prime rib and all the sides... two people at the table actually managed to split this. I finished my meal with the salted caramel pudding which I had to wait about 10 minutes to eat since the runner brought it with no spoons and our server had already cleared the table and then disappeared. See what I mean about the service?  Overall, this place did not meet my expectations but I don't think I can really form a comprehensive opinion after just this one visit. I will definitely be returning at some point in the future. Three stars for now.",

But since it is a Fox restaurant, I thought it would probably be a good experience nonetheless.   The food is not good, not bad. I think the food can be pretty much summed up with \"it tastes like Applebee's.\" We had bolognese and ribs.  My bolognese could have easily been remade at home with a jar of Ragu. The ribs, not counting the sauce, were pretty good. They were definitely very meaty and hearty. I wasn't too crazy about the sauce as it tasted too much like honey.  Like Applebee's (or Chili's, take your pick), the menu is generic and the food is just okay. The prices are not bad but a little steep for what you get.   I don't understand the popularity of this place. I'd trade the fancy interiors at the Arrogant Butcher for a hole-in-the-wall with good food any day.",

I should have just rode my bike.  The atmosphere is very typical to other Sam Fox restaurants - loud, open, big pieces, attractive waitstaff, private rooms.  My party split a number of appetizers and I have to give a special shout out to the soft pretzels with fondu and home made chips with onion dip! Yum! Its dangerous having that many delicious carbs...  They only have one vegetarian entree - but several appetizers and salads could also appease a meat-free palate.  I ordered the sweet potato tortellini and it was divine! It so rich and buttery that I almost felt like I was eating a dessert - I didn't know that a sweet potato could literally taste so sweet! I'm glad that I split it with another person, because it would have been too rich to tackle on my own.   The kale salad was mediocre and didn't come with almonds as the menu said - but some other kind of nut.  I much prefer the kale salad at True Food.  After splitting 4 or 5 appetizers, and then dinner...there was no room for dessert.  I would come back here during happy hour for some drinks and soft pretzels!",

The Arrogant Butcher kept only the most expensive dishes leaving you no choice but to spend twice than you normally would.

My hubby ordered a Kiltlifter on tap (his go-to beer when it's the only good craft beer on tap) and I ordered a drink called \"The Fix.\"  It was a mixture of limeade with a dash of raspberry compote on top.  The glass was full, and I mean full, of ice, but it was ok, because it was the good kind of ice.  You know, the kind that comes in little, easy to bite apart balls.  Mix in the fruit compote, and the drink went from a little sour, to delightfully sweet and lemonade-y.  We ordered the Jambalaya and the burger and we split each item.  The burger was juicy and the sauteed onions on top were so flavorful.  The Jambalaya was full of chicken, shrimp and Andouille sausage, but I took a bite and got a monster chicken bone in my mouth.  Not enjoyable.  We had to signal the bartender for her to come over because she never just checked on us to see how we were doing.  If we lived closer to this place, it would be a happy hour that we would frequent.",

This whole Cityscape thing is a big FAIL to me so far. Why they didn't choose to build an open aired mall like Kierland Commons is so Bed Bath and Beyond me. The signage is horrible. The curb appeal is non existent.   But when we finally turned the corner and saw the big A, the sidewalk was bustling with guests and the inside was energetic, fun and most appealing.   I had great service. Thank you Winston! The pretzel fondue was fabulous! The scallops with bacon and beans was okay. Not exactly executed as I would have liked. And the crab stuffed chicken was actually quite bland.   But I washed it all down with a beautiful, buttery bottle of Carneros Chardonnay and all in all a good time was had.   Arrogant? Perhaps. But certainly Insecure Butcher wouldn't work. So it's a winner so far to me and I will most definitely return.",

    "text": "After weeks of going back and forth, back and forth and checking tons of reviews, we decided to go check out the Arrogant Butcher ourselves. The reviews on here (Yelp!) were kinda all over the place so we weren't sure what to expect. Any-who, we came to the conclusion that:   1. The decor is pretty darn awesome.  2. The waitstaff was good. The place was fully staffed and timing on everything was good.  3. Reservations may not be such a bad idea. We made one at six and it was pretty dead in there when we arrived. However, by the time we left around 7:15, it was full. We went on a Saturday (no games of any sort going on downtown either).  4. WAY overpriced. Our breakdown: 3 cocktails, an appetizer, 3 mussels...$1 a pop, an entree (we split it) and 2 desserts = $100 without tip.  5. Filet was not worth it. At $29 bucks, you would expect something much more. It was overcooked and while the menu made it sound like it came with potatoes, it was more or less a small amount of pureed/creamed potatoes.  6. Drinks, appetizers and desserts were all awesome.   Final thought: We will be back....but for drinks and appetizers during happy hour which runs from 3-6 Mon-Sat (they are closed Sundays).",

Worth a wait but if you can call ahead or make a reservation or get there early to avoid the wait I would recommend it. All of the Fox Restaurants are amazing & local favorites. If you haven't tried all the Fox restaurants, I highly encourage it as they are all different and delicious! I have eaten at this location twice before events, once the busy & hustling bar (despite being immensely busy, the bar service was really good & they keep high levels of coverage/ bartenders!) and once at a table. I loved the sweet potato tortellini and the crab stuffed chicken. My husband enjoyed the steak. Great wine list & drink menu. This is my FAVORITE go to restaurant before events.",

Since the Friday special was King Crab Cioppino, our taste buds were anxious...until it arrived and tasted like bland nothingness and not sure what happened to the King Crab since it was non-existent.  To the credit of the staff, they asked us if we liked it and we shared that it was tasteless and disappointing.  They immediately took it off our bill and offered to comp us a different entree...kudos to them for trying to make it right.  It was this action that kept this review from being a one star.  I'd go here again for an appetizer and a drink, but I'd suggest skipping the meal part and heading to a different place.",

We had the pretzels and cheese which was good.The zucchini fritters were was not what I thought it would be. The texture was the problem- It was shredded and then fried. Not firm. Sort of squishy. Then we tried the warm peanut butter dessert which my husband loved and I got the salted caramel pudding. It was ok. Not as DECADENT as Culinary Dropout (their sister restaurant) but it was lighter. The atmosphere was fine. Parking is a pain but it is for all downtown restaurants.  Maybe it didn't hit me because I couldn't read the menu. It was dim. The menu uses small print and a light thin font so you can't read it. Had to take out the phone flashlights to see anything. Not cool.",

    "text": "So my friend and I decided we were going to do the First Friday artwalk downtown in Phoenix this past weekend.  Living in north Scottsdale like we do, we don't get a lot of opportunity to get down south so it sounded good.  Apparently, tho.. we are not very arty as  our artwalk consisted of walking in one bank building and the room in it with old pictures of Phoenix on the walls and then we were done and ready for a cocktail..  Hey, go with what you are good at I always say!!! We started at Copper Blues and had a drink there first.. I had heard about the Arrogant Butcher and that was going to be ultimately our final destination.     BTW.. Copper Blues is pretty darn young.  I hear that the bands are good later but at 7 pm.. not so much my style.  So anyway, we were in the City Center but I swear we could not find the Arrogant Butcher. We walked in four bars along the way trying to find it... and the one on the roof was pretty cool.  When we finally got to the Butcher, we sat at the bar and were immediately attended to by a very nice bartender.  My friend had been asking for some kind of   liqueur that she got in Europe when she lived there and not one of the bars that we entered had it but the Butcher did!  Made her night...:)   We decided to eat light and ordered the pretzels with provolone  fondue and the Kale salad.  OMG.  I could have eaten the entire bowl of pretzels with cheese myself. Screw the diet!!! LOL... super tasty. And I really liked the kale salad too.. I personally am not a fan of their salad at the Quarter but this one was delish... it had marconi almonds and an amazing dressing.. and it was $5??? And that was not a happy hour price? Score!  BTW, the bar can get pretty crowded because of its proximity to the arena ... a game let out and there was some nice eye candy walking around which was enjoyable... so the whole trip was worth it... even with seeing no art.",

Menu is OK - no wow to it. Best thing there are the pretzels! The biggest complaint I have is the almost too common, TERRIBLY SLOW service. I recently went to AB with a group of 6 people for lunch at 130pm. Mind you, lunch rush was over. Took a little too long to get seated because we had called ahead and made a reservation - still had to wait 10 minutes.  After being seated, it took about 15 minutes for our beverages to arrive - sparkling water and lemonade ... really?!?!!? It was even worse when we ordered our food. Everyone ordered a salad, get this, it took a full 20 minutes for the salads to arrive in a half empty restaurant. AB should take notice and fix the problem. More and more restaurants are opening up in downtown, people will have more choices and AB will have to eventually address lousy service.",

We had got our appetizers and five minutes later they brought the entrees while we where half the way through the appetizers. It was obvious we were still working on our starters, four half full plates of cheese and prosciutto. Instead of taking the entrees back to the kitchen, he dropped them on the table and left. One of the entrees was a ribeye, our cutlery was not replaced and had to ask for a meat knife, which tool me five minutes because none of the waiters was paying attention. The steak was nicely cooked, but having to leave half dish of a beautiful prosciutto on the plate or else the meat will get cold is not a good experience.",

The drinks were empty most of the time as well. The manager was quite rude when we asked for her, and the waiter never did apologize...the manager also was quick to blame the waiter for the error, which seemed very unprofessional in my opinion. In addition, the cost of the food seemed to FAR exceed the quality...the fact that you can get artisan bread for the cheeses but then a BLT comes on a bun seems a bit silly. Overall, the experience was very lax and not very enjoyable.",

We had no issue being seated quickly on the patio which was perfect for the lovely weather. Several of the dishes sounded tasty and the waiter was helpful in providing personal favorites depending on our mood. We split the pretzel tots with provolone fondue, amazing. Little pillows of heaven. Then I ordered the squash & pomegranate salad with added chicken, very creative and yummy. Also a large bowl, plenty filling. My friend had the pastrami on a pretzel bun which he said was also tasty, although he expected more flavor from the pretzel bun. I had heard the peanut butter dessert was amazing, and had full intention of ordering it, however alas I was too full. I wish I had tried this place earlier in my trip, I would have liked to go back for more!",

Know this and make a reservation!  Happy hour is fun. Great specials. Love the pretzels & fondue. Get it, you won't regret it.  The salmon salad is possibly the best salad I ever had.",

I'm telling you, I've never had such great service both from our waiter and manager. The restaurant itself is gorgeous and very clean. If I had to say one bad thing about this place, I'd say they will never be able to top last nights dining experience.",

Still, at little 'over the top' with friendliness (anyone ever watch Office Space...well, I met the female Brian...friendly, but 'over the top').  So the pretzels were supposed to be fantastic and they were good with the cheese.  But Rock Bottom (chain) serves better.  However, Tabouli salad was very tasty.  Overall, it was a good experience outside near the Suns stadium, but, the food was average.  It's part of a larger chain where they just change the name of their locations...so don't be fooled, this isn't a local establishment such as as Three Doors Down in Portland.  For what it's worth...decent food, good service, but nothing spectacular.",

    "text": "I had been wanting to get to Arrogant Butcher for a while and finally ended up here on Saturday night. First let me say, we were about 20 minutes late for our reservation and they got us in RIGHT AWAY. No complaints here. I was fairly shocked that they were able to accomodate that..very pleasantly surprised. Next, our waiter (I wish I could recall his name...) was seriously EXCELLENT. We told him we had never been here before and he told us all about the menu, what he recommends..etc. He was very prompt and attentive..always made sure our glasses were full and we were happy. I have nothing bad to say about him :) So we ordered chicken fingers for my daughter (I know this is not a kid friendly place but we were headed downtown to suffer through Disney On Ice for her so this was the least she could do for us..right?!!) and they were SO GOOD. Their batter was nothing like other chicken strips...I would definitely get these next time I am here. My mother in law got the Sweet Potato Tortellini which she loved..she did say it was a small portion for what it costs but she enjoys small portions so this was no big deal to her. My husband got the Chicken Stroganoff, he said it was \"good\" not great but \"good\". Now, I got the daily sepcial which was the Prime Rib...I ordered it Medium Rare which it definitely was and I can not complain about that...however, not only was my PR not warm..my scalloped potatoes were barely even lukewarm. So, I get that Medium rare PR will not be hot but my potatoes...it felt like mine was sitting under a lamp for a long time waiting for my 2 yr old's chicken fingers to be done since they were inedible for about 10 minutes. All in all, I would say we were pretty pleased by the restaurant. It is very cool inside and had a great feel. I dont know that my PR was worth the $25 it cost. But, I would come back to sit at the bar and have a drink/apps with the husband minus the two year old :)",

We just had a baby girl six weeks ago & This was our first date night out so we were looking forward to a good experience. I made reservations for 4 people and we arrived at 6:45, the place wasn't really busy yet. The hostess was friendly and sat us right away. Our server was great as well, very knowledgeable and offered her suggestions since we were all new to the menu. To drink I had the Skinny Raspberry Mojito, it was blander than I expected so I opted out of a second one and ordered a Kiltlifter. My girlfriend had \"The Pink Drink\" which she raved about! For an appetizer we ordered the pretzel fondue which was perfectly delicious, the pretzels were soft & light! Each of us loved our main dish (which came out quicker than we expected), I ordered the short rib stew which had the perfect amount of spice and was served with a corn bread muffin which was to die for! Overall- great service, friendly staff, delicious menu items, & a really cool ambiance! We had a great experience here and love to explore Downtown Phoenix whenever we get the opportunity so we will definitely be back!",

We had the pretzels  with provolone fondue (fabulous comfort snack and same as Culinary Dropout), oysters (there were just OK...I've had much better, but they weren't bad). We ordered the crispy rock shrimp off the Happy Hour menu, not bad, but nothing special. I will say the Happy Hour prices were a great deal, and the food was pretty good. I can't give more stars because nothing really stood out to me. I will say I loved the upscale, modern, clean decor and the fun ambiance. Lots of flat screen TV's in the bar area where we sat, so it's probably a great place to watch Monday Night Football.  I will be back for Happy Hour and possibly dinner.",

He was knowledgable about the menu and his recommendations were spot on to each of our tastes.  We started with the zucchini fritters. They were unique in that they had cheese inside but could have used a bit more seasoning--but nothing that the delicious aioli couldn't fix!  For my main I ordered the sweet potato tortelli. It was a dish that intrigued me from the menu and our server recommended it as well. It was good but in my opinion could have used sage to give the dish more flavor. My husband got the short ribs stew which he raved about. The cornbread that came with the stew was so good, not too dry and just enough kick from the peppers inside.   We finished with dessert which were perfectly portioned. We split the cheesecake which was to die for and the chocolate cake that was great as well.",

Which isn't necessarily bad - it just ends up making me feel like I have been strategically targeted through focused research groups and lulled into believing this experience is unique.    The downtown area definitely needs a place like that, and Fox has a a knack for creating successful places.  I wasn't surprised to read up on it and see that it was one of the clan.  I had already eaten by the time I met up with the group there, so I was happy they decided to do a variety of appetizers.  We ordered the Pretzel Fondue, Potato Fritters, Mussels, and Rock Shrimp.    The Pretzel Fondue and the Potato Fritters were definitely worth every minute I would have to spend at the gym the next day.  The Mussels were tasteless and the Shrimp was just a little greasy.  Their cocktails are pretty creative and are a modern twist on some oldies:  The old  fashioned was good, but my favorite was the Rhubarb Collins.  Our waiter was great.  He was attentive and fun with our medium sized group.  You could tell he enjoyed his job - and loved the food.  It was so much fun to ask him about the various dishes, and listen to him describe every texture, taste and ingredient in each.  Sadly, his description of the rock shrimp was better than the real thing.  My rating is really a reflection on the \"not really a chain\" chain restaurant concept.  Admittedly, the place is cool, the menu is fun and interesting and a gem in the downtown area.",

Perfectly located across from the baseball field, they offered an excellent menu, and a good selection of local brews.

    "text": "I'm a big fan of FOX Restaurants, but just had an ok experience.  The decor and service were great especially for an after work rush.  Although, it is truly a verbatim Happy Hour that ends at 6pm.  Not the biggest fan of a short happy hour, but I understand that Downtown doesn't draw the same volume of people after work as Tempe or Scottsdale.  We decided to sit at the hightop bar so we could get a great view of the place.  It's a very open concept with a nice view into the hustling kitchen and outward view of the US Airways Center.  Great urban vibe.  The food is where it fell a little short. The Salmon sounded great with farro, fennel, and roasted apples, but didn't live up to it's $22 price tag.  Portion size was decent, but nothing outstanding about the flavor.  Maybe my time in NYC has spoiled my taste buds.  Our bartender was also a bourbon drinker and recommended the Candlestick Maker.  She made a great drink.  I tried the Turkey Sloppy Joe feeling that the poblano peppers would pair well with the bourbon, but should have trusted my gut and figured that the sloppy joe was probably part of the kids menu.  Could really use some more zest and kick.  Overall, it's a nice addition to CityScape and will definitely try to make happy hour again.  Oh, the Artichoke Hummus was the best part of the night.  Make sure to dip in.",

The food is awesome and the service is great. The staff is super friendly and waits well on their patrons.   We started off with the pate, pineapples, some cheese, and oysters. We shared the kale salad and the crab stuffed chicken and it was superb! My 3 yr old daughter even loved her meal. I'm pleasantly surprised that everything we ate was so well prepared and delicious.  The baseball game had just let out and they were still able to get us seated in a timely manor in a spacious booth that could have easily accommodated a few more guests. Compared to many restaurants that I have been to this place really has it together with a homey and welcoming atmosphere. I have to give the arrogant butcher 5 stars!!! I feel fortunate that the events of the evening had landed us here for a fantastic dinner.  I will happily return here with friends and family in the near future.  Thank you for the fantastic experience and great food!!!",

I normally take my burger cooked to a medium, but when the waitress didn't ask, I didn't speak up. Perhaps I should have. The meat was thin, dry and overdone, and the toppings did little to help that - hardly worthy of restaurant prices. Others in my party had a similar experience with the salmon. Overall, a middling experience. With the enormous number of sports bars in downtown, I recommend trying something else in the area instead.",

There's something about bad behavior accepted widely in restaurants. Disappointingly, an arrogant butcher is a concept, not a reality.  WHY GO THERE? Good selection of comfort food in a hip industrial space. On a nice day, outside seating means people watching.  WHATCHAGOT? I enjoyed the Turkey Pastrami served in a pretzel bun. It's a marriage made in split-personality heaven: turkey meets pastrami, pretzel meets bun.  Crispy rock shrimp is great tasting appetizer. On Mondays, I like the special meatloaf and mashed potatoes. Good selection of cocktails.  YOU GOT SERVED. Water doesn't go dry.  Service is attentive. There's nothing arrogant about this place.",

There were three of us and we ended up having to order two Charcuterie plates as the portions were pretty small (especially for the price when you pay a la carte for two meats and a cheese - over $20 a plate).  The waiter raved about the Beef Short Rib Stew, so two of us ordered it. Definitely fell short and was incredibly salty and lacked any type of texture, even with cornbread crumbled in it.

Food came out together, about ten minutes after ordering.  Little on the loud side.  Food options are on a brief menu. Our group had various salads options and the tortoli (sp?).  The latter is a ravioli-type pasta, plus a heart attack. Amazingly tasty with a very rich filling.  Probably a pound of butter in the dish.  I received some good advice to order it with the chicken to balance the meal out and that was dead on.  Those in our group who had the salads spoke highly of them, as well.  Fun place and one to visit, again.",

When I asked the hostess if there is a gluten free menu and she said 'no, but anything can be made gluten free'. However, that is not the case. I decided on getting the fish tacos and they were less than average. I love Fox Restaurants, but won't be coming back to this one.",

    "text": "After finding a few other downtown restaurants packed before a sporting event, we decided to give Arrogant Butcher a try.   We walked in around 5 pm on a Saturday and were seated immediately. Soon after, we realized we had just barely beaten the dinnertime rush - score!  Since we weren't in the mood for gigantic meals, my fiance and I opted to split the Jumbo Shrimp and Oyster apps and the Fish N' Chips plate. The shrimp arrived and were HUGE.. well worth the $3ish dollar/piece that they were priced at. Oysters were pretty standard in size and taste.   When our entree arrived at the table, I was happy to see that the kitchen had already split the Fish N' Chips onto two separate plates as the portion was quite large - Definitely enough to have 2 adults feeling quite full! The battered and fried fish arrived warm and had a lovely crispiness to them. The side of fries arrived warm and tasted freshly deep fried as well.  My only drawback is that as restaurant got busier, our waiter seemed to drop off with his service (for instance, we had to flag down another waiter for more cocktail sauce) and it seemed we waited a bit longer than normal for raw seafood apps. Otherwise, our experience was great and we'd definitely consider returning next time we are in DT PHX!",

My husband and I tried this place a couple weeks ago since we love other fox concepts and now live in phoenix.  Unfortunately, it didn't live up to the hype for us. Everything was...okay. But for $74 after dinner and a tip we expected more.  Pros: Service was attentive but not overbearing. I asked her for a drink recommendation telling her I prefer vodka and she recommended the Pink Drink which was tasty.   We started with the pretzels which were delish. They are the same as are served at culinary dropout so that was a safe bet and didnt disappoint.   They validate parking if you use the garage attached to the building.  Cons: Other than my drink and our pretzel bites, the food was very underwhelming.   First off, everything needed salt and a lot of it. We both went to town with the salt shaker.   I had the fish and chips. They were very under seasoned and a little too greasy but otherwise okay. My husband had the beef stew. He said the jalapeno corn muffin was the best part of his meal and even adding salt didnt help it much.  So definitely not the most disappointing experience but for 20 dollars or more per plate, we will pass on future visits.",

That said, the Crab Stuffed Chicken they have for dinner here was one of the most divine dishes I have ever had. The night I came here for dinner (it was a work thing), I was under a great deal of stress, and I normally get appetite loss when I'm anxious, however I could not stop taking more bites of that incredible meal. Before I knew it, my plate was empty and I regretted not having slowed down to savor it. But whatever, c'est la vie! Anyway I look forward to enjoying more of the butcher's (who has every right to be arrogant) gustatory delights. P.S. this is my first yelp review, that's how much I loved it",

For my meal I got the sea bass, and it was also amazing.  Fish was cooked perfectly and the whole dish had fantastic flavor.

It was a busy day and a few conversations had just let out but our wait time to be seated was only a few minutes.  We were greeted by our waiter who made some great suggestions.  We ordered the charcuterie platter and the deviled eggs.  The eggs had a TON of garlic so beware of garlic breath.   The table next to us had been waiting a few extra minutes because of the convention rush and our waiter was so apologetic and brought them a completely item and made sure they had their drinks refreshed.  Our amazing waiter also brought us the artichoke hummus (which was super yummy) to thank us for our patience during our wait.  We eat out a lot, and this was a normal wait time but I appreciate him going the extra mile.  For lunch we ordered fish tacos and the New York.  When we asked to hold the butter on the steak, the waiter mentioned there was dairy in the potato accompaniments and offered to substitute vegetables without us even asking.  The steak was cooked perfectly and the fish was super fresh.   At the end of the meal he brought us ice tea to go since it's so hot and gave us tips on parking and offered to validate for us.  Great food, and great experience.",

They did a great job of being there when you need them but not being intrusive.  Anytime I go to a new place that purports to be Steak-centric I always order a burger, because if you screw it up, there's no way I'm going to trust you to fix me a steak.  Everything is made scratch and I ordered a Cheeseburger and fries. It was one of the better burgers I've ever had. A good sized portion, without being obscene like a lot of placed that think they need to server you a half pound of meat. Bun, condiments, fries...all perfect.   Do yourself a favor and order some of their Passion Fruit iced tea, it's wonderful.  Later in the day, we had our business event in one of the back rooms and the experience was still fantastic. The staff took great care of us and the charcuterie, the pretzels and cheddar fondue, and the desserts were all fantastic.  Highly recommend if you're in the downtown area and need a good meal or for a small business event.",

Our server Gino was absolutely amazing, he was informative, nice, (Not arrogant like tons of the other comments) and check on us regularly.  We got everything he recommended other than an old fashion because im pregnant and every item of food we received was just amazing.  Another server by the name Kelley overheard us talking about our anniversary and went out of her way to inform Gino, he then took the liberty to go the extra mile and offer us a desert on the house to share.   My husband and I are always hesitant to go to \"expensive\" restaurants because he never leaves full and its just never worth the 100 dollar tab including tip but Arrogant Butcher WAS ABSOLUTELY WORTH IT!  We share aged cheddar and Cobba meat? I believe that was the name I got the ribs and my husband got the New York Steak and both were top notch.  My husband said the best steak he has had at a restaurant including the keg.  Thanks Arrogant Butcher, Gino, and Kelley for making our 1 year anniversary awesome.",

I tried the crab stuffed chicken (with capers, lemon jus and spinach) and sampled some of my brothers filet mignon (Boursin Creamed Spinach, Crispy Potato for $36) and his gf's beef short rib stew with a side of corn bread (Green Chile, Fried Egg). The stuffed chicken was great because there was a lot of crab meat. The lemon added a great zesty and fresh flavor to the moist chicken. The filet mignon was very tender and was cooked perfectly medium rare as ordered. The stew was a bit bland but the cornbread made a nice accompaniment. I also ordered a pineapple pisco sour (Pineapple Infused Mistral Pisco, Snap Molasses, Giffard Orgeat, Orange & Peychaud's Bitters) and tried my brother's butcher's blood and sand scotch cocktail (Pig's Nose Scotch, Cherry Heering,Carpano Antica, Orange Juice, Clove & Orange Bitters) and his gf's Modelo beer cocktail (after school special: Raspberry Tea Infused Jose Cuervo, Ginger Agave, Lime, Modelo Especial). The after school special cocktail was my favorite one because you got the side of beer in a can so it was the most bang for your buck. It was also the most refreshing to me The cocktails were about $10-12 each. Our waiter was extremely friendly, helpful and awesome. They have \"daily specials\" that aren't actually daily (only Thursday-Sunday). The decor here is really awesome and trendy. They have private rooms that you can rent out and also a larger dining area that has plaid booths. They have cool chalk art on the wall and a pretty snazzy bathroom with nice tiles (if anyone cares). The waiter said all of the appetizers, particularly the pretzel fondue were really good so I'd be interested in ordering more appetizers in the future.",

All of the flavors of their dishes are married beautifully and every bite you take will dance in your mouth. Pure happiness! You won't go wrong with any of their signature drinks. Their only downfall is there is always a long wait so make sure you plan accordingly especially during large downtown events.",

I'm going to start with dessert first - you will miss out on life if you do not save room for either the Salted Caramel Pudding (we added green apple slices which put it over the top) and we had the cheesecake 3 times. Today, we had dessert for lunch. On the menu side, we had the grilled fish tacos, salmon, and sea bass; all of which were divine. Another not to be missed is the hummus - it was the best we have ever had!  Will definitely visit again!",

Unfortunately the night before we had a less then satisfying one, so we decided to skip it. We started out with the pretzel rolls and provolone appetizer. AMAZING. We even took the leftover  pretzel balls home on our fight with us. We split the carnitas plate and it was delicious. The savory meat plus tangy veggies and a bit of sweet from the corn cake was awesome. The staff was very friendly and our server was on top of our needs. I was stuffed!

After reviewing the menu we decided on pretzels and fondue to start, 6 shrimp from the raw bar (delicious) and 2 NY steaks cooked medium and a stuffed chicken.  The NY steaks came out Med-well to well. Good flavor but charred and cooked more than we liked. The stuffed chicken had a strong lemon flavor but lacked in other substance and the cooked spinach left him hungry. We went back for 9 more shrimp from the raw bar to wrap up our meal. Service is unreliable, hard to find. Pleasant when you can find them. Not sure we would come back here for dinner.",

Like a retro, train station kinda feel. There were these ginormous beehive lamp shade light fixtures that weren't cohesive and I wish they'd take them out because they were an eyesore as well. The restrooms were splendid, very clean, nice large stalls. Aside from the snooty hostesses, the service was splendid.   My girlfriend and I came during restaurant week. It was packed when we arrived at 8:00 p.m. on a Tuesday night, I would recommend rezzies. For starters my friend had the soup and I had the cheese plate, both were delish. The cheese plate came with the cutest, tiny spoons and jars for jam and mustard... took everything I had to not put them in my purse. I can't remember what my main dish was called but it was two pieces of fried fish with a crab cake in the middle, topped with gravy and capers and a side of steamed spinach. It tasted like really good cafeteria food, nothing to write about here. For dessert I had the blueberry something or other. It tasted exactly like a pretzel torte I use to make in my early 20's, tasty but again, nothing to write home about.   I will becoming back for sure. I know they're has to be more to that kitchen that what I was served, I just know it!",

My husband ordered a kilt lifter and I ordered a mr.pineapple which was not too sweet( I hate beers that are too sweet) we ordered off of their happy hour menu which didn't offer too much to choose from. We order the garlic and mushroom toast and also a salmon toast ( I forgot the whole name of that one) both were very good and only 4 bucks. We also ordered the pretzel bites with cheese fondue and omg it was so good and they give you a good portion. I wasn't impressed with their regular menu. Not much to choose from and the prices were high. Perhaps that is why it is called the arrogant butcher. We probably will not be coming back but it is always good to try new things and different spots.",

The food was wonderful, portions were just the right amount, and we enjoyed both hearing the Lumberyard Brewery owners and rep speak about the different beers and also hearing the Sous Chef and his assistant speak about the food and pairings (Fox RC definitely hires chefs who can speak to large crowds, not all chefs, from my experience, are capable of such). The chefs were excited to be able to \"go off menu\" for the pairings and were excited to share their thought process.   Jaime seemed to be the manager in charge of the event and he made the whole experience very fun, laid back & welcoming. This was the third dinner of their summer series (we missed the other two unfortunately) but I am excited to see what other events AB comes up with in the future - I'll be there. I am also looking forward to visiting the restaurant to experience their normal dining menu. We will be back!",

It was a lengthy decision but I had to hurry up because the lunch rush was starting up and the house soon was going to be hopping.  If you read Phoenix Magazine, my lunch was featured on the cover.  I started with the corn bread. This bread was the bomb. Moist, golden brown and would spring back just a bit upon the touch. I could taste a little jalapeno heat. It was wonderful. I easily could have had another piece of bread.  Now the hearty beef bowl. Even tho I would have preferred to have this dish on a cool crisp day, that just ain't happening for a while longer. The gravy was just right. The brown meat was perfect. There was other stuff in there but I didn't pick at it to study, I just ate. There was a little time for the different flavors to mingle & marry as they rocked the palate. Loved the egg over easy.  Thank you Jason for taking care of me.",

During shift change the service spiraled down considerably.   I travel for a living so I'm constantly in and out of new places. My honest honest opinion of AB is that they complacent.   I went to the restroom and returned in 3 minutes and the bartender threw my full drink - I called this to his attention and he appeared annoyed to which I escalated my demand for the refulflment of my drink.  This led to an altercation which I can only attribute to the fact hat I'm a black guy visiting Phoenix - I honestly don think that I was black with virtually unlimited credit.  I think the owners of this establishment and it's group if establishments should seriously reconsider the bartender and management staff.

I'm not big on pretzels or pretzel buns but the House Soft Pretzels are really good, particularly with the fondue. Draft beer specials (12 oz) were cold and reasonably priced. I indulged in a few nice IPAs. Nothing else on the HH menu demanded our attention.  For dinner I had the King Crab Cioppino, others in my party tried the ribs and assorted meats and cheeses. All-in-all, I found the entree quality good but the portion size is smaller than I would expect.  The charcuterie was a joke though. With several meats and cheeses ordered, there wasn't much to show for it except the desire for more. I believe the waiter said portion size is meat 1 oz and cheese 3 oz. Regardless, good quality but lacking seriously in quantity.  Service was good although a bit more attention desired, particularly to my empty water and beer glasses!  I would go back but I would be very selective in what I ordered. Sandwiches at next table looked great, so I would probably go that route, along with some other appetizers.",

Its always so cool to see how the food is prepared. The guys on the line are so friendly and professional. They even threw us a few pretzels and dip just because.

The restaurant is housed in a warehouse/loft and you can feel the energy and liveliness when you walk in.  I started out with the beet salad which was outstanding.  The dressing has a subtle sweetness and acidity and the whole dish was fresh and satisfying.  I like the added textures that the pistachios, green beans, and asparagus contributed.  The grilled salmon was a tad bit over seasoned, but otherwise it was perfectly cooked and tasty.  It was served with green beans, smoked potatoes, and a very yummy sweet corn puree which complimented the fish.  I finished the meal off with the hot chocolate cake which was delicious.

My personal favorites were the goat cheese stuffed peppers and the toasted ciabatta, garlic oil & balsamic. Then everything ordered by the group was fantastic!  Slow roasted Prime Rib, Prime Rib French Dip, Heirloom Beet Salad & Double Cut Pork Chops!  Prime Rib was soft and flavorful, French Dip was juicy and satisfying, Heirloom Beet Salad(not the nasty red thing you think of) was surprising light and flavorful and the Pork Chop had a juicy smoked like flavor. All delicious!  Then we had the salted caramel pudding and the warm peanut butter cup for dessert.  Salted caramel pudding was good, but the warm peanut butter cup was surprisingly light and delicious.  Normally you think heavy and thick for peanut butter, but this was not that.  Definitely try it!  Overall great experience and sets a high bar for Phoenix!",

I came on a Thursday night to watch the game, and it was busy in the dining area so we easily sat at the bar (open seating). We got the pretzel bites - you get a LOT -, the butchers platter, and the waldorf salad.  All items were good, but the butcher's platter was the winner. For two people, it worked out well. We definitely could have gone without the pretzel bites, but oh well!  As far as drinks, I got the polish fix. It was good and refreshing. I really liked the real fruit they included too.   Overall, it was a fun, chill experience.",

I searched on yelp and decided that this would be a good place to grab food. It is located next to the sports arena and was within walking distance of my hotel and the convention center. The area reminds me a lot of LA Live in Downtown Los Angeles.   Since it was lunchtime, it was pretty emoty when I walked in, but it was happy hour. So while I waited for my to go order, I did get a beer to hold me overm the Grand Canyon American Pilsner hit the spot perfectly.   The service was great. The food came out quickiy and it was pretty good. I got the turkey pastrami sandwich, which would probably have been better if i ate it in the restaurant, but it was pretty good to go!

It's a Fox Concepts restaurant (Whole Foods, Flour Child, etc.) and it's consistent with their brand of a nice quality restaurant.  What makes this restaurant different that I've never seen before is that as an appetizer you can build a charcuterie plate using a menu kind of like a normal sushi menu. So you go down the list and check off cheeses, meats, veggies, nuts, spreads, and it all comes to your table. I could just eat that and wine, but we also split a sea bass which was perfectly cooked and lightly seasoned. I can't turn down dessert so I ordered the peanut butter dessert that is a creaky peanut butter dish, with dipping cookies and chocolate. Do you love peanut butter? Then order this! One last point ok the food there is no decaf cappuccino so keep that in mind if you're into that after an evening meal.  You can make a rezzie, also they validate parking if you park in the garage attached to the restaurant. I didn't see it, as I parked at Talking Stick but the waitress told us about it.  There were also private rooms for big groups.  Bon Appetit!",

    "text": "Randomly went here for lunch while downtown Phoenix on a Saturday.  When we walked in at 2:00pm, the main dining room was practically empty, but the hostess asked \"Do you have a reservation?\" -- obviously I replied \"No.\"  Instead of walking us 10 feet to the side to seat us at one of the many empty window-side tables with a view, the hostess took us down a series of hallways and lead us to a windowless room in the far back full of creepy photos of children and John McCain covering the walls.   The overpriced cheese and meat appetizer was good.  My girlfriend's stew was okay (nothing special, pretty equal to Campbell's $3 chunky stew).  THOUGH, my $24 crab stuffed chicken is the main reason we'll probably never go back to this place if we're in Phoenix -- it had zero seasoning, and was served over a small bed of lightly seasoned spinach leaves.  The chicken tasted like cardboard and the crab tasted like it was dumped out from a can and heated in a microwave...  I'm not one of those snooty yelp snobs as this review may paint me to be, BUT if I'm paying you $24 for my entree, it better have some flavor (I could have walked outside and dined on some bushes and dirt for free -- would have been the same).  If you want to be shoved in a storage closet and fed wood-chips, this is the place for you.  If not, I don't know, try McDonalds, at least you get what you pay for there.  p.s. Our overly-tattooed (obviously to cover up lack of personality) waitress DID offer to get me another entree since mine was like eating a sandal -- so there was an effort there, so... they've got that going for them..?",

    "text": "I had a very disappointing experience at The Arrogant Butcher. Having been there before, I chose it as a restaurant to bring some friends from out of town to. This was a party of nine. All women.   At first experience was fine. A little bit slow but definitely not anything I would've complained about. When it came time for the bill, one woman was brought an individual check and everything else was put on one check. We realized there must've been a miscommunication in discussing the bill. I asked the waitress, Monica, if she would please split the check so everybody could have their own bill as we were all separate. She immediately declined and said we should have told her at the beginning that we wanted separate checks. She said that we could do the math for each item we ordered and write our names of the top of the receipt totaling what each of us got to the corresponding debit card name.  While I did feel like this was a little bit ridiculous, we all complied.   One of my friends leaned over to another friend and said that the waitress just being lazy. Those same friends, after doing their math, got up went to the bathroom. The waitress followed them into the bathroom and began to yell and scream at one of them. She then came out and hysterically yelled and screamed at me as well. I kept trying to give her the check that we had taken the time to total out each patron's menu items but she refused to accept it. She said she was transferring us to the bar and wanted nothing more to do with our table. I had to personally flag down the manager even though he was made well aware of the situation. I actually had to flag him down twice before he finally came to talk to our table. Meanwhile, we still had not been given the opportunity to pay our bill.   My friend who was yelled at in the bathroom explained what happened to the manager and he made no apology. He kept saying it was an unfortunate situation and he wished it hadn't happened. He also kept trying to change the subject and asking her how she liked the food. He said he wish there was something he could do to make it better. I kept saying that an apology would make it a lot better but he would not do it. He then left for a few minutes and came back saying he was going to give half off of everyone's bill. I told him that while that was very generous, that was not what we were looking for. It would be very nice if he gave our table an apology. He still kept repeating that it was unfortunate and he wished it hadn't happened. Towards the very end of our confrontation, he said he apologized for the situation. It took us an hour and a half just to pay our check. During that time nobody refilled her waters or did anything even near our table. We were just trapped there and made to feel like we did something wrong. While my one friend admits that she should not have said the waitress was lazy, and she did apologize for that, I feel our table was treated extremely unfairly and rude by your establishment. The fact that the manager had no reaction to a waitress following a customer into the bathroom and screaming at her was shocking and appalling. I love Fox restaurants and I was so disappointed to not only be treated that way, but also to have my out-of-town guests screamed at by a waitress.",

There were very few people there, but by the time I left, it was packed!  I had my laptop doing some work, but never felt rushed.    I was torn between the Cubano and the turkey pastrami...decided to go with the Cubano.  I do not regret it!  Pros: GREAT service!  The server was helpful, friendly, and attentive. OMG.  The Cubano was NOTHING like the wimpy, thin Cubano's I've had in the past.  It was thick, toasty, and savory.  It was so hearty that I could only eat half!  Cons: Umm...can't think of any...",

And with the downtown location, there's plenty to do in the meantime. I liked the text message system to let me know when our table was ready.  The service was terrific. We were seated on the patio, but heat lamps kept us from being too chilly.  I ordered the barbecue chicken entree. It was good but not amazing. The chicken was a little dry and it didn't taste much like barbecue. I LOVED the coleslaw that came with it and the cornbread muffin was delicious.",

They were sold out of the pasta dish I wanted and it took an hour (not exaggerating) for our plates to arrive.   My friend told me you should never order seafood in the desert. Now I know why, because my salmon was so overcooked and dry that I had to ask for extra lemons just to make the taste bearable. My colleagues had burgers and a kale bowl and only 2/6 of us enjoyed our dinner.  Maybe it was an off night during our visit, but our experience was really disappointing. Although our server tried to be nice about the slow service, he did not really do anything to make up for it.",

Hubby had the fried chicken with honey biscuit and the chicken was cooked to perfection with a crunchy flavorful exterior. The biscuit was flaky (huge) and melt-in-your mouth perfect. I chose from the RW menu and had the hummus (a bit spicy), the green chile stew (perfectly seasoned with huge chunks of short rib) and the salted caramel pudding (creamy, delicate, full of caramel flavor - and probably the best dessert I've ever had... hands down.) I would hit them up again and enjoy ordering just about anything from their hit list. Service was good, there was a tiny snafu with our order but our wait staff fixed it up in no time at all. Good for a small group of friends, date night, or stop by on your own - good beers on tap too.",

    "text": "I flew into Phoenix late Saturday morning to visit a girlfriend of mine. Once she picked me up from the airport, off we went to start our weekend of eating and catching up. Our first stop was at The Arrogant Butcher to grab some lunch. Located in downtown Phoenix within walking distance to US Airways Center. We parked in a nearby parking garage for $12 -_-   While you won't find an arrogant butcher at the restaurant, you will find: 1) a hip and stylish atmosphere 2) good food 3) attentive service  Whoever the interior designer is for this space should really receive recognition. I loved everything about it from the floor, to the walls, to the furniture, even the bathroom was awesome. The combination of modern with a slight touch of trendy, vintage, and shabby chic (I clearly can't pinpoint what type of style they were rocking) was very inviting and just plain cool.   The food was good--it wasn't great but it wasn't bad. Me and my friend shared THE MARKET SALAD: sweet corn, tomato, asparagus, & local ricotta. I ordered the TURKEY SLOPPY JOE: grilled poblano, pepper jack cheese & turkey with fries. My friend ordered the BEEF SHORT RIB STEW: green chiles, a fried egg on top, and a side of cornbread.   Our salad was crisp and refreshing--easily filling if you order a salad as your entree. My sloppy joe came out alright, nothing to rave about, but the fries were delish and the mini jar of ketchup that came along with my fries was a very nice attention to detail and a nice way to keep the ketchup contained instead of having a glob of it all over my plate. My friend's short rib stew came served to her in a mini Dutch oven: super cute. The stew was really good with chunks of tender short rib mixed in with the runny yolk and fried egg whites. The only thing negative thing about the stew was it was a bit salty. The cornbred was moist and not as gritty as some other cornbreads tend to be.   Our server was extremely attentive. When he found out I was visiting from CA he struck up a quick conversation since he grew up in San Diego.  I thoroughly enjoyed my time here. Next time I'd like to come back, sit at the bar, and try some of their enticing cocktails.",

    "text": "Frankly, not sure what all the fuss is about.  It was fine; not great, not lousy, just fine.  We stopped in during happy hour before heading to the Giants/Dbacks opening game.  (Giants won, yay!)  The place was reasonably busy, but not crazy given that there were still a lot of empty tables.  We chose a number of items from the bar menu - pretzel rolls with cheese fondue, an antipasto plate, grilled mushrooms and marcona almonds.  The cheese fondue was about as bland as cheese can be and the pretzel rolls looked good, but were more bready than chewy like a pretzel should be and they pretty much tasted like pancakes.  The antipasto plate was a few slices of shaved salami, 2 small pieces of French bread and about a teaspoon of some kind of goat cheese.  This came with a small amount of house mustard and a cherry jam or chutney.  The plate was about 5 times too large for the small amount of stuff.  I don't know if they forgot something or this is just what they serve.  We ended up dumping the mustard in the fondue and that made it taste a lot better, so at least it served some purpose.  Maybe they should use this idea and do this, too?  The service was average at best.  We were seated quickly and our server, Tom, started out on a good note, but he was not in the picture much after we were served.  Our beers were long gone before he showed back up again, and the second round that we ordered was long in coming. The other tables near us seemed like they were having the same experience.  Don't know if this is the norm for their service.  Like I said, nothing was horrible, nothing was great.  It was just OK.  This is probably a 2 to 2.5 star experience, but the Giants won so I'm rounding up.  Maybe we should have ordered a burger or something.  Who knows?",

We had a weird service change at our table but it was for the better.  The second server had a lot more common sense and enthusiaum.  We went a different route and did sort of a seafood platter that was pretty great but also pretty hard to mess up (unless you're Bluefin or Kingfisher, yuck!) My salad was offered to be split which was nice but was packed full of ingredients that we're listed but to me a real \"game-changer\", cucumber and zuccinni.  Can't stand them.  Poorly dressed.  I'm not gonna raise a stink but I figured I would of been asked when i only took a bite or two and then voice my issue with the salad but no one blinked... oh well.    Pretzles are always great! I'll be back for sure... best option BY FAR around the stadium!  Next time it will be a four star, I'd bet my life on it!",

We sat at the chef's bar, which overlooks the kitchen, which was nice because the chef gave us a little sampling of the Grilled Chicken Tabbouleh Salad, which was pretty good.  I ordered the chicken and corn chowder to start, which was delicious!  For my meal, I had the chopped salmon salad, which was good also.    Like I said, the food was good, but not great.  I'd like to try out this place for happy hour so I can try some more items.",

We were not disappointed! The staff had no problem with us holding down a table for the whole game, and we enjoyed the craft beers on tap as well as the delectable menu. Our favorite item was the burtcher's platter appetizer: there was plenty of everything to share, and we decided it was easily one of the best fancy cheese plates either of us had ever had. I had the AB cheeseburger for dinner, and it was also pretty near perfect. At the end of the game, we had the hot chocolate cake and coffee for dessert. The cake was delicious! Warm and very chocolate-y (this is not a molten chocolate cake, it just has a very hot cocoa taste). I also really liked the house coffee blend.  I highly recommend this place to anyone passing through downtown Phoenix.",

    "text": "My family stopped in here after a visit to the Arizona Science Museum on a weekday, early afternoon.  Our group ranged in age from 4 to 65 and included 2 kids and 3 adults.  There is a kids menu although it is not written down.  The kids menu includes mac and cheese, chicken fingers, cheeseburger, and one other item.  The server offered to put our kids' orders in right away (2 mac n cheese), which we greatly appreciated.  That dish was tasty enough for adults and kids alike.  It would have been even better if it had come with a small serving of fruit or veggies for a more balanced meal.    The 3 adults in our party shared the prosciutto appetizer, which also included some sliced bread and delicious sweet mustard concoction that i had never before tasted.  Yummy.  For mains we chose the turkey pastrami sandwich on a pretzel bun and side salad, chinese salad, and sweet potato tortelli.  The tortelli portion was a little small. But there wasn't much conversation after our food arrived because we were all enjoying our lunch too much to talk.  For dessert we shared the blueberry cheesecake, which featured crumbles on top.  1 was definitely not enough for our group, particularly because the kids loved it!  Fun ambience, good service, great food.  Thank you, downtown phoenix!",

It was  Friday night and it was busy. After about 15 minutes of no one coming over to even take our drink order we flagged down the hostess, who was mortified and immediately found our server, who gave us our first round of drinks on the house and was extremely apologetic. Then later the manager even came over to apologize and make sure we had gotten our free drinks. Classy move, Arrogant Butcher. Super classy move.  The food was good. I had the salmon which was delicious! - prices can add up quickly with the drinks. Was a great dinner for our short trip to Phoenix, but you could tell it was not a place the locals go to eat. Had a more touristy vibe. Would come back here again and definitely recommend to anyone traveling in the area!",

After looking at the menu we decided we would just have drinks and share an appetizer. \"We had the pretzel fondue appetizer which was okay.\" While I didn't taste all the menu items, just felt like the food was overly priced, or maybe seafood is just alot more expensive in Phoenix. The biggest disappointment was when I went to the bathroom to wash my hands and there was no soap in either dispensers. I mean isn't that a health code violation? In a place where they serve as much seafood as this place does, it was a bit disturbing that there was no soap. I mentioned this to the hostess as I was leaving, and she didn't seam to care.

I could have just eatne that!!!  OMG!!!  I did not want these appetizers to end...I told my friend that we just needed to order those again for the rest of our meal!!  She was like no you have to try the jambalaya!  I gave in of course...I was feeling too great from the drinks to argue and I love spicy food!  They brought the jambalaya out and I was in heaven!  I was spicy...spicy...and spicy!!! YUM YUM YUM!! I wish that it would not end!  It was so flavorful and delicious and I literally licked the bowl clean!  I also had another \"maid in mexico\"....then we split the peanut butter cup and gelato!!! OMG!! I wish this place was closer but its right downtown and it is in such a great location and its perfect!  Our server was awesome and just kept it so fun and fabulous the whole night! I will be back and I want this to become a regular place for me!  This is great for a date or for a group of friends!  I love it and I would recommend it to everyone!",

Every time we asked a question, the first person we asked had no answer so they got \"the manager\" of which they seem to have a lot. We were ignored for a long time, then when a server came, she seemed surprised to see us. The back room was noisy and they had a TV tuned to the Amazing Race--so annoying. When I asked them to turn it to something that wouldn't kill my brain cells or to turn it off, they put on ESPN news--not a game. The meat and cheese platter was very good. My husband and son had steaks which they said were average. I had the pork and beans which were really good, but overpriced. The peanut butter cup was \"to-die-for!\" Every one of their desserts had nuts in them and my son  is allergic to all tree nuts, so nothing for him. The wines were way overpriced and they had no dessert wines or after-dinner drinks. I wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "Went back to AB a few weekends ago, again for brunch, with a large group.  I was surprised to see that, although they advertise themselves as being a brunch place on the weekends, they have pared their menu down to basically 4 items.  The people that I invited that had never been to AB before were expecting more of a variety in brunch items since I'd told them that they had great brunch, but their concerns were quelled with a few bloody Marys and some good (if not diverse) food.  I had the egg sandwich sans bacon again (excellent again) and Sweet Pea and I split the french toast as well.  We'd only had a small sample of the french toast at the opening, so we didn't realize that it comes with this whole jar of cream and berries, in addition to the syrup.  If you come here for brunch and like french toast, you have to try it.  It's the best french toast I've ever had, and many at our table agreed.  The secret is that they bread it in cornflakes.  Yum.  And, the bloody Marys are in the excellent range, I'd say just below the phenomenal ones at Dick's/Rokerij.  The service was also friendly and quick.",

The pretzels are freshly made nuggets of perfection -- golden brown saltiness on the outside and tender on the inside. The cheese was the perfect match of savory creaminess. My coworkers ordered the steak, while I opted for the green chile pork stew. The stew is presented in a covered bowl with a side of homeade cornbread. Lift the lid and the beatiful stew, topped with a fried egg is revealed. My only regret is not having enough room for the warm peanut butter cup dessert. I'm only in town for a week, but I'm already planning a return visit.",

This place looks and sounds great. If I worked nearby this would be my local option for drinking. Staff are also pros and nice. Now let's get to the food. No joke, fire the chef. Not that the food is bad but it's just nothing specia i.e. bland. It sounds interesting but when it comes out you're like \" eh thats it?\" this place needs food that's WOW!! to match the rest of the package. Also you need to up the craft brew count.  For the record I had the rock shrimp appetizer - aka plain ole fried shrimp. And the beef rib stew - bland with very little meat and putting a fried egg on top didn't do much for the flavor either. Honestly the cornbread was the best part. Get a new chef and revamp the menu. Oh and they need a list of their hard liqour cause there's lots of bottles but only the bar manager knew what kind of scotch they had.",

Big bar area, all the top shelf liquor you would want. They have a raw bar with oysters, crab legs, and shrimp. The salads are big and awesome. This place has PRETZELS with PROVOLONE CHEESE for a starter.  They are perfectly golden brown little pretzel bites with melted provolone cheese. Freakin YUM!!! I have to say with a name like the Arrogant Butcher I was expecting lots of big cuts of grilled meat like, pork, beef, lamb, veal, fish etc, and the menu was disappointing in that area. I did go there for lunch so maybe the dinner menu has these things. I asked and our waiter said they do have more entrees on the dinner menu but did not specify, but that's OK cause we will be back to find out anyway. My girlfriend and I shared the Beef Stew and the Chicken Club Sandwich. I'll put it this way, the Beef Stew was probably one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. Oh my god, so much flavor, green chilies, huge pieces of tender steak. I have dreamed about this stuff since i went last week. This is another must get on there menu, $15 and worth every penny!!! The Chicken sandwich was good. Thick piece of chicken, thick bacon, Swiss, and the fixin's. I liked it alot. We are so going back for dinner!!!",

    "text": "Another top notch Fox restaurant. They do have the formula down. I cant say this place is anything really incredible or unique. But what it does it does very well. Its affordable. Its very trendy. The quality seems to be top notch. Service was excellent. Our dessert came out approximately 5 minutes after we ordered. It was delivered to us by the manager with apologies that it took so long and it was on the house. We had the warm peanut butter cup. I'm not a huge dessert person, especially chocolate ones, but it was good. The cookie on the side really deserves to be broken up and tossed in the bowl with the gelato. Getting back to the beginning of the meal, we had an appetizer of bacon potato fritters. They are amazingly light and airy. The taste of bacon was only slight. Everything is better with bacon right? The entrees were order were the ricotta dumpling bolognese and the meatloaf special. The dumpling were great. Again light and airy, almost slightly dry. A tad more moist and they could be gnocchi. The bolognese sauce were fairly oily. Most likely from the fat rendered from the cooking of the ground beef. I do think of myself as a meatloaf expert. I'm not easy to please. It was made perfectly. A perfect sweet glaze on top and a moist tender center. Nothing cutting edge with this. Just the basic meatloaf but done well. The mashed potatoes were a let down. I prefer my mashed potatoes on the rustic side. These were obviously whipped in some type of food processor. They get a slightly gluey texture when processed. We had a bottle of Stronghold Nachise with dinner. A great pairing for what we had. I was impressed they dont gouge you on wine prices. Their markup seems to be a more reasonable 100%. I've seen many places triple and quadruple the retail price of a wine. So kudos on that. I would def go back, but not right away. There are so many other places to try yet.",

After being seated about 8:30 pm on a Friday night, our server came and took our drink order. Then, another one came and took our food order. The original server was nowhere to be seen; we figured it was because the restaurant was getting quieter, and so they sent some of the staff home. No problem. But, after that, after delivering our food, the second waiter never came back. Several people had ordered iced tea of which none were ever refilled. Only waters were refilled. After our plates were cleared, we sat for a good 10 minutes looking for server to bring us the check. Eventually we had to snag a third server to bring us the check. Disappointing. I remember when the restaurant first opened. There was a large size crowd and sometimes a long wait. Now, you can walk right in and be seated (there were 5 of us). Hopefully the service will improve, because restaurants in this area compete fiercely for patrons. I hope the smaller crowd was not an indication that this restaurant is beginning to suffer.",

I love Fox restaurants but even though I've lived in Phoenix for 7 years had not tried this one. Just recently moved to downtown Phoenix and take the lite rail home. It's in a great location and I ordered the hummus which was outstanding. The people next to me ordered the pretzels and decided to order them next time. I also ordered the Rum drink and it was so good. A few days later, I was early for their Happy Hour but so hungry ordered lunch. I got the squash salad and it had an interesting ingredient...gingersnaps!! Delicious!  Also ordered the pretzels but there were so many, could not eat all of them so they were wrapped along with the cheese dip to take home. Service was outstanding and very nice atmosphere. I will definitely go to the Happy Hour again.   I was so impressed that I told a lot of my friends about this place too.",

    "text": "Fox restaurants typically are delicious, but people like myself and other Yelpers are weary of chain restaurants and although this is the only arrogant butcher and not a chain like Sauce or True Food its easy to lump it together into a \"chain restaurant motif\" being a Fox restaurant.  Fact of the matter is that's not fair, this unlike a quick in and out concept like Sauce, its a sit down restaurant that turns out to be excellent.   I've read reviews where people were disappointed with the quality, I think those people just drove out of there way maybe living in the west valley or something and amp'ed it up too highly, kinda like when you see a movie and it sucks then its better the next time.  Either way I've been here 3 times and every time had a delicious meal every time.  One thing that's really cool about this restaurant is that they give you an \"antipasto\" menu that looks like a sushi bar menu (single sheet of papter you can mark on with a pencil) full of various cheeses, meats and extras (grilled asparagus, olives, elephant garlic, $1 mussels, etc.) this allows you to get your appetizers going right away.  Whats great about this is not only the concept but the meats and cheeses are high quality and come with bread and jam that's honestly to die for, so delicious!  I could go for the antipasto menu alone.  To eat I've tried the turkey sloppy joe, which sounds dumb, in defense of the sandwich first off it was lunch and it came with a grilled poblano chili on top, it was amazing.  I've also for dinner tried the sweet baked potato tortellini (excellent) and my favorite thing so far which I will re order is the beef short rib stew with green chiles, fried egg, cornbread.  The flavor with the egg is mindbogglingly awesome and the cornbread is fresh, moist and delicious.  I've never had a bad meal and/or experience here, after here (as far as other bars @ citiscape) is a different story because I have an alcohol problem :)",

The $5 happy hour serving is definitely big enough for two people (about 10 pretzel rolls and at least an entire cup of melty yummy cheese). I don't think I'd want to eat a meal at the restaurant, just based on the menu, but I would happily get the pretzel & fondue again.",

It is slow and sometimes non-existstant. Some of the servers should be more friendly and take more enjoyment in their jobs. Overall, this place is okay. Will definitely give it another shot.",

We started with the hummus with veggies, pretzel bread and smoked provolone fondue, crispy bread, and the elephant garlic. Yum, yum, yum on the pretzel bread...we liked it so much we ordered it twice! It was excellent with the roasted elephant garlic...you like garlic you must order to elephant garlic! We decided to do lunch family style, so we also ordered the beet salad, jambalaya, and the short rib stew. Stew all the way...we ordered two it was so good with the fried egg on top. The jambalaya is spicy, so watch out...and the beet salad is refreshing. I truly enjoyed this well cooked meal. And you should too! Go eat here...you won't regret it!",

The interior is classic, clean, cozy, casual without being too slouchy and just enough class to keep you on your toes.  My mom was in town and we headed over for a simple dinner, we were greeted and seated quickly,  initially contemplating ordering from their charcuterie menu we decides on the burger and turkey sloppy joe, respectively, and split a small chopped salad.  The chopped salad was great!  Light fresh and crisp, tossed with the prefect amount of their house vinaigrette.   They made a little boo boo with the order, bringing my mom fish and chips and taking her burger to the next table but they eventually got it straight.  My turkey sloppy joe was tasty and I loved the roasted poblano pepper, the seasoning in the sloppy joe sauce was too much like the cumin laden taco seasoning I am not too fond of but it was still good. I was a big fan of the potato chips and the frys are quite crispy too.  I gave it 4 stars because I love having this quality addition to downtown.",

    "text": "So I have been here 3 times and I really wanted it to wow me each and every time but it simply doesn't.  First time I was with a friend and we were drinking more than eating so when my ridiculously expensive bill showed up I almost threw up all the $12.66 martinis I had drank.  Seriously?!?  The only place in town where I wouldn't freak on that price is AZ88 because one martini and you are almost done in.  Our server was friendly but I had to tell her to stop rushing us, she came back every 10 minutes or so wondering if we wanted our check.  I told her I would flag her down when needed but that we planned on being there a while. Second time I went for lunch and everything was ok but not amazing. Third time was last night and it will most likely be my last.  Every month 3 of my lady friends and myself try a new place, I actually was the one to suggest here. We started at the bar to have a cocktail while waiting for our whole party to arrive.  When it was time to move to a table our bartender asked us to close out our tab.  Didn't even offer to transfer it which is standard.  We ordered a started of cheese, roasted garlic, prosciutto, cornicons and oysters.  The little nugget of cheese we received was just that, a tiny little nugget.  Now I am a huge cheese snob, I have my very own travel bag from Venissimo Cheese shop in San Diego and every time I visit I come home with roughly $100 worth of cheese.  I know my cheese, I know the cost, I felt cheated that we each only got a nibble.  The oysters were good, not gritty at all, but there were a few staple accouterments that were missing, tabasco and crackers.  I ordered the beet salad which was middle of the road, but I did like that the beets didn't have a loamy taste.  One of my dining companions ordered the steak which was overcooked so she sent it back.  It came back better but with the same sides on the plate, they literally transferred what was on her original plate to the new one.  Terrible!  You don't let a plate sit under the heat lamp while you redo something, you make a whole new plate.  The worst part of the evening was after our appetizer our server informed us that it was almost 9 and the kitchen closes at 9.  WTF!?!  We are already seated, you know we are going to order dinner, there were at least 5 tables full in our section alone and you feel the need to rush our order?!?  Lame is a word that doesn't even do it justice.  To add the cherry on that lame sauce sundae, they kicked us out into the cold to wait for our ride!  It was freezing and all I had was a thin jacket WITHOUT gloves, I was shivering pretty bad by the time my fiance rolled up.  He was pissed that there were 4 women standing outside of the restaurant we just spent a pretty penny at and if there was a place to park he would have gone in himself to complain to the manager. (Thanks for looking out babe!) I will finish this off with the positives, they had cocktail onions.  You wouldn't believe how hard it is to find cocktail onion served in this town.  Second their system for splitting checks is hands down amazing with us each getting charged 1/4 of the appetizer price.  I haven't seen that before.  Third the decor is nice.",

    "text": "Was here couple days ago for a Pre-Xmas dinner get together with some girl friends. We waited about 25 mins or so before we got a table. We sat at the patio where the corner diagonal from the US Airway. Since there are heaters and the weather was not too cold so it was very nice and enjoyed the view. Everyone in our group ordered the Chicken Fried Pork Chop except me. I had the Scallops. When the food brought out together, the Scallops were cold. My guess was maybe they waited until all the food is ready and brought them out together and mine was the first one done and waiting for the rest to be cooked. Anyway, I was not going to mention to the waitress but my friend suggested that I should for what I am paying for. So I told one of the staff that was nearby and he was very nice and offered me that they can make me a new one and apologized for it. After about 10-15 mins later they brought a new plate and warned me the plate is very hot. This time the Scallops were too salty, I thought it might just me so I had a friend tried the cauliflower that came with and was salty as well. Since I was so hungry and everyone was done with their food so I didn't say anything to the waitress. Besides that, everything else was great. I highly recommend the Tabbouleh Salad and the desserts were good too. We had Warm Peanut Butter Cup and Blueberry Cheesecake.",

During my two visits it was extremely busy and even with a reservation, we still waited 30 minutes for a table - Issue 1. Issue 2 - this place has terrible staff. The bartenders and hostesses are rude and yes, I understand you are busy...but you can still smile and be nice!  I'm paying to be treated like crap?!? Bah...  After visiting the place twice for dinner I can say that the pretzel fondue is quite good.  I also liked the short rib dish as well as the crab stuffed chicken.  They are certainly onto something with the food, prices are so/so.  The wine options by the glass aren't very good and spendy for the quality that you get.  Besides, opting for a dirti 'tini makes the bar service a wee bit bearable.  I really, really wanted to like this place, but alas, it's another fantasitc idea that is executed sadly in poor downtown Phoenix.  Maybe some of the other options coming to CityScape this fall will fare better?  A girl can dream, can't she?",

I was able to make a reservations, which was super nice because we got in right away and the place was packed- it was awesome to just walk right in and be sat. I found the service to be quick and efficient, especially considering it was a very busy night.   The food is excellent... it is by far the best fox restaurant I've been to. Based on Yelp reviews we decided to split a couple things. We started off with the pretzel fondue and, like everyone else has said, it was BEYOND amazing. The pretzels were warm and fluffy and the cheese was sharp and tangy. Very, very good. We also shared a salad, which was fresh and tasty. Then, we had the green chili with a fried egg on top it was spicy, but the corn bread on the side was sweet so the combo was unbelievable. I would surly get it again.   Arrogant Butcher did NOT disappoint. I was so happy to get to try it and even happy with the amazing food and service we had.

    "text": "I love a good Fox restaurant. Let's be honest. They rarely let you down. I've been trying for months to get downtown to go to Arrogant Butcher, and was so excited when we finally had the time.   The decoration, as we've come to expect from Fox, was phenomenal. What a beautiful space. The pretzel fondue, while identical to the dish at Culinary Dropout, was just as delicious in it's reincarnation at Butcher.   The food was delicious, burgers cooked to perfection, the turkey sloppy joe is hearty and stays together, making it rather \"unsloppy\", etc.   The reason for my 2 star rating lies with the service. We made requests that were minor (no mayo, no lettuce, etc.), and every single edit we made was ignored. Usually an easy fix, when we brought it to the waiter's attention we were met with lots of attitude and not a lot of assistance. It's unfortunate, because downtown desperately needs more interesting and tasty options, and this one left me with a bad taste in my mouth.",

    "text": "I've decided that I like places where the menu is not 5 pages long. This way, you know what the restaurant is good for and known for and you go there for those specific items or specialties. Arrogant Butcher was a place that fits this description.   It's located in downtown Phoenix which is very close to US Airway center and the Chase ballpark. The place itself was quite huge with three different seating areas (the bar, main dining, and private rooms). The staff was nice overall and service was prompt because every server pretty much helps out each table. I know this may not seem like a huge factor but I liked it.   We ordered the pretzel and fondue which seems like a hit for everyone. it was good no doubt, but you would prolly get sick if you ate too much of it. As for the main course, I had the King crab cioppino which was excellent! Gf had the short rib stew which was also excellent. We polished those dishes until it was clean and was full with satisfaction.   Drinks were on the okay side. I had an old fashioned which was kinda watered down. Overall though, it was a very enjoyable experience with the food being the best part. Will definitely repeat again!",

I really liked the feel of the place as soon as I came in, very modern and industrial-looking. Although the hostess was missing, a waiter saw me looking confused and immediately seated me. He was very friendly and sent a waitress over quickly; I wish I could remember her name, she was really personable, too.  I ordered the short rib stew, and the waitress said it was her favorite dish. I can see why! I'm not a big fan of spicy food, but I took a chance since I'm in the southwest. It was incredible! The meat melted in your mouth, and the fried egg was the perfect touch. And the cornbread? I would go on a Zombieland style, shotgun-toting Twinkie-run for that cornbread, it was that good.  This place might be a little pricy, but it is worth every penny. There is a lot of thought that goes into their menu and food preparation. I hope I have some excuse to come back to Phoenix just so I can eat at AB again!",

The salmon \"rilette\" was basically just salomn and mayo (with good bread). My scallop entree had enough well seared scallops to make me happy,  but was supposed to come with Brussels sprouts and if there was more than one on my plate I missed it somehow.  My boyfriend seemed to like his chicken with crab and generally the whole meal more than me. Overall, a nice patio downtown and close to things, but overpriced with disappointing food.",

We were greeted by a nice host.  Nice, friendly and good vibe inside.  We were seated after only a 10 minute wait.  I was liking this place already.   The fresh baked pretzels with fontina fondue was so good.  If gluten overloae gives you the bloat, then pass on this one.  My hubby and cutie pie decided to share the fish and chips, they obviously liked a lot.   After seeing the green chile pork stew on the cover of Phoenix magazine, I had to try it.  Topped with fried egg.  How can it fail?  Aaahh...after eating, I want to take a nap on the comfy booth.  I can't wait to go back to try other items on the menu!!!",

There were so many things to choose from that sounded good, and based on our experience, we will have to go back to try more, as we were very happy with what we selected.  We also shared our meals so both had the opportunity to try more.  We started with a little tray of grilled asparagus and olives and cheddar cheese that was served with crusty bread and delicious jam.  We shared the scallops, which were very well prepared and flavorful, and the New York strip steak that was served with an amazing horseradish sauce.  The food was amazing and the service was totally up to par.  We opted to sit out on the patio, which was also very enjoyable.

A combo of sweet, creamy and slightly salty with a smooth texture, reminiscent of creme brulee.

The Waldorf salad was ok, but not much flavor at all.  My entree was recommended, it was chicken stuffed with crab.  Only ok.  Huge serving, it was probably enough for two.  Seemed like two chicken breasts breaded and fried, with crab in between.  Very good but not great, I would have preferred a smaller more tasty portion.  All in all a nice dinner, abiance was fantastic, but I must have made bad ordering choices because my meal was not as great I expected it to be from the looks of this place, it was pretty packed!

Tried the zucchini fritters while waiting for entrees. The sauce it was paired with made it truly mouth watering. I ordered the jumblaya. It was a big portioned bowl with just the right amount of spice. My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak cooked medium- he said it was the best he'd had in awhile! So marinated, he didn't even need sauce. The patio was very clean however there is a lot of traffic on the corner.. The women's restroom was also very clean, I wasn't a big fan of the lighting but it was very trendy, and spacious. With chairs and a full body mirror. Our waitress was very attentive but not hovering- making sure to refill drink or clear plates as soon as we were done with them. After being offered dessert, we were given the check and didn't wait long at all to have our card back and attend our game.",

We wanted to order more but the server presented the check and hurried away before we got a chance. She did not go to socialize or check her phone she was working with another table. I understand that \"turning and burning\" is the way servers can maximize their income but we still wanted to eat a little more.

The atmosphere here is super casual and a nice mix of professionals dropping in for a quick bite, as well as families and friends.  We were promptly greeted and sat at an outside table.  It was a bit breezy and sunny, maybe some sun shades would help with this, but I also didnt notice whether they had them or not. Our waiter was awesome, efficient and knowledgable.  The gentleman I was with asked about the crab stuffed chicken and then decided to order the tacos.  BORING! I got the salmon, mashed potatoes and broccollini, and it was divine.  Every time I patron Arrogant Butcher I order something different and I am never disappointed.  We also had a dozen oysters, I love the price point on these as well.  The only complaint this time around was that I had A LOT of shell to spit out with each one.  That is the only reason for 4 stars. Ill keep this review short and sweet and encourage you to try Arrogant Butcher if you havent already.  You wont be dissatisfied with anything that comes out of this \"scratch\" kitchen.",

Frustrating to wait on your server who is more interested in chatting with fellow employees than paying attention to his tables- especially when the place is practically empty.",

What you call your Short Rib Stew is a bean  chili with a few teaspoon sized pieces on beef in it. Sure, there was a few green things in there that you want to call green chili but, it wasn't in a green chili sauce. I mean if you are going to call it green chili because, there are a few green chili pieces in the re ole then why not call it bean soup?  I had to return it for the clam chowder or what should be called milk potato soup. The broccoli side dish was good but, then I got a few piece of broccoli that had a tremendous amount of salt on it.   This place is over rated and Overly talked about by nearby hotels. Truth is in the first name of this restaurant.",

My Uber driver told me that she gives tons of rides to this spot which made my excitement level jump to a 12 outta 10 (I think I found a winner)  I was seated right away outside with a beautiful view of the mountains. I ordered the smoked salmon as my starter and the 805 on draft.  It was great way to begin the meal. The brioche was drizzled with olive oil and the salmon could be easily spread across.  For my main entree I ordered the scallops. It took me awhile to decide on them as I had never had scallops before and just heard the sad stories of them being the overcooked and rubbery.  But I trusted their #1 ranking and went for it! They were spectacular, caramelized on the outside and nice and tender on the inside. They came with some roasted sweet potatoes and like a broccoli slaw, all with a reduction sauce. It was really nice.   The only thing that was keeping me from giving this a five star review was, as my name states I'm always on a hunt for a deal. I thought the portion of my scallops were a tad on the small side for what I paid for them and knew I would have gone hungry had I not ordered the starter.   But overall really a great place and would highly recommend.",

I also had a Blood Orange Palermo.  So yummy and refreshing. Dinner was the pork schnitzel and Mac & cheese....again, just can't say enough good things about.",

As it was busy, getting  service was spotty, and we had to ask for a few things.

The staff is dressed in what I would imagine a butcher would wear under his smock, Dark pants, white shirt, suspenders, looking very trendy and sharp.  We opted to sit at the bar, he had a hamburger, I had their cubano. It was delicious, and the portions weren't too much or too little. The bartender was friendly enough, and march madness was on the television.   There was nothing that really made this place amazing, but it was really good. We met some great folks, and had a great time chatting it up with them!   If I found myself in the downtown area again, I would gladly re-visit the Arrogant Butcher.",

The restaurant is always a little loud, but with the pre-gaming Diamondback and Cubs fans there it was exceptionally loud.  This didn't really bother me as I wasn't there for an intimate dinner, but for some diners this may be a turn off.   Our server was fantastic, getting us drink refills right on time and checking in when one of our food items didn't make it to the table with the rest of the food. Our food was delicious. We had shrimp, oysters, and the butchers board to start. I loved the green sauce that was served with the oysters and have never had anything like that anywhere else. For entrees we had the crab stuffed chicken, prime rib, and spicy shrimp (from the appetizer list but served as an entree). The only problem we had was our shrimp dish did not make it to the table until two of us were nearly done with our meals. Our server handled it very well, was apologetic and removed it from our bill. When we come back I hope to have the same server as the level of service really seems to make or break some of our visits to Arrogant Butcher.",

To be really honest, I was very disappointed with the portion in comparison to the price point. For my steak salad, I literally felt so hungry after which is never usually the case.

Ok enough of them, everyone talks about them, now onto other things I tried. The artichoke hummus with olives & tomatoes and flatbread, yes that was good, was it memorable, no, it was ok.  Also tried the chicken liver pate with pickled onions toast, my friend ordered these because she wanted to try it, I was game, my 1st bite was great, the red pickled onions and the pate mixed together was a perfect blend, but the 2nd bite, that's where it turned way too salty for me to enjoy.   Now the local ricotta & roasted peppers toast was so delish! It was toasted perfectly, the ricotta & peppers with balsamic vinegar was omg cosmic, was very very sad when it had disappeared!   Yep I think the next time I am their I am just getting the pretzel fondue & ricotta & roasted peppers toast haha oh and I heard The Fix is the drink to get!",

Though the lunch menu items looked good, we had our eyes set on the Crab Stuffed Chicken dish on the dinner menu, and our waiter made I happen for us! I'm so glad he went above and beyond to ask the kitchen to accommodate us, because we were not disappointed! The chicken had a crisp breading and was stuffed with just the right amount of crab in the center. The cream sauce with capers was light and tasty, though next time I'd ask for some extra sauce.   Also, most restaurants don't have Super Tuscan wines by the glass, especially for $10. Huge plus!",

Just by the name, you automatically know that this is NOT a place for Vegans or Vegetarians, let alone in someone who's on a plant based diet.   I've been here twice, once for lunch and again for dinner, big time in a group and it was just plain good. Can get busy, so if you walk in at a peak time, you may have to wait 15 - 20 minutes, so if you're on a schedule its best to book in advance. No parking validation is probably my only gripe as its downtown diagonally across from the Talking Stick Arena where the Phoenix Suns and Mercury play so you may end up either paying an arm and a leg to park or have a bit of a walk. GameChanger: Look for an area that is a short distance away that you don't have to pay to park and use an Uber, Lyft or other ride share.  May be cheaper than parking and if you strategically park in a location that is safe, but can get you out of the traffic that is leaving faster. It could be a win-win.",

    "text": "This place is absolutely fantastic! My boyfriend and i have dubbed this place our \"Sunday Spot\" for a number of different reason.   My boyfriend and I always sit at the bar, so of course i could start by saying they have an excellent drink menu. They have specialty cocktails that are all carefully hand crafted and delicious. I am more of a wine drinker, and the wine list is perfect for anyone with a sophisticated pallet. My boyfriend has a little less knowledge about wine and the bartender took the time to help him to find a wine that he would like. Brent is another reason we come to this place. He is an amazing bartender and incredibly knowledgeable and skilled at his craft.   Moving along to the food. I have yet to order something here that I have not enjoyed. Everything had been so tasty!! If you're in the mood for some comfort food you have to try the meatloaf. It is so delicious and the portion is perfect. If you have decided on wine with dinner, I would recommend trying the cheese board. It was fantastic and a little different then ones I have had before in the best way. Even the dessert is amazing.   I have nothing bad to say about this place and we both have told multiple people about it and have suggested to our bosses that it is a great place to go for a business lunch. Do yourself a favor and try this place. You will not regret it.",

They also have a full bar with plenty of seating for you and your friends. They only negative we had was that most of our meals were on the salty side. Food portions were just right. Even for being a very busy lunch time it was a pleasurable. Can't wait to try The Arrogant Butcher for dinner.",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  Generally, I'm a fan of Fox restaurants.  I wanted to give this place 4 stars, but based upon our last couple visits in the last couple weeks, I'm sorry to give it a very average 3-star review.  What does this place do right?  Like all Fox restaurants, the atmosphere is great.  Nice patio, nice interior, cool vibe.  Also, the price point is quintessential Fox.  Above average prices, but not too high, especially considering this is his chophouse concept.    It's the service and the food that got to me these past couple times.  Service has been . . . uneven.  Both dinners were pre-concert, so we let our server know.  Ordered only entrees and it took an extraordinary amount of time to get the food before we scarfed it down and rushed out the the door.  Second time, server was more efficient but pretty inattentive.  On visits previous to these, I've sat at the bar and gone for lunch, and service then has been great.  As for food, last two visits I ordered the chicken stroganoff and the fish & chips.  The stroganoff was bad.  I appreciate the house-made noodles, but they were overcooked in a thin, watery, very bland sauce.  Two smallish pieces of chicken.  This, after the long wait, was disappointing.  Second visit, the fish & chips.  Came out piping hot and the flavor was fine, but, they over-fried them and let them sit in the deep fryer.  They were extremely greasy.  Crispy, but greasy.  Not that I'm expecting health food from fish & chips, but this was a bit too much.  In the past, I've ordered the brussel sprout salad and kale salad, both were excellent.  The nachos were huge and pretty tasty, and they have the old Culinary Dropout standby of the pretzel bites with cheese fondue, which are also tasty.    I wouldn't dissuade anyone from going.  It's location is pretty perfect for music and sporting events and the food is generally fine.  Though it doesn't stand out from the the rest of the Fox crowd, and there are some kinks to work out, thus the 3-star review.",

The meatloaf was perfectly delicious, better than lots of other meatloaf I've had, but it was still meatloaf. Haha. I'm not sure why were expecting anything beyond that. We saw some of the other dishes that people around us ordered and slightly regretted our choice to go with the meatloaf. Again, there was nothing wrong with it, but we definitely could've ordered something more exciting. Next time!",

We said we would take a first available seating, was a little apprehensive about sitting outside but it could not have been any better.  We had the perfect table, the weather was perfect, people watching at it's best and we had the best meal ever.  Our server was so attentive and her suggestions perfect.  Thank you Arrogant Butcher!

Definitely order the pretzels w/ cheese fondue if you go here, it is a must.    For the charcuterie, ordered the prosciutto, truffle cheese, olives and deviled eggs.   While it was not bad, I have had much better.   It was all a la carte and definitely not worth $22.  For dinner, the waitress recommended the crab stuffed chicken.   I thought it was going to be a big chicken breast stuffed w/ crab and cheese.   Instead it was two dry thin breaded pieces of chicken with crab in between.   It was just ok.  For a side note.  A co-worker of mine ordered the scallops and said they were great.    Not sure if I will be back, unless already in the area for something else (concert or game)",

Great location in the cleaner/trendier part of downtown.  Great concept and really liked the open kitchen and floorplan.  Place was bustling and the service was crisp and keeping pace.  Just had the iceberg wedge lunch salad which was great - the standard topping (bacon and tomato) plus glazed short rib, chopped egg and avacodo.  Dressing was a very flavorful buttermilk blue cheese.  Nice serving size and everything fresh and tasty.  The lunch menu had plenty of nice options (the beef short rib stew sounded good but 110 degrees doesn't feel like stew weather to me) and everything that passed by us on its way to other tables really looked good.  Small group of 4 and everyone fully enjoyed their lunch.    As mentioned, service was very good and the place was jammed.  Despite the crowd, it was very easy to have a table conversation. Very much looking forward to coming back when I'm not as pressed for time and can enjoy dinner and some of the very good looking cocktails.",

Gave our name and number at the Host stand. The gal was polite. Not a long wait, and they text you instead of giving you one of their pagers (brilliant, and a cost savings for them). We were seated and waited a long while before a very sweet gal named Kayla approached us. She offered to get us drinks, explained the menu, and said she'd get drinks and our waiter. I guess there was a little confusion  (or no one wanted a 2 top), so she came back and said that she'd be our server.   She helped us pick dinner, we were both torn between 2 different items. My hubs got the Short Rib Stew and said it was really good (and loved the green Chiles). I was torn between the burger and the Chicken Tabouli, she suggested I get the burger and Chicken Tabouli salad as a side. I am SO glad I did! The burger was 'meh (which surprised me, expected more knowing the name of the restaurant). The Chicken Tabouli salad was FanTasTic! Loaded with Feta cheese and almonds and all sorts of goodness.  Kayla was absolutely wonderful. She was polite, gracious, listened, and made suggestions when we asked. That is hard to find in a server and we appreciated it!  Yes I'd go again. No I wouldn't bother with the burger (Smash Burger is way better)  Yes I'd get the Chicken Tabouli salad again!",

I may be a seafood snob having lived on the east coast a long time, but damn, there is no water anywhere near and these people are sserving up raw oysters in July.  Ya don't eat oysters if there isn't an \"R\" in the month; and in the South , March/April are still shady months to eat them.  Um, no.  I ordered the \"Famous Chinese chicken salad\".  I'm not sure why it's famous because it's flavorless.  To me, Asian based salads as such should have more of a peanut presence. Nada.  No seseme, peanut, cilantro. It was rather bland. Fresh, but bland.  I did enjoy the meat/cheese board appetizer.   I love Fox restaurants, but I have to say , based on my one experience it was just so so.  I'd give it another try, however.  My service was impeccable, the food was fresh; but perhaps I ordered wrong. (not as wrong as people who eat oysters in the desert in July though)",

Last time we came for later dinner Saturday 9pm - we were seated ordered food (that was not very good except oysters - surprisingly wonderful). After 15 mins of our plates being laid down on the table THE LIGHTS CAME UP - to announce that it is time for us to go.

I wasn't particularly hungry, so I just got bread, but I knew that my table mates wouldn't be able to finish the massive amount of food they ordered so I was just fine. As we sat down I asked my server (his name was Phoenix),  if he could change the channel of the TV so I could watch the big playoff game and he immediately complied to my needs. Phoenix informed me that he was a Gemini, and I am not particularly fond of male Gemini's, but this one had just the right amount of sarcasm and wit to the point where he was likable, but not annoying. The bread was fantastic, it was laced with lines of balsamic extract and olive oil. On top of a cheese sauce dipping it was some of the best bread I've had in my young life. Other than that, everybody at my table thoroughly enjoyed their food, especially the dessert. My experience at the Arrogant Butcher was nothing life-changing, but I enjoyed my time there and I give it a solid 4 stars.",

This wouldn't have been an issue if the servers would have left the door closed, but this seemed to be an action somehow about the skill of their pay grade.  Normally that would have been enough to make me get up and leave. I am so glad I didn't.  The Hemingway daiquiri was spot on. A daiquiri isn't supposed to be insanely sweet or sugary, and they got it there. It was sour like it was supposed to be, and high in citrus. I got a drink and my vitamin C for the day. That's WINNING! in my book.  Then they brought out the soft pretzels and gruyere fondu. Holy hell, that was brilliant and delicious. Someone finally came up with a \"foodie\" version of one of my favorite classics of garbage eating.  After my pretzel-gazm I was offered up the skirt steak with green beans, bacon and fingerling potatoes. And again, I was blown away. I don't normally like skirt steak as it tends to be a bit chewey and hard to get through. Not so at Arrogant. It was just right. Not so tender it imploded when the fork hit it, but not so tough that your dentures would come loose if you visited this place from Sun City.   Arrogant Butcher is exactly what down town Phoenix needed. Its smart, the food is good, the service is on point, and its different. I woulda gone 5 stars if it wasn't for being sat next to the TV room.",

Four Peaks beers were $14 for two beers - thank goodness my lunch companion was drinking lemon water. $50 for lunch is steep, but it would have okay if the food and service was friendlier and service speed was up to par. It took 18 minutes to be served from the time we were seated(we timed it), and then another 20 minutes for food to be served a burger and french dip. Food we ordered because we thought they'd be served fairly fast. The AB was moderately crowded with business types and ASU students/staff on their lunch hour and has a pleasant decor. Very trendy indeed. We were able to wolf-down our lunch and head back to the Student Center at ASU for our meeting in an hour. Not a relaxing meal - again, slow service, loud atmosphere (turn down the music - it's lunchtime, not happy hour!), and expensive and very forgettable food. Do not recommend - there are MUCH better options for a good lunch in central Phoenix - at a lower price point.",

Since they were gracious enough to extend Happy Hour to the group I grazed my way through most of the appetizers and enjoyed them all! I really like their \"toast\" aka bruschetta offerings. I was even daring enough to try the chicken pate toast and was surprised at how flavor that one was, the pickled onions on top of it were sweet and crunchy perfectly contrasting the smooth and salty chicken liver! Yum! If you want to imbibe and don't  really enjoy the harshness of strong alcohol but want that \"lifted\" feeling I would highly recommend getting \"The Fix\" that baby is smooth!

Extremely busy and understaffed, we got there in time for happy hour, but didn't receive a happy hour menu, and no one came by. We waited and waited, and were able to only place one drink order. This took 15 minutes to come to the table. Some of our appetizers were missing. We ordered a smoked garlic toast, and it came in a mason jar of oil with some garlic in it.. and no toast. They were confused when we ordered toast for it, saying that was not how it was served. Um, okay. The salmon rillette was pretty decent, as was the provolone fondue with pretzel bread (served also at Cuilnary Dropout). But we were really disappointed. Zucchini was a bit on the soggy side (probably having sat for a while) and the hummus was mediocre. Have more staff on game days! The server was also incredibly irritating, rambling on about their oyster specials and all kinds of other things before we could even order a drink. We had to get a busboy to actually bring us our drinks in the end. Just unfortunate.",

I had the steak special and my wife had the lemon stuffed chicken. Both meals were excellent with just the right portions. We were full bit no stuffed. Kudos to the staff as the restaurant got crowded they we never lacked in service and did not have anyone loud or obnoxious by us.

We asked a few people for recommendations and everyone pointed us in the direction of The Arrogant Butcher.  We were not disappointed.  They are dog friendly and the food was great!  We split the Waldorf salad, ordered oysters and split the meatloaf special.  The salad was fresh and tasty, the oysters were sooooooo good!  They give you three sauces to choose from which made it interesting - all three were great.  The meatloaf served with beans and mashed potatoes were awesome.  The best thing is that they split the plates without us ever asking them (for an extra plate to do ourself).  I love it when you get a great waiter - ours was Brian - an Arizona native.  He was wonderful!  We did have drinks - I don't remember the names but their version of a Mojito was awesome!  It was a beautiful night and we really had a great time!  Oh - and desserts - we had the peanut butter and one of the chocolate ones (again - I don't remember the names) and they were really good too!!!!  When I come back to Phoenix to visit my daughter this will be a must.  I loved every aspect of this restaurant!",

Wife and I had our choice of places to visit in our first time downtown Phoenix to eat in years....The reviews were so in Arrogant's favor, yet really let me down, wife was satisfied....  It is obvious by the other 400 reviews that the Butcher just had a bad night with us.  Told we would be seated in 10 min, they forgot us and did not even have us on the list.  Had to ask three times for water, brought all of our food out at once, that would be cheese, salad, oysters, and our dinners, even though we asked to be sure to pace our meal.  Did not give us the \"upgraded\" wine list.  Did not have Med-rare piece of prime rib, sent back, and was charged twice for the meat.    It must have all just been a big mistake, cause everyone else has had a great experience!  We won't be back.",

    "text": "We came in extra early for dinner on the way to an event. The place was packed and on a wait with mostly sports enthusiast also on the way to an event. That normally is a good sign that things should be running well. I did notice the hostess using great restraint not filling every single table to pace the kitchen. Eventually we got seated, my husband ordered a drink off the drink menu, I thought they might run too sweet so I ordered what I thought was a common drink that you can get anywhere a bloody mary. The waiter comes back very apologetic and tells me they don't have the ingredients to make a bloody mary and hands me the drink menu so real fast I picked skinny mojito not realizing it was raspberry flavored because I picked it out too fast and didn't read it all. He brings it over and the color is bubblegum pink. So I tried it and there was no way anyone anywhere can drink this drink, it really was that bad the chemical taste was overwhelming. IT WAS THE WORST DRINK I EVER TASTED ANYWHERE and I wasn't even able to chug it for a buzz. I do note my husbands drink was drinkable but left an after taste in my mouth and he also couldn't believe how horrible the raspberry mojito was.  We decided to share and start with two cheeses that come with two chunks of bread each and a tiny pot of rasp berried cherries. This was the highlight of the meal and I am not a fan of rasp berried cherries. However the cheeses and bread was fresh cut to order and that is how it should be done.  When we finished my waiter did notice I pushed away the drink and asked me if I wanted to try another drink. I said no, I will just drink water and he took it away. (and off the bill)  I decided to try the salmon and envisioned it tasting good with apples and farro. But what I received was less than a dieters portion as a whole, the fish had a nice sear on it but wasn't as fresh as I like and was a little over cooked but edible. A very small amount of spinach and fennel garnished the fish that was approximately a tablespoon total. I could tell just by looking at the farro it wasn't cooked. I was brave and decided to try the farro and it was undercooked being very chewy and also was what I am thinking might have been end of the pan because it also was HARD AND CRUNCHY and I could have damaged my teeth eating it. I also wasn't a fan of the flavors because this entree was as sweet as dessert. Little tiny light like small water chestnut shape things were elevating the salmon and they was odd, honestly I thought they were water chestnuts but they turned out to be the apples that I forgot about. I doubt that this dish is suppose to be this was and do chalk it up to them being massively busy and running out of food. But this dish WAS A TRAIN WRECK and I was steaming over the crunchy farro that was HARD to chew.  My husband had the jambalaya, he said the chicken in it was very dry and he thought all the ingredients were cooked separately and then just tossed together.  We were checked on when we were finished at that point I really didn't feel like bringing up the farro after that traumatizing pink drink.  My husband meant well and was sorry he picked this place for dinner.",

I was trying to find a place downtown so that I can meet up my play step-dad ...lol, he was out in Phx on business (my mothers boyfriend-they have been together forever and a day) I thought what the hell let me check this place out. I love that the location was downtown. I am never  in downtown Phoenix on a Friday, so I thought it would be hella busy. Well well, it was hardly nobody down there. I guess I am use todowntown in Chicago (use to live there for some years before moving to Phx) or Los Angeles (grew up there, because these downtown cities are busy all the time.  Well, when we arrived there was no wait, well I did may reservation on Open Table, but still even if I hadn't we still would have been seated right away because it was not busy. I would guess if there was a game going on that day, it would have been a different story. Anyway, we ordered the pretzel bites with cheese, I thought it was good because I was hungry but after a well I found that the cheese was to heavy and thick for me, but still alright.  I had the jambalaya it was cool. I did enjoy the ambiance of the restaurant.  I just was not blowed away by this restaurant at all. It was not bad, I am just not sure if I will ever come here again. Maybe if I am downtown one day. I believe I was more blowed away by the simplicity of getting downtown and just hanging out down there.",

One of our group checked Yelp and after seeing (and reading) the great reviews we packed up our rental and headed to The Arrogant Butcher.  We were greeted and seated promptly.  We were off to one side of the restaurant (probably due to the size of the group) and that was just fine.  We were a little noisy.  Chris was our server.  He has a great personality and was the perfect fit for a group like ours.  He recommended some drinks and appetizers, took our beverage order and was back in no time with a tray of cold drinks for all of us.  We only ordered one appetizer-the Pretzel bites with cheese fondue.  Very Yummy!!  Our orders were all over the board, sandwiches, burgers, salads and entrees.  All the meals were delicious.  I had the turkey pastrami sandwich and loved it!  No desserts so I can't give a review there but we were so happy we choose this restaurant.   I can't say enough about Chris.  He was informed about the menu and drinks, provided quick service, and had a spontaneous wit that had us busting up with laughter.  We only get to Phoenix once or twice a year but we will definitely be coming back to The Arrogant Butcher when we are here.",

I think we probably just went on an off day and we may give it another shot if we make it back down town sometime. We had high hopes, AB has been on our radar for a bit now and it was really decent except that each dish really had one minor problem or another. Food network has turned America into a bunch of wanna be food critics who imagine themselves on the set of Chopped when ordering lunch/dinner.  Look at me and \"call my guilty\" but hey, I am the one paying to go out so I can say what I want right?. Hmmm.... Location is good and the place is definitely beautiful, clean, modern, awesome. We were seated right away and had great service throughout the meal. The antipasto meat and cheese was the best thing we ate...We got the ham, blue cheese, olives and garlic...you can go through and make your plate however you want (like ordering sushi) -very clever. The bread was fantastic, grilled, warm, soft...our only complaint was the garlic had gone a little long and got that bitter taste but overall this was good (could be Great!). I ordered a strawberry lemonade...granted the server did advise after the fact that they are working to perfect the recipe, but this was nothing short of horrible.  Watered down, lack of strawberry and just overall lack of flavor. $4 for this, I think not. You would be better off with pink lemonade from the coke machine...Come on Fox, I know you have a good recipe floating around somewhere, this needs help! Our server was great and took it off our bill. Okay so main dish...My wife got the famous Chinese chicken salad. It was everything it should be, fresh greens, good dressing, nice crisp won-tons except the chicken was very dry and tasted like it was prepared much earlier. I had the jambalaya which had amazing flavor but was way way way too spicy. I like heat, I'm not a spice baby either...you will find some crazy spice guy who would love you for this dish but overall you have to remember your target audience here....It was so hot I could not eat it. The sausage is amazing, the shrimp were nice and cooked perfectly, the rice was excellent...it was just lost to the spice. Burn me now, burn me later kinda dealeo. - Don't take my ramblings to suggest it was bad, it was not by any stretch....I just know how much better this team of fine individuals could, and most likely will, make it be.",

We were supposed to get a couple of slices of bread but had to ask three times and wait ten minutes to get it - by then the entrees had been sitting there for five minutes.  The Thursday night chicken special - highly recommended by our waiter -  was basically \"OK.\"  The  short rib stew was a bowl of gray gravy with very little in it - really had to search for any evidence of short rib meat - a few very small bites were finally located.  The locatiion is terrific - sitting on the patio people watching before a Suns game was enjoyable.  The waiter was reasonably attentive except for the bread problem.  Definitely wouldn't go back.",

    "text": "Disappointed.  We were \"greeted\" by a semi-rude gentleman and when we decided to sit on the patio seemed to dismiss us immediately.  Our waiter was friendly, but never came back to check on us after our drinks and appetizers were served.  We were soooo excited to try the fondue and onion dip, but were sorely disappointed in both!  The fondue was super salty and \"processed\" (like cheese you get in those school fundariser crocks), and the onion dip was a less than perfect rendition of Knorr soup mix.  Overall, great location, but probably won't recommend or go back.",

    "text": "Hey Everyone.....had dinner there last night, 2/26.  LOVED IT..  The restaurant itself, very downtown urban modern, clean, bathrooms were spotless at the time of my visit.  Reading other reviews there were several mentions of the Pretzels w/ the Fondue.  C'mon...pretzels and cheese, what's not to love.  This appetizer didn't disappoint, pretzels were hot and fresh, didn't have that 'just thawed' taste, the cheese sauce AWESOME!   We also had the white shrimp from the raw bar.  At $3 dollars a piece i thought was a little pricey, with that said they were terrific.  HUGE, plump and fresh, the taste was truly great.  My only bad thing to say about the shrimp was the 'shell on', had i thought to ask i would have asked that they peel the shrimp before brining it out.  It's a personal pet peeve of mine of having to take the shells off shrimp.  For out main meal we shared the Saturday night special which was baby back ribs and the grilled swordfish.  The swordfish was served with some kind of barely side dish, VERY good, the fish was terrific, would definitely get this again.  We were split on baby back ribs. They had a heavy char on them, which i loved my friend wasn't crazy about them but said they had a good flavor.  The meat literally fell off the both with almost no effort at all.  The service was very very good, our server Steph M, was very attentive w/o being intrusive, which can sometimes be a fine line.  Our drinks were NEVER empty, which is HUGE, we tend to drink a lot of iced tea while we eat.  On a side note, they have signs pointing for parking for the restaurant.  A sign at the exit of the elevators would be a great help.    Can't wait to go back.....i hope this place makes it!  Ciao everyone!",

Service was a little slow but nothing to complain about. Came here for lunch on a weekday and it wasn't crowed but busy enough to do some people watching. We sat out on the patio because it was nice out. They have a solid lunch menu with creative entrees, meats and cheeses, and unique sandwiches and salads. We ordered the humus appetizer and it was really good. It had halved cherry tomatoes and big chunks of artichoke heart and kalamata olives. I ordered the beef short rib stew (with green chile, white beans, and a fried egg on top) and it came with cornbread. I loved it. My lady ordered a salmon salad and liked it a lot. I ordered some of their house cocktails too and they were pretty good. I had the candlestick maker and the old fashioned. I was a little surprised the bill was $75 for lunch, but hey... it was worth it.",

    "text": "Went to the arrogant butcher last night as a belated birthday dinner with my love. Had a somewhat difficult time getting there, its on a one way street, we parked at the garage underneath the location. Thankfully they validated parking. Inside is decorated like TGI Fridays, looks very casual dining to me, but the prices don't reflect the casual atmosphere.   He ordered the Thursday special which was fried chicken and biscuit. He seemed to like it although he didn't eat it all, he ate all the coleslaw but there was half a chicken breast and a chicken leg leftover as well as half the biscuit. I personally didn't love the honey drizzled over the lightly battered chicken skin. I guess that's an acquired taste.  I had the filet mignon which for $36 should not have been dry like it was . I did order it medium well, but that usually leaves me with a little moistness. Despite being dry it was very tasty. I liked the potatoes and creamed spinach that came with it. I absolutely loved the cocktail that I ordered called Butchers Blood and Sand. The waitress asked me what kind of drinks I usually like and I told her that lately I've been drinking Manhattans. She said I would probably like this drink and she was correct. It came like a martini and it had a wonderful unique creamy and sweet flavor, not as strong as a Manhattan but delicious none the less. It includes pigs nosed scotch, cherry heering, Carpano Antica, orange juice, clove and orange bitters.   We had no room in our belly for dessert.   My server was very good about checking up on us and making sure we enjoyed our dinner. Overall I would give this place a 3.5 maybe cause I was looking for something a little more formal and partly because my meat was dry. This was not a cheap meal it came to $96 including tip for 2 people.",

There was only one person working behind the bar so the service was  a bit slow.    I ordered an iced tea and the Chopped Salmon Salad (<a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/the-arrogant-butcher-phoenix?selected=btFQyXf2UcCAS_X5F5zHeg#OIWtDNNlHFG-m1lmJaEztQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/the-...</a>).  I was expecting a warm, juicy, piece of salmon on a bed of Kale, but the salmon was actually cold and smoked.  The salmon was on the saltier side, and I wish the menu let you know the salmon is smoked in the description.  The salad was made with kale, cauliflower, currants, almonds, and champagne vinaigrette.  The salad was okay, but the dressing was a bit overpowering in my opinion.  Overall, it was a salty salad with salty salmon.  I should have gone with the braised short rib stew..",

I asked our waiter if I could just have grilled chicken and steamed vegetables and he immediately said it was no problem. I wasn't expecting much and when everyone else at my table had been served before me, I was jealous of what I saw and was thinking mine will be so plain- After laughing with my table, my food arrived- and what I was presented with was amazing!! Not only did it look beautiful but it tasted fabulous! I told our waiter how good it was and how surprised I was that I got such an amazing dish- he told me he left it up to the chef to create something for me...I was so impressed! It wasn't your usual carrots, cauliflower and broccoli-The vegetables he chose were fresh- beets, sweet potatoes, mushrooms, onions, broccolini, brussel sprout leaves, and I think sliced beans- it was perfect!! Kudos to an amazing staff for providing top notch food!! I will definitely return",

No complaints at all for the food.  Service was exceptional, but $150 for three cocktails, one dinner salad, one appetizer and two entrees seems overpriced.

The food and layout resemble more of a tired chain than an interesting establishment sporting this name. There are few great options in this area (IMO), so not a bad choice if needing a quick bite or drink and you are close. If have a bit more time, opt to go toward the Roosevelt area and settle into a proper cocktail and meal.",

I prefer my scallops with more of a high heat sear on the outside but a little rare on the inside. My boyfriend had the prime rib French dip sandwich served with fries for $19. The fries were hand cut but not very crispy; neither shoestring fries nor thick steakhouse fries. It was definitely worth trying but it won't be part of my regular rotation.  I might come back for Happy Hour, 3pm - 6pm weekdays.",

I can't tell if it's gotten such great reviews because the AZ culinary scene has just started to become a thing and this was prob one of the first- or if it's just bc it's in a tourist section of town and has cool vibes. Either way, food is pretty mediocre to terrible. Chef's board is good, considering 90% of it is food other than meat and cheese. As for entrees, stick with a burger or meat- anything else will leave you severely underwhelmed.",

As far as \"stuffed\" crab, it was a piece of crab patty laid between the two smashed pieces of chicken. How does that qualify as crab stuff chicken? Also lacked flavor.

    "text": "I'll be honest, Phoenix is the first city I've been to where yelp steered me wrong on almost all occasions. Arrogant Butcher fits that. We arrived on a Friday night, it was busy, understandably, so instead of waiting 45 minutes we sat at the bar.  Luckily there were menus at the seats because the bartender couldn't be bothered. He was obviously out of his element. We waited a good 8-10 minutes before he even \"greeted\" us. The greeting was, what do you want. Literally. That is what he said. This dude had no business being behind the bar, he was a dick, flat out. Other customers got the same treatment. Maybe he was a fill in for someone who called out, but there should have been 2 bartenders doing service drinks and taking care of the bar guests. I asked for an IPA his response \"which one\", aggressively, like I was an inconvenience to him and his poor bartending skills.  We ordered food, my colleague ordered a salad and I the burger. The burger was meh at best. The patty had zero flavor and really all I tasted was whatever mustard style sauce they had on it. The fries were good, I'll say that. Of course our jolly bartender never checked in only when both our drinks were empty and food done.  Maybe table service is better, maybe the entrees are better, but I'd skip this place in a heartbeat.",

So much so that they should just remove the salt from the tables. Thought the first time with the oversalting of everything was a fluke. Went back a few additional times, tried the same items, and it wasn't a fluke.     Here's the list of menu items we've tried -  House Soft Pretzels and Fondue  Short Rib Stew Filet Mignon Fish and Chips Pastrami Sandwich Salted Caramel Pudding - yes, salted, but still over the top with the salt.   I seriously want to love the food here, but the bloat due to salt that follows after eating here is horrible.",

Upon walking in a group of ladies all at once asked us if we would likevtoo be seated, feeling overwhelmed I said Yes.... she walked us to our table.   I was starving and I already knew what I wanted.  Our waitress was tall as a stripper pole a killer smile with Ruby red lipstick.....  She rattled of some drinks specials in honor of Prince which I thought was a great idea.   I ordered the sea bass. Delicious!!!! It  was moist and flaky with a bed of amazing creaminess covering the bottom. I had no clue what is was but boy did it taste good.   My girlfriends had the jambalaya. It was the biggest bowl I had ever seen and it taste like you were transported to New Orleans. BEADS PLEASE.....  It had big chucks of shrimp, chiicken and sausage. I could'nt help sticking my fork in their bowls to get more. It was so good with the hint of heat at the end of each bite.  Yessss! Am I on Bourbon Street...  We decided to get extra greedy and order the hot chocolate cake with whipped cream.... have I lost my mind? MAYBE...but I was worth it.   Better get there early on Saturdays around 4pm for dinner. This place gets crowded pretty fast.   When Im in the downtown phoenix area I will make it my business to have round two at this special place.",

Showed up at 12:03 and they would 't seat us at first although there were numerous tables open. The explanation was complicated.  Once seated, the grilled fish tacos were calling my name although I came for a salad.  I made the right choice although my friend who had the salmon kale salad said it was really good. These were the best fish tacos I've had in a long time. The two tacos were of a good portion and double tortilla wrapped, like in Mexico. The fish was meaty and hot. The cabbage slaw refreshing and not overpowering. It came with two limes to squeeze. Plus had a minimal sauce inside. The white beans on the side were excellent. I would come back here again and get this same dish!!  Service was efficient and friendly.",

Now to the highlights - the service from Meagan was outstanding. Her recommendations were spot on! One of the best servers I have had in years! We had the burger, ribs and steak salad. To top it off, we had the warm chocolate cake. All the food was delicious and top notch.  Lastly, we gave some positive feedback to Elias, the manager and he was great. We discussed other FOX restaurants around town.  I have to say I am very impressed with the FOX organization and Meaghan and Elias must be valuable members of their team!",

Previously when they had happened upon this place , upon entering, they were told that Tilted Kilt was upstairs almost like they didn't belong there. That definitely gave me incentive to go just to see what would happen.  So that most definitely put a bad taste in my mouth initially.  The space is very nice... The food average. It was basically  overpriced & I just have issues with making up descriptions of food..When I asked the waiter to explain some of the menu items it was awkward. When I read a menu I want a straightforward description of what I'm getting.  for the amount of money we spent there was extremely disappointing. However the service was great. I like the open kitchen I always like that in restaurants. Watching the guy cleaning the ceiling while food was being prepared was an interesting event. Wondered about that. Other than a drink before an event or an appetizer probably won't ever go back.",

Let me say that the restaurant is very trendy looking, what I like to call classic Dallas.  I like the style of most of your places they are all inviting.   What I liked, it was a Thursday at 7:15 and with no reservations we had a table in minutes.  We were at an event with apps before hand, so we passed go and went straight for dinner.  Turkey sloppy joe is so good it should be in an Adam Sandler song! Love that roasted pepper on it.  Second, thank you for letting me substitute my cheese on the burger for cowboy creamery (which is indescribable).    Why your better than most, home-made chips and potato bread buns.  I also enjoyed the La Jota wine by the glass, was tasty with the burger.    Why I can't yet give you a five, servers need a bit more polish when the hubby doesn't eat cheese b/c he doesn't like it we are specific when ordering NO cheese.  If you don't write it down, you better get it right or should I say write. Hostesses need uniforms, they are cute and young but thier tiny skirts were making even them pull and tug at their own clothes.   Coleslaw is a little sweet, and I need to make another visit to check price point and some other items on the menu.    Overall, very excited about another visit and I love this location.",

The patio's great but it's starting to get warm (imagine that) so me & my friend grabbed a seat inside near the bar. Love the exposed ceilings & overall feel of the lounge area.   Had the Raspberry Mojito (not the best I've had but still pretty good) to start off with....switched to the Sun Up beer...awesome suggestion from our server.   The apple & beet salad was yummy! A great sized portion & really flavorful.   Service was great...our waiter was really friendly & super attentive.   Can't wait to get back for happy hour!",

We were stuffed next to another couple in basically a doorway-so close you would think we were all together. That turned out to be ok as we chatted it up with them while waiting for service. I watched a waited scurry around and roll his eyes multiple times, and of course he turned out to be our waiter. He seemed very uninterested and didn't seem enthusiastic about...well anything really. The couple next to us said he was quite rude to them as well. We ordered a couple old fashions, which were delicious, but because the vibe was so unfriendly we decided to just get a charcuterie board and leave. The board took quite a while, but it was tasty. We got our check and went across the street for our dinner. We usually do eat at pricey places for date night, but the pretentious service just made it not worth it.",

Dinner was sweet potato tortelli and the turkey sloppy joe.  A glass of chardonnay and a glass of syrah paired nicely with the respective dishes.  Then we finished it all with blueberry cheesecake.  Overall dinner was FANTASTIC.  And the service?  TOP NOTCH!  I think dinner could have been a flop and we still would have left with a good impression of the restaurant due solely to the level of service we received.",

I came here with coworkers and they were able to accommodate my reservation with relatively short notice, so that's a plus.  I would say that the drinks are better than the food, but that's just based on what I've had to eat there.  If you like modern cuisine, this place is for you!  First of all, the restaurant at dusk/dinner is very dim, so break out those reading glasses. Their wine list is amazing!  I would recommend the antipasti plate for an appetizer because it's the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. Be sure to get the awesome garlic and mushrooms with the antipasti plate. The house salad was one of the best I've had in a while, especially with the dressing on the side.  The squash tortelli was a little heavy on the squash.  I thought it could have been better balanced with smaller tortellini pasta and a hit of acid in the sauce.  It was overall a very heavy dish.    I think this is a great spot for a happy hour!",

Maybe it was a bad night. But I only give a lower rating bc the last time I was here I thought similar things but thought it was an off night. I'm tired of paying higher prices for average food. My son also has a food allergy (fish) and they said they'd changed the oil to fry his chicken strips and fries, but it came out smelling and tasting like their fish and chips (and it wasn't just bc it was the same batter).

That was the best hummus I've ever had and I'm a big fan of trying it from everywhere.  I had the fish tacos and my husband had the crab-stuffed chicken.  We loved our food and cocktails.    All in all, a great dinner out!  Thanks to Tony and the crew.",

Definitely worth trying.  Since it was my birthday and my friends know I am such a foodie, I got a sampling of a few things that were ordered :)  I love my friends!  Fried Chicken - double coated and fried, very crunchy, excellently cooked tender flavorful chicken. It's a special of Thursdays. It was great! Pastrami Sandwich - great meat with cole slaw and excellent bread (pretezel, a chicago favorite!) Jambalaya - Very yummy, perfect consistency and great tasting.  Comes with Shrimp, chicken, sausage and okra, each piece cooked to the perfect consistency Cheese Burger - Perfectly cooked burger, great flavor, excellent bun made of angus beef, and cheddar and with grilled onoins  Salted Caramel Pudding - a nice sweet and salty treat to top it off, a bit overly on the salty side, it kinda burned my throat, but still very good.   Tid Bit: Free desert on your birthday Tid Bit 2: THey validate in the lot under them for 2 hours, after that it's 3 dollars for the first hour.",

I have never had bad service at any of their restaurants and yesterday was no exception at my first AB visit. Kelly and team were wonderful and made us feel super spoiled.   The food was great. I had the pretzel bun Turkey Pastrami sandwich, which was Delish. The shrimp and pretzel apps are wonderful but the Carmel pudding was, \"lick the glass jar clean, to die for.\"   AB is a pretty restaurant, unique decor.    The only draw back is the price. I always find it so pricey/ costly to eat at a Fox place. However, they do have Happy Hour. Will have to go back for some more of those yummy pretzels.",

We were there for pretty much the entire happy hour, although a limited selection, the prices were good. For a total of 8 people a several drinks and appetizers to keep us satisfied, the check was just over $120. The pretzels are AMAZING (served hot but cold is still delicious, especially after a few drinks). The nachos are also good, just a little messy.

We started out with the Brussels sprouts Caesar salad. The dressing was amazing but I wouldn't really call this a Brussels sprouts Caesar because there were barely any Brussels sprouts in the salad. My wife got a half dozen of the blue point oysters and she really enjoyed those. It was a Sunday night and there special was their Chicken Pot Pie which was very tasty. It is extremely rich though, my wife and I were sharing it and we still couldn't finish it. It had great flavor with all the veggies and nice pieces of chicken. My only complaint is that I wish the base of the soup was a little looser because it was super thick and almost gelatiness at times. Overall a cool restaurant but it is on the pricey side. Probably wouldn't go out of my way to come here since it's in a busy area of downtown but if I'm down there for a sporting event then I will definitely stop by.",

I was extremely impressed with them both. Even the lady who sat us,  Sarah, was very kind and helpful.  The food is on a level of its own. As a party of five we shared the Butchers Choice platter n it was delicious. Id recommend ordering two for a party of six or more.

    "text": "This place is ok, nothing special.  I have been here 4 times, 3 times for lunch and recently for dinner.  I know this place is always busy and can get pretty crowded, but I'm baffled on why.  The location is awesome, its literally across the street from the US Airways arena, and there's alot going on in this block.  The ambiance is really nice, and they have some really cool photo's around the place, but as you know what I say, It's all about the food.  The prices are pretty high and the food and portions are nothing to brag about.  We arrived on a Saturday night, it was 10 of us.  We made a reservation at 6:00 and we're seated right away.  The service was pretty poor, but since we had a big group, figured there would be more than one waiter for our table.  We ordered some appetizers which we split and my lady ordered the Chicken stuffed with crab with a side of potatoes.  I ordered the Fish and Chips.  I hear some really positive reviews about their pretzels and fondue, but I thought it was gross.  We were all talking and chatting, and by the time we dived in the fondue, it developed a thick layer on top, which you commonly see from processed cheese like Velveeta, and when I dipped the pretzel it pulled the thick layer with it. That's why its under a fire, cause soon when it gets room temperature, it hardened up.  Not impressed at all, but if you like Velveeta, you might like their fondue.  The meat and cheese board was a joke, and the hummus was bland.  The main course arrived.  Since I had a horrible experience with my last fish and Chips (The Codfather) I felt I needed something to redeem my last experience.  The fish and chips were pretty good.  I requested some tartar sauce, not this ranch cr*p they gave me and malt vinegar, but it never arrived.  So I just ate it plain. My lady ordered the Chicken stuff with crab dish.  Like I read in a previous post, I have no clue what it was stuffed with, cause it sure wasn't crab.  It was like minced crab if anything else.  Really disappointing dish, especially for that price.  Food=C.  Very mediocre.  Portions are small and very little creativity.  Appetizers were terrible and quality of the ingredients are poor.  I have no clue what that chicken was stuffed with.  If I had to bet, it was minced crab out of a can.  Terrible.  Service=D.  I'll give him the benefit of the doubt.  We had 10 people in our group and he tried to accommodate everybody, but clearly couldn't handle the group.  I had to request my drink to be refilled several times and it took a while to get it filled.  I asked for lemons for my lady, it never arrived.  I asked for Tartar sauce and Malt Vinegar, that never arrived either.  Not impressed with The Arrogant Butcher.  I've been to several FOX concepts restaurants but this one is probably the worst.  Culinary Dropout is a close second.   I do like North a lot though.  Maybe I'll just stick to that one.  I do not recommend this place at all.",

What a great name for a restaurant located in downtown Phoenix directly across from the Arizona Diamondbacks ball park. With a solid 4 stars and over 1200 reviews it had to be outstanding right? Unfortunately the arrogance overcame the actual experience that we received. Arriving during happy hour the restaurant was extremely dead, but spring break, vacations etc, I'm sure it's normal in Phoenix. The service was just ok, the server seemed to take forever for our drinks, food and even the check. The drinks were watered down and not mixed right, one tasted like vodka and my second was more tonic/cloudy. The food was also just ok, the oysters were terrible, burger average and the best dish by far was the pork nachos. I'm sure this place is outstanding and it was an off day. I'd give it a try again maybe for dinner then next time I'm in the area.",

It is nice coming to place where your menu questions are answered without an eye roll and with confidence.  We started with the Pretzel Bun and Fried Shrimp with Jalapeno appetizers. These were amazing. The breading on the fried stuff was seasoned nicely and the Pretzel Buns coupled by the cheese sauce were simply irresistible.  I ordered the Cubano sammich and of course it was delicious. The amount of smokiness in the pork was a punch to the mouth but in a good way.

We split it 3 ways, and still couldn't finish.  For entrees, the table ordered:  Sweet potato tortelli: perfect dish. Tender little pastas pillows filled with sweet potato, and served with mushrooms, spinach and hazelnuts. The sauce was both creamy and buttery. I can't come here and NOT order this dish. Short rib beef stew: my husband's pick was served in a charming little pot. He said the stew had a little heat to it, and thought the egg served on top was a nice touch, as was the corn bread muffin that accompanied his dish. Meatloaf: our friend ordered this dish and seemed pleased. He wasn't able to finish his meal. It was a generous portion.  The bill for 3 entrees, an appetizer, 2 beers and 1 mixed drink came to just over $90.   We enjoyed the atmosphere, and the service was excellent. We will return.",

The atmosphere at Arrogant Butcher is  trendy and has a relaxing vibe.  As we arrived we were greeted by a very friendly hostess who made us feel genuinely welcome. Then a few minutes later our server, added to that feeling. All our questions were answered about the menu, and our server made suggestions based on our perferences.  We started our dining expeirence with appetizers, which were delicious.  I highly recommend the freshly made pretzel balls served with provolone cheese fondue. The pretzels are so fresh and fluffy, our server told us the pretzels are made on site every day. On this visit we also sampled the roasted peppers toast, smoked salmon toast, and the prosciutto deviled eggs.  All which I would order again.    For dinner I had the sea bass with creamy barley.  My entree  was absolutely delicious.  My dinner companions had the crab stuffed chicken which he said was the best he ever had. The portions were the perfect size and cooked to perfection.   As good as the entrees were, they were matched by the dessert selections.  We split the salted caramel pudding (my favorite), the peanut butter cup, and the pumpkin cheesecake, you couldn't go wrong with any of those. The desert were fantastic.  The service was perfect and our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.  We will definitely come back again.",

Cocktail sauce is the gold standard guys, don't get creative.   Had the beef stew which was very average, and my friend had the crab stuffed chicken which was dry and boring. Even the drinks were boring. After school special is a nasty ass drink, it's like a nasty version of a michelada, I didn't think it was possible to make modelo taste bad, but this place found a way to do it. Worse of all, they saw that I only took one sip out of the drink, and didn't offer to take it back or exchange for something that didn't taste like garbage... Seriously 90 dollar bill for a place that has slightly above average buffet quality food.... No thanks",

I spent good money on appetizers and she removed them from the table before our food came out and without asking - this is not only rude, but a waste of $$/food.

Used OpenTable and was able to secure a late dinner for 9pm Saturday night- the hostess and waitress were nice and we were seated with drinks fairly quickly. The menu looked good and I ordered the smoked salmon toast, crab-stuffed chicken and we ordered one of each of the desserts which were blueberry cheesecake and a salted caramel mousse thing.   Waited about 20 mins for the app, but it was fairly busy so no issue there- the salmon toast was not overly smoked, very tasty and the only part of the meal I liked. When the entree came I was kinda taken aback by what was an actual menu item- they serve two crusted and fried chicken breasts with a cold crab cake in the middle. There was a thick lemon caper sauce on the top breaded chicken breast but not enough to overcome the dry fried mess of a plate. The chicken was pounded thin and the breading was easily double the amount of chicken. The crab was decently seasoned but overpowered. I barely ate any of it.   Desserts were both overly sweet and unbalanced. So disappointed. I'm glad we didn't pay menu prices for this because I can't imagine going back.",

Since we were attending a concert and did not want leftovers, Jake had no problems with us splitting a fish and chips platter and our entree arrived with a second plate.  The fish was delicious, with a nice crunchy coating, and tasty white fish inside.  It was so good we wanted to order a couple of more pieces which Jake handled with no fuss at all.  Desert was also shared with another second plate.  Our valley travels don't normally take us to downtown Phoenix, but they may now knowing the Arrogant Butcher is there and conveniently located near the major entertainment venues.

    "text": "Besides the weak cocktails, i mean weak...I'm going to start by saying four-star reviews for this restaurant are a stretch. Would like to get a 3 1/2 stars. Made a reservation for 730 on a Friday night understandable with a basketball game and first Friday going on. Neither of which was very crowded at all.  Service was good. Appetizer came out, crispy buffalo chicken thighs. Delicious. But it looks like a plate that would come out of a Chili's and not a four-star restaurant. Crab stuffed chicken was tasty but chicken was slightly dry. I ordered the broccoli side which came out With the texture of baby food. If you like your broccoli mushy you'd be fine. But it didn't have any of the seasoning that were described, lemon aoli and sea salt.  I asked For a replacement dish and the next batch came out perfect, night and day difference.  Why couldn't you get it right the first time? Is what was going through my head.  Charcuterie plate $25.  More nuts than cheese; Maybe two pieces of cheese cubes, a few slices of salami? Several jams and things in a little stainless steel cups that were never described (could've been a good opportunity for a better review if the waitress explained this.) a few pieces of salami and prosciutto four pieces of bread. Hardly worth it at all.    Another person at our table ordered the burger $14 quarter pounder with cheese but mostly bun.   The scallop dish was the most expensive. It was interesting. Five scallops well cooked. The person ordered it really didn't care for sweet potatoes with it. She only ate the scallops. But they were good.  Finally my son ordered the French dip style steak sandwich. $19. That was very good.  All in all a very mediocre experience. For $200.",

We walked in and Hannah the hostess with the fing mostest greeted us. Hey girl...heyyy. She gets my vote for best hostess EVA! She was so welcoming, has a great attitude and she was joyful. Yes joyful! I even got up from my table to go back and chat with her for a few mins. Keep sparkling and doing the damn thang girl! Yasssss.  We also had an amazing waitress but I don't know how to spell her name tho(sad face). She checked on us just enough and made sure we actually were enjoying our food.   Ok on to the food. My kiddo and I split the shrimp appetizer which was delicious, chopped salad(champagne dressing) was so good along with the fish and fries. The fish was light and not heavy but needed the vinegar or whatever you fancy and the fries were delicious... lol. We really enjoyed our food. Rest of the group had burger, grilled cheese, prime rib sandwich and the mac n cheese. They all raved how good the food was. When you are out numbered by hungry teens taller then you make sure you feed them good food folks!  Alec one of the mgrs stopped by also, he to was warm and genuinely welcoming.  Great customer service. I was feeling the A to the B y'all vibe was on point, decor modern and a lil boujee boo boo just like I like it..heyyyy now. I will definitely be making a return visit to hit them up for dinner to see how they vibe.  Thanks Yelp Fam!",

    "text": "Order the Filet.  Quick!  Get there and devour one today.  Make a reservation before you go.  Here's what I know you'll like if you're a steak lover....just the right char on the outside (slightly smoky, a touch crisp), divinely seasoned, internal medium rare perfection, excellent grill lines and a whole lot of self-congratulations for picking something that literally changed my mood.  The potato on the side was tasty and sized right; the crispy veg added a hint of sweet.  What else did we try?  Well, the pics aren't great due to dim lighting and my family yelling that they were starving and to stop taking pictures---lol--but - we also got a ton of appetizers.  The pretzel fondue was salty, filling and warm cheese makes for a good day.  The Crispy shrimp won the day with a light batter and dipping sauce.  And, we should have ordered more Prosciutto Deviled Eggs.  We didn't try the Buffalo Chicken Thighs, but our neighbors did and loved them - seemed easy to eat with a fork.  Raw Oysters were very fresh, came with traditional accompaniments.  Make a reservation.  For dinner, it was the amazing Filet, salmon, sort rib stew, and Mac-n-Cheese.  With the two salmon dinners, one had modified sides.  Both orders were good and they seemed to really like the flavor, but both family members were still hungry afterwards.    Dessert: the Hot Chocolate Cake was teeny but cute and still shareable.  The Peanut Butter Cup: super rich.  I like peanut butter but had not anticipated a cup of heated peanut butter with a scoop of chocolate ice cream in the middle.  Cool concept, we didn't each much, though.    Important point I might have mentioned once or twice :) - make a reservation before you go - the wait time can be 2 hours if you don't.  If that's ok with you or even if it's not, then belly up to the bar and enjoy their wide selection of liquor choices.  The Polish Fix turned out great both times it arrived at my table.  Enjoy!",

It is a bit on the pricey side, but there are several good options for less. I'm here for a week long conference, so I have to be somewhat economical with my meal selections. The only reason I didn't give 5 stars was due to the time it took to receive our meals. It was 2pm, with 30-40% of tables empty, and it took 20-25 minutes. If this is the typical speed of service, they should offer some bread or something. Otherwise, the food was very good! I may even stop by again to try something else!",

Without a reservation, we were able to walk in and be seated immediately outside. We were quickly approached by our server, Jeremy who explained to us that \"Good News\" it was happy hour but \"Bad News\" The dinner menu wouldn't be ready for another hour +. Not sure why but we didn't ask for an explanation. My fiance has hungry so we got the pretzel bites for an appetizer from the happy hour menu. I got a smoked salmon salad and my fiance got the chicken bites for his meal (also off of the happy hour menu). Everything tasted decent, but ultimately we were bummed because we wanted dinner entrees. The smoked salmon on the salad was a bad choice. Although the salmon was fresh, it was far too smoky for me. It overpowered everything else in the salad and left me with an odd aftertaste. Our service was good and the prices were fair but I don't think there will be a reunion episode.",

    "text": "Wow: I was seriously impressed with my lunch here (and seriously overate as a result, but no regrets!) The menu has great variety but isn't overwhelming with lots of options for both indulgent or lighter fare. My crew and I split some carnitas nachos to start and got the Chef's selection for a charcuterie board-- both were outstanding. The pork on the nachos was just beyond: a great smoky flavor and super tender and the guac was terrific. Cheese was of the standard whiz texture but I'm certain it couldn't have been from a can. I could have eaten those nachos for days. The board was a great selection, with a couple cured meats (salami, prosciutto), cheeses (hard cheddar and something soft and mild) grilled bread, cornbread, some type of salmon salad, assorted nuts (marcona almonds yum) and spreads (a compote of sorts to go with the soft cheese and a house-made mustard spread that I'm crazy about) and two deviled eggs. I'm astonished that a restaurant in a landlocked state would have salmon this good: the salad reminded me of something I got at Russ and Daughters in NYC last fall which I assure you is the highest of praise. So flavorful and a lovely flaky and moist texture. Everything on the platter was of terrific quality. Of course I had almost no room for my green goddess Caesar, but what I could eat was also delicious - not overdressed but just the right balance, and a lovely blend of different greens. Lastly, I also got to try the short rib stew: WOW. So decadent. Highly recommend if you're in need of something savory and comforting that's umami blasted. There's even a yolky egg on top, and a huge chunk of cornbread that was one of the best I've tasted in a long time, moist and crumbly. Sad that I didn't have room for dessert (and that I don't live closer) but happy I got to try a few things! Don't miss out on this place!",

My husband and I were in town for the holidays and this was one of few places open on Christmas Eve, but we didn't hesitate to grab a table with such good reviews.  We grabbed a few bites and drinks off the happy hour menu - buffalo chicken thighs, nachos, the pink drink etc. all were slightly above average but not much more than creative bar food. The nachos were under seasoned and drowning in cheese sauce. The meat (a pulled pork) seemed like it would have been great but hard to tell while drowned in sauce. The chicken was overly breaded and sauced. The drinks were average at best.  I might consider going back if stuck in a pinch again - maybe we messed up by not ordering their signature meat and cheese boards - but I was really underwhelmed.  Not worth even the happy hour prices =(",

We started with the highly recommended pretzel fondue and it was fabulous.  My husband had steak and scallops and he raved about his meal, especially the horseradish sauce.  I had a filet and crab and it was incredible, so tender and perfectly cooked.  It came with the most amazing creamed spinach.  We finished our meal with the salted carmel pudding and I can honestly say that I have never had better pudding - it was simply delicious.  They do have a nice outside patio area but in August it was still too hot to enjoy the outside seating.  I will definitely come back, the Arrogant Butcher was fantastic.",

We got the pretzel bites with provolone fondue (just okay, I could make better fondue at home) my husband got the stew (he said it was eh just okay) and I got the chicken stroganoff (had no flavor).

I highly recommend sitting at the kitchen bar if you get a chance. Brian & Brian (unless they were kidding us) were great to watch at the apps/salad station. The charcutterie (salumi, pate, cheeses, antipasta) is the way to go!! We sampled salumi, pate, olives, elephant garlic, and a brie like goat cheese. It was the highlight of the meal!  We also ordered the soft pretzles & cheese fondue, which was good. I prefered the mustard that was paired with the meats on my pretzle pieces. My husband had the prime rib special which he said was quite good, and I had the sweet potato tortillone. It was also very good.  Next time, and there will be a next time, we plan to skip the entrees in favor of more from the antipasta options & hit up the salted caramel pudding dessert!  The only reason I cannot give my visit 5 stars is that one of the managers rudely and vulgarly reprimanded one of the chefs right in front of us. I had been having a great time until then. I didn't appreciate the cursing & I certainly didn't need to be a part of seeing a person belittled & demeaned with my dinner experience.",

Our server was nice and attentive however it took forever to get anything as the bar and kitchen were backed up. It was clear they weren't staffed appropriately to handle a full house even though they knew this concert was on the calendar MONTHS AGO! On top of that they don't provide you with their full menu on event nights and you are pretty much left with a majority of it being seafood choices which nearly all in our party don't eat. Not sure why you take simple things off the menu that everyone enjoys and can be prepared quickly and instead keep complex dishes that take longer to prepare when you know you are going to have a full house and timing and throughput are key. Drinks took about 15 minutes to get after ordering and food much longer. Suffice to say the majority of us just had drinks and picked up some greasy food at the arena which was more appealing than what this place had on their menu. It's a pity as I've been here before on non-event nights with a full menu and under those circumstances would give them 3.5 stars. Definitely a Jekyl & Hdye inconsistent offering and service type place, beware on event nights.",

The menu was limited, so I ended up having the \"Tabouleh\" Salad. Dude it WAS nothing close to a tabouleh! Who puts nuts, lettuce, feta cheese, and  quinoa in a tabouleh? Plus, it wasn't finely diced like a tabuleh should be.  My date had the Scallops  Bacon, Cranberry Beans, Spinach. He hated it! He isn't allergic to scallops, but last night his lip were swollen!   My date wanted to get a gift card from this place, but decided that our bad experience was a sign not to :(  Fox... please do something to fix this!",

Food was pretty average, although the pretzel fondue was really tasty. I got three shrimp which were pricey ($3/shrimp) but pretty large and the tabbouleh salad which wasn't like tabbouleh at all (but still tasty). Overall, good service, tasty food but overpriced.",

    "text": "This is a tricky one. AB is a really cool looking spot, really nice decor and ambiance, comfy booths, it even smells like a new car.  My group was greeted promptly by smiling hosts, and seated in a nice booth. Drink orders were placed, and when our margaritas arrived, they were really, really off and tasted terrible. Even after stirring, and thinking positive thoughts- they just were off- not sweet enough, and didn't taste good. Our server was cool and he swapped them out for other stuff. My replacement drink was a Polish Fizz, and it was perfect. Highly recommended.  For an app we went with the pretzel fondue, thanks to Yelpers who recommended it. As advertised, it was delicious, and I recommend it. For lunch I had the fish and chips, and my friend had some salad. The fish and chips were very tasty, but the price point, for the portion I got- just didn't compute. Three pieces of fish (think chicken tender size) and a small portion of fries, along with a small side of overly vinegared cole slaw. Again, the food was good, but you definitely don't get what you pay for. I understand the concept of smaller portions, euro style, etc. but for a bar food staple? I wasn't looking for a Costco serving of anything, but either bump up portion size, or drop the price from $16 to $11.50.  I really liked our server, but for some reason as things went on, he was more and more absent. To be fair, we had a really difficult person that joined us, some of the stuff this person said made me want to pull my hair out, so I feel his pain.  Anyway, AB is a very attractive spot that might be great for drinks and app. but for this price point, I would hit Durant's, Hillstone, or Beckett's Table. It's nice to leave a spot feeling that you got your monies worth, and that just doesn't happen here.",

    "text": "I think all the 5 star reviews are from people who work here, of which there must be 500.  Look at the trend all 5s then 2,3 and a few 4s.  I HATE that.  First off, it bills itself as a steak/chop house or American Grill- whatever that is.  It is not a Steakhouse, despite have butcher in the name.  Lets start with the ambiance:  Don't ever sit in the back room, it is so loud it is like trying to eat in a drum.  Also, what is up with the TV?  If I wanted to watch TV while I ate I would stay at home, or go to a sports bar.  Next the service:  It sucked.  There must have been 20 Servers, yet service was slow and inattentive.  I know the place is new, but they did not even have a wine list printed.  When we asked for the wine list, they first said they did not have one.  Sitting in the back room, I could see the freaking bottles.  Then, they sent us the manager, who was clueless.  She then the Bar manager.  Who looked like he used word to type up what he thought he had.  He was knowledgeable about wine at least.   Other than that the servers were slow and did not know the menu well.  Drinks:  My Dad ordered a Margarita, it was awful.  We complained to our server who sent over the Bar Manager.  The bar manager made him a second one, which was passable.  For that price it should have been great.  I ordered a draft IPA, they were out.  I got a 22 bottle it was good.  My mom got a 7 and 7, it was fine.     Now the Wine, WAY over priced.  An average markup is about double, it was triple or more here.  I.E. a $12 bottle at the store should be about $20-24 in a restaurant, it is $36+ here. No value  Food:  Meh at best.  The best part of the meal was the Cheese/meat plate.  Me and my Dad had the Ribeye.  The meat was drowned in a sweet sauce with mushrooms and cauliflower, I liked the Sauce, My dad did not.  But the sauce really over powered the steak. My mom had the Pork and Beans, she loved it.  All in all not the worst meal I ever had, but no value here.  Dessert:  I would not know, I am allergic to Peanuts and True nuts, not a single desert was nut free.  My Mom had the peanut butter cup - she loved it.  Also, they had no dessert wines, or any after dinner drinks.  Value:  $80 a person with food, wine, and drinks. I can think of many other places I could go and get a better meal for that price, or less! For example,  We had dinner at the Tuck shop the night before, the meal was great, and drinks and dinner was $80 Total!",

Ordered the tabbouleh salad, smoked salmon rillette, jambalaya, grilled swordfish, sweet potato tortelli, salted caramel sundae and blueberry cheesecake.  Everything was delicious.  Our whole table couldn't stop raving about each dish.  I don't know where all these 1 and 2 star ratings are coming from?  I had an amazing time and enjoyed every minute.",

We had to sit at the kitchen bar, which were probably the best seats in the house.  The salad chef was social, explaining the difference in meats and cheeses on the menu, while still running his station effortlessly. We even got a little taste taste of one of the items. We ended up ordering all sorts of things we probably would have never tried if not for him (salad chef).  Our actual waiter was very pleasant and knowledgeable about the menu.  So much in fact, I let him surprise me with my entree.  He chose a lovely sea bass, cooked perfectly. Absolute heaven. We we on a flavor high, so naturally we had to try dessert.  Salted caramel pudding with sliced apples, OMG. Somebody roll me out the door.... Just go there...with people who like to share.....",

    "text": "I loved everything about this restaurant! The food was delicious, great ambiance and friendly service. We came on a Friday night and the place was packed. I would recommend making reservations because we did have to wait awhile for a table. ( side note- there was no waiting on the patio but the patio is right in the middle of the foot traffic for the game at US Airways. While this is very downtown I feel like people are gawking at me while I eat. Or maybe I feel that way because I can't help myself from staring at other people to see what they are eating...)  We started out by ordering some drinks. I had the skinny raspberry mojito and my husband had the maid in mexico. Both drinks were really good. I loved my drink so much I vowed I would try to copy it and make it every day. Our service was very friendly and efficient and I felt like the staff knew the menu well. My husband ordered the grilled swordfish and I had the Friday night special the king crab cioppino.  The swordfish was cooked perfectly but the very best thing by far was the King crab cioppino. Our waiter said they almost always sell out of it on Fridays.  The broth was so delicious and it was loaded with scallops, king crab, mussels, some sort of pasta, and some other delicious seafood. It was a big enough portion that two people could easily split it. It comes with some bread so you could soak up the broth. If you come here on a Friday night I highly recommend you try the King crab cioppino.",

The food was great and although we only ordered appetizers we enjoyed them immensely and will be back for more and to try some of the dinner selections.   In short:  Drinks - A+ Apps - B+ Service - C-   the C- for service is due only to the fact some of the staff act as if they are above you and that they are going out of their way when seating you. It is this kind of BS that has always bothered me with some of the Fox concepts establishments, but they are tasty so i more than likely return.",

    "text": "Date of visit: 03/14/11  (I joined YELP just to write a review for this place!)  OMG... I love this place. The food was great. Just what you would expect from a FOX restaurant. Being downtown is a big plus.   The staff was helpful and Lauren was a great server. Ask for her when you go in.   The Kitchen staff was great. This was my second time at The Arrogant Butcher, so I decided to sit at the salad bar to watch the kitchen staff at work( Lauren was not in, but Chip was great too)...  Sitting at the bar you really get to see the workings of a kitchen. Watching the slicer for our charcuterie in action was really awesome, made by Chef Austin. Our food came out in a timely manner, and was perfect.   But what I really want to talk about is the desserts.   I ordered a Peanut Butter Cup, it was amazing. I watched as it was made by Chef Ricardo, he was really quick and knew what he was doing. So, I decided to try the other desserts. I noticed they had replaced the Apple Fritters with a Salted Caramel Pudding. I liked the apple fritters, but this new dessert is even better.  The caramel pudding is heaven in a glass jar( the idea is very inventive, I love it) Also the Blueberry cheesecake is really good as is the warm chocolate cake with caramel(my favorite mix), and they all come in the nifty cute jars.  Chef Ricardo was very helpful as I spoke to him about the desserts. He said when he is not here he is usually hiding in the back baking something. He stated it was a team effort and he loves his team in the pastry department and the rest of the kitchen.    I highly recommend The Arrogant Butcher,especially for desserts. And if you can, sit at the salad bar and watch them at work. Ricardo is hidden by the beautiful black slicer.",

Appetizer, the pretzel bites and cheese fondue was not good, pretzels were too salty and taste stale. Main course, had to send my dish back, my bun seemed to had been wet and then sat out to dry and my sloppy Joe was literally cold. At this point, I'm irritated after a long Diamondbacks game I was starving and I was just not satisfied. It took about 15 minutes to get my new plate of food by which time my husband was finishing up his seafood soup which he described as \"ok\" . I took a few bites of my sloppy Joe and wasn't impressed. Maybe we came on a bad day or perhaps too late but we were definitely not satisfied with the food. The customer service was excellent, just wish the food matched the service.",

I wasn't sure what to expect but judging by the name of the restaurant, I thought this would be mainly a steakhouse. I was totally wrong. I couldn't be more pleasantly surprised. This is the type of place that downtown Phoenix needs. It's contemporary American cuisine at its finest. The decor is modern and hip without being terribly ostentatious. The vibe reminded me of Chicago and NYC. It has a sophistication without pretension feel.  I had the Crab Cake Louie salad which I felt was exquisite. Everything tasted fresh without that fishy taste like crab cakes served in other places, nor was it overly breaded. The vegetables were crisp and the dressing was sweet, light, and spicy. I wanted to try more dishes but I practically licked my plate clean. My girlfriends were also enamored by this place and wanted to stay later but we all just agreed that we'll be back for Happy Hour and dinner. I would have given this place 5 stars but they aren't open on Sundays.",

Tasted like canned soup watered down. Brussel sprout Caesar salad contained chunks of bitter red cabbage and barely discernible traces of Brussel sprouts. I thought well at least there is dessert. How can warm peanut butter cup with chocolate gelato be bad? It can, trust me. It was a bowl of molten oversweetened peanut butter pudding with the tiniest portion of chocolate gelato known to man. Alongside we're 2 cookies that were surely pillsbury refrigerated dough with a lone chocolate chip in the center. Disgusting is not too strong a term.

The chips had a good flavor... just a little overdone. Service was good but the refill on ice tea was slow. No biggie, I wasn't dying of thirst.  I was torn and almost gave it 4 stars, but overall it was just A-OK. That said, I will return.  URG! Edit to up it to a 4 star review. I just couldn't leave it at a 3. It deserves a 4. For real.

We were seated  Food options seemed interesting but NOT for the price Atmosphere is great  If u want a quiet spot wait to go to this place when construction is done in downtown because they are building a Tilted Kilt pub upstairs and it was nosier then the people eating dinner    If u are a very wealthy person (your salary is more then 100,000 by yourself) u will be able to afford eating and drinking here",

But, I went back a few weeks ago and was seated immediately for lunch at 12:00pm (for 2).    I think lunch is a bit overpriced for what you get.  The fresh pumpkin soup (which changes daily) was absolutely delicious ($7)!!  But, I also got some oysters ($2.50 each, which is fairly normal).  Oysters were okay.  Disappointed that there were no crackers.  Very west coast.  Also, no horse radish!!   My friend got a prime rib french dip ($16).  He didn't seem to care for it, and I brought half home to my dog.  The french fries were nothing to rave about.    I might try them again for dinner, but overall I expected more after dropping a total of $50 for lunch.",

The staff was super friendly and good looking (seems to be a FOX thing). I liked their outfits: crisp, white button down shirts and a tie, jeans, and Converse.   The food was really good and came out in a timely manner. My friend got the special which was a pork sandwich w/fries and I got the fish sandwich w/a side salad. My sandwich was really tasty. The fish was flaky and the sauce it came with was delectable. The salad came pretty much dry so I had to ask for extra dressing, which I received promptly and tasted really good. My friend enjoyed her sandwich. I really liked her fries as well, which are made fresh there (think elevated In and Out fries). My strawberry lemonade was really yummy too, but unfortunately, didn't come with free refills.  I loved the interior, like I do most FOX restaurants. My favorite part was a room off to the side that had comfy looking tables with nice booths and a ton of pictures all over the walls.  I'd definitely go back here, especially for a business meeting or possibly a first date.",

Lettuce was crisp, flavors and textures blended perfectly, a big hit for sure. Shared the beef short rib stew and turkey pastrami sandwich, both were delicious. Finished the meal off with the warm peanut butter cup which was basically a peanut butter soup with peanut butter cookies on the side. Not my favorite but not bad either. We told our server Kelly that it was our first time to the restaurant and she treated us like royalty. Was very impressed by her thorough description of menu items and attentiveness.",

It was very heavy on lime juice an almost undrinkable.  I ordered the short rib stew for dinner and it was decent, not much short rib in it. Maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.

Was told there'd be a ten minute but we weren't kept more than 4 minutes at best. Plus the hostesses were very sweet. In fact, most of the wait staff was good looking. Speaking of good looking, the decor in this place is fantastic. It's a bit noisy and realy thrives off the hustle and bustle of the staff but I loved on attentive the waiters, managers and hostesses were to each table, some not even there own. Small booths have these fantastic burlap covered cone hanging light fixtures and there's a romantic sheer curatined off back room that's probably for intimate banquets. Holler.  We ordered the highly reccommended strawberry lemonades and to quote my waiter, I too, highly recommend the strawberry lemonade. My gal pal and I split the House Pretzels and Fondue and the Grilled Chicken T-somthing salad. Let me tell you, the pretzels changed my life. This wasn't a dinky, over-priced pretzel basket. It has huge pretzel squares that were too big to even fit half in your mouth. THey're so worth all the carbs. And I loved that the salt didn't come off when you picked them up.  The salad was fantastic too. They wre so nice to spilt the salad in 2 bowls for us and keep the dressing to the side. Feta cheese, almonds, grilled chicken, vingertee dressing. Yes, it was sex in a white bowl.  Would go back here and try their antipasta. Sam Fox is a culinary genius.",

Also sent the restaurant a note that we were celebrating my daughter's 11th birthday today to hopefully make her experience there special.   Well that wasn't the case today.  The waitress did not say 1 thing about her birthday and so when I noticed she didn't say anything I told her it was my daughter's birthday and all she did was just smile and nod her head. Thought that was weird. So I left it alone and we ordered apps (crispy shrimp and spinach artichoke dip) Both were ok.   Then I went on ahead and ordered the heirloom beet and kale salad with Salmon. Salmon came out and  the center was raw. After seeing that I lost my appetite. So I had the waitress take it back. At that point I was frustrated and we were ready to go. The manager came out and apologized for the Salmon and removed it from the bill.   We drove from North Phoenix to try this place and it was a waste and disappointing for my daughter because they didn't mention her Birthday at all.",

I ordered prime rib that has a mashed potato side. The mashed potatoes were soupy sand instant potatoes, tho the manager tried to tell us otherwise when we complained. Nothing comes with a side but if it does the side is horrible. Might as well have gone to Ruth Chris for the price. Booo",

    "text": "If I had to describe this place I'd say: it brings the memories of growing up in a white picket fence home collecting baseball cards and a touch of industrial design (exposed ducts, concrete walls, etc). If this isn't the vibe they're going for then I can't tell you what the vibe is. Either way I'm still struggling to figure out what their menu and aesthetic is supposed to invoke.   We arrived around 6:30pm on a Saturday evening. The wait was roughly 20-25minutes. We were seated and the waitress arrived right away. The booth seats and the diner bar remind you of a 50s mom and pop place. The back with the poster filled walls remind you of a pub type feel. The bar in the front give a modern look to the place.   The menu, despite its charcuterie apps and steak entrees, still has a homey feeling. I got the rainbow trout because I wanted something light. I wished I ignored my logic and got a burger or a steak (because that's what they're known for said the waitress) because as much as I wanted to like my entree it fell flat. My favorite part of the whole fish was the green beans, because it had flavor. I truly did want to like it because I was impressed with the ambience and decor but I can't lie. The trout had a delicious crunchy crust on it but no flavor.   We saw many reviews mention the salted caramel pudding so we gave it a go. It is very creamy and sweet/salty. I'd suggest a cocktail that is a bit more strong or a coffee to pair with this dessert.   All in all, this place caters to a demographic that isn't me. And that's not a bad thing but it's just not my thing. I'd say if this review peaked your interest then give it a go.",

The chicken was a deep fried, lightly battered, boneless breast which was complimented by a crab cake that was absolutely heavenly. I loved it so much, I actually cleaned my plate (which is very rare for me). The Service was nothing less than \"stellar\" simply put, this was a great restaurant with great food, great drinks and equally great service. If ever back it Phoenix, I will definitely come again, the rating found on Yelp is well deserving. Give it a try, I'm sure you won't regret it; Bon Appetite! Addendum: Now that my trip is complete, I can honestly say that if you are visiting and near the downtown area of Phoenix, put this spot at the top of your list, it is my top pick of all the Restaurants I've visited.",

Bacon wrapped sweet potatoes, cured meats, bread topped with olive oil, pistachios, cream cheese stuffed peppers, olives, corn bread madelines, deviled eggs, whipped salmon, tapenade something, truffle Brie, and a spicy sauce. So worth it!   Cheeseburger - skip. Ordered this one based on another yelp review and when it came out it was only a patty and bun with fries.

Then our lunch salads were wrong - they clearly weren't remade, just scraped the chicken onto another salad - the remnants of blue cheese that we asked to skip were a giveaway.   Dinner was no better.  Food was cold.  Received white wine instead of the red ordered not once, but twice. And service was slow and unapologetic.  Not much to be arrogant about here",

It's located in City Scape which is convenient and easy to find compared to other downtown locations. We were able to park in the garage which was a very short walk away. The only downside was that we forgot there was a game that night in downtown... well actually two games. So the parking prices were changed to $20 due to the events.  I got a reservation through their website on OpenTable and our table was ready the moment we arrived. There appeared to be about 3-4 groups waiting. The ambiance inside was super charming and I loved looking at how the place was designed. Such fun furniture pieces and lighting. They had several Tv's showing the games but they were not obnoxious or distracting. It blended in nicely.  Our server was personable. I got two oysters (I told you I had a little craving for them!) And a half pound of crab legs. I requested them to be steamed. I loved that you could order the oysters by the piece. I'm not sure if it's because I was craving them THAT bad or because they were THAT good but man oh man those were the best oysters I've ever had. I was in heaven. The crab came with cuts so you don't have to try to get the meat yourself. It was a win win for me.  The Arrogant Butcher will definitely be included on my rotation of restaurants. Look to reserve a table online, and keep in mind if it's a game day if you want to avoid paying overpriced parking!",

    "text": "Arrogant Butcher! I got into town pretty late in the evening. I was hungry and need to get something. So I reserved this place. When I got here around 8pm. It was not busy anymore. The place is pretty big, I can say it is huge. They have different part, it feels like the restaurant/bar are different in anywhere you sit! This is wonderful and the place looks cool. The kitchen closes at 10 pm and the bar closes at 11pm!  We got in and greeted with a warm smile by the hostess. We sat at our table and give water straight away. Our server came and asked whether we want to get other drinks? She is really nice and accommodating. Our party came separately and we stayed there for two hours++, she kindly enough order our food separately! The food comes out quite fast and pretty good, I took one star off because of the food! Their main course is simple i mean nothing special. However, their appetizer is amazingggg (their nachos and chicken finger tempura) outta this world! I would comeback there just to get the chicken finger tempura and beer! maybe on a football sunday or like some other sports events!",

    "text": "How ironic that their name sake seems to be their policy. We were trying to book a reservation for an evening, and were told that it was busy that evening because of a local event that was going on. I can understand that. But I do not understand was their indifference to helping someone get a reservation or letting them know if one opens up. I left several notes and messages to them on OpenTable about calling me if an reservation opened up or not, just to keep me informed. Yeah I get that there is limited space but they didn't seem compassionate at all. My sister says the food is good there, I would've liked to try to myself but couldn't get in. I'll update the review when I actually get a chance to try the place.",

The ribs were not only dry but tasted like they came out of a bag or pre-made and the scallops were rubbery and over cooked. The prices are insane considering that the food is subpar. I would never recommend the place to anyone. There are great steak houses around the valley better than this place. Texas roadhouse serves a better plate than the Arrogant Butcher. Avoid for good food.",

The place was busy my only complaint was we had a reservation at 5:30 showed up at 5:15. The hostess had us sit there to wait \"until it was the time of our reservation time\". Well then she forgot we were there waiting and called me on my cell phone at 5:40 asking if we were going to come in for our reservation.. had that not happened it would have been a perfect 5 star.",

    "text": "This was my first visit. We brought out of town guests here after a drive up South Mountain to view the sunset and city lights. Hubby had been here once before. GF ordered a Pink Drink and LOVED it. Her hub ordered a beer (choice of 16 or 20 oz) and we split a bottle of wine. We did not have reservations but were seated on the patio immediately (winter with heaters so very pleasant and quieter than inside). My hubs ordered a beet and kale salad with the shortvrib stew and corn bread. The salad was perfectly dressed and tasty but over priced for what you got. The stew had very little meat and was watery without much flavor. The other fellow ordered the ahi tuna whichbwas quite tasty. My GF and I ordered the scallops with Brussels sprouts and sweet potatoe. OMG-- instant orgasm!! This was the best dinner i have ever had! I have travelled to over 50 countries and eaten meals everywhere, but nothing compares to this dish! The scallops were perfectly cooked-- not over done and amazing flavor and seasoning. The sprouts were shaved and scrumptious! As were the sweet potatoes. I could have licked the plate, but i managed to refrain. The potions were just right. I want to go back next month for my birthday and order the scallops again!",

We had a reservation, but the Thursday night that we were there, tables were not hard to come across.  My party of four ladies decided on a charcuterie platter and some zucchini fritters to start and a few glasses of wine.  Our server was friendly and attentive.  She whipped those us for us right away.  Then we ordered.  My  3 companions all had salads, salmon, green, BBQ Chicken.  They all seemed to enjoy theirs.  I went rogue and ordered the special, fried chicken.  Whoa.  The portion was huge.  Totally shareable.  It also came served over a honey drenched biscuit and coleslaw.  I nibbled on all three, but was full much faster than I'd hoped.  The chicken was flavorful, but not as crunchy as I like it.  The biscuit was my favorite.  I enjoyed the charcuterie plate quite a bit and the wine selection was respectable, so I sampled a few glasses and was pleased with my choices.  Overall a solid spot with hearty food served in hearty portions.  Prices are fair, ambiance is fun and service is great!",

Now THOSE are soft pretzels. If you're looking for \"gourmet\" sandwiches, you can find that at Jimmy Johns. Their service will be faster, they won't be as expensive, and their sandwiches will actually taste good.

    "text": "First off, first impressions are important and The Arrogant Butcher failed to make a good first impression. We had a 5:00pm reservation but were greeted, actually not greeted at all, by two very young girls who seemed to know little about hostessing.   Once seated, the atmosphere was pretty cool and we were given water right away which was appreciated.  The menu had some good options and we decided to go with the zucchini fritters, short rib stew, and the sea bass.  Zucchini fritters: light, fluffy, a perfect sized appetizer for sharing but very underseasoned. The aioli, however, was very tasty.   Short rib stew and corn bread muffin: amazing! Live up to the hype! Well done! The meat melts in your mouth and there was just the right amount of spice. The cornbread muffin was fresh, sweet, crunchy on the outside, and soft on the inside. Yum!  Sea bass: This is the meal that I personally ended up with and it was terrible. I would've preferred a bowl of  just the barely because the fish was dry and flavorless. Horrible dish. The menu says it has artichokes but fails to mention that there are two paper thin slivers of artichokes! The barely was decent, under seasoned, but decent. I would never order this again. Worst sea bass I have ever eaten in my life. Might as well throw a fish stick on the top of this dish.   Service: It was just okay. The kid disappeared constantly and took quite a while to return but his colleagues picked up the slack. Service was very average.  We may return but we'd be more specific in the reservation and steer clear of that sea bass. Bleh!",

The filet is crusty and salty, and cooked to perfection. Our waiter, Colby, said on Friday and Saturday's the grill guy \"bobby\" works and is the best grill master ever.   We also had the butcher platter and that was the best cheese and meat selection ever. It only included 2 cheese and 2 meats, but it also had bacon wrapped sweet potatoes, cherry marmalade, mustard and deviled eggs, plus the thick cuts of crusty bread with a balsamic drizzle. Unreal. Seriously so amazing.   We live 300~ miles away and we will come back to Phoenix just to come back to this restaurant. Can not miss.",

Yum!  all of that being said, they appear to have amazing charcuterie, with many cheeses and meats available, but we didn't order it bc no one else at the table was interested.  Next time (if there is a next time) it will be charcuterie and dessrt for me!",

Many thanks to Brittany for going above and beyond, she apologized when our pretzel bites were a little cold and took care of it promptly.  Checked on us numerous times (something I myself as a former server value a lot).

We started with the Carnitas nachos with white beans which was a surprisingly tasty and filling appetizer.

We had never been here before, we had kids with us, and the menu isn't exactly tailored to a younger child's palate but, we found something that would be suitable for the kids and gave it a shot. Turned out to be the best mistake we ever made. The service was excellent, the food was delicious, the atmosphere was great, everything was absolutely perfect.

Definitely did not look like the pictures online, but more like a backyard BBQ mistake. Cole slaw was good.   We are Midwestern non-complainers so will not send back a meal unless bugs are crawling out. But I do believe it's important for the restaurant and consumers to know what's happening.

    "text": "Arrogant Butcher continues to disappoint.  I came here on Friday to celebrate someone's birthday.  The pretzel/fondue appetizer was awesome, as always, but I'm beginning to suspect that it's the only good thing on the menu -- and really, that's not very impressive because how could they possibly mess up salted bread and melted cheese??  We were headed to the art museum after dinner, so I decided to order an appetizer for my meal since I knew I couldn't finish a whole entree and I didn't want to lug leftovers around with me on the lightrail.  At first I ordered the steamed mussels, but sadly they were out of them for the night.  My second choice was the salmon rillette, which the menu described as \"smoked salmon with crusty bread.\"  I was expecting a lox and french bread type of plate, but what came out was smoked salmon that had been mushed up into little chunks, soaked in some sort of liquid (tasted like vinegar maybe?), poured in a jar and topped with many capers.  I gave it a try and spread it on the bread, but after 2 bites I knew I did not like it.  it was mushy and sour and yecchh.  I was waiting for the bartender (we sat at the bar) to come by and ask if we enjoyed our food so that I could exchange my salmon for a salad or something, but she never did.  she only came at the end of our meal and collected my plate (still FULL of food except for the 2 bites missing) and threw all the food in the trash.  you would think the plate full of uneaten food would've clued her in that I didn't enjoy my meal, but either she didn't notice or didn't care, but just brought out the check and gave it to us without comment.  I didn't want to be fussy, so we paid and left.  My dining companion ordered the jambalaya for his meal and said it was really greasy.  Arrogant Butcher, you make me angry that you charge so much money for bleh food.  I will not be convinced to come here again, no matter how good your pretzel/fondue is!",

    "text": "First time at Arrogant Butcher. I was there for lunch and impressed with the menu. I will have to come back and try their raw bar, cheeses, meats, and apps! I ordered the Turkey Pastrami with fries. It was soooo good! The meat was seasoned to perfection. The fries tasted and looked home made. They also put some sauce on the sandwich that was killer, yum!   Service: They have the right amount of people, now they just have to figure out the glitches. Nothing HUGE, just minor things I would have changed. (I use to be a server in college my days, so I have high expectations) One server though was odd, he kept saying weird things. I don't remember what the word was but he said it to everyone at my table. I didn't mind but my conservative co-worker was taken a back so it made me feel awkward.   Def. coming back!",

    "text": "We entertained clients there.  It's a great location and certainly a trendy night spot.  I give kudos to the hostesses for helping us pull together several tables and being patient while we waited for our colleagues to arrive after they got lost.  Sort of strange though how we would order drinks from our server and each time they would get delivered it would be a different server and we kept having to tell the drink delivery person who ordered what.    Personally the drinks are overpriced at $9 for Bombay Gin for example.   My co-workers who were drinking though the drinks were weak especially at the $9 mark.  Likewise it took three people to find me a glass of water without ice and lemon.  The food was just okay - but when you pay these prices and are in a trendy location I really expected more.  Two dishes out of 10 people were sent back and finally one was removed from the bill.  The sea salt chips were great as an appetizer but I thought my salmon was really overcooked.  Again, it wasn't bad, but I expected more.  I probably wouldn't go back, as when I travel I like to find really good places to eat and when the place doesn't give me a good vibe I just move on to discover something else.  I wish them the best, but it seemed like the customers were there more because it was the \"trendy place to go\" and not because the food was outstanding.    Again, I think the hostesses did the most, the original server was great - but in a party of 10 we shouldn't have to raise our hands to see who ordered what each time the drinks arrived.  I would expect than at a place for beer specials and not an average of $9 bucks a pop.",

    "text": "I went to dinner 3/19/2011 before the symphony.  We had a reservation and, when we arrive at 6pm, the place was already filling up, which I'm glad to see for a downtown location on a Saturday night.  We started with the pick-your-own meat and cheese tray.  With just a few selections, it can get pricey for an appetizer, but it was a reasonable portion of meat and cheese, and presented nicely with preserves and toasted bread.  I started with The Polish Fix cocktail, which basically tasted like lemonade with a kick and crushed raspberries.  Absolutely awesome, went down very easily.    The menu seemed all over the map - casual fare like fish and chips, a few items on a raw bar, sloppy joes, steaks, salmon, pork and beans?  I just could not discern any theme or direction for it all.  Also, we got conflicting information from the servers - the first one telling us the evening's special was short ribs, the second one clarifying it was baby back ribs (not the same thing, at all).    I had the skirt steak, which came on top of an amazing mix of fingerling potatoes and a thick cut bacon, and topped with fresh green beans.  Everything was cooked well, seasoned well, and tasted amazing.    We shared the peanut butter cup dessert, which was weird but worked - a peanut butter creamy base (very thin, not at all like a pudding or mousse, basically the texture of melted ice cream), with a scoop of chocolate gelato and peanut butter cookies on the side.    With a shared appetizer, two entress, one cocktail, 4-5 glasses of wine, and shared dessert, the tab was $180.  A little expensive for a pretty casual dinner, but I would probably go back.    Minor pet peeve - the server had been pretty good about checking in and then went MIA when it was time to get the bill, pay and leave.  This generally drives me nuts, but particularly in the evening downtown, when so many customers are trying to get to a game, concert, etc.  Just let us give you our money and go, ok?",

If it was horrible I would have rated it lower so obviously it's a decent place.  I have no issue with spending money for great food and service period.  Tonight wasn't happy but still tipped the server 60 bucks on a 280 tab.  I would say the bar tends to be underwhelming over all three visits.  There are simple drinks they just don't know how to make and literally have had to tell them how.  My friend and I asked for an old fashioned but light on the simple syrup because we want to taste the whiskey.  He did a pretty decent job but the waitress almost went out of her way to tell us that she didn't pass our request on because she knows that they would never do that.  Ok, interesting and weird. Prime rib, Waldorf salad, burger and sea bass were the entrees.  We tried the board beforehand.  The board was ok but very little meat for what they charge.  The sea bass was fishy smelling and all of us eat seafood often and noticed it.  The burger was supposed to have some additional items like ketchup, mustard and tomato but received none of the above.  Prime rib was tasty but was told by server that they don't have real horseradish, only the creamy version. Asked another guy for it and he brought the real stuff out.  She didn't deserve the solid tip but we're not assholes so we left it anyways.  Either way, the 4 of us have probably spent close to $1000 over the last couple months at this place and won't be going back any time soon.",

I honestly can't say enough about this place.. Started the evening with our waiter (Brent) He was very attentive to all our guest and had a smile the entire time!  He made sure everyone in our party had a drink in hand at all times, whether it was a cocktail/or ice tea. (excellent drinks by the way) We also ordered different appetizers, from the cheese platter to zucchini fritters & crispy shrimp. For dinner we all ordered something different. I had the grilled salmon, husband had the baby back ribs. Everyone's dinner came out quickly and nicely prepared. (the food was really really good) Our Waiter continuously checked on us to make sure everyone was doing ok. The level of service at this place is a 10+ There is NOT one bad thing I can say.. Our guest are still raving about this night. Grad dinner was a complete success! Thank you Brent, and The Arrogant Butcher!",

For entree ordered the short rib stew and this dish is by far my favorite. It has a nice heat to it without being too hot, the spices really compliment the whole dish and it has a thinner texture than most stews which makes it more enjoyable. The corn muffin was to die for, can you say butter butter butter? Overall the server was friendly and attentive. But what is with the sorority of hostesses up front who have attitude? Be nicer to your walk-ins and offer them a place to wait instead of dismissing them when you get the mobile number, it would make the first impression more enjoyable.",

    "text": "Waiting for Arrogant Butcher to open, my patience was low, apprehension was high, and excitement was through the roof. Finally, the day has come when it was mine to try. Fox Concepts are hit and miss with me, as some of the ones I love are super cheesy (Olive and Ivy, Modern Steak, Bloom), and some that I don't love are ones that are extremely popular (Sauce, Blanco, and Zinburger.)  What sets Arrogant Butcher apart from the rest is it is the first downtown Phoenix restaurant that Fox RC has put out there. I'm sure they are nervous, and you can tell that from the design of the restaurant... it's much smaller than normal like they are testing the waters, yet in other ways it excels in the money spent meter. Three beautiful private dining rooms, a chef's counter facing the exhibition kitchen which they spared no expense on, and a great four sided bar in the middle. The atmosphere is a definite throwback to the 40's and 50's, which is nice considering you can't find that in many places downtown. It's truly a feel of an old tavern and restaurant.   Arrogant Butcher went out of their way to support local. Almost all of the beers on the tap as well as on the bottle list are Arizona breweries, there are pictures all over the restaurant of historic Phoenix landmarks and famous people, and they have done a great job of engaging the street with the patio and entrance. Yup, Sam Fox, the guy who is building a national empire of restaurants, brought downtown Phoenix a place that gives a nice sense of community.  As for the food, all apprehensions were set aside when the bowl of mussels in wine sauce with spicy pork shoulder, roasted grape tomatoes, and french fries came to the table. The dish was outstanding and had me wishing I could drink the broth. My main course of the crab stuffed chicken, served cordon blue style, with myers lemon and capers was also a very well executed dish. It was served with sauteed spinach underneath which I ate ridiculously quick. Other items on the menu sounded great, and AB offers a list of meats and cheeses, as well as a daily special that rotates weekly, and a nice array of sandwiches and salads for lunch. The desserts are fantastic as well, especially the peanut butter cup dessert, which is not served the way you would think it is, and includes cookies for dipping.   So no, this restaurant is not a locally owned, mom and pop style place, but rather it is a restaurant with a formula that is crowd pleasing, set in a location that could really use something of it's type, with the power to draw people in by the numbers. My biggest impression? on the first dinner service night, there were absolutely no hiccups in service. Our waitress, bussers, and drink people were all absolutely spot on. Keep it coming, Arrogance.",

The tea that came was passion fruit not black tea and the waiter did not inform me of that. The salad was OK but the dressing was very spicy. Again no info on menu or from waiter. The noise level even at lunch was deafening. Recorded music like Coldplay very loud. I asked to be moved away from  speakers or to turn it down. No response. The wait staff was inattentive. Save your money. The arrogant butcher deserves it's unfortunate choice of names.",

Great atmosphere, loved the look of the place.   We didn't try any of the appetizers but our food was excellent. I had the grilled salmon, husband had the sea bass. Both very well worth it. Portions could've been a tad bigger, but we walked out feeling pleasantly (not overly) full.  I will say I was a tiny bit disappointed in the [lack of] menu options. I wasn't looking for pages and pages of options, but I was looking for a little bit more of a variety with a name like \"The Arrogant Butcher\".   For dessert we also had the warm peanut butter cup with chocolate gelato. My husband absolutely loved it, but it was a bit too much peanut butter for me.",

Some places make their jambalaya too wet and it becomes mush. But this place makes it perfectly moist.  The short rib green chili stew was the best! Super flavorful and spicy. It comes with a sweet cornbread which is the perfect compliment to the spicy savory of the stew.  Great for big groups, lots of room, good food, and friendly service.

    "text": "Came here not once but twice while in town for a few days.  Arrogant Butcher epitomizes what I like to see in a gastropub: good quality upscale comfort food, unique drinks, edgy vibe, and friendly service. It's not cheap, but their happy hour (only on weekdays) from 3-6pm is a pretty fabulous deal. I had their chicken parmesan burger (decadent breaded chicken covered with primavera sauce and cheese) with fries the first time, and their \"pretzels\" (more like pretzel bread) with cheese and caesar salad the second time, along with a strawberry and thyme drink. I was only slightly disappointed with the pretzels with cheese (a huge basket of essentially bread...and cheese dipping sauce is not worth $10), but everything else delivered.  This place is popular: even on a random weekday afternoon it is surprisingly full. But service was reasonably fast, and generally always delivered with a smile. Definitely worth coming back to!",

    "text": "Me, my husband, and my mother in law came here for dinner tonight. We had a great time and the atmosphere and service were fantastic, but the food in relation to the prices left something to be desired. I teetered between a 3 and a 4 star review, but ultimately decided on 3.  For drinks my husband had the Kiltlifter (on tap), I had the Hefeweizen (on tap), and my mother in law attempted to order Fireball, but apparently they don't carry it. The waitress said it was too obscure, so she ordered a Jim Beam and Coke instead. Overall, the drinks were good, but to be fair, they were easy orders.  For appetizers we got the deviled eggs (3 halves for a total of 1.5 eggs for $3) and pretzels with provolone fondue ($10). Both were absolutely delicious. The price on the eggs was a little steep, but they were very good. On the other hand, the pretzel appetizer was very large and was a surprisingly excellent value. I believe they have it in happy hour for like half price, too. The cheese was delicious and the pretzels were really good. I would definitely recommend.  For the entrees my husband got the prime rib special ($32), I had the New York strip ($36), and my mother in law had the crab stuffed chicken ($23). My husbands prime rib was thick cut and looked incredible, but he said it was a little dry. He said the au jus was really good, though. My mother in laws chicken was not stuffed. It was two fried (but not breaded) and pounded chicken breasts with the crab sandwiched in between. She said it was good, but just not at all what she thought it would be when she read \"stuffed\". My New York strip was really, really good. The meat was excellent, but the accompanying potatoes were really plain. Overall, I really enjoyed my meal, though.  For dessert we had the peanut butter cup, which was not a cup at all. It's warm peanut butter mousse with a tiny scoop of chocolate gelato in the middle. It came with two peanut butter cookies on the side. The mousse was excellent, but it needed more gelato to balance it out. We also had the blueberry cheesecake, which was really creamy but not very sweet at all. The sweetness was more in the blueberry compote on top, which I really loved, but it might not be for everyone.    I am not sure we will come back here. It's definitely possible, but we weren't really wowed by anything that would compel us to return. We would likely try one of the many other Phoenix restaurants before returning to see what they have to offer.",

I worked in the food service industry for quite some time, so I typically give bad service the benefit of the doubt. The service we received last night garners this review. We had a reservation and we were sat at a table in the bar area around 8:15pm. We sat there for 10 minutes or so before a server even came by with waters. When he finally greeted us, we placed an order for our drinks and an appetizer, which were great and arrived quickly. (ALWAYS get the fondue pretzels. Always!) We eventually ordered our meals - nothing spectacular to say about the crispy chicken breast or the caesar salad. (The steaks and prime rib have historically been fantastic, so maybe just bad selections on our part.) After we finished eating we waited for at least 15 (maybe 20... again, benefit of the doubt here) minutes to receive our check. We looked around.... we were the only table left in the bar area and our server was nowhere to be found. We were honestly stunned at how slow and inattentive our service was here, especially later in the evening on a Wednesday night!   Sadly, we won't be returning. I'll get my fondue fix at Culinary Dropout!",

The batter wasn't heavy so appreciate it. Fries were a bit salty but decent. The tartar sauce had a orange hue to it so sure it's some variation to the traditional recipe. Wasn't the greatest. Dare I say it but it tasted more like mayonnaise than tartar sauce. Would I go back here for the very expensive prices? No. If my fish and chips was 8-9 bucks then I'd give this place a 5 but I expect more when you charge me 20 bucks for fish and chips for mediocrity. I ate it all but not anything special. I've good versions of the stuff here in UK and Ireland...he'll even California.",

I ordered the soup of the day which was corn chowder....flavorful, but I prefer my chowder to have a thicker consistency.  My chowder was supposed to come out first, but my food ended up coming out first. I ordered crab stuffed chicken with mashed potatoes on the side. When my food arrived, I asked them where my soup was. They apologized and brought it out.  A few minutes later the manager came over and apologized and said dessert would be on them. I thought that was amazing customer service and I greatly appreciated the gesture. The crab stuffed chicken was good, not delicious and mashed potatoes were just ok.

I just really thought after reading the reviews first that this place was going to knock it out of the park.       After arriving, we were told that there was a large party in the back and that they were not seating people until the kitchen could get caught up. We were a party of two with no one else waiting. So ok, no problem we'll just grab some drinks at the bar and wait and she says she will come get us as soon as they start seating again.      Well, after 30 minutes in and watching not 1 and not 2 but 3 different groups come in and get seated in various locations we decide to go reestablish that we are indeed still waiting in case she thought we left and were told they could get us in 15 more minutes.       Fast forward now we are seated and have ordered. This place is so loud. I mean I get that it is what it is but my goodness, i felt like we were shouting during our entire meal and speaking of the meal. It was just so-so. One meal was the the filet mignon.....meh.. and the other was the diver scallops also meh...should have just stayed at the bar, speaking of which craft beer selection was very nice and staff very knowledgeable.",

I work in customer service, and have worked in customer service for about 20 years. Customer perception is reality. The girls at the hostess area/computer/thing just don't seem to have any desire to assist. My wife and I had a reservation tonight for 7:45. Our plans changed and we arrived early, around 6. We asked if we could be seated earlier, and they said no problem. Here it is, 7:05, and plenty of people have walked in and been seated after we came in. I walked up around 6:30, and they said it would be a \"couple\" minutes. As my wife and I sit here and see the empty clean tables, that have been empty and clean since we arrived, I myself am beginning to wonder if we slipped through the cracks or something. I must have forgot to take off my invisibility cloak or something. All 4 of these ladies are just standing there, talking and chatting, and help more people as they come in, and get seated. Needless to say, this is a pretty long review because I have lots of free time while I wait to be seated with my wife. At this point, looks like we are going to be seated at our original reservation time. Arrogant Butcher, you may have lost a loyal customer...... I started off this review with 4 stars, and have since dropped it to 2, as I'm sitting here, waiting to be seated..... UPDATE: Just moved it back to 4 stars, thanks to Alec (spelling) one of the managers, who personally came by our table because he saw this review on Yelp. I have to say, being a manager myself, it means a lot to face an upset customer, especially while they are still in the restaurant. Kudos to him, and the ownership for having him as a manager.  I did tell him that other than the initial aspect to our visit, everything else, from the wait staff, to the food, has been amazing. Thanks for helping us make our night of celebration easier.",

    "text": "Went to arragont butcher with the wife for mothers day.  Very nice place, open floor plan with kitchen right in open view. Ordered the meatloaf dinner. The meatloaf was very good. It came with what they called potato puree and string beans. Although the piece of meatloaf was very good and thick, there really wasnt much. The potato puree made a fork full and the string beans was two fork stabs. I did have the blueberry cheese cake for dessert, which i normally wouldnt have had if i wasnt still so hungry from the very tiny portions of food. The cheese cake comes in a little jar and even eating after dinner still leaves you hungry. All in all the food was tasty but for the money i wont eat there again because i like to leave a place feeling a bit full. Thank god i found a portillos on the drive home, we ordered dinner again and i found it much more satifying.",

    "text": "Quality: 5 Ambiance: 5  Price (Relative): 5  So the three things I base my rating off (scale of 1-5) and they are the quality of the food, the ambiance of the restaurant and the price relative to both of the first two. We went to dinner at the Arrogant Butcher and at first walking in the place seemed like a cool trendy retro diner.   We started off our meal with the Butcher's Platter - which is the Chef's daily favorite charcuterie board. It included (1) the Prairie Breeze & (2) Bellwether Farms cheeses; the (3) Fra'mani Salumi & (4) La Quercia Proscuitto Americano, as well as (5) Tosted Cibatta, garlic oil & balsamic, (6) jalapeno corn bread (7) Crispy Prosciutto Deviled Eggs, and (8) Marcona almonds. For $23 this was definitely a great way to try multiple items and from what our waiter said, they are known for their \"Charcuterie boards.\"   For my main dish I got the Crab Stuffed Chicken - I was a little surprised when the plate arrived and it was literally to pieces of chicken with crab in the middle. I will be honest, I expected it to literally be stuffed chicken, but I promise once I got past the second bite I didn't care if it was inside, on top of, underneath, or in between two pieces of chicken. It sat on a bead of spinach and the flavors were amazing. I definitely loved all of the flavors and would definitely order the same plate again.   Last I think the most important question I always ask myself and my company, is if I/they would ever go back. To warrant a yes to me it has to be all encompassing as well as have other items on the menu I can't wait to try. I don't often say yes, especially when I am traveling, but I will definitely go back to the Arrogant Butcher and would love to try man of their other entrees!",

My server suggested I try the ruben sandwich on a pretzel bun.  I was skeptical, but decided why not. Hands down it was the best combinations of flavors. The Ruben had great carved texture with pepper edges. I too must jump on the bandwagon. I loved that the pretzel bun was cooked perfectly it was warm, brown and soft. Normally pretzel buns get hard as they cool in temperature. But not in this case. I did get my cole slaw on the side. Amazing sandwich that kicked my filet taste buds out my mouth. I could eat this Ruben multiple times a week. I also suggest during happy hour to try the mule cocktail  or carne asada nachos.",

We ordered other things, such as the popcorn shrimp and cheeseburger, but the best thing by far was the pretzel fondu.  YUMMY.    Service was fantastic as well.

For our main entree, I had the jambalaya & my partner had the ribs.  OMG...they were SO delicious.  Initially I was concerned that the jambalaya would be too spicy, but I'm glad I went with my gut because it was the most flavorful & not too spicy.  For dessert, we had the peanut butter cup and it was a surprisingly unique sweet.  The 2 peanut butter cookies with a chocolate drop center were the perfect finish to the dessert. The service was a bit slow, but we were not in a hurry.  Although slow, our server was very attentive & helpful when present. We most definitely will be back to try some of the other enticing dishes.  2 thumbs up from both of us!",

We waited for almost an hour to be seated while the staff kept saying the group before us was here for almost 2 1/2 hours and that's why we weren't being seated.  The entire time we stood at the front door we watched the back room where there were two sections of tables with seating for 10-12 each which were fully set and nobody was at the tables.  We asked several times if we could be seated there and were told yes those were our seats but they couldn't find anyone to seat us.......um why can't one of you who keeps saying we can't find anyone to seat you?  When we were finally seated the gentlemen walked us half way to the back and then pointed and said those seats on the left our for you.  Thanks for making us wait 45 minutes for that.  Our drink orders took almost another 45 minutes to arrive and when they started one person at the table received their drink twice and the rest of us were still waiting.  The table next to us who sat down after us was so fed up they started walking up to the bar and were able to get their drinks before our table was served!    When the food finally arrived around 10:30 it was horrible and outside of the steak and meatloaf ordered everyone at the table was disappointed.  Needless to say my wife was unhappy we chose this place for her birthday and would never want to return.",

First, when my friend and I walked in we had to get the hostess attention. She asked how many and then literally went back to her computer without saying anything. We waited for a few moments and then asked whether or not there was a wait and if we should just sit down. She said no and continued to do nothing. Finally, a waitress sat us where she pointed to the table and threw the menus as she walked away. We got our waters without any straws and had to walk up to ask for some. The food was over priced for the portions we received and the strawberry lemonade was bitter for being four dollars. Though, the waiter we ended up getting was a kind gentleman.   Overall, the food was good but small and over priced, they seemed over staffed and not very busy but everything all together seem like a slow process. There were employees gathered at the back just talking and the managers didn't seem too friendly. I wouldn't go back or recommend this restaurant.  P.S. for being a meat based restaurant, they sure didn't have any sauces. They only had to offer ketchup, ranch, and blue cheese. No bar-b-que????",

    "text": "I was in town for a couple days with friends and came here for happy hour since it received great yelp reviews and a thumbs up from our hotel staff. We had a few of the happy hour cocktails- house white, the maid (was ok,  tasted like a margarita couldn't taste the cucumber at all and had way too much ice. It was literally 2 large swallows and gone) the fix (too sweet and again way to much ice) and the mule (served in a glass not the standard copper mug a mule should be in and was also just filled up with ice) none of the drinks seemed to have much alcohol so it may almost be better to skip happy hour drinks unless you're getting beer or wine. We had an app from the happy hour menu, house soft pretzels which they came out nice and warm but the provolone had no taste, just a cream sauce. Definitely  did not taste like provolone. For our meals I had a cheese and prosciutto board, the truffled crescenza cheese was really good, the prosciutto was just ok. I've had a lot of similar meat boards in NYC and Boston and this was not even comparable. Not good quality of meat and not enough for the $10 price (the crusty bread and mustard accompanying the dish was also a disappointment. I mean, who serves mustard with a prosciutto plate??) The bread was flavorless and too thickly cut for the small pieces of meat. I ordered a couple of the extras - prosciutto deviled eggs (awfully dry and flavorless) and roasted beets (honestly the best part of my meal). Two in my party had the cheeseburger they said were good, not great, and one of us had the crab legs which were ok but after she ate them she was still hungry so ordered a burger to go. The prize of the meal was the salted carmel pudding which the waitress told us won a couple awards in the city and it was delicious! All in all, we would probably not go back next trip, there are so many restaurants in the area. I also want to mention how lovely our waitress was, very friendly and attentive and answered all our questions. Great service here but the food was not up to par.",

Service: The hostess was very rude, it looked like she was mad and had communication problems because we simply just stood there waiting for her to tell us how long the wait was.  A waitress finally took us to our table and literally threw the menus on the table and didn't say a thing. Then, another waitress brought us some water without a straw.  We had to ask another employee for straws which was kinda hard to do because it looked like all the waiters were busy walking back and forth even though the restaurant was not busy at all.  Then, ANOTHER waiter came to take our order, he was very nice and professional.  Food:  My friend order the Fish N Chips.. she said it was nothing out of the ordinary and it was definitely not worth the $17.  I ordered their cheeseburger with a side salad.  The burger was ok but it was again nothing out of the ordinary and it was a little cold.  The salad was HORRIBLE! I mean I don't expect a bar to have great salads but come on this salad looked and tasted horrible.",

A party of four, we were served no vegetable on any of our dishes  - just some raw leaves sprinkled atop my Mahi-mahi, which was the size of a medium stick of butter. On the upside, the wait staff was very young and attractive. Oh, you have to wait nearly forever for the wine because it has to be apportioned out from the bar into a tiny carafe  - very lame!  You do get an empty stem glass right away. (Probably due to the underage wait staff).  Be sure to say to the waiter while pointing to your glass after 20 minutes of waiting, \"that wine was good, can I have another?''  They will love you for it.  And then when we finished off our food,  this homeless looking older guy in jeans and plaid shirt came to our table to ask how things were going.  I assumed he wanted my leftovers.  We gave him a strange look and asked who he was. Turns out he was the manager.  No he didn't seem arrogant! Unless you count making your staff wear a white shirt, black slacks, apron and tie while you dress  like you just stepped off a big-rig :).",

The good: 1) Really lively / trendy place, great for hanging out for drinks.   2) Good beer and cocktail selection.   3) Wait staff was very friendly.   4) The sea bass was very good.  The improvement areas: 1) Hostess team significantly under-estimated wait time for a table.  Not helpful as we had a business commitment later that evening.  This created a rushed experience 2)  Food was good, but didn't live up to the hype.  Interesting, creative menu, but lacking 'fillers' to go with the expensive fancy entrees.   Overall, good place for happy hour and when dining on the company's dime.",

    "text": "From start to finish, The Arrogant Butcher was the perfect choice for our small group. There were about 8 of us, and we were lucky enough to be seated in the semi-private booth/banquette area in the back, and fortunate enough to be treated to lovely service throughout our visit. The atmosphere is so cool and definitely not what an out-of-towner who is clearly out-of-touch with how downtown Phoenix has changed was expecting. Our local person, who brought us here, explained that all of the Fox Restaurant Concepts locations have a slick vibe without coming across as contrived.  While the name \"Arrogant Butcher\" might imply an overabundance of cured meats on the menu, I was happy to see that there were many fresh options as well, for both the vegetarians as well as the non-salami eaters. We overlooked the appetizer menu (although I've heard the pretzels with provolone fondue are amazing) and went right for the cheese and charcuterie boards, passing those around the table as we enjoyed our drinks. There's a healthy selection of hosue-crafted cocktails and a nice wine selection, but the on-draught beers are lacking a bit. To accompany your meats-and-cheese boards, there are many \"Extras\" you can add for a well-rounded experience, such as Marcona almonds, cornichons, peppers, etc. It's a great way to have a more social appetizer with your group as you wait for entrees.  While meat-based mains range from seafood to ribs to chicken to New Zealand Sea Bass, there's also a nice selection of vegetarian items, such as Sweet Potato Tortelli. Personally, I opted for one of their big entree salads, and was really happy with the Tabbouleh Salad. My coworkers raved about the NZ Sea Bass, the Short Ribs, the Pork Carnitas, and the signature AB Cheeseburger.  Their desserts are also worth the cost of admission and the calories. We shared one of each of the 4 desserts; each item is $6 and a nice portion. My personal favorite was the Warm Peanut Butter Cup with chocolate gelato.  Definitely a cool, hip spot for small groups with varying tastes and varying budget per diems, but also a nice spot for when someone else is footing the bill!",

Since then each visit just gets worse. This time a 530 early bite before attending the Symphony. We arrived and the hostesses were great our reservation was ready as arranged. We opted to sit at the bar as spots were available. We ordered a cocktail from a particularly non communicative bartender and asked a few questions about the menu to which we got one line answers. I was having a bad feeling about this. Cocktails came and my partners drink was fabulous. A rum cocktail w muddled fruit that she said was great. We toasted the evening and I noticed that my vodka tonic was not quite right. The tonic mix had run out on the bartenders gun. Hey it happens. The resolution to this small issue ruined the evening. The staff were rude and not helpful They did comp the drink and I did tip appropriately but we left without having dinner and will not return. I cannot imagine how this place stays so busy when we have seen nothing but poor performance on three out of four visits. Oh yes, Location, Location, Location.",

I tried two happy hour drinks, The Mule and The Maid,  both were excellent. Happy hours prices seem decent to me.  The only food we had was appetizers but the pretzel fondue is amazing. It is so good that we ordered it both nights. Bread and oil is good and so is the chicken pate.  The real shining star of this restaurant has to be the service. We had several different people at our tables both nights and they were all super nice. The server from our first night even remembered us and came up to our table on the second night to talk to us.  I swear I don't work here (I live in Vegas) but I felt compelled to review after reading some negative reviews. Come for happy hour before a game, but come early The Arrogant Butcher is popular and the bar fills up.",

I was not only disappointed, but disgusted. I eat out a lot, so I know good chicken when I see it and this was not it. The batter on the chicken was still not cooked through and neither was the chicken. When we told the server they asked if we would like to have it remade and I said no. We ended up only paying for the meal my boyfriend got, but even he did not enjoy his steak. I would not be upset if that was all, this place ended up giving me food poisoning from the two small bites of chicken I had. Save your money and visit a REAL steak house like Mastro's city hall, Flemings, or Steak 44, AND WHATEVER YOU DO, STAY AWAY FROM THE CHICKEN!",

Well you'd be wrong. Every single one of us that ordered steak received it overcooked. I ordered mine medium and was served leather on a plate. We made management aware of this yet when the bills came we all were charged full price. Which was about $70 per person. After my friend went up to the manager to fight for my bill, because I had only 1 bite of steak and the rest sat on my plate, were we all given a 50% discount. I will not dine here again.

    "text": "My wonderful Yelpy App helped me discover this place while at a conference at the PCC. Myself and four friends came here for happy hour after our conference and were not let down. We were immediately seated in the patio and greeted by a very friendly server. Since we had never been here he was very helpful in explaining the menu, happy hour options, and making recommendations. We took a little while to decide, but they were patient and accommodating. Between the four of us, we ordered \"The Mule\", \"The Maid and \"The Fix\" as drinks and \"The House Soft Pretzels,\" \"The Artichoke Hummus,\" \"The Zucchini Fritters,\" and a cheese plate to split. All were delicious. However, there is a reason that the Pretzels and Fondue are mentioned in 53 reviews! If you come here for nothing else, at least try these once in your life. Each of us ended up liking the others' drink and for our second round ordered two Mules and two Maids. Our waiters knew there were four of us, yet they only brought two pieces of bread with the cheese plate. This made us all look at each other awkwardly, and we had to wait a little bit before we got more bread, but this really wasn't a huge deal in the overall experience.  Yes, I switched our server from he to they, because all of a sudden it seemed like we had four different waiters. I'm not sure how they did it, but every time we needed something, any server would help us, bring us what we needed, and the other servers somehow seemed to know what the others had done. If this was just a fluke then it went over just fine, but if this is their serving concept, I recommend that they explain it when they approach the table. A lot of other reviewers have mentioned the awesome atmosphere, corner hugging location, and decor, and I must agree that this place has it all. Upon sitting, I immediately recognized the red metal chairs and asked if this was a FOX concept, because they were the exact same ones I had sat in at the newly redesigned NoRTH in Tucson. Now I see why they were trying to duplicate the look of the Phoenix location, it's pretty awesome.",

    "text": "Very disappointing. Early reviews were solid but I see why many have left poor reviews as of late. Atmosphere is nice and a great location downtown. In spite of this, management is doing a bad job at running the restaurant. They were out of half their tap beers as well as many of their bottled beers.  How does that happen?  I think alcohol and beer vendors deliver daily. I don't think I've ever seen that before other than maybe a backyard party at my buddy's. Service was extremely lackluster. Servers and food runners basically were doing us a favor by doing their job. Don't ask for a serving spoon to share a salad because if you do, they will give you stink eye, a deep sigh, and if you're lucky, give you a teaspoon.  The fish and chips were one level above Long John Silver. Actually LJS is better and their charcuterie is average at best with horrible presentation and delivery. The only reason this place gets 2 stars instead of 1 is that the beet salad was terrific!  Other than that I would avoid this place at all costs. Not worth the money and definitely not worth the aggravation of dealing with staff that have no interest in making the customer experience enjoyable.  Go to Hannys down the street instead. Same type of eclectic menu with solid service and actually a fully stocked bar!",
