    "text": "What a spectacularly neat place. I first visited with a long, leisurely lunch right when they opened. Very recently I stopped in during the hustle bustle of a busy Saturday night. This place is popular with good reason! It's fun!   Right, and the killer HH has absolutely nothing to do with it. [whistling, whistling, whistling.] 3pm to Close.   E v e r y d a y.  Do you like beer? Five bucks will buy you a pitcher.   [Give me a moment before I continue.] Pints are four bucks. Cocktails are five. And wine, [oh geez], house wine is five bucks.  The layout of the space is mixed, with bar top seating, couches, tables and outdoor space. If you'd like to sit at a table, be sure you walk to the *back* of the restaurant (where the pastries are) to see the hostess.   We totally goofed and misunderstood this crucial tidbit of information. Serena, our bomb-diggity-server, came to the rescue by buying a pitcher and (!) some cookies! (We had been reseated, met a number of different servers and misplaced on the line queue. Totally our fault for misunderstanding which counter the sign up front referred to. We walked towards the bar, and a hostess seated us at a reserved table.)  None of that matters. We had an awesome time! Cookies! Beer! And really good burgers. The AZ Burger with Green Chile was delivered as requested with pinkness. Can't wait to go back! The only issue will be is the wait time. I can't imagine wanting to leave. Meh :)  Oh! Also, this place is kid friendly, with plenty of toys available for the tykes to make friends with. Oh! Oh! Plenty of parking is available.  Over and out.",

The three of us were famished and we were looking for a small joint near downtown where we were attending a handful of First Friday events. When we arrived it was very busy, but we quickly understood just why it was so popular.   The three of us sat outside right next to a crackling fire place and waited to be served. We were quickly greeted with a carafe of water to sip on while we decided on what we wanted. Our server let us know what they we sold out of before we wasted our time trying to figure out our options. Once we ordered, we had only a short amount of time to speak amongst ourselves before the food came out. The food was splendid and our drinks were divine. Our waiter was the coolest kat. Loved it!",

My favorite is the Arizona burger - always cooked to perfection. The meat literally melts in your mouth. I always say I want to try their bakery items but I'm too full from lunch. Coffee is always good. Fries are delicious and crispy. The Cubano is amazing. But if you haven't tried the AZ Burger try it now thanks.",

THE RACHEL ($8.95) - rotisserie turkey, coleslaw, sauerkraut, swiss cheese, house dressing, melted on sourdough  - all flavors blended well together that each bite was enjoyable - turkey wasn't too dry - quite small for the price, nonetheless would recommend!  CORN COOKIE ($1.25) - FREE cookie with Yelp check-in - weird taste; too gritty and not much flavor - would not say I'm a fan  ENVIRONMENT: hipster feel. embraces community eating and definitely does have a market appeal. There is a coffee bar to one side of the place. The patio is perfect for those cool summer nights or when it's happy hour. Great place to catch up with people.  SERVICE: staff members were friendly. Food for take-out was prepared quickly. Had no issues with applying the student discount and Yelp check-in on one transaction.   Great place to grab a sandwich or come to after work. The environment is very chill and open to making new friends. The food is solid, and there is a great variety that something is there for everyone. I would come back and recommend it to anyone looking for a casual quality sit-down cafe...with booze.",

It tasted like it was from yesterday(even if the guy at the register said they make them fresh every day) and a moist feel. They should not bake all of them in the morning but rather bake small amounts during the whole day. I come from the land that invented Pretzels :) and I would not eat a pretzel there again but their other food for sure.",

Sure, it might be a bit $$ for some sandwiches, but I don't mind because I know they keep it local, in season, and I've had nothing but good service here. There is indoor and outdoor seating (with misters outside so get it in before the temps hit 100's) with a mix of long family style benches, regular seating, and bar seating. There are a few items for sale here, including some local olive oils and knick knacks, nothing like the old Public Market used to be, but I think that's why this place is far more successful than before.   My favorites include the Del Real sandwich, the lentil curry coconut soup (a mouthful to say, but damn tasty), and the Mediterranean Salad. It's a solid spots for your crazy vegan, gluten, dairy free friend. Also, always ask about the special of the day. I've had some amazing sandwiches from some crazy pork belly to mozzarella flat breads. The pork chile verde pot pie is also tasty, but can sell out quick some days.   Happy hour starts at 3PM every day and doesn't end until the places closes. That my friends, is how every happy hour should be! $5 house wines, $5 pitchers of select beers on tap (seasonal rotation) and $3 well drinks. I believe there are also some $5 cocktails as well. Basically, come after a long crappy day, get buzzed, eat solid food and enjoy yourself.   Expect a crowd a lunch, there aren't many non-shit places downtown to grab a bite to eat, so they office drones come out in herds. Food truck Friday's are awesome, yes it can get hot as hell in the summer, but it's Arizona, go get a popsicle from a vendor and sit under the tent/run back to your airconditioned car. Wednesday nights and Saturday mornings host farmers market which is great.   Ask for Leigh as your waiter, he's hysterical, gives great recommendations for booze and has some stories about the Galapagos.",

I ordered takeout here so my experience is not based on dining in the restaurant.  I ordered a chicken salad sandwich and it was pretty good.  The bread was very toasty (I love that) and they had seeds inside the sandwich that kept the chicken from feeling mushy when taking bites.  However, the portions were a little underwhelming for what I paid for.  I got a toasted sandwich with no sides for $10.  The atmosphere is great.  The restaurant is dimly lit with candles, wood tables, and a brick interior.  They play some hip music and have a bar.  I can see how this can be a hotspot for a young crowd and students.  Unfortunately, I came alone and did not dine in.  Good atmosphere, but I was a bit disappointed by what I paid for.  This definitely a place you go to with some friends to grab a meal or some drinks.",

Crowd was a mixed type but leaned towards upwardly mobile hipsters? Some decent craft beers on tap, some wine offered as well. Really great cocktails.  Menu is fairly vast and diverse, I settled on the pretzels (delish with creamy cheese sauce) and the fried chicken (not so great).   Servers and helpers were beyond friendly yet completely disorganized this night, but I was in a good mood and opted not to make their lives miserable. Plus they acknowledged every error and forgetful act and we received a majority of the meal for nothing. Big props for that.   Overall I'll be back.

I had a cinnamon roll that topped the charts of all cinnamon rolls I have ever had. And I have had my share. It was warm and fluffy, with just the right amount of frosting and cinnamon.  Coffee is great and if you want a drink their bartenders know what they are doing.  They will craft you a well mixed drink or pour you one of the many delicious beers they offer.  I often frequent on Saturdays during the farmers market but prefer other days when it is less busy.",

I had to ask for a plate and the girl wiped my plate dry with the towel she had at the counter. What else did that towel wipe? So I just used the paper wrapping as my plate. I ate like 1/4, if that. It crumbled into lots of pieces every time I tried to cut a small piece. Ended up with a big mess. And, I just thought it was weird it wasn't served warm. I decided to look for something else after that. It was a meh experience for my very short visit. Just my two cents.",

Service was excellent, in fact amongst hundred of people that file in each day I'm sure, one of the guys recognized me and said welcome back. The macaroons are some of the best I've ever had. Their farmers market on Saturday mornings is excellent as well, too many things I couldn't bring back with me on the plane. Too building and set up they have. Highly recommend and I'll be back!",

    "text": "After craving a late breakfast, I sat at the bar and ordered the Rooster Booster. This meal consists of 2 eggs any style, bacon, toast, and potatoes. I inquired if I could alter this by subbing chorizo instead of bacon and replacing the toast with their farm vegetables, which was braised turnips and Swiss chard that day. The bartender was very nice and said it should be no problem at all. My plate arrived not long after and it was overflowing with foodporn. Even the guy who brought it to me from the kitchen said, \"Here you go, that looks *really* good!\" And let me say, this meal was EXACTLY what I was looking for. I fully regret not taking a picture of the beautiful and colorful bounty. I crave vegetables (morning, noon, and night) and breakfasts often fall extremely short of them. The turnips and chard were unbelievably good and tied everything together wonderfully.  I pleasantly surprised when receiving the bill to discover that I was not charged for adding farm vegetables. Super score!  If you are looking for organic, local food in a relaxed and comfortable environment, look no further and support this terrific cafe!!",

    "text": "OK - to preface everything - I sincerely like the food at this place. I like the space itself, indoors and out, and want to support local restaurants, farmers, artisans, etc. For the most part, I am docking this place down for terrible service and a terrible service model for food that isn't cheap.  The fact of the matter is that this place operates on a Pei-Wei type service model. Order at the front, tip (for service you don't receive) and your food is brought out to you and you are never talked to again. Fill your own water. Wait, you want another drink, well go get it yourself from the bar.  However, what seems to be the service exception is the bar. Which is why I like to sit at the bar. You're supposed to have service because you are paying after you eat.  But - you see, I have been here probably 5 times in the past 4 weeks. Out of those times, I would say 4 of them I or my friends have had to flag down the bartender or the server (not sure if they are really supposed to be servers, because they don't ask how your food is, or provide much service other than delivering the food) in the restaurant for an item. And  I mean chase a bartender/server down to get a drink when there is no one at the bar. The seats at the bar weren't always filled, and bartenders aren't stressed with orders, just dawdling and not paying attention to customers at all. Cleaning the espresso machine, making lemon twists, making orange juice, not paying any attention to what is going on with their customers. Each time I have been seated at a bar, the bartender has never proactively ever asked me what I would like to drink, nor have they asked if I would like a refill.   Same goes for the restaurant - seated at a table - our food took 25-30 mins to come out, (fries 5 mins after the burger) and after it came out, the server was nowhere to be found. (But again, are they really servers? Are they supposed to provide service?) All we needed was some extra silverware and some extra ketchup. (Fries only come with one little cup of ketchup) Once we saw her, I ordered a new drink - and that took another 15-20 minutes to come out, at which time, I was close to finished with my food.  Overall, when the food comes out, it is good. However, the burger is $10 and doesn't include fries ($3 and ask for them extra crispy)... and remember... no service. So I am conflicted - if I want a good burger and no service, I might as well go to Five Guys (cheaper and better) or it's this place's sister restaurant St. Francis, where I can pay about the same price for burger and fries and have a server.  Finally, the local wares. Yes! I want to support local - I'm not sure who is doing the pricing on these items. A cotton grocery bag with a screen print of the logo - $14? That is nuts! I can get one at Fresh and Easy for $.99. Again, I get the local thing. But appropriate pricing is also relevant. A 2.2 lb bag of flour for $9? I would pay around $5 - because it's local, but $9? When the pricing is so drastically different than what you can get at the grocery store ($2.49 for 5 lbs of flour) it does a disservice to local producers as the price is so disproportionate its somewhat unaffordable to buy local. (And 2.2 lbs of flour isn't going to last long.)   I would definitely encourage you to try this out (and the market next door). It's definitely worth a look. Just don't expect any service.",

Chris was spectacular. I saw the sign that said SunDevils get a 20 percent discount so I jokingly asked if alums who are teachers could too. He jumped all over it. What a guy. The food was okay. I got a Curry chicken sandwich with a side of garlic mashed potatoes. It was good. However, even with the discount the place is pricey for lunch. How do college students afford to eat here?   The concept and decor is great and they have a Cartel coffee bar inside which is one of my favs in the valley. For dessert I got an Expresso Macaroon since my phone died before i could cash in the free check in cookie offer. I did not think it was as good as other places that make them locally. That could have just been my own tastebuds though and no fault of the establishment. Overall a nice place. i believe I will come back again if I am in the area. I love Downtown Phoenix.",

Corn Cookie - corn flour, sweet corn cookie, has a slight corn taste that is not too overwhelming. This cookie is much stiffer and crispier due to the corn flour I assume.  Cinnamon Roll - AMAZING, highly recommend trying if you like cinnamon rolls.  Devil's Mess -  a pretty standard scramble with a tortilla on the side.  I love the atmosphere here, there are a lot of communal tables with great rustic decorations. There's a separate order counter for food and for coffee drinks, you order first and snag a number before finding your own table. This is a great place to have a nice casual meal.",

Cons: We drove over an hour to have dinner with friends visiting from out of state and chose this place due to their menu stating specific gf options. This restaurant is severely misguided on what the gf is. You cannot label French fries as gf then verbally give a disclaimer of them being fried in the same fryer as their fried chicken. My children were stoked about being able to have french fries which is a rarity only to not be able to have them.   I will never return or recommend this place to anyone for the simple fact that they mislabel and misrepresent their menu items which is huge. I also run a local GF group which I recommend places to and this will obviously not be one of them.    Super disappointed in what could have been a new weekend destination.",

I've never had a disappointing meal or mediocre service. All the staff are so cool you'll feel like they're longtime friends. Any chance I get to come here, I'm here. & in case I haven't said enough, they have an Open Air Market every Saturday morning. Come check it out & support local farmers & small businesses. I love you, Phoenix Public Market!",

The dining area is spacious with a bar top and open patio area.  It was a pretty busy weekend and only offers counter service (no wait staff), but the line went quickly and our food came out within a couple of minutes.  We ordered two teas, two entrees, and a side for about $30.  The food was very tasty and their menu has a great variety of both breakfast and lunch items.  So glad we found this spot and will definitely be back!",

Each server had the same reactions- everything is sooooo amazing! No lie! And, they were right! Everything was fresh, delicious and had that homemade taste. I even stopped by on my last day to get a to go order for the airport. When they found out it was for the airport they packaged everything special to keep items from getting soggy and even put my dressings in small, tight containers so they would be cleared for TSA 3-1-1 rules on liquids. They definitely didn't want my dressing to not be cleared through security! :) Looking forward to visiting Phoenix again just to eat here. FYI- they also have a full bar and outside seating.",

Three dollar kid's meals, with a donation going to feed hungry children in Phoenix with every kid's meal sold. How nice is that?  Dog friendly as well. We sat on the patio with our pooch in tow.

The Cuban sandwich was surprisingly good. The best part about this place was probably the free cookies with Yelp check-in. I'd first recommend getting the oatmeal apricot banana cookie, or the ballerina cookie if you're craving something chocolatey!

Let me first start by saying there was no fountain drinks. NO fountain drinks?!?! I get it, the place edges on the healthier side of things but dang if your going to kick out desserts, let a brother enjoy a little soda action. They do have Coke in the bottle, but come on that ain't the same. As for my buddies carrot cake, it was okay. One perk to being a yelper, your friends have to let you try their food. Come on, I am serving the community one taste at a time. Back to the carrot cake, it was dense and had a decent flavor. It seemed to have a slight heat aftertaste, which seemed a little odd to us. As for my pulled pork, it was pretty good. As other reviews mention, it could have used a little more sauce. The sauce though was good and I would order it again. A decent 4 stars in my book. The sandwich came with fries which were also pretty tasty. Lastly, with my Yelp check in they provided a free cookie. Can't say no to that! It was good, had nice flavor, I personally do not love though airy, puffy cookies. Overall, the restaurant had a neat vibe and the food was pretty good. Would stop by again, just with my own soda beverage in hand.",

I so did not expect Phoenix to have a place like this.  The decor is open, with rustic-farm appointments, and a deli-like ordering area in the back. We opted for communal seating over the bar area and outside tables. Service staff was super friendly and the place was hopping.  All the food was yummers. Best described as simple and tasty fare. My burger was straight good and wasn't overcomplicated by odd pairings. My wife loved her Cubano while our girls liked their AB&J sandwiches. The pretzel app was a hit, too.  As much as anything, the collegial atmosphere was fun and made the experience better. We chatted with a skinny young woman who was demolishing her prime rib and making me feel like less of a man with how she tore through it. Fun gal and always good to meet new people in a social eating setting. Kind of like an anglo version of a luau. lol  Wrapped up, I was impressed that the meal for four actually came with a reasonable price. So, we fixed that by ordering some extra dessert to go: Macaroons!",

    "text": "My food was delicious but it was a little pricey. My sandwich, fries and lemonade ended up costing about $24.00 including the tip. That's a lot of a weekday lunch. I had the Cuban sandwich and it was fantastic. The fries were cooked just as a like them and the peach lemonade was amazing. I need to try and figure out how to replicate it at home.  My co-worker ordered the BBQ sandwich and several different cookies for us a to share. The cookies were good but so rich and buttery. We both left stuffed and happy but despite the food being great I won't be going back anytime soon because it is a little pricey for lunch for me.",

I've come at all different hours and days and it never seems to be too crowded, not sure why, the food is great. I've tried their chicken quesadilla which is delicious although I wish they added more quicken.  Their pulled pork sand which is also very tasty, and is what I typically recommend my friends who want to try this place out. Their devil fries are also pretty darn good and have a nice kick to them. Their grandmother's cake or whatever the chocolate cake is called is mouth watering for those who ,like myself, love chocolate. It's pretty rich so I can't eat a whole slice but who doesn't like left overs!?   Anyhow to summarize this review, check this place out, nothing on their menu has disappointed me yet and it's a cute place, who doesn't like cute things.",

A bit on the loud side for phone conversations, but not excessive for socializing.  Ordered the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie, did not regret it one bit.  PERFECT crust! Thick top layer, thin sides, great color, nice, crisp edges.  The Chile was amazing! Good colors, great flavor profile, excellent heat, big chunks of pork.  The portion size was just about perfect, though I could have easily consumed another.  I waited far too long to dine at the market. My experience was fantastic!",

Some general thoughts:  - You order at the counter, they issue you a number, and then you wait. The cafe was busy with dine-in and to-go orders so we waited about 20 minutes for our food.   - Coffee was good. I had the drip with a little sugar while my boyfriend had a latte of sorts. We both liked our drinks.   - We waited about 15-20 minutes for a table to open up (or even just a corner of a table). Most people were loitering; they obviously finished their food well before we arrived and were just hanging out, watching us and some other folks lurk around for a table. That was rude.   - Once some tables opened up, we ended up sharing one of the larger ones with a couple of ASU guys. I thought the communal tables were going to be awkward but there was just enough room between us that it wasn't.  - I ordered a frittata with arugula and pesto. It was massive and probably met my protein intake for the day. I ate it all though :)  - The guys next to us both had a rice bowl. It looked really good and I may order that next time.",

We were driving up to the Grand Canyon, so we wanted something fast, but filling.  We spotted Public Market Cafe & decided to head it. I absolutely loved it! It was so trendy & reminded me of the West Loop in Chicago (it's an up-and-coming trendy/hipster area that I adore). The decor & vibe was just incredible.  I'm a dairy-free vegetarian, so sometimes finding something other than salad can be hard, luckily Public Market Cafe had tons of options to choose from! I settled on the AB&J with a honey almondmilk latte.  I'm a travel blogger, so when I find places like this, I get so happy. Rarely do you find a place that's healthy, locally sourced, & delicious all in one.  If you want to read more about our stop at Public Market Cafe (or our trip in general), you can read about it in my blog post!  <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.humpsandpumps.com%2Fsingle-post%2FA-City-Girls-Guide-to-a-Weekend-in-Arizona&s=addd7af7e25976f9f16ac15b7da72e8e8e65f50bf0aa0bb6e3916cb1e48b9497\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">humpsandpumps.com/single...</a>",

Give the macaroons a shot, if you want a sweet treat; they've got a nice variety, and my girlfriend always picks up a few.  The service has been hit-or-miss, though two of the regular waitstaff are always friendly and excellent at their jobs. Don't expect them to perform like a typical waiter, though, that's not the set-up. Order at the counter, wait for your food to be dropped off, and leave it at that; they'll chat you up at the counter, joke, and make recommendations, but don't expect more.  I would give them a higher rating, but unfortunately, the past two times I've gotten coffee here, I got sick. I'm not a big coffee drinker, but I've tried a few places, and none of them have made me feel this bad afterwards. :-(",

I found out from the girl who cleared our table though that you are able to order a half order of the pancakes! Yay! Score for a $4 breakfast!   In addition, I'd been having a mad craving for a cinnamon roll for the past few weeks and I was surprised when I walked in and saw them in the display case.

I was told it used to be an old garage, and that's evident by the large windows.  There's also a community table for meeting new friends or gathering with large groups of your old friends.  I felt right at home.  Service was friendly and efficient.  The chips and guacamole came with a red and a green salsa. It was all good but I wish the portions of the dips were a bit more generous.  Speaking of generous I had a grain bowl with beets and arugula with a refreshing champagne vinaigrette.  The salad was light and filling all at the same time.  The portion was large enough to take half of it with me to enjoy the next day.  And, enjoy I did.  I look forward to my next trip to Phoenix to visit the Public Market Cafe.",

    "text": "I really like what they've done here. Although I came in here for a takeaway lunch I would love to come back some afternoon for a beer or glass of wine. I hope they add to the menu because it could have benefited from a few more items. I decided on the  burger which was WAY too much bun (but the fries were OK). I wanted something warm so I did not take enough time to take a look at what salads and other pre-prepared items they had in the cooler.  I waited for more than 5 minutes before I was acknowledged and my order taken......this was late afternoon so the place was not crowded. The man who took my order also was not familiar with how to ring me up so I think that once the staff is more experienced and perhaps the service fine tuned I'm sure this aspect of the business will be ship shape.  So while I wasn't wowed with my experience I'll definitely give these guys another try. Since the bar area is nice (and you can't screw up beer unless it's Natural Ice) I know I'm at least bound to enjoy knocking back a few here!",

I favored the red sauce which was about medium spicy but I think next time I might opt for a vinaigrette. They were out of Gancia for the Petals of Gancia cocktail but made something similar with an elderflower liqueur- I liked it enough to have a second. I took a vegan cookie to go which was deliciously eclectic; I wish I remembered what it was called.",

It's vegan without any modifications needed. Their bagels are perfect (hard on the outside, soft inside) and the hummus is among some of the best in the Valley. I also love the pickle!   Other vegan regulars for me include the black beans & rice (minus the cheese); chips, salsa and guac; lentil coconut curry soup; warm pretzels (minus the cheese, add mustard); the AB&J; and the Eat the Rainbow and rice bowls can be modified to be vegan. The fries are also great, and you can get a small side salad that's vegan. They also have a vegan apricot cookie for desert! For happy hour, try the sangria!  My only complaint is that there are no vegan breakfast options (aside from a bagel w/no topping and a fruit bowl. And I can't get the Roosevelt Row bagel for dinner, darn it. It would be nice if there were a few more vegan dinner options, but sometimes I just get fries and a side salad and am good to go.  Service is always great - prompt and friendly, and they've never messed up my vegan options. And the best part? The free sparkling water on tap! Whenever I can't decide where to go for lunch, the thought of the sparkling water makes the decision for me!",

It was just what I was craving.   To share was an order of devil fries, let me tell you, these guys are the bomb! Its French fries with peguin chili, garlic, parsley and parmesan. These guys have a kick to them and make it impossible to stop eating, and it also comes with some side sauces for dipping, but to honest I don't remember the sauces because the fries were great on their own.

It was so early that the market was just starting to get set up for the incoming masses, but the cafe was already open an hour and had quite a few diners devouring their breakfast plates. The Rooster Booster. Biscuits & Gravy. The Devil's Mess. Lots of chorizo, lots of carbs, very Southwest. Although the dishes all sounded delicious in their own artery-clogging kind of way, none of them sounded promising enough to appease my flexitarian dietary concerns.  I ended up ordering likely their most boring offering, the $7.25 bowl of Granola, Fruit, and Yogurt billed as vegetarian and gluten-free (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2iJZjxy&s=bc6ce7efeace68e22c97a200238188b80bb70d3723cd0fa9c5f358d2f5562814\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2iJZjxy</a>). It was certainly big enough, but the proportions appeared out of whack to me. The chunks of fresh Granny Smith apples comprised the most dominant ingredient, and the obviously housemade granola was poured liberally over it. What was missing for me was a hearty enough serving of yogurt to lubricate the granola and apples. I was only left with the mixed berries to help me down as much of the granola as I could, which was not even half of it. The coffee helped as the beans came from a local chain, Cartel Coffee Lab.  FOOD - 3 stars...hefty bowl of granola and not that satisfying, the salads sound promising AMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious and very Southwest SERVICE - 3 stars...on the meh side TOTAL - 3 stars...think I'll come back for lunch the next time",

Service is a little slow, but the hipster vibe is fun, and the coffee and food are delicious. I also like that they allowed me to customize my order- the breakfast burrito without the tortilla and added avocado. The portion was very satisfying, and they gave me a full chopped Avocado- my fav. I look forward to coming back sometime for lunch!",

I brought coworkers here for our usual Friday lunch out and someone ordered a salad that arrived with a dead cockroach hugging a piece of feta.  I wish this was a lie.  I have a picture.  And a mental image forever burned into my poor brain.  What was most disturbing was how the staff handled it.  The server told us that it's common to find \"natural elements\" in salads since they come fresh from a farm.  Uhhh, what? So, we pushed back and they took the dish back to the kitchen and without asking brought another salad.  Sorry, but we couldn't get that roach out of our heads.  When we told the server that we didn't want another salad with possible natural elements, the salad was whisked away.  And that was it.  Not \"What can we get you instead\" or \"Can we give you a refund.\"  I'll miss you, Pot Pie.",

Coworkers weren't terribly happy with their food either. Their orders ranged from quesadillas to burgers and sandwiches.   I'm so disappointed because I'd heard great things about this place, but I was totally let down. The 20% discount with ASU ID was nice but it's not enticing enough to make me want to go back.

    "text": "There aren't a lot of choices for breakfast downtown on New Year's morning. Of course, Matt's was open but the line was so long it would be January 2nd before we got seated. And besides we wanted to try something new to start the New Year off.  We had just stayed down the street at the newly restored Art Deco Hilton Garden hotel and despite it having a chain-name it really felt like a part of Phoenix's core.  Chain-name places of any type usually don't even make our short list at all.  So after driving over to another nearby place that was doing everything in their power to communicate they didn't want any customers (which worked really well ... we walked out), we came here.  Phoenix Public Market Cafe is only a couple of years old but somehow feels like it has deeper roots, especially to the cadre of local neighbors who were walking over for breakfast.  Not pretentious people, nor is the cafe pretentious. There are a lot of things to like about it. But we came for food, and right off I got good vibes about the menu choices.  I opted for The Devil's Mess (3 eggs, Schreiner's chorizo, tortilla, fire-roasted salsa, chiles & onions scrambled), which at $7.95 is a cheap eats bargain.  The amount of food served is impressive and tasted good.  The place was pretty full but our food was delivered in only about 5 minutes.  I don't have a picture of it (I was hungry) but I will say that I ate the whole thing. Overall they had a lot of interesting menu choices - definitely not your typical restaurant breakfast fare!  The surroundings are comfortable, neither fancy nor divey.  They did I good job at not becoming a cliche. The people who work there seem to be VERY happy and content, and hey, isn't that the way it should be to start a new day in a new year?  Kiddingly I said I was reluctant to write a review because Guy Fieri might find out about this place and then everyone will know about it.  But for now, let's keep it between just you and me ... this may be the best breakfast spot in Phoenix.",

Usually restaurants give you tiny pieces of the flower, which are too small for me to appreciate. This cauliflower was huge and I could cut it to my liking and fully enjoy the roasted flavor. The garlic mashed potatoes were also tasty and smooth! I wasn't a huge fan of their salad, their dressing was a little too sour, but I also wasn't too hungry after the other two items of the meal.   I would definitely return here to try one of their sandwiches, or for another cauliflower. I also had their cowgirl cookie which was YUMMY! (and free cookie with Yelp Checkin!!)",

    "text": "I don't think I give 5 stars often but on the items we ordered, they deserve 5 stars.  Ordered the salmon which was pan seared crispy on one side, and rare plus on the inside.  It was seriously one of those unique times when a restaurant just cooked a piece of salmon perfectly.  We also had the green chile pork pot pie.  Crust was good, crispy and doughy and very comforting.  The green chile sauce was very flavorful and tasty as well.  I had their house chardonnay which was pretty affordable.  It's a coffee house/hipster vibe so it's casual and also a place you can eat and just hang out as well.  They have a great drink selection (including craft cocktails), I didn't try the cocktails but they all looked good.  Also a full selection of coffee as well.  Convenient to the downtown area and a great alternative to some of the more expensive and probably not good restaurants in downtown.  Also got a free cookie for yelp check-in!  Peanut butter was great but so is the smore cookie!",

The food was good-- I had the pulled pork, served with fries and... a giant piece of fresh watermelon. Seasoning on the pulled pork was wonderful, very tender.  Service: I think maybe I just have weird looks on my face normally, but the staff is pretty hip and sometimes the service feels a little icy. Nothing bad, they're just not as warm as other waiters I've had.  Definitely coming back again, although I'm not a vegetarian they had some dishes on the menu that sounded delicious-- a good option if you want to eat out, but on the lighter side.",

I was expecting it to be like any other restaurant coffee: mildly drinkable. However, I actually asked for an extra cup without ice to take home for the next morning. The burger was astounding, the open face almond butter+apples+jam sandwich was perfection. It's a place I'd like to go for a cocktail with my friends at night, but also I place I can imagine spending time in the afternoon studying (they have outlets at every table!!).

We ate here the day after Christmas, and it is a cosy dinner (or lunch/breakfast) spot, with wood plank picnic style tables and some regular tables too, as well as outdoor patio seating.  The inside looks rustic, with brick walls and open wood beam ceiling.  Candles and succulents were on each table, and funky art and decor on the walls.  It smells so good as you walk in the doors, and you can see samples of their dinner fare as you walk in, along with a pastry counter with delicious looking items all lined up to tempt you to lose your waist line.  Yum.  We were seated quickly on a Friday night, started out with some drinks (pitcher of beer- small, enough for two, okay, and that was a server error, we did not order the pitcher, and I had a Market Margareta, which was pink, lemony and delicious).  We also ordered chips and salsa (included guacamole, and two types of salsas, one green and one red.) The chips were freshly made with just enough salt, and the guacamole and salsas were also tasty.    Decisions, decisions.  What to order?  I asked the waitress what she recommended, and there were so many things she said were great, I was a little skeptical, ha, but my husband ordered the pot pie (raved about on Yelp), and I ordered the rotisserie chicken.  The pot pie is not your mama's pot pie.  It is a delicious pastry shell filled with chili verde.  It was melt in your mouth delicious with a mild spicy flavor, that did not overpower.  My rotisserie chicken was neatly cut into manageable pieces which I appreciated because sometimes eatting chicken can get very messy.  It was moist and flavorful, and perfect.  It included two sides, and I chose a salad, and baked sweet potatoes.  The salad was small, with spinach and carrots, sliced red pepper and tomato, pretty little salad.  The baked sweet potatoes were to die for if you like sweet potato.  They had a lime butter sauce on top to give them a little kick, and they just melted away in deliciousness.  Yum yum yum.    Also, get a free cookie if you check in on Yelp.  Yep, we had to do that.  We had freshly made \"nutter-butter\" style peanut butter cookies, which I loved.  We ordered freshly made gingerbread loaf for breakfast the next morning.  Super yummy.    They are into fresh, organic and local foods, have cute planters with produce growing in the front, they have a bar area and a happy hour.  They have a lot to offer, and I would love to go back again, but since that would be a four hour drive for me, I will just have to wait until I come back to Phoenix.   Okay, go already.",

I like the casual community style seating (although the row of tables recently added does appear to be a bit tight). The service is usually friendly and efficient. I always order the salmon (either the dinner) or the rice bowl that comes with lots of veggies, then add grilled salmon as the protein option. They also have a good assortment of baked goods. I usually get a chocolate chip cookie for dessert (very chocolatey and fresh)! On occasion, I have ordered the prime rib, which is also done well, except it lacks an au jous. I also enjoy the whole roasted cauliflower (which can be ordered as a dinner with sides).  I can't say that I love everything on the menu. There's also a nice full service bar with TVs playing sports. Parking is free and convenient (which is a big plus being downtown).",

I had a standard eggs, bacon, potato, toast.  I asked for a extra egg it never showed up but my girlfriend order one egg scrambled on the side an I'm pretty sure my extra egg over easy made it in to her frying pan.    I don't get the counter service,  a number of places around town have it.  How much do I tip and how much are your servers getting paid?  What do I do if I feel that my visit was inadequate ? It seemed you were over staffed yet I didn't get the quality attention I expect.  A waiter needs the tips at the end to stay motivated.  I'm a waiter and I would hate having to run food here and not know from looking at the ticket who ordered which item, auction every plate of food at a table is bad service.  Your staff Is great they are friendly and comfortable with their roles, If any thing they could get pushed to work harder and make a few more bucks  with tips and hourly I hope your FOH staff is averaging $20 per hour",

The cafe was walking distance to the Diamondback's game, so we swung back by after the game for more drinks and food. Atmosphere is casual and the place smells wonderful (like fresh vegetables, and wood smoked chicken...Yummo!). I love all the local merchandize for sale, and even bought one of their aprons.

My better half and I would look forward to walking to the cafe for dinner at least one night a week.  Within the past two months, we have noticed an increased staff turnover, poor food quality and terrible customer service.  Prices have increased with portions shrinking (3 ounces of salmon is standard for the dinner plate), new servers are absent and rude at best, and expect to wait 45 minutes for your meal after placing your order.  With the recently added tables in the dining room, it's as though they chose quantity over quality.  At our last visit to to the cafe, these sentiments were shared with other guests as we saw lots of meals being sent back to the kitchen and the manager making the rounds to dispute complaints from patrons for extended waiting times, cold food and wrong orders.  Very disappointed.  Don't waste your time or money here.",

    "text": "We stopped here for the first time last Friday evening around 6:30 p.m. with a few of my co-workers, and we all ordered something different so between the five of us got a pretty good range of tastes from their menu.  First off, the food was very good.  We started off with the Downtown Devil Fries and the Chips, Salsa & Guacamole, all of which vanished almost instantly.  I had the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie.  I couldn't tell if the pies are made in advance and frozen or made to order (what threw me was that they are served in small foil pans much like the frozen pot pies you buy at Safeway), but the crust was outstanding, as was the filling.  No complaints about cold food here, as the pot pie was still VERY warm 20 minutes after I was served!  My partner had the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich, which he enjoyed.  However, he tends to prefer a creamy cole slaw rather than the dressing PPMC uses, which I believe is vinaigrette-based.  The only real surprise of the evening was more of a presentation issue than a taste issue.  One member of our party ordered the Roasted Cauliflower entree, which comes with mashed potatoes.  The mashed potatoes were very good and the cauliflower was nicely cooked, but rather than serving the florets or even somewhat larger bite-sized pieces, what ended up on her plate looked like someone had cut a head of cauliflower into thirds and cooked and served it that way.  Luckily she had a knife, but this meant, of course, that a good deal of what she was served was cauliflower stems, which although I do like the vegetable is not my favorite part.  Finally, as I am new to Arizona I don't know if anything can be done about  the flies, which may just be a seasonal annoyance due to the rain, but I think we'll sit inside next time we come back to try breakfast here.",

Fruit is fresh and tasty with a good balance of yogurt and granola. The oatmeal risotto needs a bit more flavor.  A little too bland for my liking. I can't place my finger on it but the coffee section is a disconnect for me.  Order food at the front, go stand on the other side of restaurant for your coffee. The coffee is fabulous.  The staff is friendly but some appear to be very overwhelmed but that's the growing pains of a new restaurant no matter where and no matter how long the owner has been in business.  I like it and will continue to come back.  I love the small retail section and I always buy something from that area.  It's all made locally.",

In my case, after waiting 28 minutes for poached eggs, I went up to the counter to ask where my order was. I was asked to wait a few more minutes, so I questioned whether my order was even started (these are poached eggs after all).  My question was met with lots of attitude from Nicole, who was unapologetic and informed me that it \"takes time\" to sautee the vegetables (spinach LOL) that come with my eggs.  A little dumbfounded, I waited for an apology, a gesture of regret, an attempt to make it right, but that's apparently beyond the customer service capabilities of this place. So I requested my money back, went home, and had eggs ready in 90 seconds.",

Honestly this was some of the worst food I've had in a long time and I am not a picky eater. I ordered the pulled pork sandwich which was floating in some pretty tasteless bbq sauce and there was at least 25% of large pieces of fat mixed in there.  With a price of $10.50 I expected a decent size sandwich but but what I got was a medium size hamburger bun that had barely any pork on it and loads of fat. Very disappointing, so I sent it back and ordered a grilled cheese sandwich.  It was totally tasteless and also very skimpy. Be real now. How do you ruin a grilled cheese sandwich?    Although it only cost $6.50 (which by the way they never even offered to refund me the price difference and I never bothered to mention it)  Any way please don't waste your money on that place it really was not a good experience and there are plenty of other really good places to eat in Phoenix.  Try the Deuce, also located in the down town area. Unique, great food and wonderful atmosphere.  We went there last week and totally enjoyed it",

    "text": "The atmosphere here is very nice, but a restaurant can't just survive on this alone.  When we arrived we were waiting in a line that was not moving.  Then an employee politely told us we could go to the bar and place our order.  My sister and cousin ordered a cup of soup with a salad and pretzel and a grilled cheese.  I placed my order separate for a pork chili verde pot pie.  My sisters soup arrived in a huge bowl.  She explained she ordered a cup.  The server told her it was the cup.  The server asked if we needed anything else my sister explained she ordered a salad and pretzel.  The server went to check on the items and came back and said the person who rang up our order must not have included the salad and pretzel as they were not on your receipt.  My sister explained no problem, she didn't think she could eat them anyway because the soup was so big.  A few minutes later a different person brings the pretzels to our table.  We all looked confused to say the least.  This server said they had already put the order in.  How could they put the order in if she was not charged?   We thought at this point they were just giving us the pretzel because it was already made.  The pretzel was OK but the sauce given to dip it in was awful and had not taste.  It just tasted like flour and water.  To our surprise another server  had charged my sisters credit card on a separate transaction without getting the card from her to do so, then hand carried the receipt to our table for her to sign it.  Very suspicious behavior for a business.   Now lets discuss the pork pot pie.  It was pricy and came out small, overcooked, and literally was dryer than a cotton ball.  There was no gravy inside.  On the way out, I waited in the front area to talk to a manager but the same gentleman working behind the bar did not have the situational awareness to see I was waiting.  I eventually just left.  Will not return.",

We sat for about 20 minutes, with multiple servers walking by saying hello, without being officially greeted.  We went up to the counter to inquire about service, and were told we had to order and pay BEFORE we sat down, then we were given a huge number on a stick to put at our table.  Where was the sign or greeter to tell us that?Don't you think all those friendly servers who said hi to us would have noticed we were looking around and that there was NO number at our table?!  After ordering 2 salads and a coconut curry soup, the food came out quickly, but without my dressing on the side.  Another trip to the counter... and also to inquire \"where were the drinks we ordered?\"  It was bad enough we had to fill our own water glasses at a station far away from our table.  The drinks were to be picked up at the bar.. At this point, I may as well have tipped my awesome date who did all the running around!  On the second visit, I brought my 2 children and a good friend.  Now that I knew the ordering drill, it went smoother.  However, my soup came out cold, the kids each ordered a grilled cheese and only 1/2 a sandwich came out on a huge plate for each of them,  and ... well, my friend spilled her drink on my lap.. Not the restaurant's fault...  The s'more cookies were awesome, but when I inquired if there were any gluten free pastries along side all of the vegan ones, the girl at the counter looked at me like I had 6 heads.. apparently only vegan is cool there, and they are gluten lovers ;) The ambiance is great and the remodeling is fantastic.  However, there are many kinks that need to be worked out and the servers need training asap.",

The meatloaf and mashed potatoes were delicious! The fried chicken and roasted cauliflower made it worth the trek down town and the burger was melt in your mouth good! Great service, awesome drinks, soulful live music and the chocolate cake was decadent!! We will definitely be frequenting this place!",

My co-workers and I were disgusted. They didn't seem to care and just brought out another one with a $5 gift card (thanks but that doesn't even cover half the cost of the sandwich I just ordered). It gets worse, the second sandwich had a huge chicken cartilage piece in it, I officially lost my appetite. I would not recommend eating here, if fact I will probably go out of my way to tell people to avoid this place at all costs.",

    "text": "I am a new fan of this place - really close to my apartment, and I love how it is adjacent to the farmer's market so you can be a part of the \"scene\" down there. I was sad to see the Public Market Grocery store go, but this restaurant has done an excellent job of keeping the integrity of the building intact. I may even like this remodel better than the old one. The exposed wood ceiling is beautiful. The patio is gorgeous. And the reclaimed wood tables and low-slung benches in the dining area make you want to sit down and stay awhile. There are free water spigots for regular and sparkling water, a nice touch,  However, I feel the food still has work to do. I was not very impressed with my egg sandwich at breakfast. I specifically asked if there was anything aside from guacamole, cheese, bacon and egg on the sandwich. The cashier replied \"No, nothing else\". Well, I get the sandwich and the guacamole has onions in it. I hate onions. Onions are my nemesis. So, I have to awkwardly and messily scrape all the guacamole off my sandwich and put it back together. Also, the cheese was not melted onto the sandwich. It was just cold, grated cheese atop the egg. I found that a bit odd.  If they can iron out the kinks with the food, which I have heard that they are trying to do (including adding new items to menu soon), then I think this place could be 5 stars.",

We were greeted by super-friendly servers and were instantly charmed by the decor and set-up. The dining room was full so we sat on the patio. We placed our order at the counter and didn't have to wait more than a few minutes for our drinks. I tried the Melon Mojito- YUM! Our food arrived rather promptly as well and my frittata was delicious as was my boyfriend's pulled pork sandwich. Great service, great food, cute atmosphere. I definitely recommend this place for brunch or lunch!",

Regrettably, once the food left the kitchen, it seemed like the staff did not know what to do with it. Several if our items just sat there waiting to be picked up. Items were missed and even though the staff was very courteous in making amends, the experience was ruined.",

I ordered the Evans Churchill which is quinoa with roasted veggies and two poached eggs on top. Everything was so good- the quinoa was perfectly cooked, the veggies were really fresh and nicely roasted, and the eggs were perfectly poached. It was served with pesto. It was a little under seasoned so had to put some salt and pepper on it, but overall loved the freshness of the dish.  I bought some cookies to go, the corn cookie and chocolate chip cookie, and a nutter butter. The corn cookie and chocolate chip cookie were both really good.  Next time, I want to try the Flarney Garney breakfast sandwich (my friend's favorite he said). My friend's chicken salad sandwich looked really good- perfectly toasted bread with a thick slice of watermelon served on the side.",

    "text": "This place was a fun little stop on our recent trip to Phoenix!   We came around lunch time, and the line was seriously backed out through the door - in the back of the restaurant. Craziness! But luckily, as we were waiting in line one of the bartenders offered us seats at the bar with no wait time.   My sis and I split a couple of the meals like we usually do; she got the veggie plate with dips and I got a salad with some sort of wheatberry or similar type of grain. The salad was good, with lots of yummy goat cheese. The veggie plate was lacking - we received a lot of spinach and not so many dippable veggies for the sauces. Still good, but maybe not worth almost $10. My hubs got some sort of bagel sandwich that was super tasty.  Service was nice and friendly, and at the end when we asked for our yelp check-in cookie, he went and got them for us without us having to wait through the line. Very nice! Also, that cornmeal cookie I got was the BOMB, and I've been dreaming about recreating it ever since.",

Although I was bummed because on our 3 day trip to Phoenix, I only had a limited number of eating opportunities and I saved one just for pot pie.   We ordered the porchetta sandwich,  a weekend special apparently, and the rice bowl. I had mixed feelings about the sandwich. The pork was very tasty and tender...but the ciabatta bread ruined it for me. Without sauce, there's no reason to use ciabatta. The bread is too tough for a dry sandwich.  The rice bowl was good, healthy and vibrant although overpriced for something you can make yourself. The peanut vinaigrette is really good though.  The food wasn't WOW enough for me to not feel cheated that I didn't go to one of my other bookmarked options",

    "text": "Phoenix Public Market Cafe Cartel Coffee Cinnamon Roll Strawberry Pop-Tart Apple Crumb Tart Corn Cookie Cowgirl Cookie Ballerina Cookie Peanut Butter Cookie Banana Bread  Part of the continuing rebirth of Downtown Phoenix, a hip 3-meal restaurant, bar, and bakery peddling fresh ingredients under the premise of \"Building Community Through Food,\" it was after perusing the various options offered at the open-air stalls outside that I entered Phoenix Public Market Cafe, the options running the gamut from healthy to truly gluttonous with service that couldn't have been more pleasant if it tried.  Offering seating options ranging from tables to booths to bars, unlimited Cartel Coffee available alongside local artisan products and menu items ranging Chickpea Pancakes and Ceviches to BBQ Pulled Pork and a \"Ballerina Cookie\" riddled with Espresso it should seem obvious to anyone standing in line that the baked goods are a source of pride for the cafe, all but the underflavored banana bread at the very least 'good' while several were far better.  Eventually settling on a half-dozen items - before glistening cinnamon rolls emerged from the kitchen and a social media check-in netted a free cookie - it was at the hightop bar juxtaposing one laden in top-shelf spirits that a seat was taken, a few passers-by chuckling at what surely appeared an  overzealous spread.  Not foolish enough to ignore effects of freshness, the cinnamon roll actually served with cream cheese frosting in a sidecar as the kitchen feared it was still too hot to top, those fancying a truly decadent pastry need look no further than this golden spiral of brioche and butter, the topping actually helping to tame sweetness without losing its smooth texture at all.  Taking a break in the sizable coil to refill coffee and try more things it was with banana bread cast aside that a tasting of four cookies commenced and with crispy rims encircling soft centers in each a \"best\" option really comes down to personal preferences, the Cowboy not dissimilar to the flavors of Trail Mix while the corn version tasted exceedingly natural, as did the Peanut Butter 'with a schmear.'  Always hopeful to see an artisan Pop-Tart compete with the cellophane-wrapped originals of days gone by it can only be said that the version offered at Phoenix Public Market Cafe is a very good Toaster Strudel, but still not the 'real deal,' the Apple Crumb Tart a far more worthwhile expenditure of cash and calories with an all butter crust chock-a-block full of apples and streusel overlying a liquid caramel core.",

They have delicious treats (macaroons, brownies, little cakes) in the front case that are always available. And if you check in on Yelp, they'll give you a free cookie with any purchase (I got the corn cookie)!   Their breakfast is served until 3pm, and it's always delicious. I love their chickpea pancakes!! Their ingredients are always fresh, and they serve an amazing mimosa.   For lunch or dinner, definitely try the BBQ Pulled Pork Sandwich. It is one of the best pulled pork sandwiches in town. They also have AMAZING starters, like the downtown devil fries, nachos, or pretzels.   I love coming here for happy hour after class/work with my friends as well. They have some great beer on tap as well as a kick-ass sangria.   Service is usually fast and friendly, and I love the vibe of this place. They have cute little items in the front you can buy, like local cook books or other goods, and they even serve Cartel coffee at the bar.   Don't miss this place!",

    "text": "First of all, I'm not reviewing because of customer service. The staff was actually really nice! No complaints here. The whole vibe & ambiance of the cafe is great as well. No negative thing to say. If you're looking for hipster, you've found it. I appreciate that they have outdoor seating. Plenty of seating actually. But it does get buku packed during lunch.   I'm more disappointed in the food. First off, if you purchase their chips & salsa, which runs you $7.25 for what you can get free at most Mexican restaurants, you're either an idiot or filthy rich. That's ridiculous. I can't even believe they offer that.   But on to what we actually ordered. My sister ordered the lentil soup. She said this tasted great. The portions however were disappointing. She ordered a large. But when she went to dip her spoon in, she hit the bottom of the bowl immediately. The soup barely went over half her spoon. The bowl was \"large\" in diameter but the depth...I mean can you call that depth?! Our friend ordered a side of lentil soup & we're willing to bet that it's the exact same size as my sister's large order. Only she paid $3 for a side.   I ordered the Roosevelt Row Bagel. It says it comes with chunky avocado. It's $9.25 but I thought, well, avocados are expensive so this is somewhat reasonable. Especially if the avocado is chunky. Tell me why they spread my avocado like we're in the great depression! Why can I see the bagel through my \"chunky\" avocado?! & why are they calling it chunky avocado when in fact the chunks were not avocadoes, they were bell peppers!   My friend also ordered the same bagel but she couldn't get over the fact that the sprouts they came with were like ten pieces. & on top of that the hummus was salty. Hummus salty? Yes, it's possible, their hummus was salty. & you know the grapes & oranges they add on the plate? This we could not stop laughing at. How they thought four or three pieces of grape were going to suffice was beyond me. I was dying. Then I looked at my orange & saw that they basically gave me a peal! I lost it. At that point you can't help but laugh. The rest of lunch just became a roast at everything everyone else ordered. We'll give it to their chicken curry sandwich though, it was pretty darn tasty.  Look, if you come here for the ambiance or a place to study, I don't blame you. It's a cool place. But if you come here for the food, you must be out your gat damn mind. This must be the closest place to you for lunch if that's what you think. Happy hour, no questions. But full priced? Come on now.",

I ordered the fried chicken. And mashed potatoes with broccoli.  The meal starts with a small salad of mixed greens.    She had the spaghetti and meatballs. We both had left overs and left happy and full, cookies in tow.    On the second trip we noticed that there was no special menu available. But we knew the food was good so we didn't mind. Both times we checked In for the free cookie.  The chocolate chip was almost all chocolate and barely any cookie.  Just perfect for a chocoholic like my self.",

    "text": "Phoenix Public Market use to be my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. The service was prompt, the food was AMAZING and the expiernce was lovely.  Over my last 3 visits to the Market Cafe, I have been thoroughly disappointed and will not be returning for the foreseeable future.   Let's start with the food.  I pretty much always get the southwestern chicken pasta, as it is by far my favorite. On one of my visits, I told them my order and they informed me they were out of chicken. I was shocked to say the least, as most of their menu has chicken in it. When I asked if I could still have the pasta, and if it would be any cheaper, they declined. I asked about veggies being added in, and the employee said all they could do was broccoli. When I received my dish, there looked to be two pieces of broccoli.   Today, I went back in with a group of friends excited to show them the Market Cafe. I went up, and told them my order. Guess what? They were out of pasta....among a long list of other things. I again, was pretty irritated. I ordered the Rice veggie bowl and added chicken, it was alright, but not really what I wanted or expected.  I find it pretty disheartening that every tine I come to the restaurant, there's ingredients missing for the dishes. Mind you, I don't come late at night, but about half an hour into the dinner menu. So it makes 0 sense to me why they just wouldn't things available. Not to mention, the employees do not adjust pricing or offer substitute unless prompted.   The service is also lacking, majorly. When you order a dessert at the counter, they ALWAYS forget to give it to you. Even when they bring your main dish, they will not bring it unless you mention you ordered it. I've even been questioned by employees before if I \"paid for it\". None of the employees seem to know what's going on, which is unfortunate.  Overall, this restaurant is turning into a dysfunctional establishment that I will not be returning to in the near future. If you loved PHX public market like me-be aware there's another location in Tempe that has way better service and always has ingredients!",

    "text": "Phoenix Public Market is a fun place to hang out. It's got something for everyone: healthy food, comfort food, beer, cocktails, coffee, cookies, you name it. The food is always really good. I particularly like their salmon, and they have granola and fresh fruit, too. The only thing I don't like is that it's hard to find a seat, and they don't always have the fireplace going outside even when it's pretty chilly. If you're there to study, good luck finding a working outlet. But they do have student discounts and on Sundays and Mondays there's a three-course meal for only $12.99. You get a salad, your choice of entrees, and a dessert--and there are $5 and $7 drink specials.",

    "text": "Edit: forgot one thing. My mom's sandwich was more bread than anything else. Found out later that the guy making drinks at the bar was bringing everyone else their drinks (to their table) but made my mom come and pick hers up from the bar. Now I'm not sure why but being that she is the only Asian lady in the entire restaurant am I not allowed to think this was why? I won't judge because I can't know every side but this is how it looked. -1 more star (from three to two). Sad since the food was so good :(   Came up on this place during my visit here in Phoenix. Let's start with the bad, and get to the good (which thankfully for them outweighs the bad)   Cons: since it was my first time here I was lost and confused about pretty much everything. Cashier was no help, and didn't answer us (just stared blankly) when we asked questions. Or maybe she didn't hear us because the music is way too loud. I ordered a prickly pear iced tea and she rung it up. It never came out from the bar so I went up to ask, and it turns out that it's self serve. Would have liked to know that sooner. Then soon after I couldn't find it because (shocking) it's not labeled prickly pear-- it's labeled HERBAL. Why? I don't know. Would have liked to know that too but it took me a few rounds of questions to get that out of the worker at the register. I was already irked so I just got myself regular iced tea and sat down.   Okay now for the pros:  Absolutely adorable decor  as soon as I walked in I was in love. The food was amazing, I had the AZ Burger and I loved it. The bun was soft and not dry. The patty was juicy and cooked to perfection. The green chile in the burger was a delicious addition. House dressing added a nice zing. Pretty plating is also a plus. Everyone in my party loved their food as well.  If you want to come here and haven't been before, be prepared to go in blind and without assistance from employees because they probably can't hear you. Otherwise, it's a great cafe with absolutely amazing food.  if I come back again I'll probably have a better time because it'll be more familiar ",

The only downside is that many of the silverware in the jar were missing forks which means people are still touching it and then putting back what they don't need and the staff isn't removing that touched silverware. I would prefer it at the counter where you order or by the drinks.   We ordered the pancake which we have never tried. It was different but in a good way. Tasted like a sweeter cornbread, make sure you ask for a side of honey. It was thick and warm and just perfect (very filling as it is only one but takes up the entire plate and probably is 1/2 in thick.   Also got the rooster booster. I've had it a lot and it tastes just as good as it always does.   The restaurant and bathrooms were clean. They have also done away with straws but they do have some for to go cups. I still love all the decor and the environment. The parking was very limited as the back lot didn't appear to be open and the lot attached to the building was full.",

    "text": "We stopped in for a bite before around 10:30 before we had to leave for the airport so we were able to get something from the breakfast menu as well as the \"all day\" lunch menu (which is confusingly *not* all day, but from 11-close).   Food: For breakfast, we got the breakfast burrito. The tortilla was nice and chewy, filled with eggs and pieces of bacon. The eggs were nice and firm scrambled, and the bacon, though soft from being steamed by the eggs, still stood out well and added the needed saltiness to the food. Make sure to add a bit of salsa to each bite! There's also a slice of watermelon that comes with the dish.  For lunch, we got the corn bisque. I think this is not a normal menu item, so it might not be available all the time. It had a nice hearty consistency, and good corn flavor. It would be even better to spice it up with some hot sauce, but there's a smattering of chopped chile peppers (poblano, I believe) centered in the dish. These provided a nice amount of heat for each bite, but could be avoided if you're not a fan of the spicy.   We also got some coffees: Cold brew and a decaf drip. The cold brew was on the bright side. The decaf drip unfortunately was at the bottom of the pot (and the creamer ran out at the same time!), so I asked if I could switch my order to a cappucino. There was a small price difference, but they took care of it because the decaf had run out. Good service!  Ambiance: It's kind of a cross between coffee shop and hip diner. Sound level is a bit higher than a coffee shop too. I saw people with laptops, but didn't see any dedicated remote workers (it was a holiday after all)",

I had the chicken salad sandwich with fries and he had a pasta dish.  For dessert, we shared one of the pop tart pastries.  The pop tart was so good! I can hardly wait to go back.  We're going to try their breakfast this weekend.  I wish I had discovered this place sooner! The only con was paying $6 for parking.

    "text": "I have eaten here twice. One time was takeout and once eat in, brunch on a Sunday.   The layout is terrible. It is extremely difficult for anyone to move around, and there is not enough seating for the number of patrons. With the way the line wraps around the restaurant, it goes between one line of bar seating and one line of tabletop seating. Essentially 3 rows of people extremely close to each other, while other people (including staff) are attempting to walk through. This results in people backing into each other or pushing each other since there is no room to move.   The posted menus are impossible to read from any distance, so be sure to grab a menu and have someone to hold your spot if you want to look at the specials.   While the food I have had each time has been mediocre, my biggest gripe is that I got horrible food poisoning the last time I ate there. I ordered a breakfast burrito, and the tortilla was raw in some places, and the bacon was not fully cooked. I got sick immediately after consuming it, and had the worst food poisoning of my life for 2 days after that. I was so sick and in so much pain that I was unable to sleep for over 48 hours after the meal. I would have considered coming here again aside from the food poisoning, but I will never return and I will be sure to warn anyone I know.",

We had already eaten breakfast but we stopped in the Cafe to get a cold brew coffee and Americano. It was the morning rush so it was pretty busy, but that is to be expected.  Everything on the menu sounded delicious, so we came back in the afternoon for a late lunch, around 1:30. It was less busy than the morning, but you can tell it's a popular place! I ordered the kale salad (kale, beets, pomegranate seeds, cranberries, radishes, carrots, goat cheese) - everything so fresh and flavorful - worth $11!  Philip got the Tito's Cubano sandwich (rotisserie pork, ham, swiss, pickles, dijon) and he loved it. Great flavors and not too heavy (didn't leave him feeling like he needed a nap). Also they cut it into 3 pieces which made it easier to eat. There were so many things on the menu I'd love to try. It's a little pricey (sandwiches and salads range from $9-13) but worth it. They use fresh, local ingredients and the quality is over the top.  The open design of this place is very cool. There is indoor and outdoor seating, bar seating, high top/shared table seating. The time it took after ordering to get our food seemed a little slow - maybe because it was a busy weekend or maybe it's always a little slow. Either way, we weren't in a hurry & it was nice to take our time. Probably not the best option if you are looking for a fast meal.  I'd definitely recommend this Cafe, as well as the open air Public Market itself on Saturday morning!",

I ordered the blue corn pancake and it was delicious! I was a little apprehensive about the combo but decided to be adventurous and I'm glad I did. It was a little pricey ($10 something I think) but very substantial - I couldn't even finish it. I also got an iced mocha latte which was fabulous.

They had a pitcher for beer for $5 bucks and bartender was telling me that they partner with a brewery in New York that makes a specialty brew just for them. It was pretty good and for the size it was definitely worth $5. My wife got one of their happy hour cocktails and she enjoyed it. This is just a nice overall spot to hang out in downtown Phoenix. They have food, coffee, beer, cocktails, and a small little retail space. I still have yet to eat here but that will most likely what I come here next for.",

    "text": "Last night, we celebrated one of my closest friend's birthdays out on the patio. I think our group ended up being around 11 people or so. Our waitress, Gabby, had the most cheerful and positive disposition ever! We were so grateful that she was able to accommodate our large group and even be our photographer at the end of dinner because those are definitely two annoying things that large groups can be! To make things worse, we had split checks and since couples sat across from each other, it made things even more confusing and she still was super patient with us and so very sweet!  As far as the food goes, the fried chicken was delightful! Each bite of meat was tender and moist and full of flavor. The fried breading part was what had my heart skipping a beat. It had the texture of typical home cooked thick fried chicken would feel like but it tasted like I was eating a homemade biscuit - flaky and scrumptious. The entree dish was large with the greens and mashed potatoes so I had trouble eating everything, but my friends who were on vegan diets at the time were cheering me on to finish every bite. They were telling me that I missed a spot here or there because they admitted they were envious they didn't take a break from their diet and order the fried chicken as well. It was hilarious!   The happy hour was great too! I tried the Lee Trevino and it was refreshing but had a great spicy kick to it. At the end of dinner, they did a made-to-order iced coffee with whiskey and it was a great dessert substitute for me and helped me stay energetic for the rest of the birthday shenanigans. I really like this place a lot!",

Bacon wasn't crisp as I had requested but was still delicious. Nachos were really good.   It was hopping and very busy on a Sunday at lunchtime so we sat on the patio on a cloudy damp day but the fireplace was going and there was a heater so it was still pretty nice.  It's a nice touch to give a free cookie when you check in on yelp and we were excited. None of us were super crazy about the cookies though. We had ballerina and chocolate chunk. Consensus was that we like soft chewy cookies and these weren't. The ballerina cookie tasted like health food... Someone described it as bird seed.",

It was actually our first meal in Phoenix as we met up with some friends (who'd never eaten here either) soon after touch-down. All in all, while not gross or \"bad\" it was our leas favorite meal in Phoenix and close to the most expensive esp. when quality/quantity are factored into the cost. We got here after the lunch rush, not to busy. However, it took about an hour to get our food after order. Not sure what happened there. I went with a quiche. It had eggs, spinach, etc. and it was pretty good--but not great. It was also an incredibly tiny slice, particularly for $14. It came with a pretty good arugula salad. I added a side of bacon which while looking crispy was incredibly chewy. The fruit tea was good. My wife had a grilled cheese...which was okay but which was almost burnt. Her fries were good/okay. Her drink (w/ vodka and basil, etc.) was really tasty but pretty weak in the alcohol content. Our three dining companions all liked their food just fine but for the price none of us were really satisfied. On the plus side, the free cookie with a check in was a plus as it was a truly tasty cookie.",

I got an egg dish for breakfast and as far as I remember it was decent but not spectacular, certainly not memorable. This weekend I came for lunch because I heard they had a pretty good pork chili verde pot pie. I'm pretty much a pot pie fanatic so I had to try it. I found the pie to be a good size. These things are pretty deceptive though because they look so small but they're incredibly dense and filling. The pie was stuffed with generous chucks of delicious pork in a chili verde sauce (as you'd expect) but the crust was not flaky enough in my opinion. In fact, the crust was so stiff I couldn't even cut into the pie. I thought perhaps it was just a one off sort of thing but my parents also got the pot pie and had a similar complaint.   There's a lot of great food in downtown Phoenix and I do like the ambience of Phoenix Public Market but the food just doesn't hold up terrifically.",

    "text": "Community Night is the way to go here! 3 course dinner for $12.99? Can't beat that! The service is spot on. The food is oh so good! My friend recommended this place and as soon as everyone took their first bite and put their forks down, we were already raving about it...and asking if we could come back again tomorrow. If you were sitting at a nearby table and you heard us, you'd think we hadn't had a meal in weeks. It's that good!!  5 stars - Roasted Cauliflower with mashed potatoes and arugula salad. This roasted cauliflower is the best preparation I've had of this dish. Perfectly seasoned and roasted with the exact doneness you want. It's got the smoky crisp edges and it's cooked tender throughout. Cut a piece of it and dip it in some of the chili aioli that comes with it! The mashed potatoes was the thicker creamy type and well seasoned. The arugula salad was a light addition to round out the entree.   5 stars - Soft serve ice cream. This one is sourced locally. Love that! This is the dessert part of the 3 courses, and you get a choice of vanilla or chocolate. Or you can get one of their jarred desserts. They were so nice and let me try the chocolate and vanilla. This soft serve had a nice natural taste to it with a pleasing finish on the palate. The chocolate wasn't too sweet and had bits of dark chocolate in it. The vanilla though. My favorite for sure! Perfect sweetness.   5 stars - Color changing spoons. That's right. I'm writing about this. Get the ice cream and you get a pink spoon with it. But then after eating your first spoonful of ice cream you notice the pink spoon is now purple. How cool is that? The cold temperature changes the spoon to a different color! Our table really got a kick out of this. Ah yes, the sound of friends laughing together. What a sweet sound. This is such a creative touch that I really appreciate. It just sealed the deal for me!  This is so my kinda restaurant. If I lived nearby I'd eat here every week, where the ambience is cool, the servers treat you like friends, and the food is flavorful and high quality! Hmmm...what should I order tomorrow when I come back?",

HH includes $5 pitchers of beer and $5 cocktails.    Last night was the first time I had dinner at the Cafe.  Normally when I come it is either for HH or for breakfast.  Well I had the Rachel sandwich that had coleslaw, sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, house dressing, melted on sourdough. WOW, that sandwich was amazing.  I'm glad I finally had dinner here.  I definitely be coming back to try something different.  Also my favorite cocktail drink is the Lee Trevino and my favorite breakfast item is The Rooster Booster.    If you have not been to the Phoenix Public Market Cafe you are totally missing out.  So, when you are in the downtown area and wanting something to eat or drink.  You should totally come here.",

Had breakfast and lunch there on different days (frittata, pulled pork sandwich and az burger, spicy fruits, sweet potatoes) and all were delicious! There's always an interesting daily or weekly special.   Know that this is not a full service restaurant (you need to place your order at the counter and they bring your food afterwards)... The staff are very helpful and courteous and there are many options for all types of appetites including good coffee and drinks!   If you are downtown Phoenix, I would definitely recommend this place to eat! And on Thursdays, the open air market right next door is opened from 5-9 pm (Saturday hours vary).",

We got a lavender (color, not flavor) macaron. It was exquisitely tasty.  We arrived here after walking around downtown, catching a movie and a 10 minute debate over where to have dinner, since one of us was famished and the other...peckish.   Off in the near distance we see a bright red sign beckoning us to come hither...the sign read (NO! not literally, that would be impressive, but we will probably never fully know or comprehend the literacy of the sign) \"CAFE\".

I ordered the \"Eat the Rainbow\" salad, which is described as marinated, steamed, and raw veggies with dipping sauces. I expected a more cohesive salad, but it was more like a plate of crudites than a salad. Best part of the dish was the curry aioli. Definitely not worth $9.  However, my friend got the Evans-Churchill, and it looked amazing! Some of the other dishes looked really appetizing as well, so maybe I just tried the wrong thing.   It can get crowded on a weekday lunch, but they bring the food out fast and people don't loiter too long.",

The burger was incredibly delicious with a great kick of heat from the peppers on top. The BBQ was delicious and very well balanced. We also split an order of the fries that were out of bounds.  This is a great place to go for a date, take friends from out of town, or get a meal where the chef clearly cares about what they serve. If you are in Phoenix and haven't tried this place yet do yourself a favor and check it out. We can't wait to get back and try more things on the menu, because all the baked goods look amazing.  5 stars well earned!",

Like a real weirdo, I'd stare directly into your eyes as you bite into a juicy burger, making you feel self conscious for no reason.   Kidding, I'd be too busy biting into my own delicious piece of rotisserie chicken. Speaking of chicken, that wood roasting method is perfection. It kind of ruins the ol' Sprouts chicken that sits under warming lights waiting patiently for me on lazy nights. Way to ruin a perfectly good relationship built on convenience, PHX Public Market.   Now let us have a little discussion about vegetables. Do steamed veggies make anyone else angry? Like, what is this crap? Seriously, this isn't the 1950s. Nothing is more sad than a boring-ass steamed vegetable. I'd rather just eat it raw. It's even worse when someone tosses it in some kind of fat. So let me get this straight, you are going to cook that broccoli in the healthiest manner possible and then you're going to cover it in fat that doesn't actually make it taste better? I just don't get this method of preparation and I never will. There are plenty of healthy and infinitely more delicious ways to serve a vegetable. Why does this abomination still exist? When is it not disappointing to see this side dish on your plate? Be honest. Have you ever been excited for a steamed vegetable? (If the answer is yes, you are either my grandma or so white bread it hurts.) I wanna put out a PSA on all the other healthy alternatives to steaming a veg. Seriously, it doesn't have to be this sad.   Aside from the lack of inventive vegetable sides, it was a lovely night.",

We tried the macarons and they were yummy.  At 2.00 a piece, I am not sure how great that price is but it was fun to try them. Atmosphere is cool, casual and comfy with friendly staff.

The pulled pork sandwich is slightly better than average for what you can get out of pulled pork in Phoenix. Anyways, the food gets four stars.  As far as the service, they get two stars. I have never had my food come out before my drinks. It's as if the server forgot that she put in the drink order and never went to grab them from the service bar. When our food runner brought the food out, we asked her about the drinks and she went to check. She brought back the wine and beer. I could tell they had been sitting there because my chilled glass had so much condensation that I had to pour out water from the bottom of it. On top of that, the server never acknowledged the oversight. I get mistakes and oversights happen, but please, just apologize for them and I'm over it.",

    "text": "Love the vibe here, but the food was a little disappointing.    This used to be the old Public Market Grocery Store, but after the store closed, the owners of St Francis restored it as an all day cafe serving farm to table foods.  The concept is great and the restaurant itself has a great neighborhood feel to it.  I went here with a date for dinner on a Tuesday and the place was way busier than we expected.  They have a great patio in back so we sat out there and people watched.    I ordered the grilled cheese.  One question.  Where was the cheese?  The bread was very hearty, but I could barely taste a lick of the white cheddar in there.  Also got a glass of Cabernet Sauvignon and it was super cold.  I understand it's hard to keep wine at the right temperature during Phoenix summers, but they didn't need to refrigerate it that much.  My date got the Caesar salad and generally liked it.  She LOVED the Farmer's Cup cocktail.  I was tempted to grab one their displayed pastries, but took a pass this time around.    I'll be back to try again (probably for breakfast instead), but I hope they step up their game a bit next time.  The setting of the restaurant and the freshness of the ingredients are such that they should be able to make this concept work.",

It's not a huge one on Wednesday but it is decent. We've eaten here a number of times and it's always phenomenonal.   Tonight I got 1/2 the rotisserie chicken with veggies and baked sweet potatoes. My fiance got the lumberjack burger. We also ordered the pretzel bread appetizer but they ran out (our waitress apologized and said that a handful are made for the day) we got the chips and salsa. My fiance got the prickly pear tea and I got the sangria. The prickly pear tea was great, it isn't sweeten but they have splenda. The sangria had apples in it, it wasn't the best I've had but wasn't bad. The chips were freshly made, I should know,  I got greedy and threw one in my mouth and burnt my tongue haha! My chicken was moist and flavorful. You know sometimes when you get chicken and it isn't well seasoned and taste bland? That's not what you get here. Everything was fresh. I had a bit of the burger which they cooked perfectly, cheese was still melty when they brought it out. The ambience was very nice. Relaxed, easy, good food, lots of laugher.  They also do community seating, which if you're down to make new friends, is great. I come back time and time again never disappointed. ( I usually come twice a month on Wednesdays)",

I had the \"eat the rainbow\" which was literally that. Rainbow colored veggies over a bowl of lemony greens with three different homemade dipping sauces - pesto, ginger, and some kind of yellow ranch tasting sauce. The veggies were crisp and fresh and the dish was filling - lots of different colored cauliflower, broccoli, and baby squash. I really enjoyed all the colors visually too. My boyfriend had the fried chicken which was moist yet not greasy and the sides of mashed potatoes and kale salad complimented really well. It looked so good I had to steal a bite. Try the Lee Trevino cocktail! It's got a unique flavor and a surprising kick from the habanero. Can't wait to explore this place for breakfast and lunch.",

    "text": "I think this is a very cool little restaurant. I had the veggie bowl and although some reviews said it didn't have much taste I thought it was good. All fresh veggies and a small amount of brown rice on the bottom. The dressing was really good and gave the salad a great spicy taste. It is what it is...fresh veggies, broccoli, carrots, mushrooms, etc taste like they taste, you can't really change that. I think the reviews saying it was tasteless were kinda unfounded, you can't give veggies an extra taste unless you are cooking them in a sauce. My friend had the half chicken dish with cole slaw and a sweet potato with a good lime butter. She really enjoyed it. We both waited a little for happy hour and had the Chardonnay which was locally \"brewed\" and very good. I checked in with yelp and got the free cookie (cowboy) which was so good that I bought some other cookies to take home. I wanted to try the devil fries but actually was full enough on my food to not waste the calories! I will come back and try them. I love that it is also pet friendly on the outside seating area. The place is decorated very nice and has an inviting and warm ambiance.",

The food is also very yummy, although the portion sizes may seem a little small.  The sweet treats blow my hair back each time. Today, I got the fresh banana bread and almost scarfed down the whole piece while waiting for the light rail. I did not; I have to watch my girlish figure.  Since I am always here for alcoholic beverages and food, I did not know that they do not give cup discounts on their coffee like several other local and chain coffee shops do. I always have my Starbucks tin mug that normally gets me .50-80 cents off, which can add up to a nice savings over time.  Well, they do not do that here and, the coffee was disgusting. I am a former barista and have traveled around the world and Phoenix/Tempe sipping coffee with my pinky finger raised, and this cup of coffee did not blow my hair back.   Note to self: Never get a plain cup of coffee here, only delectable alcoholic beverages, food, and sweet treats.",

It was a last minute decision to go over another place we had planned for, but I am super glad we ended up there :)   I love how cute the restaurant is, the service was quick, and the food was delicious! My fiance had the BBQ Pulled Pork, my sister had the Chicken Quesadilla, and her boyfriend had the Tito's Cubano. I had the Chicken Salad Sandwich and fries, and we all shared the House Pretzels. Everything was amazing - the only thing I didn't try personally was the Cubano, but those who had some said it was amazing.   We also got some free Chocolate Chip Cookies for checking in ;) those were so good, too!   I definitely can't wait to go back to this spot and try more of the menu options - I'm really interested in trying their breakfast since everything else was so good. I also want to check out more of the local goods they sell at the front, so cute that they have that!   Definitely recommend going here if you're in the area! :)",

Over the years we have tried almost everything on the menu and have narrowed down our favorites, but you truly could order anything and be perfectly satisfied with your meal! Portions are large and the food is flavorful!  Our meal tonight included some of our favorites: The Fried Chicken - ALL TIME FAVE Prime Tri Tip - I swapped the mashed potatoes for the baked sweet potato and OH MAN that chili lime butter!!! It elevated the potato and I will definitely order it again  Italian Porchetta - Full of spice and a HUGE portion Pot Pie - My dad's absolute favorite item on the menu! Flaky crust, flavor-packed filling that's not too soupy  Don't forget to Check In on Yelp to get a free cookie! I LOVE the Ballerina Cookie, it's full of chocolate and cashews and coconut! The Vegan Apricot cookie is also delicious and moist, not crumbly at all like many vegan cookies are! ASU students also get 20% off an entree if you show a student ID, so I always try to remember to bring mine so I can take advantage of this deal!",

Food: I ordered the bbq pulled pork sandwich, which came with some fruit and a pickle, which I don't really eat.  BBQ pulled pork was actually pretty delicious, especially for brunch time. Lots of flavor and juicy bbq goodness with every bite. The sandwich is not that big, but It'll do for a brunch size fulfillment. You won't go into a food coma and will still be able to do things afterward.   Would defiantly not mine getting this again. However, price is on the pricey side of $10.50 + tax.   The inside of the building has a pretty modern and rustic environment. They do sell some phx souvenirs and the candles smelled good, but was also expensive for a tiny jar.   They have a big menu as well, so  a good brunch place for different tastes. Will need to try the one closer to me around Chandler.  Good hangout spot for groups.   Service was quick. waiters are friendly.",

Being that I am located on the ASU downtown campus for school, the Phoenix Public Market is so conveniently located and my go-to spot when I need a healthy bite to eat in between classes. Every meal I have gotten whether breakfast or lunch has been delicious and always makes me feel  energized for the rest of the day.   One recommendation I have is getting the breakfast burrito. This was the first menu item I tried and their tortilla is what really sold me on it. The tortilla is homemade and will leave you so happy after eating it! I also really love their \"Devil mess\" which is something I often order for breakfast as well. The Devil Mess offers a scramble which is the perfect portion sized and gets you energized for the day ahead.   For lunch I always order the bowls that they offer. They have two different types however I always order the bean and feta cheese bowl which is such a hearty meal to get me through the afternoon. My mom has also gotten the rotisserie chicken which is a specialty of theirs and really enjoyed it as well.   A tip I would add is spending the extra $1.50/2 and getting an iced tea. I am huge on finding yummy ice tea places and am never disappointed with their selection! Overall they have a loyal customer in me and am already planning a time I can go back in between class!",

If you want drinks from the bar you order them at the main counter and then they bring you round one.  Round two is at the bar or go back to the counter.   That ordering method is what's the weirdest thing about the place. Other than that the food was very good and the place smelled amazing  with a fireplace and smoked chicken in the kitchen.  We went at noon and breakfast could still be served.  I had the roasted pork Cuban (pickles on the side because I'm not a fan of them).  The sandwich was crusty and hot.  The cheesy goodness was running out the sandwich when you picked up the slices.  It was delicious.  The dipping sauce was a perfect accompaniment ... I used it all.  I certainly had my daily dose of mayo that day.  The fries are covered in garlic Parmesan and have 3 different sauces (more mayo) to use.   I preferred the spiciest.  My wife's roasted chicken was good and slightly smoky.  I think it was mesquite wood but the sign said hickory.   The garlic mash didn't have enough garlic but the purple slaw was good.   I had a red sangria and it was delicious.   They have their drinks down pat.      On the weekend the parking lot is full with local people selling their wares.   Highly recommend",

Anyhow, my niece requested to have lunch at this sweet spot. Thankfully we went when we did because it got crowded pretty quickly. I ordered the breakfast frittata which consisted of eggs, veggies from the farmers market(that squash was sooooo fresh and cooked perfectly), cheddar cheese, arugula, pesto and toast. My niece ordered the kid dish which was eggs, potatoes and toast minus bacon that comes with it. Everything was cooked perfectly and tasted well. The prices here are super reasonable! I love that they have a toy box for kids. This is super convenient when they're waiting for their food. Don't forget to check in on your yelp app and you get a free cookie. Actually I'd forgotten to get my cookie when we ordered so we stood in line on the way out. The line was pretty long so they gave us an extra cookie for waiting. Overall great vibes!!!",

The food came out very quickly. The chorizo gravy is delicious and the eggs came out perfectly. I would have preferred a flakier biscuit, but I expect that a flakier biscuit have gotten mushy quickly.  The prices are very good as well - $14 for breakfast, coffee, and a water. I'm from out of town but, if I lived here, I would definitely be back.",

The friend chicken was crispy and tendor. It was seriously surprisingly good.  To finish the meal, each of us also ordered a few macarons! The peanut butter, the caramel latte and dark chocolate were amazing. Not bad spending a few hours there drinking a Sangria and talking and listening to the live music. It was really chill.",

There is not a lot of room near the counters, where you place your order and then find a place to sit.  So, people mill around guessing who is next.  Once you place your order, the real challenge begins, trying to find a place to sit.  We had to hover around tables like vultures until someone got up. We then had to sit at a dirty table.  The server who dropped our food off, never picked up the old dirty dishes that we pushed aside, that were obviously not ours. We had to ask for her to come back and take them.  Another server came by and took our silverware and napkins off our table as we were sitting there waiting for our food, and gave them to someone else.  So, when our food was delivered, we had to ask and wait to get utensils.  The food was spendy and the portions small.  It is also very loud, so if you want to have a conversation, you will be talking loudly and cocking your ear to hear your company.  All told, we would most likely not be back. They need a more organized system.",

The bartender, I didn't catch her name, was funny, friendly, extremely knowledgable, and honestly made the entire experience; whoever she is deserves a crown for being such a queen.  She made me a custom cocktail using their ginger blueberry lemonade and tequila (who cares what else was in there, can I get an amen?) and as I was unsuccessfully deciding on what kind of dessert to get, she recommended some of the new soft serve ice cream.  This. Is. The. Softest. Servyest. Ice. Cream. Of. All. Time.   Eating this was, without a doubt, a spiritual-culinary event. I heard Anthony Bourdain's spirit come floating down from the ether, subtly insulting all other ice creams to have come before this one. No more of that Ben and Jerrys garbage, a vile and sorry excuse for Gods favorite frozen dessert, give me PPMC's ice cream or give me death. This stuff is better than the entire working relationship between George Clooney and Sandra Bullock, which I would like to watch in chronological order, back to back, while gorging on this soft serve.   Anyway, after I had climbed down the Holy Ladder of Sweet Tooth, Queen Bae Bartender hooked it up with a cold brew (delicious and effective) and I skid-addled resting atop the sugary cloud 9 I was just placed on.   Then I remembered I'm lactose-intolerant.",

Living downtown, the cafe is a hub and I am always trying to decide what fresh dish I'd like to taste next. I often see people studying the menu like it's a math book, because the meals are so hard to choose from! I personally have tried their pot pie, iced lattes, and homemade macaroons and they're all delicious! Most recently I came in on a cheat day to try their Cafe Sundae. What appealed to me the most was their use of local flavors, from the prickly pear caramel to the almond crumbs and honeycomb, too. It was constructed to be a dessert experience, and I loved it for its creativity and fusion of flavors. One of the staff members even told me she has dreams about it!

Don't think just order this asap. It was delicious and oh so pretty!!! Plus we weren't that hungry but between two women this was a solid amount of food. The wine we sampled was the house white, perfect choice for a warm day. We will definitely be back.   I would give this place 5 stars if it weren't for the loud music. It was middle of the day Saturday. The restaurant was fairly full and if it weren't for sitting next to the wall we would have had to yell at each other to hear/be heard. Not sure why places think music has to be so loud to be an enjoyable atmosphere.   Check in on Yelp and you can get a free cookie.

However, once you walk in the place is definitely different from your usual restaurant experience.  Order at the counter like any cafeteria/cafe and bring your number to a public table or if you choose sit at the bar.    I went for the bar this time around.  Service was somewhat slow, but I wasn't in a rush that day.  I ordered a water since it was only a lunch break and went for the AZ burger.  Overall, the burger is pretty darn good in my books.  I didn't really care for one thing; the bun.  It was pretty dry and bulky, but the burger itself was cooked to perfection.  I had it medium and it was topped with Green Chili, Lettuce, Cheddar, and House Sauce.  I'm not sure what the House Sauce was, but all in all the ingredients worked and was mesh of sloppiness that reminded me of a Sloppy Joe.  Anything that brings back memories is a plus to my palates.    The place itself was a farm art shop.  Very cute boutique-like stuff and a bakery that pumps out some desserts and baked goods.  The staff seemed friendly as if they were working at a Whole Foods.  Overall, a great atmosphere to chill and ain't nothing like supporting your local farms and restaurant! - Enjoy!",

They're skinny, packed with flavor, and come with a little heat (beware for those of you who don't like spicy.  But if you do, this is such a treat)!  Yumm.  The only semi-disappointment was the pot pie.  Everyone on Yelp was raving about the pot pie.  I thought it was okay... I've definitely had better.  The crust wasn't as flaky as I'd liked.

The service here was great. The employees who took our orders were super nice and welcoming, as were the employees who brought out our food and drink. I ordered the classic two egg/toast/potato/bacon breakfast. I don't eat meat, so I gave the bacon to a friend. The eggs were fine, but the side of potatoes is three unseasoned tiny potatoes that were not crispy or anything exciting. The toast was okay, nothing special. The jam it comes with looked really good, so I put it on the toast and when I took a bite it tasted like pure alcohol, which was strange. Either it's not like anything I've ever had before, or it had gone bad. My other friends were also feeling pretty \"whatever\" about their meals. My friends burrito came with 3 grapes and a small orange slice. For the price of the food (each of us spent around $15), I don't think the quality was there. I'm giving a 2 for the food, but would give 5 stars if it were on service alone.",

Your establishment was full of holiday cheer in all the correct ways,  impeccable service, seriously clean environment...friendly smiles from your staff abounded!  My wife ordered the Quiche that was a little dated (however the above mentioned matrix overrode this concern) and I throughly enjoyed the Rooster Booster! A serious compliment to your staff as both our orders were served to us by two of your friendly staff at precisely the same time! We barely had enough appetite remaining but what the heck we also shared your fresh and hot Cinnamon Roll to our delight.  GREAT JOB ALL THE WAY AROUND...we will be back!!!  The Phantom Diner",

We also ordered the rainbow salad as an appetizer but I was disappointed when I discovered that the bowl is full of spinach and just topped with assorted veggies for dipping. We brought back some pop tarts and a corn cookie and they were awesome! The downside of our visit was the service. We were the only family dining there at the time (Thursday around 6pm) it was mostly groups of co-workers grabbing some after work dinner and drinks. The atmosphere was pretty loud but I didn't mind it. Anyway, we only saw our server 3 times throughout the course of our meal; when he got our order, brought us a to-go box, and then the check. Never checked on us to see if we needed anything and never even offered refills. It was quite disappointing since he was also working on the table right behind us and he was constantly there chatting it up with them and offering food suggestions, explaining the menu, and checking up on them every few minutes. I would say he checked on their table at a 3:1 ratio in contrast to us. I wouldn't mind going back because like I said, the food was good, the ambiance was nice, and the hostess was really sweet too. It was just that one server.",

I had a rice dish with organic market vegetables which was also very, very good! I'm not sure what sauce they put on it but it really helped make the dish sing. It gave flavor to the vegetables without covering them up. I will say, for rice and vegetables $14 seems like a lot. However they were cooked expertly, & I really did enjoy myself. Beautiful restaurant with both inside and outside seating. I will be back! One note: service was friendly,  but a little slow. Also, when someone orders chips and salsa (we did) don't make them feel like a holes,  for asking for Xtra hot sauce (out server seemed inconvenienced by our simple request)",

Oh and the macaroons--scrumptious. But if you want food that will stick to your ribs and stay in your belly, look elsewhere, or you will be spending upwards of $20 here for a meal. The cranberry macaroon is my favorite flavor there, but the salted caramel ain't half-bad either. And there is glitter on them. What the what? Awesome! My friend did not really like the bread on the pulled pork sandwich, but my other friend loved the chicken quesadilla, which is a feat in itself since she is a harsher \"critic\" than I am.",

They had a special for the AZ Burger (green chile, lettuce, cheese, and a dressing topping) and a beer for only $8, so I jumped on that.  I guess this deal is for each night that the D-backs have a home game...  I then ordered a side of fries to round out the meal and sat down to wait for the food to be delivered.  The food came out relatively quickly and was delicious.  The seating area inside was a bit small, as they had maybe 8 or so tables on the side of the room.  As a result, it was a little loud while we were eating our meal.  That said, the food was still delicious.  I definitely recommend the $8 D'backs deal.  As a first-time visitor to the cafe, it was a little challenging to figure everything out.  You order at the counter, but the counter doesn't initially stand out (depending on the entrance door you use).  Ordering & delivering food seemed to be a little bit of a challenge with the cafe employees, but we eventually got everything sorted out.  Overall, the food was good and worth a visit, but some of the logistics around the restaurant could definitely benefit from being tuned.",

The waitress did not check in on us after they gave us our food and we watched her and other waitresses socialize with friends. Not to mention the chips we ordered had burnt fries mixed it with them. We waited a good 15 minutes to ask the waitress to bring our bill but couldn't even catch her attention while she socialized. We finally got up and paid at the registers.

The ambience of the building is very open, urban, hip, and raw with the exposed ceiling beams. I loved the neighborhood, community feeling mixed in with the urban, raw look of the materials used.   I had a pot pie that was amazing!!! It was hearty, filling, and totally hit the spot. I love having a meal that is filling and hearty but doesn't leave me feeling so full that I feel like I'm walking around with a brick in my stomach.   The side of Garlic Mashed Potatoes I had were equally amazing as the pot pie. I loved that the potatoes were made fresh, and not overly buttered and salted.   I came here the other morning for coffee before heading over to the amazing Phoenix Public Market on Saturday's and was not only very happy with my coffee that I had, but I must say one of the gentlemen working the bar was very easy on the eyes. Just saying!!! Love getting great service, from great looking people too!",

The cucumber and pickled onion side salad is delicious but messy people beware! This is a messy persons worst night mare and upon ordering you are asking to just ruin a piece of your clothing.. Still worth it though!   Anyways I got in to the cafe today with Cole and we shared the del real sandwich with a cinnamon role. The sandwich will definitely be my go to from here on out. No complaints on the cinnamon role either. They heat the pre made pastry up and top it with cream cheese frosting, yum!   Definitely go in soon and redeem your free cookie but tip: stay away from double chocolate and stick to the vegan peanut banana !",

    "text": "This place is awesome.  This place is perfect for college students.  I was able to sit there and finish up some assignments - there is free wifi, get down on some coffee (They even brew cartel coffee!), and enjoy some great food! Located right by TAYLOR PLACE and DOWNTOWN ASU campus & it's just a short walk from Roosevelt row for FIRST FRIDAYS.  The location is prime.      FOOD:  Their vegetables are ultra ultra fresh and their ingredients are all great quality.  They get their stuff from the neighboring farmers market and you can taste the difference in the food when compared to other places.  The chicken is just tempting you as you walk in as they have them rotating in the over right by the cash registers.  I had that, some garlic mashed potatoes and a sweet potato - my life changed.   DRINKS: They have some really nice selections available on draft and they have good deals on margaritas and sangrias available by pitcher. I have to say - nothing compares.  Freshly squeezed juices and real fruit - none of this margarita mix BS.     SERVICE/STAFF:  The service was exceptional.  They made sure I had everything I needed when they brought me my order.  The managers and the owners are really nice people.   The layout of the cafe creates a sense of wonder for first time visitors because there is a bar/coffee station, cash registers straight ahead, people eating, yet no servers. They did a good job at explaining the restaurant concept, what they are going for, etc.    If you sit at the bar, you can get FULL SERVICE.  Otherwise you can grab a menu, order at the register, grab a number and sit down - they'll bring it to you.  Pretty neat.     Give this place a try.  You WILL NOT be disappointed.  A nice mom and pop shop that should get more support and credit for sure!",

There is a full coffee bar and regular bar.  The service was amazing.  The gentleman that served us, made a connection with me immediately.  He saw my yelp check-in for a free cookie.  You can even get a macaroon!  He patiently waited while my boys chose their cookies and decided which bottled soda they would share.  He talked about his nephew that he and his partner love to spoil.  I would come back just for his amazing service.  My youngest son ordered the chickpea pancakes and they were my favorite.  My hubs and oldest ordered burgers and fries, they were delicious.  I ordered the quinoa and poached egg breakfast with roasted veggies.  It was really delicious, the eggs were perfectly poached!  It has such a funky vibe I will definitely make the trek from Gilbert to visit this little oasis in the city again soon.  You won't regret the experience!",

Waters were brought to the table after waiting unusually long, and the server disappeared yet again. No question if we were ready or anything of that sort. Once he did come back to our table, we ordered a pitcher a beer and it was never brought out to us. We didn't even realize until our food was brought out to us. We didn't even bother to bring it up. We also had to ASK for refills of our waters (I was afraid to even ask for a refreshment at this point) When you walk into a certain type of atmosphere and get side swiped with careless service, that tends to leave people with a bitter taste in their mouth. The food was delicious but not enough to bring me back. I don't want to feel like I have to beg for a service I'm paying for. Too bad, I had high hopes for this place.",

My almond butter and jelly sandwich was excellent and much better than the simple name suggests while the soup was rustic and tangy and a perfect compliment.  The chicken quesadilla was solid and great with the craft brews they have.  The bar had tasty cocktails as well with my girlfriend trying the gin and watermelon special.  Overall a great lunch spot and would highly recommend.",

I particularly love the roasted cauliflower and the tri-tip.  The desserts are incredible- pastry chef, Sarah Chisholm is always inventing amazing new additions and twists on the standards.  Cookies, macarons, homemade pop tarts- dank.  The only reason I give four stars is that the service is so inconsistent.  Sometimes it takes forever to get your food.  Sometimes the order gets messed up.  While the food is reasonably priced (especially with the 20% student discount), the portions can be skimpy.  This happens more often when I get takeout for some reason.",

You order at the counter get handed a number find your seat and they run your order out to you unless you just go for the grab and go section. Also a small amount of mostly local goods including books and nick knacks and some grains.  I tried a salad called Public Market Vegetables. It was a mix of marinated, steamed and raw vegetables and went for the add on chicken up charge. It was a very fresh tasting salad with a stunning mix of vegetables of different textures. Carrot ribbons and spiral crisp carrot spaghetti, sprouts, fresh dill, spinach leaves and marinated cauliflower, broccoli and other vegetables. The white meat chicken seemed poached and was very fresh. For me this salad had too much acid in the dressing or maybe just combined with the marinated vegetables for me but I still thought it was a very above average salad.  My husband loved the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie. The pork was tender with a really perfect spice level and all that tasty sauce just melted into the crust like butter.  They have all kinds of seating here. Sofas tables with chairs and bench tables.  The restrooms are unisex.  Your silverware is in a bin on your table and you have to hope little kids didn't play with your utensils before you used them.",

I like that it's creamier but still retains the chai. Very good.",

I think I had it so blown-up in my mind that it was going to be good, or even great  that I . . . oh, what the heck, I don't want to lie about it . . .it was fantastic! I ordered the Mediterranean Salad and it was enormous. I tried and tried, but I just could not finish it all. Not for lack of trying believe me . . . and I always save room for dessert. But . . .   This time I had to buy my dessert from the bakery case and take it home with me. A very large chocolatey-fudgie cookie. And, believe me that was a \"snack\" worth waiting for that evening.  My only disappointment was the cinnamon roll that I bought for breakfast. It looked beautiful, but a secondary spice that overpowered the cinnamon made it a disappointment.  It was a good roll, just not a great cinnamon roll. My advice is to take out the \"other\" spice and maybe add a few pecans . . . and whatever you do leave off the sugar icing. A little cream cheese icing would have gone a lot further to help me finish off my breakfast coffee!   I did not try the Cafe coffee, since it was a steaming day . . . next time. Oh, yes, I will be back to try some of the other goodies on the menu. Perhaps the Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie, or the Roosevelt Row Bagel, or one of their great sounding housemade soups - Southwest black bean, lentil curry coconut soup, or their beans & rice bowl.  Hunger is overtaking me . . . do you know where the car keys are?",

Owned by the same guy who owns St Francis, it's a classy place to grab a beer or a coffee. The bathrooms are dope too. Nothing super special, but unique and fitting. They pay attention to detail.   The only reason I give it four stars instead if 5 is for their menu. I wish there were seasonal specials. I realize it probably keeps costs down to not invent new specials but even like a flatbread? The 18$ roasted salmon plate just doesn't fit here. I come frequently and the menu seems stagnant.   Don't get me wrong the food is uh-mazing. Everything we've had is great. The Mediterranean and the chino salads are great. My fiance loves the pork chile verde pot pie and the grilled cheese is total comfort food (I suggest adding tomato or avocado).  If you haven't stopped by this gem in downtown I highly recommend it!",

I just love the feel of this place; bright, wide open and different areas to sit.   Their happy hour is daily, 3-close, $5 cocktails and mini pitchers. I enjoyed my bar drinks. I also ordered the soft pretzel with cheese dip ($3). It was okay but I think what made it lackluster was the lukewarm dip. Disappointing. I really enjoyed my pork chile pot pie ($9.50). Both of my friends ordered this too! Mine had a lot of pork in it, my friend did not have hardly any, so that seemed inconsistent.   Other than that, I still enjoyed everything. It is a great addition to the area.",

It was near Roosevelt Row which is the art district in Phoenix and this place did the job in expressing it! To start with the positives I'll say this: the parking was great. They had a whole lot that you didn't have to pay for which I was so happy to see coming from a city that has VERY strict laws on parking. The customer service was okay- nothing special. It's a cashier counter type place so it was hard for me to start conversation except when it came to placing my order. The service was fast though which I enjoyed. The bar menu, coffee menu and lunch/dinner menu was very well put together and I really loved what I ordered (picture posted). The set up was very nice too interior and exterior!

I would expect more creative options from a place like this. They have a bagel with hummus and a salad (both are good - love the dill in the salad), but they don't serve the vegan bagel option or salads before 11. The only vegan option for breakfast is a bowl of fruit - always fresh and delicious, but way too light.   They serve Cartel coffee, which is very strong and they don't have decaf for espresso drinks, but they do have soy milk.",

Large tables are great for groups of people or large amounts of homework, small tables for small groups, and a nice outdoor patio with heaters and a fireplace in the winter.   The bar brews Cartel coffee if you only feel like studying with a cup of coffee, but you will probably get weird stares from servers if you're doing homework there past 6 pm.  The only funky thing is that at 6 pm it goes from a walk-up ordering system to a sit-down ordering system.

Frittata is great for folks on a diet (read: I could have used a few more bites) while the flanched flarney garney is quite hardy (too good to stop, but  you should anyway).   No free refills on the coffee but otherwise a great breakfast/cocktail hour. Will go back, hopefully soon!",

This time, we had a long day at work and wanted to relax and try something different. Should have went with my gut as gone to Turf, where I'm writing this review from.   The bartender was friendly enough when we sat down, but that was the end of that. We put on our order and wait. Waited. Then waited some more. All the while, Our waitress/the bartender couldn't care less that we had gone about 15 minutes without our water glasses being filled up. Wasn't until we asked her for more that we got it. But even after we got our refills, still no food for another 10 minutes. How long does is take to make a salad an a burger? Even in a locally-grown ingredient establishment.  When I finally got my salad, I took a few bites and was extremely disappointed. The mix of tastes left me with the thought of turpentine. I know cabbage is bitter, but holy cow. I've never tastes cabbage like that. Or maybe it was the ginger. Whatever it was, it was horrible. I barely took a few bites until I couldn't do it more. The Chino salad was the wrong choice.   I pretty much had it with the place by then. I didn't say anything because I was over it at that point and just wanted to get the hell out of there. We didn't even pay with her. Got a 20% discount as an ASU student though. Just about the only good thing about this ordeal. Sucks since I like buying local. Oh well.   Never again.",

It was just all so good.  Everything was fresh with as much local ingredients that they could fit in.   We went back for happy hour again today.

Yes, as some have noted, it does seem like it can be a bit busy but the food looked great and I look forward to coming back for say dinner, one evening, and getting a better feel for the quality of the service and the food. I do like that the beers on tap were all micro-brews (begone though foul progeny of InBev!), and included beers from several local breweries and at least one beer, when I was there, from the Lost Abbey. I also noticed that in the liquor selection was bottle of copper city bourbon from Arizona Distilling company, which is made about two blocks from my house in Tempe, and the coffee being served was from Cartel, a local coffee chain and roaster. In short, when you come and buy food and drinks here, you are not only supporting a local restaurant but also a number of other local creators of quality food and drink.   So far I'm a fan and look forward to seeing if a return visit will bring me into the five star category.",

I saw they had woodchuck on draft for $5 a pitcher and I just had to check it out!  I came with my friend and it took us 17 minutes to be seated! Not too horrible if it was busy, however it wasn't busy. The problem was that there was a sign that says wait to be seated, then the bartender said it was all open seating, then after sitting at the tall table next to the bar we were told by the host it wasn't open for seating THEN he clocked out and never actually seated us so as soon as 2 stools opened at the bar we just sat there since no one came back for us.  Seating issue figured out. Yay! On to chips and salsa... We ordered chips and salsa which took 29 minutes to come out. I felt like we were being punked or something. Even the nice ladies next to us mentioned to the bartender that we were still awaiting our chips. Btw the salsa and guac was mediocre at best. After all of this we weren't even interested in ordering an entree. I had my eye on the pot pie but they were out of it anyway.  To sum it all up, if you are going to sit at the bar and are only interested in the happy hour specials, great! If you want good service, go elsewhere.",

    "text": "First time a guest and I went to PPMC, we ordered from the counter and sat at the bar. We were immediately scolded for ordering at the counter and taking a seat at the bar. Apparently, one must be seated at the bar to order if you are to be seated there.  So I went back solo today....sat at the bar. I chose one of only a few seats available. There were some used plates and glasses on the bar at my place that the previous patron had just left. I asked the bartender if it was OK that I sat there. He assured me that he would clear the plates/glasses and get me started. 10 minutes later, nothing...no eye contact, no clearing of the old crap and no acknowledgement that I was there. Subsequently, I left. Ordering nothing and having no professional service.  This place is cool....the ambiance is great...but honestly, the service SUCKS. There are many places I could chose from in that vicinity that has stellar service AND food/drinks. So I chose to go to one of those instead.  It is a shame that a bartender cannot multi-task and an establishment is void of customer service.  Come on PPMC....get it together! I don't think I will come back. Lux, Rumbar. and a host of other establishments puts short pants on your service. You may \"look\" good, but if cannot deliver, I'm out.  I will say that the brandy spiked sangria (which we had during our first visit) is extraordinary. Try it.....unfortunately, I'll go down the street to Carly's for their own version and get some proper service.",

Service on the Tuesday we visited with a party of 6 was painfully slow despite a quiet dinner crowd. Our server repeatedly pointed out that he didn't know much about the menu because he usually works at St. Francis. He was pleasant but distracted, forgetful, and uninformative. They were out of pot pies even though the place was virtually empty and \"the computer said\" they had two left according to our server. The prime rib special was cooked perfectly, but under-seasoned. Might try again for a weekday lunch, since that's when this place should really shine, but I'll stick with St. Francis for dinner.",

Despite my affinity for cinnamon rolls, I bypassed their amazing-looking selection and opted for a more sensible chicken salad sandwich. It was perfect in flavor, proportions (not too much bread, no too much mayo), texture, and size.  If the cookies I took to go are any indication of the rest of their baked goods, I really missed out on that cinnamon roll! Everything coming out of the kitchen looked fantastic - even the french fries were a work of art.  Food aside, the atmosphere is lively and inviting - there were families, couples, singletons like me. Staff was super friendly, even late in the afternoon on what I assume was a busy brunch Sunday. They have a super bar area and great patio seating. Also, nice little selection of gourmet and eclectic gifts for purchase.  My next trip to Phoenix definitely includes a couple stops here!",

I went here a week ago, same old happy hour, then went again Sat night.... it has now changed. The only cocktails that are 5$ for happy hour are the lee travino and the sangria.... booo. I would prefer they limit the time of happy hour and include all of the signature drinks (read: their sister restaurant St Francis' model).  I can't see spending 8$ a pop for my fave drink here (the farmer's cup) since it is small, not very boozy, and very inconsistent from bartender to bartender. I was willing to risk that it wouldn't be such a good one depending on who was working for the 5$, but not for 8. Additionally, the beers available on happy hour are limited to two as well. This doesn't make sense to me... is there really that big a difference from beer to beer in cost? This WAS my go to place in downtown Phoenix.... probably won't be anymore. If I were this cafe, I'd revamp the happy hour so it follows suit with their sister restaurant.   PS the strawberry poptart and cheesy pretzels are still good.",

The pancakes definitely needed the agave syrup as they would have been dry without it but the flavor of the total pancake package was delicious!   Cookie with Yelp check-in was awesome, I got the nutter-butter type cookie (i am not sure if that was the actual name.) It was a recommendation, I typically don't go for peanut butter type cookies but this one is a winner!  I also tasted the \"Devil's Mess\" which was eggs, spinach, chorizo, chiles and onions...for those of us that are pansies when it comes to spice you may want to stay away from this item, it was pretty spicy per my taste buds.

The burrito must have had 3 or 4 eggs - it was huge and full of cheese and bacon and best of all it was grilled - I love that. Tasted great. My wife ordered a salad but was a little annoyed when the dude at the register pointed her to the premade salads in the display case. Had she known it was already in plastic she would have ordered something fresher. The star of the meal was my daughter's bagel. The strawberry cream cheese I could have done without, but the bagel itself was homemade (in the restaurant) and it was fantastic. On the way out we picked up another 3 bagels to-go for breakfasts during our trip.",

We ordered the The Devil's Mess, The Flanched Flarney Garney, soup+salad (daily special corn bisque and Curried Chicken), BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich, a side of fries, and a side of fries. $50! That was with a small tip. Portion wise, it was slightly small, but I was okay with that since we were traveling and didn't want leftovers. I told myself it's okay to pay more money for quality food. The food was great, but not over the moon fantastic. The staff was nice and patient, especially because my daughter took a long time order. I also appreciated that they let the children sample the pulled pork.  Dessert: one daughter raved about the salted caramel macarons, but the lemon cake was meh. No frosting.",

Each time you order, their selection is just a little bit different depending on what fresh veggies are in season.   They also have great coffee drinks and desserts. My only complaint is they don't slice the big cakes. Today's was strawberry brown sugar. It looked Devine! But they only sell by the cake. It's just plain tortuous for us small family people who can't buy a whole cake! Give a girl some love and sell by the slice! Please!!",

The service is always friendly and they remember your face and sometimes your order.  They have a cute little coffee bar/bar set up with great indoor/outdoor eating space.  The tortillas and salsa that come with the Devil's Mess are a God-send.  They have juices, pastries and a large variety of menu items that range from healthy to IDGAF-about-my-waistline.   We took a friend there one time and she was wondering why they put mashed potatoes on top of the cinnamon rolls.  We laughed and convinced her that mashed potatoes are great on top of cinnamon rolls and she probably still thinks that, but it was actually the thick frosting stacked on top.   I've taken friends, family, and business friends here and have always enjoyed the menu, both breakfast, lunch and dinner.",

I've usually been there during the week, not on a busy weekend, and you are lucky if you get a second visit from the server that does not include delivery of the bill. The bartender with the beard can also use some customer service lessons. He answers questions with a yes or no, will not elaborate when questions asked about a particular beer or drink, and just seems to be bothered by customers. I was just in again this Weds and had another disappointing experience with service. Prob won't be returning anytime soon.",

And I ordered the BBQ Platter, with that pork on my mind.  When it arrived the chicken was warm, but the pork was cold! it has warm BBQ sauce on it, but it was cold. They were probably thinking that pouring hot sauce on old, cold pork would heat it enough. It did not. Not smart. If your intent is to pass off old cold pork as fresh, at least heat it up first! Geez. I explained to the waiter that it was cold.  I think they tried to heat it, not sure. It came back slightly warm and super dry.  I was super bummed and disappointed.",

    "text": "After much thought of where we'd brunch amidst the breakfast oasis of options that Phoenix has to offer, I decided upon Phoenix Public Market Cafe. It was a lazy Sunday around 11:30am, I had time to kill and I was prepared to wait in line. To my surprise, there were only two people in front of me! Wait, what I am I supposed to order? The menu had many salivating options and I was one of those people who just couldn't decide right away. To add to my mental food frenzy, Phoenix is no longer my home and I only return every couple of years so I had to make a good choice.   Thankfully, my girlfriend, a regular at PPMC, came to my rescue and recommended the pork chile verde pot pie. The pork chile verde pot pie was an excellent choice! It was delicious and had the most flaky and buttery crust ever! Pot pies are one of my many guilty food indulgences and this was definitely one of my favorites! The portion size was generous and I did not finish, but maybe it is because I also ate a side of bacon, a lemon and pistachio macaron, and a yummy, large peanut butter cookie sandwich with my meal! What can I say, I'm only in Phoenix every once in a while!  The service at PPMC is friendly and prompt and the ambiance is casual, inviting, and hip. I love the market meets cafe idea. The outdoor area had picnic style seating and fresh flowers adorned each table. It was a cheerful atmosphere for a wonderful brunch in the beautiful Phoenix sun. My next visit to Arizona, I will surely return to Phoenix Public Market Cafe and dine again!",

After awhile I call out to the bartender just to get his attention he tells me to hold on (with an annoyed tone) finally I tell him I'm in a bit of a rush can I place my order and he just looks at me and says \"well?\" So I order. And he just throws some waters in front of us. Placing my order was the only time I made eye contact and communicated with my bartender the whole time he never asked how the food was or even of we wanted anything besides water he was rude and unprofessional. Not a very personable staff member he was. I'll be back for more drinks but that bartender needs an attitude adjustment.",

For dinner, my boyfriend loves the pot pie and when decide to splurge, their roast chicken is so flavorful and moist. I also like their sweet potatoes and island bowl wih fresh blanched veggies, aioli and nori. Yum. Okay I'm drooling.

Somewhat limited space indoors, but also had outdoor patio that appeared to be dog friendly. The only drawback on this night was our soft pretzel appetizer we ordered with our beer. The first one they brought out was burnt. We had to send it back, it was so charred. It took them two minutes to bring out a replacement, but it was still cold inside. Apparently these are frozen and thrown into the oven for a few minutes? When our waiter asked about this one, we told him it was cold and he just nodded his head and moved on. Probably didn't hear us and assumed we said fine. At least it was edible and actually would have been quite good warm. Did not eat a meal, so can't comment on the food. Will definitely go back and try it again. Happy hour included $5 for select pitchers of beer, which basically was 2 pints. A really good deal if one of the 2 selected beers are to your liking. The beer selection was pretty minimal, but they had 5 or six craft brew taps.",

It is right up there with the most delicious cocktail I've ever had (a jalapeno mojito at House at Secret Garden). It's rimmed in salt & pepper and has fresh basil and cucumbers in it. It's slightly sweet and pleasingly sour and absolutely refreshing and delicious.  I had the soup-of-the-day--pumpkin, which was sublime. The green chile burger was very good. Hubby's pulled pork sandwich was very good. Baked sweet potato had a yummy relish on it that was unexpected and very tasty.  I did find that the menu is quite limited. I ordered the burger mainly because I couldn't find anything else I really wanted... except the salmon, but at $18 it seemed quite overpriced.  The place has a \"cool\" vibe and some interesting items in the small market area. Due to the large warehouse design, it was noisy. I will definitely return for the Farm Cup and hopefully catch some interesting daily special items.",

The obsession with high gravity IPA's, Hefe's, or sweet dark beers-- at Phoenix Public Market & elsewhere-- is so tired. In an era & in a neighborhood where there are lots of tap selections like this, why not diversify and have an intelligent, crisp pilsner on line? I'm not talking Bud or Stella (blech...), but something like Polestar, 4 Peaks Poppin Pils, Firestone Pivo (2013 GABF gold medal winner), or one of about a dozen other delicious crafts available? Or, an awesome german pilsner (Spaten? Lowenbrau?).  I find it quite mystifying. Whoever makes the beer selection, pretty please expand the Market's palette & swap out a line or two... make an intelligent selection or two of delicious pilsners and you'll sell TONS more beer, I so guarantee it!    Thirsty, with my fingers crossed...",

I had 1/2 of their breakfast sandwich and 1/2 of their green chile burger, along with my free Nutter Butter for dessert (I love it when business give us a little something for checking in with yelp).  The breakfast sandwich (Flanched Flarney Garney) was just delicious.  The avocado specifically was spot on and totally made the sandwich.  The AZ burger was well cooked, but completely under-seasoned and bland.  I hoped the chiles would help, but they just weren't enough.  I had a pitcher (don't let the name fool you, this is basically two pints worth) of Orange Blossom beer and one of the Farmer's Cup cocktails - both were delicious.  To top it all off, their homemade Nutter Butter cookie was just outstanding.  The light and fluffy peanut creme in the middle was melt in your mouth-tastic.  I will have to come back during the open air market, I really like the vibe and atmosphere here - totally coming back!",

I waited a while at the door to be seated...but no one came or even explained if it was open seating.

It's a welcoming atmosphere and I love the flowers for sale.   The food is very good. The group I went with all ordered something different and tried each other's items. The pork chili pot pie is the way to go, it's got a good taste and consistency of spice to it. The Flanched Flarney Garney (egg sandwich) was good, but it would be amazing if they would change the bread from a hamburger bun to toast. It was way to bready with the bun, I ended up eating the sandwich sans bun.  Check in with yelp and get a free cookie. I got a s'more cookie. It was absolutely delicious and stole the show for the meal.",

First of all, my old buddy Mike was manning the coffee bar and made me a kick-ass cup of cold pressed coffee with agave syrup in it.  It was delish!  I had some reservations about the menu but we all found something yummy that pleased the palate.  I had the granola, creme fraiche, and fruit...my only quibble there was too much tasteless watermelon and not enough berries along with way too little granola, especially for the price.  It was enjoyable overall...not quite a \"destination\" joint based on the menu but it has good wait staff and a cool vibe inside.    So, how to get another couple of stars?  1.  offer specials and/or \"locals-only\" deals. 2.  offer more items on the menu for breakfast 3.  put the lemon aioli on the menu for the potatoes  Fancy food combinations aside, value and taste will keep folks coming in regularly.",

Although it is just drinks :/ I love appetizers when it comes to Happy Hour but they did have a good selection of drinks and drinks specials during this time. The menu was smaller, in my opinion, and a little but \"off-the-wall\" It definitely not your traditional \"chilli's or TGIF\" menu which I loved although this also presented a challenge for me! Small menu and things I'm not familiar with?!? Challenge accepted!!! I LOVED my The Rachel sandwich! Absolutely something amazing and I keep thinking about wanting to go back for. The turkey is freshly baked and shaved off, daily...soooo moist!!! It also had fresh coleslaw, sauerkraut (which I do not normally order), swiss cheese, and house dressing on a sourdough bread! Omg...what a combo!!! So happy I decided on this! Our server was perfect. Very attentive, understanding when a friend did not like her drink selection and even brought us a whole plate full of their pastries for desert since we had mentioned the Yelp check-in! Don't forget!!! You get a free cookie :) Hands down, I recommend the place. I give it a 4, only because it's not a full menu of things that are on my fav's list! Overall, VERY good!!! I'll be back hopefully sooner than later!",

    "text": "My husband and I stopped in last night for a quick bite before a movie. We had about an hour before the movie started. Upon walking in I had a good feeling -- the atmosphere was good, music good. I'd been before for breakfast and didn't have a bad time.   We sat and waited for our server for what felt like a long time. When she finally arrived, we ordered drinks and sandwiches. She up-sold us on sharing an order of fries. We had told our server upon ordering that we were trying to make a movie.   Drinks took too long to arrive and that was about the last time we saw our server. Someone else brought out our sandwiches and it seemed to take too long for two simple sandwiches. Our fries didn't arrive with sandwiches. We were halfway through those sandwiches before the fries arrived--they clearly forgot them and gave us fries from another table, causing them to have to wait as well. Original server still never returned and never asked us if we wanted another drink. After eating, server finally returned and we reminded her about the movie and requested the check. Took a bit, but she dropped it off and never returned. We finally went to the counter in the front and asked to pay. We were told only our server could close us out and the girl at the counter had to find our server. More waiting. Finally server appeared, said she hoped she didn't make us miss our movie (so she remembered we were trying to get a movie), but never really apologized for basically going MIA.   Food was great. Atmosphere was great. Location is great. Service is seriously lacking in both attention and basic professionalism. The problems with service negatively impacted our experience and I'd think twice before stopping here again because of that. We don't need to spend money to be ignored--there are lots of places who have their service down. I really want to like this place and I'll probably give it another shot at some point, but I think the Phoenix Public Market Cafe needs to realize it's not enough to be hip and cool, if you treat the customers like an afterthought no one will want to come back.  We made it to the movie, but just barely in time.",

    "text": "I had high hopes for this place. It had a very nicely decorated interior and the menu sounded good. However, the food and service did not live up to my expectations. We ordered the pretzels and jalapeno cheese sauce for an appetizer (my fave thing) and the pretzels came out luke warm and the cheese sauce was so bland. You could not even taste the jalapeno. Also, our server did not inform us of their happy hour specials, which we would have taken advantage of. My boyfriend ordered the AZ burger which claims to have cheese and a spicy aioli. The beef was so juicy but you could not taste any of the toppings. It literally just tasted like beef. At least it was good quality beef. My Mediterranean salad can be described as \"meh\". Overall, boring food seriously lacking in flavor. Our server also largely ignored us. We probably won't be back, especially since it was overpriced. A shame.",

    "text": "I went to ASU downtown so this was a common spot to settle in with some classmates with a cup of coffee and poptart. It's not anything for me to run home about and recommend to everyone I know and meet but it's decent enough for me to come again if I were in the area. The Strawberry pop tart and a vanilla latte is by far my favorite quickie little breakfast there. The basic bacon, eggs, potatoes, and toast breakfast can't really go wrong. I did get the burrito once and was really very unimpressed. Be warned, the music is loud but there is a great, downtown hip atmosphere with a garden lining the front of the restaurant. I enjoyed sipping my lattes and eating my poptarts on rainy days with the big windows on the south side of the restaurant. It's at least worth a shot if you want to try a restaurant with subtle changes to the standard breakfast feasts (ie., chickpea pancakes, whole potatoes in stead of hashbrowns, genuinely decent espresso from the coffee bar rather than some rando half-assing the espresso machine).",

    "text": "I know many people feel that there is not a lot to do in downtown Phoenix......and for the most part that is True. However upon visiting this cafe I found a glimmer of hope for those who want a nice.....quaint.....relaxing.....and semi-romantic location to hang out. I hear on the weekends this place turns into an open outdoor market.....but I think I would prefer the nightlife when it transforms back into a cafe. There is nice mood lighting.....a stand up and sit down bar......huge wooden tables for groups of 4 or more......huge patio like tables for 6 or more......and of course your standard 2 and 4 person tables. The Patio is HUGE.....and I do mean HUGE......the cool zones are awesome blowing at full blast. This cafe is in a perfect location as well because there is tons of foot traffic and this place will definitely draw you in.  So why not 5 stars you ask? Well I ordered the rotisserie chicken (half portion) and the garlic mashed potatoes. Now for 12 bucks I really expected more.....also the chicken didn't have a strong rotisserie flavor like I thought it should have. The garlic mashed potatoes lacked the garlic portion.....but they were creamy and buttery. Don't get me wrong the food was very good just need bigger portions and a little more flavor. The service was outstanding and because we checked in through YELP.....we received a free cookie and even though they are gluten free......they are AWESOME. I had a banana oatmeal raisin which I didn't think I would like....but it was simply delicious.   So if your ever hanging out in downtown Phoenix and looking for a good healthy bite to eat.....and perhaps some peace and quiet.....try the Phoenix Public Cafe. Eat, Drink, and be Merry my Friends!!!!!",

    "text": "Here's one to check off the list! I've had my eye on this place ever since moving to Phoenix and I must say, it was kind of worth the wait!  Though I was not able to try their coffee, I did make it in time for their happy hour (3-close, every day) and wanted to take advantage of that fact. I ordered the Pulled Pork Sandwich and a pitcher of beer, also since you get a free cookie if you check-in on Yelp I went with the corn cookie to see how well it ranks against Momofuku in NY and that of Cartel's.  The pulled pork sandwich was came with thick pieces of pulled pork, flavorful, good sauce and the red cabbage/bell pepper slaw was delicious with it. The bun was substantial enough to sop up the pulled pork juices and hold everything together. Comes with some fruit as well. For $5 on HH, it's pretty damn good for the price you pay. Also for $5 you can grab yourself a pitcher of beer (2 glasses)! The corn cookie albiet free, was not the best corn cookie I've ever had it was a bit too dense and hard- was it because I came late in the day? Anyways, it was free so I can't complain too much! Normal pricing seems a bit steep, but this cafe has it all from soups, sandwiches, salads, coffee, alcohol and pastries.  Public Market has that warehouse feel with reclaimed wood furniture, tree stump tables, a bar, brick and exposed piping. It's very aesthetic and gives the place a nice, industrial yet rustic feel. I love the big windows so you can have a bit of sun yet get work done on the tables in the corner of the cafe.  Can't wait to be back for their coffee and to use up that little corner of the cafe to bask in the sunlight!",

They are fresh and even have options for vegans. This is he perfect place to eat when you have a crew of omnivores and carnivores. Oh, let me also mention, the grain bowls, even though usually served cold, can be heated and meat can be added. Just kicking it up a notch",

    "text": "I haven't been here in ages but was so happy that my friend opted to dine here. Yay!  I arrived at around 11:30 a.m. and the parking lot was already full. Luckily there was plenty of parking on the street in spite of ASU (nearby) classes in session. You'll pay $2.00 for two hours at the meters.   Having seen \"Eat the Rainbow\" salad photos on Yelp, I decided that would be a good option for me. I ordered that with chicken and had a green tea. We headed to the patio on a glorious winter day. The fireplace was on and it was pretty cozy. We sat in the sun though. Our meal came out very quickly. My salad was delicious and I felt like I was doing something good for my body. The fresh vegetables were crunchy and there were some veggies I had not had before. I think one was a type of radish and the yellow beet was a first. I think I've fallen in love with them.   The salad comes with a trio of sauces but I used them sparingly. The green tea was AH-Mazing and I wish we had time for me to grab a refill. The only teeny-tiny mix-up was that the cashier didn't give me a table number and my bad, I forgot to remind him. I approached one of the workers and told them about it and he immediately corrected the problem and handed me a number. His fast action showed his customer service skills. Thank you!  I checked in on Yelp and got an offer for a free cookie. I refrained but saved the offer for a cheat day.",

After 10 minutes, nada. Ask for beer. Don't get beer. Food arrives, no beer. Ask for beer, get one glass, not a pitcher.  Asked for the pitcher again and receipt back so I could remove the 20% tip, which was completely undeserved. Five minutes later pitcher arrives. To their credit, they rounded up and took $3 off the bill.   As for the food, it wasn't as good as in the past. The bun wasn't fresh, pulled pork was lukewarm, and fries appeared to have been sitting around for a while.   Would I eat here again? Maybe, but there are other places in the neighborhood I'd go first.   Could this have been an anomaly? Maybe, but given the place was near-empty my guess is word has gotten around about the bad service and mediocre food.   Summary: Food, 2 stars. Service, zero stars.",

I got the chicken (which was fine) and paid for Iced Tea.  When I went to the counter, there were two pitchers - one green tea and one black.  Between the two pitchers, there was not enough left to fill the glass. I asked when more was coming out and was told there was no more.  I was offered water. Seriously?  It's Phoenix, AZ in summer, you took money and you had no product.  The least they could have done was offer a refund.  Nope.  I was offered ice water.

Some highlights: - the aesthetics woah!!! It looks like a barn with plants and nice lights.  - They have their own veggies!!!!! So cool. They have chiles growing outside  - their hydration station  - their service was great  The quinoa bowl was not very flavorful. I would have liked more salt or lime. The cookie had macadamia nuts, caramel, chocolate and sea salt. It was interesting. I didn't care much for it to be honest. Based only on these food items, I give them 3/5 stars.   Wish I could go back and try something else.",

I got the Roosevelt Row Bagel and iced tea. Plant your little order number flag thingie on a table. There's ample indoor booths and tables, but why not hang outside next to the fire? It smells essence of barbecue pit meets weekend camp.   The Roosevelt Row bagel is a hearty vegetarian option that even a carnivore like myself can appreciate. It's served open faced with generous servings of hummus, avocado, and micro greens. Could I have been fine just eating half? Yes, but I like challenges.   Servers were attentive and anticipated my needs without hovering too much. I'm definitely snagging one of those home made Pop Tart looking things next time I'm in town.",

I really loved the atmosphere and came when it was cold and outside patio could turn have the fireplace....charming!  So, we belly up to the bar and ordered our drinks lucky it was happy and we had sangria's for only 5 bucks.  This was our last stop so we really were not that hungry so we order cookies and took what was left from the pastry counter home with us.  YELPERS.....check and get a free cookie.  Loved the toffee cookie!    We sat at the bar got great service we only ordered the downtown devil fries which were quite good.  It was enough for 3 to share and love the   dipping sauces on the side.  Anyhow, I came back a week a later with my husband, he loved the beers on tap, the service was great again at the bar got our free cookie (TOFFEE) for my son and he loved.  Great experience for a drink, appetizer and a cookie.  I will come back to try the rotisserie chicken and their salads look amazing.",

Paid and proceeded to wait for my order. Was told by the barista, they can't do a decaf latte because they don't have decaf espresso. Ok, fine. Just give me a regular cup of decaf coffee. They did and they refunded the latte. Now this process took well over 8 minutes.  To get a coffee and refund my money?  Not cool. After which I waited an additional 5 minutes or more to receive my heated croissant.  The lady waiting next to me also commented about waiting over 10 minutes for a bagel.  The decaf coffee was the most bitter worst tasting coffee I have ever had (good thing I didn't pay for it). I guess you get what you pay for.   The croissant was ok  Bottom line if you have a while to wait you might want to try something else in the menu, I would not recommend this place for a quick coffee and treat  Needless to say I won't be going back",

He made a delicious chai latte, with my wife loved! I had a cold brewed coffee, which was average. The food was good!   I had one of the breakfast burritos and turn it vegetarian, which I highly recommend! The only thing I would change is maybe would get it wet style. Be warned though: they definitely don't mess around with their chilies! They were nice chunks of chillies in it.   My wife had a vegetarian sandwich, which was full of flavor. Their fries were decent. However, their menu wasn't overflowing with vegetarian options, which is OK. I wish they had a few more choices. They seemed friendly enough that I'm sure they would substitute to make other things vegetarian. Oh well!  And, a free cookie for yelp check in! You can never go wrong with that.",

The coffee bar is great too, and the iced latte is delicious.    Some of my favorites from what we got: 1) The yogurt granola bowl -the yogurt is perfect and they served it with so much fresh fruit.  The homemade granola is also fantastic and is served on top of the yogurt. 2) The breakfast sandwich -the bun is delicious and fluffy and the bacon is out of this world! 3) The salmon superfood plate - the salmon was cooked perfectly and the quinoa salad was very flavorful and tasty.  The atmosphere is great and I would recommend this place to anyone staying in phoenix who is looking for a relatively inexpensive, yet delicious and healthy, meal.",

It's a unique choice that is not seen at most breakfast places.  I have also tried the Rooster Booster which is your standard egg, potato, toast, and meat choice sampler.  While this is typical breakfast fare, theirs is done very well.  I think this is a great place.  The location is perfect and in walking distance to the Farmer's market as well.",

The food is good but not cheap. The reason I'm never returning is because how I was treated.   I've worked in the hospitality industry off and on for years. (I got my start in a yuppy cafe like this one that also had 2 registers.) I walked up to one of the cashiers and told her I was picking up a take-out order. She said they had it ready but I would have to wait in line in order to pay. The line to pay was out the door. I ordered take-out because I was in a hurry. I wasn't having a lazy Saturday like everyone else.   Every restaurant I've ever worked at had a register that dealt with take-out orders whether we offered curbside service or not. One was for in-house orders and one was for take-out orders. If we were slammed, we'd use both registers for in-house orders but one was still designated for take-out. This was to prevent phone guests from having to wait or walking out.   When I saw the line at PPMC, I knew it would be about a 15-20 min wait because of how slow they operate. I walked out. I never got my order and I never paid for it. I'm sure I'm on their sh** list, but they're on mine, too.",

They only make a certain amount so you may not be able to get it on some days. All of us ordered the pork chili pot pie for dinner.  I got my pot pie first, and ended up only having two pieces of pork in the pie.  My pie consist mostly of onions and sauce, hardly any meat.  It was really spicy and needed a small topping of lettuce, tomatoes and maybe guac to cut the heat.  Our waiter asked how we liked it, and I mentioned that mine hardly had any meat in it.  He said \"you must of gotten the last bunch before they started making more\" ..um that's not a good excuse especially if I'm paying $9.50 for it plus drinks.  I like the fact they start happy hour at 3 pm till close plus they are open early for breakfast.    It's a good place to try downtown and it's owned by the same individual as St. Francis.  It seems to attract an older crowd and families with young kids.",

The only two downsides I have experienced in my several visits, are the inconsistencies when it comes to their coffee bar - the drinks I've had just weren't very good, and when you go at night when seating is required, it feels really disorganized.  All in all, I would recommend that you give this place a try - I feel like they could work out those little kinks and be a really great local place to enjoy some great meals and interesting cocktails.

For a Saturday evening the restaurant was mostly empty and seemed very slow all around. Not many staff members present. My table ordered an appetizer and meals right away. We were brought the incorrect appetizer (totally fine) which was fixed quickly. The appetizers of Devil Fries were definitely nothing special, especially compared to some of the other local spots French fry delicacies! The coleslaw as a side with my meal was also extremely bland. The food was a pretty good \"meh\" but the two stars is for the service. There was a food runner and bus boy, yet our actual server \"checked\" on us once. Never refilled drinks, took an extended amount of time to even bring the check (we ended up just giving him a card without getting it first just to speed the process up) With a ton of places to go within walking distance with comparable, if not better prices, I will skip out on dining in the cafe next time. I love the idea and the local farmers markets and food truck festivals they put on, but the service and lack of quality and care really turned me off this evening.",

Arrived around 8:50 (an hour before they close) and started looking through the menu. Had just decided on a sandwich when one of the employees sweeping the floor made her way over and told us they were closing at 9 because it was so slow tonight. I was irritated that they weren't staying open until their posted hours and the fact that the employee took her time in telling us made it worse. It wasn't even 9 and we couldn't even get a soda - I'm guessing the registers were closed too. All we got was a sorry and a condescending reminder that they were open again in the morning, which didn't really do me any good tonight. Come for the breakfast, just know the hours are apparently dependent on the employees' whims",

    "text": "Was really excited about this place when we saw it was opened. What a mess. The overall problem, as others have noted on here, is that it has so many concepts, it's confusing. For instance, I'm still not sure if I order at the pastry counter if I want to sit at the bar (is this a bar? a fastfood restaurant?).  Anyway, my wife and I went for lunch. Arrived around 11:30 and were greeted at the door by a guy explaining how to order (which was much appreciated). Ordering still was pretty chaotic. At the end of it, we were left to carry our number, my beer, my wife's iced tea, a to-go cookie, and a plated cupcake without a tray. I was worried about dropping stuff, because it's a big space and I didn't have the best grip on my beer.  Then we hit the second problem: there was no inside seating because all the inside tables, including the six-top picnic tables, were taken up with single people working on laptops (so is this a coffee shop?). The only open inside tables were a couple of tree stump looking things with low benches and a patio chaise lounge. So we went outside on a day when it was 93 out and we'd just walked five blocks. Which is fine, I mean I don't like eating outside in Phoenix because of how hot it is, and I certainly don't think my wife and I would have ordered a hamburger and a chile verde potpie if we had known we were going to be outdoors.  Anyway, so we sit down. There are as few tables outdoors as indoors, because most of the outdoor seating is taken up by a long picnic table being used by a guy on a laptop again and a couple of benches in front of the fireplace that no one was using (again, is this place supposed to be a bar?).  Our food comes out. We had already decided, hot and annoyed as we were, that if the food was good, we'd be willing to overlook everything else. It wasn't good. My burger was fine, although the brioche bun was either based on a terrible recipe or, more likely, a day old roll, as it was very stale and tasted old. Additionally, the bun was about an inch bigger than the burger, so I had to eat through all that stale bread to get to the patie.  The chile verde potpie my wife had was less disappointing but still not good. The pork was well cooked and very tender, but the chile verde was very clearly red and heavily seasoned with chili powder. While there were some chopped green chiles floating in the mix, it mostly tasted like Easterner's idea of chili that has been cooked in a crock pot all day. Which isn't to say it was bad, far from it. This was very good chili, but don't call it chile verde if it isn't made out of green chiles, onions, and pork. Again, it's not that the dish is bad, it's just not what my wife wanted or thought she was getting.  Also because we were both so hot from our walk and sitting on the porch (in the sun, I might add), we didn't finish our meal. We never got water, nor did we ever see where we were supposed to get it. I'm guessing from other reviews that I'm supposed to get my own water, but given that we barely made it to our table as it is, I'm not sure how that would have happened.  All told, the food wasn't fresh or prepared as described, most of the seating was taken up by coffee shop patrons, and the experience was confusing. I think most of the problems with this place result from it trying to be a coffee shop AND a bar AND a restaurant, while not being particularly good at any of them. Moreover, there are much better coffee shops, bars, and restaurants downtown. That said, I think some of these problems could be fixed by better seating arrangements and clear signage. Also, I think the owners should seriously consider ditching the confusing counter service and just run the space as a normal restaurant.",

I visited and had a good experience, bragging about the hip vibe and food, especially the meat loaf and the chocolate espresso pudding.  I finally got my friend to agree to come out on a Sunday night for the community dinner which is a great deal.  Unfortunately, after driving down from Anthem just to have a bite, they no longer offered the meatloaf or the fabulous chocolate dessert I had twice before. Seems the chef/owner decides to change the menu any time.  That is his choice, but as a consumer it is my choice to patronize an establishment that I can depend on the be consistent.  I understand the idea that seasonal selections may cause the menu to change, but what is seasonal about meatloaf and a chocolate dessert?  On top of it, the dessert was changed for soft serve ice cream, which frankly was lackluster in taste and I can get at Dairy Queen or my local soft serve ice cream shop.  I won't be driving down into town over 40 miles another time to be embarrassed or disappointed.  Too bad the arrogance of this owner/chef outweighs impressing customers to be future return patrons.",

When I ordered the amazing young man, (I didn't catch his name) told me to give my macaroon a minute to adjust to room temperature for a better crack and flavor, I am so glad I listened!

    "text": "Phoenix Public Market combines many things a man like me loves: Fresh produce, non-processed food, all with a localized impact. I rarely eat at chain restaurants these days because of the high quality dishes local spots like Phoenix Public turns out.  PPMC is right at the top of my Local Eats list and is a perfect spot for a lazy Saturday or Sunday morning. SO... lets delve into it a bit deeper, shall we?  ~The Good~ Besides featuring local produce, meats and others in their menu, they also feature local items in a small shop in the center of the store. From the very beginning, the owners made it very clear this is a spot by Phoenicians, and for Phoenicians. I take pride in having my own place that features the best of my home, and boy are the dishes delightful, to say the least. The layout of this spot is trendy inside. You can pick a table or even snag the bench seating in the far corner of the restaurant. They have comparable seating along the bar area to sit and drink at. You may not notice it, but there is ample room out back flush with bench seating and a blown out wall where the bar extends out further.   As for food, the breakfast is to die for. I have tried numerous options, but the simplest item on the menu, Steel Cut Oats Risotto ($7.25) is my favorite. There is more than enough oats for 3-4 sittings in this bowl, which filled me up in about 5 minutes. My father opted for the Rooster Booster ($6.75) which he devoured along with a side of Crispy New Potatoes ($2.50). For lunch, my personal favorite is The Rachel ($8.50). This sandwich offers the eater a slice of roasted turkey, sauerkraut & coleslaw, all melted together on sourdough with Swiss cheese and dressed with a light and slightly sweet house dressing. The sides they offer all the way to the right of their big board are plentiful, and I chose a huge heaping bowl of broccoli which was sauteed lightly in butter. This added to my meal substantially and I was left finishing my dish...barely. Every meal here is properly portioned, and you get your money's worth in quality and freshness.   Really quick, the Happy Hour for drinks is superb; cocktails are made fresh on the spot for $5 each and taste delicious. The bartenders sling really good drinks here guys, you can come here anytime for food, but it's also a perfect treat for Happy Hour!  ~The Bad~ I can't think of anything bad... the portions you get aren't huge. We as a society are used to huge portions for small prices. Issue is, you are probably not getting your money's worth at such restaurants. Here you get what you paid for. Lines can be long at certain times of the day, especially for breakfast. So please plan your trip accordingly. They also do not have any rum drinks on the menu, so for my fellow rum lovers, we are SOL when it comes to the bar. It does give you a chance to try something different...but still that's disappointing.  ~The Downlow~ Overall this is the quintessential 5 star spot. They are trendy and hip, the location is stellar, the community involvement is top notch, their farmers market is a fun added touch, and most of all: their food is AMAZING! All of those reasons add up to 5 stars, and a very happy Jefe. I suggest this over most breakfast eateries in Phoenix. Come an enjoy, you won't be dissapointed!",

I have been here for dinner/evenings as well and they do a great job with their cocktails. I highly recommend stopping by if you're in the Downtown Phoenix area.",

    "text": "We had stopped by to grab a bite after catching an afternoon game at Chase Field following a Giants victory.  There are certain aspects of farm to table cooking at the Phx PMC that I appreciate.  This place was always busy when I've walked by to visit the vendors at the open air Public Market.    Sydney who took my order at the counter was extremely helpful and recommended the biscuits and chorizo gravy or the Chile Verde pot pie.  I went with the biscuits and chorizo gravy which was a hit.  Obviously not your  traditional dairy based gravy with milk and flour but I loved it and the bits of local Shreiner's chorizo gave it that kick!    The veggie frittata was pretty pedestrian but with that drizzle of pesto on top...now that was a nice touch!  I liked that a lot.    It's not on their menu but they serve fried chicken sourced locally part of their 3 course dinner and I would come back to try that!  Building community through food and a great spot in downtown Phoenix!  A solid 4 stars for the great service and a really good first meal that started off my weekend brunch.",

The server said they'd be out shortly. Another 10 minutes and inquired again. Said the same thing. This time the order came out but was delivered incorrectly to another table!!! So we had to wait again.Talk about disorganization. The only good thing that happened is that with our Yelp check-in we received a complimentary chocolate chip cookie which was delicious.

I always want to try something else, but I end up getting a pulled pork sandwich and a bowl of rice and beans.  When we checked in...we got a cookie.  I'll be back this week...and next week.  Just a chill, go to place for the local downtowner or the visiting tourist.  Breakfast is solid too, but we usually make it to happy hour!  If you see me...saw hello!",

We could not find free parking in downtown so we decided to stop by here for some beverage. I had the green tea which was perfectly refreshing and was unsweetened, just like how I like it. Free refills is a bonus too!  Then we came back to get some more beverage on the same day because we really like the vibe and interior of the place. This time I used the free cookie you get for checking in here on yelp!  Then came dinner time and we felt hungry from playing... we yelped other places for dinner, but we still ended up back to this place and I had the eat the rainbow and the lavender daiquiri which I both enjoyed! The eat the rainbow's portion was way too big I had to take it home. But this plate is really delicious, makes you want to eat your veggies!  Only con about this place was that they aren't really trying to advertise their happy hour menu. It was almost like they were hiding it and you had to ask for it. Also, customer service could improve a bit. Not saying they're not good but it could use some improvement.",

What you need to know: Phoenix Public Market Cafe is a loca restaurant (woohoo for supporting local businesses!!) what's even better is that they also try to support other local businesses with the ingredients they use and products they sell. For example, they provide Press Coffee and for the fruit salad we ate, some of the fruits were from seasonal and grown by local farmers  amazing right?!   Our Order:  House Pretzels-- The happy hour order was enough (comes with two pretzels), but what stands out is the dipping sauce. It's a jalapeno white cheddar sauce that I could literally eat spoonfuls of as I binge watch Netflix  BBQ Pork Sandwich-- Not too much bread, too much coleslaw, a lot of pulled pork (but that's never a bad thing). Perfect proportion of all ingredients and had extras to take home for lunch the next day.  AZ Burger-- \"I thought it was good\" \"I like the sauce on there\"  Michael's own words about his dish.  Four Peaks Peach Ale-- I know squat about beer, but thanks to the cashier who suggested this one. They had just had a beer training/sampling earlier that day and the way she described it was exactly how it tasted. Peachy and refreshing   Fruit Salad-- red and yellow watermelon, cantaloupe, and other stuff I don't even know the name of, but the combination of everything was delicious. It was topped with what I think was feta cheese. Sounds weird, right? Well, it taste amazing",

I had the tomato soup, roasted veggie plate with quinoa and a gigandor fruity rhubarb tart. I was super full at the end, the portions are very generous. And everything was so healthy! Well, maybe not the tart, but it was not too sweet so I didn't feel that guilty.   Good place to study, but you have to be conscientious of where the outlets are cuz they aren't at every table. And people definitely like to camp out near those outlets, FYI.   I recommend, would definitely return.",

I could only eat half, so for me it was a fair amount of food for the price. It was also one of their \"House Specialties.\"  There was a line for lunch and the space was packed too. It's a pretty popular place.   So to order you pick up a menu near the entrance and get in line which is straight ahead. OR if you just want coffee and a sweet you head to the barista and he'll ring you up, usually he doesn't have a line.  For the coffee bar, I've had the Chai and it was very good - rich, and flavorful! I've also had the cappuccino and it was sour, so not made well.   For baked goods, I've had the sugar cookie and it was rich, was more of a shortbread cookie. The carrot cake was okay, for $6 I don't think it was worth it. The chocolate chip cookie was crispy, not soft. On the other hand, the peanut butter cookie was soft.  Don't forget to check-in to receive your free cookie! (Get the sugar cookie!)  Happy Hour is everyday from 4 to 6 with food ranging from $5 to $7. So far I've had the \"Devil Fries\" which is a huge serving for $5. It's seasoned with parsley, garlic, and chili flakes, then topped with parmesan.   And for parking they have a covered lot to the West of the building or you can head North from their lot to the metered parking on the street, which I had to do since their lot was full.",

The reason for only three stars is due to service. This is my second time here and both times, I sat at the bar; which is full service. The rest of the seating is serverless by ordering at the counter and seating yourself while you wait for a food runner. I am fond of this model, but in this case, I sat in full service and received scant service.   The bartender seemed very busy, though the bar was not full. After ordering, the bartender did not speak to me until I was ready (and waiting) for my check. He didn't inquire about the food or my satisfaction, nor did he say goodbye. I can only concluded that his service was sub par because he has too many other responsibilities to attend to or he doesn't like his job. However, I can overlook the service because this is a really awesome place. I hope my next experience will be better.",

They have a 20% ASU student discount and a free cookie at check-in, so it's always a worthwhile option.   The wait is often a while for your food so don't come if you're in a rush for lunch. I came with friends who waited 30 min for their burgers when I got my veggie sandwich immediately. It can sometimes be hard to find a table, so I always split up and get someone to scout one out while someone else is waiting in line or ordering.   The menu is pretty large but not overwhelming. I think the veggie options have a good amount of flavor. I like the Roosevelt Row bagel if I'm not starving and the rice bowl if I am- it's a big portion and relatively little of it is rice.  The pretzels are my favorite on the appetizer menu if you want more traditional bar food. I've also heard good things about the burgers and the Cubano, but I like my veggie-laden options.  This is one of the few places in town you can get a golden milk latte (made with tumeric and other spices instead of coffee or tea). It's delicious but overpriced for the very small cup you get. I'll keep satisfying those cravings at home, sadly.  I haven't explored the cocktail menu but they have a lot of signature concoctions. I have had delicious (virgin) specialty lemonade so that bodes well.",

    "text": "The reviewers are so right about the incredible customer service at Phoenix Public Market Cafe. As we entered, the bartender greeted us and explained where we could find the menu and order. I believe we were lead to our seats and given menus (you can find water cups near the beverages on the side). And I noticed that someone had reserved an area for a small 40th birthday gathering.    Back to the menu, Happy Hour is from 4-6pm everyday. Regarding the FOOD portion, it includes: 1. House Pretzel $5  2. Downtown Devil Fries $5 3. Chips, Salsa and Guacamole $5 4. Sweet and Spicy Wings $8   Happy Hour for DRINKS is from 4pm till close, also everyday.   We had the Pot Pie (Green Chile Pork Stew) $12.50, which my brother enjoyed. My significant other ordered the Downtown Devil Fries, which he liked. Along with the Sweet and Spicy Wings, which he said was good but I agreed that the portion looked a little small. If I was rating the restaurant on just the food, I would say it's close to a 4/5 but there's just something about great service that makes everything taste better.  The atmosphere was pretty relaxed, slight bar and hipster vibes. There were a few people on the side bench area using their laptops (I assume there is wifi?). It seems like a great place to grab a casual lunch, dinner, or drinks with some friends.    Overall, we had a fantastic experience. The cashiers gave great advice when I asked for help with choosing a cookie (was debating between the chocolate chip versus the ballerina). The Ballerina cookie contains chocolate chips, nuts, and sea salt --which I thought was unique and everyone would enjoy (but I learned it's not for everyone and I should have gone with the safer chocolate chip option). I was also told their peanut butter cookie was great if you are into that.  TIPS 1. They offer 20% off with a student ID  2. Happy Hour is 4-6PM for food and 4pm-close for drinks 3. Check-in on Yelp for a free cookie!",

The food is excellent, the beer is cold and everything is reasonably priced, the location is for the most part convenient.   Why three stars, instead of the five which are so close within reach?   The staff runs around in a disorganized mess, all of them conferencing and telling one another what to do, very few of them doing anything efficiently.   The owner should fire their manager(s) and hire some with a birds-eye view and a vision for service.    A mess, a delicious, delightful mess.   Oh yeah, the Cubano Sandwich is super good and worth the wait!",

I had the Cinderella I think it's called. Sooooo good!! (Tip: make sure you show them the special offer at the time you pay since it is with purchase. I told my friend about it after she already paid and she had to buy something else in order to get the free cookie.)  I ordered a quinoa bowl to be healthy and a latte. You get a number stand and they bring your food to your table. We found some long tables outside to accommodate for our large group.   Based on the other food that our group ordered, everyone liked what they got. Always a good indication of the quality of the food when a variety of people who order different things are also satisfied.",

The bun is huge so it was a bit dry, but I would recommend getting a side salsa or something to go with. The chorizo biscuits and gravy is yummy, it reminds me of a warm bowl of chili. Salads are pre-made in the cooler so I wasn't a big fan of that. Dirty chai came from the bar and it was awesome, great taste compared to most places and the bartender was super sweet. They have outdoor seating too. And how could I forget about the homemade cinnamon rolls made from scratch down to the buttercream frosting tower on top of it!!!!!! Can't wait to go back and try some of their rotisserie chicken for lunch.",

I had high hope for, but was let down . The Cuban was not pressed down while cooking, there was a cosher dill pickle the size of a toothpick and they used stone ground mustard instead of the conventional yellow. Then must of my small bowl of French Fries where little prices the size of a pea. They did redeam them selves by making the best Cowgirl cookie we've ever eaten. I would come again if in the area to try other items on there menu.",

The wait staff are knowledgable about the menu and the menu reflects what is fresh about the foods!  Some personal favorites include the Devil's Mess for breakfast and the Sonoran Salad (add chicken!!! (it's their rotisserie chicken)). When they have specials, definitely go for it! That's always going to be their freshest and most creative option.",

The pulled pork sandwich is the best one I've had in Phoenix (AND it's part of their $5 happy hour!). The rice bowl is amazing if you're craving something satisfying and healthy that's not a salad. Vegetarian nachos are sooo tasty, even for a non-vegetarian.......   UPDATE: I am updating my review from 4 stars to 5.... because my one disappointment was the Lee Trevino cocktail, which (for some reason) became barely spicy.... but it has been fixed!  It is spicy again! And so delicious! Everything is so incredibly yummy!",

Dominic, the bar manager will make an effort to remember regulars faces which is always an amazing thing to me. No fake people here.  Don't even get me started on the pretzels with beer cheese too.   The only thing that would make this place even better is a rotating menu... maybe change it up seasonally or add a few weekly specials. The menu gets a little boring after so many visits.",

It's a great place to grab breakfast or a pastry (seriously, the pop tarts will change your life), a healthy and quick lunch, or even a coffee or drink at the bar. Although the salads are pricey, they're packed with fresh, flavorful and largely local vegetables. They also serve small fresh juices, including one with red pepper and Fresno chilis that has a bit of a kick. At lunchtime, you can simply grab and go with these items. Don't forget to add a homemade nutter butter or cookies and cream - the baked goods are awesome. You could even bring work - there's free wifi and it's not unusual to see people posting up with their laptops. The friendly staff won't mind if you set up shop.",

I used to take many of my clients out here just so they could soak in the vibe.   I've been here a few times within the past few months and each time my experience gets worse. Today really took the cake.  I came in to order for take out. The place wasn't busy and I even got a parking spot out front! I put 20 minutes on the meter not imaging how my regular order of the Roosevelt which is basically avocado on toast could take any longer.   I placed my order and waited, and waited and waited and waited.   37 minutes after the transaction time on my receipt my to go order comes out. The girl who handed it to me was incredibly rude and the box of food was wide open!   To really sprinkle the sugar on top I walked outside to discover that not only did I get terrible service and wait forever, I had also received a parking ticket!   I will not be returning here.

I like that they shaved off the top of the baguette so the meat to bread ratio is consistent. Our group also got a Caesar salad with chicken. It looked really good because it had rotisserie chicken on it, not that usual disgusting cold grilled chicken that is usually on such a salad. Also had a margarita type cocktail - friendly and quick service at the bar, drink was good mix of flavors, but was a little sweet and light on the liquor for my taste. We also got some rolls for Xmas day and they were amazing. I like that they have the food counter separate from the Bar so boozers like me don't have to wait with the food line before getting a drink. Tip: get your drink first! Then stand in the food line.",

Neither of us could eat more than half.  Also, the atmosphere is just perfect for a Phoenix morning. I'm eager to go back and try more!",

    "text": "Downtown. Sister Property, St Francis. I ordered the chopped mediterranean salad 8.25. Greens, garbanzo beans, shaved red onion, olives, Crow's Dairy feta, sherry vinaigrette, plus sliced chicken from the rotisserie. I think that was an additional 3.    The beer was Mother Road \"Gold Road\" Kolsch Style Ale, on draft $5. Pours a copper color. The flavor is crisp, lightly hoppy and a pretty clean, very drinkable brew from Mother Road Brewing Company, Flagstaff.   I sat at the bar and as usual, was chatting away with the staff and customers. I asked Marena my server, who btw is very cool, if she knew anything about the history of this early 1900's, Phoenix Red Brick building. Then I hear, seated next to me, down 4 or 5 bar stools, a man speak up, saying I'm a historian.   Chef Dennis McGarry, a historian that lives at the Westward Ho began to speak about the area in the 1930's. This building was a used car dealership. Of course there were the Buicks, the Dodges, Fords and Chevrolet's. Oldsmobile's, Packard's and Plymouth's. This whole area on Central was automobile dealerships and resale. And the Phoenix Public Market Cafe was a showroom of used automobiles.  Chef Dennis invited me to tour with him, the Westward Ho. He lives in a suite that Jacky Gleason registered. As a side note, I asked \"what are you eating?\" He replied \"the pulled pork sandwich and it's pretty good.\" He ate it all and got a slice of the French Silk Pie to go. I ate a cupcake.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.phxpublicmarket.com%2F&s=9203df11e0077eda1edb540a5b6bbac4ba4aa83f4839e53d7ca6e8804c0c993b\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">phxpublicmarket.com</a>",

I got a free cookie for checking in on Yelp which was cool but my \"homemade\" Oreo was on the odd side.

I used to shop here when it was the little grocery store, and the way they redid the space is SEXY!  I just love all the space and brightness, the brick walls and the wood elements.    I got a tour of the kitchen, which is huge!  The rotisserie (while I don't eat the birds) is sweet, and it gives the cafe a really delicious smell. You have the option of going up to the counter and ordering or they have a full service coffee bar. They also serve up beers and wine on tap for the full \"bar\" experience.  Breakfast is served from 7am-3pm and lunch/dinner is served from 11am-10pm.  For brekkie, I had the Chickpea Pancakes!!! They were very good, topped with roasted pecans, bananas and agave.  I paired that with a nice cup of Cartel coffee and chowed the eff down.    In addition to the food and drinks, they also have a little section of wares in the middle of the cafe.  I saw some great stuff (books, soaps, wine bottles turned into drinking glasses, bow ties, etc.)  I like how they have incorporated little bits of St. Francis to their menu, including: the baguettes, the rice bowl and the Del Real sandwich.  The menu has lots of rustic/farm-to-table/fresh items on there, and I can't wait to come back all of the time!!  They just opened recently, but I would HIGHLY recommend getting your backsides down as soon as possible, because they are sure to blow up soon.",

    "text": "Ate breakfast here this morning with my boyfriend, and the place was hoppin' -- a nice sight to see downtown, somewhere other than Matt's. Was a little confused as to where to order at first, but a man near the front (a manager possibly?) directed us to the back to order. From there we found a seat at the bar, as all the tables were occupied.  Decor is really gorgeous -- I feel like the space maintains elements from the old market and cafe, but it still has its own look. Very clean lines, lots of wood, and roomy.   On to the food. I ordered the frittata without onions, and a side of potatoes, while the boyfriend ordered a bagel. The frittata was huge -- it was the size of a flat dinner plate -- but light and fluffy. The pesto was really lovely and gave the eggs a well-needed flavor. My biggest complaint is that the frittata and its accompanying bread was pretty heavily doused in olive oil. With the eggs it was a pleasant taste, but the bread was so greasy I couldn't bear to finish it. The side of potatoes, however, were so bomb. Salted on the skin, and soft and fluffy on the inside, they were cooked like all potatoes should be.   Boyfriend liked his bagel, and the bite I had was pretty tasty. The bread had a nice crunch and wasn't too dense.   I've been looking for a restaurant downtown to frequent more regularly since the one food item I love at Carly's gets a little redundant to eat, and I would love for this restaurant to fill that void. Here's to hoping that they get the olive oil issues under control, and until then I'll be back for lunch and dinner!",

The staff doesn't seem to understand how to handle hosting duties and it would be easiest to just continue the way it is the rest of the day.  They have excellent coffee and I wish they did all day breafast. I'd just avoid it in the evening. Unless you can get a seat at the bar and very service.  They also give the tiniest amount of ketchup possible with fries and potatoes. I know its not ' classy' to have bottles on the table, but it is to have buckets of silverware?",

Egg & Bacon Sandwich with Avocado - not bad but the bacon was slimy and hardly cooked at all. Potatoes - these were steamed and flavorless. Lox Bagel - Good but $15 really?

Come chill and kick it with your amigos on the patio and enjoy your drinks during the cool Arizona winter, but don't be expecting to be blown away by the food.",

There was no wait and maybe 10 people in the main room. We were greeted and seated right away. The decor is wonderful, with cute, real votive candles on the tables.  We both had the 3 course dinner for $12.99, and it was amazing! The salad was fresh greens with just enough tasty dressing. You choose between 3 entrees, we both had the BBQ platter. The chicken and pork was crazy good! It was so tender and fresh. It came with fries, shaved red cabbage, and corn bread. They were all perfect portioned and tasty. For dessert you get a yummy cup of organic ice cream. I can't believe quality and the amount of food you get for only $13!! I had a $5 HH Sangria and it was very good. They must marinate the fruit a very long time.  My boyfriend had draft blonde, light and refreshing. Their Sunday HH is 3pm- close. Nice location, near downtown Phoenix, with their own parking lot. The service was great as well, our waiter checked on us frequently and we waited maybe 10 min for our meal. You definately can't go wrong with this place.",

I wasn't expecting MBB quality, but I was expecting good quality.  I got the Rooster Booster, green tea, and a raspberry lemon bar.  The place is quite big and you walk up, place your order, a number is given to you and you sit and wait for the food.  The patio is nice, but we went on a rainy day so it was not so nice (obviously).  Our food took forever to get to us (at least 20 minutes).  Overeasy eggs, bacon, toast, potatoes...How long could it really take to make?  We had to get up and ask the cashier up front which we found out was at the front waiting to get picked up by someone to bring to us.    So, the food was ok but it wasn't spectacular.  The green tea was not good.  The raspberry lemon bar was really good.  The place is definitely a cute one especially if you want to go there to read a book or study.  I definitely don't plan on coming back.",

    "text": "Every time I come to Phoenix, I feel as if I have found my go-to lunch spot but Phoenix Public Market Cafe has set the bar too high.   First off, awesome decor and interior design. They allow their customers to choose how casual or proper they'd like to be with their picnic bench style, coffee table and bench or regular table arrangements. A seating arrangement for every soul and mood. I liked the barbed wire bathroom art too - very ranchero.   Food: lentil and cocunut milk soup was awesome if you want a vegetarian version of Thai Tom Kha soup. Regardless of weather, soup always warms the soul. I also ordered The Rachel and that was another great sandwich with their delicious rotisserie chicken. Swiss cheese, red cabbage and that Russian sauce is always a great mix but then add some sourdough and I am sold. As a bread snob, I loved the sourdough and its toasted perfection.   A++ for a great lunch under $10-15",

There's lots of locals and travelers due to the proximity of downtown. Our waiter was Niko and he was fabulous. Knew the menu well and was super friendly...another smiling face obviously enjoying his job. Thank you!  The food was great. We started with the house pretzel and downtown double fries. The house pretzel cheese is very original...we really liked their spin of it. I had the rotisserie chicken and was quite impressed. Very juicy. My partner had the southwestern pasta and was raving about it.   Then we had a cookie spread...we basically tried them all. Nothing short of amazing. I can't really pick my favorite. Peanut butter and peanut butter buttercream frosting, sugar cookie with sprinkles, 3 different macaroons, a white chocolate oatmeal cookie, chocolate chip cookie and a corn cookie with frosting (it had a kick!). Best. Peanut. Butter. Cookie. Ever.   Pricing was very reasonable. I was expecting a higher bill. I look forward to recommending this new find to friends and family. Unique cafe. I look forward to making a special trip just to try the breakfast menu.",

    "text": "Phoenix Public Market: where Fresh, Local Conversation and food meet. While I have only been here a small handful of times, I can see this quickly becoming my go-to hangout AND chow down venue.   First, let me note that the atmosphere alone for those of us who like casual, urban settings - you will find great solice in this wonderful downtown gem. I sit here with my Iced Chai, and my Devils Mess (A fantastic mess of eggs, farm veg, local made chorizo, and a crunchy slab of home made 9 grain) and my trusty laptop, I have NEVER felt more relaxed in a Downtown cafe. While it is a very nice, hip feeling place chanalling what I'd like to call a slice of Portland in Phoenix, I do not feel the posh annoying stares of Hipsters, and Buisness men. I feel like I belong here, which I think is what they are going for. There is a lovely mix of community seating, and tables - the outdoor seating if truly beautiful - although I have yet to sit out there. Phoenix Public Market Cafe' has combined Urban, Industrial, and Classic Downtown Charm all into one place - AND I AM HOOKED.   I find myself invested in the sucess of this place. I really do hope downtown is good for them, I feel they will thrive in this location - being a very short half a block walk from ASU downtown campus.   Now to get to the part we all love - THE FOOD. Again as stated previous, I got a Iced Chai and The Devils Mess. The Chai was some of the best I have ever had, and I do consider myself a bit of a Chai snob - It's the only drink I ever buy from a coffee shop or restaurant. This was creamy, but not to sweet and did quench your thirst. PERFECT CHAI BLISS.  The Eggs were really something special, fluffy, but the cilantro and hot peppers added the perfect complement.  The 9 grain was fresh, you could tell it had been made this morning, and was crunchy from grilling on the flat-top. All around some of the BEST breakfast I've had in Downtown Phoenix.   I WILL BE BACK VERY VERY SOON!",

Pimms, basil, lime, cucumbers.. oh hell, I don't even remember what's in it.  But it was GOOD. The drink is both sweet and sour, which for me is excellent.  I'm not a fan of sweet drinks at all.   We were served a pork rotisserie sandwich served in ciabatta.   Wow.  The aioli was a wonderful final touch.  My favorite dish was the melon gazpacho. I was told it was usually served as a special and not part of the regular menu, so if you see it; don't be skurred, order it!  We were given gift cards to come back and I'm hoping that the gelato sandwich is there. This was served on corn cakes, which seems odd, but it worked!  What I love about this place is the fact that the chef buys his goods next door at the market and figures out the menu accordingly. The menu , even the drinks, are made with fresh local ingredients. You can sincerely taste the difference.  The $5 happy hour specials are fantastic and I will definitely come back.",

They had lots of fresh ingredients and were delicious. Normally, though, I get the Eat the Rainbow salad, which is a dream for anyone wanting a super-healthy meal (not considering the included dipping sauces of course, but they are yummy).

This is a great place for out-of-towners to visit.   Over the course of 5 days I ordered: The Chino Salad 2 Kale Salads The Lentil Curry Coconut Soup A Brown Rice Bowl with Veggies The Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie A Corn Cookie An Oreo Cookie Six different Macarons  I've been sampling macarons across the country since I was first introduced to them in 2008, and let me tell you. These guys just topped my list for the title of favorite macarons in the US. SO GOOD!   My next favorite item I ordered was the lentil curry coconut soup. It has such a nice delicate flavor and is perfectly comforting for a cold night.",

They have a good selection of beers on tap, there almost always seems to be a Deschutes beer available which Im keen on being a northwest girl so thumbs up there!  The patio is lovely to sit on and enjoy the az weather. I was there one evening for dinner and they had live music which was just fabulous!  If you show your ASU Id you get a discount on your check. I really hope they start offering discounts for all state universities (Ahem, U of A!) especially since downtown now has UA campus. I would be so pleased as a fellow wildcat :)",

The staff is super friendly and they let you sample the beer they have on tap before you buy!  The food was great.  I got the pork chile verde pot pie, and it was delicious. Just eating the crust of that pie will hit your calorie limit for the day, but damn its worth it.  I wish phoenix had more places like this.  Being able to walk around the farmers market afterwards was a definite bonus.",

    "text": "Quite a few people I know have been to Phoenix Public Market so we decided to go in to grab some snacks / an early dinner. I didn't realize they have happy hour everyday which was nice to see since it's not very common! It had quite a few menu items as well as drinks on it. I'm not certain if we didn't order quite the right things or what, but we left disappointed with what we got.  Our order consisted of devil fries, a pulled pork sandwich, and pretzels to share. The food came out fairly quickly but unfortunately only the pretzels came out piping hot. The cheese fondue that came with the pretzels was on the lukewarm side as were the fries which made them incredible soggy. The pulled pork sandwich was at a decent temperature but it was pretty dry. I wish it had more of the sauce or something on it. In addition to the fondue being lukewarm, it was also weirdly gritty. I think if it were warmer, it probably would've helped the consistency. The fries were also overly salty, and the dipping sauces they were served with tasted weird. One was plain ketchup, that obviously tasted fine, and one other sauce which was a bit spicy was okay. There was one however that tasted weirdly smokey. I'm not sure exactly what was in it but we decided to just leave it alone.  The service also wasn't that great. It's not a sit-down place, just order at the counter and they deliver the food to you, but I saw employees who worked there asking others if they were doing okay, needed anything, etc. We didn't need anything so it was fine. A-ok on the food. I'm not sure we'd be inclined to recommend this place to others.",

Ambiance: It was really cute and had a good mix of small tables, long benches, smaller couches and outdoor seating. There's some cute local(?) knick knacks for sale near the front. You order at the counters and they serve it to you there or bring your food over to you. Our plan was just to get coffee, but as soon as we saw the check-in bonus, we ended up with snacks as well.   Coffee: I went with my go-to black cup of house drip coffee. It was smooth, and just a touch acidic. Not the absolute best coffee I've had in the Valley, but a good cup. It was decently priced, and was a great accompaniment to my cookie.  Cookie: I got the oatmeal vegan apricot cookie. It was pretty dense, but very tasty. I was looking for something that had a good breakfast cookie feel, and while this didn't quite hit that spot, it was a good cookie in it's own right. I really want to try the corn one next time.  Service: The ladies at both counters were really helpful. I wished they'd told us about the 20% off for ASU students deal though. It wouldn't have made a huge difference with our drinks, but when you're a student, every little bit counts you know? Good to know for next time!",

    "text": "It's always a pleasant experience to walk around the Downtown Phoenix Market on the two days a week that it's open, but then there's the Phoenix Public Market Cafe, which is open EVERY DAY from 7 AM to 10 PM!  Whether for a meal or a coffee on my own or with others, visiting the cafe is a great place for people watching, mingling, and of course, enjoying good food and drinks.  My own personal favorite reason to stop by is meeting up with friends for brunch on the weekends or on a day off.  During extended breakfast hours (until 3), you can enjoy everyday breakfast combos like the Rooster Booster or more creative dishes like the Devil's Mess, which is convenience being right next to ASU (Downtown Phoenix Campus).  I've also enjoyed sandwiches and chicken dishes before.    There is always plenty of parking though you may need to get creative if you're parking at a meter, street parking, or a parking lot.  Then again, there's always the Downtown Phoenix Market parking (though I've only parked there when going to the market).    As for seating, there are limited seats, but it's fun to sit with strangers at the longer tables, which are in a sense community spaces.  Make a new friend!!  Note specials such as happy hour (daily from 3-6 pm for food and 3-close for drinks).  Also, if you check in on Yelp, you sometimes get a cookie!",

I usually get the Del Real, it is a veggie sandwich with goat cheese. It is unbelievably delicious. It is my goal to try everything on the menu here, but I seem to get stuck on this sandwich. Delicious food, good price, I highly recommend!!",

We ordered the Titos Cubano and Pork Chile Verde Pot Pie.  Homemade Baugette was on the crunchy side but the overall sandwich was good.  The Green Chile Pot Pie was excellent,  would highly recommend this dish. On the smaller side but the beef and Green Chile is a winner. I am a big green chili lover and this combination really works well with their excellent pie crust. This is one of their signature dishes so you have to try it.",

I love the free parking they offer and it's covered which is a huge plus. They offer a variety of foods which range from breakfast, lunch and dinner. Most recently I had their quiche and the lox bagel. The quiche was moist, rich in flavor and definitely a repeat for me. The Lox bagel was alright but the price was much higher than anywhere else I have purchased a Lox bagel. I have had other for cheaper that are on par if not better. I would suggest going for a more hearty meal when you visit here to get the best bang for your buck.  Seating can be tricky at times, especially during the lunch rush. If you don't mind sitting with some other people working on their computers, then there's room for everyone. I would suggest trying here since they have a large variety to offer. I just wish the prices were a little more reasonable...",

    "text": "Downtown Phoenix has so many places that serve delicious foods. This is one of them. A little more pricey compared to your average breakfast spot, but it's expected considering you're in the heart of PHX. Having said that, the food is worth every penny. Walking in, we weren't sure if we waited to be seated, but then I noticed menus in a stand, and realized you just skim the menu and the walk towards the back register to place an order and find a seat. There was no wait, and the place was lively.  I had the breakfast sandwich Flanched Flarney Garney--not sure what the name means, and even though the name annoys me, the ingredients were fresh, the bread was perfection, and a little tobasco sauce enhanced its flavor. Came with a side of pickle and slice of watermelon. It was very filling. Hubby had the Devils Mess--the tortilla was delicious. It was almost, dare I say it, maybe just as good as Los Hermanos tortillas from Superior. Daughter had the grilled cheese-she said it was yummy and the bread was very soft and flavorful. We all split a ballerina cookie for dessert and it was unlike any cookie I've had, surprisingly awoke my sleeping sweet tooth. We will gladly be back!",

    "text": "We love St. Francis. We're regulars there, and when we heard about the new place, we went to give it a try. We liked the vibe and the location is fine for us -- we're about five minutes away. Should be a popular place on First Fridays! Nice menu, free seltzer water on tap, and you pay up front and they bring your meal to the table. It's a good start.   But there were a few things wrong, at least in our first attempt. I'll go back, because I know this place is still working out the kinks. First off, I'm allergic to eggs, and I told them that at the order counter (but admittedly, the conversation was more about the mayonnaise in the coleslaw). They served my pulled pork with an egg bun, unfortunately. The sandwich is about $10, so it's pricey to have as the only thing on the plate. Should be fries with it at that price.  One of us got a great looking baked sweet potato that really was consumed quickly. Another person ordered a salad, and it came with a whole lot of ingredients that weren't listed in the menu. It had to go back a couple of times -- they really need to either make it the way it is listed on the menu, or advise those who order that it has a few \"bonus items\" included (\"The Chino,\" $10.50).   The atmosphere is nice and the management is, like St. Francis, very accommodating. I can't give this particular $40 investment anything more than two stars, but I'll be back because I like their potential and the owners were so successful elsewhere that they ought to be able to fix these issues. (And to St. Francis folks, please, please, please . . . Don't put eggs in your buns, or at least offer an alternative, because you do this at both restaurants. Good fresh bakery items don't have to have eggs.)",

    "text": "I am a total food critic; do it right, make it unique, and charge a fair price and you will win me over as a repeat customer.....  Unfortunately, Phoenix Public Market Cafe fell short today when I stopped in for lunch.  I ordered the BBQ chicken sandwich. Was served a single sandwich about 15 min later on a large dinner plate...no side. The roll was the highlight of the otherwise \"OK \" sandwich. $10.95 was over priced for too little, \"can get it anywhere\" food. A better sandwich with a side for less is served more quickly at many other downtown eateries.  My friend ordered salad and soup. Again a very small portion of salad at a price about 3 dollars higher than other downtown eateries.  The wait staff were fairly friendly (though I was never asked  how my sandwich was) but obviously unpolished. The salads and soup were delivered with the server's thumbs buried in the bowls - GROSS.  Also observed the cashier handling money then putting unwrapped straws into drinks without washing his hands in between. The bakery case was full or over-sized delicious cookies, but I decided to skip after observing the other food handling issues.  The place has only been open a short while and at lunchtime was fairly busy; unfortunately indoor seating was insufficient so not everyone could find seating indoors on a 98 degree day.  In short, small portions of  \"nothing special\" food at prices about 3 to 4 dollars per person too expensive and some kitchen/management execution issues (too slow and unsanitary food handling) that need resolved.  I would highly recommend you choose one of the many other downtown eateries for your lunch or brown-bag it.",

The service is really bad.  It took 20 minutes to get a glass of water.  Our waiter kept forgetting that we were even there.  He would walk by with water but it was evidently for another table that arrived after us.  We did not receive our food for an hour.  Not a place I will go back to.  They may have good happy hour prices on drinks but its not for me.  They need a new kitchen staff and at least one new waiter.  I ordered the pot pie that was very crisp and even burnt on one side.  I don't see why all the good reviews unless people like spending their time in this place without getting much service.  The only thing good was the atmosphere (other than the noise level) and the hostess.",

I work in the service industry and could not imagine giving paying customers that terrible of service. When I went to the counter initially I was greeted by two men who did not say hello and their expression made me question whether I should get drinks from them in the first place. After I ordered my 2 coffee drinks I went with the cup for regular coffee to the canisters that hold the coffee while one of the bartenders worked on my latte (the coffee was for my boyfriend). The canisters were all just about empty and although I'm pretty sure they saw me trying to squeeze coffee out the bartenders did nothing. I filled half the cup with decaf because I wanted to avoid these annoyed looking guys who made me feel uncomfortable and inconvenient. When I went for the creamer it was empty and I contemplated just forgetting the coffee but decided to ask them for more. The whole coffee area was a disaster. My boyfriend had arrived by that point and felt the same vibes as me. The latte had taken a little longer than expected (which is fine) but because they never asked my name or gave me a number I went up to ask if the drink on the counter was mine and the bartender just laughed at me and said no. How the heck am I supposed to know if it's my drink!! They just set it there without saying anything! The whole experience felt condescending and uncomfortable which is a darn shame because the place is so cute and the farmers market is AWESOME! I'm sure the food is good but I would never go back in to try it or recommend it because of that experience. I definitely haven't been to a lot of \"hospitality\" based establishments where I feel like I just threw my money in the garbage.",

It was delicious and came with a slice of watermelon and a pickle. The (very adventurous) 3 year old had the curried coconut lentil soup and while he was more interested in the free corn cookie we got for checking in on Yelp (also delicious) he actually seemed to like it quite a bit. I snagged a bite and it was pretty good! The coconut and the curry balanced eachother well, nothing was too overwhelming. The only downside was the lack of indoor seating. Luckily the patio was shady and had misters. I will definitely be back to try some more of the menu!",

I think that a lot of the items are store bought (almond butter, guacamole, hummus) and I probably could've made them better myself at home. The bread on the almond butter sandwich seemed stale. Not horrible, just meh. However, the ambiance was lovely, and the staff was friendly. We got a free cookie with the yelp check in, and my husband thoroughly enjoyed the chocolate chip!",

This place used to be a little market & cafe but they really did a great job reconstructing it. The patio area has sleek, long wooden benches and tables along with a fireplace and a bar area. And, it's dog-friendly!  I have dined here a few times and haven't been disappointed. I've tried the pesto frittata, beans & rice bowl, the open-faced veggie melt and the vegetarian Del Real sandwich (my favorite veggie sandwich everrrr). My boyfriend LOVES their Flanched Flarney Garney sandwich filled with bacon, eggs and avocado. Their bread is fantastic and you can take home a loaf, too.   They have a fantastic happy hour that we've been meaning to take advantage of. It's every day from 3-close and their five rotating draft selections look great. Oh, and their coffee is divine.  Great food, generous portions, lovely ambiance, perfect patio and a friendly staff. We're hooked.",

We arrived around 5:00pm and were seated outside promptly. However, it took almost 20 minutes for a waiter to come to our table, and this was after waiving our hands several times trying to get a waiter's attention.  The happy hour specials are pretty good - $5 drafts, cocktails, and wine. I stuck with Orange Blossom to go with my pulled pork sandwich. The sandwich was good, although a bit small for the hefty price (almost $10 with no sides). During our three hours at the Cafe, we constantly had to flag down our waiter when we needed drink refills.  I love the food, drink selection, and atmosphere of the Cafe. Its location is perfect. But the service leaves much to be desired, and the food menu could use a few more options. But overall, this is one of my favorite hangout spots in downtown Phoenix.",

When the weather is right, the outdoor patio is very enjoyable and gives a bit of seclusion from downtown.   The only thing I wouldn't mind seeing improved is the service, or at least getting a better understanding of the service setup. Unless you're sitting at the bar, it's order at the register and they bring it to you. If you're at the bar, you get a bit more service. Not a huge deal, and it makes sense now that I've been a few times, but I could see it being confusing.   I'm glad to see this space seeming to do well and look forward to being back. Besides, the video of the plants growing is really interesting and a fun way to reconnect with nature in an urban environment.",

I eat here often enough and tried numerous items off the menu, to say the food is great.  It has a lovely patio and the 'bar' is indoor/outdoor (*pet and kid friendly).

When I brought this to attention of staff I was not given an apology and the replacement food was inedible as well.  The eggs were under cooked (barely over easy when I requested over medium), the bacon was a lump and the plate was wet, making everything soggy. It took over 20 minutes to get my replacement meal when it took less than 10 to get out the original dish. Management did not follow up to make sure everything was addressed. I have eaten at the Public Market many times since it opened and have noticed a significant decrease in the quality. The last time I got a salad to go it had bugs in it!!!

Loved how all the ingredients and flavors came together. Watch out for a spicy kick! 2) Chick pea pancakes: Sounds weird, but they were so fluffy and tasty! I would have never guessed it's made from chick peas! There was a subtle grainy texture which I loved! It was really good! 3) frittata: I would have called this more of a layer of egg with cheese and veggies on top, rather an a quiche. I imagine frittatas more like quiches but without the crust, but here, they make it a little differently than that. I was a little thrown off, but it still tasted amazing, so who cares?  Ambiance:  Very hipster and eco-friendly feel to this place. Gets busy if you come later on during the day!  Service:  Order at the front/cashier and bus yourself. The workers there were friendly and nice!  Price:  For the quality and taste of the food, I think they are very reasonably priced.

I must admit it was my first time at the cafe, but I had attended Foodtruck Friday many a times during my ASU Cronkite days. I was excited to finally try out the menu!   I loved the pork verde pot pie - it was kind of on the spicy side, but I paired my lunch with a nice apple cider to wash it down. That's right! This cafe has a bar! Cool points again!  The vibe of the whole restaurant was like your moms kitchen back home, but run by very friendly, energetic and outgoing employees.  After finishing my lunch I was walking around taking some pictures of the Phoestivus event and some of the morning employees were having lunch. One of them named Lauren (same name!) struck up a conversation with me and offered me a bite of a croissant she just bought from the bakery. Although I was extremely full from my meal, she talked me into it! The croissant was the best thing I've ever eaten. It was flaky, buttery and delicious I was so thankful she gave me a chance to try it!  SUGGESTION: The only thing I could suggest is to have access to more restrooms during events like Phoestivus. Maybe rentals outside? There was a long line all night at the bathrooms and there was much confusion about the unisex option with customers. I heard many gentlemen say to everyone in line, \"I'm just going to go find the men's room,\" as they cut the line. It was a tad bit frustrating.   Besides that one suggestion, which is probably only an issue during these kind of events, I loved the Phoenix Public Market Cafe and can't wait to go back to try something new and fresh!",

I've been quite a few times during busy times during lunch and off times such as 2/3 pm.    I've had the bagel sandwich, Del Rio, a couple of salads, and the rice bowl.  All have been pretty good.  The Del Rio sandwich sometimes has lacked all the ingredients listed on the menu.  The bagel sandwich (one bagel with hummus and the other with guacamole) is huge.  It is not good leftover though.  The rice bowl has an interesting taste and is pretty filling.   I've ordered side vegetables which are tasty.    The baked goods have been hit or miss. The dark chocolate cookie looked good but had no flavor whatsoever.  The carrot cake cookie sandwich was very good though.   The service is sometimes good, sometimes really rude.  The cashiers are sometimes rude.  Sometimes they are nice.  The last few times I went, the cashiers act like I'm annoying them by just being there and ordering food.  Almost every time I've been, something has been left off my order. The last time something was missing, the guy brought it and just slammed it down on the table. Thanks!",

The rotisserie chicken is cooked to perfection, and amazingly juicy.   One of my (I know I am a werido) favorite things about this place is that they have sparkling water ON TAP. LOOOOVVE this.   The cinnamon roll.... to die for.   The farmers market on Saturdays is so cool too.   Do yourself a favor. Check out this gem in Downtown Phoenix!",

We had the Chino salad (kinda like a Chinese chicken salad) and it was super tasty!  The one thing that I couldn't get over though was that this place looks and feels a lot like LGO, but I found out they aren't connected in any way shape or form.  Not sure if they used the same interior designer or just ripped off their look and feel, but it was surreal to be there and realize I wasn't in Arcadia.  Other than that oddity, the market is casual, and has great food and drink options, so I plan to come back next time I am in downtown for lunch!",

From coffee to cocktails to delicious num nums, this place has it all at a price point you really can't argue with. It's a great place to go for dinner, a low-key reading session, or for a quick iced tea after perusing the Saturday Farmer's Market. My only wish is that they had more vegetarian options, but I'm sure that's on the horizon.  I recommend the veggie rice bowl. Offer to be upcharged for extra veggies. You won't regret it! The black bean soup is also delicious. The Flarney Garney is a serious commitment to napping later.",

I noticed this place taking great pride with their vegetables. I had a medley of baby carrots and roasted brussell sprouts to go along with my 1/2 rotisserie chicken and french fries. Great taste, good flavors and wonderful presentation.  Lets not forget my choice of a free cookie with a \"check in\". Chocolate chip seemed too safe so I went with the corn cookie. Yes it's a cookie made from corn. How much of it is made from corn?  I have no friggin clue. Regardless, it tastes yummy to the tummy so that's what counts!  They also have a decent selection of signature cocktails and beer. Gotta say this place stands out the most when I visited Arizona.",

The burger and the Del Real sandwich tied for tops on our list, followed closely by the open-faced peanut butter sandwich and the salmon with black beans.  To top it off, they have several pastry items and signature drinks to help wash it all down.  The combination of the bar, patio, bakery, dining area and farmers market will keep Phoenix Public Market Cafe busy for a very long time.  Aaron Chamberlin and company hit a home run with St. Francis, but they knocked it out of the stadium with Phoenix Public Market Cafe!!!

    "text": "The Phoenix Public Market Cafe is a definite \"must visit\" for lunch if you find yourself in the Downtown Phoenix area. I've already visited 3 times within the past month and each time I was not disappointed. The Market Cafe is located off of Central on Pierce in a recently renovated space that once housed the Phoenix Public Market grocery store. But instead of talking about the history, let's talk about my experience at the Market Cafe.   During my first visit, I did a quick overview of their menu and ordered the AZ Burger just to play it safe. The AZ Burger came with green chile, lettuce, cheddar, and their house dressing. The burger was cooked well and the bread that holds all the goodness together is great. I was not disappointed with the burger or the service during my first visit.   For my second visit, I decided to try something else and ordered the grilled cheese which is served on toasted multi-grain bread with sharp cheddar cheese. You're probably reading this and thinking that I could have made the same thing at home. You're right! However, what makes this grilled cheese awesome is the bread. Even though the bread is toasted, it remained a little soft and warm in the middle while the crust had a nice toast to it. In addition to the sandwich, I ordered a side of fries that also didn't disappoint. They were lightly salted and still a tad soft when they were plated and served. My second visit was a success.   Can the Phoenix Public Market Cafe go three for three? You bet they can! I went back for a third visit and ordered the fries again but this time I ordered the chicken salad sandwich which is served with basil, pine nuts, arugula, and tomatoes all found between two slices of 9-grain bread. This sandwich packs some amazing flavor and some texture thanks to the bread they used. Whomever the Market Cafe is using as their baker, they should do everything in their power not to lose him/her.   To date, my experiences at the Market Cafe have been positive thanks to the great food and service. Aaron Chamberlin has done an amazing job with the space and also brought a wonderful yet simple menu to the Downtown Phoenix area. By the way, If you have specific dietary needs (i.e. vegetarian, vegan, gluten free, dairy free), then this is a place you can visit and find something that suits your needs as well.   If you are a supporter of local and enjoy good food, be sure to visit the Market Cafe at the Phoenix Public Market.",

While boasting lots of alternative diet options on the menu, I found it surprising that they didn't have that. So while I wanted to order a sandwich, I ended up having breakfast food instead. Eggs were cooked nicely, but I was hoping for more of sweet potato fries vs a whole sweet potato that had been cut into 1\" slices.",

The first time I ordered an iced americano at the coffee bar. Their large drinks come with two shots, so I asked for an extra shot, it came out to four dollars. When I got it it was still extremely watered down, so I went back up to the counter and explained to the guy and just asked him if I could pay for another shot. I had 2 bucks in my hand and he grabbed the money and stuffed it in the tip jar! After I got my americano it was still gross and watery.   The second time I came here for breakfast and only got a glass of water and bagel with the herb cream cheese. The bagel was as hard as a rock and the cream cheese tasted (and looked) more like herb mayo. Gross.   I've heard they have a good happy hour for cocktails, so maybe next time they'll redeem themselves.",

It's a rustic space that still retains much of the market grocery charm but with phenomenal touches from Aaron, Lee, and team.  The patio is not too crowded and seated nicely, perfect for dinner or drinks with friends.  The flow is also fantastic as you can either head directly to the bar or browse the market on your way to the counter to order.    We had a limited menu tonight for opening night.  That being said, we both enjoyed our meals thoroughly.  The AZ burger (& fries) was delicious and the chino salad was good and refreshing (though I'm not a noodles in my salad person, but I wanted a salad).  Both with a farmer's cup in hand (pimms drink - yum!) and I was giddy as a schoolchild over the self serve water station with sparkling and still options.  I want to go back right now for the sparkling water on tap alone!  We each also had a smores cookie for dessert.  It captures the graham crackeriness of a smores and chocolate chunks and chewy texture without marshmallows.  It was an interesting (and delicious) interpretation.  I was also eyeing the snickerdoodles.  I'll be back for those.  We were sent away with a couple corn cookies to try (at Aaron's insistence).  THe husband is currently a fan (description: sugar cookie, but like cornbread, but not; it's really good), I'm skeptical of most things with corn.  We'll certainly be back and are excited to see the rest of the menu and make this our local hangout. :)",

They do their own rotisserie chicken and always have a succulent special on the go. They have awesome salads and cater to the Rabbit-food crowd with ease. They make their own desserts, and have a little grocery isle offering interesting food items as well as other nicknacks and fun stuff. I have never been disappointed in anything I have ever had there, most recently the kale salad with chicken added.  If you go there for lunch during the week or for brunch on the weekends it will be BUSY! If they only have one cash open the line forms very quickly and longly, so if you are in a rush, I would go elsewhere, as once you order you wait at your table and they bring the food out to you. One cool feature is that you can get a self-serve glass of regular or sparkling water free of charge on tap including citrus slices. They have a full bar that can be sat at inside and out. This is one of our go-to places when wanting some decent nosh when downtown. Be aware that the prices are somewhat pricey for those who buy their lunch daily. My salad was $9.00 plus $4.00 to add chicken. So if you usually like to keep linch under $10, I would go elsewhere, but definitely splash out once in awhile for some delectable and mostly locally sourced delights here!",

This is a \"walk up and order\" joint which usually gives me anxiety as I feel rushed into a decision. There was a \"calm\" about the room that made me feel at ease. The kids got pastries which were heavenly!!! I wish I would have gotten one. The egg dish I hair (frittata) was ok but nothing special.   The service here is AMAZING. We were checked in on several times and in a very genuine and non-obstructive way.   Would definitely recommend.",

We normally go for lunch pretty frequently and I have had nothing but awesome food. i am obssessed with the chicken salad sandwhich and then the Chino salad in that order. I haven't had a bad dessert and I have yet to drink there but that's to come for sure.   We go in and oorder and it's packed for lunch. My colleauge and I sit outside, which wasn't too bad for the first 20 minutes and I notice that my food hadn't arrived yet. Just as I was thinking about it , Cory the manager comes out to tell me that they are comping my food. He said that the wait was completely unacceptable and basically that's not how they roll. The truth of the matter is, I would have waited another 20 minutes for that sandwhich. It really made my day to have that happen. It feels like such a rare occassion that people go out of their way and it's nice when to see.",

Every single thing we ordered was so good. I opted for a grilled cheese w/FF and a chocolate chip cookie as well as a macaroon (I have a sweet tooth and their sweets rock!) We also ordered their pork pot pie, so different, so filling, so yummy! There are several things I was trying to decide on so I guess this means I'll be coming back soon and trying the other items. Loved the vibe of this place, great for people watching, to hang with friends, to enjoy a casual brunch with friends or family. Very kid friendly too, loved the outside seating area with fans and water misting to keep you cool through these Arizona hot summers. I'd also like to note that even though I ordered at the counter then sat down and they bring the food to us, the servers seemed very friendly and helpful as well if we needed anything else. Make sure you leave them a nice tip, they were working so hard and with a smile.",

Simply put: if you enjoy delicious food, don't wait for Wednesday/Saturday to roll around.  Celebrate your taste buds!  Go forth, and fill . your . face!  I popped over for Saturday morning breakfast.  I opted for the full service bar, though you may order at the counter and seat yourself (later in the day they have patio seating near a woodstove!).  At 7am it was easy to get a seat, but I had been warned that Saturday is their busiest day - so be wary of late brunch rush.  Each of their breakfast offerings were tempting, but I was captivated by the Evans-Churchill.  Two poached eggs over market-fresh veg sauteed in agave + pesto, dressing up a foundation of quinoa.  Vegan/gluten-friendly and all for $10.25.  A cup of Cartel coffee (so delicious it needs not cream nor sugar!), and my Evans-Churchill + a side of potatoes ($4 for 4 baby-fist sized potats!) - I was in heaven.  Sunshine, excellent indie-rock buzzing through the room, a video loop of reaching and growing radishes over the course of 42 days, and did I mention the flavor explosion in my mouth?  AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!  While I was absolutely busting at the seems, my eyes were still hungry for more more MORE of the menu!  Freshly squeezed juices offer the perfect compliment to the full bar offerings.  So SOOOO many plates: Eat the Rainbow (steamed and raw veg with a variety of sauces), Chicpea Pancakes (with banana and almond), House Pretzels (with jalapeno cheese sauce) - the list goes on, and is ever-evolving, revolving with the seasons.  And for checking in on Yelp, I got to take a cookie (a scrumptious pecan sandie) for the road!  The PPMC is one of those places that when you leave, you look longingly over your shoulder and whisper like Harry Potter, \"I'm not going home, not really.\"  The tip top crown of my brief Western adventure, and so much to warm a polar vortex heart.  I will return to AZ, if only for another breakfast in the sunlit table tops of the PPMC.",

It's one of the only red wines in AZ that I don't have to sneak an ice cube into; it's already chilled!   I've eaten here plenty of times and would give a 5/5 time and time again. From their glittery macarons (literally glittery - gold and silver speckled!) to their kale salad, it is fantastic. Their mimosas, cocktails, coffee, and bottled beverage options could please any crowd. It's a great place for a date, homework, business meeting, or grabbing a quick bite on the go.   One of my favorite aspects of the market is the farmers market and food truck Fridays that they host. It promotes an eat local atmosphere.",

I had a giant salad, and my kids had sandwiches. The food was excellent, but what I really liked was the atmosphere.

The fries are great but a little more generous helping... come on it is a potato. The chicken was finger licking sticky good. I could have devoured a whole bird easily... darn organic birds are soo petite. Bring on the GMO chicken the size of Godzilla with breasts as big as Texas. I would definitely come back for the chicken. We didn't try any of the baked goods but the cinnamon roll had a fedora of sweet tooth glazing that was begging to be eaten.",

We enjoy the wine and the music for a while and then headed inside for dinner. The restaurant was crowded, loud and had a great vibe and we seated ourselves very quickly. I ordered the chili verde pot pie which was amazing, it sounds strange but its a must try !! everyone else ordered the AZ burger which was also delicious. Our friends order the kid's grilled cheese and it looked like a grilled cheese that I would want to eat! Their kid's meals are $3--- you can't be that! It was a great experience and we will go back. And seriously---get the chili verde pot pie!",

The Salmon has a light glaze crust that trapped the heat so well I was able to concentrate on the Veggies and the Tatters first without having Ymir worry about my fish getting cold.  The Mixed Vegetables mostly consisted of Broccoli and Brussel Sprouts. They were ok as for a Brussel Sprouts good (not my favorite veggie, just sayin). Now the Garlic Mashed Potatoes were on Point. I can see myself going in and just order a side of them. The Salmon was hot and MOIST but a bit on the small size (that's what she said). The taste made up for the portion size (that's what he said). I would definitely order again. Well done.",

Since I saw the pictures of the Devil Fries, I knew I had to get it so there was no question there, but what else to eat? I ended up choosing the chorizo biscuits and gravy and a side of carrot cake to top it off and I think I did good.   Devil fries - yummy! Love the sauces it comes with. Even though its 10 dollars, I totally recommend getting it, worth the monies.  Chorizo biscuits and gravy with over easy eggs - Love the twist on this, like how theres a spice to it, but with any biscuits and gravy, I can never finish the whole thing because I get bored after a while, so make sure you have someone to share it with because the portion is pretty generous.   Carrot cake - Hm the flavor of this is very good BUT it was a little on the dry side. I can see potential if it was a little less dry.   Definitely coming back here to try their coffees and other goodies they have to offer. Cant wait!",

My wife didn't like the Chino salad and only had a couple of bites.  I went to the front and talked to a staff member to see if we could exchange it for something else on the menu.  He spoke to Adrian the manager who told him he'd talk to me about it.  All the while Adrian's back was towards me.  Five minutes went by and Adrian never turned around to address me.  I got tired of standing there and went back to my table.  I continued to watch Adrian and 10 more minutes went by and he still never turned around.  It was one of the most blatant disregards of customer attentiveness or service that I've seen in a long time.  I would imagine that Cliff the owner would like to know that one of his managers isn't quite as dedicated to his cause as he would hope.  It's a shame that this one employee caused a bad experience at what probably is a pretty good place.  My family won't be going back.",

The kids options were really good and well priced for only $3. Parking was completely full but street parking was available.

I came at brunch time and was all by myself. I don't even remember the name of what I ordered but I would order it again in a heartbeat and I can't wait to take hubby so he can taste it as well! It was a slice of toast (of course on their really yummy bread) smeared with fresh avocado and covered with Nova Lox and then topped with two perfectly poached eggs. The ratio of salmon to avocado to capers was spot on. When I checked in on Yelp I received a free cookie so I made my way up after my meal to pick one out. There were so many different kinds that I couldn't decide on just one and ended up buying another one! Both were delicious and I could see me getting addicted to them! Will definitely make my way here in the near future to try lunch!",

I've had the Del Real sandwich a couple times, and it ranks high on my list of veggie sandwiches!

Decor was simple and casual - exactly what you'd imagine from a farmers' market. Not sure why this excited me so, but they have carafes and glasses for all your still/sparkling water needs. For a thirsty thirsty person, I guess that'd save you a trip or so.  I was undecided between the Flanched Flarney Garney (scrambled egg sandwich w/ chunky avocado, mayo, bacon, and cheddar cheese) and Tito's Cubano. I ended up going with the Flarney Garney per the cashier's recommendation (and who wouldn't with such a fun name!?). It was pretty good! I wouldn't say it was the best breakfast sandwich I've ever had, but it was definitely tasty and very filling!  The grapes/oranges that came on the side were SO fresh and delicious - the perfect touch after a fairly heavy sandwich. I also tried some of my friend's fries, but these were a tad lackluster for me.  Oh, and with your free Yelp check-in, you get a cookie! I got the ballerina cookie and really enjoyed it. I'd recommend it if you like a nutty cookie that's not overbearingly sweet.  Overall, I like that this is right by the public market. It really reminds you just how fresh your food is, and that it's locally sourced! It's great if you're looking for some fresh, simple, and reliable sandwiches in a cute casual environment!",

There is indoor seating and patio seating. You review the menu prior to placing your order at the counter. You are then given a number and you select your own seats. I opted to order the rotisserie chicken and fries. They have can and bottle drinks in the small fridge and if you check in you get a free cookie.  Pay attention to the cookies though. I noticed some flies swarming around and landing on the cookies. Luckily my cookie came from the bottom. I ordered the chocolate chip cookie and yum LOTS of chocolate chips like I like them. Also definitely warm it up!  My entree was super salty. The chicken had a strange taste like it was covered in bacon, but no bacon in sight. The fries were salty too. The first couple bites were OK but after a while, I had to give my meal to my friend.  What I thought was cool was that they offered sparkling and regular water (serve your own). Silverware is located on the table, but if you sit outside, you deal with the flies. It was warm out also, so if you're not used to the heat, you better make your way inside!  Service was friendly and dining here was an OK experience for our first meal in Phoenix.",

    "text": "After the great reviews about the fried chicken on a local Phoenix TV Show, our experience this afternoon was truly a disappointment. We ordered the Community Special. You pay up front when you order and I included the tip when I paid. We chose to sit outside because the music was rather loud inside.  The small salads were fresh and tasty, but when the Server brought the main entrees we were told to come back into the restaurant when we were through to let her know we were ready for desert. As for the entrees, my pasta was just okay and my wife's fried chicken was over cooked, over breaded, and turned out to be 2 very small chicken legs. Because I let the server know our opinion about the condition of the fried chicken, the manager came out and stated \"I know you weren't happy about having paid for parking to start with and now I hear you have you have a problem with our chicken, so here's a 15 Dollar Gift Card.\" As far as the Manager's Parking comment is concerned, the restaurant faces Pierce St  and a slew of parking meters and a paid parking lot across the street in front. You have to drive pass their building to see their free lot. I did not, so that one is on me. But being asked by your Server to leave your table and track them down to be served the final course is just plain rude and I should of asked for the tip back if I'm expected to do part our their job for them.  And as for the Manager's comment about my problem with their fried chicken, please see the attached photo, it speaks for itself. Atmosphere: Young and Loud Food: Average at Best Service: Minimal and expect to participate.  Recommendation: Maybe we went on a bad day, but it's a No",

I said it is like a 1/4 chicken and my friends said no, it's less than that.   I do have to say that the veggie rice bowl one of my friends ordered was really good. The ginger sauce was amazing.  Everyone complained that they weren't given enough food, especially for the cost.",

We had a great time!  Tried some macarons and enjoyed a latte and cold brew.  Even got a free cookie for checking in on yelp.  Gorgeous decor and excellent staff!  Everyone was super friendly and the environment was comfortable and fun.  Enjoyable end to our mother & daughter birthday day out.",

Today I got the Quinoa bowl and besides the eggs, everything was completely cold. I'm not sure why it's busy, it's sad,  people have just accepted poor service and mediocre food these days.

I was staying in downtown and needed to find a place to grab food and to get some work done - this was the perfect place. They have an indoor area and small patio area outside.   I got a hot tea and a devil's mess! It was delicious and very filling! I loved how the dish was served with a side of tortilla so I basically made my own breakfast taco! Yum!   I ended up staying there for 2 hours to do work and ended up ordering a chicken quesadilla and fries to go. The quesadilla was flavored well but the draw back was the ratio of chicken to cheese was 3:1. Would have liked more chicken!   PS. Checkin and get that gooey delicious cookie! :) And they have sparkling water on tap!",

It was a Monday night near closing time, & they have the 3-course dinner special for $12.99 (Sun & Mon nights from 5pm-close). There are three options, but I got the fried chicken with mashed potatoes with a salad and red pudding dessert. The fried chicken had a REALLY thick layer of breading, but overall was pretty good. The salad was standard and the red pudding was sweet and yummy! I also had french macarons from their in-house bakery to-go. They make it from scratch and as a macaron connoisseur, I thought they were pretty good! I'd come back again and try a different dish and their other pastries.  The aesthetics in here are so cute, and when I went, seemed pretty casual. I can see it as being good for both dressy & casual though! There's parking right outside of it and a farmers market every Saturday.",

The burrito is too soggy and the ingredients lose their pan-kissed goodness being wrapped in the tortilla. The chorizo's crispiness and the pepper's heat get obscured by liquid from the spinach and the steamy, buttery goodness of the fresh tortilla gets lost when they toast the rolled burrito and seal the juices in.

We were looking for a healthy restaurant that wasn't too far from the airport, and this was perfect.  We stopped in, ate some quinoa and were on our way to the airport.    I had the quinoa bowl, which I first thought might be too boring, but it was very well-flavored.  It came with poached eggs, market veggies and pesto.  This bowl made me wish I knew how to cook and flavor quinoa!  I want their recipe because I normally get bored with quinoa bowls.  My mom had the rice bowl and it was lackluster.  She was jealous of my yummy quinoa bowl because hers wasn't as flavored.  It came with brown rice, market veggies, avocado, mushrooms, sesame seeds, mayo, vinaigrette, cilantro and mint.  Caution, it's serviced chilled.  I normally enjoy my rice hot, so it was a little weird to me.  Cookies: Tip: Check in with Yelp and get a free cookie!  SO yummy!  They had lots of options.  I had the white chocolate chip one with cranberries and it was super yummy!   Pats for the clever cookie names like the Ballerina, etc.  Drinks: They serve wine, beer and cocktails!  Seating and ambiance: It's an open seating area and you order at the counter, and then find your table.  There's lots of light and it's has a nice warm feel.    Parking: free parking lot with lots of covered parking spots.  Service: Friendly and helpful service.  They answered all our questions, and didn't mind giving me my free cookie even when I forgot to show them my Yelp checkin until after we paid.  Final verdict: Great healthy option with quick service and close to the airport.",

I came here during Happy Hour (which I didn't even realize this place has), and I liked what they had to offer. My mom & I split a quesadilla and nachos. She had a glass of white wine & I had a mini pitcher of beer (off the top of my head I can't remember what, but it was an IPA brewed locally in Scottsdale that was pretty tasty). During HH each of these items were $5 (and like I said, the beer was a mini pitcher so it was more than a pint) so we had a pretty solid meal for $20. Both the quesadilla & nachos tasted yummy & the portions were generous.   We were able to order everything from the bar & our food was ready pretty quickly. I should also mention that I realized I had a coupon in my wallet for a free cookie (from the Elite event mentioned earlier that was a LONG time ago), and when I sheepishly asked if I could use it I was told of course. The chocolate chip cookie I had was quite good.   I wish I lived closer to this place so I could stop by more often, but I'll definitely remember it when I'm in the area.",

    "text": "I'll admit, I was not in a great mood when I was dining here.  I was traveling with my mom and she could not make a decision on where to eat so we ended up walking for an hour and stopping by like 2-3 other restaurants (love her but not her best moment).  So I found this spot and we walked the additional quarter mile here.  The staff and service were fantastic- super friendly and helpful.   The menu looked great- mostly healthy and fresh options, which is sometimes a challenge to find when traveling a lot (NOLA- I'm looking at you with 1-2 salads on the menu, and buttery, delicious, sauteed veggies).  Anyway- I make some pretty bomb salads at home (for an eighth of the price), so it's not typically on my list of things to order when I'm out, but they sounded great.  I saw some yelpers mention the pulled pork, so I tried that and my mom got the Cubano.  The sandwich was huge and the bun was little too much, so I ended up just eating the pork, which was good, but definitely not the best pulled pork I've had.  The sauce was a little too sweet for my taste and pork seemed like it was not homemade/ in house... It didn't have that fresh, smoky, taste/smell to it, almost like it was a crockpot pulled pork recipe, and it was really pretty average to me.  The Cubano on the other hand was really good.  I loved the free cookie for checking in (a sugar cookie with corn- unexpected, but nice texture surprise).  Again, the staff and service was fantastic, but the food just missed the mark for me.",

They have a \"farm to table\" and \"local\" vibe but the menu never changes so not sure how that works.  Come here a few times a year because my wife likes it and it's only fair since I drag her places she'd rather not go.   When I cook I never add salt to my food, but I find the food here to be under-seasoned and bland. My wife agrees on this point. The Cuban sandwich is a let down, but I've lived in Florida so maybe I'm spoiled.   The quesadilla I had last night had two of four pieces with more than 50% emptiness (just tortilla in each bite I didn't eat). One of the two remaining pieces had about 10 of the 15 slices of jalapeno in the entire quesadilla.  All in one bite. Very lazy prep work. The cheese is good but not good for a quesadilla. Cheese oil was dripping all over me and making the tortilla soggy. Chicken was dry and void of flavor.   The nachos were super dried out the one time I had them. Never again.   The pot pie is the only menu item I'd ever order again. It's quite good. It's just very heavy and it wasn't an option this time since I had no place to store leftovers.",

However, the service set aside, the food itself is kind of a joke such as the rotisserie chicken for which you are supposedly getting a half chicken with two sides. I got the order to go and once I got home and opened the container, there was no chicken breast, only two pieces of chicken that did not represent a \"half chicken.\" for which I paid 14 dollars. The sides were quite delicious especially the steamed broccoli. I can't say that the mashed potatoes were the best I've ever had but they were passable and my dog seemed to have enjoyed them.   Food and service aside, it was a piece of cake to park. The interior of the cafe is nice and airy and quite welcoming. For a beverage note, all I had was a latte from their Cartel coffee beans and I thought it was below average considering I had just paid a visit to Lux Central up the street.  All in all, a very nice space but in order to wow me back, the food and beverage truly need improvement. I would love to visit their Saturday morning open air market at the next opportunity.",

I had two sides that come in the price.  I got home with the vittles and when I opened the bag and pulled out the containers, everything was really nice and colorful.  I had sides of broccoli and sweet potato.  I started with the chicken.  It was a whole thigh (with leg) and a breast.  I searched around the container for the wing, and well, no dice.  I bit into my least favorite part, which was the thigh and all types of flavor came bursting from that juicy bite!  Nice hickory  / woody flavor and smoothly detached from the bone as needed.  Very tasty!  The breast was boneless and delicious as well.  Juicy and flavorful but small.  But honestly, I thought I was going to get an entire half chicken with bones, etc.    Quality over quantity?  Yes, but I was hungry and would have appreciated all the chicken quantity and flavor still versus the little I got especially for the price.    The side of broccoli was steamed nicely and the side of sweet potato perfectly baked.    No True complaints here except the cafe markets the rotisserie as a half chicken and they should change that to just a boneless breast and thigh.  Overall, service was quick, professional and nice.  I'd order again, but maybe not when I am so hungry perhaps.  Would love to give a 5-star but I felt a little robbed because I don't like dark meat chicken as much as the white meat and with the missing wing, it was a bit deflating.  So 4-stars it goes for now.",

I had the Devils Mess which is billed as eggs, farm veggies, schreiners chorizo and chiles. What I received was a couple of scrambled eggs a piece of spinach and a couple strips of chile with a slice of cold half buttered stale bread. No fruit, potatoes or sides came with it. I brought four college kids and all ended up going back for pastries to fill up.",

    "text": "Really debated giving this four stars, but I'll stick with three. Had lunch here with my parents before they headed off to Oregon, and I suggested this place because I had always wanted to try it and it is close to my office. Got the Rachel sandwich which was very good. I got a side of broccoli as well. This is going to sound super weird, but the broccoli was reallyyyy good! No idea what they put on it, but it tasted like lemon and butter with a tad bit of salt maybe. It was perfectly cooked too. My parents seemed like they enjoyed their food. Everything was very healthy but still tasty. This is one of those places that seems consistently good, and an all around go-to lunch spot if you're in the area. Would I go out of my way to go here (I live in Tempe)? No necessarily. Though I do want to try their breakfast one weekend morning!  My main complaint and reason for three stars was their espresso. I ordered a shot, and it had to be the worst shot of espresso I have ever had. Very Very bitter (and not in the good way that espresso is supposed to be). Though I did just return from Europe several months ago, so many my standards are still too high? Anyway, I'd steer clear of their coffee. Normally I don't think something like this would be a big deal, but I love coffee with every ounce in me. And a bad espresso is no bueno in my book.",

    "text": "I'll keep this brief. The ambience is great, especially in the early winter in Phoenix. You can sit outside and enjoy a nice breeze. The tap is great, coffee solid. The food is plenty good. I got the Cubano which, despite being a bit cheesy/greasy, was good. It came with a pickle on the side (as it should) and three red grapes. The food didn't fill the large plate so it looked sparse and haphazard. The pickle I get, but three red grapes? Did they run out of something? The fries that I got on the side were good but they didn't give enough ketchup to last the whole bowl.  My main point of contention on the Public Market is the price, espcially relative to the quality and portions of the food. I recently moved from San Francisco, so I am very used to this style of food and the price you'd normally pay. But this is not San Francisco. This is Phoenix. And the main selling point of Phoenix is the cost effectiveness of it. For a Cubano sandwich and side of fries (no drink), I paid more than $16. For $16 in Phoenix, I expect much much more than a solid if unspectacular Cubano, a pickle spear, three red grapes, good french fries and not enough ketchup. Had this meal cost me $10-$12, it would be solid but not a value. There are plenty of other options downtown that provide superior food and a better value.",

    "text": "We came downtown for Food Truck Friday today to try and grab some lunch. Unfortunately, when we got there, a lack of cash (poor planning), indecision, long lines and extreme hunger lead us to head to PPM where we could pay with a card and get served more quickly. Now I wish I wouldn't have been so hangry (hungry +angry) and had waited for a Short Leash hotdog.   We walked a few yards to PPM and I stepped up and asked for a chino salad. The dude taking our order said they were in the case behind me. I thought it was weird that they would sell you already made salads when there were fresh sandwiches coming from the kitchen but I had never been so I assumed this was just the way they operated.   We sat out on the patio which I'll admit was nice and shaded. Phoenix is amazing in March and the weather was perfect. I opened up the salad and notice there is a huge pile of red bell pepper in the middle which wasn't listed as an ingredient on the menu. Not a big deal, really, but I happen to dislike bell pepper quite a bit. I just pulled them out and that was that. Again, not a deal breaker, but a little annoying. On the other hand, cashews (which WERE listed on the menu) were practically nonexistent. I think I found 3 pieces? Cashew are likely the most expensive item to purchase in the salad and thus, drive up the price of the salad overall. Very annoying. On the whole, this salad was plain, boring and could be made a thousand times better at home.   To add insult to injury, TWO people eating next to us order the same salad, but it was brought to them fresh, in a bowl, and one woman even had spinach added to her salad, which I didn't even know was an option. I can't speak to the number of ingredients in their food or the taste, but it was definitely fresh made and from the kitchen, not kept in a fridge and made ahead of time.   Now, I realized that part of the issue was my ignorance to the way this place works so I didn't complain to anyone. I don't think I was treated poorly intentionally, but even if my salad HAD been given to me from the kitchen, I would have remained disappointed with the quality being what is was. I feel doubtful about going back which sucks because I really wanted to like this place and my food :(",

    "text": "I remember the old public market grocery and cafe, St. Francis' restauranteurs have truly revitalized it and created a cool and ultra hip space for sipping and dining.   First of all, killer happy hour from 3pm - close which allows you to imbibe some of the smartest crafted cocktails - Lee Trevino is my personal fave and most of the bartenders and gives nice kick of spice that I miss from often overly sweet one note cocktails. The local beers on tap change every so often. along with the awesome happy hour, it offers a great indoor/ outdoor bar which allows you to take advantage of the solid 7 hour happy hour no matter the weather.  Also, breakfast served until 3pm. Hallelujah! This place became clutch after one of those mornings where we didn't wake up for a proper brunch time but still wanted some perfectly cooked eggs and home fries. The Flanched Flarney Garney spectacularly pairs eggs, bacon, avocado, and all the other fixings into a huge, delectable, and deviously delicious breakfast sandwich. The regular menu is pretty varied and can please vegetarians and vegans alike and I have only had the sandwiches which seem to satisfy and are served with a kosher pickle and a summer slice of watermelon which means if you want side you have to add them on for an extra cost.  One thing that St. Francis' folk have done excellently in executing this revamp is creating a perfectly hip industrial yet warm and inviting space. The different levels of seating options,create an urban rustic feel make for a great place to catch up with friends, take a date, lunch with parents, or just hang solo at the bar. The outdoor with the fireplace will definitely become a highly desired spot for wine sipping during the colder months.   One thing is the whole organization of ordering food/ beverages. The place makes it slightly confusing in how to get your full service of food and drink. If you seat at the bar you can get both but if you plan to seat yourself somewhere else you must order separately and deal with paying on separate checks. If there were some way to iron out that process this place would be almost perfect.",

Unlike St. Francis, you ordered at the counter and the food is brought out to you. The menu is interesting, but not overwhelming big. We opted for the Del Real Sandwich and the Roosevelt Row Bagel. Both were brought out promptly and done very well. The Del Real had a subtle sweetness to it. The bagel was a two different tastes. Guacamole on one side and hummus on the other.   The decor resembles that of St. Francis. A bit utilitarian and semi-industrial. That said, the place was comfortable. We did not check it out, but there is a bar you can sit at as well.",

It was topped with sunflower seeds and toasted bread. I also ordered their house pretzels with jalapeno white cheddar cheese, and the pretzels were delicious. Didn't care for the cheese, though. I got a free cookie for checking in with Yelp, which is always a nice perk. Great staff, and lots of other menu items to choose from. I probably will be back.",

    "text": "After hearing about the restaurateur behind the Cafe I was anxious to put a fork and knife in my hand to decide for myself, what this place was about... To give some insight I wasn't green to this place I had heard about the \"farm fresh\" ingredients and truly believed this could be the spot but my excitement turned once I found the truth behind what was on my plate. I went in two occasions recently once for brunch and the second for dinner service, at brunch I was met with a breakfast burrito that was 90% egg the other 10% was split between cheese and bacon (not locally sourced pork come to find out) I was disappointed to say the least that I was given when added up a fingers length of bacon. I had specifically asked for my eggs to be scrambled soft but as the eggs were being slung at 12:30 I should've known better than to expect perfection but I would've never thought they would come out how my grandmother used to make them (cooked till as dry as her aging skin) back to the bacon, it had a weird discoloration as if it had been dehydrated or deep fat fried neither of which are my optimal choices for cooking bacon (even on large scale) after a displeasing brunch I left wondering if that was what really had everyone filling this place up on the daily. I headed back later in the week for an early dinner met by the not so hospitable day manager I say so due to his attitude towards people around me (never once approached me). I went through the same routine ordering my food exactly as I like my burger cooked medium rare with the large portion of the \"downtown devil fries\"; The fries... the dressings were good although simple, the fries were soggy and bland on there own and with the dusting of herbs to much for me to handle. Now to my burger, once again I'll mention I had asked medium rare. I was given a well burger....now to the toppings fitted to my burger the green Chile's dressed on it could be done at home and way better with some love as well as saving you a few bucks, any backyard wannabe grill master even knows not to put cheddar cheese on a burger. It's a dry cheese... once again the thousand island dressing was substantial. In closing I was saddened to see that it was not truly \"farm fresh\" or \"farm to table\" and the prices matched those of places really bringing in product from local farms. The farmers product stops at the parking lot on Saturdays for the market but doesn't make it in the door and on to your plate. I was disappointed to say the least.",

The staff here are always super friendly and the atmosphere here is cool and fun. It's definitely a place to take a group of friends for a hang out.  I've tried their Pop Tarts, macaroons (Coconut Curry, Strawberry, Chocolate Espresso), BBQ Pulled Pork sandwich, Cinnamon Roll, freshly made Cafe Juice, Chicken Quesadilla and Ballerina cookie. All of which were very delicious except for the cinnamon roll. I ordered one to go and when I got home I was very disappointed. The texture of the roll was dense and dry. Although I can say the giant glob of buttercream frosting and caramel sauce on top was amazingly done. My most favorites are the coconut curry macaroons and the magnificent ballerina cookies! All of their macaroons are fabulously done and I love how they rotate the flavors. The coconut curry one was an interesting yet surprisingly yummy treat. The ballerina cookie is equally tasty as well, I just love the salt sprinkled on top. Get there early though because their ballerina cookies sell out fast!  All in all, a great place to chill and support local farmers!",

    "text": "4.5 stars! The Phoenix Public Market Cafe is a really cute place - love the look of the interior, brick walls and lots of wooden tables. They've got a big menu with lots of vegetarian and vegan options, as well as some gluten free and fairy free options too. I came here to eat twice on my visit to Phoenix. The first time I came, I had breakfast and ordered the Devil's Mess, scrambled eggs with spinach, chorizo, chiles, and onions. I also ordered a latte (with almond milk instead of regular), a strawberry poptart, and for checking in on the yelp app, I got a free cookie! For the cookie, I got to choose from what they had in the display case, and I picked the corn cookie.   I don't normally eat poptarts, but there were so many yelp photos of it, so I decided to try it. And it was delicious! Definitely not like the store-bought packaged poptarts. The outside pastry part was soft and flaky and the filling was really yummy. The corn cookie was really good and you could see actual corn kernals in it. This may actually rival Momofuku's corn cookie! The Devil's Mess came and this was also really delicious - the eggs were cooked perfectly and the chorizo and the chiles tasted great. The dish came with a tortilla - I wasn't entirely sure if I was supposed to build myself my own breakfast burrito with it. The really nice server came by to ask how my food was and he told me that next time, I could order the Devil's Mess as a breakfast burrito, which is really good to know. I just ripped the tortilla into pieces and ate it with my eggs. The latte was really good - I had originally asked to get it with soy milk instead, but the cashier recommended that I get it with almond milk. I really enjoyed my dining experience!   I came back a few days later to eat lunch here with a couple of people. I was still craving something breakfast-y and couldn't decide between the Evans-Churchill and the Chick Pea pancake, so I asked the cashier. She immediately recommended the chick pea pancake, which is vegan and comes with sliced banana and agave syrup. We sat in their outdoor seating area, which is shaded. Just a warning, there may be some pesky flies if you sit outside. I thought the chick pea pancake was just okay. I didn't really like the flavor. I wouldn't order it again. I did also get to try the house pretzels with the white cheddar sauce and this was really good.   You order first at the cashier and pay, you get a number and they bring you your food to your table. Water is self-service and you can get it at the water table, just next to the entrance to the outdoor seating area. The service is excellent, most of the food is amazing, the space is really cute. They use as much local and organic ingredients to cook their food, which is great. Definitely a great place to eat in Phoenix!",

I ordered the roasted pork sandwich that's only served on Fridays and Saturdays.  My significant other ordered a scrambled egg dish.  Both were delish, but we liked my sandwich a little more.  Next time I'll be sure to tell the guy behind the counter to go a little lighter on the lemon aioli.    The lemon aioli is a hit - BUT a little too much can take away from the flavors in the pork.  The cashier let us taste a piece of the pork before we ordered.  We loved it!  Once I got the sandwich, the pork flavor wasn't as potent because of the lemon aioli.  Overall, we totally enjoyed the experience and food and will definitely return!  oh .. grab a iced latte with a shot of vanilla... heaven seeping through a straw I tell ya :)",

We happened upon this place and were completely blown away.  Entering I was delighted to see a high level of craftsmanship in their dining area. While it is not the rustic, hipster, foodie place it could come off as being, it delivered an excellent meal by a very well informed waitress, Victoria- ask for her, you'll like her.  I had a chicken caesar salad and was shocked to find they actually use chunks of chicken off of a rotisserrie chicken in the back- not a diced up breast from the grill. My son ate an Arizona burger and loved it. We shared a piece of their chocolate cake and it was a perfect end to a great meal. We have three more days here in the area and I will be going back!",

But I always have to wait WAY too long, and often don't get what I happened to order (this happened today, when I ordered a large latte, got a regular, which is tiny BTW, and when I asked about it I was made to feel like I had made the mistake, instead of someone just offering to fix it). During the evening, you are waited on, but both times I've been here for dinner, it has been nearly impossible to get food, drink, and bill in a timely manner.   My other gripe is that the food is overpriced. I like some of the food (the pretzel appetizer is awesome), but most of it is smaller than you'd expect (e.g., the asian chicken salad) and definitely more than you'd like to pay for it.   It's too bad, because it's near my house and I love the concept and decor. Alas, for coffee I love Lola and Giant about 1,000 times more, and there is obviously better food nearby.",

    "text": "Super chill with warm, friendly staff.  I had a great discussion about the difference between a macaron and macaroon with the bartendress, who apparently had just competed in a local bartending competition.  Great aesthetic with an indoor and outdoor seating area.  You can sidle up to the bar from outside as well.  A nice selection of beers and wines with a full bar, plus espresso.  I had a sandwich that was quite good.  It was a Rachel (Reuben with turkey instead of pastrami or corned beef).  The bread was super thick, so it was a mouthful and a half.  I was more than satisfied with the portion.  I also had a cookie because you got a free one with a Yelp checkin, not the macaron.  It was delicious.  I would go back here on a nice day fo'sho.",

    "text": "Love the atmosphere. What a cool find. Too bad about the loooong wait for food.  We heard they were dog friendly so we had lunch here on New Years Day after going to the dog park downtown.   We placed a food order and we were warned that the wait for food was around 30 minutes. Which was fine by us. We picked up a pastry to hold us over and I ordered a bloody mary. Ordering a cocktail can be kind of confusing. You can either go to the bar separately to order one, or order one at the food counter like I did. But then I had to go to the bar and tell the bartender that I ordered a bloody mary, and give him my table number. I guess they go by the honors system.   The self seating system can be a little chaotic, and you may have to wait around for people to leave. Many people park themselves at a table and stay for what seems like hours. The patio is dog friendly and the staff is very accommodating with dogs, but be warned that it is a little cramped and may not be suitable for larger breeds.  We polished off our decadent chocolate filled croissant. It was perfect. My bloody mary was awesome too, brimming with garden goodness. My only complaint is they are damn expensive. $9. Kind of ridiculous for a mid day cocktail.  The 30 minute wait turned into a 45 minute wait. The staff apologized profusely for the delay. I guess the kitchen got slammed unexpectedly. Luckily we had the day off and no where else to go, so we didn't mind too much.  My hubby and I both had the egg sandwich, but mine without bacon. It was scrumptious. Every ingredient was top notch. My only complaint about the sandwich is that on the menu it said it has avocado when actually it is guacamole. The problem with this guacamole is that it was full of raw onion. I DESPISE raw onion. If I would have know I would have skipped the guac. May sound finicky but I scraped off every piece of onion off the sandwich before I ate it.   We also shared a side of breakfast potatoes which were cooked perfectly. Crispy on the outside, tender on the inside. Yum.  The staff is helpful, warm, and a lot of fun. Even with the raw onion issue, the expensive bloody mary, and the long wait for food, the exceptional service and yummy food made up for the shortcomings. We look forward to our next visit and can't wait to sample the rest of the menu.",

    "text": "The Public Market Cafe is like going over to your friends house who's a great cook and eating. Its a little different each time and the service is friendly but definitely not professional. Since its a bit different each time I can understand why the reviews a bit mixed.  The fried chicken and prime rib are my favorites. Plus a small pitcher of beer (2.5 glasses) is only $5-7 depending on the type of beer your order.  I really enjoy the homemade, fresh taste here!",

I am usually in here around breakfast time, so I end up getting either a pastry or the breakfast burrito. I recommend the pop tarts, they're super good! I also always get a coffee, which they brew beans from Cartel, another local favorite of mine. You order your coffee at the register and it pops up over at the bar, which is unique, but gets me to see the other side of the market as well. My favorite time to come by is when any of the Farmer's Markets are going on outside. I recommend this place!",
