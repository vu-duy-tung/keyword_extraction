    "text": "Yet another reincarnation of Margaritaville, Salt seeks to deliver an upbeat nightlife scene with flair that can compete with Westgate's mainstays.   I like what they've done with the environment, as there's quite a bit of seating (albeit outoors), but the dance floor is still full. The lighting is dark enough and the music is loud enough to feel like a nice nightclub, but not so overboard you can't sit down and socialize with a small group. Having lots of space makes that easier.   The beer selection is average, and for $12 you can get a *gigantic* brew, which will save you a trip.   I just wonder when it'll live up to its full potential. As far as I could tell, the second floor wasn't being utilized at all. It would be really cool, and offer a sort of lounge aspect other bars in the area don't, so what's the deal? Also it's incredibly difficult for the 2-3 bartenders in the general population area to keep up. I'm sure these are just hiccups and they'll continue to offer a good experience, it's just that coming here was more vanilla than it should have been.   With regards to the food, I probably won't come here for that. Just please tell me the nachos have retained their awesomeness, because nothing else matters. =)",

My friends ordered the carne asada tacos, shrimp tacos, and an enchilada. We also got the cheese chimi for dessert. Highly recommend it if you love cheesecake as much as i do! The server was super sweet as well. We ended up coming back at around 10:30pm since it turns into more of a bar/club. They remove the tables at the bottom and it turns into a dance floor. It was pretty poppin' lol I'm used to going out on Mill Ave and in Old Towne and this place definitely has a different vibe to it, but it was still really fun! The crowd is generally more older and more tamed lol",

There was a game on but the restaurant was not very busy. We sat at the bar and had great service from Miranda, the bartender.  My wife had the chicken fajitas and I had the Carnitas Nachos. My nachos were huge, a 12\" plate piled 6\" high with chips, queso, jalapenos and carnitas drizzled with a lime chives sour cream. Very good.  My wife enjoyed her fajitas saying they were tasty and would definitely reorder.  Miranda was a great server as well as bartender.   We look forward to returning.",

Being In he restaurant industry in the past I have high expectations of servers and she met all of them. I will continue to go back to Salt on Sunday Funday .  Sydney will continue to bring customer back to salt as long as she is there, customers love good service with a smile and great attitude. Thank you for a great Sunday funday Sydney !",

We were seated the moment we walked in. Hostess was polite and chatty (which we all love!) our waitress arrived at our table in about 2 minutes after we seated, and took drink orders. Drinks came out within about 4 minutes. So far..so good! She came back after about 5 minutes and took our appetizer order and food order (at our request). Appetizer was out in about 7-8 minutes and about 5 minutes after we were finished with it, our food came out. Food was pretty good, shrimp could have been just a tad warmer but it was still all good food. A big burley, nice guy (manager or owner I am assuming) came by and asked if everything was good and if we needed anything, and about 5-6 minutes after that, a younger gentleman with his hair pulled back came and checked to see if we were doing alright. Our waitress was very attentive, and met all of our requests in a really timely manner (we were sure to leave a great tip). As we were leaving the manager(?) that had checked on us previous met us by the door to ask how our visit was. We chatted for a few minutes. Super nice guy. For sure we will go back again, and hopefully always have such good service and food.",

We sit down and have a friendly smile on out faces excited to get some drinks before they Chainsmokers concert when have sat there for over 10 mins without out a \"Hi\" or a \"hello be right with you\". So finally I ask a little abruptly excuse me can we order some drinks. Never was checked on after we got our first round and had to ask for second. I  have worked in the restaurant business for over ten years and was supper disappointed in the service for what looked like such a fun place to go. Next time I will choose Mcfaddens which was such a blast and great service.",

I called back on 12/26 to check one more time,  and I was told that they would be open at 11AM since the game didn't start until 2:25PM.  We arrived just before 11AM on 12/25PM to find that the restaurant was full with a wait by that point, and the information that I was given to be completely off base.  We decided to go else where to enjoy the day.  I've been to Salt a few times since they opened as I work in the Westgate area, but the experience Sunday had me questioning whether I want to introduce it to any of my friends or family.",

He was more concerned with the cleavage of a new guest to recognize my wife and I weren't too happy. After a third attempt to even get the guy to recognize us, I asked him to cancel two completely different drinks than we even ordered. He basically shrugged it off and ignored it like it was no biggy. Im sure our party was still charged for the drinks we waited over an hour for, and never got. Oh, forgot to mention, I watched him bring at least 20 drinks to other people in the immediate area that all ordered after us. Never will I ever return here. Gives the trendy restaurant title a very bad name. Bertos is better.",

We could tell Salt knew a crowd was coming. They were using a limited menu and had posted signs asking patrons to allow 45 minutes to an hour to get food after ordering and preparing \"groups of 1 or more\" in other words, everybody, for an automatic 20% gratuity. After being seated, we were literally ignored. After 30 minutes, we caught a server going by and asked if she would take our order. Over an hour later, most of our food came, but not all, and half of what we were brought was cold. Our drinks hadn't been refilled. As we began discussing our issue with one of the managers, he accused us of seating ourselves. So that explained why we had been ignored. I was very understanding of the situation due to the crowd and all until that point. I had the hostess tell him that was not the case and that she had seated us. I could not believe they had treated us that way based on a False assumption. The manager never apologized.",

    "text": "My Honey and I dined here yesterday for the second time. Our experience the first time, eight days earlier, was so terrific we couldn't wait to come back. Initially it was just the two of us seated at the bar, but a friend unexpectedly joined us. We tried a ceviche appetizer; having sampled such ware from St Maarten to Belize for comparison, this was the best either of us have ever tried in the US. And the portion was enormous! We discussed adjusting our orders appropriately next time.  I already knew how tasty the Baja shrimp and the fish tacos were, so those were a given. Based upon so many positive reviews, I had to try the potato tacos. Mashed potatoes, jalapenos  and cheese? Shut up and take my money! They were very good. That said, I'm not sure I'll ever need one badly enough again to displace shrimp or fish. Big, big thanks to Lyssa for letting us hang out with her. As both bartender and wait staff, she rocks. She was very helpful with suggestions on the menu. In addition, she was ideally attentive without being remotely intrusive. Major kudos.  We are (well, I am...) old enough that we'll probably never come clubbing here after dark, but we will so be back for lunch.",

We sat on the outside part of the bar while waiting for the dodgers game. We came here for spring training so March... yeah I know. Took a while to write. They had beers listed on their menu and the first 2 or 3 that we ordered they were out of or didn't carry. Then why are they on the menu. By the way she looked so annoyed with us when we were trying to order. Shot us an eye roll here and there. I was like woah lady! I've never seen you before in my life. Then we ordered Modelos which we assumed was draft since I thought we seen a handle for it and this place is called TACOS AND TEQUILA so I'd assume. Well their crappy rude \"bartender\" brought us bottles. When we asked about it on draft she said \"bottles is all we have right now\" and walked away. Rude. She didn't communicate at all. Ask a question and when we answered she would just walk away. Took forever to flag her down for our check. Needless to say we didn't order another beer and didn't order food. We took our business elsewhere. I took a picture of her so management can smack some manners into her. I know that seems petty but seriously this chick had a major attitude problem for absolutely no reason",

Tonight was the last straw, he took my ID said it didn't look like me and asked for my debit card. Apparently neither my signature nor my picture were mine. He was walking away with both and said if I wanted them back I had to get a cop. I demanded my debit card back because why would they keep it. When I get to the cop well obviously the cop didn't want to come with me. So then he said to bring the guard which he obviously wasn't going to do. I then proceed to talk to the manager who seen me plenty times and was the third person to apparently think it wasn't me either. Luckily for me two cops were walking by when I asked for their assistance. They gave the cop an actual fake which wasn't mine so when they were trying to verify me, it  didn't match up. After someone i know explains I've been there plenty times they \"suddenly\" realize they gave the WRONG ID to the cops. Behold it was me after all. Rude overall I did not receive an apology from neither the \"guard\" nor the manager. Beyond disappointed. I've heard similar stories but didn't realize it would happen to me as I had been there many times. Please be careful with your IDs and debit cards.",

The waiter couldn't hear us because of the background noise. He thought we ordered chicken tacos at first until I corrected the misunderstanding. The chicken breast was tough and overcooked. I'm a home cook and could do much better. The black beans were cold, i.e. room temperature. The cilantro rice was just rice and no cilantro flavor at all. The high tops and other customers were so close to our booth that the waiter and customers had to squeeze by in single file. To end on a positive note, the red, white and blue chips were good and the salsa had a nice cilantro flavor with just the right amount of heat. Two things you can't argue with are money and success.

It's one thing to kick out a person for being drunk but they kicked out our entire group and we were not the least bit. Will not EVER be returning. When questioned about it, they said we had to leave and that they didn't have to tell us anything. Hate is alive in this world we live in.",

The server was slow.  we did not like the guacamole (which I actually asked for a sliced avocado) or the asada. Best thing was the hot corn tortillas.  I agree with the other review below on the prices.  We were charged more than what it says on the menu. I questioned it and she said she would check on it.  She dropped the bill off, never mentioned it and nothing had changed with the total!  We won't go back and they won't last long with poor service and food!",

You can get much better Mexican food for a cheaper price and bigger portions. For a bar it was decent, but I wouldn't go back for the food.",

    "text": "Two problems with this place. 1. They use two menu's - one is for nights with an event (Coyotes etc) and the other is non event. The event menu has half the items the regular menu has including charging $17 for a Carne Asada burrito, while the normal price is 9 bucks. Sounds like they need new cooks because I do not recall Cheesecake Factory having that arrangement. It is just pure greed. They also jack up the beer prices as I paid over $5 for a Bud Light bottle. Go during a non event night if you don't want to get ripped off or better yet, go to another place named SALT that is not owned by someone from Seattle.   2. This is a major Seattle Seahawks bar as evidenced by the green balloons and hundreds of supporters filling the bar two weeks ago before the Cardinals/Seahags contest. This should not be occurring in the shadow of the Cardinals stadium, but this is par for the course in Arizona. Blame the Westgate owners for letting this occur and boycott this place (and Whisky Rose) if you support Big Red.  P.S. Seahawks lost, so now what...you gonna put some red balloons up now?",

If you want to go for lunch because you work in the area, it is great to grab a bite to eat. I was greeted by one of the sweet hostess that are at the front and was sat immediately. The restaurant was clean, which I know is something people look at when they are trying somewhere new. Surprisingly enough I was \"table touched\" by both the manager and the owner. I felt so welcomed here that I now go back all the time.   They also on some night have celebrity DJ's that will spin there. Not exactly time for the family but these event usually happen later at night. Other then that a completely awesome family restaurant to bring your kids and enjoy the huge fountain in the middle of West gate.

No seats so my group went outside and sat on a community table, then I was told I could not sit here because I had to get someone to sit me by the waitress.  I went up front asked to sit where I was just at, which was available, went back to the table with menus this time and surprisingly got the same waitress who just told me that I could not sit here.  LAME and stupid.  She gave me a lame excuse that people just come and sit anywhere ... well if you want money they should be able to sit where they want right???   Almost left because of her, but stayed and had an okay time.   Customer Friendly no-  I been to places where the people say that it's okay I sit here and THEY BRING YOU THE MENUS, not where you have to go to host to get permission where you just sat and for them to bring you the menus.  It's just lame.  I don't care if this place makes because with this experience they should sink.",

Service: As far as atmosphere they changed a little bit, It's still looks a bit Margaritaville, They just changed it a little bit kind of Western in looking other than that they have a long ways to go the food wasn't that good the service totally sucks they were not very friendly at all mean a few friends sat down and then immediately the waitress came over and said we cannot sit there we had to go through the hostess, so we went back up to the front and then the hostess just put us back at the exact same table how stupid was that, The whole time we felt rushed she kept coming by do you need anything ask for some this to get something for us and the menu on us it was totally uncomfortable and ridiculous and the drinks were awful they taste like their water down I would never go to this place again but once again this is just my opinion but the party that I was with felt the same way I think they would need seriously a lot of improvement may be a whole new staffing, it was not a very popular place it was just very few people inside the place or the restaurant is just to entirely too big for the amount of customers are going to get through there which is not going to be very much I suspect it won't last very long.   $$$  The cost of the drinks and food were just competitively priced just your normal type of pricing maybe in time they will improve so maybe if I see the place really full and might pop in again but it's unlikely this so much more other better places to go to.",

If the staff had been paying attention in the food safety course they were required to take, they would know that food safe temperatures are from 39 degrees to 140F. The chicken on her salad was sitting comfortably at 75, which isn't good. My enchiladas had the taste of canned chicken. All of it had been sitting around for a long time before we got there. The manager told me that their last health inspection was an \"A\" but I was unable to verify that.   For $16 a plate they should make the food fresh. There's no reason to recycle lunch leftovers for dinner. Furthermore nothing we had required intense preparation afterwards.   Everyone has bad days, but that still doesn't make it acceptable. The drinks were good, but were they good enough to risk getting sick? Not for us.   The manager did the right thing and took care of our ticket. That's why this review is two stars.",

Took almost 30 min to get food which isn't too unusual but I ordered just tacos. My drink tasted Water down so I had to order beer instead to even it out. That wasn't until I waited another 30 min for my beer. Mind u I had my food sitting in front of me the whole time so by the time I got to my food it was cold. I would never come here again nor would I recommend it to any one. Mind u in writing this evaluation while waiting for the waitress to achnknowledge my existence as a table. Bottom line crappy service, food was below par and drinks suck unless u get beer. Horibble place if u can avoid this place at all cost.",

    "text": "So I live in this area, but first time to Salt and decided to stop in for drinks and an appetizer on a slow Friday afternoon.  We were seated outside and the atmosphere is really nice.  However when the hostess seated us I mentioned that the table looked like it hadn't been cleaned off and she looked at me with a blank stare. So I grabbed a napkin and wiped it off myself.  So the waitress finally shows up and we all order house margaritas and chips/salsa. Margaritas were pretty good, but not much alcohol in them; chips weren't anything special- the red and blue corn kind right out of a Tostitos bag!  Salsa was bland and not much more than ground up tomatoes. To top it off, there's no A La Carte menu, so even if you'd like to try one taco, you're forced to order an entire meal.  But what makes my first impression here even worse was lack of service.  Waitress literally disappeared after dropping everything off. We sat there for over an hour and she never came back. We were one of only a few tables there. Had to beg her to get our bill!  So the 2 stars are for atmosphere, but zero stars for food/service.",

The first time when we ordered drinks the waitress insisted we give our credit card up front to open a TAB. We assumed she was confused about the TAB policy, but still it was off-putting. The second time our waitress didn't come to us until about 10 minutes after were were seated and the guy (manager on duty?) took our drink orders and hunted down the waitress. Waitress was nice but not attentive; we should have gotten refills more than the one time.   Food is meh and overpriced. The menu is very limited and considering how few people there were in the restaurant the food took a long time to get to us.   We really wanted to like this place but I don't think we'll be back, unless it's to check out any happy hour they might have. But we definitely won't eat here again.",

    "text": "Came here to pregame and celebrate my daughter's birthday before heading to University of Phoenix arena for the Taylor Swift concert. Apparently our party of 8 got here just in time to beat the crowd and we're luckily seated immediately. Throughout our entire meal there was an extremely long line out the door.   Considering it was 105 degrees outside, I really wish they had closed the doors and windows surrounding the perimeter of the restaurant.  Their outdoor patios have misters and I'm convinced the people out on the patio were better off than those of us inside because what little air conditioning they had was just blowing out with all the open doors and windows.   Our server was very nice, but unfortunately our food took a long time to arrive. At least we weren't in a hurry. The good news is the food and drinks were both delicious!! I had the carnitas chimichanga and had a Speedy Gonzales cranberry drink. Also had the Blue Hawaiian margarita and tried my husband's Speedy Gonzales blueberry cocktail. All were yummy. They had a tequila rep there who came by our table as well and offered us all free shots of the tequila he was promoting. It was very smooth and quite good. If this review were based off of food and drink taste alone, I would have given it a five. Honestly, I would have given the overall experience a four, but deducted an extra star (wish we could do half stars!) because I made the mistake of leaving my credit card there. I realized it once we were at the concert and tried to call the restaurant several times over many hours but they never answered the phone. I ended up having to cancel it when it would have been easier to just swing by and pick it up.",

But last time I came with bae we discovered the fried ice cream, which tops everything else. It's peeerfectly crunchy, creamy, sweet, savory and cinnamony. We MOPPED this dessert unlike any other dessert. Seriously, it's so good that I plan on coming back to order it when I'm having a bad day because I know it'd cheer me up even more than my DOG. The power of delicious food is unstoppable. Go you, Salt.  --- I'm separating this part because I want to note that my review is based solely on the stellar meals at Salt, not nightlife. I like to party at Westgate but I honestly never go to Salt late at night because the DJ isn't great, dudes are pushy, and nobody dances. 1 star nightlife, 5 star day time tho!",

    "text": "They advertise a special on Facebook, if you spend $25 you can get a free T-shirt or hat. Out of 5 different designs, they had 1 style and a size small left. The only reason I decided to give them a try was for the t-shirt but they didn't have the one I wanted or the correct size. So much for take your pick! Ordered the Steak and eggs, Food is mediocre. Their country potatoes are horrible. They were cold, hard and taste old. The margarita's are good and that's about it. My husbands beer was warm. Their service was awful, we waited 10 mins to get our drinks and then we had to wait 15 mins just to pay after finishing. The waitress was even in our area and skipped by and never came back, eventually someone else ran our bill. Never coming back. Now I see why they have low ratings.",

    "text": "If i could give 0 stars I would thats how bad I this review is.  My husband and I went to Ace Con and decided to go out to dinner. We had seen this place a few times but each time it was busy due to hockey games. It was a friday night and Con was going on. It was not busy which surprised us. we got seated quickly which was great but the table was a seasaw. When we brought it up it was quickly dismissed or given an excuse. We ordered an appetizer which was a quesadilla and for $12.00 I thought it would be a decent size. Nope. It was 4 small slices. I was not impressed. I ordered the small chimis and my husband got the burrito. In between each of these the times seeing our waitress was only 2x. The last time we saw her she was standing at the bar talking with the other waitresses. it took a very long time to get our food.   So finally we get our food and for my dish the meat was bland. No flavor at all. What saved this was the cheese they added on top. My husband who hardly uses hot sauce poured extra onto his burrito and I asked why? He said the meat was so bland he had to give it some spice. He was disappointed because all the cheese was at the sides of the burrito instead of mixed in with the meat. He also said that the re fried beans had the texture of a paste. He said that there were no beans.   So no i do not recommend this place even if it was slow the waiters/waitresses still just wanted to be on their phones and chat with one another. The meat has no flavor and the portions are small. Sorry I'll pass and head to chipotle.",

I ordered the nachos, and the portion was huge. I noticed they had a half size option but didn't realize how huge it really would be! They don't seem to have consistent closing times however, as they rushed to close out the tab pretty much as soon as we ordered and I have been in Westgate and they weren't even open.",

Advice: order shots til you're hammered and stumble into the arena with a good buzz. Save your time not ordering the food or mixed drinks.",

Everything on the menu sounds amazing!!! If you're looking for a great place to eat I would hit this spot up. If you like your sports they have plenty of TVs to watch all your sports. They have Happy Hour Mon-Fri from 3-6!! Would HIGHLY recommend this place for great food!!!",

    "text": "If you are looking to sit around for an hour and cancel your order because it's taking too long this is the place to go.   So we go here on a Saturday night before a Coyotes game. I get it, most of the places in Westgate are going to be busy so we are expecting a wait time to sit and that the food will take awhile. This place though took incompetence to a new level. First of all their system of taking down your phone number and calling you when your table is ready is just an awful system. Can they not afford the pager system? While we were waiting we saw the host try and call numerous people and not talk to anyone. In addition we saw couples come after us and get seated right away while we were waiting. Maybe they were in line before and were being called back, sure didn't look like it though.   After waiting a decent amount of time the hostess comes up to us and says they can seat us right away but it would be with another couple. The game started at 7 and this was maybe 530 so at this point we just wanted to get seated. What an awkward position to put people in though. I thought maybe the table would a bigger table so it wouldn't be that weird. Nope, high top small table with 4 chairs. I mean we couldn't get this table to ourselves? We had to share with another couple? Really weird. Luckily the other couple ended up being really nice and we shared some nice conversations.   We put our order in as soon as we sat down, I'm thinking that we still have a pretty good shot of eating and getting out of there to get to the game at 7. Needless to say that did not occur. We waited and waited, our server, the poor girl reassured us that our food was coming out soon. She went to the back to check on it and she came out and said the kitchen was super backed up and they had some sort of big foul up. We ended up just canceling our order and paid for our drinks so we wouldn't miss the start of the game. Our service was really nice but where was the manager? No explanation or apology from management.   I get that its a busy night but you have to be prepared for it. Our server mentioned that a ton of people ended up canceling their orders as well. All in all a miserable dining and customer service experience.",

The carne asada steak was tasty with guacamole and pico only. The corn tortilla used make for a poor first impression and also take away from the overall, the carne tacos are ok for the $8 paid.  This other taco plate was un-breaded fish. Very bad texture and way over the top spicy which wasn't described on the menu. I love very spicy, super spicy food but the was totally out of context with the tacos.  Really wired to me.  They were $10 with rice and beans.  Although the price was ok for the ok food, there is absolutely nothing that would bring me back to eat again. It does look like a great place to have some beers and watch the Cards!",

Outside seating was not able to accommodate our party of 6 so we sat inside, we were the only ones inside so our server was good. Food was bland, overpriced and not a good value. Carnitas tasted like pot roast, no seasonings. Tacos were very nondescript. $4.00 for each bowl of chips and salsa :( $11.00 Margaritas tasted like they came right out of a bottle of cheap mix, bloody marys were $12.50. Our bill for 4 adults, 2 kids was $167, we don't mind paying for good food, but this was horrible. We did speak to manager politely, he just gave us a blank stare. Not good customer service.",

We were with 2 other couples who we really wanted to spend time chatting with. The noise level of the music made conversation impossible. The server twice tried to get the volume turned down for us but w/o success. We asked for the manager, who also said he'd turn it down but it never happened.  The food and margaritas were quite good, as was the service, but we won't be back unless we are in the mood for really loud music that's not of our choosing.",

The service was very good the minute I walked in I was acknowledged and walked to a table by karissa who ended up also being my server. She was extremely kind and had no problems answering my questions upon her recommendation I had the Carne Asada tacos. They were very good I found the sweet taste rather interesting couldn't quite figure out what it was however a nice touch. Karissa came by the table several times to make sure I was ok and was not pushy which tends to happen way to often at restaurants. I was also checked on by what seemed to be a manager which was refreshing to see a manager making table rounds unfortunately I did not catch his name. The atmosphere in this restaurant was wonderful very relaxed which was much needed after a long day. For dessert I ordered the deep fried banana split which I have never heard of and it was amazing! A deep fried banana, three scoops of ice cream, whipped cream, fresh strawberry, slice of grilled pineapple, and caramel drizzle! Worth every calorie!! Needless to say I had a pleasant experience thanks Karissa!",

We were there just sitting at a table that's outside and around 1245am, one of my friends had decided that he wanted to buy a table. We were drunk, but not horribly drunk to where we shouldn't have been in the bar. My friend that had bought the table left to go to the bathroom right after (2 minutes) they had given us our bottle. My other friend and I hadn't even drank from the bottle, and while the person who bought the table was in the bathroom, they escorted us out and told us that we were too drunk to be there. So, my friend that just bought a table, which we were around for and the girl we got escorted out by, was the one taking our order to get the table was there -- if we were that drunk, why didn't you deny us the table before we bought it? Instead, they took my friends money, and got the two bottles of alcohol that weren't even drank out of to sit at a table for 10-15 min. The only good thing about this place was the music. We won't be coming back :)",

    "text": "OMG, what a great place and what a great event. Little did the gang of Elites know that in addition to our event there would be a hockey game, a biker event and St. Patricks Day events going on at the same place. And you know what, it did not matter one bit, everyone from all the events had a great time celebrating whatever it was that they were there for. Our event was fantastic. The food was plentiful and great tasting. Our servers were friendly and fast, the owner/manager took amazing care of the 30 or so Elites that were, as usual, being a loud and rowdy bunch. Once the drinks were ordered there was delivered a plate of nachos that was on initial view a thing of beauty. It was hard to dig into it as it looked so good, but once it was breached, our hungry group savored every bite. We then ordered from a menu, I had the cheese enchilada. It was one of the best I have ever eaten, and eat it I did, even though I was quite full. I could just not stand to see that delight sit there uneaten. Everyone to an Elite was  happy, happy, happy.  We then waddled our full stomachs over to the PopBar. A place like I have never seen and it is hard to describe, but it can be understood with a picture and a few words. The picture is below, the words are, you choose what bar of ice cream, gelato or sorbet you want (and there are loads of yummy choices), then it goes to an area with   about 20 different things to roll or coat the bar in, you name it, they got it. I real delight....the whole evening was a real delight.  Thanks Hailey !!!!",

I've been here weekdays, weekends, all hours of the day and NEVER have I received anything but AMAZING service and delicious food. From margaritas, wine, strong cocktails, even Shirley Temple's, to tacos, enchiladas, carne asada burritos, and all ensaladas-NOTHING disappoints!   Absolute favorite is the traditional enchilada with green sauce. It's so much food, I always get to take home leftovers for a midnight snack or breakfast. Also love how they don't skimp on the cilantro in the salsa!  The interior is like none I've ever seen-the decor is visually appealing. Not to mention this destination has several ambiances-sit outside and people watch close the outside bar, sit at the inside bar where there are 7+ big screen tvs viewable from anywhere in the restaurant, take a booth or table on the main floor where happy hour takes off, or if you're wanting something more intimate-the elevated bar off to the right of the dance floor is perfect with plenty of big screen tvs as well.   Music selection is on point weekend nights! And their instagram giveaways are awesome!",

It's fine if they want to put their own spin on the dish, but when you completely change what people are expecting, you should rename it. This was a tortilla or two smothered in cheap cheese with a tad bit of sauce (not even enchilada sauce) with large chunks of chicken on top. It comes with a bowl of refried beans and some bland rice. It was the most boring meal in recent memory. No chips or salsa was served. No garnishes like fresh cilantro or maybe a lime wedge. It lacked any sort of culinary imagination. The service was no better. I asked the server for a couple more minutes, she came back 15 minutes later. Very disappointed by this place. I would not recommend it based on my single experience.",

Appreciate your input in further supporting my review that the service at this trash establishment is awful. Keep up the good work, your success in running a top-notch establishment goes without saying. But in reality - I'm sure you're doing the best you can. It has to be difficult having interaction with all of your unsatisfied customers when it's nearly everyone that has the misfortune of paying this garbage heap a visit.

We stopped in later in the evening during the week since we had some houseguests staying with us. We were greeted and seated right away which I always appreciate. The only downside to this night was that they had all of the doors open and it was pretty chilly but I want deduct points for this as I'm a wuss and always cold.  We all ordered a margarita while we chose our menu entree. The house margarita was actually pretty darn good! I couldn't complain at all with this choice! For dinner I got the enchiladas, which is always my go to. While our dinner was being prepared, our waitress, even thought it was busy, was sure to keep checking on us refilling drinks as needed.   Finally our food arrived and I was honestly blown away. The presentation was beautiful and I was ready to dive in! I cannot lie, I didn't expect much as this wasn't your traditional Mexican restaurant but the flavor was phenomenal!! It was one of those \"I know I should stop eating but can't\" moments.  If you are in the area, I highly recommend and will be back!!!",

We ordered our selection we were surprised that one of her tacos was not made correctly. I tried getting the managers attention without any luck. Wife became frustrated and approached the staff and management. New tacos where delivered but a No time did the management stop by our table to inquire about our service or satisfaction of the food. With this type of management, I would assume that this establishment won't be around very long.",

Also, why does management think that having a person in both the women's and men's bathrooms to hand you a towel for a tip is a good thing? Had to wait in line for the sink cuz this creepy woman with a crazy amount of crap for sale, took up about half the sink area. Management get a clue. Patrons deserve to go to the bathroom in your establishment without being hassled in the restroom. Just gross!!  On a more positive note... Ate at the bar before a concert at Gila River. Bartender was awesome.",

Brent greeted us at the entrance and told us about the specials and offered to extend the happy hour because it was our first time. It was because of him,  were decided to come in and eat.  He did a good job of luring us in!   We took advantage of the half- price burrito special (yum on the carne asada!). Loved the cilantro rice that came with. The blood orange margarita was divine.  The tortilla soup was less soup and more mush,  but the manager did right by us. Army took care of our every need,  and checked in frequently on how we were doing.  Great service!  Overall, a great experience. We will come back!",

You would honestly think it was just your everyday bar that gets lit on the weekends!! Best believe this place was jumping!! Music was a really good mix! Place is actually bigger than I realized. You can bet if this place had it's own standalone building it'd be one of the best spots in the valley. That said having it in Westgate is hard to beat. Dance floor can be pretty packed but I think it's forgotten during the day this is full-on restaurant. The tables and chairs are just moved outside. All in all it's awesome spot!! I will for sure be back sometime soo hopefully.",

Our waitress was very patient with us and very precise considering how many of us there were. The entire time she kept a smile on her face and was very friendly. We had so many appetizers it was hard to keep up, but the loaded fries are a must if you come here! I had the chipotle shrimp tacos and holy moly were they delicious that sweet chipotle sauce is what gave it that extra unique taste. I had the tortilla soup instead of the beans and rice, and this is the only place where I was disappointed. I felt the tortilla soup was to think that I could not finish it. It had a good taste, but it could have been less thick.  I also had the house margarita because my friend told me they are really good here, and he was right! I'm not huge on margaritas, but this one was very yummy! It did however not have the salt or sugar on the rim of the glass which was odd to me. Anyhow I will be coming back to try some more of their different items on their menu and hopefully their great customer service continues.",

    "text": "Hubby and I had dinner here last night before the Elton John concert. We weren't expecting much other than decent margaritas and tacos. Immediately after being seated, a fairly drunk bar patron \"borrowed\" part of our table to reorganize the 4 drinks he bought. Unfortunately, he spilled a large amount on the table and floor. This was, obviously, not the fault of employees, but after telling no less than 6 employees, all of which said they would take care of it, not one person cleaned it up while we were there. We did have some entertainment watching patrons and staff avoid and/or slip through the mess.   Moving on to drinks - our first 2 margaritas were quite tasty, although far more ice than drink. I liked my husband's Cadillac margarita enough to order one for myself. Our 2nd round of margaritas were absolutely awful! They tasted like a Budlite Limearita. We mentioned how awful they were to our server. Her response was to glance at the bar and mention who she thought made them. At no time did she offer to remedy the situation by replacing the gross drinks or remove them from the bill.   I ordered 2 tacos with a side of their tortilla soup. Tortilla soup is pretty hard to mess up, but this version was awful! The server told me it was a cup, but a large bowl that came out, and I wish I'd never ordered it. My tacos were bland and unremarkable. My husband ordered the green Chile burro. The filling was a glob of grossness with very little meat. Unappealing to the eye and stomach.   Heading to the concert, we both felt ill and wondered if we'd be sick. We will not be returning!",

Found Salt and decided to give it a try with my boyfriend last night before the Disturbed concert.  No waiting, very open restaurant and nice bar area as well. Our waitress was great; friendly and fast.  My boyfriend got the steak and I got the potato tacos. I absolutely loved them! It's hard for me to find vegetarian or vegan tacos that just don't consist of assorted vegetables and a bunch of lettuce. But these were better than I expected. Would definitely come back when in the area/ coming to another concert",

I go up to the GM and advise him that they have us mistaken. I told him to go check with the Male bartender who served me. He went and confirmed that it was not us. I than ask the GM how are you going to fix this since we was wrongly accused and perp walked out. He said nothing.

Three things stuck out from the experience:   1) Quality of food. To be blunt, I've had cafeteria food that was more appetizing. If anything stood out on my plate, it was the browning lettuce strips on the side. The quesadillas were underwhelming. The sour cream was ok but runny, and it filled only a 1/4 of the tiny plastic cup. The taco plate had three small tacos with two big cups of rice and beans obviously designed to fill you up.  2) Service. The waitress was nice but apparently unprepared. She couldn't recall the seasonal beers on tap. We had to ask her to bring us several things after the meal was delivered: 1) water, 2) salsa for the meal, and 3) extra sour cream.  3)  Menu. Here I was mystified as there were not a lot of distinct choices. I appreciate reducing costs and having a simple menu, but many of the dishes stated they had rice and beens in them, which also happens to also accompany the dish!",

    "text": "If I could give less than one star, I would.  We have eaten in some great places while here for the Fiesta Bowl, but this was not one of them.  If this was a review of the waiter, I would give 5 stars, but the food was awful.  First of all, they could not produce the margaritas we ordered because they ran out.  Strike one.  We ordered beer instead and they compensated by upsizing.  We ordered a trio, and it was delivered to the table next to us.  Strike two.  When the trio finally arrived, the queso was so watered down it was like the consistency of milk.  Finally the entrees arrived and they were lukewarm.  Strike three.  The tamales tasted like Texas BBQ meat with BBQ sauce poured on top.  If there was cumin or cilantro seasoning, it was well hidden.  I was taught to never leave food on your plate, but they were so bad there was no way to finish.  The ONLY bright spot was that the waiter tried really hard to make it all OK.  This was LSU headquarters for the game.  True tigers fans who can cook great dishes would have never picked this place if they sampled the food first.  Even great staff can't make up for crappy food!",

Always smiling and appeared to love what she's doing.  Food was amazing. Full of flavor and, honestly, I couldn't eat it all because the portions were more than I could eat. While I didn't order dessert this time, I'm happy to be back. I'm not from this part of the country but will definitely make the effort next time I'm here to come back. Great job management and staff. Well done.",

    "text": "Brought to you by the same guy who owns Whiskey Rose next door.  Salt is being touted as a modern Mexican food joint.  It is located in the old Margaritaville spot in the center of Westgate (aka Restaurant Cemetery).  I tried the shrimp ceviche a carne asada quesadilla.    The ceviche had pieces of zucchini in it and was a good size.  But it did not taste freshly made and was overpowered with lime juice.  It needed some heat and less citrus.  It was 14 bucks for about a cup and came with chips on the side.    The carne asada quesadilla was a good size and came with a tomatillo salsa on the side.  The tomatillo salsa was not good.  It needed more spices and heat.  The quesadilla was good but could have been better if they served it with a pico de gallo and sour cream or guac.  I believe it was $13.  The service was pretty good.  The place was dead right after training camp so that was a bad sign.    The beer menu was lousy.  Closest thing to craft was Big Wave by Kona.  Any modern place should have some modern beer no?  I'd take authentic Mexican food or street Mexican food with fresh chips and salsa anytime over this.  For the price, product, and beer selection I really don't think I'd have a reason to come back here.  Westgate has a collaboration of some of the most mediocre restaurant offerings in the valley unfortunately.  They could use some new blood.",

    "text": "I came here after the Mcgregor/Mayweather fight for a friends bday and another friends \"going away\" party. He had 2 VIP tables reserved. When we got there, it seemed like a fun place. Pretty spacious, the music was good, and all my friends were there. Well, as soon as the bottles came, they were gone since we had so many people in our section.  I resorted to getting my own drinks at the bar. My first issue was when my brother ordered 2 shots from the Asian girl at the bar on the second floor. As soon as she poured them and put them on the bar for us, my other friend quickly showed up and wanted a shot as well. I put my finger in the air and mouthed \"one more please\". She rolled her eyes, threw her arms up and mouthed \"really?!\".  We all looked at each other kind of shocked.  This was the first time EVER that I did not leave a tip.  Second issue was with the crowd that this bar/club attracts. A lot of \"westside thugs\". I know it's not the clubs fault but mix these type of guys with liquor and you'll have some problems. We were constantly \"mad dogged\" and shoved until my brother almost got into a fight with a really drunk up-to-no-good thug. This happened at the front patio. We were trying to get in between the 2 to prevent a fight. Security was nowhere to be found for assistance. Finally, we left at 2am. As we got to the parking lot, there was TONS of fights. I mean EVERYONE was fighting. Get bartenders with good/fun attitudes and make security more present INSIDE the bar and it would be better. For now, we won't be returning.",

She's super nice at least.  My friend and I ordered carnitas nachos and beers. The nachos were on a huge platter. And delicious with more than enough for two. Meat was shredded and tender, not stringy. Cheese sauce was good and a little spicy. Came with sour cream, salsa and jalapenos. Only reason they get 4 stars was that our order of nachos was dry inside. Once we ate the top, we were left with chips. After I pointed this out to the server, he right away got us more queso fundido. Perfect. Server was really attentive. Actually all the servers were really nice. Bartenders were great when I asked them for beer and shot combo suggestions. Beer on tap was typical of a Mexican restaurant.  The place becomes a dance club on weekends so they were clearing out tables as we ate, but we never felt rushed to leave.",

We were playing beer pong on the patio for my friends 21st birthday had a good time when my friend went to get a ball that bounced off the patio and out into the walkway and with no alcoholic beverage he went to go retrieve it not knowing he wasn't allowed and that we needed to find a security guard to go get it for us. Our friend ended up being told to go back around to the front(which is totally okay there was no argument) by a security guard Chester Brown who then went to the front and told security to not allow him back in. When we found out we all went to pay our tab and leave to McFaddens when Chester then approached our table very disrespectful saying \"you have an issue I wouldn't let your friend back in then get the fuck out.\" And would only answer \"he didn't have to do anything wrong i don't want him in here i can do whatever i want in here\" When I asked his name he told me it was none of my damn business so I left out the front entrance standing next to the ID podium to wait for the rest of our group when Chester then again followed me and very aggressively continued to approach me getting closer until he's back me up to the edge of the fountains still trying to argue with me when i had left to avoid confrontation. Another security guard had to step in and tell Chester to return back inside. I never caught the security guards name who then talked to me respectfully APOLOGIZING FOR HIS COWORKERS ACTIONS, and giving me Chesters name.",

When I arrived there, it took about 15-20 minutes for the bartender to take my order. I ended up ordering two drinks for myself because I didn't want to spend so much time waiting at the bar again. It's understandable that it was a busy night but I have never waited this long at places on Mill and in Old Town.  After that, my friends decided to head to the dance floor. One of them was talking to another guy and exchanging contact information when suddenly a security guard came up and asked them to walk outside. Now, I was there the ENTIRE time. My friend and the guy were doing absolutely nothing wrong. Followed them out and I realized that they were getting kicked out. The reason? Because they were talking. That's literally what security told us. God forbid people actually SOCIALIZE in a bar/club setting. No one was intoxicated. We respectfully asked why and tried to explain how that wasn't fair but they wouldn't budge and even called on West Gate's security to intervene.  I'm still baffled as of to why this happened. I read other reviews where people have gotten kicked out for no reason whatsoever. What's up with that? I went to Salt frequently and never had issues up until this point. I won't be going anymore if that's how their staff will treat customers.",

The only way we picked them out was they all had the same trendy, hipster black rim glasses.    We had a variety of tacos and nothing to write home about.  Highlight of the meal was the habanero salsa.   Tamales with chicken and verde sauce looked great but lacked meat and flavor.  They use cubed chicken which is odd because usually it's shredded....seemed like that's where the flavor usually happens is in the braised meat.   Good try STT.... Maybe you will get a manager in place to whip that place into shape and make it rock outside of the nightclub hours.",

We both had the taco salad, and we both agreed its missing some ingredients. So much so that we actually took what was missing from her daughter's plate to mix it up a little. My little cousin had the beef tacos which she mentioned is very dry.  We're from California and it felt like we ate at a Sharkey's. This food did not exactly seem 'authentic' to us. The atmosphere is beautiful and the Marquita helped. Neither of us finished the salad except for the shell, my little cousin was picking on our shell as well as she did not finish her meal.",

My husband had to wait quite some time to have bottled beer delivered to our table. The waitress just wanted to give us our check and get rid of us. Twin peaks restaurant was in the same vicinity and we highly recommend their establishment. Salt restaurant you should step up your game. Your competition is surpassing you in quality, service, and customer satisfaction.",

    "text": "I REALLY wanted to like this place. We went back last night wanting to take advantage of their taco Tuesday deals that we saw advertised. We were on our way back from an event, and I called to see what time they closed. I was told they closed at 2am. I hung up the phone and realized that they probably stop serving food earlier, so I called back and asked what time the kitchen closes, and I was told 11pm. Perfect.  So we head that way, and the a-frame sign advertising taco Tuesday is still outside. The security guy up front checked our ID and we went in, but there was no one at the hostess stand, so my husband asked the guy where we should sit if we want food. He said to sit anywhere. We went and picked a table and waited for a few minutes. A man who I am assuming was the manager came over and let us know that the kitchen was closing at 10pm and if we wanted to order food he could have them make it before they closed. It was a few minutes to 10pm. I told him I had just called and I was told it was open until 11pm, but that we could just leave if they were closing. We drove 30+ minutes down to Westgate to give the place another try because they said they would be open, and ended up eating at YardHouse instead. SO disappointing. We really liked their food and drinks last time, but service was the issue. It seems like that is still the theme and I wish that wasn't the case. If they're not open late, it's not a big deal - but the staff informing me of that when I called to ask 30 minutes before we got there would have saved a lot of frustration for us. The only redeeming event last night was that the manager was extremely nice and offered to accommodate us even though it would inconvenience them. He also responded to my last review offering to have us come in again, which was very nice - although I never took him up on it, and I wish I had, because I'm sure we would have had a better experience.",

After waiting an additional 10 minutes, waiting to order a 2nd beer, he finally.came by. after another 5 to 10 minutes came by to let me know he was waiting on the bar for the beer maybe something is wrong with the keg he said. Time to go, not interested in ordering food. waiting another 15 minutes to try and pay our bill. The manager finally walked by and asked if everything was ok. She didn't know their specials either.

We also got the nachos & added the carne asada(it's about $3 more). The nachos are huge! 4 or more people and definitely share. Wish they layered the toppings cause only the top has lots of stuff but not the bottom chips. The cheese is really good. We also ordered the buffalo wings. They were delicious & 8 comes in a order. Their margaritas are very colorful and look awesome! My brother likes the house margarita, it was a bit to strong for my taste(but I'm not a drinker).   On Tuesday's they have taco specials.   They do have an upstairs & a patio as well. The menu was a bit to hard to read cause some of the print came off or it's small writing & there's a design behind the words you can't even read.",

As soon as we were seated our server was there & he said he realized we'd be there for awhile so let him know when we needed anything else.   I thought that was awesome!!   I mean most servers want to bump you out for the next table.      It was loud in there.    Maybe just a preconcert party.   It was awesome but if you want a quiet place where you can have great conversations maybe don't stop in here before a show.     We ordered the nachos first.   THEY WERE AMAZING.   I think we got carne asada on them.   If this place wasn't so far we'd go back for those nachos ALL THE TOME!   And it was huge!   Four of us ate it all but I was sooooo full.

The entire time the hostess was looking over at us with an I'm oblivious  to the rest of the world look.    I can't comment on the food because we left. Didn't even get a lol at the menu.    On the way out I told the hostess to let her manager know we hadn't even received as much as a simple hello in the 15 minutes since we walked in.  The little self absorbed Twit actually laughed.

When we first got there it was still early so the DJ wasn't set up yet. First impression was that it's a pretty huge restaurant and bar area. Indoor and outdoor seating is available.   We left and stopped by a few other places then came back later when the DJ started to play music. Thankfully we didn't have to wait in line that long because as the night went on the line got crazy long!   Bathrooms didn't have any paper towels...and that was the case early on before it got really packed. Drinks were alright...seemed a little weak for my liking lol but we were already buzzed so maybe it was just me. So, that's why it's a 3 star rating.  Overall experience was so much fun. DJ was really good. We pretty much danced all night...music was really good but anytime with the girls is good times...  I'm sure we will visit here again when I come to visit!",

They also offer potato and veggie tacos for that price point. For $2 and $3, you had other types of tacos available.  Classic Margaritas are $8 but with Happy Hour, it is $2 off. I got mine with salted rim and blended so that raised the price. My drink was still very delicious and the tequila was nice and smooth.  We also ordered the hulking Salt nachos ($15) with carne asada ($3). It was well worth the price. They give a generous amount of home marinated steak. It has a nice tang and citrus finish. Wow! They melt shredded cheddar and cojita (maybe). It also has pickled sliced jalapeno, black beans and pico de gallo. You are a guacamole lover, you get 2 oz. for $3 more.   Davian took care of us, and were more than pleased with our meal and service. Thank you, Salt!",

Our waiter got to us pretty quickly and was friendly enough. We ordered two margaritas; a Michelob Ultra and my daughter who's not quite at the age to embide asked for a Prickly Pear virgin margarita. Our waiter informed us that , he 'could do that, but it would be the same price as a normal margarita'. What? Come again? My husband asked if he could have the tequila on the side then, since we were paying 10.50 for a virgin drink sans alcohol. He said , 'only if I charge you for the shot of tequila'. Did this make sense to anyone ? No. To be honest, I don't think it's legal to do that, either. Charging for an alcoholic beverage with no alcohol??? Make me understand how basically prickly pear kool aid minus alcohol is worth more than a few bucks? It's interesting that any other restaurant does this with a smile or recommends something else. His attitude was truly getting to me, after he said , 'well, the restaurant just wants you to order the actual drink, not make some virgin drink..', as he shrugged. Nice. I reluctantly ordered but would have left after that had we not been with two other people. We also ordered nachos to share and lemons to go with our waters, to which he said , 'that'll be awhile , as I have to go downstairs to get the lemons'. Several minutes later the lemons appeared and one had been squeezed; just gross. Our 10.50 margarita / non margarita and 11.00 cucumber margarita arrived in small plastic cups laden with tons of ice. My husband's beer didn't appear to be a pint in that small cup! How are you serving people in plastic cups and charging this much for drinks ? We aren't on spring break in some beach town! Again, wanting to cancel this nacho order and just leave , we didn't. The nachos arrive and they were okay but not anything to go nuts over. They were an ample serving but not filled with toppings for all the chips. 2 margaritas ; a domestic beer ; one virgin margarita ( full price as with tequila ) ; plate of non meat nachos - 60+ dollars .. all with mediocre to minus service. Trust me. This is great complex of cool bars and restaurants with actual glassware and great customer service.. just not here. Return factor- zero point zero zero.",

The carnitas in my bowl had good flavor and would like to try something different if I am ever back in the area.  Everyone seemed to like their food.  Salads, Burritos, build a bowl and tacos were among the things we ordered.    Service was good.  Not over the top but just solid.  We sat outside and it was nice to enjoy a beautiful night in Arizona.    Good option if you are in the area.",

    "text": "I want to give a 2 star, I really do, but as you read on, you'll see it's probably just 1.  The main reason - poorly managed!!  My family and I came here THE DAY BEFORE Cinco De Mayo, for my mom's birthday.  I called earlier in the week to make a reservation.  When my parents showed up before my husband and I, they said they didn't have my reservation.  I guess the hostess gave a little attitude about it but quickly changed her tune.  It was packed in there (there had been a motorcycle rally as well as a concert about to start at the arena next door), so they sat us upstairs, first in some dusty booth, then in the corner of their upstairs loft, by a bar that didn't have a tender.  We ordered 4 drinks and 3 shots, and our dinners.  They gave us complimentary guac and salsa with chips to offset the losing of the reservation.    THIRTY minutes later, our FOOD came out.  Where's the drinks? We asked.  Finally some busser brought our beverages about 10 minutes after we got our food.  They must have heard our grumbling, on top of our waitress yelling at her manager about how poorly the night was being run there, because a manager came to our table to apologize and offered to comp our drinks.  Our waitress was very sweet but unfortunately spread thin due to how busy it was.  This restaurant was not prepared, but I'm curious - they ARE aware of local events going on, AND it was CINCO DE MAYO, AND they're a MEXICAN restaurant!  HOW do you NOT prepare for that??  Waitress definitely had our best interest, and like I said, tore her manager a new one saying that waiting that long for food/drinks is unacceptable.  I guess they only had TWO bartenders working and the waiters had to get in line to submit their drink orders.  WTF??  I felt so bad for my mom because I PICKED this place to bring her and the family for her birthday dinner.  She said it would make for a funny story years to come.  Best part - comped drinks.  Worst part - everything else, ESPECIALLY POOR PLANNING ON MANAGEMENT'S PART!!",

Anyways, I got the veggie, Barbacoa, and Baja fish tacos. Veggie was weird, it had broccoli and cauliflower in it? No flavor, glad it was only the $1 taco. Fish was cod, not a bad taco but it was cold so wasn't good either. The barbacoa one was good. The meat was flavorful and the sauce mixed well with it. Wish I would've gotten three of those.  Overall, would come back if I'm desperate for a $1 taco but I think I can find much much much better tacos elsewhere.",

She went by Bre B. And oh boy did she make our night extremely special. Very attentive waitress, kept the laughs going for our table all night and never once did we feel uncomfortable asking for anything as she was the most genuine waitress I've ever had the pleasure of serving me. I will definitely be back and hope to be seated in which ever area she's tending to. She made our typical experience feel very homey and I was glad to give her a generous tip.

Sitting there, a couple dozen other people came in (a Coyote's game ended about 9:30) and were ignored by the staff, which was too busy cleaning so that they could leave ASAP at 10.    The margarita that I did have (with no salt!) was actually pretty darn good and would garner a 4 or 5 star rating!

I'm happy to be here, it's a cool spot, and I guess it's safe if they're being so rude at the door, but I mean don't show up drunk, you're not gonna get in. I like hip hop and I'm 27 so overall satisfied, they weren't hounding me about money when I got my drink so it's not too bad, but really if you have the choice, I recommend going somewhere else.  I'd be happy coming here if it was the last bar left on earth, but if you're in the Phoenix area there's so many other options.  I came here on a sunday before the Final 4 last game and nobody was here.  They even booked DJ Green Lantern who I've seen pack XS in Las Vegas on a Monday.  I started begging people on Periscope and Snapchat to come by but ultimately they cancelled his appearance.  This place is a joke, the people who run it only keep it going because there are so many tourists.  I can't wait until the Coyotes leave and all these whack Westgate bars just fail, I'm gonna laugh myself to sleep that night.",

I arrived at 11:45am and I can't tell you how long I waited to be asked about a drink.   My friends arrived around 12:05. Again, we waited a very long time for the waitress to greet them.   There seemed to be some training going on that day so lots of staff running around but no one being serviced. Two different tables yelled out \"can we please order\"   We didn't get items we ordered (like soup) .... silverware had to be asked for after the food was dropped off.   Waitress apologized when she dropped off the check about lack of service bringing up that they were learning the registers.   As I said, service was most certainly better in past visits. Food is good. Worth a visit but this time around ... not great in regards to service. Training of registers should not impact my dining experience.",

We just got our food, and the waiter asked how it was tasting- even though we'd not yet had a chance to take a bite.   When we arrived there was only two tables seated in our section including us- our server was very slow at coming back asking for drink and food orders.   The women's restroom was disgusting- sinks had rust and black mold on them. Toilet paper all over the floor of the stalls- I'm sure this hadn't been cleaned on a daily or hourly basis. It was gross.   This place charges $5 for chips and salsa- this is pretty basic at any Mexican restaurant and any of them that charge for something like that immediately is a red flag for me.   I think there is much this restaurant could improve on- our waiter although friendly was not attentive or paid attention to detail. Even though he wrote down our order on his pad, he still got it wrong. Not sure we will be back.",

We came in today during lunchtime they don't have any lunch specials from what I noticed today. I think the only downside is they charge you five dollars for chips and salsa I think that's pretty stupid. Like I get it the chips and salsa are super good. you have blue corn and you have a red chip awesome but you don't need to be charging for chips and salsa should totally be complementary. As for food I got the chipotle coconut shrimp tacos. The only downside is the tacos completely fall apart. Rice and beans pretty basic. The carne Asada tacos were OK I don't really prefer a sweet marinade on my tacos. But they were still very tasty.  I don't know what type of environment this place is at night time but for lunch with kids it definitely seems like an ideal place to go grab some lunch.",

They tried to get a heater for us on, but it didn't work, which was kinda a bummer. I was kinda cold. Our waiter was alright, he didn't really check on us that much.   First we ordered drinks and then our entrees. I just got a soda, some chips and salsa for the table and their enchiladas with carne asada. We got the chips and salsa first and those weren't bad. They were a good filler while we waited for our food. When my entree came out I was kinda confused. It didn't look like an enchilada at all. It was a few flat corn tortillas with cheese in the middle, carne asada thrown on top and some red sauce and more cheese to top it off. it wasn't that bad taste wise, I just don't think it looked like an enchilada at all. This place was just alright.",

    "text": "I love colorful chips! And it's downhill from there: I very much dislike leaving bad reviews but customer service to our friends and us was exceptional. When it was mildly amusingly bad she was simply acting disinterested or disgruntled at being asked for anything, and we asked for normal things like water when she'd asked. There reason however for 2 starts instead of 3, because my friends all enjoyed their meals, was that my plate of $13 nachos had cheese only on most of the top layer chips. It was an impressive amount of chips that towered tall and looked impressive but once I ate one chip I could see the plate was nothing more than an illusion of grandeur. Those cheese covered chips were delicious mind you, but but a sampling of the meal I desired.   It ended up being fine because if they had been thoroughly delicious nachos apart from the two I could've eaten more than a small appetizer portion and gained weight (sarcasm if you couldn't tell), so maybe they should get more stars for forcing me to keep my figure lol. Anyhow, my friends liked their food and less than 1/4 or 1/5 could be called nachos. The jalapenos were good though. At the end I had two (yes two) large, very full plates of empty, sad looking naked chips. As much as I dislike leaving a poor score on a restaurant, especially since my friends enjoyed their food despite their treatment prior to our arrival, I don't believe in wasting food. They were trying to over sell something and completely under delivered what was purchased.   Moral of story is if you want nachos, wait and go somewhere else. Though the top 10 chips were pretty good... Plus like 2 on the bottom... If you still go here because you're going to a game and craving nachos I'd suggest ordering the side of chips and add cheese and jalapenos and you'll get the same amount while saving significant money. Winning. Though with their service you might be lucky to get your chips.   Decent menu though so next time we're there for a game I might try one of the other dishes and see if they redeem themselves. Plus the servers can't all be like the one we had. Can they?",

I was like, excuse me I'm her mother and she will have a tea thank you! Anyways we order the ceviche here! Don't do it! They serve it on a pile of lettuce to give the impression it's a full bowl when it's only 2 Tablespoons full. And not good at all totally not worth the $15.00. Queso and chips was the only thing I think I enjoyed. The Fish taco was not good and dry the shrimp taco was same. Not a good experience or worth the $60.00 for lunch I paid. Happy Eats!",

But instead of being smart, I said hey, look that place has lots of seating available, let's duck in and wait out the Uber surge.     We ordered the nachos and they were alright.   A few burnt chips but overall everyone seemed to enjoy them.     I'm no stranger to expensive cocktails....but $11 margaritas served in plastic cups?  NOPE.    I AM a stranger to virgin drinks....but a virgin 1800 Reposado Prickly Pear margarita served without the 1800 Reposado is just prickly pear syrup and lime juice....except they refused to serve my daughter the drink unless we paid the full $10.50 price...and then when my thoughtful wife had the IMHO great idea for them to bring me the tequila on the side, our server refused unless we paid another $7 for a shot.     So, to be clear, 1800 Reposado is listed on the menu at $7.   The 1800 Reposado Prickly Pear marg is $10.50.  The value of the prickly pear and lime juice is, therefore, $3.50.  But if I wanted the prickly pear syrup and lime juice in a plastic cup with ice, and the 1800 on the side, the magic number became $17.50.  And the server wasn't budging, so short of escalating that nonsense in front of my family....I decided enough dwelling.   Also, my wife asked for lemon wedges to go with her water.   Server brought a little cup of them out after 15 minutes or so, and one of them had been squeezed already.  Bleh.",

Food was descent especially the nachos (not half price), had mini chimichanga (4 for $6.5) Arribas are better and you get more, chips n salsa and than had drinks. Seems if you get the long list of what your waiter tells you about than drinks are priced alright. We had Jay she was good at the beginning but came around less frequently later during our stay. . ***Check for prices on shots: $9.00 for a lemon drop and remember to state only the rounds you were to pay for*** all 20 were on my tab. I have never paid $9 for a shot maybe $5. So won't be doing shots there again.  Music wasn't too loud, started to pick up towards 8:30 but not what I was thinking it would be for a Friday night.",

I ordered a BUILD A BOWL, same idea as chipotle. I had it with chicken. It ran about $12 for the bowl and they totally skimped out of the lettuce and the rice was a little mushy. The flavor was ok, probably wouldn't order it again. My boyfriend ordered the carne asada tacos and he said they were ok. The food definitely tasted as if it was pre cooked too far in advance, it was literally served to us 5 mins after ordering. Probably wouldn't go back to eat. (The waitress was also a little moody and it showed)",

    "text": "Thought we would experience the local Mexican dining this afternoon while visiting Arizona.  We were immediately put off walking in the door by several people at a table having loud horns that they were continuously blowing.  It sounded like a group of whales dropping their mating calls..  There was also a live DJ playing music quite loudly that it was like being in a club at 2pm which is comical at best.  After debating for a short time of whether to just leave we decided to give the place a chance.  Due to the soccer game that would be taking place in the evening we continuously had people approaching our table peddling off Modelo brand items constantly.    We ordered a half order of nachos for the appetizer, the chili verde burrito, chicken breast entree and carne asada enchiladas.  The nachos showed up and they were huge, overall they were pretty good.  However the waitress told us our food was coming right out while placing the nachos on our table so there are some timing issues to be worked out.  The individual with the enchiladas said they were pretty good minus the steak being thrown on top instead of actually being inside the enchiladas themselves.  The chili verde burrito I ordered turned out to be a large white rice burrito with a little bit of meat and chili verde sauce, and lastly the chicken breast entree was pointed out to be the same thin pre-cooked chicken breasts we had picked up in the frozen section at the grocery store for some quick meals at work.  Overall I'd say the food was mediocre at best, the constant barrage of people approaching the table including the waitress not being attentive to a group of three this place was pretty much a bust.  The final hit for the place that was surprising was automatic gratuity for a group of three people!    I recommend trying another Mexican restaurant before wasting your money here unless you're going for the music/loud environment.",

However, that was as good as it got. The margaritas were brought without salt even though we both requested salted rims, so they needed to be repoured. The waiter was too busy to pay us much attention, but when he was there, he was knowledgeable about the menu. The food was good, I ordered the shrimp tacos, which were sweet (unexpected, but good), and barbacoas, which was quite spicy. The waiter disappeared for a while and when he returned with our checks, they were wrong and had to be redone... twice. The bathroom was not clean, one stall out of order. Really no reason for me to go back, even if I lived locally.",

I've had homemade tamales and these were unbelievable.  Perfectly cooked with the masa not the highlight but just a perfect partner to the meat.  Honestly surprised at how good this was. Restaurant tamales aren't usually this good.  A shitty beerfest was rescued by a fantastic evening here.  Thanks!",

For my entree I had the enchiladas with chicken adobo(seasoned perfectly) and I added shrimp. I opted to go with the green sauce (which was a bit too full of lime for me). Nevertheless I ate most of it. I also used a Groupon which the manager had to redeem. He was great as well, made sure everything was great.

They seated us looking right at the fountains in the courtyard and so the ambience was exciting. However as others have mentioned, a Mexican restaurant that doesn't provide chips and salsa wouldn't be someplace I'd repeatedly go to. On a Wednesday night the place had barely 10 customers. Our waitress was training another girl. After ordering a \"Hawaiian\" drink that claimed to have silver tequila in it (which I could taste the cheapness) and was less than enjoyable. I ordered the lobster taco and was told by the waitress they don't serve that any longer. Really? Couldn't even sharpie it out on the menu? Then we ordered the stuffed tomitillos and they were beautiful but miniature and undercooked. After deciding on the the shrimp tacos for an entree my girlfriend ordered something that resembled a loaded quesodilla. Both were delicious. The bill came to 77 dollars which I thought was criminal. I'd go back but only on a special occasion.",

Should they not support the home teams?  Especially since the stadium's right next door.  This place is all about the money, not the home team spirit.  And the games were on tv with no volume, but they were playing loud music instead. I will never come here again.  Had a drink and left and ate elsewhere.",

This was the first place we arrived at. All 5 of us Late 20s early 30s showed security our IDs. Went to the bar ordered some drinks for 4 of us, paid the bill and right after i give my receipt to the bar tender I was approached by an over weight Hispanic male claiming he was security. Asked me to step a side and talk to him. He tells me that his boss informed him to ask us to leave cause we are over intoxicated. LOL I inform the man this was our first place and that one of our friends is Pregnant and is not drinking. He insisted that we have been drinking and needed to go. I asked to speak with the guy who pointed us out but he refused. We were not allowed to finish the drinks i just purchased. As we were leaving the security guard at the front says \"Leaving so soon?\" I told him we were getting kicked out for being too white, rich and for being sober. He laughed and said \"oh that's common here\"!  WOW! Reasons I don't go to the west side for anything but football. This place is a joke and I cant wait to see the the next place that comes in and takes over this failed establishment.",

Great, except the greeter failed to tell a server that this new area had people seated. Finally after another 10 minutes, we asked the greeter, she had to find a server to work this area. The server moved over and got our drink orders and we did not see her for 5 minutes, So, we left, no one really seemed to care about customers in the front. With all the competition at Westgate, you would think they would try harder. But, first and last time for us. Waited 25 minutes and still never had a drink.",

I have a serious dairy allergy and he was not even familiar with dairy allergies.  After talking to him 3 times telling him exactly what to do, which should have been a sign for me to leave, I ordered my food.  I believe he used his best efforts.  The food tasted good but there was no guacamole on the carne asada guacamole tacos lol... The portions were real small and I left hungry.  Unfortunately they also did not follow my instructions as I ended up have a bad reaction to the food.   The waiter did his best but who knows what the cook did.  They need to be aware of food allergies they are actually very common.  Luckily mine is not life threatening but someone else could be.  I will not be back.",

Salt was able to sit my party of eight within 20 min and we received great service. They told us going in that food was taking about 30 minutes from when you order it so I enjoyed their honestly. Drinks kept flowing and our server checked back often. It's a very energetic atmosphere with two levels so don't come here if you don't like the noise or the crowds! My table ordered the guac, salsa and cheese dip as an appetizer that came out first with tri colored chips. My bf and I split the carne asada nachos (SO MUCH FOOD) and could barely finish- I recommend like 4 people to finish these bad boys! Others at our table ate the chicken quesadilla or carne burritos and said everything was amazing. I'd definitely come back! I noticed a few reserved tables, even on a game day, so it might be worth looking into...",

We waited for 15 minutes and no one ever came. Either there's not enough staff for a restaurant this size or they just don't know how to handle actually being busy.

My family and I said \"no\" because it was 90 degrees out and we were still adjusting to the heat. After saying so the hostess rolled her eyes and sat us at a table. From there our waitress/bartender Cara came to the table. She recommended the margaritas and various appetizers. My family and I were not very hungry so we ordered the ceviche and drinks. Let's just say the ceviche was not very good. It was fresh but lacked acidity and spice. After we ate the ceviche our waitress told us about the late happy hour. She said she would give us a happy hour menu but failed to show up again. We left minutes later. On top of that, there was a gentlemen working in the bathroom handing out soap and asking for tips. This was NOT a five star restaurant people.  Cara was friendly but very inattentive. I would give Salt a 1 star but there was plenty of T&A and sports on TV to keep you entertained. In saying so I give Salt 2 stars. Lots of eye candy, bad wait staff, loud music (terrible DJ), below average food, creeper working the bathroom, and high prices. Total tourist trap.",

I'm giving them 2 additional stars. 1 star for trying even though it was only because of my yelp review....and the waitress seemed apologetic. The second star is for taking around 80$ off our bill.  I plan to move to this area from California, so I'd  consider giving this place another chance.   OLD REVIEW: Paid for V.I.P for the night and not once did we get any extra drinks we asked for (we would have paid extra for them), but was told once our bottle is gone they were going to make us get up so they can resale the booth?  Seriously? Our waitress was nice but slow to come back after asking for multiple drinks from 3 different people.    Birthday girl goes to the bartender to let her know what happens and she calls for security saying bday girl gave attitude? So they kick the bday girl out for explaining what happened.   Bday girl did get to come back in but not after being  blamed for some unknown person throwing up in our booth? Although it wasn't anyone in our party and our waitress confirmed it with security.   This place is hella weird. I'm not from out here but they ruined my sis in law Bday, she cried because she was genuinely trying to have fun and they made her sit outside for 30 min wondering if she could rerurn to our shit V.I.P table. ...over explaining our situation about our lack of service.  As I write this we got a drink finally. Lol. The waitress actually felt bad for us and how we were treated. I thank her, but the bouncer was rude and spoke to us in a disrespectful tone.",

Their happy hour is 3-7pm and a pretty good deal with half off selected appetizers (which is most of them) and some money off of alcoholic drinks (including margaritas and sangria.) Service was good. Many vegetarian options available without the price of a meat entree!  For an appetizer we got the loaded fries which was a lot of food! Definitely order for 3-5 people not 2 people unless it's your meal. For an entree I got the enchilada with red sauce which came with a side of rice and refried beans.",

I went to the bathroom and came out to a man (security) waiting for me. He told me to follow him. He led me outside and told me I was done for the night. I was very confused because he didn't tell me who he was, why I needed to leave or what I had done? So I simply walked to the bench right out front and sat. I had no way of getting ahold of my friends because they couldn't hear their phones over the music, and he wouldn't let me tell them where I had gone. I know I was buzzed but definitely no reason to throw me out. I was scared someone could easily try and kidnap me. I wish someone would explain to me what I did and at least let me tell my group what was happening. I will never let myself be put in this position again. Don't go to Salt!",

In any event, Salt Tacos certainly didn't live up to even my low expectations.   My mood was first soured when I had to pay a cover that was almost as expensive as the parking itself. The bar is huge, but woefully understaffed. The one positive is that you can get a great giant mug of beer... but it certainly isn't a deal to do so. But the biggest sin is that we live in Arizona - arguably the US capital for great Mexican food - and everything here tasted so bland. It wasn't bad, but it just had no taste (and probably maintained all of the carbs/fat/calories). The portions were generous, but you can find big portions and high quality all over the State. I'd definitely go anywhere else than here.",

Loved the menu choices (& I'm not a fan of Mexican). Wish I didn't have to drive right away so I could've tried their margaritas. Next time.

We had a Groupon that was getting ready to expire and unfortunately they will not accept them when there is a hockey game going on and that seems to be the only time we are ever at Westgate. We sat on the patio and the weather was great. It was fun to people watch while waiting for our food. We started off with an appetizer of Ceviche. It was very tasty although it seemed to be a little light on the actual shrimp with the veggies and the broth composing most of it. I did love the half of avocado that was served atop of it - much better than dicing it into chunks inside of it like a lot of places do. I ordered the Grilled Chicken Breast with Grilled Pineapple and Onions. It came with a side of black beans and rice. I requested to substitute grilled vegetables for the rice and they happily obliged. The chicken breast was very tender and had a fantastic flavor. The grilled vegetables had some sort of sauce or marinade on them that appeared very oily and totally negated the reason I had requested them over the rice (a healthier option) and I was saddened  that I couldn't eat them. Hubby had the Chicken Enchiladas and he said they were good. The timing of receiving our entrees could have been better as we received them not long after our appetizer so we didn't even have time to finish our appetizer. Our server was nice and no complaints in that department.",

Almost every other Mexican food place has free tortilla chip with their meals. The rest of the food is pretty mediocre. If you are able to drive a little bit and leave West Gate go to Santisima -- all the chips that you want plus many different flavors of salsa, with superior Mexican food and margaritas.",

    "text": "If I could give a zero star I would.  My parents and my kiddos went to westgate to see the dinosaurs.  We chose salt, I had been before and never had a bad time or had food. Our waiter Cody L ,was the main issue.  First of all we asked if he could remember our order being that ge didn't write it down he said yes.  Rule number one... there's no shame in writing things down thi ensue you get it right.  He brought a cheeseburger without cheese and with all the dressings for my kid who is plain and likes cheese and meat (I specified that). He forgot onions on my mom's carne tacos and forgot pico... when the menue states it has those things.  Had to ask for salsa twice and get up and ask someone else for refills from another (very sweet girl)  I ordered the kids tacos, being that I ordered my son an adult burger since there was no kids burger.  My kids meal tacos were 7 bucks and my mom's was 15.... same amount of tacos and meat and rice.  When we politely asked what the big difference in price was,he said well the adults has onion on it and a side of beans.  I said \"we pay 8 dollars for beans and onion? He then rudely stated we don't typically allow adults to order from kids menu at all....  (as if I lucked out) there is no age restrictions on menu that i noticed and he didn't mention that when i ordered.   Meanwhile, I had 2 kids with me,  one didn't eat and the other had a FULL adult burger meal.   I said who cares who is eating what!... we ordered appropriately to who was there.  He was just plain rude and disrespectful and didn't need too add the snide comments.   I decided not to leave a tip which I never do because I live on tips too...but i have been in customer service, my whole working life and how we were treated for 65 dollar bill and horrible service, with a side of rude comments... he honestly just didn't deserve any kind of tip and is lucky we didn't involve managers. I'm never one to complain but Cody L. Needs some lessons on being a server and customer service or needs to get out of the business,  because Salt will lose customers with this type of behavior.  We didn't have to eat there.... and next time will opt out of it all because of one bad employee.  I hope the manager reads this and fixes this behavior on their staff! I chose this so we could see fountains and dinosaurs and sit outdoors but the experience just was not worth the displeasure.  Hopefully no one else has this happen.  Thanks to whomever reads this and I just hope it gets addressed.",

    "text": "Live every day like it's Taco Tuesday.  I've been wanting to stop into Salt for a while and I finally got a chance to for Taco Tuesday.  $1-$3 for tacos?  Why the heck not!  We started off with the Traditional Ceviche [$14 - Cured Shrimp, fresh citrus, seasoned tomato juice, pico de gallo, fresh cucumber, and avocado.  Served with house fried chips.]  I also ended up ordering three different kinds of tacos:  Potato Taco [$1 - Potato with lettuce, cheese, and lime sour cream], Carnitas Taco [$2 - Topped with habanero pineapple salsa], and a Chipotle Shrimp Taco [$3 - Shrimp topped with lettuce and drizzled with coconut cream and lime].    The Traditional Ceviche is pretty straight forward.  I personally wouldn't order this since it's something easily made at home but my friend never had it and wanted to try it out.  It was a pretty decent ceviche that was definitely more heavy on the tomato juice.  I personally like my ceviche more chunky than soupy but it's just a preference thing and was still enjoyable.  The tacos were also pretty good.  I enjoyed two out of three of them.  The one I didn't enjoy was the Chipotle Shrimp.  I was expecting more of a San Diego style shrimp taco where it would be breaded and fried.  Totally not the case here.  It was also really sweet.  Unless we're talking about Choco Tacos, I don't prefer my tacos sweet.  The Carnitas and Potato Tacos were bomb though.  I actually ended up ordering another potato taco later on.  My friend said his Carne Asada tacos were pretty good as well.  I'm not a heavy eater but I must admit that four tacos and an appetizer didn't fill me up.  Since we came around 9PM on a Tuesday, they eventually dimmed the lights on us and started blasting the music.  There was a DJ, lots of people drinking, but nobody dancing.  I could have done without the seizure-inducing strobe lights and wish I sat outside because it ended up being a bit loud.  Now we know.  Now you know too.",

I have been coming to this establishment for many years now and this is the first time ive had to deal with a sexist security guard...I did speak with Hugo the manager on duty but NO ONE wanted to give me the security guards name (all I asked for was a first name) to explain to the manager on duty which was Hugo what had occurred. I as a patron (I work in the medical Field) Observed i'm Nother customer very intoxicated throwing up at a booth she was unable to stand...A black gentlemen who was a security guard approached the young lady and started to escort her out but he turned around and came back towards the DJ booth which was passing right by myself and a male friend I had with me. I proceeded to ask be security guard if she was OK to walk out of the establishment because Observing her at that point she was exhibiting signs of alcohol poisoning as two gentlemen were literally carrying her out of the bar. The security guard which I do not know his name because no one would give it to me... Told me to mind my own business and I said well screw you she obviously was very intoxicated. He then turned to my male friend and it said is this your woman? You need to control her. Which then my response was what is your name I would like to speak to a manager. I was then escorted to the front of the bar by another security and told I was able to speak to the manager which was Hugo. I am not satisfied that I was able to get the name of the security that evening that displayed such sexist behavior...Which I think it was relevant to any type of review I would have for this establishment also to hopefully further discuss this situation with the owner. I feel as an establishment that I come to very frequently... I have been extremely disrespected by a sexist male security.",

When the drinks did finally come, they forgot the coke, which should have been the easiest. The soup was cold and we had to send it back as well. My only conclusion is that they must get so much business from the games that they really don't care about service.

The food was great and the service remained excellent thought our dinner. The only thing that wasn't amazing was the sides that came with the burrito which were refried beans and Spanish rice. They were obviously packaged and lacked flavor. But this place still deserves a great rating because everything else was outstanding, especially the service!",

The food was also really quick and drinks were cold. Staff was really friendly.  Their house margarita could use some work, only thing I wouldn't recommend.",

We ordered our drinks which were good. We then ordered our appetizer and entrees. We ordered ceviche as our appetizer so it should have come quickly. Instead, my wifes entree came and they asked if there would be anything else. After explaining what we didn't get, the man walked away looking confused. A few minutes later the server came and said they were just waiting on shells for my tacos. Nothing was said about the app, so I told him to just cancel it. Server was very standoffish after that, never apologized or anything for the inconvenience. Mistakes happen and Im a great tipper, but I left nothing. An apology would have went a long way! We wont be back.",

    "text": "Discriminating and Falsely accusing your customers of being something they are not is not a good way of doing business. My brother and I came in from out of town for Sunday Night Football at the nearby stadium. Fellow fans told us to come to this place for some post game drinking and fun. Apparently according to the bouncer, we were already drinking and did not allow us in because we were \"too intoxicated\". The problem is, that we hadn't drank alcohol at all yet. The only thing we had that whole day and at the game was overpriced soda and water. We were completely shocked and insulted so we asked to speak with a manager. We tried to plead our case and told him we were sober. Of course we were visibly upset and angry and the manager used that to justify that we were in fact intoxicated. \"Your being aggressive\" he said,\"Which shows me that you have been drinking too much\".  Seriously? Then out of nowhere he lies and says \" See, you just said you were drinking\".  Like where did that even come from?  A part of me thought, Does this guy just not like Mexicans since there we not many that I seen. I hate when people play the race card but that is just something that went though my mind at the time. Just an awful feeling period. Taking legal action is not even worth it and know there is probably not even a case as it is there right as a business to refuse service to whoever they want. That's fine, but they are not going to get away without at least a yelp review. Fortunately there were other bars there and we got in with no problems. 0 Stars!",

My first drink a tequila sunrise was so sweet you could not tell if the tequila was even in the drink.  I ordered a soda and the first one was flat they said they had to change tanks, they brought me another soda and it was still flat.  At least they didn't charge me for the soda.  My friend had some coffee and said that it was a good cup.  Should have gone with the coffee. How this place will stay open until football season I don't know if service and food doesn't improve.",

Upon our entrance the host which also turned out to be the manager was pretty rude to us as she sat us down. As we looked at the menu, and we asked about the specific drinks the host / manager / server told us \"just look at the menu\". At that point I decided to find the manager, and when the server told us it was her I asked if we could get a different server. The new server came up and it was the same overall poor attitude, we are heading out from we decided to get out of there. On the menu however, the prices of the drinks were absolutely exorbitant and there was not that much choice in regards to different food items available. For that reason we will never go back and will let everyone else know that there are other choices that would be much better than this restaurant",
