The huge side of roasted beets for $5 was also great.  The carrots - not so much...bland, etc.  Only 1 bathroom downtstairs.  Bathrooms upstairs are bigger and pretty cool.  Both upstairs & downstairs bars are cool, more intimate downstairs.  The menu is really pretty pricey.  Same menu as Richardson's/Dick's Hideaway, and they serve both menus at Rokerij, which a lot of people don't realize.",

There are only 3 tables for dining downstairs and there was a wait, which is fine.  We noshed on the stuffed  mushrooms and bacon wrapped shrimp while lounging on the sofa near the fireplace.  They had ESPN on and the Tour recaps were looping, music playing at a nice level and it wasn't crowded at all.  We had a New Zealand Sauvignon Blanc, perfect with the apps.  Great experience overall - I will return!",

My Sis had the meatloaf with eggs, I had the rellenos with eggs (one beef one cheese) and we ordered Carne Adovado to take home to her Hubby.  We REALLY ENJOYED our meals.  My beef relleno was so amazing and the cheese was just as good.  I loved the smokey flavor, especially the carne adovado.

The staff, both upstairs and downstairs, is incredibly friendly and helpful.  The wine list is amazzzzzing. So many yummy wines to choose from! Start with a glass of wine, then choose a couple of appetizers like the Brie Toasts or the stuffed mushrooms. Then, as a main course, go with the Garlic Plate or the Gumbo. Sooo good. Or the Porterhouse, or the Sea Bass, or the Pasta Heidi.. Can't go wrong with any of those. Even their House Salad is amazing.   After dinner, enjoy some berries and gelato. Not too fattening but absolutely delicious!",

I was obsessed with their wine, service, bread, green chile potatoes, red meat (when I still ate it) and their fish specials. Every time we've had special guests in town, we've taken them here. Due to having a child , getting healthier and busier, it's been months since our visit. It was hot, sweaty, and we totally ignored.  After ordering entrees and  several bottles, we saw our food eons later.  There was no bread as well. And the more I thought about it, our old waiter was much better, yet he NEVER remembered us. Even though we came in regularly (weekly) and were very generous. So mabeye I shouldn't be surprised. I guess I wanted to like this place more than it deserved :(",

I love New Mexican (as in the state) food and understand the addition of broader American and Mexican options in the menu... but found myself wishing they had stuck with a single theme, and done it well.  The sauces (for enchilada, chile relleno) were wonderfully flavored.  I was not impressed with the ceviche (probably because I was not anticipating a tomato based marinade).  Wine list was good.    It's an accessible menu.  I think I was hoping for more niche-cuisine.",

    "text": "My fiance took his pediatric boards yesterday and that calls for a no-more-studying-at-coffee-shops-during-dinner celebration! We are brand new to Phoenix and these last few months have been eating lots of Mexican and some more Mexican, which we are not complaining about in the least, but it was time for something different. Our neighbor recommended Richardson's/Rokerij as his favorite so I made a reservation for Monday night.  We sat in their downstairs dining room tucked in a generous booth in the back corner. My fiance ordered a Dark and Stormy and we split a bottle of Pinot Noir as our server informed us of their 1/2 price bottles of wine deal. Hurrah! We ordered 2 appetizers: the bacon-wrapped scallops and the crab-stuffed mushrooms. One bite of the scallops and we were in heaven. They were GIANT, perfectly cooked, and beautifully placed in a pool of amazingly different dipping sauces. You can never go wrong with wrapping bacon on a piece of, well, anything, but this appetizer was magical.  My fiance ordered the Rokerij Steak with roasted corn and mashed sweet potatoes in a chili pepper. I'm not a steak lover, but took one bite of his dish and it melted in my mouth. Fantastic. I ordered the Swordfish special with roasted eggplant and mashed sweet potatoes in the chili pepper as well, and I devoured every bite!   What did it for me, however, was the dessert. We shared the truffle with vanilla gelato topped with berries. The truffles were like buttery brownies in a hard shell and perfectly portioned to satisfy. Very memorable. We will be back, even if it's just for the truffles!",

So one weekday my girl and I met up for happy hour here and we both fell in love with the ambiance as soon as we entered. We came in the wrong door downstairs, and were a little confused as to where to go lol bar in the basement was full so we were directed up the staircase. The bar there was also full but lucky for us a couple decided to head down to the basement and free'd up the seats for us :) (bet they thought we came up from down there and emptied our seats at that bar .. suckers) .  We sat down and it took a little while before we were helped, but the way we talk it didn't matter. We each ordered our drinks, prickly pear margaritas, which were absolutely delicious. Made with fresh squeezed lemon. We decided to order a few appetizers. Chile Relleno made with pork (even though I wanted duck), Ceviche and the  Beef Tenderloin toasts.  The chile relleno and toasts were to die for! The pork inside the relleno was smoky and tender and flavorful. So darn good! As were the toasts. I could have eaten two orders all by myself. The meat was so tender and tore apart with the toast without tugging. The cheese was creamy and just the right amount topping off a buttery toast. YUM!!  The ceviche was good, but nothing out of the ordinary. I will for sure order the toasts again and try the garlic plate. A couple next to us ordered it and it looked delicious.   The staff and chef there were very nice and took great care of us! I canNOT wait to go back. I have been craving it since I left.  Definitely need to make a dinner date out of it too as the eggs benedict looked so darn good! I want to try one of everything!.   LOVE YOU ROKERIJ!!!",

And they were very accommodating for us. They offer a good selection of seafood, steak and  if you are looking for smaller, try the small plates. You can get one, two or even three for a reasonable price. I had seared ah-tuna and mushroom-brie mini bruschetta toasts for my small plates and they were perfect! They also have great salads. They place is usually crowded and especially on a holiday evening even more so and noisy so if you are looking for quietness, not here! But if you are like me and enjoy the patrons as a part of the dining establishment, shouldn`t bother you! I get a kick out of people watching as well.

It is cozy, intimate and sexy. You're at the top of your game if you bring a date here-you will wow them and they'll think you're the bomb (if they haven't been here). It's also a great place to just chill with a small group of friends.  You nostrils will be tempted with the smell of a cozy fire and mouthwatering dishes before you even get throught the door. The upstairs dining room surrounds an open kitchen. Low lighting and a roraring fire-HELLO...need I say more? I highly recommend the downstairs cellar which has a long copper-top bar, along with a few tables-there is also a little cozyy nook/booth-PERFECT place to get a little romance on. The food is outstanding-I highly recommend the 3-plate/$25 offering. The portions are generous-plenty for two people to share. The bartenders downstairs are AWESOME and are always ready to make an enthusiastic recommendation if you can't decide. The music played downstairs is awesome too. EVERYTHING about this place is a awesome. My first night here was nothing short of PERFECT!!!!",

The catch: you have to be sitting at the bar. Not in the booths next to the bar, but at the bar. Each couple ordered 4 small plates and then we all shared. Pretty much everything I tasted, I liked. The brie toasts were by far my favorite...I could have ate the whole plate myself.  The bacon wrapped scallops were really good as well; the calamari was delicious especially because the breading wasn't very heavy and it was quite tasty as well (we consider ourselves calamari snobs). The crab tostadas were good but I don't enjoy cold crabmeat too much.  My husband tried the shrimp scampi and he liked it, but said that if hadn't come with the rice, it would have been bland. He said the rice added flavor to the dish.  With the small plates, it seems that most of the plates come with six of that particular item.   Drink prices were really good...for 8 small plates and 9-10 drinks between the four of us, our bill came to $84. I was shocked when the bill came because it was so cheap, considering all we ate and drank.  The decor in the downstairs bar area is really cool...it's very dim and dark, but it is really cozy. There was a real fire in the fireplace which gave it a log cabin type of feel.  I will definitely be back.",

I ordered scrambled eggs with ham and toast.  what I got was a boring, flat \"plain\" omelet, some kind of plain dry dark bread (it's the only kind they offer)  oh, also, there are no straws for your drinks, they just don't ever have any.

I heard about this place but never really believed the food was this delicious.  We ordered  and shared best of two worlds: the porterhouse steak with mashed potatoes and roasted eggplant and the swordfish with the green chile sweet potato and broccolini.  With Sunday night's half off bottle of wine, this is a great Sunday dinner place.  Rokerij, you will forever be in my heart as one of the best dinner restaurants in central phoenix.",

Sea bass smothered in a sweet and sour sauce with chiles, not very fresh and overcooked --uggh.  However, I did croon over my neighbor's beef dish. The crab mini-tosadas are really good. And the vegetable side dishes-all of them, including brocolini, brussel sprouts, potato in a pot, and asparagus--are commendable.  Great atmosphere!! Have fun.",

Pick a rainy night when nothing sounds better then cozy-ing up to the fire, listening to great tunes and sipping a fabulous blueberry lemon drop or sophisticated glass of wine and there is no better place to be in Phoenix.  So unique from the big flashy restaurants smattered up and down Scottsdale.  You can dine upstairs, or downstairs at the bar in a bit more casual environment.  I have to admit that I have yet to eat upstairs.  Downstairs, you can get the same menu + and easily fill up on very substantial light fare at a reasonable price.  Try the beef tenderloin toasts and you will come back again and again.  Everyone is so friendly here, from bartenders to patrons.  If only there were more places in phoenix like this! Our own little piece of Aspen - go, go, go.",

We were starving and conveyed this to our server who kept saying \"take your timeeeee, no rush.\" Ha, no really. We would have loved it rushed. We were HUNGRY! We decided to try the quesadilla du jour after our server told us it was shredded pork in their special sauce. Instead, he brought us the oyster du jour. He said he thought we ordered the oysters. My boyfriend hates seafood and we had just had a lengthy discussion with the server regarding what the quesadilla of the day was. Huh, how did he get that wrong?! He kept running away as we were trying to give him our dinner order. It was just such a long process! My boyfriend ordered the sirloin steak medium rare and I ordered the green chili burger. His steak tasted like hamburger meat and my fries were cold. My burger was good though and I did enjoy the ambiance of sitting near the fireplace in a cozy booth, so thumbs up for that! We waited for our check. And waited. And waited. We put our credit card ON the table near the edge. And waited. Finally, our server brought it over. Our meal took over 2 hours for the two of us. I was falling asleep near the end as we tried to get the check. Between the service and the food, I don't think I'll give this place another shot.",

Comfy booths that make you want to linger over dinner for hours.  I guess the story is that it is supposed to resemble the smokehouses of the Netherlands?  I can't comment about that because I have never been to the Netherlands, but I love the vibe here.   Upscale.  American/New American food.  Meat intensive, so don't bring your vegetarian date here.  Don't over-order, the portions are quite big.  That's it.  Go.",

    "text": "So the funny thing about good restaurants is that you almost don't want to tell anyone about them and make it so you have to wait to get in.  That is how I pretty much feel about Rokerij.  I made the mistake of telling my soon to be ex husband about it (prior D day) and now I have to worry about him showing up with HIS gf and I am there with.... someone.  Sooo.. that being said, I really like this restaurant.  Can I tell you tho that I ONLY go downstairs to eat.  Waaay cooler.  Stairs are a little tricky down... kinda thinkin that they are not up to code and an accident waiting to happen...maybe I could get a free meal?  Hmm.. ok, back to the restaurant.  The downstairs bar is a funky copper and there are 2 seats in front of the big fireplace (I never get the chance to sit there darn it) and all the seating in the restaurant (upstairs and down)is booth.  Love that.  Much more cozy.   Their wine selection is pretty good.  I pretty much have the Klinker Brick red all the time.  My fave dish there is their cornflake crusted halibut w/ salsa.  Deelish!  And their corn side is amazing.. roasted corn and the main man and I were stabbing each other over it.  He always has the mashed potatoes as a side and they come in this little kettle that is super hot. Just warnin you.  I am not much of a potato person but he says that they are good so I will have to take his word.  I even like their house salad.. has chunks of bleu cheese and if I remember right, cranberries.  Btw, Rokerij, you used to have spiced pecans in the salad too but they are gone.  I have a very sad face right now .   Sooo.. that's what I think.. the Rokerij is  a great date place (but only plan on bringing someone you are really into otherwise later when you break up you may have an embarrassing encounter there) and perfect for the holidays!",

Really, I said. Ok, then.  Ok, when I can get a decent bottle of Veuve Cliquot at Safeway for crying out loud for under $50... ?? where am I? oh, right. North of Camelback.  And it's freezing in there, now that it's in the low 60s at night outside, does it really need to be ultra-air conditioned inside? But...I did enjoy the Ferrari Carano, Siena Meritage 06 very much and as usual the beef tenderloin with French brie on toasts was delish! And the veal meatballs rival Lisa g's meatballs not in size but certainly in taste and flavor. My husband had the pasta dish on special, flat ribbon pasta with a cream chipotle sauce, bacon wrapped shrimp...mmh, it was good, but not fantastic.  The service, when you do get it, IS good, I think they were short-handed though - our waiter was also the solo bartender... oh, and another plus Chimay on tap.  p.s....how could I forget!?  THE best caesar salad EVER. I'd go back just for that.",

All plates came with homemade fresh beans. My husband had the Cheese Relleno  and I had the Advodaca, they were fabulous!

The Rokerij is actually our favorite Sunday brunch. We come almost every week and sit at the bar top, where Brittany always takes such great care for her patrons. Her bar back is one of the best in town, always keeping glasses of water full and any odds and ends delivered with our meal.  We have had just about everything on the brunch menu. The breakfast burrito is the best bang for your buck, especially with their delectable red sauce and chorizo.   The carne adovada is fabulous. Enjoy it with a side of eggs, or as an egg Benedict dish. Wonderful!!   Of course, their special Dutch pancake is out of this world. So sweet, but with a bit of a crunch on the outside and a fluffy center and served with warmed syrup. If you are ever presented with the opportunity, be sure to order the peppered bacon for an extra special treat with any dish!!",

My in-laws were visiting and we decided to take them last night. We had a great table next to the fireplace. Food was delicious as usual. The service was absolutely awful. The waitress acted like we were inconveniencing her by being there. She hardly came over to check on us. The other staffers were eager to help fill our glasses and get us to go boxes, but the waitress never checked to see if our food was good or we needed anything. She even spoke like she didn't give a shit. I was so eager to share this place with our family and it backfired. We had to apologize for a birthday dinner spoiled by the attitude of a crappy waitress. I won't lie and say I'll never be back, but it definitely won't be on the top of my list for a nice night out. The 3 stars is for the food and all other staff. The waitress gets zero stars.",

And these are two of my favorite things *queue music*  The basement bar area was so crisp and cool on at 120+ degree day in Phoenix. The bartender greeted us as we entered and urged us to sit where we wanted. It was dim but reminded me of pubs in Ireland. We picked a cushy, big booth and got comfortable. The menu was different, all day brunch for example, and your typical Mexican fare.   Ordered a salad and a cheese enchilada, all entree plates come on a tortilla. Food was not as good as I had hoped it would be, but the atmosphere made up for it.",

Hence why I wanted to spend a special night there. I'm not a picky diner but when paying a hefty price I definitely anticipate at least the fundamentals of good service. I felt like we were judged because we were a young couple. Our server didn't offer the specials, yet offered them to the table right next to us. Which is disappointing because I typically always go for a special.. I would have asked but didn't know they were offering one until it was offered to the table next to us. My bf's beer came flat. The filet was mediocre at best and the highest price I've paid compared to Fleming's and The House Brasserie(great places for a filet). My double butter mashed potatoes were so starchy and bland definitely not double butter in my opinion. And our server never came to ask how our food was.  I think things have gone down hill a bit since my previous experiences. I'd like to say I'd be back again but not so sure. Maybe for happy hour.",

There were at least 4 open tables, the larger tables, but still they were open. The bartender and then the hostess were only willing to seat us at the bar since we were a party of two. We were looking for a sit down lunch in which we planned to eat and enjoy several drinks.  We walked out after realizing the staff had no desire to accommodate us or concern for losing a customer. We decided to go down to the Rokerij to see if the attitude was different there. It was complete empty yet all the tables said reserved.  We asked the bartender if we could sit at a table. He had to excuse himself to go upstairs to ask permission. That was enough for us. There are too many good places to eat in Phoenix.  Oh by the way, until today we were loyal regulars to all three Richardson's restaurants.",

So for our recent date night, we thought we'd drive pass Dick's and give Rokerij a try.  The menu is similar, actually maybe a little more extensive. They have a larger selection of entrees and fish specials of the day. They have a little more than half of what Dick's offer and then some. I had a really hard time deciding because they had so many specials. I opted for the fish trio so I can have a variety of flavors. The BF didn't venture far and went for the usual Carne Adovada.   I felt all my fish with their accompanied sauces were very mild. I have had several fish dishes at Dick's and they all have been heavy seasoned and flavorful - exactly what you expect from a New Mexican restaurant. I didn't get that here. My BF's Carne Adovada was identical to Dick's so he enjoyed his meal.  I'm not sure if I would come back. I think I will stick to Dick's. It's a tiny bit closer, slightly lower cost but most importantly tastes better! I can only see myself picking Rokerij over Dick's if I'm looking for better ambiance.",

We did and found the coziest little bar room. My wife had delicious blackened scallops that came with four different sauces on the plate.  They were tender and perfectly cooked with a smokey and spicy crust. I had the bone-in prime rib with smoked beets cooked medium rare.  It was as perfect as prime rib can be.  Highly recommend this place.",

Good thing about dining downstairs is the cell phone reception is not so good. It's good for friends to hangout without staring at the phone. In general, Dick's hideaway is a better experience than Rokerij.",

    "text": "After reading several reviews on Yelp, we had to try this place. Any restaurant that has a Dutch name yet is classified as a Mexican restaurant definitely piques one's fancy. Having found a space to park in the rather small parking lot, our group headed toward the entrance. Arriving there we had a choice, straight ahead or down the stairs into the bowels of the earth. An easy decision as the stairs reminded me of an English castle I once visited. At the bottom of the stairs, the view we were offered was delightfully reminiscent of an old English pub (I'm not getting a Dutch vibe yet!). As there were no tables that did not have reserved signs on them, we decided to sit at the bar (great decision) and managed to find four seats at the end (or beginning if you have just entered the restaurant). We ordered a bottle of wine, because it was happy hour (half price), and perused the menu. As we couldn't decide which wine to order, the bar person, Nicole, gave us a couple of samples so it was much easier to decide. Everything looked tasty and what we ordered was delightful. Of the three dishes we ordered, the pecan grilled trout was the winner although nobody complained about anything, as all the plates were empty before we left and we were all stuffed. A close second were the carne adovada and the parppardelle with duck. (Nothing came third as two people ordered the carne adovada). The cauliflower and brussel sprouts were melt-in-your-mouth yummy. As we were eating, the restaurant filled up so I would recommend reservations as the eating area is not very large. Overall, this was a great meal and this place ranks highly on my places where I need to eat again (and again). As we left, I considered whether this was really a Dutch restaurant and I have to conclude that it is because the Dutch really know how to make food taste great.",

Mimosas are cheap and I like that they don't use cheap champagne to make them but watch out for the Bloody Mary's they're spicy! I prefer to eat in the basement where it's dark. Perfect if you're nursing a hangover! Just don't plan on doing anything after because you will be in a serious food coma!",

We got here before 230pm and I am writing my review at 430pm I just walked out. I wouldn't come back here because the food isn't that great to wait that long.

I had dinner on New Years Eve with reservations and let me tell you ... the service was terrible and the restaurant was not busy at all, our server forgot to mention about a certain food being in one of their specials which should not happen as someone in the party had a food allergy. When the food came out, it came out at different times and a couple of us at the table had to wait while our food got cold waiting for the others' food to come out. I ordered a glass of Cabernet and IT CAME OUT COLD.. when I asked why, they told me the owner likes to chill his red wines so they chill them......WHAT. Our food took an hour to come out. When it came out, the asparagus was undercooked on 2 of 3 plates.. for 3 at dinner it came to $200 and when I asked to speak to a manager... he sent the waitress back in to speak with us and refused to speak to us.. overall, fucking pathetic meal and restaurant.",

    "text": "My husband and I have been wanting to try this place for a while so today on our way home from Scottsdale we stopped in around 330-4ish for a late lunch/early dinner.  The forced valet parking is definitely a con.  This is especially True because they were not even remotely busy at this time.  Our second turn off was that all of the tables around the bar area downstairs were marked reserved.  We were told by the bartender that we could not sit there because of it and had to sit at the bar instead.  The entire time we were there not one person came in to sit down at the reserved tables.  I have dined out all over the place in many different cities and many types of restaurants and this was a first.  I understand that people make reservations and restaurants choose to accept them.  However, I have never seen it where all of the tables are reserved for the entire night and staff refuses to let you sit at one of the many empty tables.  I'm sure this place does get busy later on on Saturday night, but we were long gone by then.  As far as food goes, the crab stuffed mushrooms were good, but cold.  The mako shark and brussel sprouts were tasty.  However, the quality of the food did not match the prices in my opinion.  The bar area is in a basement that is encased by stone walls so the atmosphere is cozy cool.  Overall this place is worth trying, but it probably won't blow your mind.",

Went there once again the other day and sat at the bar as it was still early enough to get a seat.  Waited about 10 minutes for someone to take our drink order - not a huge deal as we were there to relax and in no hurry - but at Hillstone someone would have taken our drink order in 1 minute.   Could just be me, the music was too loud and too catering to a 20 something crowd.  Doesn't fit the cool vibe of the space and sounds like the bartender or dishwasher selected the music.  Ordered 3 small plates.  Calamari was cold.  Shrimp dish with toast was best and toast with mushrooms could be SO much better.  Overall, below average.  Ordered desert - chocolate torte - which was impossible to eat as it felt like it just came out of the freezer.  It needed one hour of defrost time.  To his credit, our server took that off our bill (without our asking, so good job there).  Overall, atmosphere is great.  But, that's it.",

Venture to the basement -via a gorgeous stone-framed stairwell or the semi-sketchy elevator- for a cozy cabin feel and be sure to check out their specials (on the chalkboard)!  I dined there with a group of four on a Friday night and my entree came out later than the others, so our Server ended up comping our dessert, which was both unexpected and extremely accommodating.   Get creative, because the Rokerij boasts a full bar, but no Cocktail List; or simply go for a glass of vino.  For a filling and mouth-watering entree, try the Rokerij Steak, Chimoy Chicken, or Red Chile Pasta.  Got a sweet tooth?  The Creme Brulee is guaranteed to put a smile on your face.  I pinky swear that this place is unlike any other Valley eatery...  Foodies, ASU students, and even Snobsdale peeps unite!  This is the place for you!",

We informed him it was our first visit and he went above and beyond to insure that we would become life long patrons.  I, myself was looking forward to trying the prime rib.... Unfortunately they were out(because it must be amazing) however, I ordered the pepper steak based on AJ's advice and was not disappointed one bit. Amazing!

We spent our evening downstairs in what I can only describe as \"speak-easy\" atmosphere reminiscent of my days spent in the DC area.  I loved it.  Decor was spot on with stone walls, a fire place with comfy leather chairs strategically placed in front.  A big bar took up most of the room with some comfy look booths placed around the outskirts of the room. Lots of great details in decorations and design.  Our bartender was friendly and efficient. His suggestions on wine (1/2 price bottle!) and the manhattan we had were spot on.  He checked in with us and was attentive, but not overly so, letting us enjoy each other's company.    We tried 3 of the small plates:  the roasted pepper bruschetta, tenderloin skewers and the bacon wrapped shrimp.  Honestly, I was expecting to be hungry afterwards and was ready to order something else in addition to that, but we held off until we received our food and I'm glad we did. The portions were pretty large and food rich.  Everything tasted great...the bacon and tenderloin were served on long plates that had 3 different sauces...a creamy queso (I think), a spicy red sauce and a green tomatillo-like sauce.  The red and green were really good - the white was a bit bland....but I'm also not a fan of cream sauces, so don't take my word for it.  The bruschetta was more of an italian style bruschetta (bread, peppers layered on top with melted cheese).  Tasted good, but my only complaint would be that it got a little mushy because there was so much topping on it. My date enjoyed it.  Overall, a great experience. I can't wait to go back - especially when looking for a laid back, cool atmosphere. And I definitely want to try more of the food!",

    "text": "I work near the Rokerij, so my coworker and I have gone for lunch several times. We always get the prime rib sliders and the bacon wrapped scallops. Anything wrapped in bacon is worth a try, and we thought these were very good.   Decided to try the Rokerij for dinner with some friends. We went downstairs to the basement which was very cool. It was crowded, and the servers were very nice, but it took some time to get our food.   The best part of the Rokerij is that they sell my favorite wine by the bottle. I cannot find it anywhere else in town, so that is a big plus for me.",

We had a vegetarian in our group and with mostly meat and fish dishes served we were a little worried she wouldn't find much to suit her tastes. Steven our server was great and pointed out so many options to her. She left full, satisfied and can't wait to go back for more. Others in our group had Lamb, Pork and SeaBass.  As usual it was delicious and did not dissapoint!  The servings are large so expect you may go home with a to-go box.  Wine list is great but if you prefer a cocktail they really know how to make them. We love the Rokerij and will visit the cellar again as well as Richardsons patio once this summer heat goes away. Keep up the good work Rokerij.",

    "text": "Went for the first time recently. I would give 5 stars, but as first timers, it was clear that the day we went, the bartender really catered to the regulars. And there could not have been more than 6 customers in the whole place not including us at the time. Meanwhile, us newbies sat for 5 minutes without being greeted as she looked at us and still yucked it up with her co-worker and the regulars. Not serving them. Just talking.   Once she finally greeted us, she was no longer the smiling happy person that was just talking to the regulars and coworker. Instead, she was dry, cold and unwelcoming. She went through the motions. Never smiled. And forgot part of our order.   Another table of non regulars came in and sat and they got the same dry, cold treatment we got. All this time she would bounce back to the regulars with smiles and small talk. Hoping the management is reading these reviews. There is a theme of bad attitude and bad service from the staff at Rokerij in many posts here on yelp. It really ruins the experience at your restaurant.  Thank goodness for the food. It was amazing. We had several appetizers and a couple of the benedicts. Everything was very good. My only complaint about the food was the calamari was not too warm when served but it was still good  We look forward to coming back with hopes of having a better experience from the staff.",

    "text": "We have been coming here for years so I guess it is past due for a review.  We used to go there almost every week because there was a really nice bartender that we enjoyed visiting with her but one days she was gone.  We asked what happened but the new bartenders never heard of her!  Weird.  They also changed up the parking a little making it very difficult to park unless you use the Valet which I will never use forced Valet so many times we'd drive in and then drive away.  Since most people hate forced Valet it is a mystery why anybody would use it here.  Guess they don't care that much about what their customers want.  There is an upstairs and a downstairs which is very intimate with a nice fireplace.  Most of the seating is at the bar and the bartenders are very friendly and will engage in conversation which we like.  Speaking of the bar they have a pilsner not tap from Helton Brewing Company, a local brewery which is as good as it gets!  I'm going to have to check them out!  I wish they still had Guiness because it was always good there.  They finally got Chimay there. They also have some good wine too.  The food can be hit or near miss, never bad but just OK.  The trout was alway one of my favorites until they increased the price by $8 so can't justify that anymore. None of the other entrees I tried there I can say were outstanding.   Recently we went there and walked through the upstairs and saw a bone in prime rib on the spit.  I had to try that for $36.  It is hard to find excellent prime rib around these parts but i thought how can you go wrong cooking it on a spit?  I was a little disappointed because it was just all right.   I have to say many of the entrees are just OK but the sides are very good, love the beets and brussels sprouts.  The apps tend to be better and priced right for happy hour.  I will probably just stick to the apps from now on since I feel the entrees are just too expensive for what you get.  Their pan seared salmon app is to die for though.  We get it every time except last visit when they were out.  The calamari is also very good, crispy but tender.",

After some wine we ordered the bacon wrapped jalapenos stuffed with cheese. I normally have a high tolerance for spicy heat but after a bite my wife said they were all mine. After consuming 3 very large and extremely tasty peppers I was already regretting the next day's visit to the restroom.  After those tasty treats I ordered more wine and the enchiladas with a fried egg on top with the green sauce. I loved every savory minute of it.  Looking forward to trying something different on our next visit.",

As our main entree we ordered the prime rib. This prime rib has got to be the best prime rib I've had in a long time. First of all, the cut was so big I couldn't even finish half of it.

The prime rib came out without the horseradish and she had to wait a good ten minutes for it to arrive.  By then the meat was getting cold.  I had the rack of lamb and it was pretty good.  We told the server that we were splitting this between the two of us.  There was never a second plate brought so we wiped off the plate left on the table from an appetizer and made do with that as the second plate.

Perhaps that's a me problem.  Regardless, I love this place. It has the feel of a speakeasy but serves delicious food. And there's a very cool bar downstairs which is my preference  to be seated.  We sat at the bar in the upstairs unit and had the most attentive and sweet bartender. She never faltered even though she was busy as hell. We ordered past martinis from her that were so delightful followed by an order of calamari. They had a slight peppered flavor which made them that much better.  For entrees, I ordered a special of the branzino with green chili potato and brussel sprouts which didn't disappoint. My other half ordered the pork chop (ewe. Not a fan of pork)... with mash potatoes and brocolini. He bragged of that. I so look forward to coming back. I just hope we get a spot in the mysterious downstairs basement next time!",

We have hosted many folks from all over the world and this restaurant has left a memorable impression on all of them.  In fact, several of our friends have revisited us and the first thing they ask is if we can go back to the restaurant(s).",

The meat preparation (cooked incorrectly) and quality of cuts have been sub-par for a restaurant that charges roughly $25 - $40 per main dish.    If you want to have a nice appetizer and glass of wine, this is a great place.  If you want to get a nice meat dish or southwestern cuisine I recommend spending your money at a different place unless you live nearby.  The valley is flooded with similar restaurants and you money is better spent elsewhere for a nice meal.",

It's been a while since I've eaten dinner here, but I do remember loving the green chili potato and the mashed potatoes.I also tried the flatbread with shrimp, and while I was skeptical, it was actually really good. Even my seafood-hating mom liked it.  Brunch is amazing! I've only tried the breakfast burrito with bacon and red chili because it is so delicious I can't bring myself to try anything else! I've heard from friends the enchiladas are also quiet tasty. The mimosa is pretty good and not too sweet, but it is kind of pulpy.  Happy hour is also great. Small plates are $5. Just make sure you get the blue crab tostadas- they are probably one of my favorite things I have ever eaten! The steak tartare and bacon wrapped scallops are also great choices. My mom likes the tacos, but I thought they were just alright. Sunday, Monday, and Tuesday also means 1/2 bottles of wine! How can you pass that up?  Upstairs has big booths and is quieter, but I love the cellar bar. Great music, and the fireplace is awesome. There are a few booths downstairs too. It does get crowded though, so get there early and snag yourself a seat!",

They have a great champagne pour for the mimosas so it's worth it! Today we ordered the gruyere steak sandwich with green and red chili on the side. I don't know when they changed their French fries but they were disappointing (super thick cut). Enjoyed their enchiladas which never disappoints. Our party tried one of the specials on the board \"rokerij benedict\" which included a beef tenderloin with fresh crab on top. Our friend enjoyed his meal, but said it was huge so you could definitely split. Lastly, we ordered the French toast which came on French baguettes and was very appetizing. Overall, this place always delivers. We prefer to go to their other location (dicks hideaway) because their chili seems to always be a little hotter. Complementary valet like most places around the valley which is super annoying. We had to wait 5 mins for our car that we could literally take 15 steps to get too. Wish that would go away.",

    "text": "Been here a couple of times.  And while the vibe is cool and the cuisine is pretty darn good, the glaring red flag for me about this place is the high prices.  My date had not been here before so I happily brought her by.  It had been about 9 months since my last trip here and I faintly remembered the food being on the pricey side, but not to the extent that I would shy away from here.  This place is pretty popular during happy hour as the upstairs bar was packed right as we arrived.  We suspected the same was True of their basement bar as well so we stuck around the main dining area.  If you've been to Richardson's and/or Dick's Hideaway just a stones throw away, then some of the menu will look familiar.  Rokerij however also has a lot of dishes you'd expect to find at a steakhouse or a cafe that often have no New Mexican influence at all.  Such items include oysters, rib eyes, porterhouses, and (oddly) pizzas.  The New Mexican dishes that both Rokerij and Richardson's serve are pretty reasonably priced around $15 each.  But most of the other items run around $30 and up.  Even the appetizers are around $15 a piece.  Not wanting to break the bank, I got a pair of their tapas plates.  I got their prime rib sliders as well as their Carne Adovada sliders.  For $10 a plate you get three sliders each.  I'm pretty convinced the tapas menu is the way to go here.  The portions weren't huge, but large enough to leave me satisfied and you can get a little taste of multiple items.  The Carne Adovada pork mixed with red chile is tender and not too spicy.  The prime rib sliders had just the right amount of horseradish sauce on them, though there wasn't as much meat on those sliders as I expected.  I would love to try some of their blackboard menu items sometime as some of those looked great, but again, pricey.  Perhaps I should've been more prepared to pay the asking price of this place.  The setup of the restaurant is really cool and I like the unique New Mexican twists they put on the everyday grub.  The food has been good both times I've been here, but is it good enough to drop $30/entree?  I'll leave that up to you.  I'd certainly come back here for a special occasion, but this wouldn't be an everyday stop for me.  Too much of a shock to my bank account.",

Knowing that we had never eaten at Rokerij, David took the time to explain the menu in detail and made recommendations.  Rokerij has quite the wine and beer list, however I opted for one of the specialty cocktails listed on the board. It was a double berry martini. I guess I was thinking double berry meant double the berries but it actually meant double vodka (I am a rookie, what can I say?)and was far too strong for a girl who likes her alcohol embedded in a concoction that tastes yummy. David must have seen I was struggling to drink this so he very kindly got a tall glass with ice and added some lemonade and then poured my \"vodka surprise\" on in. Yay! It was much more suitable and I was able to enjoy. :)  I ordered a sirloin steak with roasted corn and their signature potato baked into a green chile. The potato was cold but it tasted good and definitely had a kick. My friend ordered the enchiladas (one steak, one chicken, one shrimp) and loved their dish.  I would definitely go back and try out some of their other dishes, There was so much that looked and sounded good. Sitting at the bar, we could see the food being prepared and everything that came out looked delicious. The portions are very generous at Rokerij. We will be back soon!",

Their halibut is always cooked to perfection and their sweet potato (served in a hatch chile) is so good, it's almost annoying. If you've got a sweet-tooth, they've got the chocolate lovers AND the vanilla babies covered! (The creme brulee is my favorite).

    "text": "Everyone in the \"know\" in Phoenix knows about the Rokerji / Richardsons. This place serves the best southwestern food hands down. Ask Esquire magazine, who awarded them best bar in America. And of course Phoenix Mag gives their nod to this place almost every year. These 2 restaurants occupy the same real estate but the Rokerji is in the basement and it is my personal favorite. The atmosphere is 5 stars. Big sofas, large booths in a Grotto like setting with a roaring fire. It doesn't get any better than this. The menu is the same whether you choose to stay up top at Richardsons or go down below to the basement. The food is hands down the best of its kind in town. Now if you are heat sensitive, listen to your server. The owner of these places means it when he says \"spicy\" but it's oh so worth the pain. My favorite here is the Carne Adovada with an egg on top. It is unforgettable. The egg is the magic touch to me with this dish. They tend to have this more on the breakfast side but don't let that deter you. You can have them add the egg anytime. The richness of the warm yolk melding into this dish sends it over the top. Trust me you will absolutely love it. I give The Rokerji / Richardsons 5 stars in spite of some of the tired burned out staff members. Unfortunately some of the servers here have forgotten the True meaning of being in the service industry.  It is my feeling that the owner, Richardson, needs to remind his staff that there is 3 parts to a great dining experience. The ambiance, the fantastic food and the SERVER.  But for now overlook the occasional subpar server and give this place a try. It will become one of your favorite spots right after your first mouthwatering bite.",

(It's apparently a weird bar-restaurant sisterhood thing, but we tried the dishes mentioned in the mag, so we were definitely at the right place).  To start, we got the roasted garlic plate, which was massive. Could easily feed 2-3 people. The server explained the dish as he broke down the elephant garlic, then we got to feastin' on bread, cheese, peppers and, of course, garlic. Taste-wise, it lived up to the hype and was the favorite part of the meal for multiple people in our party.  We also got the house salad (basic, but good) and the Chimayo Chicken (stuffed with spinach, sun-dried tomatoes and cheese). Overall, really good, but the namesake GCP (Green Chile Potato) was disappointing and the carrots were underdone. I sampled the \"gumbo\" as well, which is nothing at all like a gumbo. It's basically jambalaya pasta.  The decor/ambiance is outstanding and the service is adequate. Would I say they're Top 50 in Arizona? Not sure, but they're definitely a high-quality restaurant/bar and worth visiting for the garlic plate alone. Try 'em out!",

We arrived at 4 pm and were told we could not order from the lunch menu, which is fine but then we could not order the prime rib from the dinner menu for another hour. None of the servers were fully sure of what we could and could not order or alter and none of these new rules were posted or stated anywhere. It seemed like everyone was just standing around waiting for us to order somethings so they could go talk about it and then come back to tell us we couldn't order it.

    "text": "My girlfriend and I came here because she insisted that she had to come here for nostalgic reasons. She said that for the price, the food was plentiful and cheap. We, by we I mean me, being typical thrifty Asian(s), I quickly agreed.   The parking lot is kind of small for a restaurant this size. There is valet there...but I hate shelling out cash for something I can easily do myself. Seeing as there was no parking...I had to get valet.   The service was fast. We got in there and were seated right away. The place is kind of dark and I almost tripped on a step that was hiding there, heh. Anyways, we were seated in a nice cozy booth. The place was dimly lit to create a more quiet and romantic/intimate atmosphere. Nicely pulled off with a Southwest style decor. I guess they do that because they kind of figure this is Mexican food. It seems the only thing Mexican about the cuisine is the abundant use of Hispanic names in only some of their dishes. I don't really care to be honest, if I wanted Mexican food...I'm sure there's a something-berto fast food place nearby anyways.   We ordered a bunch of the small plates as per my lady's recommendation. They came probably around 20 minutes later...not bad waiting time I suppose with probably a dozen or two patrons here. Calamari, delicious. Prime rib sliders, delicious. Bruschetta with a bunch of sauces, delicious. We got like one or two more dishes. The only reason why I gave this place three stars was the scallops. They were sooooo salty. Literally, when I bit into it...first thing that came to mind was water. Don't get me wrong, if it wasn't salty it would've been a fine dish and a fine meal for a nice night. However, these scallops were so salty...they made everything else I ate that night salty in flavor.   I wouldn't mind coming here again and I wouldn't mind recommending this place. I would only advise anybody planning here to be careful with the scallops. I don't know...maybe it was a fluke.",

Was worried after reading some of the recent reviews online but our overall experience was fantastic.  I highly recommend the basement bar, very cool little hideaway.",

First, the size of the Prickly Pear margaritas has been cut in half. Unfortunately, the price is the still the same. Also, Happy Hour at Rokerij is just plain awful. It used to be fantastic - cheap appetizers and great beer and wine prices. Now the appetizers are basically 10% off. Yea - feel like I brought a coupon.   The menu has shrunk down a bit, but the choices are still very good. I am a big fan of the Pasta Heidi. It still delivers - tasty chicken and spicy sauce.   I am certain that I will still frequent Rokerij, but probably not as often.   N*joy...",

    "text": "The bf and I wanted Dick's Hideaway for breakfast, and were not particular about which location we ate off the menu from. For some reason. we just didn't feel like being cramped in the location next to Luci's today. Very glad we tried the Rokerij! It was not busy for breakfast, so we got a giant comfy booth to ourselves. It was nice and dark inside which we like!   The service was fine. We had Ryno today, and he was outgoing, spoke about a few menu items, and generally came back in a reasonable amount of time.   I decided to try something different, and got the dungeness crab omelet featured on the blackboard. It was a generous amount of crab, peppers and onions, paired with the standard tortilla, potatoes and beans.  Not something I'd order on a regular basis, but this whole place is a bit of an adventure and the crab omelet really hit the spot. He got the meatloaf and eggs, mmm spicy!! You have to ask for ketchup for your potatoes, and we were only brought one ramekin, but that's okay. It sufficed.  We don't really care for free valet as we are fully capable of parking our own car, but at least when we walked out, they brought our car immediately.  Overall, not enough for the 5th star, but it's worth the drive for something different. We are dying to come back for lunch sometime and try that Pasta Heidi or Chimayo Chicken!  I could find the back door and restrooms here, too. The ladies' room was clean with interesting artwork on the wall. This is silly, but I loved that they had the nice soft paper towels. Maybe that's why the menu prices are so high lol.",

    "text": "I'm glad we made a reservations!  On Wednesday at 8:30pm it was packed, which is a good sign!  We were greeted right away and were taken downstairs to their cozy basement (or cellar I should say).  It is very inviting with wooden ceilings and rafters with alluring stone fireplaces and leather lounge chairs.  I felt like I should be drinking scotch or bourbon down there!  We were seated by our waiter who was quite charming considering the full bar of people chattering away.  I should also note, we were placed in a great spot in the corner where you could observe the busy room or simply enjoy your company as if we were in a room to ourselves.    We ordered two glasses of wine, and the Mushroom Brie Toast to start.  The toast was pretty unique and tasty, with a variety of mushrooms piled on perfectly toasted French bread with the perfect amount of cheese laced atop. For an entree I ordered the Ahi Tuna Salad with a soy vinaigrette.  It was good, with a healthy portion of perfectly cooked ahi, but the salad was kind of boring to me (mixed greens and tomatoes).  The vinaigrette was a bit on the soy-y side for me too...Yes I know that is what the dressing is called; I just expected something a bit more exciting and less salty.    My date had the NY strip.  It was prepared to temperature and covered in mushrooms, which we probably should have thought of pairing with and alternate appetizer...I think he had his fill of mushrooms for a month hahah!  But it was good nonetheless.  The asparagus was was gone first, so I am assuming it was delicious and the mashed potatoes (came in a little pot on the side) were just kind of boring.  Personally, I would have served the potatoes on the plate with the steak to soak up the wonderful au jus!    All in all we had a wonderful evening, in a great atmosphere, with great service and good food.  I would recommend it and I will be back!",

My initial impression was great!  \"Complimentary\" valet parking, fantastic mood/atmosphere.  We came here for a friend's birthday.  We got the sirloin toast and artichoke dip appetizers and they were amazing!  I would come back just for those as my meal.    However, our entrees were another story.  Our server was pretty pathetic making us feel like any time she had to visit our table was an inconvenience to her.  Then, after getting our food the birthday girl wasn't happy with her steak.  We all tried a bite and it was pretty dang charred and dry... even for medium well which is what she ordered.  No big deal, we will just say something and make it right.  So she tells the server she wasn't happy about her steak and the server responded, \"well, you did order it medium-well.\"  True, but she sucked as a server.  If a customer is unhappy you say sorry we will make it right.  Our friend was not rude at all.  The manager came to check it out and was VERY pleasant and took care of the situation.   I only gave the place 3-stars because my wife's meal was also very bland and my other friend was unhappy with their entree.  The atmosphere and appetizers were great, but considering the prices they charge and the entrees served just not impressed... :/",

From the moment you walk down the steps underground to the Rokerij you are about to be transformed from any experience offered in the Phoenix metro.  The place is so intimate with no windows,  lit candles everywhere and even a couch that you can cozy up with someone special next to a fireplace.   Food choices are great, not cheap unless you take advantage of their happy hour.  The wine list is very diversified with many selections.  The servers/bartenders take care of you with a pleasant smile and know how to make everyone feel special.  The Rokerij is definitely a great place to take your spouse or date to in an intimate setting unlike any other places in Phoenix.  If you'd also like to impress some out of town friends this would be a phenomenal choice to wow them.  If you haven't been here, Go.  No excuses!",

    "text": "Well after tonight's dinner I left very full as I usually do when I leave Rokerij. But we did not leave satisfied with the service or with that normal food high ( Damn that was delicious I want more, right now) as I have in the past 5 years we have been patrons, which is a bummer.   Over the last 2 or so years I feel like we've seen their best servers and bartenders all leave! Makes you wonder. Anyway, Service was one of the things we initially loved about Rokerij's intimate setting and it really sucked tonight.   We sat downstairs at the bar top like we usually do. There were 5 other people as guests downstairs. It wasn't busy although it happened to be during the late night happy hour. The bartender( name on our bill says Phil)  seemed immediately annoyed. Cheer up Phil.   I won't bore you with what we ordered, but it was the bartenders attitude and rude demeanor that were extremely off putting.   You couldn't even call the 5 people seated downstairs a crowd, I shouldn't have to flag you down to put in 2 appetizers! I want to eat, and spend money!   Hey, I know everyone has rough days. I actually had a tough day at work and came here thinking I could relax and unwind! We came with the full intent of ordering entrees( and both did)  but his assumption that we were just in it for the 5$ apps was an amateur move and rude. He rolled his eyes when I asked if we could put in our order for entrees. That should have been my cue to just stick with the apps since that seemed to be as much as this dude could handle.   Mind you, it was only 1030 and the kitchen closes at midnight so it's not like we were super last minute.  He never once asked us how any of the food was because it was apparent he didn't care. Shame. One app came out cold ( luckily I am a slave to sloppy joes and was starving so I quickly gobbled it up anyway) and my burger was dry and not cooked to order. Which has never happened to me when previously ordering here.   As soon as our entrees arrived , shortly after 11pm, he was already starting to clean up the bar (which is open til 1 am). Suddenly beside me he is slamming down overgrown tulips in bud vases and blown out votive candles from all the surrounding tables. Ex-nay ambiance. As well as the salt n pepper shakers. Coulda used that for my entree, ha!   I also had to ask for the bill twice. What gives? I bet Richardson (the owner) doesn't stress out about yelp reviews but as repeat loyal guests we felt unwelcome and disappointed by the serious lack of service, which is important to us.   I'm not so dramatic that I'll say we're never going back, because I live down the street and this has been one of our fave places.. just disappointed that I have to *hope* it's going to be better next time. Ugh.",

    "text": "Be sure to get a reservation:  Nothing here was as shiny as the build up to the place. This is a trendy spot, and like so many trendy places, the flash in the pan goes away with the crowd to the next trendy place. Let's start with the name, our waitress explained that Rokerij is a word that the Swiss use for smoke house. There is virtually nothing on this restaurants menu that has anything to do with a Swedish Smoke House. Please be warned... NOTHING TO DO WITH SMOKE HOUSE COOKING!  The menu blends the food from Richardson's (New Mexican cusine) which adjoins this place with a spiced version of American Classics.  OK here is the blow by blow...  It is my Daughters birthday dinner, she asked if we could have it at the Rokerij as she and her sister had tried to get in on a Friday or Saturday and the wait was about 3 hours. She was excited that this would be something special. It's Monday and the 5 of us arrive in stages. Jo and I were first, the parking seems to be shared with Richardson's it appears to be limited and Valet only.... It says complimentary, however it is just rude not to tip a valet.  The valet took the car and pointed us to the outer stairs to the lower level. This is a bar and it was full of puppy yuppies... OK it is a lame reference back in time but it fits.  We asked about the reservation that my daughter placed, they pointed us back up and around an interior staircase. Up above we were met by the young gal at reception and again we asked about the reservation that they looked up and did not find. There were plenty of empty tables so they did seat us right away. Good for starters... ***Here is another tip Monday nights many of the bottles of wine on the list are half priced*** We ordered a Malbec it was passable. If I was paying the full $30 for the bottle it would have been disappointing.  My birthday girl arrived so we ordered the Mushroom Toast appetizer, it was not bad or outstanding in anyway. But good drink and conversation was the key to the moment. My youngest soon arrived and the decisions as to what to eat began in earnest. One steak, two salads, the creme brulee, and relleno platter with one beef and one pork...  Did I mention that the menu was printed on place-mats? That there are no smoke house items on the menu... That the menu has Schnitzel, Mexican, Duck with Orange Chipolte, and a miss mash of other cuisines... I think the Chef or Mr Richardson lost track of what they were trying to do. You can see the menu online, but I for one can't figure out what the essence of this place is.   I am so sorry that the expectation was so much more than the meal. I really don't like to dis an establishment. It is a beautiful location in the place that Timothy's Jazz Club was once. But nothing came out that was exceptional except the creme brulee. The rest was simply not great. Not worth the cost... and you will not be sorry if you take a pass on this place.  One last sorry note, the waitress knew that it was my Daughter's birthday and did absolutely nothing to acknowledge that. No dessert... no nothing... If you are reading this Mr Richardson... you should be ashamed ...",

We were going for a dinner that we would be talking about for times to come, and that is exactly what we got. The only problem is, is that our meal was terrible. The meals that we ordered was the Filet, Halibut, Prime NY and the 20oz Porterhouse. The Halibut and Filet were exceptional but the Prime NY was cooked properly but was exceedingly tough. More than half of the steak was left on the plate to be discarded. The 20oz Porterhouse should have never been added as a special. The steak was so thin that it should have been an embarrassment for your restaurant to even serve.  On a more positive note, the brussel sprouts, Richardsons potato, asparagus and the mashed potatoes were superb as well as the creme brulee. The ambiance of your restaurant was just what we were looking for as well.   In conclusion, we got together for dinner last night and couldn't stop talking about our experience at your restaurant and we felt compelled to communicate this with you.",

Ordered my usual but with a waiter that is known to notice the best.  He was too busy singing to the '70 songs playing and left our food in the window too long.  After knowing after many years you can't touch the plate, well. I could pick it up and the red chile was PASTE!  No big deal right? Just being a fresh order ? - NO! The new \"GM\" comes up and shows a ticket with times and refutes that the plates were sitting in the window.  Though I tried to tell him I was regular, he conveys that he was a regular for 26 years and yes sometimes the plates were \"not hot.\"  Ummm ok but please don't spit in my face while talking and certainly not raise your voice.  Check please!!!!  After many years, it has continued to go down from changing the menu to experiences like this.

It is located next door to Richardsons and shares some of the same menu items.  You walk downstairs the underground bar and you instantly feel like you've entered a different scene.  The place is small and consists mainly of a bar, a couple of booths and some cozy spots to curl up next to the fire.  It feels a little dark and small inside but I know that's what they were going for.    The Rokerij is known for their happy hour but honestly, the menu prices don't seem like a great deal during happy hour.  Appetizers are only a couple dollars cheaper during happy hour.  We visited on a Friday night and the place was packed.  We were able to find a spot at the bar after a few minutes.  The service is good at the Rokerij - older, experiences bar tenders and servers who are knowledgeable about the menu and drink offerings.  Our waiter made some great suggestions on the menu which is always appreciated.    The food is great, but slightly over priced for the area.  I would stick with the unique items on the menu that Richardsons is known for - meat and southwest items.   This is not a great place for vegetarians but there are several fish items on the menu",

I requested a new meal as this one had half a glass of water on it. He said no and said they would only replace the beans. My wife asked if he would eat that or expect that for a $50 meal? We were all flabbergasted. I asked to speak to the manager and our waitress came over and I told her the situation but.  and the busser then denied having spilled my drink at all. The waitress replaced the meal but after having had to argue with one of the staff I was not really in a good mood and it really soured the experience for all of us. I was really taken off guard by the interaction and really would expect better from a restaurant such as this.",

Had I known there were specials before I placed my order, I probably would have ordered one of those items. I don't remember specifically what my partner ate, but it was also too spicy, as if someone dumped a spoonful of chili powder in the sauce.     Only thing saving my experience was the ambiance.

One of the cooks in the kitchen was whistling during our entire meal and one of the cooks (or chef maybe?) was so rude to everyone- customers asking questions, and other staff members. The cellar is supposed to be cool, that's what we made our reservation for, but unfortunately there was a mix up and our table was given away to someone else and apparently there wouldn't be a single other opening for the rest of the evening (this was on a Sunday in August...) so we sat upstairs. No apology or offer of compensation whatsoever from the staff.  The menu looked amazing, but it was so disappointing. My medium rare prime rib was tough, dry and well done, our waiter (that was not friendly at all) never checked on us after dropping the food off so I just picked at it. The jus that came with it was really unappetizing- tasted like tap water and grease and rosemary. My husband's New York strip that was supposed to also be medium rare was purple and cold on the inside. He ate around the edges. Like I said, no one ever checked on us, and the attitude of our server made us really not want to bring anything up. You'd think a server would notice two almost untouched meals when he dropped off the check.  Oh and this was all on my birthday.",

Then, we shared the Pumpkin Pie Enchilada which was basically an enchilada filled with a pumpkin pie cream cheese. And lastly we had coffee!  Amazingly enough the bartender was also our waitress and she was able to tend the bar and take care of us which was incredible. I can't say enough about the ambiance as well - tons of candles throughout. And how can you not love a bar with a fireplace and big comfy couches?

The service was... less than I expected for the price point and the ambience. 15 minutes for 2 wine samples, which the wine was good. So credit for having good wine. Food quality was great. But it took about 45 minutes. Typically if it's longer than 20 minutes, a manager should come to the table and at least explain what's going on. It's not a massive restaurant and we realized that the kitchen is small. But a table touch would've meant a lot... offer something to at least snack on. We also felt judged several times being there. We planned on 10, 6 came but I made a reservation. From the moment we broke the news, it was a MAJOR inconvenience. Things were expressed about 'being fair' for the servers. From that moment I knew whoever would be 'stuck with a party of 6' was going to be miserable. And yes, he appeared less than satisfied. Overall I wouldn't go back solely on the experience, which the price point says I should be enjoying. No reason a beer should take almost 15 minutes, nor a glass of wine. Our server was honestly pretty MIA. When asked to split the check, it was apparent he didn't want to and was a major problem. Having been a server and bartender, this shouldn't be a major issue. (Especially if you use ALOHA or a similar system).  Great food, but don't go here if you expect decent service.",

Cozy, dark, and welcoming- this is a place you can get lost in.  Grabbed a seat at the bar, and were warmly greeted. Ordered margaritas and some small plates, they were both outstanding. Tried numerous small plates, and each one was delicious and hit the spot.  If you like margaritas, you will be a happy camper. Also try the stuffed mushrooms, they are amazing.  After leaving my new favorite place, we went to the Taste of Scottsdale, and it was surprising that none of the food there was HALF as good as what Rokerij provided. After a few samples, my group gave up, as it wasn't fair to our stomachs to put average food with amazing Rokerij food. All in all, not a bad problem to have.",

I love going to Rokerij's dimly lit bar in the basement on a Sunday morning while devouring my Enchiladas and Eggs. I always get the same dish every time, but its like a party in my mouth with every bite. I've also come here for their great happy hour specials. How can anyone pass up $5 small dishes, which honestly are not small at all. No one will ever be disappointed with the outstanding customer service, food, drinks, and cozy environment that Rokerij has to offer.   P.S. Remember to always make reservations for diner.",

Actually it would have been 1 star if it was based on the service.  By the way I'm the one that ordered Jordan Chardonnay, And then I asked you about the rose,  if it's French style. And you said it's Italian. I know it's Italian.  You should turn your frown upside down.  I love where I work. If you don't love where you work, You shouldn't work there. Same goes for the girl who was your barback or bartender.",

I LOVED their enchiladas!!  You get a choice of 3 -- I tried the shrimp, cheese & chicken.  My husband had steak that he loved.    They have a great margarita & they can make it without the spicy tequila.    The cream brulee wasn't blah that night & a bit watery or something.    We'll definitely be back sooner this time!:-).

Although not everything we tried was foot stompin' great, it was obvious there was the promise of great food in order here.  What we'd come back for...Oysters Rokerij (a spinoff of Oysters Rockefeller) and their steaks.    I was not impressed with the Southwestern cuisine we tried on another day.   Now we know what not to order.  That's OK.  Come fairly early if you want good parking.  Parking can be a challenge. No doubt, there is a good wait on the weekends too.  Yes, we will enthusiastically come back when in Phoenix again.",

I have my daughter every other weekend and whenever she stays over we make it a point to walk over for brunch at least one morning if not both that she's here.  The pancakes are great and to be perfectly honest, between the three large pancakes that they bring out - the plate of eggs and stack of bacon (or whatever other meat you choose) this easy feeds the two of us and is very reasonably priced.  From the adult side of the menu, you can't go wrong with tenderloin benedict topped with jalapeno hollandaise sauce.    Lunch / Dinner depending on the occasion choose between the normal topside restaurant or the intimate setting of the basement - this place will never fail to deliver.  Fantastic blend of perfectly prepared meat / fish with a slightly southwestern flare in the accompanying sauces and sides.  Happy Hour - Reverse or not - Get a spot at the pounded copper bar and enjoy one of the better \"food special\" happy hours in the neighborhood.  $5 small plates are a steal and the ambiance of the basement fireplace can't be beat. (Perfect for a date night)",

The answering service promised an answer within 24 hours. 72 hours later, no response. I called back, and the very curt and impolite receptionist informed me that the restaurant doesn't take reservations for groups smaller than four! I thought this had to be an error, this is supposed to be a romantic establishment! I called back and talked to Mario, an equally curt and impolite Manager, who re - affirmed the \"no reservations for groups smaller than four\" policy. When I expressed my disbelief at such a policy, Mario promptly hung up on me. I called the Stockyards, and they were more than happy to take my reservation for a romantic anniversary dinner table for two.  If you are a couple looking for a nice dinner experience,  the Rokerij isn't worth your trouble. According to their own manager, they would prefer that you go elsewhere.",

Someone brought us waters but no one greeted us for at least 5 minutes, so we decided to move down to the bar downstairs. It was only a couple minutes before happy hour ended and the bartender threw in some food and drinks for us which we were delighted by. But the rest of the visit was less than pleasing. Both of the bartenders were detached and not warm, or welcoming. I honestly felt like we were a burden (although there were only three other people at the bar) it felt like we were getting the cold shoulder. The guy bartender did not smile once. Let alone make eye contact. FOOD: the oysters were more disappointing. They were not shucked whatsoever and they were too large, and did not taste fresh. I let them know and they were taken from me but without apology or any action taken to remedy the situation besides taking half of the order off of the bill.  Needless to say we decided not to order anything else, the uncomfortable visit went on long enough.  I'm extremely disheartened by this and when before I would recommend this place to friends, I will not be returning and I will not subject others to this.",

The bartender, Phil, not only made a fabulous Manhattan, but his knowledge of the menu impressed.  With so many amazing options, I don't think we ever would have decided without Phil's guidance.    We finally settled on the Shrimp Piri Piri, (essentially a chopped Shrimp Scampi) made more delicious after adding a few squeezes of lemon.  We also enjoyed the Roasted Garlic Plate which you should not order if you don't like garlic or peppers.  For dinner we both selected from the specials board.  I had the Blackened Tuna with a Strawberry Champagne sauce, an interesting combination of savory, spice, and sweetness.  My friend had the Sea Bass and felt it was just ho-hum.    Overall the evening was lovely.  We met several friendly people and enjoyed delightful food and service.  However, the $180 bill came as a bit of a shock.  Because of the price, this restaurant will be reserved for special occasions only.",

    "text": "I visited not too long ago. For awhile it's been declining. However this time was the worst and I will not ever be returning, and neither will anyone with me. This is in regards to their kitchen, hopefully the health department is aware of this as well. My boyfriend and I went to the Rokerij on A Sunday we opted for the downstairs bar seating as i've always liked the ambiance and it best! :) We walked down and it was empty, we asked if we could sit in a booth and we were told they were all reserved and we could sit at the bar.  We didn't mind and just sat at the bar, I never mind sitting there.  We just wanted a little more privacy for his birthday but no biggie.  We were given menus, we ordered the Artichoke Dip appetizer and both ordered the Porkchop-both sounding delicious.  The appetizer came out fairly quick and was however soupy and possibly one of the worst i've had.  Our entrees were the concerning issue, however.  After waiting 20 minutes after our appetizer was done, our entree came out.  We both were hungry and dug in, to find both pork chops raw as all heck.  We waved down the bartender and told him, he told us to put them on separate plates, then just took our plates back.  He explained to us that he asked them to cook them medium rare because they come out dry a lot if you don't.  First of all, I appreciate trying to think ahead, but maybe don't serve something that comes out bad all the time?  I don't appreciate that the kitchen would send out ANY sort of poultry not cooked, raw, especially when it wasn't requested in the first place.  This is disgusting.  We never even received an apology, smile, nothing.  They came back out 10 minutes later, the same plates, and the bartender asked us to cut in and make sure they were cooked.  Why is that our job? The bartender also ignored the birthday situation, which I didn't exactly push but made known, just kind of lame.  Too add, only one couple came in during the hour and a half we were there, and were given explanations to the specials and menu in detail, while we were apparently a bother.  I get reservations, but... All in all, possibly the worst dining experience i've had in a while, and definitely won't return to any and I don't recommend Perry the bartender and his rude attitude.  To add, I emailed to let the owners know and received NO reply. Horrible customer service.",

    "text": "Was unfortunately disappointed in our dining experience here. The menu has a good mix of Southwestern food, with some European dishes like schnitzel thrown into the menu. There is also a separate menu on the chalkboard which includes steak and seafood. I had the sea bass with roasted cauliflower and tried some rack of lamb with Brussels sprouts.   The portion of food was good, but when I received my food my first thought was \"This is it? I paid $39 for this?\" The food looked like it was dumped on my plate with no special thought on plating and was simply breaded fish and cauliflower. Now this is fine if I'm getting an informal casual meal but for the price a little panache or maybe more elements in the dish would be nice so I feel like I'm eating something that looks better and more varied than what I could eat at home. The sea bass was breaded and crusted with pine nuts, and covered in a sweet sauce. I couldn't remember what the sauce consisted of and it tasted too generically sweet for me. It needed some acid to balance out the flavor and I used a lemon wedge on an iced tea glass to squeeze some juice on the fish which made it taste a lot better. The cauliflower was well prepared and had some nice caramelization along the edges from roasting.   I tried some lamb too ($39) which was perfectly medium rare, but could use just a touch more seasoning. It had a smoky flavor which was nice.  Since we were the lone table in the corner next to the bar, our waiter was actually the bartender. He did a good job though helping the bar patrons while serving and refilling our drinks. Note that sodas are by the bottle but iced tea has unlimited refills.  Overall while I thought the food was OK, it was very overpriced for what you get. Also note that the parking here seems to be strictly valet (Although complimentary).  I do love the atmosphere here though, with the dark wood, the dim lighting, excellent music (A mix of artists from Santana to Beck), and the lush, comfortable seating.  P.S. For those that are wondering (I definitely was before I came here!) it's pronounced ro-ker-ee and it means \"smokehouse\" in Dutch.",

    "text": "JD invades AZ Day 1:  Rokerij (pronounced Ro-k-ray and is the Dutch Word for Smokehouse (which raises a whole slew of questions that I won't get into) is listed as one of \"Arizona's 50 Best Restaurants\" by one of the local food bloggers (Ricky Lee Potts). It also came highly recommended by my Dad, and knowing how picky he is, I knew I had to check this place out.   Appetizers/Small Plates:  Bacon-Wrapped Scallops- I saw this as one of the review highlights and knew I had to have it. The BWS were huge, cooked perfectly and they are served with four amazing sauces that are the Chef's choice for the night. On this night they were 2 kinds of Green Salsa, Red Salsa and a Hollandaise sauce. My clear favorites were the Hollandaise and the Red Salsa but they were all good. 5*  Pan-Seared Salmon- Small bite-sized pieces of Salmon with a Chipotle-Mayo. The Salmon itself could've used some seasoning but the Chipotle-Mayo was excellent. 4*  Santa Fe Trail:  Carne Adovada- Smoked Pork shoulder that's simmered in a Red Chile sauce and served with Rice and Beans. The Rice and Beans were pretty standard, but the Pork itself was excellent. It literally seemed to get better and better as the meal went on but it also got progressively hotter and hotter as the meal went on; I was sweating like Britney Spears on Jeopardy by the time I was done eating. 4.5*  Chile Potato- Apparently this is one of the dishes that Rokerij is famous for. It's a fire-roasted green Hatch Chile that's stuffed with a mashed potato mixture. I'm not sure if I had it on an off-night, or what, but it just didn't do it for me. I mean everything was there for a stupendous dish but there just wasn't any flavor. I had my sis and Bro-in-law try some just to verify it wasn't me and they agreed it was a fail. 2*  Beverages- Rokerij has a really impressive wine selection -which I'm not really into- and a mediocre beer selection; I was not impressed with their draft selection. They also have an uber-cool underground (literally and figuratively!) bar that is separate from the restaurant itself; I can imagine the shenanigans that ensue there! 4*  Service & Ambiance- Our waitress was very friendly and extremely knowledgeable about the menu because my sister always has questions (Oy gevalt...) and she answered them all quickly and to her satisfaction. Rokerij is very dark; has a nice wood and brick interior; and even has a fireplace going at all times--which is kinda odd seeing that it's in Arizona. The ambiance is definitely set for a date night kinda mood: very romantic and sexy--not the place you wanna bring a precocious 3-year-old (Whoops!). 4.75*  Value- Pretty good value for a really nice place like this. I'd say the avg entree runs anywhere from $15-30; which is pretty good for high quality food. 4*  If you're looking for a great restaurant to impress a special someone; a place to celebrate a special event; or even something as casual as a date night then this is the place for you. I wouldn't recommend bringing kids with you as it's just not a kid friendly place and that's ok, too. You don't have to take the little monsters everywhere.",

It's nice!  8 of us visited Rockerij yesterday for happy hour .. amongst us we had the following:  Margaritas, Tito's straight up, Dirty Martinis, Craft Beers, Chipotle Ribs, Bacon Wrapped Shrimp, Sliders, Rich's Skewer, and Calamari ... Everything .. everything was scrumptious   There's also a reverse happy hour from 10 - close.  I must give it a try!",

My boyfriend ordered the Chilean sea bass and I got the halibut. We got meatloaf sliders as an appetizer. Everything was delicious. We had planned to go to another bar after dinner, but we went downstairs to check it out and ended up staying there the rest of the night. The bartender was awesome and we really enjoyed ourselves. Definitely a great place for date nights and special occasions. Just plan to spend some time there; it's very busy and popular!",

What are you kidding? No, we only have 5 in the restaurant. WOW. Also, they do not do anything for birthdays not even a candle? That is crazy when you go to a \"nice\" place like the Rokerij at least give a cookie and a candle.",

    "text": "ONE OF THE MOST HORRIBLE RESTAURANTS FOR SERVICE!!!!!! This is what I put on my \"check in status\" when I arrived there, I got there at 7:30 on time for my reservation and didn't get seated for my table until 7:45pm. The staff asked me twice if I wanted to seat outside and both times I said yes that's what I put down for my reservation ... I don't like to repeat myself! The manager had to ask his hostess if we had reservations or if we were walk ins and I was seating right next to him when he said it. \"He blew me off\" and finally we out there and cleaned off my table and didn't say anything when he walked in till I got in front of him and asked him are we good to seat down it's been fifteen mins he said yes with an attitude! Restaurant etiquette usually states if you have a reservation and your on time, you should be seated at your table on time and no questions ask! Now for \"THE BIG PART\" so I took my gfs parents out for this restaurant for my gfs dad \"Early Fathers Day\" Dinner... on my side I was wanting to impress and make sure when I wow someone or somebody of that importance, shit should be on point! But it wasn't, when we sat down... we ordered our food at 7:55pm, and we didn't get our food until 8:45pm, almost a Fucking hour!!! it's funny everyone else looked and felt like they waited a long time as well. The other funny part is the manager recognize these things for those ppl and cut their checks in half. Not ONCE did he come to our table say how the food is or the service... he avoided me/us. Luckily the food was Very good, best Carne Adovada I've ever had. So that's why I'm giving this place a star cause honestly the service FUCKING RUINED it!!! And to top it off I talked with the manager after we ate and told him 3 things... HORRIBLE Service, Waited an Hour on Our Food, and thank god your food was good cause I was about to take my business somewhere else. And I also told him I don't want a discount even though we deserve it just like everyone else you greeted and gave it too for the Shitty service!!! Had to be upfront as a Man and as someone who paid 168.00$ on dinner because there ain't NO WAY I was gonna leave without saying anything. Sooo if anyone with \"HIGHER POWER\" from that restaurant reads this, I hope you understand and realize that someone that wanted good service, DID NOT WHATSOEVER get any of that. I am sooo disappointed and this is the WORST REVIEW I have ever gave a restaurant. Everyone else that reads this, take this all with a grain of salt and prepare yourself for these things if your thinking of coming here.",

We used the valet and walked down stairs and were sat immediately. We were given a table in the corner. I felt like I was eating in a wine cellar. The ambiance and lighting were awesome.  Service was spot on.   The timing of drinks and food was perfect.  We started off with cocktails and the fresh artichoke dip. The full flavor of the artichokes was amazing. A lot of places cover up the flavor with cheese and salt. This dip set a benchmark.  I ordered the Adovada. The pork was seasoned well and had great New Mexico flavors.  My boyfriend ordered the seafood and he loved it.  Dessert was equally flavorful.   We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "Damn I hate to rate this place this low but they really dropped the ball last night.  I was able to get a last minute reservation at 8pm for our anniversary and that was more than gracious. Friends of mine have been talking about this place for years and I finally got the opportunity to try it out first hand.   When we arrived there was complimentary valet which was awesome.  Never having been here before it took a little asking around to find the downstairs bar where we had our reservation.  The hostess was super nice and helpful and told us our table wasn't ready yet but that the bartenders would know we were waiting.    The stairway down to the bar is fun,  yeah that sounds silly but it's cool. The downstairs bar ambience is sexy to say the least, including a fireplace:)  It's small yet welcoming and very warm.  We took a seat on the couch and one of the bartenders came by to get our drink order and informed us that he knew we were waiting for a table and that he would take care of us all night.  That he did.   We were informed our table would be a little late because the people were still sitting around a bit. No worries, we were all about taking it slow and enjoying ourselves. Once we were sat, our server came by and gave us a very informed, detailed explaination of the specials,  and honestly EVERYTHING sounded amazing.  Granted we usually eat dinner around 7pm and at this point it was around 8:20 ish. We were hungry:)  Orders were placed and wine was enjoyed, and then we waited. A very long time.  Once our food finally came around I was pretty damn unhappy.  Our server himself told us that our ticket time was 50 minutes!  Apparently a 40 top came in and their food was a priority over the few smaller tables.  Almost an hour after ordering we finally got our food and I could definitely tell our food was an afterthought. It tasted good,  not amazing,  and was barely just warm enough.  Couldn't tell if it had been sitting around or was thrown together half assed. Our server did the best he could but not once did a manager come by to apologize for the food issue.   They comp'ed us 2 drinks and gave us a free dessert. I dunno,  I just left with a bad taste in my mouth.  Definitely not an anniversary dinner I feel proud about bringing my husband to. That's frustrating.   Like I said,  ambience/drinks and service were top notch. The kitchen and management really fell through on this tonight. First and probably the last time I'll come here.    What a shame.",

But I was recently seated in the restaurant and ordered green chili enchiladas for dinner which were okay not bad but not the enchiladas I remember from a long time ago when I had brunch in the basement. The \"green chili\" was just that green chilies thrown in with some salty pork. Anyway the whole plate was not editable everything including the rice and beans was so spicy! I wanted to finish but simply could not. I wasn't the only one my brother his girlfriend and my boyfriend could not finish their plates either we've barely touched anything and our mouth's we're on fire. It was funny because we talked the place up so much and then none of us could even finish our food. Aside from that the service was great and margaritas were absolutely delicious!",

However,  all poached eggs ... 5 in all ..  were over cooked,  the English muffins were hard,  Dutch pancake was doughy, bacon wasn't crisp (as ordered) and the over medium eggs were under done.  One the positive, the beef tenderloin and king crab was cooked perfect.",

The service was awful... my wife got up a few times because they didn't give us napkins or silverware and no one ever came by our table. After she did that, we had like 4 people waiting on us, so we were constantly interrupted while we were eating.  The food was okay. We got the spinach and artichoke dip which was really good, but my wife's club sandwich fell apart once she got it and my steak sandwich was bland. It was literally just bread, steak and cheese.   The seating was also extremely uncomfortable. Each booth is a concrete slab with a thin layer of pillow for you to sit on. It's really weird considering that the rest of the restaurant is very eclectic and homey. Such a weird combination.  Anyway, we won't be back to eat here.",

When you are in the Rokeril you can forget that it is a seething inferno outside.  The only reason that I am giving them a 4 instead of a 5 is that their cuts of meat seem to be fattier than I am accustomed to...my SO and I have noticed this with both beef and lamb cuts.

    "text": "Tonight, I had a chance to show a brutha some culture.  When someone is taking me to dinner, I pick a place that I *know* is going to be a winner.  Rokerij didn't disappoint!  The parking lot was full, so I started to get scared that we wouldn't be able to get a table or have to *gasp* wait for one. At first, we had gone downstairs to eat there, but it was packed, so we headed to the restaurant.  From previous reviews, I was afraid it would be packed and we would have to find somewhere else to go eat.  I really wanted to impress the guy (HA even though he was buying!) and, luckily, there were a few empty tables upstairs. We were seated at the far end in a corner booth.  Any restaurants with booths get an A+ in my book.  I love sitting close to friends and a booth gives the perfect opportunity. Specials were neatly written on blackboards, but I was at a weird angle to read them.  Chris, our waiter, read them for us and explained each dish.  That was the high point of his service the rest of the night. As we perused the menu, our drink order was taken.  I really wanted to get the small plates and try a few different things, so we both chose 3 each.  I got the crab tostadas.  They were filled to the brim with crab, not too much dressing so the crab flavor wasn't drowned.  I also got the bacon-wrapped grilled shrimp (YUMMY!!!!) and the brie toasts.  Divine!  The cheese was melted perfectly, with just enough of its grease to soak into the bread.  I actually licked my fingers after each one. He got the skewered steak, shrimp on dirty rice and meat tacos.  The rice wasn't all that, but the rest of the dishes were superb! As we ate, and our drinks emptied, we had to call Chris over to get refills.  Not once had he checked on us during the meal.  It's the reason for 4 stars!  I was a bit disappointed in that.  For such a Valley favorite, I had hoped for a little more attention. Ambiance is key at Rokerij.  The smell of the wood-burning fireplace, the cozy booth and warm atmosphere gave me cause to want to go back again.  And, the brutha liked, it too!",

    "text": "I'd like to start off by saying that I do not eat anything made out of pig.  It isn't because I'm partial to how adorable pigs are and not chickens, but really because I was raised Muslim and Muslim's do not eat pig.  I no longer identify myself as a Muslim, but never felt compelled to jump on the pig wagon despite the religious affiliation change.  I grew up thinking that pig was disgusting meat to eat- and it isn't particularly good for you so I figured it'd be best to leave it out of my diet.    I ordered the enchilada plate.  You have a choice of chicken, pork, and turkey with portobello mushrooms.  My waiter asked me if I wanted one of each, at which time I explained that I do not want the pork one as I do not eat pork.  He seemed to understand this, but didn't bother to write it down.  Fast forward to our meals arriving- the lighting in this place is dungeon like and I had opted for the red chile sauce.  I was in the middle of my second bite when I realized that the meat I was eating didn't seem to be turkey, chicken or a mushroom.  I asked Dottsy to sample it, and she assured me that it was none of the things it should be.  When we waved our waiter over, he exclaimed, \"I'm not really sure what to do.\" Which was clearly a ridiculous response.  After thinking for a few seconds, he finally asked me if he could remake them, which he did.  Despite the major inconvenience, the enchilada plate was not taken off the bill and the waiter wasn't apologetic at all.    Another obnoxious thing is that Dottsy had ordered one of the small plate appetizers and despite the fact that it was a cold appetizer (tar tar), it was brought out with our main meal.  Someone might want to let them know the definition of an appetizer.  After reading such rave reviews, I expected an awesome dining experience.  I have never ate pork before, and it wasn't on my bucket list, but the waiter seemed to be apathetic about such a choice.  I avoid places that don't seem to care about my preferences.    Also, they do not have straws here.  When I drink a cocktail, I want a straw.  Icing on the awful cake.",

I always sit downstairs. I call it my \"dungeon\". Pretty tricky to get up the stairs after a few cocktails, hence the indoor elevator for the tipsy patron. I always order the tenderloin skewers and bacon wrapped sea scallops. I take dates here and they all love it. We sit by the fire and it's low key. Great place to just sit and be relaxed. If you go early, hard to find a seat (place is very small) and the service is slow sometimes.",

Yes, it's that scrumpthicous (I know its not spelled that way, but when your tongue is sticking out from drooling, thats exactly how its pronounced). Nice!  The menu is tip-top. Go with the small plates, they're fun and deee-lish. The music is played by an ibook/ itunes and I even heard Pete Rock & CL Smooth. That brought me back to ....92? Rad! Take Chris C's advice.

When we went to the new grand opening of Richardson's we were all so excited, but that soon faded with the horrible service, cramped eating areas, and food with no flavor other than hash or ancho chilies. I love chilies and I know that new mexican cuisine incorporates this ingredient a lot but that is all we tasted in all 4 of our different dishes. The cooks need to learn about portion control and tasting before serving. Very disappointed.",

The menu has some less traditional items- like the twice baked sweet potato served in a chile...MMMMM. Or the shredded crab meat that tops the steak...This is a Phoenix institution- and a must try.

The specials are on a blackboard above your head behind you if you are seated in the booths. You have the practically get out to read them. The paper menus have a lot of abbreviations so you have to keep remembering what the letters mean. I don't want to work that hard. Can't you just spell out the words? I ordered the surf and turf from the Richardson's side of the menu. What was delivered was an unappetizing mess. The plate and everything on it was covered in a chili sauce. It looked like dog food with a piece of steak in the middle. Really it was a terrible presentation. My husband's plate looked the same. The other two at our table ordered from the Rokerij side and at least it looked a lot better. The two bacon wrapped shrimp were flavorful and my steak was over cooked for medium but OK. I could have skipped the messy beans or at least they could put them in a cup. I may try them again but just for happy hour and I'll keep the Rokerij side of the menu.",

I am sooooooooo very sad that we discovered it two weeks before I moved out of the state. We had a wonderful experience with the wait staff and I liked the ambiance very much. But the FOOD, oh man, the food! I was blown away by this place. I would not have expected to find some of the best Mexican food in this somewhat uppity joint. But it truly was some of the most amazing flavors I have experienced. The green chili meatloaf with eggs was great but there was this unique flavor to the chili relleno that I am not sure anyone could replicate. And the Carne Adobada was seriously tasty; it was cooked perfectly and was just as amazing the next day as leftovers. This place is a gem!",

Our server was nice but a little forgetful about some little things (eg: ice bucket for our white wine). Overall food was pretty good.  Appetizers: 1) Bacon Wrapped Pan Seared Scallops: well cooked and loved the 4 different dipping sauces (green chile, salsa, tomato?, butter). 2) Stuffed mushrooms: little mushroom heads but they were still good and the sauce wasn't bad.  Entrees: 1) Sea bass in mango sauce with a side of eggplant and potato with green chile 2) New Mexico Enchiladas 3) Ahi Tuna Salad over mixed greens 4) Rokerij burger - everything was pretty good. My only complaint was that the tuna was a little over cooked (requested it medium rare and it came out more medium/medium-well)",

Generally my wife and I have gone here for reverse-HH, $5 wine and $5 small plates. (You cannot miss with the Tri-color roasted pepper bruschetta). Truth be told, we rarely stick to just the HH items. I can't resist the Rokerij salad (a magical wedge...get it with the turkey) and a good G&T (a nice pour and a 4.5 oz bottle of Fever Tree tonic). If HH isn't your thing, go for brunch or....dinner...as we finally did last Sunday.   A group of six of us came in for dinner, aside from an awesome meal and great service (thank you, Jamie), we lucked into coming in on a day when they were serving green chile stew (spice-tastic) and 1/2 off bottles of wine. What?!?!? It was fantastic. My wife loved the smoked turkey and the green chile pork enchiladas (thanks, Richardson's) and another member of the party claimed the top sirloin was \"the best she'd ever had.\" A great night was had by all.

It's pretty frustrating when I'm trying to grab a late night meal because I don't want to succumb to any late night fast casual's or fast food joints. The only reason why I am giving this review more than one star is because of Connor and the kitchen at the Rokerij.

I was very impressed at the number of wines on the list that were available at half price. The deal is good Sunday and Monday.

The beers were always full, the food was served without a delay and our guest was impressed, and that is exactly why we take clients there. Dinner is pricey, but I have never been overcharged and always welcomed when you walk in. I am looking forward to Richardson's opening so it will be a bit easier to get tables downstairs.  Thanks!",

    "text": "Okay.    This is an update to my prior review.   Either I don't care for their \"southwestern\" food, or it's just not that good, but this time I tried the beef tenderloin served over pasta.    YUMMMM!! is all I have to say for the meat.    It was tender and flavorful.    Tender in that it did not have that strange consistency of beef that was of lower quality and tough, therefore, \"tenderized\" with I-have-no-idea what, which makes me wonder what it would do to my insides after I ate it.  Anyway, back to the review.   The pasta was not of the white, bleached to near non edible that most pasta is now days.    And it was cooked to oh, so slightly al dente.     Of course, the flavoring for the pasta was just about perfect as well.     I topped it off with a couple of glasses of their zinfandel.    I don't remember the vineyard.    I just remember it was #27 on the wine list.    My companion had some sort of chicken skewers with beans and rice.    I've had the chicken skewers before.   And beans and rice on the side is not something I'd write home about.   So I didn't taste it.     He seemed to like it so I guess that's all that counts.",

This is a super chill spot on 16th Street with a fantastic Happy Hour and Reverse Happy Hour that rivals any in town with lots of great food options and a really good selection of wines for $5 at Happy Hour prices. The atmosphere is great and there is an open grill right in front of the bar where you can watch your food being prepared, a huge fire place area that is really chill for just chatting with a date. It is one of those environments that just can't help but relax you after a long week.   If you go make sure and check out the downstairs, it is very hidden and not easily accessible but i have found only a few places better for a first date (not a blind date LOL) than the rokerij.",

    "text": "Easily awesome.  Had dinner here with a few friends last night. We were at a booth in the downstairs bar. Great atmosphere once you walk into the place. All the wood and stone did remind me of Amsterdam and all the underground restaurants I've been to in Prague. Great, diverse selection of music playing, excellent & very friendly service, great wine, and the food...man.   We started with the Charcuterie & Cheese Platter, which was excellent. We then chose to share four mini-dinners (aka small plates) - steak tartare, beef tenderloin skewers, pan seared scallops with dipping sauces, and the empenadas. All were top notch. We then had berries & in-house vanilla bean ice cream for dessert. Pair that with a few bottles of wine and we were good to go. We easily stayed there for 3 hours or so...not because of service being slow, but because Rokerij's the kind of place you want to take the time and enjoy your dinner, your wine, and your company at. I'm definitely coming back here, well, many times again.  We also had a sneak peek of the upstairs dining room, which is no longer upscale with white tablecloths. The owner, Sam Richardson (he also owns Richardson's and Dick's Hideaway) wanted the upstairs room to feel more laid-back and comfortable like it is downstairs so he changed the interior quite a bit apparently. From what the staff showed us, it looks great to me.  Rokerij's a huge winner in my books. Can't wait to head back there again.",

From the street, it looks like a dive but when you get in there, it is pretty cool.  We sat downstairs at the bar.  It's pretty dark in there.  There were (3) menus to choose from; too many choices made it hard to decide.  We were there around 11:30 so we decided to split a couple of different items to try more things. We ordered a combo plate of one eggs benedict with jalapeno sauce and the meat was this slice of heaven, I mean pork loin roast.  It was fabulous.  It also came with two blue corn tortilla chicken enchiladas in a green chile sauce - yummy.  We also had the philly cheese steak - the steak was ok - lacked a bit of flavor and the cheese was non existent but the fries were the skinny crispy ones and they were delicious.  The bartender seemed a bit dull and unhelpful.  We were asking her what her favorites on the menu were (we love when the wait staff rave about the food and talk about the ingredients in expressive detail) and she said, \"everything\".  We were left to our own to decide but we did pretty good.    We checked out the upstairs and it looked pretty cool.    This is New Mexico food, which is different than traditional mexican food.  Traditional mexican is one dimensional, new mexico mexican food has an array of spices and depth - much more flavorful.",

We ordered, and waited and waited. Our waitress had another table that she was far more interested in than us and our service was subpar, a disppointment considering how excited we were to be there. The food was good but not the quality of Richardsons, something different. We paid our bill and quietly left, unacknowledged.   We will return to the cellar bar for drinks and to Dicks hideaway for dinner and continue to anxiously await the reopening of our beloved Richardsons.",

I had the most amazing chicken, and the sides, which usually I just take for granted as filler food, were sodelicious that they caught my attention in a big way.  I also tried my date's steak, and while it was fairly spendy, it sure seemed worth it.  The feel of the place is great too, with the dark stone walls and coziness without feeling too crowded.  We ventured downstairs to look at the bar, and had we been there early enough to snag a couch I wouldn't have wanted to leave.  It definitely feels like a splurge, or somewhere you'd take a business associate or date that you wanted to wow.  It's manages a high end feel, while remaining unmistakably local.

This is exactly the type of place I loved to go to back home in the winter when it was snowing outside.  The bartenders are super friendly.  The small plates are $5 during happy hour (although their drink special happy hour and food happy hour don't overlap) but like Melissa said you have to sit directly at the bar.  (Not next to it, not across from it, AT the bar.)  If you're one of those people who don't like small plates because you need to shove a ridiculous amount of food in your mouth, this is your place.  The small plates all had very generous portions, especially for $5.    The name Rokerij comes from a set of cafes in Amsterdam, so this restaurant is a \"smokehouse\" (haha) that specializes in steaks and other grilled meats.  If you venture to the restaurant upstairs you are overwhelmed with the wonderful smell of grilled meats.  We had two small plates with beef tenderloin and they were both great.  Even the seafood dishes were very good - scallops, crab, shrimp, ceviche (though it was not a traditional ceviche and was a little sweet).  There were two things not to like.  1- The couple sucking face behind us on the couch.  I don't understand why grown adults have to act like teenagers in restaurants.   2- The roach that was crawling across the bar that my husband had to kill.  To thier credit, the bartender was grateful and thanked my husband for \"looking out\"",

I give it \"four thumbs aight\".  I've had better steaks, but never in a cozier environment.  Their booths are ridiculously private and can be really romantic.  Until you stare across the way and see some baby boomers molesting each other under the table.  You can bring your own bottle here, but their corking fee was $25 or $30 which made me really kinda laugh to myself, but not out loud because i didn't want to disturb the mood of the evening or the piranhas in table 4.    So, my $10 tip-top Malbec brought back from the actual country of Argentina via me and a large airliner (vino is amazingly good and cheap there), was now $40.  Whetever.  I just expected myself to be in LOOOVE with the food which was not the case.  However.  Their basement bar is pretty much the most unique place to drink in the Valley.  Its focused around a wood burning fire and this is precisely where you go to get a strong cocktail or a deep red wine.  If you can snag the fire-front seating you will want to park it right there all night.  Man, when they used to allow smoking down here, it was like being in the Loyal Order of Water Buffaloes Lodge.  Too bad.  Another case of the gubments saving us from ourselves.",

I highly recommend going there for happy hour in the wine cellar like bar. Caution: be careful when you are trotting down the stairs, they are steep. Totally worth the risk though.  Once downstairs you are immediately greeted by the lovely fireplace as well as the lovely music and delightful smell that fills the air. During happy hour, all small plates are $5, which gives you the perfect opportunity to eat your way through various dishes.  The drinks are also lovely, and the wine list is superb. I highly recommend the brie toasts and  chile relleno. All dishes are full of flavor with a nice little kick to awaken the senses. Aside from happy hour, the brunch menu coupled with mimosas or bloody marys is the perfect hangover cure.  Ambiance: A Service: A Price: B+ Food: A+",

The entertainment lawyer from LA turned waiter 4 months previous seemed quite pleasant and pleased to be in his new role and will only become more refined and astute. Just don't bring up Guns N Roses around him...  (Throughout we were attended to by other friendly staff who seemed to get along well with each other, carrying on light banter within ear shot.)  A gentle reminder to all establishments as we enter the \"warm\" season, please keep a vigilant eye on our water glasses. Sometimes even 30 seconds of ice only at the bottom of a glass can cause mild anxiety.  There were 5 different, occasionally overlapping menus (Rokerji's own lunch, breakfast, dinner; Dick's Hideaway; Richardsons) on the table, as well as colorful chalkboards on the walls full of specials. Choice overload.  We settled into a nice, earthy Firestone cab for me, bellini cocktail for my love, homemade lemonaid for teen daughter, and tea for mother-in-law, followed by calamari and tomato bruschetta for pre meal. All eliciting satisfying, \"Mmmm's!\" from a family not known for the gift of describing presentations and flavors in poetic, food critic terms.  Main courses were blackened Mahi w/ beets and trout w/ green beans (2 separate specials from the board) Pasta Heidi, chicken,beef,shrimp enchiladas with green sauce. we all shared, compared and enjoyed. 3 of the 4 dishes are on the spicey good side.. The trout was purposely tame for wife's mother.  Passed up dessert because someone in the party was jonesing for Costco's strawberry swirl and I was set on buying one of those propane tanks with a gauge (refer to pre-Mother's day grilling malfunction); my reward for pulling off - for the first time in a few years - a successful Mother's Day outing.  Thanks, Rokerij. Hope to see you again soon.",

Hell, it took me 5 tries typing the name in the search box to find it on here!  Every time we've gone, we've eaten downstairs in the bar-area.  The crowd is a little more lively.  It's also closer to the alcohol.  As you're walking down it feels like you're in a castle -- everything is stone.  When you enter there's a roaring fire with a few arm chairs around it.  You can eat at the bar, tables, the couch.. the floor I suppose?  Plenty of seating (not JUST a bar)  It's a little like being in a ski lodge.  Anyway.. very cool atmosphere.  I've heard mixed reviews from friends about their entree dishes.  They're a bit expensive.  We usually order a bunch of tapas dishes and share.  The last time we went we had four or five tapas and a bottle of wine.  We spent $60 or so with tip for the three of us and all left with a full stomach and a little hammered.  Great way to start the evening.",

    "text": "Not knowing where to go for dinner nor anything about this place, a friend suggested The Rokerij to my boyfriend and I.  It was getting late and I just wanted somewhere new to go for my birthday and, wow, was I happy with the decision.  Having not made a reservation and no tables available, there were three seats at the bar so we happily sat there.  Great wine selection and beer on draft, we ordered the roasted garlic appetizer and chose our drinks and looked over the menu.  Received our drinks and placed our entree orders, right about then the hostess approached to say they had a table for us.  The bartenders had no problem keeping our tab and coming out to serve us.  What great ambiance with the music, lighting, huge couch-like booths, and the grill and prep area behind the bar.  We received our appetizer about 10 minutes later and was it good.  Salads came in good time and we all ordered the Rokerij with iceberg, fresh bacon crumbles, tomatoes, onion, gorgonzola crumbles and dressing, tasty and crisp.  Round two on drinks and a few minutes later the entrees came out.  There was also a french loaf and butter brought out.  All were very hot and smelled amazing.  Our dining companion ordered the burger cooked to liking with bacon and three sauces.  My boyfriend ordered the beef and reef with bacon wrapped jumbo shrimp, crab stuffed enchiladas with red mole, and delicious mashed potatoes.  He almost ate everything but the potatoes!  I ordered the three fish special with mahi mahi in a red sauce, catfish in a roasted salsa, two jumbo shrimp with two amazing sauces (favoring the green chili cheese) a roasted red pepper potato stuffed poblano, and broccolini.    No dessert, no way!  Too much good food.  Perfect place to go for special occasion or anytime.  Service was great and friendly on our visit and I would love to go again real soon, for lunch or dinner.  Or maybe just a glass of wine in the basement.",

He acted like he had a hard night and was unwilling to suggest a beer, so I am sure he spit in my draft...Anyhoo, does not matter as I will not return.",

My husband had an empty glass during his entire meal. When I tried to order another (he was in the restroom), the bartender said he was \"pacing him\" since he had a martini. My food was good, but my husband's was burnt. Bill was over $100, still tipped over 20%... But I may never go back.  Such a sh@t experience.  Really bummed. And I've worked in the service industry since I was 14. I'm 42 now. Takes a lot for me to do this, and I hate doing it.",

    "text": "First off, this place is great, so please stay away, seating is limited . . .   This is probably one of my favorite places in Phoenix.  The ambiance is incredible, from the stairs leading down to the lighting, and incredibly effective use of space offering everything from several booths, bar seating, a dining couch, and comfortable seats in front of the fire place.  The lighting is absolutely perfect and the music in the back ground is just right.  You can hear it when you want, but not so overpowering that it keeps normal conversations from happening.  Never had a bad experience here!  Well, there was one time, but that was only because it was completely full and we ended up eating at the bar at Richardson's and it was pretty incredible too!  Staff is always friendly, and knowledgeable.  Seriously, just stay away, its already way to popular, you really will like it, so just stay away . . . for us, please!  We ordered the 2015 Caymus Cab, and drank it at our dining couch.  Yes, it's ours, stay off . . .  Our server was perfect, and we never wanted for anything.  The wine was great, and we ordered the seared scallops, which we have ordered before, and will order again.  They are really good.  A tad pricey?  Sure . . . stay away then!  Oh, almost forgot!  I did think one of the seared scallops was really burnt when they arrived.  Concerned I was.  Until I ate it, and realized it was still great even though it looked burnt, it really wasn't, just heavily seared, and still very succulent.  Let me tell you how much we love this place, both my wonderful GF and I.  We had just gone to Little Cleo's for the first time.  It was my birthday, and I know how much my GF loves oyster's so I wanted to go there to celebrate.  Our experience was extremely disappointing at Cleo's, but that is another review.  We both felt deflated, a bit disappointed, very un-celebratory in spirit, and honestly had just kind of wanted to go home.  I mean really BLAH!!!  Sucked too, because it was my birthday . . .   However, we decided to stop by the Rokerij instead, since it was on the way home, and if nothing else, we both wanted to find out if our experience at Cleo's was really what was bringing us down or not.  Valet took our car, and we walked over the the door at the top of the stairs.  I held it for my dearest, and we descended.  I know I began to feel better immediately.  Especially when I saw that we wouldn't have to evict anyone from our dining couch!  Our evening completely turned around.  We left there feeling wonderful.  So yeah . . . seriously, stay away, it's our magical place  ;-)  GG1314  shoo!",

I seriously could've ordered every single item and have been in love with the dish.  Absolutely everything sounded phenomenal, so to decide which 2 dishes to get was a feat, but it was a feat worth dueling for.  We got the Eggs Benedict Jalapeno (with pork loin) and the Carne Adovado and Eggs.  Oh. My. God.  The eggs benedict were outstanding, but the carne adoovado is something out of this world from a long, slow cooked Mexican bbq - so smokey, saucy and delicious!!  We were fighting over who got the last bites.    And what's even better is that brunch comes with drink specials!  I had the mimosa ($6) which was an incredibly generous pour (and oh so refreshing with the spicy food), and my boyfriend had a bloody mary with was spicy and delicious!  Plus a big shout out for the service!!  The place was packed, but our server was Luis provided us with incredibly attentive service.  He was so wonderful about giving us great details about the food and specials, all with a smile on his face.  I will 100% will be back here to indulge in more tasty brunch treats for sure!!",

We really liked the speakeasy atmosphere that whisks you away from reality, and makes you feel like you're no longer in Phoenix.  It was dark, but not so dark you need a torch to read the menu, and classy, but not so classy that it bleeds pretentiousness.   The selection small dishes on happy hour made it fun- I need to return just to try every one!  For our entree we had the New Mexico platter that was mouthwatering, and like the small plates, I need to return just to try everything else on the menu...We'll be back without a doubt.  Happy hour is 3-6pm with reverse being 9pm-close at the time of this review.",

For that price please make the sauce in house. Steak tartare was delicious, but for $31 it had better be.    Son ordered the chicken pasta which was seasoned well, but the noodles and chicken were in need to be thrown a life preserver. They were definitely drowning in their sauce.    Wife ordered the seafood linguine at $32, which had 2 size 21-25 shrimp and the 2 scallops were not even u-15.  To top it off the shrimp was sooooo over cooked she couldn't even cut it with a knife. They put the burnt side of the shrimp and scallop facing down so you couldn't see how over cooked it was.   I ordered the mahi mahi, which I should have taken a picture of. The broccoli side was much bigger portion than the fish. $44 for at most a 6 oz portion.    Needless to say I am truly disappointed,  I had food here before and was impressed.    Oh well, if anything the service was good.",

Leather seating, candles everywhere and just a very cool ambience. We had the salmon bites as a starter, and then shared the Chilean Seabass with A sweet potato stuffed jalapeno and broccoli.

Calamari was lightly breaded and tender and delicious as usual but a pretty small portion for the price. Parpadelle pasta for $32 was a complete joke for the portion size and there is little tiny pieces of shredded \"duck\" that would equate to about tablespoon of meat. It was also very salty. Been coming for about 2 years, we have been here for our Anniversary and literally nothing was special this time, the server didn't even seem to care. Spent over $100 and felt like it wasn't even worth half of that. Unfortunately we probably won't be coming back and will be finding a new place for our special outings.",

I felt like I was time traveling. They have the football game on during Sundays, which is a pleasant change of pace from the sports bars. Their happy hour menu is well priced.   I eat vegan and I'm fully aware that I'm kind of annoying when I go out so I usually prepare. I asked for recommendations and asked if maybe I could make a meal out of sides or something. She suggested a potato. They unfortunately burnt the potato and told me that I could not have a potato. She suggested calamari - haha. I ended up paying $18 for plain noodles and grilled veggies. Not a problem at all, but I would make sure that you eat ahead and save yourself the hassle. I wish they'd have just one veggie friendly dish.    My friend got a lemonade and she kept refilling it. Turns out, they charge $3 per lemonade. I found it odd that it wasn't explained that its not free refills. Not a problem but when you have 4 lemonades - that just became a $12 drink to supplement the $12 cocktail.   She also didn't put the burger in on happy hour - so make sure to check your receipts.",

Not biggie if you have a big enough group. There were 15 of us and we blew way past that amount. And the dining room is quite enough to have a conversation with the people around you. It's still a big size so you'll have to get up if you want to speak to anyone on the other side of the room. The food and service was fantastic. Which goes without saying. There are plenty of other reviews that cover that. But I promise you that you won't have a bad meal.",

Italy )  but the pizza was for the four year old.    My meal was this amazing smoked pork dish with beans and rice.  It hit the spot. . .a unique and mildly spicey dish.  I so enjoyed it, I really want to go back and try the brunch everyone is talking about. . . sounds AMAZING  the place itself is odd - You can go down in the basement, you can go outside. . its almost as if there are three restaurant areas together.  We had this awesome booth seat next to a fireplace. It was quant and awesome.    My brother got three enchiladas. . and man were they tasty.  Plus a lot of food for the amount (entrees cost around 14-18 bucks)  I would highly recommend this place - and it is a great thing to try when your in Phoenix area and want a taste of new mexico-arizona - etc  note:  there are more expensive fish and meat dishes., which cost almost twice as much.",

My friend and I came in for Sunday brunch and was helped by Robert at the bar. We ordered two of the breakfast specials and they came out just as we ordered. The service Robert provided us was the best I've seen--he was attentive, friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu.   The ambiance of the restaurant is also special!

The food is a bit pricey (spent $83 the other day for 2 adults and a child). Despite this, I really love the New Mexican cuisine and flavors, although more often than not, the food is a little too spicy for me.   My favorites are their bacon wrapped shrimp and roasted garlic plate. Fair warning that the menu is very similar to Richardsons. The other day, I ordered the bacon wrapped shrimp (5 for $16) and thought it was the dinner. The server told me I was confusing it with Richardson's and that at Rokerij, it was an app.   Parking is valet, of course, which is a little annoying but standard in central Phoenix.",

Both of use used the restroom (separately so one of us were there the entire time) and were still waiting...  Another employee asked us if we needed help, we said we thought we were being helped, but no one came back. She said she would help us, the phone rang, she answered the phone and kept us waiting several more minutes.  With no end in sight and no one addressing us, we walked out and went next door to Richardson's where we were seated immediately.  Won't be back to either restaurant based on our experience at Rokerij and the not so great food at Richardson's.   Not sure what all the rave is about but we will never know.

    "text": "I have to say I was very disappointed with this place, considering the level of reviews it's received, the location nearby lots of other great spots, and just the look, feel and menu.  The first problem was before we even went.  I had tried to call and make a reservation, but I couldn't hear the person who answered the phone at all - it was super crackly and cutting out with only tiny bits and pieces coming through.  I tried calling a few times with the same result.  So I had to just give up and go when we were ready to eat and hope we could get a seat in a decent amount of time.  When we got there, though, they said they could seat us, but we'd have to leave in one hour for another reservation (wonder how they got theirs!).  We thought an hour should be plenty, so went ahead.  But then we proceeded to sit there for about 25 minutes before anyone even acknowledged us at all - so there went almost half our time, despite 4 servers just kind of slowly wandering around and standing around.  I tried hard to get their attention to no avail until I finally got up and asked.  Our server just made a lame excuse.  The problems just continued from there, taking forever to get our appetizer, a bad drink for my wife, more crappy, inattentive service, and finally to top it off - bad food too!!  I was pretty shocked actually.  But both of our dishes were bad.  My wife got a fish special that was super bland, and I got a steak that was sitting on top of a soggy piece of bread, swimming in a pool of watery sauce that was spilling off the plate as the server so carefully tried to set it down in front of me.  It kind of seemed to us that maybe this place used to be good, or is maybe good on other nights or something, but this was a Friday night and for everything to be bad, from start to finish like that just seems pretty suspect.  As if the whole regular staff, including the chefs were out on vacation or something.  I am giving it the benefit of the doubt and not rating it more harshly because there was really good atmosphere and decor, the server was friendly when she was there, and at least parts of the food were good - enough to think maybe it really was just a horribly off night.  I'm not sure if we'd go back, though, considering the price - huge waste of $$ and way overrated if this is the norm!",

These stool were so tightly packed together that it was difficult to use and without back support they were not comfortable for long. The staff was very attentive upon our arrival but once they discovered that we were waiting for a fourth to join us it was impossible to get the servers attention again with any regularity.  In order to take advantage of the happy hour prices (which I recommend as the menu is pricey) food was ordered prior to the last member arriving.  The appetizer portions were generous. The party tried the prime rib sliders which were tasty although a little too fatty for their liking.  The meatball skewers were next. The meatball was a little dry but it was covered in a tomato sauce that had some good spiciness. It was awesome.  Also tried the chicken lettuce wraps.  They were a bit disappointing in so much as the chicken used was a cold chicken salad style instead of a warmed chicken.  Overall I wouldn't mind giving this place another chance to be able to sample some of the dinner and salad items.  But as others state...you better make a reservation.",

I highly suggest at least a 12 hour separation from all loved ones if you plan on them wanting to hug you ever again...   This meal is well worth the awkward night following, in fact I think I want some again tomorrow...",

Truly the best duck I have ever had. We came for the happy hour which by the way is awesome but we couldn't resist venturing into the regular menu when there were such interesting options.  Mike and Brent are great too and very knowledgable! Fabulous experience.",

    "text": "Solid joint, intimate, woody.  My date and I got a great table in the corner by the private room, which was nice because the main area was pretty loud on that Saturday night.       On the downside, a large party of drunks stumbled through to the private room near the end of the date.  They needed an asskicking, but perhaps they were regulars and the management let it slide.  It happens.      We had the brie toasts, a perfect little appetizer.  I had the pork tender-loin, which comes out skewer style, perfectly done with a mint jam garnish.  The sweet potato stuffed chili pepper seems to be a regular side dish there.  It was a new one for me, sweet and fiery, it was great!  Creme brulee for desert was top notch, smothered in berries.             I would have liked to spend more time there, so I'll definitely be back for another round some day.",

    "text": "For my 2nd birthday dinner I chose the Rokerij. My hubby & I met my parents there at 6:30pm this past Sunday. I was kinda bummed we didn't eat down stairs but the main dinning room was very cool so I wasn't too disappointed. Even though we had reservations, we had to wait about 15 minutes for a table. Once seated, we had a big, comfy booth with throw pillows, next to the fire place. & I know some people don't care for it but I loved the dim lighting!   For starters we ordered the beef tenderloin toasts & calamari. The calamari was good but I didn't like the dipping sauce. It was too sweet, I prefer cocktail sauce. I'm pretty sure I said the beef toasts, not brie, but she brought out the brie. Still delicious but would have loved to try it with the beef. I would have said something but the service was so slow & our server disappeared for 10-20 minutes at a time. She seemed...high...on life maybe? Hmmm...   Any way, for our entrees: my mom ordered the chimayo chicken (Richardson's menu), my dad the prime rib (Rokerij menu), my hubby the garlic shrimp pasta (Richardson's menu) & I ordered one of the specials-a trio of fish: salmon, mahi mahi & swordfish. For sides: 2 meals came with a salad, 3 meals came with their famous green chile potato, 2 meals opted for asparagus & 1 opted for zucchini. My mom did not like her chicken at all but loved the salad & asparagus that came with. My dad liked how rare his steak was cooked but said the horseradish sauce on top ruined the taste for him, loved his zucchini though. My hubby loved his garlic shrimp pasta & salad. I loved my trio of fish & asparagus, so yummy! Those of us who got the GCP did not really care for it, we must be a group of wimps because we found it to be too spicy. Very creative side dish though!   Our total came to about $185, not including tip. We did have about 5-6 cocktails, plus 2 apps & 4 entrees. So I guess it wasn't too bad price-wise but my dad thought it was way too expensive. Maybe because he was footing the bill? Well, I think my hubs & I will come back for happy hour perhaps & I really want to check out the down stairs!",

The hostess is always very sweet and they are super accomodating. Downstairs is a very cool bar and the dining area and bar upstairs have a real flair!  First, you must have a bloody mary. Must. Have. A. Bloody. Mary. They are a delicious treat of spicy and strong and make my mouth water. Only my boozing grandma makes better!  The margaritas are tasty and I love their selection of tequila.  Second, the food is outstanding. They provide a partial menu from the old Richardson's and everything is delicous. They have an outstanding happy hour during the week and a delicious brunch on weekends. I always get the shrimp pasta. It is full of shrimp and has the yummiest pasta and cream sauce EVER!  Another good choice is the famous GCP. Seriously, mind blowing!  Parking is a little tricky but well worth it!",

Although this spot is awesome at any time of the year, I think when the weather turns cooler, this is like a trip to your fantasy of an Olde English Public House.  There is an upstairs restaurant and a downstairs cellar bar. I'll be focusing on the Cellar bar.  Downstairs is amazing. There are/were only a couple bars in PHX that I can think of that were underground and this is one of them. It's swanky, candle-lit, and it has some of the best happy hour specials I've ever experienced. Their \"small plate's\" are truly some of the finest creations I've ever had for the price.  I would recommend trying them all out eventually, but start with one or two. For $5 during happy hour, they can't be beat.  As for the drinks, there are two times where you can seriously get your money's worth.  On Sunday, Monday and Tuesday all bottles of wine are 1/2 price.  And they have some excellent wines. The other time is regular happy hour all week from 3-6.  For me, it's all about going on a Sun, Mon or Tues during HH! 1/2 of bottles of wine, cocktail specials AND $5 small plates. I'll call it budget-swank. Excellent experience for not too much money./Art",

    "text": "We asked our concierge to recommend a place we could go that had pretty good food, didn't have to get too dressed up but still had an interesting atmosphere. She suggested Rokerij and I wasn't sure, but we figured we'd give it a try.   Driving along the long strip of road with little businesses surrounding the restaurant, I was a little nervous pulling into the parking lot - it looked like a stuffy log cabin, BUT there was some hope - the parking lot was pretty full.   We walked in and the place had character! Menu items were written in chalk along the walls and it seemed like a comfy cabin-like, but kind of hip at the same time restaurant. We were told there was some seating downstairs. Downstairs? Who knew? It was great! We had a corner booth (plush, high back) facing the bar and the bar set up was great! All the liquor was neatly laid out, clean and they seemed to have everything. And they had a couple of tv screens and a fireplace (although not exactly needed in Phoenix) on this floor.   THE FOOD WAS FAB! AND the prices, were NOT even as high as what you find in L.A. at all for what you get!   Hubby got the PRIME RIB with broccolini and mashed potatoes. What came out was a BEAST ON A PLATE. HUGE serving of meat prepared how ordered - medium rare. Mashed potatoes in its own little crockpot - STEAMING goodness. All that for $29! That's a pretty darn good deal for the amount of meat and with sides.   I got the Rokerij Steak which was topped with crab (THE REAL STUFF) and jalapeno hollandaise (couldn't taste the jalapeno though). I ordered the grilled beets and GCP (green chile potato) as my sides. The GCP was unique but wasn't for my tastebuds. Beets were great and again, just a hearty portion for $36 - they didn't scrimp on the crab.   We also got appetizers - bacon wrapped scallops and a turkey chile relleno. Scallops were FAT, cooked well and flavorful (of course it helps with the bacon). Chile relleno with turkey? Um AMAZING. I have NEVER had turkey that moist before and so cheesy and it was laid across four different sauces - hollandaise to a tomatillo like sauce.   Our bartender/waiter was so nice and attentive and he was just great.   We will DEFINITELY go back again as there are a TON of unique and interesting menu items. And NEXT TIME I AM BRINGING my camera!",

    "text": "If ever there was a restaurant I could dream of picking up and taking with me to whatever city I end up living it would be Rockerji.  I have such a special spot for this establishment, from their New Zealand Sauv. Blanc list to their green chili potato side Rockerji know's what's up.  As I've frequented this restaurant more times than I can keep track of, I hadn't sat down to really appreciate them in the form of a Yelp review.  I owe you one, Rockerji.  My last visit to Rockerji, and I'm assuming this will be my last for quite sometime since I'm moving across the country next week, was nothing short of incredible.  It was a celebratory meal honoring a job offer so of course drinks were in order.  We started out with glasses of the crisp and ever so light White Haven Sauvaignon Blanc as well as the Ahi Tuna appetizer.  Now you should be warned, all the plates at Rockerji have a bit of a kick...a spicy, not overboard flavor punch.  The crew I was with opted on a barbeque pizza for the table and 3 plates served \"family style\".  It's almost sinful to not order the bacon-wrapped scallops and the beef tenderloin brie toasts, no but really - you'll be repenting for days.   We also had the chicken taco's which are spicier than the average person can handle (eater's beware).  For dessert we enjoyed the flourless cake which could serve a family of 8, I promise.  The chocolate was perfect consistency and is paired ever so nicely with a vanilla bean ice cream.  Great, intimate date spot or laid-back foodie haven.",

Our waiter, Clark was ON IT all night! He was a great waiter and went above and beyond!   The food was pretty decent. I ordered the Rokerij burger medium well, but it came out on the medium/medium rare tip...But I dealt and ate it. I had a side of the roasted beets which were pretty fantastic.

We were happy to learn that it was half priced wine bottles (Sundays and Mondays), so naturally we had 4 bottles on a Monday night :)    We had 3 small plates to start the meal - the calamari, quesadillas and ceviche.  All were very good.  I could eat the quesadillas all day every day!  The ceviche has an interesting flavor, almost like cinnamon.  It wasn't my favorite ceviche in town, but I did enjoy it.    Everyone ordered something different.  Skewers, New Mexican Platter, Swordfish Special, Halibut Special, Surf & turf, Steak Skewers, Chicken Skewers, and I can't remember the last meal.  Everyone was very happy with their food. We did have a small hiccup with the chicken on the skewers not being totally done, but our server was very apologetic and offered to bring back some properly cooked chicken.  But he was already full so he declined.  They took the whole skewer meal off the bill without us asking or even putting up a fuss about it. I loved the surf & turf, perfectly cooked and the shrimp was wrapped in bacon - yum!  We also had a couple of desserts - the flourless chocolate cake, which was a delicious fudge cake that we devoured ... and the creme brulee, which they brought with a lit candle for the birthdays we were celebrating.  My husband prefers his creme brulee custard a little more firm, but i thought it was perfect!  So I ate most of it  :)  I think our server was new because he seemed to have a shadow most of the evening.  But he did a great job, was very personable, and if I was smart enough to find out his name, I would love to sit in his section again.  They never seem to hurt for business, yet they still manage to make you feel like they want you to come back again and again!  And I will!  I love this restaurant - it's definitely a family favorite!",

(please don't ever make me do that again) I have a new crush. (restaurants without windows)  Rokerij is fast becoming a new favorite spot of mine. I went out on a limb and ordered the NY Steak, medium rare. It was fantastic. Not a huge fan of the green chilie twice baked potato thing but that's more of a personal taste issue. We all shared the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp and Calamari as appetizers. Both delicious; the sauce served with the Calamari tastes distinctively like Pei-Wei's sweet and sour, though that's not a bad thing. Desert was \"Death by Chocolate\". I had one bite. One bite was enough. Heavy and rich like fudge...not my thing.  All in all a great dining experience. I will be back. Many....many times. They also happen to serve the full Richardson's menu, just the way I remember it.

I went again for happy hour on a Friday, it is dangerous that this place is so close to my work. This time we had to sit at the bar upstairs because the one downstairs was packed. I really love the open kitchen. You can watch them prepare all of your food right there in front of you. Our bartender was awesome, joked around with us, talked wine with my friend who worked at vineyard for years, and gave us some great recommendations for Riojas that he thought we would enjoy. I love service like this, that is why I will keep coming back, people who genuinely like their guests and enjoy their jobs. The awesome food at $5 a plate doesn't hurt either:)",

I first discovered this lil gem barhopping with a friend of mine and was completely in awe of the whole ambiance of the place.  The entrance is a narrow stone stairway that leads down to a small bar area with a couple of booths and seats in front of a fireplace.  Completely underground and secluded from the chaotic world above.  We had a drink and went on our way to Richardson's next door which was also amazing, but that's a whole other review.  My second experience was when my best friend and I planned our birthday dinner with our guys.  She made our reservations and requested one of the booths, which we were accomodated with.  Our server was great, she was friendly and very attentive.  We ordered chicken skewers as our appetizer, I had the chicken schnitzel, my best friend had the pork adobada, and the guys both ordered the prime rib.  All were delicious!  The prime ribs were huge!  We had a great time.  It's a quiet lil hole in the wall bar/restaurant.  Great for catching up with a friend over drinks or a date night!  I can't wait to go again!",

I have to say that this is one of my new favorite HH spots! I went on a Tuesday night and they have half off bottles of wine, all night. Good thing since I needed something to wash down the delectable bacon wrapped scallops.   The small plates deals during HH are great and such a great departure from the usual HH bites... I don't know about you but I'm tired of fried things and bruschetta. How much bruschetta can Phoenix handle?! Yet, I digress. The small plates, from $9 to $5 a plate... such a good deal. We had the scallops I mentioned, really good scallops- worth the regular price of $9. We also had the Beef Tenderloin/Brie toasts, a little heavy on the brie, but the barkeep raved that they were the best thing he's ever had... (Maybe he should try Postino's toast?) Stuffed mushrooms were good, the taco combo plate- Great Mexico City style tacos, and I'm a huge critic of Mexican food and these were actually very good. Except 1, 1 was a wee bit too spicy for me. And I LOVE spicy. Maybe it was the wine bringing out the tingling on my tongue? We also got the oysters rokerij, similar to Green Mussels you would get at a sushi place... Very yummy.   There were 3 in our party and we walked out of the place full and pleasantly toasty for $60 total- this isn't your Chili's HH but I'm more than willing to spend $20 for the atmosphere, the drink, and the food. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "I love this place and take all my out of town visitors here for a taste of the Southwest.  The only downside to it being a small place is that it can get very busy and can mean a long wait if you don't reserve a table.  I love that the bar seats are right in front of the open kitchen so you can watch the chefs do their thing with all of those enchiladas and carne dishes.  Their smoked turkey enchiladas are good but if you like spice, go for the rellenos.  Those are some hot roasted green chiles and I love the beef filling and the duck option.  Goes great with a glass of Stella on draught.  Very dark swanky chocolate brown interior with a fireplace and wine bottle walls.",

One of my fave things -- when the economy was melting down, they had a \"stimulus meal\" that included two salads, two side dishes, and one entree -- for LESS than the price of the regular entree price on the menu.    Gotta love a place that does amazing, tasty food and helps the customer out.  One warning:  don't gobble too many of the apps as the meals are big and you'll get filled up.  But damn, the apps are pretty amazing.  Or maybe just make a dinner out of them?",

    "text": "I have been here over 5 times and every time I go I wonder why I went back.  I really want to like this place but they have given me no reason to, unfortunate, I know.  I am actually shocked they have such a good rating on yelp.  First of all, one main problem they have is that there is no place to wait. There is no real hostess stand, so you must stand there awkwardly waiting for your table to be ready.  You are always in the way and the staff is not shy about letting you know that.  Thinkng about it, there are 4 seats by the fireplace, but you are again, awkwardly squished in between 4 booths and simply in the way.   On at least four of the visits we made reservations at least a week in advance.  Everytime our table is not ready.  The shortest amount of time we waited was 30 minutes- WITH a reservation.  The worst time we waited almost 2 hours on a weeknight.  The \"manager\" offered us a round of drinks when we told him we were going to leave and took our order.  When dinner was over and the bill finally came my glass of wine was on the bill.  I questioned him about it and he said that since my order was more expensive than the others in the group I would have to pay for it.  I don't think he expected me, a 25 year old female, to fight him on it but I did.  I reminded him that he said round of drinks without a specification of type.  If there was a price limit I would have made a different choice.  After looking at me like he wanted to fight me some more he walked away and brought back a revised bill.  Without saying a word then disappearing turns out he gave a credit to the bill for the price of a beer.  REALLY? Great customer service. The price difference was only $1.50. He shouldn't be considered a manager.    The next time we were there, while still enjoying our cocktails and drinks, a new manager asked us if they could relocate us to the patio very abruptly.  Mind you the place was almost empty and it was about 10:30pm.  They claimed a new party was coming in and they needed our table.  So, feeling kicked out we reluctantly said yes and he said they would set us up by a heater (it was December) and send over a complimentary bottle of wine.  We got outside, the booth was cement and the heater was out of propane. We were freezing and then a waiter came over for drink orders.  We were all so confused we explained the situation and then he disappeared never to come back.  We promptly finished our drinks from dinner and opted to leave in lieu of freezing while we waited for that complementary bottle of wine to appear.  My real issue is with the food.  I like my meat cooked medium well, I am weird about the temperature of my meat because I have gotten sick before.  Any time I order my burgers medium well they come out medium or medium rare.  It is so frustrating so I stopped ordering beef there altogether.    On a whim, I went here on a Saturday afternoon with my boyfriend.  I knew better than to order meat, so I opted for enchiladas, but my boyfriend chose a burger.  The place was empty and there were only 5 other people there so I figured he was safe and I didn't say anything.  He ordered his burger medium rare (he typically enjoys red meat very red and isn't picky like me), big mistake.  After 30 minutes of waiting our food came.  He cut into his burger where it was revealed to be completely raw.  I mean RAW.  Not even cooked rare, this thing was still mooing, even he was grossed out.  We called over the waiter and explained the issue, he said they would throw it back on the grill because making a new one would take too long.  Ummm ok, strike one.  The kitchen is open to the restaurant and the waiter took the burger to the chef and the chef yelled, that's medium rare, what the hell is the problem? We saw the whole thing.  He threw, literally threw, the burger on the grill and then just stared at us.  Strike two.  The waiter came back and said that's what the chef considers medium rare.  We told him it was ice cold in the middle and if my boyfriend would have eaten it he would have gotten ill. He said oh no, that wouldn't make him sick, it's very good quality. Uhhh strike three.  Stunned, I said if that burger was medium rare, tell the chef he wants it medium well (hoping it would then be medium rare).  When it arrived, it was charred so badly you could barely cut into it, clearly the chef was making a statement, strike four.  The waiter noticed that the burger was now inedible and didn't say anything, just cleared our plates and brought over the check.  No apologies, no discounts, no comped meal, nothing. Strike 5, they forfeited the game.    After we left, I decided I would never go back.  I was literally in shock as to what just happened.  My advice is to steer clear of this place, the food, even the New Mexican specialties, are mediocre at best.  I can't think of anything that would make me want to go back.  Sorry to burst any bubbles out there.",

The food stole the show for sure.  They don't take reservations less than 4  so it's a  battle if you show up a one on one sesh especially for the trad date type gig.  Anywho we got the scallops wrapped in bacon and only thing to say is that it was DELISH!!!  There were 4 types of dipping sauce acting as a base almost slathering the entire dish but they were overpowering.  We also split the lamb and I was teetering about the dish.  The sides were delish:  Roasted beets and some type of Jalapeno mashed taters thing which was RADTASTIC!  The Lamb was good but something was missing along the lines of seasoning.  Overall wonderful dish.  We finished up with a creme brulee which definitely hit the spot for the evening.  Had a great time and really loved checking out Richardsons as well!!!  Totally will be back!!!",

    "text": "Let me preface this by saying this used to be my favorite restaurant in PHX... This experience has changed that...  I made a reservation for 11 5 days before the dinner at 730 pm on a Sat..  after arriving promptly at 730 we were forced to wait 20 minutesonly to be sat at 2 separate booths...  Completetly defeating the purpose of a group dining experience..  Now the bad part...  For dinner I ordered off the special menu a wild boar bacon wrapped bone in beef tenderloin cooked rare..  I received a baconless well done hunk of meat...  I pointed this out to the waitress she took the meal hoping to have it prepared correctly..  a few minutes later the manager approached the table and informed me they were out of the bacon ( one would think they would know that before the meal was prepared and attempted to slide this past the diner). I was offered a replacement meal , but declined and decided to go with the soup.... This prompted the manager to inform me it was a spicy dish to which I accepted and said it was fine, he proceeded to inform me of the heat of the dish 2 more times both times I assured him this was fine leading him to question my order again at which time I was in disbelief and asked if there is some reason he doesn't want me to  have the dish..   this was enough to finally agree to let me place the order the soup came and was excellent and spicy.   I managed to persevere through the heat and eat the whole bowl ( I enjoy spicy food).  This ruined the whole experience for me ..  luckily everyone else's meals were enjoyable its just disappointing being treated like that at a place I thought so highly of and do everythingin my power to get people I care about to do it....

    "text": "Let me first start off by saying I work in the hospitality industry, operating restaurants for a living and I have read numerous reviews about his place.  The reviews had gotten me very excited about trying this establishment but unfortunately I do not think I will ever return to this restaurant or recommended it any of my 1000s guest.  To be honest it has nothing to do with the cuisine but everything to do with the service I received. I am a firm believer that cuisine speaks for itself but if the service is weak then it really makes the entire experience undesirable.  I work long days and do not always know when I am going to make it out for dinner so my g/f and I wanted to head over without a reservations (which I knew can cause problems).  We walked in noticing it was full and stopped by the greeter stand to wait to speak to the manager/greeter.  I am familiar with opentable and noticed we probably wouldn't be able to get a table but just wanted to inquire how long it would be to wait for a bar seat.  As we are waiting an older woman approaches us and asks if we have a reservation.  I reply with \"No, unfortunately we don't\".  Her response (not joking at all)  \"YOU MUST BE DREAMING IF YOU THINK YOU CAN EAT HERE WITHOUT A RESERVATION\"!!  I couldn't believe it.... I asked if she thought a bar spot could possible open up?  Her response again was also EXTREMELY RUDE \"YOU'RE DREAMING\"!!  I honestly couldn't believe it.  I asked to speak to the manager and she replied with \"WHY?\"  At that point I was fed up. Turned around and walked out. I have had poor experiences before but never before have had I felt so disrespected before I could even sit down at the table.  I would say I would want a call from the management but it is obvious they don't really care how they treat their guest.  I am surprised they have stayed open as long as they have. I look forward to recommending one of the other 100 establishments I know to my many guest over the upcoming busy months.",

He was awesome and he spoiled me and Soraya rotten. :)  This is cute but small little place. As I was walking up, two different couples instantly said, I hope you have a reservation as they were walking away. Uhoh... this can't be good. I called Soraya who was in route to ask if she had made reservations.. hmm nope. Crap. So when she arrives, I sucker her into going downstairs since everyone that went down, came right back up. Lo and behold there were two seats at the bar. Hmm interesting that no one saw that lol. We hoisted ourselves up and was immediately greeted by Werner as well as the rest of the bar staff. We ordered our wine a bottle of the cupcake wine, which was delicious and it was half off seeing as it was Monday :). We also ordered the prime rib sliders, brie toasts, and the tacos. The people next to us had commented on how hot the tacos were and was wondering if we could handle the heat as they said they couldn't. Don't get me wrong, they were spicy, but I make things way spicier so I was use to it. Soraya well not so much lol.  The tacos, sliders, and brie toasts were so good, The prime rib was cooked perfectly and the au jus to dip it in was num yummy. We also ordered the flour-less chocolate cake that was more like a sinful fudge. Delicious. We even got to move over to the fire place to continue chatting it up and enjoy our wine and dessert.  I will definitely be back, especially if Werner is working. :)",

I had a dirty martini with amazing blue cheese stuffed olives, shaken violently, with that frothy layer of ice on top - outstanding.  Then I ordered up the enchiladas and tamales - which came with both red and green sauce.  Let me warn you the red sauce is NO JOKE! WHOA! Hot, but super yummy.  Everything was prepared perfectly and I could not be happier.  My date had the sliders and scallops - I don't think I have had a better prepared scallop.  The service is perfect, staff is happy, food is amazing and I will dine there again!",

    "text": "We enjoyed a phenomenal Christmas Eve dinner this year at Rokerij. We had a larger party (16) so we used the private room they have behind the bar. It was fantastic. Shannon and Paul were fantastic while we set this up and the night couldn't have been better. Tony did a great job with such a large group. Of course, the food is just crazy good.... The \"Rokerij\" side of the menu is traditional American fare while the \"Richardson's\" side of the menu is New Mexico-style Mexican food (WONDERFUL if you like spicy). Typical Rokerij, they also had about 10 specials (veal chops were great, salmon and grouper were perfect), plus everything ordered from the menu was wonderful (except the prime rib sliders were way over-cooked and bland). We highly recommend... Thanks Rokerij for a great night.",

First a word of warning, this place is dark...not dark like medieval, but dark like the lights are not working.  My grandparents had a bit of a time making their way through but the staff was very good about assisting and getting us a table near the door.      The bar downstairs is very cool, if you get there and can find somewhere to sit.  I was enjoying it so much the first time I ate there that I didn't want to take the elevator upstairs when it was time to be seated for dinner.  The menu is varied and full of varied salads, meats, and pastas and the appetizers are just as good if not the best part of the menu.  I am not a wine guy but those who were did their best to add several empty bottles to the collection in the wine racks on the walls.  They said that they enjoyed the selection and variety.  I enjoyed the selection of beer and tequilas.    Give it a shot, but wear your headlamp!",

We made a reservation for the downstairs cellar and when we got there our tables wasn't ready just yet so they set us up at a nice cozy fire pit and we ordered a round of drinks. Everything was delicious. Once we sat down at our table, our server, Ashley J. Told us all about the menu and we put our food orders in. The food came out quick and was so tasty. We had the #4 pizza, some burgers, and some skewers, and calamari. Everything I tasted was great! When we got out tab, they took care of all of our bride to be's drinks. They were very accommodating, Ashley was an amazing and fun server.  After we had left and moved on to our next place, I realized I lost my house key. I called rokerji to ask if they found any, and they asked the new table of people sitting in the table where we were to get up so they could look under the table. To me that is just such great customer service. Definitely recommend this place to all my friends. Nice small and cozy. I had a great time and j know everyone else in the party did too. Thanks Rokerji for everything!",

    "text": "What a disappointment. We began our late night (9:30) dinning experience here really happy with high expectations as the ambiance was wonderful and the recommendations were good. However, we left bitter and disappointed. My sister and I enjoyed two lovely \"small plates\" one was beef skewers and the other a shrimp bruschetta type dish. It was all down hill after that. Shortly after ordering our main courses we noticed a bug crawling on the top of our booth...yeah, it was a COCKROACH!!! I grabbed it in my napkin and crumpled it up and left in a side station area. We both were grossed out but were not going to make a huge fuss and have it ruin our meal. We're both flexible and understanding and didn't complain. But seeing that in a restaurant is really inexcusable and disgusting-and definitely dampers your appetite for their food. Where are his friends? Are they in the kitchen?! YUCK!!! We then waited 45 minutes for our food: an enchilada plate and a relleno plate. When they set down the steaming hot plates the food was cooked to nuclear levels because there  was a one inch crust around the plate and the beans were so dried out it was comical. Now mind you, these are $16 and $18 dollar plates of food. That is borderline fine dinning pricing and should come out looking as such. We promptly sent the food back and the manager came out and apologized which was appreciated. He stated that \"it was inexcusable the way the food came out (which our server didn't monitor) and that his cook is obviously more interested in cleaning and getting out of here, then preparing the food.\" They offered to remake the food but it was literally too late around 10:45 and we didn't want to wait. They then took the food off but left the other stuff on. The bill came out to around 42 dollars. Which seemed unreasonable after only having a beer, a cocktail, two appetizers and a totally ruined dinning experience. We didn't mention the cockroach or the fact that it was my 30th birthday to the manager but it boils down to this: after that kind of experience he could of saved our business by comping the meal. The fact that we had TWO ruined entrees and walked out of their still hungry AND paying 40 dollars is bullshit. There are too many other quality options in this town with exceptional service. I wont ever go back to Rokerij.",

    "text": "I have been to Rokerij three times. The first was for a work related lunch - I enjoyed the small plate selection and was impressed by the ambiance.   I enjoyed it enough to take my BF back there for a romantic dinner. It took us a while to actually make it there because they wouldn't take reservations for less than a party of 4 - so we ended up going for an early dinner. It was delicious and the service was great.   BF enjoyed it enough that when I inquired as to what how he would like to celebrate his thirtieth birthday he selected Rokerij.   This is where disappointment sets in. I hate to be tough on the place but . . . the food was good, the ambiance good - but. . .   I made reservations for 4 two weeks ahead of time for seven pm on a Saturday. We arrived right on time - the hostess alerted me that they were a little behind but would seat us soon. So we took our group to the bar downstairs for a round of drinks. It took them thirty to forty minutes to seat us. But we tried to be understanding (despite the fact that the second couple was paying a babysitter 10 dollars an hour . . . )   We were sat - generally enjoyed our meal. But the service was lacking - for this level of restaurant you expect exceptional service - and frankly this caliber of food can be found elsewhere with good service and more reasonable prices.   We finished our meal (which was decent) we paid our check while we finished our dessert and drinks - but decided we would like to continue our conversation. We flagged down the waiter - who upon us requesting a round of drinks said \"my dad is getting pissed - so if you could sit at the bar . . . \" Our thoughts - so you took an extra forty minutes to seat us - when we had a reservation and now you want us to leave your table and you couldn't come up with a more tactful method of asking us to leave (note - it was 9:30/9:45 at this time, we had been at the table for about two hours, had a full meal (drinks, appetizers, entrees, dessert, second drinks - which equates to a full check and a hefty tip). Now I don't know who our waiters dad is . . . possibly the owner. But the professionalism at Rokerij was seriously lacking.   I don't know whether we will return. But we have concluded: (1) Rokerij does offer good food - but they are slightly over priced for the quality (2) the professionalism was seriously lacking in service (presentation of the wine list focused on the price and not the taste pallets), and (3) they should get their ego in check - I get that you have a long list of people waiting for tables at your restaurant - but the next time I have a special event I will be going to one of the dozens of restaurants in the valley and receive the level of service that should come with the ambiance and food.",

We grew up in Europe and lunch is the main meal of the day and we try to keep it that way since evening large meals are not very good for balanced diet and a good sleep. We had fish trio -was ok, some too spicy; the blackened steak -too peppery. The mushroom and filet toast were great. However the baked oysters were way too spicy- could not taste any oyster. Also we had the beef skewers- sort of dry but ok in the end.",

And the staff are friendly.  The kitchen area is actually surrounded by the bar, so if you're alone, sit at the bar and watch the action!  Sadly, I have to give only four stars as the pork chop I ordered was almost raw.  I ordered medium.  Even the fellow who picked up my plate commented saying, \"Wow, that is a little under done\".  Reheating meat ruins it for me, so i just ate a few (delicious) bites from around the edges of my chop.  The quality of the chop was excellent, and the seasonng was very good as well.  The mashed potatoes and asparagus were perfect.  Had the wedge salad to start, and that was very yummy too!  Anyway...  My chop was so undercooked that it should have been taken off my bill.  I did eat a few bites, so maybe a free dessert?  All I got was a thank you and a bill.  On my only previous visit, the food was really excellent, so 4 stars it is.",

The service was on point - our server even took the time to write all the specials (and their descriptions, and there are a LOT) down on a piece of paper because we were sitting right in front of them and thus couldn't really see. We didn't ask him to do that - he just took it up on himself. Totally unnecessary, but it's that extra mile, folks.   I got the Rokerij Benedict - all I can say is holy orgasm in my mouth. Forreals. Basically it's two little beef tenderloins on two english muffin halves, topped with CRAB and jalepeno hollandaise.  Probably one of the best things I have ever put in my mouth. Ever.   Their green chile potato is their signature item and I found it rather unremarkable for something that they promote so heavily. But it was fine.   Drinks were strong, atmosphere cozy, staff amazing.

They said they put the oil on it and I just needed to add the vinegar (strange). I added the vinegar and after taking the first bite I realized there was no oil.

    "text": "After hearing a lot of hype about Rokerij's and Richarson's New Mexico Cuisine we thought we'd try it. We were a party of four so we were able to make a reservation and the best time available was 5pm. (smaller parties without a reservation you'd sit at the bar). So it was an early dinner. We were first put in a booth with a seat back that is a wall. I was able to grab a pillow to lean against but without a pillow the wall is very uncomfortable. We asked to have out table changed and it was quite a dilemma for the hostess even though the restaurant at that time was almost empty. After saying we would leave they finally worked something out but we were made to feel it was an inconvenience for her to do a little juggling.  The food is okay. Large portions. I ordered the prime rib which is done a little different than usual since it it cut with a bone included and after cut seared on both sides so it looks more like a rib eye upon presentation. That being said the seasoning was tasty, it was cooked a perfect medium rare and is absolutely huge at least an 1\" thick but not as tender as I would have hoped.  My husband had the carne adovada which also was a huge dish of food.  Although it is considered spicy for my husband it could have been spicier. Our friends had the mahi mahi special and the seafood tagliatelle which she said was tasty but disappointing that it only had 2 shrimp and 2 scallops on it. We shared the trio dessert which consisted of almost crustless creme brulee, a dry flourless chocolate cake and a bland cheesecake that was like mousse. Our waitress was very nice but it seemed like we were being a little rushed. Before we could finish our salads the main course was being brought out and as soon as those plates were being cleared we were asked about dessert. But a shout out to our busboy who was excellent he was constantly filling water glasses made sure our take home items were complete and wrapped well and so very polite. Don't believe we will be back since it was a little out of the way for all of us and really not worth the trip back.",

I was happy to see during my visit that my hotel in Phoenix was near this New Mexican treat.  Actually, Rokerij is not New Mexican although it does have some of the flare.  I say this because the establishment immediately next door is New Mexican.  I was confused slightly by the app.  All of that being said, the atmosphere and culinary experience were fine dining.  Menu options were plenty, I recommend the Chimayo Chicken and it was delicious.  Very flavorful as one might imagine after reading the menu.  The spinach and poblanos with Asiago cheese were wonderful.  Tastes literally melted in my mouth.  I love food like this. The atmosphere was busy and happening yet intimate.  Perfect for a solo meal or with a group.",

I left most of my meal untouched. Nothing in its description made me think it would be ridiculously spicy. I also tried the cheesecake and creme brulee desserts. The cheesecake was weird, not the traditional type but more like a whipped cream and it was too sour. The creme brulee was just ok. This unfortunately is not a restaurant I would come back to.",

    "text": "I was brought here for my birthday by my husband who made a reservation in advance. He wanted to have a bottle of wine ready for me when we arrived, they said a bartender would call us back, they never did. We were seated immediately downstairs, which was requested, in a cozy corner booth. A really nice spot for just the two of us for a romantic dinner.  The wine selection is all new world wines, which was a little bit disappointing, but OK. That's probably what most people like. We were able to find a bottle of Willamette Pinot Noir for $48. It was decent.   We ordered the scallops that came with 4 different sauces for our appetizer. This dish was absolutely amazing. Each sauce was unique with different colors, different flavors, and different spice levels. There were some pinto beans mixed in, spanish rice, and the scallops were cooked to perfection, with a little caramelization and seasoned well.   For our entrees my husband ordered A steak, don't remember the exact type or size unfortunately, however he reports it was cooked as ordered at medium. It came with his choice of starch and vegetable. He ordered The roasted corn and poblano mashed potatoes. The way the server described the mashed potatoes, they would be extremely flavorful, however all it was was heat with no flavor. The corn was good he said.  I ordered a Seabass, it was cooked as described, very thin, with skin on. I asked for the sauce on the side because it was a butter, lemon caper sauce. The sauce itself was very good. The fish was cooked very well with a little bit of a crispiness to the outside. I ordered two vegetables instead of one vegetable and one starch. The beats were just beats although they were described as \"roasted.\" The asparagus which was also described as roasted, was basically warmed up. There was no char and no flavor indication that it was anything but barely warmed up. It tasted like I was eating raw asparagus.   The server was very friendly and very prompt in the beginning of the meal. Towards the end of the meal, she was not as prompt or attentive. My husband waited to order his second drink for quite a long time.   My second favorite thing was the dessert. We ordered the trio which was small portions of three different desserts that they had that night. One was a creme brulee, the second was a chocolate torte drizzled with a berry sauce, and the third was a cheesecake that came in the form more like a pudding with a little berry flavor in the middle. But definitely tasted just like cheesecake just with a different texture. All three were absolutely delicious especially the chocolate one.  If it were in my neighborhood, I possibly would pop in again just to try some other things, however due to the wine selection, mostly flavorless entree, and although not bad (just not as attentive as I would've liked - and promised because it was my birthday), it did not make the top restaurants in my mind, so I'm not sure if I will be back.   I will add that the ambience was dark, romantic, although fairly loud. We got reservations in the basement and it was very nice and cozy down there. Pretty cool stairs going back up to the street level after the dinner.",

However we were served by another waitress beforehand who got upset when we asked if she forgot about us, after leaving us twenty minutes without drinks. I believe she panned us off on Ashley after realizing we were a party of eight. It took a really long time for us to get drinks all night. When we asked for cups of ice, they stated their water was chilled. Aka no ice for us. Seems they don't do well with large parties. They treated us like we were a bother and didn't even have the common courtesy to explain ahead that they don't split checks or that you are paying $3 additional for extra sauces. Our table had $21 in sauces (sour cream, salsa etc.) When we questioned the bill she said \"well I don't make the prices.... \". Does that mean you also lack a sense of common courtesy?! Wasn't about the price, it was the principal.  When I asked for a dessert for the birthday girl, her first response was \"well It's not complimentary!\" I didn't ask if it was.  We had a $400 dollar bill. Would have been nice to be served by someone who actually deserved her 20%! I had to actually get up and ask her to take care of our bill, while she and two other employees stood at the bar looking over at us and whispered. I won't be returning! Neither will my friends. Who were really embarrassed that they suggested the place.",

It was my first time eating there and I ordered the Carne Adovada, it's a slow roasted pork marinated in what you could call red chili sauce, and comes with rice and beans. The pork was delicious but  the portion amount was disgusting large... and it  kinda made me want to gag, pork is not something one can consume in large portions, and it's like a delicacy so that was a little much. I did not take any food home because as we know , at least for my part the worst thing about Mexican food is that you can't save it for lunch tomorrow because during the reheating process it just taste weird. The tortilla that comes with it was great but it's not hard to get a tortilla right, my major complaint was the side dishes let's start with the beans which where salty and underwhelming. I think throwing some jalapeno and garlic in the mix will add much more dynamic to the beans, not to give you a mouthful ;) but lastly the rice was just as bad it was bland like mush... and this is coming from a  fat ^_^ half Mexican who spent many many years eating a ton of different types of rice again this is just my opinion, if your looking to give this place a shot I highly suggest it even if it's a one time  thing !",

My lovely friend wanted to bring me here and as deserted as it was it was nice to have a table by the fireplace. Our waiter was charming and the food more then made up for everything. We both went with Mexican meatloaf and eggs. Have you ever? Never would think of having that combo for breakfast. It came with beans and crispy hash browns. I liked the beans but the hashbrowns were ok. My friend chose the same item as I did and she chose the hot sauce mixed in with her meatloaf and eggs along with a Bloody Mary. Both were on the spicy side but she was happy. I had to have mine without any sauce and it was flavorful and good without needing the kick from me. This place is Also attached to a Richardsons  which is another place to eat with a lovely patio in between.  The coffee was good as well and it was worth the drive. Would probably have preferred it more for a dinner place but still good at breakfast/brunch.",

The host was all \"very helpful\" and asked what time I would like to be seated.  I said around 7-7:30.. to which he replied that they have very few tables for 2 and this time was already taken.  So then I asked what time is a table available?  He said he only has one table for two and it was taken.  So why did he ask in the first place - why not just tell me they are booked?  Went back and read the negative reviews and now I understand.",

Second of all its great food - although it is a little spendy.  Try and hit up some of the happy hour times (sit at the Bar only) also there are sometimes reverse happy hours 11pm-midnight.    This seriously is a great place to take someone on a late night date.  PLEASE enter by going down the stairs on the right.  It is really cool downstairs.  There is also upstairs seating and a bar but downstairs feels like you are in Boston!    They do not provide high chairs or booster seats so get a sitter and leave the kids at home.    Valet parking which I find annoying but it is tough to find parking at times.  Dress code - well its still Phoenix (and warm weather begs for casual) but it wouldn't hurt to step it up a notch.",

We are understanding, and realize in a small establishment there might be a delay in seating. No one ever apologized for the wait, or even acknowledged that we were seated half an hour late.   Then we were provided with underwhelming service, and waited for ten minutes to be greeted by our server, and an additional twenty for our drinks to arrive. It went downhill from there. We had a second set of salads arrive after we finished our first, a drink removed from the table before it was emptied, and when we requested boxes it took two attempts for them to show up. We saw our waitress multiple times at the table across from us, but she neglected to turn around and see how we were.   I requested to see a manager before we left, but Mario never arrived before we had to leave. Overall it was a terrible experience, the one thing that was a plus was our food. We have been many times before, and have never been as disappointed as we were with this experience.",

    "text": "This place seems to have gone down hill. I called over a week ahead for a Saturday night reservation for me and some out of town guests. At that time, I specifically asked for one of the tables downstairs by the fireplace and was told that would not be a problem.  A week later we showed up on time and was told our table was ready upstairs. I asked about a downstairs table and was told they were all taken, but I could wait for one. Irritated but hungry, I agreed to take one of the tables directly across from the very noisy kitchen.  It took a good amount of time for our waitress to come take our drink order and another good amount of time to deliver the drinks. Then after another wait, she came to take our order. We were seated underneath the chalkboard that shows the specials (which do not appear on the menu), but our waitress did not go over those with us at all.  The salads came out quickly and were delicious. Then there was another long wait for the food. Long enough that the waitress came by to say our food should be out in 7-8 minutes. Fifteen minutes later, two of our four entrees arrived. A few minutes later someone who was not our waitress was carrying around another of our entrees, but didn't know which table to take it to. He did return to our table shortly after and told us the final entree would be right out. After another 5 minutes or so, it finally arrived. However, that last entree, the top sirloin, was not cooked as requested. Rather than send it back and wait even longer, my friend just ate what she could. Luckily there was enough food to satisfy everyone and most of it was delicious.   I have always thought of Rokerij as a \"special\" dining experience. However, I think I'll find other options after this experience.",

    "text": "This place is amazing!!! My wife and I have been going here for a long time.  You cant beat the service (up top where the kitchen is).    They have a basement portion of the restaurant which is very romantic but we will never go down there because of the same server/bar tender who doesnt want a 2 top sitting at a 4 top.  When the host went down stairs last night to check he did the same exact thing.  I think management needs to speak with this employee.  Anyways he doesnt deserve our hard earned money for a tip!!!!  Bartender you missed out on a good tip but your attitude kills the vibe.    Back to the upstairs restaurant.  Happy hour is awesome as they have $6 wines and about 10 things on the HH menu, but of course you can order whatever you want off the regular menu.  Last night my wife and I shared the tomahawk steak (oscar style) with huge pieces of KING CRAB, twiced baked potato, broccoli, side salad (comes with the dinner), brie mushroom toast (app), and calamari (app).....of course we had to have the wine!!!  Amazing birthday dinner.  Anthony the host worked very hard in finding us a booth since we didnt want to enjoy our dinner at the bar area like we normally do.  We waited roughly 10 minutes and he sat us in a booth.  As a heads up this place only takes reservations for 4 or more people for booths, so you may or may not get lucky.    One of the patrons dropped his wallet under his bar chair and what do you know \"Anthony\" the host went over and picked it up and gave it to the gentleman!!!!! This was awesome to witness and shows integrity!!!  Nice job.  Spoke with Mario the manager and told him what type of an employee he has working at the front of the house.  Made our night.  Mario is a True professional in management!!!  Great evening out as always at this place.  They do have valet if you absolutely need it but im picky who drives my car so I choose the self park option and walk.",

    "text": "My friend and I headed to the Rokerij on a Saturday night. We called ahead to see if there were any available tables and were told that the first opening they had would be at 10 pm but that the bar serves the full menu, so we decided to go that route.   I can't say enough about the great service - our server was attentive and he had great suggestions. The dirty martinis were mixed to perfection and the wine selection is extensive. We decided to try and share four dishes between us, the pork belly three ways, New Mexican sausage, stuffed jalapeno peppers and the short ribs. The restaurant had come recommended to me with high praise by several people so I was looking forward to an amazing meal. Sadly, the food here didn't come to meet the high expectations.   First, the pork belly three ways was too tough and dry. And they weren't cooked three ways but sat atop a bed of three different sauces, one that tasted of a sweet barbecue sauce, another was a green chile sauce and another was a red sauce. I love the taste and mouthfeel of fatty pork belly and was looking forward to this experience when ordering the dish. It was just an unpalatable dish and I wish they had prepared the pork belly with more complexity and nuance.   The New Mexican sausage sat atop beans, and it was fine but nothing exceptional about the dish. The sausage tasted like breakfast pork sausage. And the dish was heavy on the salt.   The stuffed jalapenos were a little more promising - the jalapenos held their form and tasted fine. Again, heavy on the salt.   The most delicious dish were the spare ribs and rice. The dirty rice could have used less salt but the ribs were perfect - a nice balance of texture and the flavors were pleasant with a little hint of smoke.   We decided to order the creme brulee and it came topped with fresh fruit. We both enjoyed the dessert and found it to be a nice end to our meal.   I left feeling like I had just been to a salt lick, and this is coming from someone who loves salty foods. I think the restaurant needs to work on nuanced flavors and a better way to prepare the pork belly because it has a great amount of potential.   I highly recommend the cocktails and wine, and dessert but I would skip dinner altogether. Great space and nice atmosphere! Wished the restaurant had lived up to expectations.",

The only thing I would suggest is to sit as far away form the bar as possibly, It gets VERY HOT. If your entree does not come with the green chile potatoes, do yourself a favor and order a side! Cheesy potatoes baked into a chile are the only way to go!",

    "text": "After really enjoying a happy hour visit a few months ago, we finally went by for dinner.  It was terrific, with a few minor hiccups.  We arrived at 7 and were shocked to find a full parking lot and a line to get in.  Nonetheless, we were seated within 15 minutes.  We really love the atmosphere here.  Dark, urban and romantic with a kind of northeastern feel.  Drinks first.  We ordered a glass of red wine, a whiskey sour and an old fashioned.  The red wine came right away.  About 5 minutes later the waitress stopped by and said \"he's looking for the ingredients for the other drinks.\"  Hmmm.  We amused ourselves for the next 10 minutes wondering how a bar could not have the ingredients for a whiskey sour or an old fashioned.  She returned with the whiskey sour and said \"He just doesn't have the ingredients for an old fashioned.\"  FYI, here are the ingredients for an Old Fashioned: Bourbon Soda Water Sugar Bitters A cherry and an orange peel  We found this hilarious.  I changed my order to a Manhattan and that took about a minute to arrive.  Drinks here are large and strong.  Three of shared a steak tartare and ahi tuna app.  Both were excellent and the steak tartare was perfectly executed and presented.  The appetizers here really rock.  We ordered the three dishes that the waitress recommended, a chile rellenos (from the old Robertson's menu, which is also available), a chicken schnitzel and the beef tenderloin salad.    Dinner arrived and I took a bite of my \"chicken schnitzel.\"  Wow, that's some soft chicken I thought.  Wait a second  - that's not chicken!  The cook had apparently unilaterally upgraded me to the sea bass.  Well, no matter, it was delicious.  All in all a terrific dinner.  Service is charming and very friendly and the drinks and food are very satisfing, despite the occasional Fawlty Towers moments.",

The food here is always consistently good.  B/F loves the Chimayo Chicken with their fabulous Green Chili Potato.  Last night he had the roasted corn for the side which was amazing.  I got one of their specials - Swordfish with an fantastic pineapple cilantro salad and my sides were the GCP and zucchini.  Excellent meal all around.  My only complaint is, I wish they would get rid of the tv's or make it in a section that is away from the dining area.",

Rockerij is a stone building with a small parking lot (I'm from Texas so everything else is small). There were two options: the restaurant and the \"cellar\". Which did I choose you ask? The cellar, of course!  The cellar contained a few booth tables with throw pillows (how cool is that!), a long wooden bar and a roaring fire. My friend and I sat at the bar and I'm happy to report we were just in time for happy hour! Happy hour being from 3-6. I ordered a margarita, which was delightfully lovely with a hint of fresh squeezed orange juice. I've never had a margarita that tasted like that!   Food wise, my friend and I shared the Ahi Tuna with wasabi salsa and soft shell tacos. The Ahi was perfect, lightly seared and the salsa was a perfect combination. The tacos were good, not amazing but good. The chicken taco had the best flavor.",

An attempt to go here last summer was quashed by a kitchen fire.  Needless to say, the blue crab tostadas also impressed.    The ambiance at Rokerij is such that you just want to stay and relax for the rest of the night -- (I was late to my next Friday night stop!!). The dark cavernous feel of the place lends itself well to a special night out.  Wine service was adept and the server was refilling our chardonnay very regularly.   The chimayo chicken was stellar - decked out and rolled with spinach, sundried tomatoes, poblano chile, asiago cheese and drizzled with an onion sauce and accompanied by mashed potatoes served in a green chile. A stunning combination of flavors -- spicy, smoky, rich and healthy at once.",

    "text": "Impressed on so many levels with this stashed-away gem in Phoenix. I had heard of Richardson's, and for my friend's going away/belated birthday dinner, he requested that we go to Richardson's \"other restaurant.\"  Like any good yelper I checked its profile out and the peoples' who's opinions and tastes I've come to trust had me sold on it. A subsequent AOL City Guide review page was less than inspiring - complaints about them closing the upstairs dining area and diners who were less-than-impressed with the menu - they (the AOLers) came off sounding like snobs in their reviews, anyway, so I didn't let it bum me out, but I wasn't sure what to expect.  Based on the price range and what I'd heard, I was prepared for a 40s-60s married couple crowd and elegant/traditional dcor that would appeal to that demographic; this assumption was further believed when we pulled up and saw those exact couples leaving the parking lot.  However, we drove up (complimentary valet is required) and went thru a wooden door into a stone stair chamber (seriously, it felt like a secret passageway in a castle) to another wooden door that opens into the bar area (I was assured on the phone when I made reservations about three days ahead of time for the Sat night that we would get a table, or you can wait for a table or belly up at the bar to eat).  Anyway, the crowd was very up-and-coming (for reals, not like Scottsdale mall Kona Grill happy hour, \"I'm in real estate\" up-and-comers) late 20s to late 30s crowd, the flat screen TV behind the bar was playing ESPN and the Cure (!) was playing...I was in love. It was still white table cloth and wood accents nice, but the subtle, muted tv and just high enough music volume were enough to make it seem more like a bar than a stuffy restaurant.   I was told it was Dutch-inspired (so executed by the Dutch impressionist works all over the walls) but the food is basic \"new American\" grill faire. New twists on old favorites...along with favorites basic mashed potatoes (except these come out souflee style), bacon-wrapped scallops, prime rib ($32) and Chilean sea bass ($28? $34?) (all of which we ordered, and ate, and it was all excellent).  We also got a bottle of wine for $25 - not bad. That was one of the least expensive ones, it goes up to the $200s from there. Oh, we also had crme brulee (divine, freshly made with real vanilla bean and served cold, not hot) and coffee to top it all off. Whew! We were pretty drunk, very full and very, very happy with our experience. (the music selection also continued to impress, surprise me - The Killers, Morrissey  Oh! I can't forget the server...he was professional (not snobby), knowledgeable and helpful - he will give you his honest opinion on which dishes he likes and doesn't.   Oh! And, for a higher-dollar establishment, I was very happy to see they didn't try to charge for every little thing - for $32 I got a salt and pepper encrusted prime rib, the giant side of mashed potatoes, asparagus and a salad (you even get to choose from four specialty salads); a steal, really.  Ok, I'm done gushing. If you want a romantic dining spot, this works. If you want a nicer place to grab drinks with people who will appreciate the menu, the ambiance can't be beat.",

    "text": "Eating Review of Rokerij  I want to like this place. Its a great setup and well done environment. The setting is stylish and dark so you want to sink into a booth and get down to eating some food.  Unfortunately my first experience has left an impression that is less than stellar. My girlfriend and I had been wanting to try it out a few times. We got a booth by the fireplace and settled in for a nice meal.  The specials are written up in chalk on the wall as you walk in which is a great method for displaying specials. We are both vegetarians that will eat fish and were excited by the plethora of fish dish choices on the specials board. This tends to say that a place can do fish.  Our server was nice enough but when we asked for some recommendations he stared at us blankly and grabbed the menu like he hadnt eaten there in a while. This is a huge pet peeve for me. If a place is gonna charge $20 or more for an entree the staff better be trained on the dishes and be ready to give some recommendations. Show some passion and knowledge and sell me the good stuff.  We ordered the White Bean Bruschetta to start. It was edible but lacking in flavor, maybe some salt wouldnt have hurt, but something more than just beans and toast please.  Next was the soup of the day which had a lot of smoke flavor going on, not impressed.  Finally we went with the sesame crusted fish with a melon salsa. This dish started off a disaster and just got worse. First of all the server brings it over holding it with a towel. As We shift plates around to make room he starts yelping a bit in pain. Not a great sign. Once he gets it set down we move to dig in but my lovely date brushes her arm on the plate and comes away with a pretty solid burn.  This is just plain stupid. There is no need for a plate to be 200 degrees. Cook the food and then bring it out. Dont cook it at my table on the plate!  Unfortunately the fish was not edible, at all. The melon salsa was horrid. We sent it back and still got charged.  Rokerij I want to love you. There are a lot of folks on Yelp that love you but I have to say that for food you have not impressed me.",

It was recommended by my friend who's local here when I first moved, and I like taking whoever visits me here.   We've only had small plates and I think I've liked all of them. My top faves are: shrimp scampi with dirty rice, blue crab tostada, beef tenderloin toasts, jumbo shrimp (or scallops) wrapped in bacon, and ahi. The ones that were ok were the ceviche, stuffed mushrooms, and sliders, probably bc I've better elsewhere.  Last time we went, the guy next to me ordered 3 portions of the bacon wrapped shrimp. That's a lot of bacon! But it's that good =)",

    "text": "I was here with friends for drinks and dinner last Thursday evening, and I have to say that nothing about this restaurant was acceptable for any of us.  First, we didn't have reservations and were greeted with slightly rude service by the host.  However, I think she noticed that we were a little taken aback by the attitude, and quickly changed her mood.  In the downstairs bar, we ordered drinks while we waited for a table to open up for us.  The bartender made a mistake while preparing my friend's Bloody Mary, accidentally dumping an enormous amount of tabasco in her drink.  However instead of simply making a new one, he served it to her anyway (admitting his mistake while setting it down in front of her) and told her to let him know if she didn't like it and wanted a new one.  Of course she tried it, couldn't drink it and had to ask for a new one.  After we got to our table upstairs and ordered our appetizers and meals, things got worse.  It took well over half an hour to get our appetizers, and when we did they were cold.  We were not sure that our oysters were supposed to be as cold as they were, but the fact that they had congealed melted cheese seemed to indicate that they should haver at least been warm.  After we finally got our salads (about 45 minutes after ordering), we were rushed through them before getting our meals just a couple minutes later.  None of us enjoyed our meals, as we found them either burnt or bland.  Even though we made a few complaints about our meal to the server, when our check came we found that we had been charged for everything and were only offered a very pallid apology for the obvious problems with our meal.  this was not an inexpensive meal, either, so we will likely not be back!",

Someone else got one of the pizzas which was delicious with goat cheese and garlic, my brother got the meat trio special and was in heaven.  Then we got a tiramisu and creme brulee for dessert, the creme brulee was everyone's favorite -- vanilla bean flavor with berries.

    "text": "I don't put five stars down for anybody.   However, the Rokerij is number one in my book.   I love their apps!! I love it when you can find a place and you KNOW you love their food. Some have boring, conservative menus, like....well, I shouldn't say, but there's one on the SE corner of Camelback and 32nd.   But the Rokerij has blue crab mini tostadas that surprise your mouth with their freshness, cold lettuce (it hasn't wilted on the way downstairs to the basement from the kitchen) and it's a snack, not a meal. So, you can taste four appetizers and enjoy tasting your favorites or finding new ones and not spend lots of money just getting full on one thing.  They say the Rokerij basement is a cell-free zone. That's because as you descend each slate/rock step downwards, right off the wood front deck, the signal mostly won't go through! So, you can get in your uninterrupted girl talk or romantic moments with someone you want to be one-on-one with. I love the wood beams, the hammered copper bar, the leather furniture, the stone walls and the intimate fireplace. It's dark. And it feels good.  I usually get those blue crab tostadas, shrimp and bacon wrapped scallops and the ceviche. But then, wouldn't you know, someone told me about a new favorite, steak tacos! Huh? I don't eat beef. Sort of. Bye bye ceviche!  And the insider's secret that I will hate you for if you take my place at the bar (the offer is good at both the upstairs and downstairs bars...I just called to make sure the details were right), is that if you are sitting at the bar and order certain apps BEFORE THEIR clock strikes 6 pm, (4-5:59 pm on THEIR clock, very important),   THEY ARE $5 EACH!   Some don't get discounted. But my favs do!   Tell them Roseann sent ya. They just learned I can have fun. I've been goin since they opened. I guess I just don't drink enough alcohol for them to see the fun side. Oh well. What can I say? Hangovers just don't cut it anymore. Although, the more car bombs you have, the more you can forget that. I learned. Again. Two weeks ago.",

Oh, and if you get an entree, make sure you get the spinach salad (one of three salad choices). The bf, who is less adventurous in his cuisine choices chose the chicken enchiladas, which he ate every bit of.

This is the first time my wife and I have been to the Rokerij and it was truly a fun and happy experience. Been to Dick's Hideaway and the older Richardsons many times in the past. The selection on the menu here has several of the same tasty good SW options with some really nice EuroAmerican surprises.  Love the way you can instantly smell the aroma of the Pecan wood coming from the sizzling grill. Pecan gives the food some very nice flavor and that extra kick. Everything here and his other restaurants always taste great and leave you satisfied.  Upstairs and downstairs are both the Rokerij now. Upstairs is quite a bit larger with a nice bar and a larger seating area. Downstairs has a top secret elevator or you can take the stairs. It is smaller and offers food and drinks as well. Could even be a nifty bomb shelter in a parallel universe.  We started off with some Prime Rib Sliders and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp. My boss and his lovely wife ordered the New Mexican Platter and the Salt and Pepper Encrusted Prime Rib. My wife order the awesome Chimayo Chicken and yours truly went with the tasty Grilled Swordfish Special. Chocolate Flan with a 1/2 shot of Grand Marnier completed the trifecta.  Really love the way they layer the flavors. The atmosphere of this place and friendly servers are also a delight. We arrived early and were able to get a large table by their cozy rustic fireplace.  Place gets really busy quick. Try and go before the crowd and you will enjoy everything that much more. When we were leaving it was starting to get crazy. DRINKS ON ME EVERYONE!  5 STARS",

We all tried to roll with it and find other things on the new menu. We should have left for another restaurant. I decided on a skirt steak that was a special he mentioned that had a black peppercorn sauce. It came with no sauce. When I asked for it he said they were out of it. WTH, how is it a nightly special and your out of the sauce at 5:30. Dads scallops were tough, moms dish was meh. They did take mine off the bill without me having to ask but other then the company of my parents the meal sucked. I left 3/4 of it there. No doggy bags were needed for any of our meals. Will not return.",

    "text": "Lol....okay, we went from one extreme to the other re timing.    I made a reservation for our anniversary and we got a great little table tucked in the corner downstairs.  We were looking forward to a romantic and relaxing experience.  The food was outstanding.  I had the filet and crab and my husband had the salmon special.  Both salads we started with, as well as the creme brule we finished with very good.  The service was crazy in their timing.  We had just barely ordered when both salads arrived....which was fine, except that then the gentleman helping our server kept trying to pick up our plates while we were still eating.....we had them about 10 minutes before we had to give them up because our entrees had suddenly arrived.  We hadn't even had a chance to touch our pre-entree drinks yet so we just pushed them aside.  It was our anniversary, it was 7:30 and the place was empty.  What's the rush?    The bar tending staff was great and we did stay later because of him.  I'd say a 4+ for food, a 5 for ambience and I don't know what to say about service, very personable and knowledgeable on the floor, but the timing with the kitchen is about the most bizarre thing I've seen is this caliber of restaurant....it's dragging down the results.",

I had heard that the downstairs had great atmosphere, but upon arrival, it felt more like a sports bar. We decided to head upstairs where the music wasn't quite so loud. We had good service once we got up there and the atmosphere was decent. Unfortunately, the food left so much to be desired; which is unfortunate when you're celebrating a special occasion.   We ordered an appetizer of crab stuffed mushrooms, which were on the small side and could have used some bread to soak up the extra sauce. They were just \"okay\" and I wouldn't recommend them. Next came our salad which was huge but uninspiring. The dressing was bland and it consisted of an enormous amount of lettuce with some croutons and a few cherry tomatoes. We both ordered the seafood tagliatelle which consisted of two shrimp and two scallops on a bed of overcooked pasta without much of a sauce (was it just a blob of butter?) for $27 a pop. We thought we might at least enjoy our dessert, but that was disappointing as well. We ordered the trio which consisted of tiny versions of creme brulee, flourless chocolate cake (the highlight) and cheesecake. Both the creme brulee and cheesecake were thin in consistency and not very memorable.  This was such a disappointing way to spend our special evening and our hard-earned money. This seems like a better place to get a cocktail than to have a meal.",

    "text": "This was our first time at Rokerij.  There was a little confusion of where to sit us although there were several open spots. PBS was there filming so I think the staff was a little distracted but everyone was super nice. Our server was a sweetheart and her trainee was very friendly.  We ordered bloody Mary's which were spicy just like I like them. They were garnished with celery, pickled asparagus, and lemon and came with a small beer back.  We ordered the Tomahawk ribeye (medium) with green chilli and blue cheese, Brussel sprouts, mashed potatoes, and salad and the Prime rib (medium) with Au jus and horseradish, mashed potatoes and corn, and salad. We had no idea they would be so huge. The flavors of everything was delicious.  The only thing we added a touch of salt to was the corn.  The reason I gave them 4 stars was after a considerable wait between salads and the entrees both meats were under temp.  We ordered medium on both.  The prime rib was medium rare with outer edges medium. The ribeye was very rare with only the very outer edge on one side being barely medium rare. I know it's a thick cut of meat but so does the restaurant cooking it so they should know how to properly adjust to cook to temp any thickness.  I told our server but she just said \"well it is thick\" but in such a sweet voice I didn't press the issue especially since I knew I was taking the majority home with me and that when I reheat it that it will cook it further. But I hope management was told so he can instruct his kitchen and also his servers on what to do.  I don't know if the manager was informed because a manager never came by.",

At first glance it is a difficult to see the restaurant from the main road and it is connected to another restaurant/bar with the same owner and wider selection of a menu. Rokerij is smaller and has a dark ambience. It was a difficult atmosphere to read the menu for older adults, but is provided with an excellent staff that is super friendly and willing to give suggestions and ask about your experience with the food. Overall our food was delicious, the menu is limited but has options for all taste buds. A highly recommended spot and don't forget to go downstairs to the speakeasy for a night cap.",

    "text": "This is the biggest disappointment of dining out so far this year! I went with 4 members of my family last Monday. We were seated right away but service was a bit sluggish after the water was served. We ordered appetizers and receipt of them was staggered, first one, then the other. Possibly that is their procedure, but seemed unusual. The appetizers seemed over baked/cooked but were tasty. The main course was served after considerable delay. Four of the main course was served on very hot platters but the fifth didn't get delivered. We all waited to begin eating until all were served and after an 18 minute wait ( thank heavens for hot plates) his main dish arrived. Our dishes were very over cooked and not enjoyable. We arrived at 6:30 and left at 9:00 and we were  not happy diners!  In my humble opinion, this is an overrated restaurant!",

Late eats makes it the perfect place for a night cup.  The flowerless chocolate cake is to die for, and I'm a flower type of girl.  Drinks are crafted and the wine selection is pretty good.",

    "text": "VERY LOUD.  I don't have tinnitus but my ears were ringing when I left.  The food is expensive and average  The service is great  I won't be back because of the price/food quality and the VERY LOUD NOISE inside.  Or.  You can sit outside and battle the flies..  UPDATE:  ok. I have a girlfriend, and she told me I had to go back.   So I pulled in to the complimentary valet and smiled at the thought of detailing everything wrong with this crappy restaurant.  I went through the barrage of flies in the breezeway and entered to the left into the smoky loud indoor section and didn't see her.  Then...  A waitress appeared and said, \"Doug? Follow me please...so out through the breezeway of flies and into..a much better environment.  Kinda loud..but what do you expect from half drunk old people right?  The waitress was PERFECT...she was genuinely happy to take my order and suggested the perfect items.  The nasty odor of the other side of the restaurant is nearly non existent on the 'right side' of the breezeway.  And the food was great.    Only $186.00 for three to have lunch.   Hmmm. 2 1/2 stars to average out this place.  And only because the waitress is the definition of perfect.",

    "text": "Rokerij (pronounced ro-ker-ee) is a Richardson restaurant that might as well just be part of the Richardson restaurant. I'm still slightly confused as how they're a different restaurants when they literally have the same menu, but whatever.  We made reservations for Rokerij at 7pm on Saturday. They seat us, we order, and we did not get our food until around 8:15pm, which is absolutely ridiculous. When they brought out our food, we all thought the wait was over, but it we probably waited another twenty minutes as they slowly brought our food out, one by one. They also got one of our orders wrong, which meant another ten minute wait for our food. The staff apologized repeatedly, but they simply do not have enough hands working the kitchen.   If you do end up coming here, keep in mind that the food could be all over the place. Some dishes were okay, some were cold, some had burnt cheese on the side. However, the New Mexican enchiladas are pretty good and you can never go wrong with some cheesy deliciousness!",

The reason I am writing this review is because both times I dealt with managers that are the definition of professional and customer service. Shout out to the managers because of you we will go back a third time and continue sending people your way.",

The bartender Steve is by far the best there is.  Try to arrive for happy hour and order the small plates. You wont want a meal after you eat them. $5 each during happy hour or $9 each during peak times. Also to get the deal, you have to be seated AT the bar and not at any of the surrounding tables. Kind of lame but whatever.  My dad is a big steak guy who lives in NY and gets only the best. The Rokerij's steaks rival some of Manhattan's top joints like Sparks!  Beer selection is solid, although they could use a few more draft selections and the wine list is good.  Again--don't even bother dining upstairs. Enjoy the dark cellar, dimly lit by the fireplace, with The Cure, Coldplay and other great bands rotating on the cd player.",

Came here at the recommendation of an Arizonan primarily because I wanted to experience a prickly pear margarita before going back to Hawaii. They had it but not blended. When I ordered it blended with salt, our server said, and this is a direct quote, \"We don't have a blender.\" Seriously? Had it on the rocks and it was just okay, not $10 okay. The food was eclectic and delicious. Be aware when your server asks if she can start you with chips and salsa, and guacamole. One would think it's a free standard at Mexican restaurants, even fusion ones. Nope. Showed up as a $13 charge for a large guacamole -- and the guacamole was awful. Too salty. Very little of it was eaten. The half price wine Sundays and Mondays advertised on their specials wall? Not. At least not by the glass. Showed up on the bill full price. I didn't dispute that or the chips/guacamole because a). It was our last night in Arizona and b). my entree, the chimayo chicken, was fabulous. I liked the ambience of the place even though it was much darker than I'm accustomed to. My husband enjoyed his relleno platter and my daughter liked, not loved her #3 pizza.",

Wine list is stellar and I have never had a wine there I didn't like. I mean, I have never really had a wine anywhere I didn't like, so take it for what it's worth.  Pretty decent beer list and the martinis and margaritas are solid.   Food is consistently one of those meals you are still talking about the next day. Went there recently with a group of 6. Roasted garlic as an appetizer? I was hesitant, but it was subtle buttery goodness that we all raved about. The carne adovado is a classic, never go wrong dish to order for dinner that a few people got. I typically order one of the fish specials and they are always creative dishes with an interesting sauce option. This time I got the seabass which was cooked to perfection and swimming in a chipotle orange sauce that I could've poured over anything (and everything) which I did with the accompanying vegetables.   Not a place for kids-- in fact, I don't think they even have high chairs, so its a date night kinda place. Good news is-- if you didn't bring your kid, you aren't stuck next to another kid anyways. And I have to appreciate that.",

We learned that they have half off bottles of wine sun, mon, and tues!  The food and service is always great. However, we were sad to hear that they are not doing the reverse happy hour late night that we frequent to often. Where are we going to go now? Anyone have suggestions for a new late night happy hour with great food?",

The booths have plenty of space for laying out notes, etc., without being cramped.  The sound level is perfect - easy to hear your companions (unlike Richardson's), yet muted enough that people at the next table don't hear everything. Also, it's sophisticated enough to avoid the \"date\" atmosphere so dreaded in a business lunch locale.  Tasty choices for all palates, though vegetarian selections are pretty much limited to some salads. I've tried to hit the happy hour a few times but the happy hour prices are limited to those seated at the hard-to-get bar seats.  If you are not there early, don't plan on the happy hour deals.",

    "text": "So I have been wanting to come to this joint for EVA! How-EVA, our experience was not fabulous. It was more like DRAB-ulous. Things started out great when we snagged a cozy little table in the corner about 9pm on a Friday night. The liquor wall looked too tempting to pass up, so I ordered a Gibson with some Tito's vodka (my fav!)- well the cocktail onions were soggy and mushy upon first bite and it pretty much ruined the drink. The server did not offer to bring me something different, he just apologized and looked for the jar of onions and said they are all like that. Hmmmm. There were a MILLION specials. It took like 5 minutes literally to read the entire list. It was baffling. The prices are NOT cheap. We were already thinking we should give this place a shot during $5 plate happy hour. Anyway then we ordered some grilled oysters. Well, they came out with Chirozo on them- and I barely eat seafood, but definitely not pork! All the server said was \"Well it listed the chorizo on the menu\"- Hmmmmmm. Again, we just kept them. Then my boyfriend tried one and it was full of sand! At this point, we had already ordered the mushroom toast points, but after the oyster debacle, we had pretty much decided to go elsewhere and especially when the next appetizer came, it just was overloaded with brie and canned looking mushrooms, totally overcooked and unappetizing. We politely told the server that we were just going to call it a night (there was NO WAY we were going to spend 35-40 bucks on the entree lottery)- he then offered to \"do anything\" to make our experience better and we thanked him and just explained why we were leaving and we would be back to try the happy hour another time (truth). Anyway then he took like 15 minutes at least trying to get the manager to take the oysters off (I would rather have paid for them) and then he FINALLY brought us our bill with the two drinks AND the uneaten mushroom appetizer. I am a foodie and have been in the business since I was 15 and I NEVER EVER want anything for free or removed from my check, however, there are certain circumstances- and I must say I can not remember having a completely horrible experience like this one on a long time- where I feel  that as a server, let alone a manager- I would comp the entire tab and offer to have the guest back on some sort of gift certificate or comp.  Again, I NEVER EVER look for anything free in a restaurant, but if you had been sitting in my shoes last night, you would agree this experience warranted some above and beyond customer service to retain guests in the future. Well that didn't happen, perhaps they have been around so long they just figure oh well who cares, we are well known so whatever. Well, whatever is I will NEVER attend that restaurant or any of their other concepts, plus now I have written a poor review, and all my FB friends know about it too. I'm sure in my life moving forward Rokerij will also come up in conversation with some of my foodie friends and they too will know I think this place is overrated. We left the waiter a very nice tip and thanked them by never attending their establishment again. Such a shame. Customer service is dead these days... SIgh....Hope it was worth the $30 bucks guys.",

Her plate was very generous for the cost.  I sampled the Pork Tomalles with the Green and Red Sauce.  This was great, the green sauce was excellent, but the red was a bit spicy for my taste.  The service was top notch through out.  And treat yourself to the margarita......you will not be disappointed.  The $5 plates for happy hour are a good deal, definately time your trip for this.

The next time we decided to try it for an early dinner but then decided to sit at the bar since happy hour is 5$ for appetizers(small plates). This is where the place really shines. The onion rings are the best I have had, The filet mignon skewers were excellent. The bacon wrapped shrimp were good but nothing to write about, but the prime ribsliders were top notch. We left with a small bill after a few drinks and some good food and vowed to go with friends again soon.  Go at happy hour and sample some small plates.",

    "text": "Poo poo on all the naysayers.   Rokerij is bad ass, which is why it is always wicked crowded. The ambiance is a teeny bit cowboy, some rustic Flagstaff, some Old-world European, and ALL sexy - grotto staircase leading to dim and plush with roaring fireplaces scattered about. The menu is diverse - plenty of funk and weirdness for the more adventuresome, but some more traditional favorites for your conservative friends. All I care about is that they still make me my beloved veggie quesadillas, bursting with roasted broccolini and corn and filled with just the right amount of cheese, served on a wooden cutting board with two kinds of fresh, flavorful, and just-enough-spicy salsa. It's so good, it keeps me from trying the small plates, which sound scrumptious.  I'm not sure where all the bitching and moaning about the service come from. Our last visit here was on a packed and swinging Saturday night where we had to wait an hour for a table. Our server was prompt, attentive, and competent, although some odd comments (\"What a good looking table! Are you brother and sister?\") left us scratching our heads.   The crowd is entertaining as well, although I don't think you'd find me scrounging around for a date. Lots of cougars and cougars-in-training with flashy jewelry and spray on tans. Despite this potentially stiff crowd, the place was lively and everyone seemed to be having a perfectly good time. The crowd may overlap somewhat with the 40th St/Campbell BMW- and Range Rover-driving MILF yuppie sect, but somehow it all seems a lot less pretentious here.   The word is that the neighboring DQ is going to be torn down to make room for the rebirthed Richardson's. Woo! Between Rokerij and Richardson's, this corner is going to rival 40th St & Campbell.

    "text": "Dear reader.... Before you decide if this place is great... think about what else you consider great.  When you were 17 and you took a date to Olive Garden, okay, you get a pass.  BUT, if you ever ever ever went on a date to Outback, or Red Lobster... just stop right now.  You will think this place is just amaaaaazing.  So come out, enjoy their food and on the way home jump out into traffic. (Please do that behind me, so as not to make me late to work.)  Okay, that said... This place struggles from an identity crisis.  Rokerij, who are you appealing to?  The fools that think that this is a classy joint because their previous best date was to Applebees?  OR are you a really good place?  This place should not have a $12 chicken sandwich with fries on the same menu as a $43 steak.  Choose one direction and stick with it.    I called up at 6pm on a Saturday, first available reservation was for 9pm.  This is a good sign.  I take the reservation and then went for a hair cut at Urban Hair... see my other review, they rule.  We get to Rokerij at 830ish.  I walk in the door, and apologize to the staff who are clearly at a waiter station.  We must have walked in the side door.  Whoops!   No, thats the front.  Wait, what?  A friggin computer screen and some silverware, thats the front?  No no, it cant be... oh yes.  Yes, this is phoenix.  Yes, this is the front.  Okay, okay... im cool... whatever.  We will be downtstairs having a drink.  The bar downstairs is okay.  Some 50 yr old dude trying to flirt with a 20something girl.   Standard.   We have martinis.  Not bad, the bartender made it okay.  Chopin vodka.  He didnt really know what to do with the vermouth, but it was okay.    I chat with my friend, we are sitting on a couch, its pretty fun so far.  A server comes down and says, \"your table is ready\"  Cool.  We stand up.  She goes over and starts talking to the 50yr old male cougar and his little cub.  We wait.... finally i walk over to her.  AH HEM... should we just go upstairs?  She turns  \"yep, i said it was ready.\"  Oooooh no.  You had better walk my ass right up to my table.  Nope, i can already tell the service is going to be abysmal.    We walk upstairs.  We wait there for almost 5 min.  Then i grab a bus boy and in broken espanol, i ask him... neccecitamos una mesa... ya dig?  He starts wiping down a table.  I ask my date... why the hell do we have reservations again?  Then as we are being seated, a hostess girl says, \"oh your table is over here\"  WELLL princess, thanks so much for telling me that 10 min ago....  and we sit.   The waitress comes over and says \"what can i get ya?\"  Excuse me Maude... what is this a diner?  Can i get a slice a pie and a glass of manners?  I ask her what her name is... i then introduce myself and start to read some of the specials off of the wall.  She gets the hint.  I hate my decision to come here.  We order more martinis... Vodka might make this better.   We order some specials... i get meat, lots of it.  The food is very good, though pricey.  Im still annoyed that there is a $10 cheeseburger on the menu.  Dont get me wrong, i love a PBR and a Burger... just not what i was expecting after all of the reviews i read.    When the time comes to order dessert, i think to myself... seriously, lets just stop at starbucks.  We get our check.    The bottom line.  This place has good food, but is not a fancy joint.  If people said, its a decent bar with good food, i would say: \"heck yes, 4 stars, just needs some better service.\"  But they think they are classy, and so does yelp... its not.  Frankly, It shouldnt have anything on the menu over $27.  The service is friggin dreadful.  A half drunk toddler could manage this place better.     That is all...",

Instead, you walk into a dark, somewhat edgy space dominated by a L shaped center bar area that is for dining. the bar is surrounded by cozy booth seating. Specials are on the chalk board walls which take up all the wall area. Monday night was 50% of all bottles on the wine list. Since Rokerij already has a reasonably priced wine list, this is a great deal. The menu is eclectic and has numerous choices. The sister restaurant Richardson's burned down, so they decided to use two menus, the normal Rokerij menu as well as the Richardson menu.  In addition, to these two separate menus, they have an extensive list of nightly specials. The food was fresh and well prepared, especially the vegetables.",

    "text": "We are a group of 7 who call ourselves the FNF (Friday-Night-Foodies). We eat together nearly every Friday evening. We like good service and good food and are willing to drive anywhere in the Valley and pay for a great evening. On the 6th of July, we went to the Rokerij.  We have been to the Rokerij several times over the last 18 months. Each time we visit the Rokerij, the quality of the food and the service declines. But my husband, who very much likes their double cut, chorizo stuffed pork chop,   chose the Rokerij to celebrate his birthday. Early in the week, we booked a reservation for 7 people -   When we arrived (remember they knew the size of our group and the time of our arrival) they scrunched us in a booth designed for 4 or 5 and then appended two uncomfortable chairs as an afterthought to the end of the booth table. The chairs were not the right height for the table and they were in the aisle where they were bumped by everyone moving through the area - really awful.   I guess the waiter thought we were his buddies because he recognized us from earlier visits. Somehow this recognition gave him the right to behave overly familiar to the point of being flippant.  In addition to the rude waiter and the really uncomfortable, cramped and dark booth we were seated in, here are a few other specifics.  Early in the week when my husband booked restaurant, he asked specifically if he could still get the chorizo stuffed pork chop. He was assured he could. When he ordered it, he was informed it was no longer on the menu. When he expressed his dismay, the waiter requested the kitchen to concoct a similar substitute which was chorizo between to pork chops. It arrived overcooked, dry and not at all resembling the real thing.  I ordered the sea bass. It arrived smelly to the point of concern (yuck) and looked and tasted more like snapper or tilapia than sea bass. When I complained, our buddy, the waiter said it was California not Chilean sea bass. Well for nearly $40, I would have expected that be explained on the menu and before I ordered it not when it arrived. It was totally inedible.  We ordered appetizers of bacon wrapped shrimp and bruschetta. The bacon was nearly raw, the shrimp were overcooked and tough and the bruschetta should have been described as tasteless, soggy bread with a blob of bottled salsa. I think there may have been sauces on the shrimp that would have been interesting but it was hard to get a taste with a fork...Why won't they supply spoons to get to the sauces? Why does the Rokerij have such a disdain of serving spoons?   And, similar to their \"serving spoon issue\", what's with that no straws policy? Really? I brought a baggie with straws from home but at these prices, can't they just give me a straw through which I can drink my Belvidere? I mean, the drink was the only good thing I had all night.  We agree, we may try the Rokerij one more time but after that, if it isn't better, we will take the Rokerij off the FNF list.",

The menu is great for brunch, lunch  or dinner. But their happy hour is by far my favorite. Probably one of the best in the area.  The appetizers and wine by the glass are only $5.00 each. Five dollars for high quality food, such as tuna wasabi sashimi, scallops wrapped in bacon, and steak tartare. And an amazing wine selection to choose from.   This is a happy hour where you can eat a couple healthy, high protien items and drink a glass of good wine, all for under $20.00.   Do not get me wrong, I would still go there any other time, other happy hour and pay double. Its well worth every dollar.",

The service was sort of not with it, but she did check on us and stuff. Just sort of \"lights on nobody's home\" head in the clouds. She wasn't horrible, but not what you expect when ordering a $22 entree. I like the prices and ambiance here, even better they took reservations for our party of 4. Overall its a great way to break out of the rut. Wish they'd opena lunch place with lighter offerings downtown.",

In my opinion, the best time to come here is for brunch. Yes, even on a Sunday nursing a hangover, the food, drink and decor can't be beat. Very reasonably priced mimosas and bloody's as well as some of the best breakfast items you could ask. My fave is the eggs benedict with thier Mexican twist - the carne adovada is also amazing and very satisfying. No skimping on the meat here, and it's not drowning in sauce - I have yet to finish a full plate of anything. Thier potatoes even get my mouth watering.    Service was great the last time we went, but the first time we had to go up to the bar to remind the gal we were there. After that she was more than attentive and the food more than made up for it. I could linger here for hours and get in some serious trouble!   Have not been to the downstairs area or had any other meal here, but can't wait to go back!!!",

I wanted two things a solid Eggs Benedict and an awesome Bloody Mary.  The Eggs Benedict included a hard boiled egg and lacked any flavor.  The Bloody Mary was lame, no spice, no bite at all. Kid's didn't like the dutch pancake, this isn't a negative, just some information.  It tastes like french toast, if you like that then go for it.  Moving on from the food was the service. Service was horrible, the waitress forgot all about us multiple times.  All our glasses were empty most of the time.  I would never recommend this place.   On the plus side my wife recovered with Snooze on father's day.  That place is awesome.  Go their for breakfast.",

What a mistake. Although the drinks and food were very good the service was awful. We had to wait quite a while for our drinks and appetizer to be served. I asked for bread and butter 3 times and although i saw other tables get it we did not till the bartender came over and said she was helping our waiter. At this point we still had not ordered out entrees. After a long wait we finally ordered our entrees and they came pretty quickly and were very good. After another long wait our table was finally cleared. A short time later a different waiter brought  over a slice of chocolate cake with a birthday candle. He stood their while we sang happy birthday then he walked away leaving us with no utensils to eat the cake. At this point we asked to speak to the manager. The manager came over and we told him about our experience and he did his best to take care of us. I will definitely not be going back due to this experience. Sometimes I will give a restaurant a second chance but not this time.",

I've been to Rokerij twice now and both times left fat and happy. and buzzed.   I dined at Rokerij on Sunday evening; it was a \"Saves the Day\" moment because the first choice restaurant fell through and Dottsy was starving and reaching for my throat. We booked it to Rokerij and sat at the sexy copper bar, ready to partake in some small plate action. As everyone has mentioned, the happy hour deals are for the bar only, between 4-6PM. They are running a new wine promotion too: Sunday, Monday and Tuesday, all bottles are 50% off. Yay! I ordered all the seafood plates: mushrooms stuffed with crab, ceviche, ahi tuna w/ wasabi, and crab tostadas. With the Long Boat Sauvignon Blanc in hand I was in heaven.   I like that the bar is dark and cozy, though I noticed a light was actually out above me, making it near impossible to see my menu. The Happy Hour deal rocks, but it does make me sad not to be able to sit in those comfy leather chairs by the fire sipping wine and stuffing my face on ultra-cheap eats.   Rokerij is a solid performer, and probably deserves that 5th star, but I'm holding off until I finally dine in the main restaurant and enjoy one of their delicious sounding entrees.",

Richardson's is her favorite restaurant.  I thought it might cheer her up to send her some carne adovada and green chili potatoes.  I called yesterday and Tawny (sp?) took my order over the phone, agreeing to freeze the food overnight and have it ready for me to pick up today.    As I was waiting for her to get my order, I started chatting with Richardson (the owner, obviously) and told him where I was going to send it and what it's for, etc.  Tawny came back and very apologetically told me that the chef forgot to freeze my order and that it wouldn't be ready today.  When Richardson heard that, he had her take down my friend's address and said they would ship it via FedEx to her AND pick up the cost of shipping.  Just when I thought it couldn't get better than that, he also offered to pick up the cost of my order AND throw in a few extra entrees to last her and her family longer!!!!  He told her to say that \"Richardson sends his best wishes for a speedy recovery\".  I just about started crying right there, this was so above and beyond anything I could have ever expected.  Richardson, thank you.  I have been a loyal customer for years but now you have really outdone yourself.  I recommend this restaurant and Dick's Hideaway to everyone I know.  If you haven't tried it, what are you waiting for?!!",

Lucky for me, I think this may soon become my favorite happy hour place in Phoenix. The cellar was really intimate and cozy. I actually have no idea what the upstairs restaurant looks like. There was a confusing fireplace downstairs which is perplexing when you come in from the 100+ degree heat. It definitely made the ambiance more intimate and I don't even remember feeling the heat inside.  The menu was really awesome, and I had a lot of trouble deciding which happy hour appetizer to choose. I decided on two which ended up being more than too much food. The ceviche was all white fish, and sweeter than I typically like, but it was definitely fresh. The steak tartare was also very fresh. I only wish the bread was sliced a bit thinner. The beer selection was not too bad at all. They have Chimay on tap, and Hoeegarden in the bottle which is all I need. For the amount of food I ate, and the beers I drank, the price was really affordable as well.  I also really enjoyed the prompt, and friendly service. I will be visiting this place pretty often, and hopefully with one or two friends. The cellar is not really friendly for large groups.",

    "text": "If you're never been to the Rokerij in North Central Phoenix, you're missing out. The tiny restaurant is housed in, literally, a cool old stone house. I hadn't been for a year or so and ventured over last weekend to visit their bar, which, it should be noted, is actually underneath the restaurant (read: basement bar; yes, I know finding a basement in Arizona is rare). The atmosphere couldn't be more charming - picture dark and cozy, a long bar, several couches, and a crackling fireplace with leather armchairs.   Now to the best part - half off wine bottles on Sundays. For all of you wine lovers out there, you know that scoring a bottle for half price is a treat. To make things even better, there wasn't a bottle on the basic wine list over $50, meaning that you can buy a great bottle for less than the cost of a cheap pair of heels. Let's consider the options here - a pair of cheap shoes that will inevitably hurt and be worn twice, or a bottle of wine? Clearly the wine is the best choice. It should also be noted that the half off applies to the reserve wine list, another unusual perk of this hidden treasure.  The fabulous wine discounts are made even better by the Rokerij's $5 small plates. These are slightly larger than standard tapas, and you'll find everything from sweet and sour short ribs and bacon wrapped scallops to my favorite, king crab tostada bites. Order a few to share - you're sure to find something on their rather extensive menu of choices.   The bartenders were friendly and knowledgeable, making a few recommendations and chatting as appropriate, but not excessively. This is truly a great local hang out. I made a note to myself, upon leaving, that I needed to head back sooner rather than later. I've been thinking about it all week, so perhaps another Sunday evening Rokerij adventure is on the horizon!",

    "text": "Heading out a bit late, I brought my dining companion to Dick's Hideaway, only to find that their kitchen closes earlier than I remembered, but they quickly invited us to go to the Rokerij, just about a block north, with the same menu. OK, good plan.  At the Rokerij, we were directed downstairs, and what a lovely surprise. Cozy, intimate, and Incubus on the speakers. We sat at the bar and Ashley took very good care of us. Stella on tap - bonus for my dining companion. Iced tea for me with a generous slice of lemon (just the way I like it) didn't go empty. Thanks Ashley!  We weren't particularly ravenous, so we decided to share - spinach salad (our instinct but also Ashley's recommendation) and the New Mexican Platter (green chile). This was just about the perfect choice for both of us.  I have to say I was impressed with the salad. I'm seldom impressed with salads. I dated a chef who made spectacular salads at home. So yeah, this one was amazing. Even without added chicken or blackened shrimp. The Menu just says \"spinach salad\" what it doesn't say is: with green, red and yellow bell peppers, red onion, tomatoes, sliced fresh jalapenos, feta cheese and bacon shallot vinaigrette (french vinaigrette I think - with balsamic instead of red wine - nice!!! heavy on the mustard and light on the honey) perfection as far as I'm concerned. Just a little fresh cracked black pepper made it even better.  The Entree arrived at the perfect time, and we quickly dove in. Perhaps a bit too quickly as the food was piping hot (not a bad thing). Now I claim to be a wimp about spicy food (especially chiles) but this dish stayed right at the edge of what I can handle, heat wise, and didn't push me over the edge. The flavors were amazing. A great sampler with a tamale, relleno and a chicken burro (heavy on the cheese - yum). Even my dining companion who likes things spicy agreed that there was good heat but tons of flavor (I think the hatch green chile surprised him). I had a great taste experience, trying a little of everything and there was still some left over, which Ashley had boxed for us. Value for the price - absolutely!",

    "text": "Rokerij is worth the hype. We popped in last week for a late bite and left super happy. We scored a few seats at the bar, the place was SUPER crowded (which is a good sign on a Wednesday). I started with a beer called Banana Bread, which was awesome. Wifey had a glass of wine, but I can't remember what it was. We couldn't decide on what we wnated so we ended up splitting the entree of Blackened Salmon with Apple/Chipotle chutney and some potatoes. We also got three of the small Plates: mini reuben, crispy calamari and cilantro rubbed grilled shrimp. All the food was awesome. The salmon was cooked perfectly, although i think I would have liked the chutney on the side, but that's small fries. The calamari was cooked perfectly, the shrimp were awesome (although the bed of rice it came on was meh), and the mini reubens were great as well. I was super excited to try it, and it delivered. Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "Last Sunday my family and I came in to have dinner for a celebration. There were 6 of us not including my infant son who was apparently unwelcome from the start. Upon arrival we checked in with the hostess and the first thing she said to us was \"we don't have high chairs\". Hi I'm great thanks for asking.... we decide to sit down anyway since we were meeting the rest of our group there. As we sit down our very rude hostess gives us 2 menus which would be great except there's four of us currently being seated and 2 that have yet to arrive. The waitress goes around the table taking drink orders and completely skips my husbands and walks away. We tried to call her and wave her down but she was gone before we knew it. At this point we decided that the evening was better off at another restaurant and we hadn't even gotten our drinks yet, yikes. As we begun to walk out, my husband holding my son leading the way, the snarky hostess irrelevantly informs him that they don't have changing tables. She obviously thought he was taking my son to the restroom but what we were really doing was going somewhere else who's service was up to par with a Denny's. I have dined here before and the food is good, not great but good, and I can assure you the snobbish attitude is not fitting for the quality of the meal. The entry level staff must find themselves to be pretty special.",

Have met lots of friends here and they end up loving it and bring other friends.    Our favorite thing to do is go for happy hour and smaple a bunch of the apps.  Have had a full dinner a few times and have comepletly enjoyed every meal.  I don't think we have had better seafood anywhere else in PHX.  Still want to try the monstrous ribeye they offer.  We usually head down into the cellar( where we promptly lose cell phone service..if you are expecting a call, good luck!).  Upstairs is very nice, but the real people watching is downstairs. Downstairs gets VERY busy.  The only thing we have not done yet at the Rokerij is the late night happy hour....maybe this week!",

    "text": "A few former co-workers and I decided to get together for happy hour on a Friday evening after work, I suggested we meet at The Rokerij, since none of us had tried it before.  There were to be 4 people total in our party, and I arrived at the same time as one of my friends.  We walked into the main bar area, and were greeted by a short elderly woman.  We told her we were there for happy hour and there would be 4 people in our party, and she pointed to the bar, and told us to sit \"over that way\".  We walked over and not seeing more than 2 empty bar stools we took a seat at one of the side half circle booths (which were all empty).  About 3 minutes later the elderly woman came over and rudely told us \"we were NOT supposed to sit there, she TOLD us to sit at the bar, and now she would have to find us a table to sit at, and that we were not allowed to just sit wherever we wanted.\"  Looking around, the tables themselves all appeared to be empty, but okay, we figured maybe she was sitting people in another area of the restaurant.  She came back and insisted we HAD to move tables, and to follow her.  She proceeded to sit us at the booth RIGHT NEXT to where we were seated.  Literally one booth over.  No differences in the booths, nor were there any people in line waiting.  We were kind of annoyed but fine, whatever.  Our 3rd friend showed up and explained that the 4th in our party wasn't able to make it.  We were sitting and talking for about 10 minutes, when again the elderly woman approached us and said to me \"I thought you said you had a party of 4 people\".  I just looked at her aghast and said, we DID, 1 person canceled.  She pursed her lips together and huffed away.  We asked our waitress about happy hour, and were told that happy hour is only for patrons seated at the high bar itself - not patrons \"in the bar area\".  But we were welcome to \"run downstairs in the next 5 minutes before it ends to see if we can find seats there\".    We were fairly annoyed by this point, but it had been awhile since we'd seen each other so we decided to make the best of it.  The food was \"okay\" - but over priced.  (We ordered 3 small plates to split, and all left hungrier than when we had arrived).  So when it came time to leave, I took the bill (which was around $40), and gave them my debit card.  When they returned the signed slip to me, I had the itemized bill showing $41, and a debit receipt for a $73 charge on my card.  I grabbed a waiter and asked why I was charged $73 for a $40 bill, and he promised he would correct it.  5 minutes later, they brought me a debit receipt for the $40 charge - nothing regarding the original $73 I had been charged.  I asked for confirmation that the $73 charge would be refunded, and was told \"we didn't print out any slips\".  So I told them \"Bring me the original receipt you expected me to sign then\".  At that point the manager (at least I think he was, he never actually said WHO he was) came over with the original $73 slip with his name and phone number on it.  He told me - here this is my cell phone number you can call if there any problems.  I said that's fine, but this doesn't state anywhere that I should be refunded the $73 I was charged and that is now showing out of my bank account.  He then proceeded to take his cell phone out of his pocket and wave it at me (several times) and state \"that's my cell number - if you have problems - call me\".  I said again,  \"I want it IN WRITING that these charges are NOT supposed to be on my account\".  Your cell number does NOTHING for me.  I am currently showing I have $110 out of my checking account for a $40 bar tab.  After I specifically asked him \"are you refusing to sign the tab stating that I am due this money back?\" he grabbed the receipt from me and wrote a note on it, tossed it on the table  and walked away.  At no point did ANYONE apologize for charging me $73 MORE than I should have been charged.  No one apologized for any of the inconvenience, frustrations and rudeness of any of the employees.  Oh - and as far as the booth seating - NOT ONE BOOTH was filled the entire time we were there.  INCLUDING the original booth we sat in, that the hostess INSISTED we had to vacate.  It was by FAR the WORST restaurant experience I have EVER had.  Not only was the hostess rude, the MANAGER was absolutely insulting.   If this is how they treat customers, I will take my money elsewhere.  I suggest  anyone thinking of eating at ANY of their restaurants, to do the same.",

I tried the mexican sampler with the chili relleno being my favorite but it was all real good. Definitely going back (with reservations) and trying some of the American fare next time. A little on the pricey side but they feed you well ( having my left overs for dinner) & the food is near excellent.  My only complaint is the lighting,  weird rose colored flood lights makes it very hard to see & if you get seated in the wrong place its like being on a stage with one of those lights blasting down on you.  But a great place for a date!",

While packed after work hours, it's worth the wait, even if you just get a seat at the bar.  The ceviche is a good snack while bellied up the bar, but almost like a salsa dip vs most other ceviche's I've had.  The Surf and Turf has to be the best value on the menu, if you're a business dinner or casual night in Central Phoenix the Rokerji is a can't miss.",

I sent it back to be fired again and when it was returned it was seared on the outside but still completely raw on the inside.  Pork + raw = trichinosis.  I don't want worms.  Our server was very attentive however and recommended that it be comped to the manager.  The manager came over and mentioned that they would take care of the pork chop, but he seemed kind of put out by it.  No apology whatsoever.  I left a huge raw chop sitting on the table.  This service is atypical, but after waiting kind of long for the food, you think it would have been cooked enough.",

    "text": "In all my years in the valley, last night was my first opportunity to experience this little gem on the 16th street corridor.  We opted for the downstairs bar; fortunately the four of us were able to find seating in a booth; it's rather intimate and tiny down there.  The ambiance downstairs was very dark and quiet with candlelit tables (not in a creepy way; it was just very serene).  Our group had just finished an outing at Moon Valley Golf and we were famished.  Thankfully, the portions here are hefty.  Brittney was our lovely server; just a spectacular woman in every facet.  We had the cheese tray, which was superb.  I especially loved the liverwurst that accompanied.  You don't see that around town as much.  Also, the fresh artichoke dip was one of the best I've ever had.  I think she mentioned it was made with fresh artichokes rather than the canned hearts.  If that's the case, then BRAVO.  It really made a difference - noticeably more flavorful than many I've had in town.  I and another in our party had the Niman burger (Niman is a very cared-for brand of beef, and it's worth every penny).  It was cooked perfectly with the flavor I expect when ordering Niman beef - I mean SO good.  Ms. Brittney obliged my request for extra mushrooms and caramelized onions.  I know my friend's impression of the burger was the same.  I can honestly say the fries could be better.  I realize I'm splitting hairs here; it's just that they seemed very basic.  However, probably not a ton of french fries being served at this finer restaurant.  My boss had the salmon special; he doesn't talk much, but I can tell he enjoyed it thoroughly.  Brittney also alerted us to a special appetizer - the white asparagus.  It was delicious - white asparagus has less of a \"grassy\" taste - milder in flavor yet just as nutritious.  Her selling point was amusing:  \"c'mon guys, it's healthy.\"  :)  Yeah, healthy - yet served with Hollandaise sauce and diced bacon! lol.   Finally, our last member of the party had the prime rib sandwich - which after seeing I wanted!  Looked to be an ample portion of beef.    To recap: ambiance = dark and relaxing.  Cell service is nil downstairs, so enjoy your time interacting with your group!   seating = not ample, don't bring a huge group downstairs.  Extraordinarily comfortable booth. food = grade A  Brittney = A+  :) - even though she teased me because I was having trouble finishing my HUGE burger.    Thank you for an thoroughly enjoyable post golf dining experience.  Chris G.",

    "text": "Wow!  What a happy hour!  The food here is incredible and during happy hour all the small plates are only $5 each!  This gave us an opportunity, over a few visits, to try almost everything on the small plate menu.  The first time we were there, we ordered the bacon-wrapped shrimp, the steak skewers and the brie mushroom toast.  For two people this was a meal in itself!  We were full by the end.    The bacon wrapped scallops, the tenderloin toast and the oysters were ordered on the next trip.  Thinking this couldn't nearly be enough food, we ordered the chicken tacos too.  The oysters Rokerij were incredible!  I'm not a big fan of oysters - in fact, can't eat them unless they are covered with lots of gooey stuff.  These were a step above Rockefeller!  The bacon-wrapped scallops and the shrimp both are served with three different sauces on the plate.  It would be best if you tried all three.  My favorite is the spicy red sauce.  They are all very good and everything tastes better with bacon!  The chicken tacos were not my favorite.  There was a funky taste to them that I can't pinpoint.  I'm not against trying them again...  The bartenders are great!  Can't beat the service here (at least in the downstairs bar).  Happy Hour is only from 3pm to 6pm, which makes it hard to get there after working until 5pm, and prices are only good if you are sitting at one of the bars (there is one upstairs and one downstairs).  The bartenders upstairs are attentive and for the most part friendly but not nearly as good as the bartenders downstairs.  They make you feel at home and will do everything to try to accommodate you and your party.  The new Richardson's is opening soon next door and we are looking forward to trying that.  But our heart is with Rokerij.",

The prime rib was good... halibut was not that fresh tasting (disappointing since the \"knowledgeable\" server suggested it). The green chili potato .... hmmm.  Well, if you think an uncooked, crunchy pepper the size of a jalapeno filled with a couple of tablespoons of paprika laden mashed potatoes is divine ... then you would be in the right place .  Me? Not so much.  The salad was fine - but then again, you really have to suck to screw up a salad.  The kicker was when I ordered a glass of Chardonnay... then the server returned with a Pinot Noir ....    We took a couple from out of town who were here on their anniversary.  I told the host when I called to check on the reservation (I made it thru Open Table) and then told the host again when we arrived.  They did absolutely nothing with this information but yet I saw some other table get the special acknowledgement.  What a disappointment, all around.    Would I go back?  Dunno.... There are many other places here in the valley that we need to experience prior to ever giving these folks our hard-earned casheroo....",

    "text": "I feel compelled to write my first Yelp review after our 2nd attempt at dining at the Rokerij. Both times, we spent the majority of our time waiting to be seated. The first time we went was in October of 2010 and for our 5th wedding anniversary. They don't let you make reservations for less than 4 people, so we showed up at 7:30. I kid you not, we didn't get seated until TEN P.M. Fair enough though, it was a Saturday night, and the place is pretty tiny. The food was decent enough, from what I remember, but my blood sugar at that point was so low and I was so tired and hungry, I think almost anything would have tasted good at that point.  So, when we heard our friends were coming into town, we decided to give it another shot since they were staying in the area, plus we had the benefit of having enough people to make a reservation. I called 2 weeks in advance to make our reservation. Just to be on the safe side, I called the night before to confirm. They didn't have us down, which in retrospect should have made me wary about what to expect, but the man on the phone was apologetic and reassuring and indicated it was no problem to still get us in at 7pm the next night.  We were running a little late and called right around 7pm to let them know we were on our way. The kid (I use this word purposefully) who picked up said, \"I gave away your reservation an hour ago.\" I said, \"What?\" and he laughed and said, \"Ha, just kidding.\" Really? 1) That's not actually funny and 2) it's totally unprofessional. We arrived at about 7:10, not obscenely late, and he told us he was waiting for our table to finish up and he could seat us. We waited AN HOUR for our RESERVED TABLE. Again, really? While waiting we also saw someone very obviously give him a handful of cash just before taking them to their table.   At this point, the only good part was that we were able to have some wine while waiting, and the person serving us was very accommodating (hmmm...perhaps it was the $50 bottles of wine we ordered). Once seated, our server was very nice (that was the case during our first visit as well). However, soon after we started our appetizers, our out of town guest found a hair in our guacamole. Nice. Other than that (if you can get past it) the food overall was good but not great. Definitely not worth all the hassle and waiting.  The ambiance is great, and it's a unique little place which is hard to find in the greater Phoenix area. And it's why we chose to bring our friends there. However, I would never, ever bring anyone back here because it was truly, really embarrassing to bring them to fairly pricey restaurant for a really very mediocre, bordering on bad, experience.",

LOVE the bar downstairs...  Small plates is a big thing in DC, where I lived for a bit, so I am always excited when I see it on a menu anywhere here... and done right.. Not just some hummus or dip tossed on a plate and one calls it a 'tapas':-) I didnt have any of the small plates tonight... I was full truly from the pre dinner events.. BUT had to have the pork enchiladas.. and everyone else had the adovada... Mine was awesome, but I had order envy, bc I tasted theirs and it was a firey delight... wanted it and couldnt steal and get away with it... not in this crowd, at least. The waiter was pleasant.. He didnt really know how to pair the wine with the carne adovada... but suggested a couple and brought samples.. cool beans.. Euro style, as it should be done before you buy a bottle. Be warned...the chile is HOT... and if you order..it is yours... warning on menu.. Score one for this restaurant... I love it..",

As always it was my job to scout out a place (I usually do so well thanks to y'all on yelp!).  I was really excited when we pulled up because it was a free standing building that appeared to have a bit of history!  We walked in to a VERY dark bar.  I think that during another occasion this would be fine but a family dinner...ehh.  (Keep this in mind...)  Thank god we had a reservation because there was only 1 server on the floor and we sure knew it.  She reminded us every moment as we stared at our empty water and drink glasses.  Awful service!  As for the food, they serve small plates, salads, entrees, etc...  A wonderful menu with specials posted on the wall that I wish I knew about.  Our server spit them off so fast that we believed she was on some kind of drug!  I went with the ahi salad which was a slip I think.  The tuna was good but lacking some flavor.  The fish was served on a bed of greens but no other veggies at all.  I love a good salad and any good salad has more than 2 ingredients...  Everyone else actually seemed pretty pleased with their food but this could have been because we did not get served until 1.5 hours after our reservation.  Bad service okay food bad service  Won't be back... sad",

I can't think of a better way to spend a winter evening then being posted up in the club chairs around the fire there with a vodka and soda in hand and a garlic plate on the hearth. We need more places like the Rokerij in Phoenix!",

There was $5 dollar hot plates and red/whites per glass.  We ordered beef tenderloins skewers and briskets as well calamari. Calamari came out first and it was pretty good. Had a mixture of big and small pieces. Have had better but was worth what we paid for.  Then came out the skewers in 4 sauces. Wow! I mixed the sauces as if I was Picasso ready to paint with my tenderloin skewer (especially the hollaindaise tasting one it was so delicious) and devoured the beef paint brush almost instantly.  After that we were greeted with the beef briskets - it was little pieces of bread with a piece of beef tenderloin and brie cheese melted on top. To die for is an understatement! We had to order one more hot plate as to how amazing everything was as well as the cheap price. Ordered the tacos and took 1 of each. My bf ate the carne avodo and fish, I had the beef and chicken. The beef had an amazing kick of spices in the mouth and the chicken had this unexplainable tasting sauce that was decadent!  After the 4 hot plates we did not have enough room for a sip of water let alone dessert! We closed out and it was a cheap but absolutely delicious good lunch.",

    "text": "Let me make myself clear, the only reason I am giving the Rokerij 4 stars is because of the downstairs.  This downstairs bar area of the restaurant has a taverny-old world-European feel to it.  It is usually crowded, but despite the crowd, the atmosphere still feels fairly intimate.  They have a decent wine list with friendly bartenders.  I enjoyed a nice Malbec which seems to be hard to come by here in Phoenix.  This is a great place to relax with a couple of friends or a casual date, but not a good place for large groups.  As for the upstairs dining room...I was not impressed.  The restaurant attempts to keep a similar theme from the downstairs, but in a more fine dining way.  It doesn't really work.  I am a small person and the booths swallowed me up because they are so huge.  The booths have pillows but there is just something weird about sitting on a pillow to reach the table.  I felt like a child but not in a good way.  Our server was great, she was new, but she did a great job.  I can imagine we would have stressed her out a bit more had we been more high maintenance.  The food, well, did not live up to its glory.  Let's just say I wasn't in a hurry to finish my food or willing to take anything home with me.  The food just missed something and was over powered by one particular sauce that left a terrible aftertaste.    To sum things up, check out the basement but avoid the dining room, the whole fine-dining thing is completely overrated.",

The bar was filled with people and HH is only available at the bar top so make sure you snag seats at the bar. The ambiance was cute - rustic, romantic and dark.  My order: two margaritas, artichoke dip, shrimp piri piri, and calamari. The margaritas were delightful and full of alcohol! I was pretty happy after consuming half the glass. The artichoke dip was so gross! I ate two bites and couldn't eat anymore. It tasted old. The shrimp piri piri and calamari were good though.  Overall, check came out to $34 before tip - a little high than other HH places I've been to.Make sure you have cash to tip the valet guy. Not sure if I will be back but glad I came to try it out.",

(The booths have room to seat parties of four to six, depending on the side of the fireplace you're gazing at.)  Dates would be impressed. As would a business partner or your girlfriends. The hushed tones of the dark room encourage whispered conversation. The food and wine has always been impeccably delivered.   The Oysters - just stop. Whatever you're doing can wait. Go. I promise you, your palate will enjoy the menu. I have a few photos up of sliders, scallops wrapped in bacon and artichoke dip. But that is an injustice. Rokerij offers a robust menu.  Happy hour is quite generous. If you're not sure pay attention: Happy hour is *every day* until 6pm. (Reverse HH is 10pm to midnight.) Alas, the True secrets of happy hour are best revealed by calling in. They change often and may not make it to Facebook or their website in time. Visit often and you'll know the inside scoop!  Currently... Wonderful, hearty glasses of wine are poured for 1/2 the normal price. All appetizers are $2-3 off a plate. But you *must* sit at the bar.  The bartenders are well versed in their product knowledge. The table staff are stunning. Visiting here is like visiting dear, close friends. Special note: The space is ADA accessible.   Parking is valet.   Thanks Rokerij!",

You trust some idiot with your car and everything in it and then have to tip him/her for doing something that you could easily do yourself?  Lame.  Second:  You access this basement level bar down a flight of stairs which is lined with stones.  It looks really cool!  The actual bar has a great look as well.  Then you pull out your phone to text your friends to meet you there and the other shoe drops:  NO CELL/DATA SERVICE.  You are in a basement!  The bar has wifi but they are not exactly advertising the password around.  Maybe one of the bartenders will give it to you if you ask.  I didn't try.  The menu is definitely pricey for the food that you get.  I had the pappardelle pasta dish, my wife had the Mako, and we shared the mushroom caps for an appetizer.  All the food tasted good but the mushrooms were COLD!  They also tasted like all they were seasoned with was Sprouts brand Italian dressing.  Which is fine.  But nothing special.  And they should certainly not have been cold.    Expect to spend more than you should for food of this quality.  Cool atmosphere though.  And you will never ever see wider bar stools in your life.  They could fit even the mightiest caboose upon them.",

Check with your waiter/waitress first if you want to know if it is available or not.   Service: our waitress was super friendly and came by to check up on his very often. 100% great service.   Food: I ordered the roasted duck dish and it was absolutely delicious. The duck meat is juicy and it blends in very good with the sauce. The creme brulee was amazing.

We were immediately greeted at the entrance and led downstairs into the bar area to an exclusive booth that was extremely intimate.  Truly about as private as it gets - highly recommend for dating (its at the end of the bar set back the from the main wall so if you situate yourselves in a certain way - NO ONE can see you except the bartender).    Service was excellent and personable.  I ordered from the \"special\" menu - a trinity of flavors: the medallions were cooked perfectly and wonderfully flavorful, I enjoyed the bacon wrapped shrimp, the Mexican sausage was ok (more like breakfast sausage on beans).  My guest really enjoyed her meal.  I highly recommend the spot we had downstairs.  I met some of the staff behind the bar upstairs before we left - great guys.  All around great experience.

    "text": "The atmosphere and the vibe of this place is great. Its very cozy, dimly lit, and the perfect spot for a romantic date. However, I went here after the gym with a girlfriend and still had a blast! We shared the toasted brie, crab empanadas, and the ceviche with a few glass of sauv. blanc. The crab empanadas were UH-MAZING!!!!! This is a total must, do not pass this dish up.  I wanted to give this place 5 stars but I had to knock the stars due to poor service and our waitress irritability.   My girlfriend and I went in specifically during the happy hour yet our waitress had a hard time remembering when happy hour was or even where the menus were. It took her about 10 minutes to come and take our order.... once she managed to locate the happy hour menus. We enjoyed our wine and food but we didn't see her again until she brought the check. Normally, this is perfectly fine since we're wrapped up in conversation however we did want to order more food. Guess that wasn't an option.   Another down fall was the workers ability to ruin the atmosphere with the constant personal conversation. Every 5 minutes someone was leaving for the night and just had to say good bye to every other worker, making us feel like we needed to leave soon. We just felt rushed by it all.",

Every time I'm told that there is no availability for a table for 2, but come in anyway and we may be able to get you in.  So, you show up, sit at the bar for an hour with hopes of a table only to be told sorry, you can eat at the bar.  Apparently only parties of 4 or more are blessed with a table and couples are second class citizens. Very unfair and insulting.",

Stellar appetizers and wood fired pizzas with craft cocktails and interior walls covered with horizontal wine bottles.  Dark sexy ambiance with a fire place... Stop it!  Double date night after a theater engagement on a Sunday.  We sit upstairs in a both by the fireplace and enjoy some margaritas, wine, and Guinness in our group.  Since we were dining late, we skip the appetizers but really they were so tempting... Roasted garlic platter?  I want.  They have a chalkboard with fish & steak specials that could stand alone as the menu.    I opt for a special: fresh fish trio of salmon, sea bass, and swordfish (I believe.) Beyond!  Each piece is nicely seasoned. I requested mainly grilled preparations though one was sauteed in butter and served traditionally with a white wine sauce.  Each piece had its own well prepared & seasoned sauce.  I enjoyed the green and red sauces most.  For your side you can choose a starch or veggie.  Seems as if they have a wide side selection.  I choose beets which are fresh & delicious!  Grilled asparagus or corn sounded yummy as well.  Our table shared a bottle of wine for dessert and enjoyed a relaxed not rushed ambiance.    The only feedback I would include is it's unprofessional to call your clients \"dear\" or other terms of endearment... Even if they do look young.  Despite this rookie mistake, our service was perfectly paced and otherwise fine.",

The filet mignon came with hollandaise sauce, having eaten the sauce for breakfast, I didn't want it for dinner so I was going to get a seafood dish if they couldn't hold the sauce.  The bartender said he would have it put on the side.  When it comes out, the meat is covered in hollandaise. A server or bar back drops off the plate and they are gone before I turn around. I ate my broccoli while I waited for the bartender to surface, I wanted to point out my steak and his error.  My friend had nearly finished his meal while I waited.  I finally gave in and ate it otherwise I might still be there right now waiting for him.  It was delicious but it's hard to enjoy good food when the service sucks.",

    "text": "Unlike most eateries in Phoenix where often I take on a \"willfully blind\" approach to service/ambiance,etc, I actually felt as though I was not in Phoenix the moment I arrived in this dark toned jewel of a restaurant.  Simply put, the dining experience exceeded any expectations I had for the evening.  Gorgeous stemware perfectly complimented a very understated and meticulously considered wine list.  Upon the arrival of my main course, I suffered through slobber fits while awaiting the rest of the tables food (momentary wait).  The Surf n Turf (dungeness crab enchiladas, bacon wrapped jumbo prawns, delicious mashed potatoes, and perfectly cooked piece of beef - $29) - was served on girthy plates framed by an artfully presented dish.  Healthy portions, overflowing flavor and subtly attentive service catapulted the Rokerij to the top of my Valley favorites.  If a single dining experience could suggest of more delectably similar experiences to come, this was it!  Every meal at the table was equally as well received as mine and I don't think you'll find a better salad than the Rokerij concoction we partook in prior to the main course...simply put, a superlative dining experience from start to finish!    I can't wait to return for their \"small plate\" and $7 glass of wine happy hour.",

It doesn't matter if you're seated downstairs in the cozy, darkly lit bar or upstairs where you can watch the chef's make quick work of your order in the open kitchen, you can expect friendly service, a fantastic wine list, and very tasty food.  I also love that I can walk into this restaurant and never feel over or under dressed whether I'm wearing flip flops and jeans or my cutest party dress.  The prime rib has been my favorite lately.  My boyfriend and I generally split it and are both very satisfied by the huge portion!  Their soups and sides are all to die for and their veggie selection is generally very fresh..  I'm a fan of the brocollini and asparagus.  I enjoy taking out of town guests to this little neighborhood gem and love that they serve food later than most of the North Central corridor restaurants.  Hats off to you, Rokerij, keep up the good work!",

I visited last Sunday and our service was friendly, but it didn't make up for the poor delivery of food and the problem with solving issues that we had. I have only had the small plates from Rokerij. This trip I decided to try some of their \"New Mexican\" offerings.  My appetizer order, which was specifically stated to be an appetizer, not an entree came with my entree. Considering the appetizer did not even have to be cooked (steak tartare), that's unacceptable. When I commented on it I got a \"Ugh, I know, right?\" Um...really? My entree which was the Rokerij sampler was meh. The best part of the dish was the benedict. The enchiladas were bland and plain old mush.  I had dinner with my best friend Amber, and my good friend Ayesha. Ayesha had me sample her enchiladas as she has specifically asked that she not be served pork. I bit into a bite of pork enchilada off of Ayesha's plate. When the waiter was flagged down, he said \"Hm, not sure what to do about this.\" Really?? Luckily, before I went off like a powder keg, he offered to remake them. He didn't comp anything for the obvious mistakes that were made. I hope he realized that there were some boo-boos made when he saw his tip was so small. I hope to give back the star I just took away, but they're going to have to wow me to do that. It's too bad that this trip was so disappointing.",

    "text": "Sadly, I am forced to agree with Leslie M who wrote on 4/10. This was one of my favorite places to visit, to introduce newcomers to, treat family and friends, and for a time I'd visit once every two months or so. My previous three visits have not gone so well; I'll relate my latest visit which took place just over a week ago. A friend attempted to make reservations for two on a Thursday. He was told that due to a policy change by  Richardson, a reservation for two on a Thursday could no longer be taken, as there was disappointment that their business for tables of 4 or more were suffering. Okay, I can understand, business decisions have to be made, but cut your nose off to spite your face? However, the woman that answered the phone let us know there should be no problem getting a table. I was seated shortly before my friend arrived so I had a chance to look over the menu. To my surprise, some changes have been made. First, a salad choice (and they're all very typically very yummy), anyway, a choice is no longer offered. Instead, the house salad is offered at $4 with the entree purchase. Next, a statement is now printed across the top of the menu letting the patron know \"you order it, you bought it\"...is this REALLY necessary? While the server and busboy were friendly and helpful (my water glass was never empty), my $4 house salad arrived about 90 seconds before our entrees did. Oh, the accompanying bread was hard as stone and arrived with my salad, while an attentive server should have brought it along just after our drinks were served, as my dinner partner hadn't ordered a salad. Oh, my friend, he's typically a big fan of the Steak Rokerij, and absolutely loves the crab/hollandaise sauce mixture. As normal, he asked for more sauce. On this visit, we found $10 added to the check for that request. We found that unusual for Rokerij. Things have certainly changed. I was willing to overlook these changes, after all, the economy is poor these days. I excused myself to use the men's room. After all, we did have Chimay (Rokerij has never had a wide beer selection). I found the towel basket to be so PACKED with paper-towels, I couldn't get one out of the basket, which is on a vanity so small, when you turn the water on, the towels become soaked. This explains the stained, linen towel basket liner...the stains were grays and greens. Overall, I feel that these things add up to failing to pay attention to detail. It's a shame really. I really hope the best for Richardson and hope Rokerij can return to it's former self.",

    "text": "Ok, I've been a big Richardson's fan since back in the day and love the Rokerij as well. I've been going there since literally before it opened (the dry run) and have always had good food and service that ranges from acceptable to great with one notable exception. On that occasion I called and complained just to make the manger aware and she made it right and made it impossible to complain any further. This is an insider place that I tell and take out of town business guests to as well. Although I liked it more before the remodel when it was a bit more formal and different from Richardson's. Now the menus are much more similar but Rokerij has tapas items, I think they call small plates almost all of which are awesome, especially the Brie Toasts with Steak. I remember when they first changed the menu we went in and someone said, \"Wait a minute, this is the same as the damn Richardson's menu\", we looked at each other and said, \"Sweet\" and enjoyed our meals anyway. My cork-dork friends like the wine list and I like the cocktails. The atmosphere is nice but casual, dark wood, big booths, fireplace and etc. they have a decent bar downstairs (and one upstairs as well) where you can also eat if you want to sit in a line at the bar (also three booths and another fireplace with couch and club chairs) but it makes me a bit claustrophobic to be locked in there. Parking is easy with the new lot they added and the place is busy most nights of the week so if you are going with a group call ahead.",

The dirty Stoli martini was even better....oh how I love a good martini!  Then he took the reigns with our drinks after that.  My friend had a chocolate martini and then something that tasted like a raspberry creamsicle.  Both were sweet but delicious!  And I had a blueberry lemondrop and an appletini.  Don't judge me on the appletini!  I just wanted a green drink!  They were all good and we were in reverse happy hour so we got the tenderloin skewers and bacon wrapped scallops for $5 a plate.  They were huge bites for only $5 a piece and I loved the sauces that came with it.  I'm coming back for sure, but only if the bartender is there!  I love the drinks!

I went with my Dad, who was in town for the day. Bonus points for having a few plasmas playing the ballgame, but not too many. Classy and understated all the way. New Mexico themed fare, whatever that is. It is basically a seafood/steakhouse with a bit of extra spicy kick to everything. I went with the Pasta and Grill, which consisted of a small medallion of steak, some chicken (with the added kick) and swordfish with a spicy chutney over the top. Served over beans and rice, with half the plate offering up some pretty damned tasty penne. Went great with a glass of wine, and not too much damage on the wallet. We got out of there for $60 plus a tip. One of my new favorites. Interesting note; my Dad said if I didn't pull him in here, he would have \"driven right by the place and not even knew it was there\". On the way out, a busboy stopped my Dad and asked \"do I know you from somewhere?\" My Dad said he was the guy from the KYOT voice overs, and gave his best \"Kay-why-oooooh-teeeeee\". Nice.",

I got the blue corn smoked turkey enchiladas Xmas style, and their red chile is completely heads and shoulders above their green (although I am spoiled for green chile as I am in NM 10-15 times a year).  The pork adobada looked really good, and the beef tenderloin with crab hollandaise got rave reviews (the last diner ordered a salad, so no credit either way).

Nice moderate list to begin with gets downright cheap at 1/2 price, Altos Malbec and Shegesio zin nice. Wait staff took a bit to get to us but was great throughout. Starters were asavado tacos, brie, turkey relleno,,all were very good. I had the blackened pork tenerloins with apple chile sauce,,amazing,,sweet with a hint of heat but overall amazing.  Others had cheese steak, mixed fish grill, Rokerij steak and enchiladas,,all very good. The inside really is a mostly bar with great food so be prepared for some rowdy locals but this place is killer on teh food side and you can go for a 4 star meal in jeans which is what I'm always looking for,,,just a great spot that I will return to in Phoenix any day!",

    "text": "I had my first experience at Rokerij last night, and I was not impressed by many things.  Service was lacking in the amount of time it took the server to take care of both the drinks, and the order.  My friend did not care for what she ordered, which happens sometimes, and told the server (the server became obviously annoyed) about her dissatisfaction.  The server didn't even ask if she wanted anything else to eat, she just removed the food.  The food indeed did show up on the bill.  Mind you, my friend had eaten perhaps 2 bites of the food.  When we asked the manager why she was still being charged, he said that there was nothing wrong with the food so he wasn't going to remove the charge.  I have eaten at dive bars with better customer service from both the servers and the manager.  I have also eaten at much better establishments where they would never have treated any customer in that manner.  It was a horrible experience overall, and my friend paid $27 for something she didn't even eat.  The manager actually tried to give her the food, which for some reason someone had boxed up.  She didn't ask for it to be boxed up.  She didn't like it, didn't want to eat it, and had no intentions of taking something home that she was not going to ever eat.  Seriously.  I ate off of the Richardson's menu, which is probably Rokerij's only saving grace.  I will never go there again.  I will also never advise anyone else to eat there either.  It is of no worth if other things on the menu are fine if the manager himself is in the practice of treating customers poorly.",

My salmon was mediocre (I'd rate it a 5 on a scale of 1 - 10).  My husbands enchilada was burnt.  Our friend's dinners was not very good either....fish was dry.  Plus....when we made reservations we asked if they were still offrring the 50% off wine and they told us Mondays only.  I asked if we could make a reservation on Monday, Labor Day and they said yes!  After we ordered 2 expensive bottles of wine, they told us it wasn't 50% off because it was a holiday.  I explained that I specifically asked about the wine when I made the reservation, but both our waiter and the manager said \"there is nothing we can do because it's already in the computer\".  I wrote a letter to the owner and the general manager and they have not given me the courtesy of a reply.  I WILL NEVER GO TO THE ROKERIJ AGAIN, OR ANY RESTAURANT OWNED BY RICHARDSONS!",

After waiting 30 minutes we asked that they check on it.  They said they would.  10 minutes later no one said anything.  We asked again and again they smiled walked away and didn't come back.  It took 55 minutes to get stuffed mushrooms.  The manager explained to me that they are made to order and take a long time. I've made stuffed mushrooms, it takes 10 minutes in the oven.  Obviously the order was lost.  No apologies, just an explanation about mushrooms. Can a manager be that clueless about how food is prepared? He made no attempt to turn around our dining experience.  No apologies, no offers of wine why we wait or take the appetizer off the bill.  Once dinner was served, no one checked on us once to see if everything was ok or we needed something.  The couple next to us sent their steak back twice because it wasn't cooked the way they ordered it.  The grouper I ordered was ok, the vegetables were great.  I will never go back.  I wanted to email them before resorting to yelp, little surprise, there is no contact us on the website.",

We lucked out and got a seat at the bar in the basement.  The basement is one of the coolest places to take a date in town. The atmosphere and wine did not disappoint.  I ordered their caesar salad with shrimp. When asked if I wanted it grilled or blackened, I chose grilled. Sadly when my salad arrived, the shrimp had been blackened and all moisture evaporated from them.  They were like chewy Stretch Armstrongs.  When I pointed this out to the bartender, she simply said, \"that's how it comes.'  I get that not everyone's tastes are the same.  But I cannot think of anyone who would have enjoyed gnawing on these poor little creatures who sat sadly in a bed of lettuce cores and stems.  The brie toast was amazing, so they are capable.  I will only return for drinks and to soak up the atmosphere.  They SO need to fix the quality of their food or at least their service when something like this happens.",

    "text": "\"First we eat, then we do everything else.\"   M.F.K. Fisher  My gods were smiling on us this evening as we had no reservation and only needed a place to gather around a pitcher of vino. My gal and I were escorted downstairs and were given one of their three finest tables, yep, hard to believe.  Having frequented Richardson's, I already was a believer in the New Mexican cuisine, a style of our ancestral Mexican neighbor to the east, who made use of the local chile plant variants and the local animals. A cooking style notably divergent from that of central Mexico, and nearby Native Americans such as the Navajo, Zuni and Ute. At Rokerij it's all about food heritage.  On the menu we ordered skewers 16. Pecan wood grilled chicken, beef tenderloin, shrimp and sausage, with sauces, rice and pinto beans on a tortilla. Plus, New Mexico sausages 12. Four grilled Schreiner jalapeno cilantro pork sausages served over wood oven roasted sweet onions with pinto beans also on a tortilla.  Yes Sir, 12,000 years of hunting, gathering, raising, growing, cooking right here.",

    "text": "We went on a double date the other night to Rokerij.  Funny I'd been wanting to go to Rokerij for a while now, and when we finally pulled up, I realized that I had been before!  (I guess I'm getting old or something and really losing it... I actually had been there once before when I first moved to AZ, not realizing what the name of the place was).  I called to make a reservation a few days before the date and was told they could accommodate our group at upstairs, but not down unless we wanted to wait until 9:00.  Alright then... 7:00 upstairs worked!  We were celebrating our engagement and our friends' being pregnant, and we had the perfect booth; kind of a half circle shape.  Lindsay was our waitress and took good care of us.  The atmosphere is dark but warm and cozy... perfect to walk into on a cold night!  We decided to start with a few of the small plates to start... (both guys in our group are big eaters). They let me choose one of them and I chose the stuffed mushrooms - they are stuffed with crab meat and were delicious.  They also chose the spareribs (which I tasted and were quite tasty) and the bacon wrapped scallops.    For entrees, Jared and I took advantage of the $36 special which included our choice of meet, 2 salads, and 2 side items.  I chose the entrecote and probably would not choose that again.  It's a bone-in ribeye and was way too fatty... we enjoyed our spinach and Rokerij salads and our sides of broccoli and asparagus.  I probably could've just had the small plates and salad and been just fine.  We took home leftover meat for Minnie, so she was a happy dog that night!  Instead of ordering dessert, we walked next-door to DQ - can't go wrong with that!  Overall, I'd say our experience was 3.5 but I'll round up for now because Lindsay was a great waitress and we had fun with our friends.  I'll overlook the fact that one of the bussers spilled steak juice on me when delivering our entree... I won't rush back but I'll keep Rokerij in mind for future gatherings with small groups.",

    "text": "This is an unbelievable place. Supremely unique, surprisingly high quality, and has the most amazing atmosphere of any restaurant in the area.   The grotto bar downstairs, which you access through the stone encased stairwell, is the ultimate downstairs bar in Arizona. From the stamped copper bar top, to the fireplaces, and the dark sexy booths in back, it's the perfect place to rendezvous. Upstairs, you'll find an upscale version of what Richardson's was before it burned. Hardwood floors, adobe circular booths, wine cellar walls, another bar, and a beautiful fire make it a very intriguging dining room. They are users of Pandora Radio, so they have all sorts of variety playing over the airwaves.   The food is fantastic. Some of the highlights are the Rokerij Benedict, an english muffin topped with tenderloin, crab, egg, and jalapeno hollandaise. Try the Surf & Turf if you are truly hungry which is a couple of bacon wrapped shrimp, a crab enchilada, and a tenderloin. Both dishes are incredible, but perhaps not as much as some of the small plates you'll find, like the tenderloin toasts, topped with double creme brie, or the ubiquitous roasted garlic plate. Currently, they are also serving Richardson's menu, and in addition to the dozen or so specials on the chalk board nightly, one could dine here every day for a month and never have a duplicate meal.   Rokerij is a True neighborhood hangout with unique food, friendly people, and an atmosphere you cannot find elsewhere.",

I started with the ceviche which was ok. Then had the ribs over dirty rice which were so very spicy hot. That should have been enough but then we ordered the adovado sliders. My mouth is still burning and I like hot food but this was waaaaay too hot. I was surprised that the waiter didn't warn us about the heat level...he should have. Another customer at the bar saw my eyes tearing up and he said..that's why I only order the bacon wrapped shrimp.  After, I did notice in really fine print at the bottom of the menu something about the heat level of their chillies. I guess I should have paid more attention to the fine print but I still think the bartender/waiter could have said something...maybe - well that dish is very spicy just so you know.    Probably won't go back and I don't like saying that because it is a very cool place. Maybe the way to go is to eat food that isn't smoked and lathered in their hot spicy sauce. Gotta go now and take about 5 more TUMS.",

    "text": "Mmm... just by exiting your car in the teeny tiny parking lot you can smell the smoke of the kitchen doing its thing... like a cartoon character being led by a visual scent you follow it into the restaurant... but make sure to watch your step!  This is where I go to have a American (New Mexican) version of Tapas dining! And if you can help it, grab a bar stool down in the Basement Bar at happy hour to score the deals! I love the cozy ambiance of the entire restaurant, but going down the stairs and into a basement in Phoenix is a rare experience--and this one in particular transports you to another place and time... LOVE IT. It's very romantic and old world feeling. Sometimes I expect a pirate to come down and order a drink!  I like to eat here tapas style, grabbing up the small plates off Rokerij's menu. During happy hour there's a lot of $5 deals but a lot of the un*ed options are too enticing to NOT try. The last time I went I went ALL SURF. Blue Crab Tostadas on the thinnest crisp blue corn tortilla chip I have ever had and the Bacon Wrapped Scallops. And to round out my 2-course small plate meal... I got the GCP... a side that Richardson's restaurants are known for: the infamous Green Chile Potato.   In the past, I have also had the Bacon Wrapped Shrimp... I may like this MORE than the scallops as it is not as subtle a flavor and really mingles perfectly with the bacon.  If you opt for the dining experience on the main level, they have big booth seating and a bar upstairs as well. They also have a big room in back for bigger parties! When dining in that room it feels special somehow. I love the big chalk boards that list all the daily specials... they are really Surf and Turf Specialists with SO MANY choices it's ridiculous... but in a good way! Just wait as the Waiter/Waitress attempts to rattle all of them off for you!  Word of slight caution, because it's New Mexican cuisine, they do like to add heat to their sauces. And a word about sauces... they like to drench dishes in them, so if you don't like that, have them put it on the side for your discretion.  And last, I will leave you with a story you would only get at a restaurant chain that has burning embers in its web address. I was dining with co-workers on a business lunch and one of our party was approached by the waitress with an apologetic look on her face. She told him that she was sorry but that his order fell into the fire in the oven and that she had forgot what it was (The Mahi Mahi Sandwich) and needed to get the order it again. What? Really?! Yes, really! They whipped out his meal part deux quickly after that but I still think that's pretty darn funny and not something you'd hear about just anywhere!",

    "text": "It's an overall great experience. The food is top notch and prepared exactly as it should. And it's almost like visiting two restaurants, not because Richardson's is next door, but due to the fact that there's a cozy basement bar with a different feel than the restaurant on the main floor. I recommend getting drinks early at the bar then coming up out of there to eat. Makes for a good night.  My only recommendation would be to expand the beer list. They have a limited selection of drafts and bottle. Albeit very good ones. But given atmosphere in the basement, which makes me harken back to days at some great Belgian beer bars, I bet they would attract an even bigger patron base by making it more of a craft beer haven. Maybe that's not a good plan for them though. Overall one of the most underrated places in Phoenix for sure.",

I might try this again someday. Maybe on a date or something. The lights were really low and romantic. I personally like it a little brighter so we can see the people around us, but I get the purpose of the dim effect. This place would be nice if you're looking for a fancy dinner with a date.",

Our scrambled eggs were the best part of the meal.  We both had french toast that was covered with raw eggs that made the toast just fall apart.  Mine didn't come with butter or syrup, so we had to request it.  We both took 1-2 bites before giving up, and the pork loin was tuff with no flavor.  My second cup of coffee came with about half-full because they \"ran out of coffee and had to go next door\".  It came with about a full teaspoon of coffee grounds in the bottom of my cup, and I had no water to get the grit out of my teeth since non of us were given water at the table.  Our total bill for the two of us was about $40, and I've had much better meals at Denny's.",

Honestly, Rokerij is near the top of all my lists.  Your experience begins when you head down a flight of stairs into what appears to be a small rock-walled cavern.  There are cozy chairs next to a fireplace if you want to chill with friends, romantic booths hidden away in niches (definitely reserve these in advance if you want one!) and spots at a bar where we witnessed bar staff chatting about patrons casually about life and doing everything that a bartenders do in classy places that they don't in, you know, Scottsdale.  The food is spectacular.  I tried the carne adovada and liked it, but Phoenix is full of good authentic Mexican food.  The star here for me was really the Seared Pecan Trout, which apparently is local from Arizona and wild-caught.  The fish is melt-in-your-mouth buttery with absolutely incredible flavor.  Pair it with the brussel sprouts and a glass of wine for a wonderful (and actually healthy!) meal.  We lucked out and caught a \"half off bottles of wine\" happy hour, but it looks like there's a good selection of cocktails on the menu as well.  10/10 would come again.",

They were able to accommodate us and when we walked through- it was clear it's a very small place with mostly large tables. Looked fun for a group!   They had great happy hour menu- most of the starters were discounted. We had the stuffed jalapenos and calamari. The best part of the night was the surf and turf - filet, bacon wrapped shrimp and two enchiladas!   Check out the bar downstairs as well - so cozy and inviting.

She recommended the trout that one member of my party had that was soooo good.  They don't skimp on the food either.

Bacon wrapped scallops? Yes please. Carne avodava sliders? Hell yeah. Add a glass of red and you've got the perfect date.   I've been here several times for brunch because it's great food and there is NO wait on the weekends.   Their Huevos Rancheros con chorizo are knock-it-out-of-the-park delicious. And so much food that I was able to keep about half of it for breakfast the next day. All those delicious, yet understated, flavors all compliment each other so well. I was graced with a sample of their french toast, and it is pretty amaze also.   Last time I was here, I tried the salmon benedict and was underwhelmed. It needed some sort of kick or maybe a heavy glaze on the salmon because the flavor combos were pretty bland. Since they don't have any hot sauces aside from sriracha, I was outta luck on that front.   On a more positive note, you know it's gonna be a good mimosa when they ask \"Do you want a little bit of orange juice, or a lot orange juice?\" Honey, the mo' champs the better. She nods and says \"I thought so!\" Wine glass sized mimosas = yes.   See you next time, Rokerij.",

Even if you don't have time for lunch brunch or dinner do yourself a favor and at least go underground into the bar set in a Scottish Pub ( I understand they imported it and reconstructed the pub underground with the original Tavern stones).

Just left with a group of friends of mine and here's two more reasons why I won't be returning and neither will my friends...  2 friends ordered the 'midwesterner' on the description it says it includes bacon. Bacon never came on the meal. The server insisted it did not come with bacon even though we showed him the menu to prove it did. After 10 minutes we finally got bacon.  Now it's times to leave and there's 8 of us and we request only 3 checks. We were told \"we can't do separate checks.\" Mind you this was never informed of us on the menu or by our server. I said you can't or you won't? My server said \"we don't, sorry\" so for the next few minutes we had to individually write on the check the amount we wanted out on each card.  I even separated the checks for him to show him what items to put on what cards. He said he couldn't do that because he needed an amount. ARE YOU KIDDING ME?!? I've seen and worked with their system. It's easy as pie to separate checks. Especially with only 3 tabs.   Don't come back to this place. It was hot in 2003 when it first opened. Or maybe it was a few years later when it \"accidentally\" caught fire. Ya know, just like his other 2 restaurants. Must be a coincidence though",

We got there pretty early at 6:15 and now just leaving freakin dinner at 9:15. 3 hours?!? This wasn't a 20 course meal.  Service was horrible. I mean absolutely horrible. Our waiter had no personal skills, ignored our table pretty much throughout the dinner and didnt even check on us ever. I 100% understand when a kitchen is backed up or its busy in the restaurant. Just let us know instead of ignoring us and deliberately walking fast past our table.   They pride themselves on being a steakhouse and the prices are certainly on par with mastro's and steak 44 but place fell way short. Now I was the only one with a bad meal - I ordered the filet but asked for it plain and no bacon wrap. Of course, it came out with bacon on it. Fine, whatever, i'll just take it off.  The entire thing tasted like bacon and not steak. I know i'm the only person who doesnt like bacon in the world but turned the steak into plain piece of crap. Meat was tough.

The waitress took our drink order's immediately and offered us the happy hour menu as it was about to end in 30 minutes.  We ordered the bacon wrapped jalapenos, calamari with chili sauce to start with.  When our drinks were brought out, I must say, they were very good.  If you love strong drinks, this is the place to have them.  Once our calamari arrived, it had a lot of sauce poured on them.  I picked at the calamari that had no sauce and it was cooked perfectly.  Less sauce would make this dish better.  The bacon wrapped jalapenos were good.  Just the right amount of kick.  Once everyone arrived, we ordered dinner.  I had the Prime NY with asparagus and the baked potato.  When my plate arrived it all looked great.  The potato was perfectly cooked and the asparagus was not over cooked.  My steak on the other hand was disappointing.  I could taste the freezer burn, I asked for  medium steak and it was almost well done, it was not tender at all.  You could see the lines in the steak where it had freezer burn.  The table I was sitting at send 3 dishes back and I felt bad sending mine back as well.  Every plate that was sent back was either under cooked or overcooked and one was the wrong plate.  The place was busy with several parties.  Drinks took a while to be served after the 2nd round.  Overall, its ok.  I would come back for drinks and appetizers, not the food.",

We arrived a few minutes before 8:30 and after being given the run around about table options we finally decided to sit at the bar. We were not even very concerned about waiting a bit about the table, but obviously the hostess felt bad and offered to comp our first round of drinks. That was nice of her - we thought!  We all thoroughly enjoyed our meals and had plans of bringing out of town visitors back as soon as got the opportunity. The problem came when the bill arrived and they forgot to comp our drinks. We decided to say something to the bartender who passed it off to the very rude manager on duty.   The manager proceeded to make us feel as though we made up the fact that the hostess offered to comp our drinks explaining that \"she shouldn't have offered that and we usually don't do that\". We then told him that really wasn't our problem, but his hostess offered it and we expected it to be honored. He then rudely walked off trying to locate the nowhere to be seen hostess, even trying to call her. He came back to the POS station located right by our bar seats and said \"this is BS\" while hastily punching into the POS system. All the while making us feel very awkward. He did not handle that situation correctly at all and sadly left a bad taste in all of our mouths that not even that delicious tasting meal could salvage.",

Most recently, I called ahead to make a reservation at Richardson's to give this group of restaurants another shot. When we arrived, the hostess said the person who made our reservations \"messed up\" and was supposed to call me back to notify me they were moving our reservation to Rokerij rather than Richardson's due to a table mix up. We were never called. She assured us the menu was almost identical, so I didn't make a big deal about it. We got the calamari, which was all right. It came with a sweet chili sauce that tasted like sweet and sour sauce you get with spring rolls at a Chinese restaurant. I ordered one of the specials: trout with cilantro-lemon pesto. It came with a house salad, mashed potatoes, and I got asparagus as the veggie. The salad tasted fine, but definitely did not seem like great quality. The server said the salad came with some sort of jalapeno creamy dressing, but it tasted like bottled Ranch dressing. It reminded me of a salad bar salad. The trout was also nothing special. The cilantro-lemon pesto was not lemony at all. The mashed potatoes were very good. That and the wine are the only reasons I'm giving them 2 stars. The New Mexican enchiladas with green sauce was VERY spicy. The server did not forewarn us. The server also forgot to bring 1 salad and never brought me silverware. For the price we paid, I expected more attention to detail and better quality food.",

    "text": "I saw this place on Check Please Arizona and thought it looked amazing so I decided to give it a try.   Right off the bat I was turned off by the forced valet parking. I asked if I could park it myself and was told no. I was about to leave but still came all this way to try it out so I let them park my vehicle. It's not that I'm a cheapskate, I just don't like people driving my car, it's lowered and has expensive rims on it and valet has damaged my things before.  Ok so, the car was parked and we went to the downstairs bar. I really love the look of this place, the bar was dark and really cool. I asked if they had a happy hour menu and the bar tender said \"not really\" and handed us a menu for food then told us the beer was $2 off, well drinks $6 and some wines were on special. I asked for my usual vodka martini and it was a generous pour but was a bit pricey at $9 even though I was told it was \"6 and a half, or 7 and a half\". Not sure why it's a mystery as to the pricing of drinks, it's a bar after all.  The menu for happy hour food was quite extensive but the prices were a bit steep. I decided to try the chipotle ribs for $9 and my woman went with the brie toast for $10.  The ribs were small and kind of tasteless really. They had a bit of spice and the meat was tender but they lacked flavor. The rice was wet and nothing to write home about and the little tortilla did nothing for me. Overall a very bland dish and pricey for the 5 little ribs that came. I compare this to something like the ribs and fries dish at White Chocolate Grill for $10 which has a half rack of delicious ribs and a generous portion of amazing fries. I go back to WCG for that. I would not go back here for this.  The toast with brie was sad. Tiny pieces of bread with a smear of brie for $10? Nothing to dip into? Garbage. You should be ashamed to serve that dish for the price you charge.  Also, downstairs had no wifi and there is no way to get any signal from a phone.   The bartender was ok but he left his duty to spend 15 minutes writing specials on the chalk board and left his patrons sitting there with empty drinks and empty plates. We might have ordered another drink but didn't have the opportunity to so we just left.  What a shame. I like the idea and look of the place but they fail on the food I tried and to have valet only screams pretentious LA wannabe restaurant.",

The food and service are always amazing. Some of my favorites are the adovada, the Danish pancake, and the French toast for breakfast. For lunch the BBQ chicken pizza is always on point. The dinners are fabulous for the carnivores, the steaks and chops are simply divine.   I recently went for a big group of 15+ ladies and we reserved the back room. It was so much fun to have the spot all to ourselves and when the door as shut you couldn't hear our boisterous voices booming through the rest of the restaurant.

For my appetizer, I ordered fresh raw oysters and they tasted wrong. Smelly not fresh for baby oysters.  I mentioned this situation to the waiter and took the oysters and returned them to the kitchen and came back to our table and said he could do nothing about the inedible raw oysters. There had been no other complaints. Period. He did not remove the cost from our check. We never went back. That night we spent hundreds of dollars and had such poor customer service that none of us will return.",

The food was fantastic and the wine was delicious (of course). The service has declined a bit over the past couple years.  At times the servers and/or bartenders are too rushed and can be slightly rude at times. If not for that Rokerji would definitely get 5stars from me.",

Saw this place on yelp pretty good review so decided to check this place out. Everything here is so dim which I don't mind as it's a cute date night set up. We were sat down quite quickly. However after the waiter sat us down he didn't come back until after 15 mins to ask for drinks. Bf and I asked for water. Water took another 15 minutes. Place was pretty empty. We saw him chit chatting. After food came out. Everything looked so yummy so decided to forget about long wait. Had the ceasar salad which was yummy. Next was the entree. SALTY! Side dish. SALTY. Bfs entree SALTY. Bfs side dish okay. I decided to be full after taking a bite of nothing but saltiness. Definitely will not be coming back. As I'm writing this I still taste the salt in my mouth. Lol it's been weeks.",

    "text": "One of the best steakhouses in the Southwest! I brought my wife here for what we call \"a fancy dinner date\". We saw Rokerij featured on PBS' \"Check Please, AZ\" and it seemed like the perfect place for a romantic dinner - we were not disappointed.  Rokerij is a Dutch smokehouse with a New Mexican menu - they are most famous for their carne adovada and their steaks (the tomahawk steak is insane).  The building itself is beautiful rustic cottage, and the interior is equally appealing with a very intimate and classy feel. There is also a downstairs \"cellar\" with a second bar and additional dining; that space is limited and fills up too quick but it's worth it if you can get a booth down there. The atmosphere is genuine, this restaurant is legit. Also a nice touch, are the unique metal plates the food is served on - gives an old European feel to the meal.  Aside from a hostess who acted like we just woke her from a slumber and actually asked us \"how may I help you?\"... ummm we are here to dine? That elicited a look of confusion, not sure why lol. Aside from that annoying hiccup, our server was fantastic - she was attentive and fast and gave honest recommendations to make sure we ordered something that would be to our satisfaction.  We started with the carne adovada sliders, which were incredibly moist, tender, and flavourful. We gobbled them up pretty quick and they were rather filling.  My wife ordered the Rokerij Steak, which is a surf n turf - filet mignon and crab, and I ordered the prime rib. Both our dishes were amongst the best we've ever had, I'll just leave it at that. My wife complimented the quality of the meat and adored the sauced. My prime rib was gigantic and cooked to perfection - there was nice crispy sear on the outside, with seasonings, and nice & pink on the inside. As far as prime ribs go, it was a masterpiece!   Needless to say, we dropped around $!60 for a dinner for two, but this is a once-a-year type dinner for us and I look forward to being able to go back one day. As far as smokehouses go, and especially dutch-style smokehouses, Rokerij is one of the finest restaurants around.",

    "text": "Let me start off by saying that I love Richardson's and have been eating there for 25 years. That being said their sister restaurant Rokerij was an absolute train wreck! So much so it's almost hard to believe what you are about to read. Lets start off with the reservation, it took some kid 15 minutes to take my name and make a reservation. So bad it was someone had to finally take the phone from him to finish a 17 minute reservation. On to the next day. Many restaurants will call the day before to confirm your reservation and it's almost always done during the day. Not them they called my house at 9:30 at night and woke everyone up. I said to the kid who called what the hell are you doing? His reply: my job! At this point I should have seen the writing on the wall and cancelled the reservation for the next day. But we didn't! So on to Saturday night dinner. First off the place is loud, real loud I'm good with it but it's not Romantic intimate dining like they post on their site. So the first thing I did was ask to speak to a manager to tell him what took place the prior 2 days. I found him to be very aloof and had his mind on 10 other things. On to dinner my wife and I order an ice tea and a glass of wine for her. The tea came in 5 min. The wine took 15 min. So slow we had a busboy bring it finally . We ordered an appetizer of bacon wrapped shrimp and we waited over 20 min. During this time we placed our dinner orders. In 30 seconds after we ordered dinner they bring me my salad. I said where's the appetizer please take the salad back. The waitress comes back to the table and says it should be coming right up. And then she brings us bacon wrapped jalapeno poppers! I said we didn't order these she looks confused? I said bacon wrapped shrimp her reply is not I'm very sorry it's you realize all your food is going to come out together. I said no! Slow the dinner down and please speed up the correct appetizer. So after 25 minutes we got the appetizer and it was good as always. The server then said this is on the house and I said thank you. Dinner: I had the chicken schnitzel with a baked potato. The schnitzel was dry and had no seasoning in it all all. The sauce was suppose to be a butter sauce with capers. It was running butter water with no flavor and onion and capers in the bottom you couldn't get to.The baked potato was not fully cooked and very firm. My wife had salmon sliders she said were well done but she doesn't like to complain. She ate 1 of 3 On to the check. The waitress is no where to be seen so the busboy brings the check On the check is a 19 dollar charge for the shrimp they were paying for Plus a 10 dollar charge for the Jalapeno poppers we didn't order And a 7 dollar charge for a house salad that was suppose to be included with the meal. Because the server wasn't around I vented to the busboy again and he got them taken off the bill Then the manager shows up and says how was you dinner. I said seriously? You don't know what went on? He said no. I said that explains why things were not done correctly on the bill. He was clueless. I eat out a lot and love writing good reviews. In fact this is only the second bad review I have ever written . When the reservation part is a disaster And the confirmation is a disaster and the service is a disaster and your dinner is no good all I can think is bad management?  And one last thing when I spoke to the manager for the second time after the dinner his excuse was a big table had sent back and several people changed there meal orders? I didn't realize that trickle down affect would be so severe lol Give me a break. I'm so upset because again we love Richardson's and think since the menus have a lot common dishes the food would be great Unfortunately nothing further from the truth",

    "text": "I just got back from Rokerij.  My husband and I went there for Happy Hour last night and sat at the bar downstairs and had a nice time. We checked it out because my girlfriends and I were having dinner there tonight and had made reservations for 3 people at 4:00 pm.  We get together every other month at a restaurant and spend quite a bit of time catching up.  However, we are always EXTREMELY generous with a tip to make up for the time we take at the table. Today, we arrived at Rokerji and were immediately seated downstairs....great!  We all had two glasses of wine and full dinners.  We had our money together (which included a 25% tip)and were enjoying our second glass of wine when the waiter asked if we could vacate the table (it was barely 6:30) as they had another reservation waiting.  I asked if we could go sit at one of the other two tables that had been sitting empty ever since we had arrived at 4:00 and they said no, they were reserved!!!  They said we could go upstairs and sit at the bar there, so we thought no big deal.  Then we went upstairs to a totally packed bar.  I eat out at restaurants OFTEN and have never basically been told give me your money and get the hell out; especially after only 21/2 hours!!!!  One of the waiters upstairs said that their reservations are only good for a 2 hour seating.  This did not appear on their website or open table; if it had, I would not have reserved.    The food was EXCELLENT, but I will never go there again.  We did not penalize our waiter for the rudeness of the owners, but I can assure you, we will share this experience for years to come.

For the next 15 minutes we tried to signal the lone waiter and the bus person without success. Went back to find hostess but nobody there. Took another couple of minutes to attract the attention of a bartender at the bar to tell him we were leaving. Then we left.  Rokerij advertises it is open till midnight. My impression is they had mentally closed at 10:30pm.",

It was plated on what I think were mashed sweet potatoes !!!  Now that being said the enchiladas plate we ordered was extremely burnt & covered over with sauce (though still tasty once you dug in ) it was a disappointment and should have never been served. Lastly the young lady that took care of us kindly removed enchiladas plate from our bill (which we appreciated ). Since she did an outstanding job & tried to make the experience better, we tipped her 20% plus the cost of the enchiladas plate ( it was Christmas & it wasn't her fault that is was bunt & covered in sauce right?)  I would've given them 5 stars... it was a minor mistake & I'm sure they are usually on point but still.  We'll try them again this weekend on our way driving back from NM to Palm Springs hopefully it's a fluke and not a trend.  #staytuned",

    "text": "Food 5 stars / Service 3 stars (Read Below)  Rokerij is part of the Richardson's/ Dicks Hideaway Family  - I've loved and been too both Richardsons and Dicks hideaway several times and always excited for my next visit.  Rokerij is located right off 16th street - reminder additional parking around back.  The restaurant appears to be an old brick home updated and converted super cute. Upon walking inside immediately in front of you is the bar to left and seating to right with huge fire place.  The restaurant decor reminds me of a dark cigar type with dark colors and low lighting.    Today brought me with for Happy Hour with a party of over 20 Ladies - celebrating Ladies empowerment and leadership. It was a brief Happy Hour - today I ordered one of my favorite Wines - La Crema Chardonnay it's not an expensive wine but oddly so refreshing and one of my favorites.    From the Menu - Ordered the Chipotle Ribs that were absolutely amazing - the meat literally feel off the bone the spices and seasoning was perfect.    Service - Now here comes the tricky part, today was a large group - so upon seating I asked the server if we were able to split checks individually she politely said sadly I'm only able to do checks by table.  Immediately I knew issues would arise, as no one carries cash anymore.  At my table we were able to figure out check in a timely manner using cards and cash - but saw other tables were struggling and the poor server was trying to stay as positive as she could.  While I'm not sure if this was a rule for that day - or a usual rule not to split checks.  But this manner usually does not benefit the server - immediately I felt bad for the server with a party over 20.  Now I didn't talk to the Manager - but someone mentioned they did, she was informed that they tried to accommodate us with extended Happy Hour pricing and tables. Myself nor my table was aware of extended Happy Hour pricing and thankful they had seating.  Because I love this place - this one time issue will not dictate my future visits. I think initial communication may have limited issues with Party and restaurant.",

I love the bar where we sat and waited for the rest of our friends to arrive. It was a very busy place because it doubles as the front of the kitchen where you can watch all the activity first hand. Quite entertaining actually.   The Rokerij steak was a bit pricy.... but my taste buds weren't disappointed. My wife had a shrimp and HOME MADE pasta dish that was also delicious. Gata love home made pasta!  The only bummer was my green chili mashed potato's appeared to have been made a few days earlier and not very palatable... same as the first visit. AND since this is Hatch Chili season I was hoping to get a little heat, but no joy.  Don't be scared... hit this place up and ENJOY. It's worth a visit for the atmosphere alone!",

    "text": "This was the fourth time I dined at The Rokerij in Phoenix,  the first two times I had a $100 gift card which neatly paid for two people, the third time the VP of my company treated and tonight a friend bought me a birthday dinner, so I have yet to pay to dine here.  Regardless of where you are in the world, The Rokerij is unique and a treat.  First off, there are VERY few restaurants west of the Mississippi that have basements.  The Rokerij's is a great place to mingle with friends.  Upstairs is a dark and friendly atmosphere that is thick with pecan smoke from the kitchen.  It is a small place with limited seating.  And the lines to snag those seats is long 7 days a week.  People who dine at The Rokerij tend to linger for hours so don't expect a rapid turnover.  And reservations are only accepted for parties of 4 or more.  I have seriously had THE best steaks I have ever had in my life at The Rokerij.  They broil them right in front of the bar patrons and honestly there is probably only a handful of places in America where steaks are done to such perfection.  Perfection is not cheap, and no guest should reasonably expect to get out the door for less than $50 per person, but more likely $75 or more.  Is it worth it?  Yes!  Tonight, being my birthday, I chose what I had a taste for and that was a Crab Louie salad.  I read some reviews and they agreed that the Crab Louie at The Rojerij is the best in Phoenix.  Several said it was much too large for one person.  So we pre-agreed that we would split the salad and order a couple of \"small plates\", which are equivalent to appetizers, but a bit more exotic.  When I heard how big the Crab Louie was I expected to get mounds of lettuce with the usual toppings in modest quantity.  The opposite was True.  The amount of lettuce was about what you would expect in a small dinner salad at Denny's, but it was HEAPED with real crab, many of the pieces being very chunky, and a generous amount of tomatoes, cucumbers, hard-boiled egg and avocados.  It was served with a Louie dressing and a Roquefort dressing.  I have had a taste for an awesome Crab Louie for about 6 months and being my birthday I felt I finally deserved it.  This one was amazing.  Bear in mind it was $20, which is extremely expensive for a salad, but split two ways it was just right.  To accompany the salad we ordered two appetizers.  One, a smoked sausage with caramelized onion was the perfect complement to the salad.  The other, bacon wrapped shrimp, was insanely good.  The bacon was crispy and tasty and the shrimp was tender and perfect.  I had heard that The Rokerij is known for their Bloody Mary's and we both had one.  No disappointment.  They were tall, full and spicy.  They were served with a beer chaser of Sam Adams (?!?!?) all for $7.  No argument there.  The amount of food between splitting the salad and appetizers was perfect.  We both ate everything and were pleasantly full.  That is until the waitress mentioned the dessert menu, which included Creme Brulee.  This was a \"must do\" so we split it.  What can I say?  Sinfull?  Covered with very fresh berries, the caramel topping was torched to a smoky perfection.  I could eat one of these for breakfast every day of my life.  Needless to say the atmosphere at The Rokerij is unique and as far from a \"chain restaurant\" as you can get.   I have always found the service head and shoulders above nearly any restaurant I have ever been to.  From the warm greeting at the door, to the waitress, to the very engaged busser to the (I'm guessing manager on duty) who came over to our table just after the bill was paid to very warmly thank us and shake both of our hands.  The Rojerij is THE place in Phoenix to enjoy the best of the best in food, one of the best dining environments in the country, and be made to feel as if you are close as family as to those in charge.  Don't be turned off by having to wait an hour or more and then ending up sitting at the bar.  If you really need to get your food faster, may I suggest McDonalds or Burger King?  In the end you get what you deserve to get if you know what to expect.",

Nothing rushed and I thought that they were just giving us our space. However we came back for Mother's Day and I realized this is just how they are. Really slow and aloof. We were there at 9am and it was empty, only a few tables. But that didn't move things along. We had a two year old with us and this is not a kid friendly place. No high chair nor booster. So imagine sitting there way too long trying to entertain a two year old on your lap! Go here when you want an intimate meal and you have nothing else you need to or want to do.",

Since then Richardson's was burned down and Roker now serves the menu items that I loved at Richardson's!   You visit, you need to get the regular salad to start which is so simple but so amazing. Next you need to get the Garlic platter which is an appetizer that I absolutely love (the cheeses, the peppers, the sauce, the roasted garlic and the toasted baguettes- AMAZING!) Whenever we are in town (we now live in California), I make it a point to go back and eat this platter at least once during the trip.   This place is Southern Mex food and there is not a restaurant that can compare. In fact the closest I have gotten to eating something as tasty is when we create our own replication of the platter which is good but not the original!   In addition, try the quesadillas, chicken dish, bacon wrapped scallops..... all so yummy!",

This place is sexy....from the moment you start the slow descent down the stone steps you start to feel sexy ( well i did ! )  Anticipation starts to lick at you,  and you get the feeling you are about to experience something memorable.    The lower level of Rokerij Does not disappoint.  Upon entering I began to feel wanton....  Dimly lit with only 3 circular booth style table's, nice copper topped bar & a sexy hearth flanked by chairs, wonderful framed artwork dripped from every wall, I knew I was in date night heaven.  The waiter came over immediately, and was attentive throughout Dinner . Solid wine list offering by the glass /2 glass pitcher or full bottle.(we had a New zealand red that was very good)  An eclectic menu to chose from ; I ordered the sausage plate which arrived piping hot  with four perfectly grilled spicy sausages layered atop pinto beans, and a tortilla.  This was  a more spicy meal than i  had anticipated, and such a generous portion,  that  i actually could not finish it and had to have it boxed up .( great box that they give you--it is like receiving a gift) My dinner companion had the skewers over rice and beans and he enjoyed it .  Every thing about the place was hot and sexy we did not feel rushed as lingering is allowed here .....we finished up the wine by the hearth .  Ambiance & great service = a fabulous night   Update;  Happy hour here rocks. I can never say enough great things about the Rokerij!!",

    "text": "I've adored the downstairs bar and fireplace here for years - and had always been happy with the food and service. Somehow, the place fell out of rotation and off my radar for years. Until last week - when I was invited to join a small group for reverse happy hour. $5 wine, draft, marg.  $5 small plates. And all well worth it!  Between the four of us, we ordered: 2 orders of prime rib sliders 1 order carne adovada sliders 2 order shrimp piri piri 2 orders smoked salmon 1 order grilled oysters 1 order rokerij oysters  And it was WAY too much! Lots of food went home with us.  The shrimp piri piri with toast points was amazing - will definitely be ordering it again. The carne adovada sliders were the highlight of the night. GREAT flavor! The prime rib sliders were okay - but as others have pointed out - quite skimpy. The salmon was tasty - but we would have been fine with one order instead of 2. Grilled oysters were OK. I got spoiled with grilled oysters in New Orleans - these didn't come close. Rokerij oysters were fantastic and will be ordered again, for sure.  Happily - there's lots on the menu we didn't get to. Which means a great excuse to go back. Soon, and most likely often.  For me, the best part is the 10pm to close happy hour - even on Sunday. Not too many people going out for food and drink at 10 on a Sunday - gives me a guarantee of a spot at the bar and stellar service.  WIN!",

    "text": "Went here with the Supper Club in November for a 6:30pm dinner. Our table ended up being downstairs, and we had to go through the kitchen. However, I was pleasantly surprised by the ambiance downstairs - candlelit lighting, cozy ambiance, and menu specials written on the chalkboard (felt very New York).  The waiter was prompt in arriving to take our drink orders and to offer suggestions. I opted for the Prosecco ($10) since they didn't offer Moscato.   We started off with the Roasted Garlic Plate ($16) based on the waiter's recommendation. I expected the garlic taste to be overpowering but it was quite subtle, especially when it was spread over a piece of bread and topped with the cheese sauce. I don't know where they get the garlic, but those things were humungous! (The garlic was almost the consistency of butter, the way it was roasted.)  For the entree, I opted for the Pasta Heidi ($15), which consisted of green chile linguine, chunky slices of grilled chicken, and a chipotle cream sauce, served over a grilled tortilla. The plate came out piping hot and smelled so good! The pasta tasted so fresh and although I can handle spicy foods, this dish had my mouth burning. I could only handle a few small bites before I got full; had plenty of leftovers for lunch and dinner the next day.  Two of the gals ordered the special of the night, something with bone marrow, an enchilada, a tamale, and a side of what looked like fettucine alfredo. The other gal ordered the Chimayo Chicken ($22), which is stuffed chicken breast with a side of asparagus. I took a bite of this and found it pretty spicy (stuffed with poblano chiles), but delicious!  We shared a chocolate dessert, which is decently sized and enough to share between five gals. I could only handle one bite as it was too rich and chocolatey.   Our waiter was very attentive, knows the menu, and provided very prompt service.",

The steaks are prime and aswsome, as is the duck with chile glaze.Other entrees feature great fish and shrimp and homemade made pasta.   Cesar salad is great, The garlic appetizer is awesome for two or three.  The wine list is good, not exceptional but you don't need to drink Screaming Eagle  at $1500 at this restaurant its an over kill.  Margaritas and mixed are also wonderful.   Brunch with the $6 Mimosas on the weekends are always a deal.    Bottom line this is a wonderful place with its sister restaurant next door, Richardsons.  Reservations as is Dick's Hideaway are definately suggested. I would put these places in the top 6 in the Phoenix area.",

It's a bit hard to find, and be prepared for the parking situation to be hairy. I would just keep a few bucks of cash on me so that you can just make use of the complimentary valet.  It's a neat setup- I think its' 3 different restaurants in one building. Our reservation was for quite a bit later, but we were able to wait in the outside bar area, where we hung out and had some drinks before being seated. They did graciously try to work us in early- something we very much appreciated, given that it was Saturday and we had a big group.  The food was really great. The whole diet thing kind of gets in the way of True blue Mexican food (Rokerij specializes in New Mexico Tex-Mex) but I wound up getting their peppercorn steak. Incredible. It's a super tender cut of sirloin balanced on a slab of french bread, and the whole plate is drenched in this savory, creamy, not too peppery sauce. OMG incredible. My husband got another steak as well, and it was also really good. I asked for rare and got mine pretty bloody, so that was great. Didn't get to taste anybody else's items about the table, but everybody seemed pretty satisfied.  One last tip- the online menu is not super accurate. They have a pretty great specials menu scribbled on a chalkboard- there were very many things on there that I was tempted by that did not show on their online menu. So keep an open mind when you go.",

I had been excited to try happy hour here, but I was a little less than impressed. The happy hour specials are only available at the bar, which was somewhat crowded and put you in close quarters with other people. The happy hour drinks are somewhat limited to beer/wine/ margarita. I had the margarita and it was not fantastic... very standard margarita fare. The happy hour pricing on the food is a dollar or two off normal price, but the portions are large. I had the adovado sliders and the husband had the sloppy joe.... I thought they both were lacking something, maybe a fresh element? They were very filling and tasted alright, but I wouldn't go back for either dish. Other items may be better (and I've had some really good items at Richardson's and Dick's in the past...) so I would go again, but it isn't at the top of my list.",

    "text": "As a long-time fan of Richardson's restaurants I regret rating Rokerij with two stars!  We have been dining here for about 12 years and have now consistently been disappointed. 3 times in the last 6 months; took forever to get a round of drinks,  substantially small and wilted salads, food either cold or over cooked, quality of steak is not the same, AND service is slow, slow, slow.  It appears that restaurant has slowed down with more competition in central Phoenix hence servers are limited and it leaves me wondering how fresh the food is....price, quality and value is incongruent.",

I've had the Rokerij steak twice, it's perfect.  The dungeness crab is plentiful and melts in your mouth alongside the delicious fillet.  I'm more of a meat and potatoes kind of guy and I even crave the vegetables here, they are so fresh and tasty.  I've also had the sea bass on one occasion and that was equally wonderful.  The only thing that could maybe have been better was if our server (on one occasion) was a little more knowledgeable about the wine list.  It's big, I'll give her that, but she wasn't familiar with many of the bottles on the reserve list.  We received great service though, so I can't fault them there.    This is my go to for a great meal or special occasion.  Reserving a table through opentable/yelp app was extremely easy and accurate, walked and was seated right away.",

    "text": "We went to Rokerij for my sister's big graduation dinner.  We have been here before and loved the food, so it was an easy decision to go back for this special event! This time, we rented out the private dining room for our group of 14 people.  The room minimum is $500, which is prepaid, but applied to your bill at the end of the night.   The room is located toward the back of the restaurant, closed off from the rest of the tables, but you still get the energy from the music playing.  The room has a TV and audio set up, so you could bring your own music if you really wanted to.   We used the TV for a slideshow presentation of my sister.  The staff was very helpful and figured out how to set everything up, so it went PERFECTLY!  During the dinner, the slideshow was left on the first photo, so it was a background image of my sister's graduation, which added a nice touch. The waitress made sure everything was incredible.  She offered several suggestions for us and was always there to fill up our glasses with drinks and water. We got the Toasts, Artichoke Dip, and Bacon Wrapped Shrimp appetizers - all of which was delicious! Everyone at the table got different entrees, which were all eaten up!  The Chimayo Chicken was a hit at out table, as were the seafood options (salmon, mahi mahi, ahi) .  We had put in a special request that my sister's boyfriend was going to propose that night, so our waitress ensured that everything was PERFECT.  She had the champagne and our cake ready to go when he popped the question.We all agreed that it could not have been a better experience!    Thank you all for making this an unforgettable evening!",

Dimly lit, with an ultra-sexy atmosphere, the food is equally as impressive. My go to dish is the Rokerij Burger. Juicy, well-seasoned, and leaves you satisfied.  My only gripe is that it's always packed during the evening, and hard to get a table without a reservation.   5 stars :)",

The handling of the swordfish and halibut and scallops was Excellent!  Cooked to perfection, paired with great Fresh sauces or salsas and such a great choice of veggie side dishes - beets!  broccolini!  other interesting stuff!!  You get what you pay for.  Absolutely.

I had a dish that was \"smoked\" and  the smoke flavor really overpowered the dish.

The entrees arrived before the appetizer and the before meal bread came as we were finishing dinner. My chicken enchiladas had no discernible chicken and was just a large mush pile. None of us five liked our meals.  The only good thing was the roasted beet side dish.  Maybe this qualified for one star. This used to be our favorite restaurant in the area.  No longer.

    "text": "I know that you want to hold onto the Richardson's brand, but when you have Rokerij and Richardson's name in one place, I just wondered \"why.\" It is confusing. just sayin.   Walked into the new patio space between the 2 structures and was really excited by all the space. It was a Tuesday 6:30 reservation, so the crowd was light. We were greeted with a smile and confirmed our reservation for 5. The hostess kindly pointed to the dining room and we ended up being corraled into the original dining room. We were in the way of the wine coolers and the restroom and the stairs... and we got the looks from the servers trying to move about. But where did they want us to go? Should have we been offered a spot to wait on the patio? Please work that out.   Food: Once sat down, Ashley was our server and was quick to point our the specials. We sat for a little bit before the drinks came. We ordered some apps. Really slow service, but tasty apps. The #3 pizza was awesome. Cannot beat that sausage! We also got the blackened scallops. Excellent!   For dinner, I had the Pork Chop Chorizo with the Green Chili Potato (GCP). Say no more! Excellent! There was a tenderloin ordered with GCP and the vegetables. Really good. Everyone loved their food! But Ashley was having a tough night. Wanted a second bottle of wine and they had to find one - took a little while. Once we got our second bottle of wine, we did not see anyone til we were done.   My wife just reminded me of something really weird that happened. They had mixed up the sides on 2 dishes. So Ashley took both plates back to the kitchen and switched the sides on the plates and brought them back... Every restaurant I have ever been to, would have just brought a correct side to the person. It was really tacky.  Certain things are just outstanding, but some items are just done better in NM. The ambiance is great. Now if I can just get some proper service...  Quick Tip - If you don't mind sitting at the bar, go downstairs. Great service, and they have a reverse happy hour that has 1/2 price apps!",

    "text": "This oddly named restaurant will not disappoint.  The owner understands that a unique menu with daily specialties brings people back again and again.  We have been coming to this restaurant,  it's sister restaurant (Richardson's), and the hidden gem (Dick's Hideaway) for over 20 years.  Each of these restaurants offers a different vibe and menu but all three should be added to your must-visit list.  The Garlic Plate is the best appetizer on the menu and a terrific way to begin your dining adventure with its slow roasted elephant garlic, peppers, various cheeses, and sauces over a crispy tortilla in a piping hot pan served with perfectly toasted bread. If you are looking for something light, all of the nightly fish specials are a sure bet.  However, if you are craving a beefy steak experience, the bone in prime rib steak is what every meat lover hungers for.  This cut of meat is something out of The Flintstones kitchen.  Don't forget to try the house made horseradish sauce along with the au jus. No room for a dessert but they have really interesting wines at a special price for those who can skip away from the drudgery of work for a feast that will satisfy your palate.",

They have recently modified the specifics of happy hour for the better, currently it is $5 small plates, house wines and well drinks from 4-6 PM and 11- Close every night.  All of the small plates are top notch food.  I personally recommend the soft tacos with Adovada, Brie and Tenderloin Toasts, or Bacon Wrapped Scallops.  However, there are about 12 other options and all of the ones I have tried have been excellent. Steven is the regular bartender and is extremely courteous.  The music is also a highlight, it is played off an old mac laptop, and features a mix of classics and cutting edge indie rock.  I love the downtstairs bar, great atmosphere for what little winter Phoenix has to offer.",

This is exactly what a great cozy martini/wine bar should feel like - the dented copper bar, the iPod music, the big TV with sports that is somewhat incongruous but at the same time fits so well. The fireplace.  The service rocks, most of the time. I think I've had a few sullen servers at times - and some that aren't so knowledgeable about the menu - but for the most part, the bartenders rock.  The apps are why you should come here, especially during happy hour. Almost every one of them is phenomenal. The crab on the tostadas is my favorite, followed by the tenderloin toasts. The scallops are great, also.  The bad: The actual meals. I shouldn't say *bad*, but I've always been less than impressed by my meals here. I had a fish with mango salsa dish once that was borderline terrible. The Osso Buco is meh, and the steaks are good but not great.  The prices. Bring your best plastic cuz yer gonna drop at least a bill for two people - probably more like two bills. Martinis and glasses of wine run 12-14, and meals are 25-30ish. All the prices really seem amped up a notch compared to the actual quality of the food/drink you're getting; I suppose you pay for the atmosphere.  Conclusion - come here for happy hour drinks and appetizers. Skip coming here for a meal, and head down the street to the Barrio. If you're gonna spend a fortune, might as well enjoy it.",

Luckily there were 2 bar seats that became available, so we took them. We ordered the 3 cheese flatbread appetizer and it was delicious. I had a large salad for dinner which was perfect, as I was not very hungry. My husband had the chicken enchiladas that I tasted and were very good. The food is cooked to order so it did take a while to get our meal, but it was worth the wait and service was excellent. While waiting, we chatted with several people at the bar, and one couple offered us a taste of their appetizer. We returned the favor, when flatbread came. One more thing, do not leave without getting the decadent truffle dessert. Heavenly, but not over done in any way. All in all a great experience. I do recommend reservations.",

I've been there twice in last 2 months with large groups and both times the apps have been disappointing as have the entrees. I think management just isn't paying attention. However, Mondays are half price wine night and with enough wine everybody is happy.  We just won't be coming back.",

    "text": "Worst experience ever!  I am a fan of Richardson's so I thought we should check this place out.  Stopped in on a Friday night around 8pm without reservations just to see how long the wait would be.  Great host at the door greeted us and was really friendly.  He said there was over an hour wait upstairs but we could try our chances downstairs where it was all open seating.  We headed downstairs, grabbed a couple glasses of wine and waited for seats to open up.  We waited quite a long time for a table and multiple groups were able to grab seats before us, so we saw a couple ladies paying their  tab and asked if we could get their seats when they were ready to leave.  We ended up talking to them for a while before they left.  When we went to sit down, a very unfriendly brunette bartender said this other couple had been waiting longer and were next on \"the list\".  The other couple was already sitting!  She gave them our seats  at the bar and someone else who had just walked in grabbed their chairs.  I'll never be back.  If there's a list, tell the door guy and offer people to put their names on it when they arrive.  And if that couple needed to sit at the bar so bad, I would have been fine with the table.  Customer service is obviously lost on this place (except the sweet door host.  Worst experience I've had in a long time.  Contrary to my efforts to calmly explain to the bartender, she did nothing to resolve the issue.",

    "text": "Ambiance - great. But WORST. SERVER. EVER.  First time to go to the Rokerij on the recommendation of a friend. Three of us went on a early Sunday afternoon to the downstairs bar/restaurant and were seated in a booth. I had a question about the NM sausage on the brunch menu and the waitress says \"I don't know, I've only worked here five days\". Period. She doesn't offer to get a sample for me to taste, or even go ask someone who knows about it. Just \"I don't know, so live with it\".  Then, she refilled my friend's iced tea with water, and was annoyed when was corrected (and had to bring a new glass). She didn't even bring a \"new\" glass, just the same one she dumped out in the sinkthen refilled. Yuck. I question if that's even legal/sanitary. Finally, we paid $50 cash towards a bill that was just over $40 and she never came back with change. As we continually attempted to flag her down or make eye contact, we could tell she was just waiting for us to leave so she could give herself a big tip. When finally confronted (WE had to go to HER), she said, \"Oh, I wasn't sure what the extra $10 was for (so I kept it).\" Umm, the bill was for $40.44, not $40! That's what the extra $10 was for! I guess she expects the register will never close with the correct amount, or when in the same situation she just stiffs the restaurant for that extra amount? We definitely won't be going here again - there are plenty of other places nearby with same quality of food AND great service.",

    "text": "I have to say I am so sad to write this review.... Rokerji has always been hands down my favorite restaurant in Phoenix.  But last night I went out with 2 girlfriends we had worked hard to get a rare girls night out and we were treated very badly.  I had tried to make a reservation but there are no reservations for 3.  So we were willing to put our name in and wait.  Which is what we did and were told it would be an hour.  We did not complain and dug in at the bar and had a lovely time.  We were told 10 minuetes into our wait by David the host that we were really better off staying at the bar at that point we believe that our name was taken off the wait list and we were never going to get a table.  An hour and a half from when we arrived our name was not on the list.... We made it clear we wanted a table.  It is really unfortunate that we were ignored and I am very sorry that Rokerji has lost 3 clients.  We might not go every week but we saved up to go there and should have been rewarded not ignored.",

They told us we could sit at a table for regular prices which we said was fine then told us we could only stay for about an hour.  We decided that it was too much work to try and eat at this place.  We ended up somewhere else and had a much better experience with friendly staff and even a free desert.  Will not be going back to Rokerji.",

    "text": "The Rokerij is/was my favorite restaurant in town.  That is until recently...  a couple weeks ago I made a reservation mid week for one of the tables downstairs.  When I got there I was told it wasn't available.  The hostess wasn't rude but wasn't about to accomodate.  I reluctantly agreed to sit at a teable up stairs.  I ordered the usual, beef toasts, The Rokerij Steak - All winners in the past and the food I most brag about with friends and family.  Unfortunately the beef toasts were over cooked and the cheese wasn't melted.  Very disappointing as expectations are always high when eating here.  The food has always been great.  Worth the long wait to be seated.  But the steak, the item that frankly I compare all other steaks to, was another disappointment.  It came out at least a couple ounces smaller than normal and frankly just wasn't that good.  I'm willing to pay for a great steak.  Not sure what happened here but this meal fell way short of \"great\" status and was not worth the money spent.  Guys, I love this place and often take friends, colleagues from out of state to dine here.  But something is slipping.  Please get this under control.  I don't want to look for another favorite restaurant.  (but I will )",
