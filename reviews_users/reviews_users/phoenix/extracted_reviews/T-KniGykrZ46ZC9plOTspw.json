Very rich and creamy. I loved the mexican rice and refried beans in it! Cheese and sour cream? Uh yes!!! I would call this my perfect burrito. The asada meat had great flavor but a lot of fat to it? Too much fat in the burrito ruins the experience.. But still an awesome burrito, i think ill get the pulled pork next time knowing the asada has so much fat on it.",

We were the only people seated in the restaurant and it was clear the take out customers who arrived after our order was placed took priority.  I regretted adding gratuity on prior to receiving our order.   After what seemed like a long wait for a two burritos, I bit into my shrimp burrito only to taste the cabbage and hot sauce.  The shrimp were fairly well distributed further down but the guacamole was isolated to one bite somewhere around the middle. The tortilla itself was one of the best I've had but who was constructing the burritos last night?? My horchata was just meh.  Mostly ice and the guy had to be reminded to bring it all. I like the location close to our home and the fact that it is a small family restaurant.  It is clean with nice decor and a good menu but with so many other options in the area, after last night, I doubt I'll be back.",

I can't believe I haven't heard about this place beforehand. Definitely a must if you're in the area. Also, the steak burrito and veggie burrito were a hit amongst my group. The tortilla is freshly made and the size of the burrito should be enough to please even the hungriest of guest.",

However, their tortilla is very soft and chew which I like and yeah their sauces is pretty good too. I won't pay almost 8 dollars for beans and meat, just not my way of a burrito is.

His favorite is the carne asada burrito, mine varies between the shrimp, veggie, and shredded beef burrito! And omg... not going to lie I dream about these tortillas. Good ones are hard to find!! There are tons of hot sauce options on all the tables which I love! And to top it off the staff is always friendly, welcoming and attentive to their customers! We'll be back, always!",

I ordered the pork carnitas burrito and my mom ordered the pork green chile. I have to admit that my burrito had some over cooked chunks of pork which made it a bit dry. Not a deal breaker for me. I just had to throw some salsa on it. I took a couple of bites of my mom's pork green chile and I really liked that. The green chile wasn't overpowering and gave it just the right amount of flavor. The beans and rice they add to the burritos was good.  I would definitely go back but probably wouldn't order the carnitas again. I would love to try the shrimp burrito.",

Green chile and carne asada were pretty damn good too but there's something about the red chile mixed with the gooey cheese, rice, beans, meat, sour cream that hits the spot.  It essentially feels like mexican (or whatever...mexican-american..) comfort food.  Prices are good (comparable to chipotle/qdoba's of the world) but the flavors are not the same at all (burrito house is better...).  They do a good job mixing the burritos here too. No one bite of only plain white rice, one bite just beans, etc. Only complaint is it needs to be even spicier!",

Got a Carne Asada burrito with pinto beans(NOT RE-FRIED, also have black beans), the softest rices Ive ever had, monterey jack(HAVE TO ASK FOR JUST JACK if you dont want the mix), and onions/cilantro.   It was absolutely AMAZING, didnt even need to use either of the salsas. That doesnt mean I didnt though. im a huge green salsa fan so I was floored by the tomatillo sauce. Fresh, flavorful, good kick, but not overwhelming. This place was like being back in ventura california  a couple blocks from the ocean at taquiera vallarta, best mexican food I ever had... They also have bottled pepsi and coke, huge selling point for me, albeit the smaller ones at 2.50 a piece.   The only negative I could see is its on the upper echelon of cheap. It was only 10 bucks with a bottle of pepsi(cheaper with fountain drink), just not fast food cheap is all. But for the price, its worth EVERY PENNY. This isnt like some of these other burrito shop where they charge you 6.50 for a burrito with all that inside but its like the smallest thing ever. I always feel like I fucking asked to add those cause I wanted a big burrito damnit! NOT WITH THIS PLACE. I was full with like a 1/5th left and Im a big guy, like 280 big. I dont worry about my girlish figure in other words. This was more than enough for most people unless you just got done doing something extremely active(ie run a marathon).  I have no doubt everything else on the menu is good. Carne Asada is the gold standard at mexican places for me. If you can cook that, you can cook any other meat well. I was told the chile verde(pork) is even better. I bet seafood(shrimp) is as good, just not a seafood fan. They arent fucking around people, go there tomorrow, you will never be lead astray by a fat guy with 2 hands on his belly. Its the international sign language for someone with a stomach full of amazing food...",

    "text": "If there's one thing I can conclude from eating at the Mexican places that are most highly rated on Yelp, it's that white people have very bad taste for Mexican food. With the endless Mexican food options in Phoenix, it is this place and Santos Lucha Libre that are listed in Phoenix's top 5 restaurants. The latter was terrible, but PHX Burrito House seemed promising. Would this be the most disappointing week yet in my still-young Mexican food tour?   Unfortunately, yes.  PHX Burrito House is situated in the former digs of the also-overrated Fry Bread House. I will admit, the idea of burritos in an old converted house is pretty cool (maybe that's why this place has such rave reviews?). I looked at the menu, and it was sparse. Great! A place like this should have a sparse menu.  The list of ingredients in the burrito, however, concerned me a little bit. Rice, choice of pinto or black beans, meat, sour cream. Guacamole extra. What? Rice? Really?  I trudged ahead anyways. Got the carne asada burrito with guac. With a bottle of Fanta (no Jarritos?).  Almost $11.  Everything was just OK. The chips were OK. The burrito was just OK. Sorry, but it's hard to get excited about a burrito where 50% of the mass is rice and 40% is beans. I think there was a piece of actual carne asada in every third bite. Guac was relegated to a little vein near the outside of the burrito. Sour cream was only noticeable when I got to the bottom, where all the liquids inevitably end up.  It's pretty disappointing when I leave a place with the feeling that I could have gotten a better burrito at Filiberto's.  I've probably said this before, but if you want a sure-fire way to ruin a burrito, put a crap ton of rice in it. It's just filler. Would I eat here if I live in there area? Maybe.. But probably not, there's a Filiberto's across the street, and if I want a bad burrito, I might as well only spend four bucks on it.",

All of the ingredients were fresh from the bacon, beans, guacamole, even the chips! Not only that, but the staff was so welcoming and hospitable. The woman who took our order was so sweet. She went around to every customer in the restaurant to make sure they were satisfied, and it is not the type of restaurant where you have a server. You just order your food and grab it when it's ready. I definitely recommend this place and I most certainly will be back to try more than the breakfast burritos because I have no doubt about how amazing they are!",

The ratio of everything was totally off, and the ingredients were over cooked (chewy eggs and really mushy potatoes). However, the people that worked there were so nice at the time, that I decided to go back and give them a 2nd chance. This last time I ordered the Shrimp Burrito. It was pricey and terrible! The tortilla and most of the ingredients besides the shrimp were cold. They had that cheap pre-grated Mexican cheese that you can buy in bulk, and it was totally cold and weird. All of the contents were drowning in some kind of mayonnaise mystery sauce. It was all wrong. I wish I could like this place more, but they gotta step up their game!",

It's been quite sometime since I've been completely blown away with really great food. But I guess that's what makes it all the more special. Let me start by saying that they have the most amount of parking space compared to any other taco place that I've been to so far. It sets a positive tone right from the beginning.   I asked for their most popular menu item and the cashier handed me a small cup of their green chili pork to sample. Holy Moses! This has got to be THE most amazing tasting pork I've had thus far at a taco joint. It does have a fair amount of heat so may not be for those with very low tolerance. But for the fortunate ones, this is unbelievably flavorful. The pork is perfectly cooked and the green chili sauce is to die for! It was a fairly easy choice from then on. I got a green chili pork taco and a chorizo and potato taco. Both of these were exquisite.   My friend special ordered a chorizo quesadilla. This is generally not the best way to go since chorizo is overloaded with fat as is. The cheese makes it all the more greasy. The pork fat ended up oozing and forming a pool at the bottom..   Overall, this is one of the best taco places around town! It is easily my new favorite joint for my taco fix.",

It pretty easy to miss if you're going by your phone's GPS directions, but there is a giant sign out in front.   Anyway, when we arrived, it was pretty crowded. There were people waiting for to-go orders. There's also a little patio area where a few people were sitting.   I ordered a chicken burrito. It comes with everything I could want on a burrito... Rice, beans, sour cream, and cheese. That's what I always get when I order from a place like Chipotle. Also ordered margaritas which were a little pricey (I believe they were $7 each), but they were good.   It took a bit for us to get our food. The man stated it was because they ran out of tortillas (seems a bit odd to run out of tortillas at a burrito restaurant, but it's all good). My burrito was awesome. The meat was grilled perfectly. The sour cream and cheese really set it off. The tortilla was thin, but it had good flavor.   I'm glad we checked this spot out. It was a really good start to the day.",

Woah, that's pretty pricey for a bean and cheese burrito considering for $7 I could have gotten meat, rice, and sour cream in my burrito.   My order came out in about 5 minutes. Now, there are two types of bean and cheese burritos... those who throw some cheese dead center and you only enjoy it for 1/3 of the burrito, or those who have PROPER bean and cheese distribution... this was thankfully the latter. Overall, the flavor was great. They gave me a red and green salsa, neither of which were too impressive.

I'm really torn on this review, as PHX Burrito House has some huge strengths but also some significant weaknesses.  On the strengths side: the ingredients are fresh, the tortillas are delicious, the bungalow is minimalist-cute, and there is Negra Modelo. The excellence of the tortillas cannot be overstated -- the tortilla was, if anything, better than the fillings. The salsa verde was also really nice, with a mild kick to it, not just pure veggie-ness.  On the weaknesses side, those were the second most off-putting carnitas I've ever had. Half the lumps were burnt, and the other half were nothing but fat. It says something positive for the workmanship of the chef that I found this edible at all, but I wouldn't do carnitas here again. I ended up being just as relieved that the burrito runs heavily to rice, as it's quite pleasant rice. I can make better carnitas at home, but I wish my rice was anywhere near as good.  Service is incredibly sweet-natured but also very, very leisurely. Do not count on rushing in to pick up a burrito -- the people waiting for to-go orders had fallen into a sullen, slumped stupor, and the whole pace really works better if you're doing a contemplative ramble around the neighborhood, maybe with a book of modern poetry to keep you occupied as you wait.",

It's some sort of hybrid between A sit-down restaurant something more casual like a cafe, which made the process a bit confusing.

My wife thoroughly enjoys the carne asana burrito.   Bottled beer with a decent happy hour 2:30-5:30 at the time of this review. Beer selection is only ok. Not the best, but do have some craft options as well as some Mexican imports. They do have margaritas as well. Only food special during happy hour is nachos for $5, which I haven't tried.   Atmosphere is fine. Nothing super remarkable. Music isn't too loud, it's clean, and put together with, what I believe, are framed and blown up tarot cards on the wall, which are interesting to look at. They do have some outside seating which is super nice in the spring months.   Overall definitely worth a try.",

While I understand that the level of green chile quality that I am looking for will not be found in this neighboring state, I have been on the lookout for a burrito that can satiate my with-drawls since moving to Phoenix. This is not the place. The inside of the burrito was extremely dry and had very little flavor. I got a potato, egg and cheese to go. The tortilla was also less than perfect, as it was very chewy. At first, I thought the addition of the salsa was strange, but a nice addition. However, I have now come to understand that the salsa is completely necessary in order to eat the burrito as it adds the much needed moisture and flavor that the burrito by itself is missing.  I will say that the staff was extremely friendly and helpful. When the girl asked me if two salsas would be enough, I thought she was trying to be nice, \"who would actually need more than two?\", I naively thought to myself. You would ideally need about 6 to smother the burrito in to make it palatable. Maybe I ordered the wrong thing. I will say that the tacos look good. Possibly burritos just aren't this establishments strong suit.",

    "text": "DO NOT GET THE FISH TACOS!! WASTE OF MONEY.   So I went here a couple of days ago with my two boys. The burritos were very good. My one son had the shredded beef; which was flavorful but the meat had more fat then I like; not a good cut. The other son had mixed bean and cheese burrito which always hits home. You really can't mess up a bean and cheese burrito.   The burritos IMO were a bit pricey for burritos, they came with no side or complimentary chips. The place was hipster but when we went all the tables were filthy and had food and grease on them. We had to wipe our own table off to eat.   I got the tilapia fish tacos, because I wanted something lighter. The girl at the register said, \"Their awesome\" They were the worst fish tacos I have ever had. The only good thing about them was the corn tortilla. I poured salsa all over it just to choke it down. There was little to NO fish at all. Basically an un-flamed tortilla filed with cabbage. I ate them regardless.  It cost us about $30 for two burritos, two jarritos, and three fish tacos. Not a cheap eat. The hipsterness of this place is what you are paying for, really. I just wish the dinning area was cleaner.",

Otherwise they would have a solid 5 stars for sure. I look forward to the weather cooling off to sit outside but for now a beer and taco inside is pretty sweet.",

Inside, it's basically a house, with seats around in what would be the living room. I thought the price was pretty good and what you got was definitely worth looking. The only bad thing about this place is that the seating is limited.   So, I ordered the Al Pastor Burrito and also got some tacos in addition to my meal. The taste and flavor was there, but the service was a little slow. I thought the food came out a bit sluggish, but then again I can't blame them because it was during lunch hour. This place is definitely a place to check out if you're trying to find Mexican to eat. Another thing on why this place doesn't reach the top of my list is that there was a good amount of rice in the burrito which sort of turned me down. I found the interior and decor interesting and that the place is True to the name.",

I went in the cashier was friendly. I was the first person heading a very large line that came in after me. I ordered a no filler carne asada burrito with guac and a bacon egg and cheese burrito to go. I also ordered a Lagunita IPA while I waited for my order. I sat in the refreshingly cool dining area with my beer while I waited. I watched as others ordered and sat down as well. 15 mins went by and I start to notice people who were behind me already eating. Three police officers were seated after me received their order and finished eating and still no order for me. I was babysitting my beer and then finally finished it. I went up to the cashier and asked if they were still working on my order. He went to the counter and my order had been sitting there the whole time. I watched the man bag my order and make eye contact with me three times and not once was the order yelled out as ready. My name was clearly on the receipt. As for the burritos they were warm. The bacon egg and cheese burrito was good. No complaints there. The carne asada burrito had hard chunks of tough cartilage and needed salt. The total bill came out to $21. The inside was cool and the beer was cold. At least I can say I tried the place.",

FIRST off, the burrito is supposed to come with cheese and sour cream, but neither of my burritos contained either. The price is reasonable at 7 bucks, but it's best to get your food to go since the house lacks air cooling, but is big on flies. Red sauce gets the edge over green sauce. The disaster occurred today, only two days after a very good chicken burrito was consumed. Chicken was grilled and white meat and it held together nicely. The shredded beef on the other hand was wet and mushy and dripped through the tortilla and it was like a limp you know what and no cheese or sour cream in sight. This house could use some remodeling as well.",

Shrimps were good and I'm glad they threw in some additional hot sauces (and chips due to the wait) to help out the flavor on the burrito.   I'd say their issue is turning food. If they were full, you'd be waiting 20 minutes for a three minute \"Chipotle\" type burrito. Lady behind the counter was very nice. Worth the try if you're in the neighborhood.",

    "text": "I love Mexican food. I think this place actually has decent food but the tortillas seem under done and the insides can be a little soupy. What drove me to a low rating, is the poor customer service I experienced when stopping for a mid shift meal.  The teenage girls who are facilitating the restaurant are rude to some and pleasant to others. I've never been to Burrito House before, but I frequent restaurants around town and can say that there are a lot better options than this stop. Chipotle actually makes a better burrito. When the cashier took my order she took my credit card and swiped it, and then lifted up the floor mat for the other girl to sweep, card in hand. I know hands can be really dirty because of things we touch, but this was just blatantly gross. Almost to the point where I was willing to forfeit the credit card and just wait for the new one in the mail. I was charged $10 for a burrito that probably should have cost $7. I sat down at a table and waited for my burrito to come while I watched another young gentleman and his older companion come in. It's interesting how different two people can be treated. I sat there and waited while my burrito was being prepared, and they actually engaged in small talk. When my burrito finally came, the girl working the register handed it to me, or should I say tossed it to me. She turned around so fast she didn't even know she had done it. The other two patrons sat down and were served their food in a different fashion than how I was served. The other girl walked over to their table and offered them complementary iced tea because they were just going to throw out the batch at the end of the night. I think they were going to close within the next 30 minutes, so they wanted to get rid of the excess but not waste it. She filled two large to-go cups with iced tea and thanked them for coming in. I had to resume working that evening so I promptly finished my meal and was about to leave , but I thought to myself it would be nice to have a little caffeine jolt before resuming my shift. I walked up to the register and was not greeted again, but given a look which meant \"what can I get for you?\" I ordered an iced tea and paid for it. I don't expect to be given an iced tea for free, but I was hoping for a smile atleast. It's not always the food you ate at a restaurant, sometimes it's how it made you feel.",

It was about 6 pm when I got to the Burrito house,  after I ordered a slew of people came after. I had my dogs outside and asked the counter person if he could bring it outside to me so I could wait with my dogs on the patio.  Fast forward over 15 minutes and everyone that came if after me already had their order. I asked if my order was ready and they stated a few more minutes. The people that came after I inquired left with their orders.  The counter person finally came out with my order and I asked why everyone that came in after me had their order and I was still waiting outside with my dogs. He stated we had a dinner rush and it got crazy. I replied I ordered before the rush and I still got my order after the crowd.   The counter person stated he would talk with his manager. Then returned and stated the manager said you can either have your money back or the food. They did not even attempt to make the situation right. I asked for the money back and left furious. I will never go there again!",

Yes, there are a ton of great options for Mexican food in the Valley, and if you find yourself in the Melrose area looking for some hometown Mexican fare, then PHX Burrito House is the place for you.   On my last visit I went with their carne asada burrito -  savory chunks of nicely-marinated and seasoned beef with all the fixings wrapped in warm tortilla. I also added some chips and salsa. Great flavors that hit the spot. After settling for just so-so Mexican food as of late, I was happy that I came.  Staff (owner?) was beyond friendly. Wonderful service all in all.  Easy parking, freshly-made flour tortillas and salsas and GREAT hometown service make PHX Burrito House the place for me!",

The counter girl was exceptionally nice, offering me tiny samples of a few of the meat choices.  The green chile pork was HOT, while the beef in red chile and shredded beef were mild.  Ordered the two beef enchilada special.  Their red sauce is really good, not overly tomato-y or oily, with a nice spice level (I could taste the garlic).  The salt level for a forkful of enchilada and rice was perfect.  The cheese was really great (I loved how salty it was).  It actually tasted better as I continued to eat it.  The rice was plain, fluffy, and well-cooked.  I'll be back to check out their chorizo breakfast burrito.",

After she found out it was my first time eating their food, she offered complementary chips and salsa while we waited. We sat while people trailed in one after the other. Every person was greeted the same. \"Hi!, Hello!, How are you?, Good Morning!\" The energy was extremely vibrant.  Of course our food was amazing. The chips were thick and warm, not the cheap store-bought salty kind. The salsa wasn't too chunky or too watery for my pallet. I tried the chorizo and was not let down. Even baby in the belly liked!!! My fiance had the bacon eggs and potato burrito that was gone before I realized.   5 star all around.

I can't eat three tacos and sides on a menu and when I order just two tacos, the friendly customer service person always apologizes to me for what she has to charge me. The place is clean and accessible and I really think they have high quality food.",

I went on a Saturday afternoon and it wasn't busy at all, so I got to talk with one of the owners a bit.  I learned that they own El Sol and El Zocalo in Chandler.  I'd been to both of those places before and really liked them.    I got a carne asada burrito.  The meat was prepared properly and had a good flavor to it.  The owner gave me a sample of some of the chips and salsa, which were very good.  My favorite part about the burrito though was the tortilla.  It had a perfect texture and thickness to it.  The owner told me they make them all right there at the restaurant.    They had a good selection of breakfast burrito offerings too.  So....I came back the next morning.  I had the bacon breakfast burrito and I can honestly say it's the best I've ever had.  The flavor was tremendous, and again, I just can't get over how good their tortillas are.  Great place.  Extremely friendly owners.  Fantastic torillas. Check it out.",

I got the steak quesadillas and a sausage, egg, and cheese burrito. The steak was marinated with lime and was so delicious I could have eaten three more. As for the burrito, it's rare that a place can throw potatoes in and have them be light and fluffy, but these guys pulled it off.   Were it not so far from my house I'd be in more often, but maybe that's a good thing for my waist line. If you're in the area give it a try!   Ps, it's kind of tucked away in the back of a little cluster of buildings, which made it hard to find. And the Yelp pin drop may be off a bit.",

The shrimp burrito was what I  ate and I couldn't put it down, I inhaled the whole thing.   Mexican coke with real sugar in it was the icing on the cake.   We ordered take out over the phone and they got the order perfect.  I also want to note that although the burritos were very filling, they were not greasy at all, just perfectly cooked like a healthy meal you'd make at home for your family, but they wouldn't know that it's healthy by how amazing they tasted.   When I was craving burritos earlier in the day, I had never been to this place before, but they tasted exactly like my imaginary burrito tasted.   I'll definitely be back.

What Arizona is missing over places like San Diego, though, is a signature burrito. Over there, it's the California burrito. I have yet to find a good Cali burrito out here in Phoenix. However, PHX Burrito House has the next best thing. Their PHX Especial is absolutely delicious. The potatoes are high quality, great in texture, and not overbearing. The grilled onions and jalepenos are nice and crunchy. Spice is low, but they have some good salsa and hot sauce available. The eggs add great flavor without making it too breakfast-y. There's also some cheese, but not too much. The burrito itself is NOT a drippy mess; it actually feels like you are eating something somewhat healthy, as far as burritos go. Don't forget to add carne asada. I crave this thing at least once a week. This should be our Arizona burrito.  The building itself is small and very clean. The menu is short and simple. The staff that I've encountered is very friendly. There's a parking lot with enough spaces. It's divey in all the right ways for a fast Mexican food place while still being immaculately clean, friendly, not greasy, and extremely tasty.   I guess you could say I highly recommend it for their Arizona burrito alone. Enjoy!",

It is a very small dining area so get there just before or just after lunch to find a spot to sit. I had the Carna Asada burrito and a quasadilla. The food was made fresh and was very good. One of those spots that you have to order at the counter and get served after you sit. Customer service was good for the type of place it is. I would go back when in the area and feel like a burrito.",

It was good, but could have been better if 'every thing' included more than just rice, beans, carne, sour cream and a little salsa. It was a little bit plain for my tastes and the salsa wasn't hot enough, but the tortillas they use are great. The food didn't really live up to the hype of a 4.5 star burrito joint though and the price was slightly higher than a great hole-in-the-wall type Mexican place.",

The chorizo burro was huge. It tasted fresh and hot. Could have used a little heat but was very good. They added beans and potatoes and cheese.   The green chile burro was good but was lacking spice as well as was the salsa.  The horchatas were very good.   I asked for sour cream on the side which was forgotten about. Not a big deal but that, the lack of heat, and the lid dilemma keep this place from 5 stars.",

I searched yelp and this joint came up as being the closest to me with wonderful reviews. I stopped in to Phx Burrito House a hour or more before their closing time on a Monday. At the door I was told they had closed early because they weren't busy enough to stay open. I thought that was odd since they already close super early on Mondays I think 3 pm. Huh. Anyway I thought I would try again today, another Monday but this time it was 1ish so I thought I would take a chance. Well this time was the opposite, the parking lot was packed to the max with no parking. Now you see this place is on a busy street on a curve and you can't turn around in the parking lot so you have to back out into the busy road. Scary. All I'm saying is basically I've given them 2 shots, both failed miserably. There's plenty of other Mexican joints around with normal hours and decent parking.",

    "text": "Good burritos. Great value. Service = non existent. Ambiance = interesting. This would be the best way I can sum up this review. What started as our go to for breakfast burritos has gradually faded into a thing of the past (as of today). Not sure if something changed with management or what, but something has certainly changed in what seems like the last 6 months or so. It started with us observing others when we would visit get sub-par service (from unreasonably long wait times to incorrect orders). We personally hadn't experienced this so chalked it up to one-off situations. However, our last several visits have been interesting to say the least...  The food and value... If you're looking for a great spot to get a good burrito (with GREAT portions and price point), absolutely the BEST spot to go in central Phoenix. We've been coming here for quite some time and the burritos themselves NEVER disappoint. And the salsa is great as well! They offer a red and a green and both are superb (I'm not even a huge green salsa fan, but yes - try them both!). The guacamole is also amazing. Honestly, when it comes to the food itself, the value and the price, 5 stars all the way around.  The service (or lack there of)... About 50% of the time we'll call in an order to go and the other 50% we'll actually sit in the restaurant and eat there. The staff they seem to have onboard as of recently most definitely doesn't appear to have the same level of customer service that we used to receive here. When calling in orders, you're often placed on hold for SEVERAL minutes (I've actually hung up and called back most times because it takes so long), and when placing your order (whether in the restaurant or on the phone), staff seems to have their minds elsewhere (not on actually paying attention to what you're order). A - have them repeat your order back to you and pay REAL close attention to what they're repeating back because it's likely wrong (what pushed me over the edge today was the staff member actually arguing with me and telling me that I asked for \"no potatoes\"). Like, um... what? Definitely didn't so \"no\" anything. It took 4 different times of repeating back what I was ordering until he finally got it right. We've had very similar experiences when ordering in the restaurant as well - the staff at the register is often paying attention to ANYTHING else except the person standing right in front of them (what a concept that would be, hmmm).   The ambiance... Well, this is the most interesting part. We (used to) love going here because of the ambiance. It's an older house turned into a restaurant. It's quaint, cozy, and a great place to grab a bite to eat. Again, maybe what I'm about to say falls back on the staff we've noticed on hand as of late... and I'll start out by saying that I for one am very VERY rarely offended by pretty much anything. We've been in there a few times in the last month or two alone where the music choice - interesting is the most PC way I can describe it here. I'm not sure I can actually put the \"racy / raunchy\" lyrics playing on here without it being removed, but I'll let you use your imagination here. Again, I could personally care less, but if you're a family looking to walk in here with your kids I might caution you to what you'll hear. That's all.",

    "text": "I'm not entirely sure why it took us so long to finally try Phx Burrito House. I guess there's always that fear of disappointment based on all of the Yelp hype. But for the most part, I feel that PBH actually lives up to expectations in the areas that actually count.  It was our first time visiting and my girlfriend and I ended up ordering way too much food. One burrito with carne asada (added beans w/side of rice), which we decided to split in half. We also ordered three tacos, including grilled chicken, pork carnitas, and pork in green chile. And what the hell? As usual, I ordered a cheese quesadilla just to cover more ground.  Realistically, we probably would have been fine with just splitting the burrito and eating the chips, which were provided to us for free since it was our first time. The overall total was far less than what I was expecting, which is always a good sign.  I actually didn't expect much from the burrito, only to be pleasantly surprised. Yes, the ingredients are all decent, but what really surprised me was the quality of the tortilla, which packed a significant amount of floury flavor. I definitely intend to return to try out one of their breakfast variations (served all day). My girlfriend was equally as impressed.  The quesadilla also surprised us. The yellow cheese, which we feared would be harsh cheddar based on how it looks, was actually very light and buttery. It worked incredibly well with the high-quality tortilla, similar to what was found on the burrito.  As for the tacos? Honestly, they're fine - but I wouldn't really recommend getting them if it's your first time. Ingredients were all decent, but in comparison to some of my favorite places, I wouldn't really say they were memorable. For return visits, we'll most likely stick to the burritos and quesadillas.  For what this place is, I think they're a great option if you're in the mood for cheap-eating at a reasonable price. I look forward to returning and trying some of their other options.  Recommended!",

She was more than willing to help. They off many different bean options and they have the best quesadilla I've had in a long time. And the salsa! Not as spicy as I like but it is so damn good! The green has a little more kick which I love. I reccomend this place. Eat in or take it home.

There was nothing at my table that did not taste good. Let's say there was not too many conversations going on when our table was eating.   A friend of mine introduced me to this local Mexican restaurant. You pull in you see a house with lots of parking in the front. You walk in and you smell a home cooked meal. The spot is trendy. Even though the menu is written on a chalk board that sits on the wall it is colorful as well as creative. The menu is simple but has the most popular Mexican food options including chips and salsa. My carna asada and chicken taco was tasty. It was so good I ate too much. The chips were fresh that I dipped into a salsa that I have never had before. For dessert I had a tasty cookie that was shaped as a Piggy called a Cocito. It is like a ginger bread cookie.   Space is limited because it is a renovated house. Everyone is really nice that works there.",

    "text": "My wife and I stopped here for a quick lunch the other day.  The run down here is simple, you can choose between tacos or burritos, and a selection of meats, beans and cheese as your stuffing.  They offer classic but well done examples of burrito fillings.  Carne asada, chicken, green chile pork, red chile beef and a shrimp burrito as well, you can also opt for rice, beans, and sour cream, or just go all meat no filler, it's up to you.        My wife ordered a chicken burrito with a margarita to drink and I had the green chile burrito with a jamaica.  Starting with drinks, my wife loved the margarita, she said they didn't skimp on the tequila and that it tasted great.  As far as my jamaica, it was excellent, just the right amount of tartness smoothed out with a bit of sugar.  The burritos themselves were fantastic.  The green chille was well balanced, not spicy, but with a rich and bold flavor.  The beans and rice inside were much more then filler as well, they all tasted delicious on their own and I could easily make a meal out of them.  I did not taste my wife's burrito but from the smell, the chicken smelt well seasoned and looked moist and tender.  Considering my wife ate almost the entire thing, I'll conclude they know what they're doing.      In regards to service, the staff is great.  Our meal was out very quickly, and our server was attentive.  They even brought us out chips and salsa at one point, which I must say were on par with the rest of the meal in terms of flavor.(plus home made chips are always a huge bonus)      There's nothing I can really knock this place for.  Food was great, portions were huge and the staff was excellent.  Ill be back to try more as soon as I can!",

Like, for once, I've stumbled in a place that was both hip AND authentic AND tastes great. It's small and humble, with prices on par with Chipotle, so I expect something great.   I went with a green chili (pork) burrito with black beans. I can say that while the beans & rice are good, the main attraction falls flat. It's not spicy. It's barely flavorful! what a letdown. I found myself dousing it with the green habanero sauce featured at the table.   Oh yeah, don't expect any sort of complimentary salsa bar. Salsa (and chips) will cost you a bit extra, and if you're going to shell out the $3, you might as well just drop the same amount for a better burrito + chips + salsa combo at a place like La Santisima...or even Qdoba. This is me dropping stars because of superior, accessible places in the same area at the same price point.   At the end, I washed it all down with a freshly-made horchata...but halfway through, I was dealing with coarse granules of sugar! Gross!   I'm in no hurry to come back.",

Not only was this place dead but it had no good atmosphere at all. From the young man taking the orders to one of the owners present. One could at least add some low volume music so you avoid hearing the awkward silence. This is not to say they had bad customer service just no soul / passion in the restaurant   The chicken burrito was good but sadly the overpowering of refried beans made my burrito sloppy & unwrap-able. At the end it was a soggy mess. As for the chicken I was able to take out and actually taste it was juicy and flavorful. Tortilla was a tad bit thin but didn't bother me cause I'm not particular to thick or think flour tortillas.  For what you're purchasing this place gets a 4 out of 5 stars & for the ambiance of the restaurant I give them a 2 star rating. Overall it's a 3 out of 5. My recommendation, take your food to go",

The prep time, and the portions.  With all the Mexican food spots as well as national goliath Chipotle dotting the valley landscape, you'd better be doing everything right to thrive in this saturated burrito market.  From where I stand, this place will have an uphill battle.  A solid overall Yelp rating was what brought me here on my way home from work on a Thursday afternoon.  Its a cute spot right in the heart of the Melrose neighborhood.  I believe Fry Bread House used to be here once upon a time.  There's seating both inside and out, but only for probably about 25-30 at most. I got here around 4pm and the place was pretty dead so I figured I'd grab a few of their items super quick and be on my way.  Not so much.    I ordered their Shrimp Burrito (which includes chips and salsa on the side) and a plain quesadilla to go.  Total cost was $14.  I sat up front thinking they'd be able to get my food done super quick (since there was only one other person in the restaurant).  5 minutes.  10 minutes.  Finally, just over 15 minutes later they had my food ready to go.  The woman up front was plenty friendly, though didn't seem apologetic about the wait.  I guess this is the normal prep time?  I can only imagine what the wait would be like when its busy.  Alright the food.  When I opened up the bag of goodies, the portions weren't what I expected.  For comparison, I would say the burrito I got here is probably about 2/3rds the size of what you'd normally get at Chipotle.  The quesadilla and even the bag of chips they included were also smaller than what a Chipotle would offer by comparison.  That said, the shrimp burrito I got was awesome.  The texture of the tortilla was perfect.  It had plenty of shrimp, avocado, cabbage, pico de gallo, and a surprisingly potent hot sauce.  Very satisfying.  The quesadilla as well as the chips and salsa were also quite good too, though I've certainly had better elsewhere.  So I guess in summary, 4 stars for the food itself, but 2 stars for the rest of the experience.  I'd probably come back if asked, but I would never go the take out route here again.  I suppose their sole focus might be just on those who choose to dine in, rather than those who want to grab and go.  They have other offerings including tacos, some baked pastries and even a decent Mexican beer selection that would probably make this a cool place to hang out with friends.  But for the same price, you can probably get better bang for your burrito buck at Chipotle and other valley Mexican establishments.",

I had the pork, with nothing but beans and rice no sour cream or guacamole as promised Restuarant is clean service was friendly, price was right. The problem was the burrito was not great, just good!

The burrito was incredible; tender pork, flavorful Green Chile sauce, tasty tortilla. The burrito was a good size as well.  If it were a buck or two cheaper I'd be a regular, but nonetheless I will definitely be back from time to time!",

It was hot and fresh took about 15 minutes to prep...so expect that! I'd pass on the Carne Asada Burrito to be honest, you can get a better one in Phoenix at other places I'm sure and I compared it to the last one I had in Tempe.   The owners are friendly, but its kinda pricey, I wish it came with chips. Overall, fat burritos, clean and a cool place to check if in the area!  3 STARS",

I have tried various burritos but fish tacos remain my favorite. They seem to use white fish which doesn't have a distinct flavor so you will essentially get flavors from their sauce and slaw. They don't try to be too fancy with their burritos which works very well for me. I rather taste clean flavors than a mishmash of different sauces.   It is a reliable go-to place when you want something filling and pleasantly flavorful.",

The mature blond lady working behind the counter asked if it was my first time there to which I obviously responded \"yes\". She was extremely friendly and gave me the rundown on what they serve and recommended the green chili pork burrito of which she gave me a small sample. It was delicious! I ordered it and because it was my first time there she threw in a small side of chips and salsa. When I got home and opened the container I was impressed and happy to be greeted with a hot and large burrito that required two hands to pick up. The tortilla was soft but firm. The burrito was filled with the green chili pork and rice(but not too much rice), black beans(pintos and refried are available if thats your preference), cheese and sour cream. The chili had a bright green chili flavor and did have a kick to it but was not too spicy for the average American who likes Mexican food.Everything tasted fresh and their recipe is delicious. It is definitely one of the best burritos I have eaten. I am anxious to try their Carne Asada burrito next!",

The carnitas burrito had great flavor but the meat was a little dry. I suppose that's why you receive  the generous servings of salsa.

Hubs had carne asada burrito and he liked it a lot.  Very flavorful meat but not tender enough for me.... Salsa had a good kick and the chips were good but not warm.  We'll definitely eat here again!  The service was really incredible.  The woman treated us like we were there every night for dinner.  She was incredibly attentive to everyone in there and was commenting on people's new hair styles and everything.  You could tell she knows the regulars and that was so refreshing... It's the kind of service you expect in melrose and being that the place hasn't been there forever it was great to see it!!   Big I could rate on service alone I would give 5 stars... But for a burrito place I'd say it was not incredible not worthy of revisiting.",

The burrito?--Well That is another story. I ordered the \"House Favorite\", which comes with eggs, grilled onions, potatoes, and cheese. While the cheese was melted nicely--The eggs were overcooked-- I asked for both pinto and black beans and I only received a small amount of pinto. The potatoes were soft enough but lacked flavor and were pilled in and overpowered all the other ingredients and my burrito didnt taste fresh---I am guessing they don't clean their grill regularly because it smelled like \"other\" ingredients and made my burrito taste \"un-fresh\" Overall it was one of those DRY burritos. I got through a whole saucer of salsa to make up for the dryness until I said enough is enough. I wouldnt come here for breakfast burritos but YES TO THE MARGARITAS!

In case someone needs to know -- they only use lard in their refried beans and nothing more. I don't do any pig products and I did ask - hopefully that helps someone here.   We will definitely return!",

The beans are also good but the rice needs to be better. Rice lacks flavor and appeal. The carne asada burro doesn't look like much but it is good. The meat is tender and has flavor to it.  The temperature of the food is HOT!You have to pay for chips and salsa. The salsa was very good. Bottled beer and soft drinks are sold as well as Mexican juices. The jamaica was exceptional. Service is good. Only saw two men running the place, and must admit, they did a great job......Gracias!",

The wait time was admittedly longer than expected, but there were many people who called their orders in ahead and received their food first (rightly so).  The portions could have been just a touch bigger, but I was still very satisfied. The horchata was a little too chalky for my taste and didn't have much cinnamon, but I'm pretty picky. Hopefully next time I'll be able to take advantage of happy hour instead!  TLDR; Good prices, great food, and even better service!",

    "text": "Burritos so good they're worth the impending food coma you'll go into after eating them! Seriously, I'm glad I went here on a Sunday because I needed to take a long siesta after munching on these Mexican morsels.   I shared a shredded beef burrito and a green chile pork burrito. Both came out in a speedy amount of time. The server asked if we wanted salsa, I requested one each of the green and red and it came out in a generous portion in little styrofoam cups. The green chile pork was absolutely delicious! The green chile had a lot of savory spicy flavor and the pork was plentiful and tender. The beef was good as well but I really enjoyed the green chile sauce in the other burrito. The salsa was also superb. It tasted freshly made and went well with the burritos. They did seem to forget about the horchata I ordered so I had to remind them at the counter but it was brought right out to me as soon as I mentioned it. The horchata was creamy and sweet, a perfect way to cool down on a hot day.   Service was friendly and sweet. One of the ladies at the counter went to the tables making sure everything was to our satisfaction.",

    "text": "Eh...more like 2.5 stars.  Cinco De Mayo....needed Mexican food.  Was craving a burrito, so I decided to come down here.   Went down, parked in their lot, walked inside and was greeted by a friendly lady who told me she would be right with me.  Browsed the menu for a minute and went with a \"no filler, carne asada burrito\" and added guacamole.  Total was just over $9.00.  They handed me a little placard and I took a seat at one of the tables.  A few minutes later, they brought out my burrito.  Here is how it was.....................  Carne Asada Burrito-  The tortilla looked ok.  It was a bit skimp though.  The burrito was rolled a little bit loose.  I took a bite in and got the carne asada, guacamole and pico all at once.  Carne asada was decent.  Not good, not bad, just decent.  You could tell it was cubed up and griddled on a flat top grill.  It tasted a little bit off, actually.  Not enough seasoning maybe?  Kind of hard to describe.  I made my way down the burrito and added some of the salsa they provide.  It improved it a little bit, but I was still not that impressed.  Down near the bottom, I got some drippage action on the burrito and it was a tad greasy/oily.  Not the worst burrito I have ever had, but far from good, even.  Pretty sure I'm not coming back.  I've had way better carne asada elsewhere, and for $9.00, I wanted more.  Pictures of their pollo asado look ok, so if I do come back (not likely), I may try that out.  Meh....was expecting better based on the average 4.5 star reviews.  Still haven't found a \"good\" burrito in Phoenix :-(",

    "text": "Incredibly happy to say that after trying the PHX Burrito House again, my opinion has improved! And I've discovered that I'm just really not a fan of their green chili burritos. Their verde sauce is fantastic yet the green chili is flavorless and almost creamy instead of saucy. I still found that theilre was way too much tortilla and that I'm not a fan of the flour-y-ness of their freshly made tortillas.  HOWEVER  Their tacos are pretty incredible. Especially their shredded beef and their red sauce beef tacos. The shredded beef was so juicy that the tortilla was falling apart, and the red sauce has none of the problems that the green does.   And my boyfriend tried the choriza and bacon burrito. Which was phenomenal once the grease soaked into the tortilla.   So my suggestion is to try a few things if you're unsure, grab a few tacos and a margarita and you're bound to find something you like.",

    "text": "My son and I had what we think are the best breakfast burrito's we've ever eaten.  Period!  We stopped by two days in a row, since the food was that superb.    This quaint establishment appears to be a converted home, which is exactly the way you feel as you walk thru the doors.  You're immediately greeted warmly by the staff, who will answer any question you might have as you preview the menu.  Don't be shy, since as we found-out, they are very sociable with their customers.    After reading about their breakfast burritos, we just had to have these on our first trip.  The burritos come with potatoes, eggs and beans (if you want), along with your choice of meat.  My son ordered the chorizo and I ordered the sausage.  We grabbed a table and they brought a basket of chips and cup of salsa to our table.  The chips were thick and delish, while the salsa was delicious.  I'd prefer it hotter, but it was full of flavor.  Heck, I could have drank this and been a happy camper.    When they brought our burritos, the first thing you notice is their size.  These aren't your tiny little breakfast burritos like some places serve.  These are made to be grabbed with both hands and enjoyed.  They are also stuffed full with ingredients, so you'd better bring your appetite.  The chorizo was super flavorful and the sausage was also really good.  We were both quite stuffed as we \"rolled\" out the door.    We went back the next day to enjoy lunch, since we didn't get enough the first time.  My son ordered the Enchilada Special and I opted for the 3-Taco Special.  My son's enchilada plate plate took-up the entire plate.  Not to mention the enchilada's were so tender and flavorful.  The red sauce was awesome.  I ordered two of the pork green chile taco's and one carne asada.  The pork green chile is as good as everyone says it is, if not better.  I could literally eat this every day.  The carne asada was tender and flavorful too, so I felt I got the best of both meats.    The service is amazing and the staff are super friendly.  Did I mention how reasonably priced this is as well?  If I'm in the Phoenix area again, I know where I'm going to get a fabulous meal.",

What really disappointed me too, was the fact that neither of their salsas had any heat to them. I wouldn't praise this place for their cleanliness either. I have to say, I was actually let down after my experience here. I just believe the competition is fierce in their niche, and I can't with confidence say that they are quite up to par.   I don't believe I will ever return, just wasn't good enough. The one thing that I did like was the use of fresh jalapenos and not pickled ones from the jar. Their eggs were dry, the meat tasted not just old, but of low-quality. I might as well eat something cheaper; at least I wouldn't be upset with spending so much money.  3 stars",

The food is that good and will have you returning in no time. Thank you for great dining!",

So the burritos come with rice , your choice of beans , your choice of meat , along with the other usual stuff sour cream and so on but they do not skip on anything . This is the spot to go. Also a big thing I love about the place are the people that work there, funny folk which remember your name, now that might be that I have been there to much which in that case I may have an addiction but trust me give it a try.",

After a long wait, the burrito arrived but not my drink.  The waitress retrieved my drink, and I took a bite out of my burrito.  To my disappointment, it had cheese in it, and I returned it to be redone.  The staff took my burrito and commenced a new one.  Without any sense of urgency, I got a new burrito and this time, it was not Carne Asada.  I requested a refund, she attempted to give me an amount less then what I paid and then asked me \"didn't you get a chorizo burrito?\"  I said no.  The staff's incompetence was too frustrating at that point, and I feared that I would say something inappropriate and departed without a refund.  This restaurant needs new wait staff that's competent and caring.  Their ratings will continue to drop to the level of their service regardless of the quality of their food.",

The green chile pork is excellent, and I have had it as both burritos and tacos. The fish tacos are excellent as well.

As I was hesitant on deciding where to go (i hate ruining a craving buzz) I came upon this place on yelp & made it a mission to head here before returning back to Tucson. I am EXTREMELY glad that I did.   My husband and I just wanted something we could share, but in the end I really wish I hadn't! It was THAT good. I stayed outside with our pup, so I was a little nervous on what he ordered. Luckily, he ordered exactly what I wanted.   He ordered us the Breakfast Burrito w/Chorizo as his choice of meat. It was to die for! It came perfectly wrapped (& by this I mean, for ONCE I didn't make a mess because of an opening in my tortilla - we all know what I'm talking about). It was completely stuffed with chorizo, cheese, black beans, green peppers, potatoes, & onions.   It's definitely something that will be forever remembered & craved for.",

The decor in this place is perfect- I love the loteria posters and everything else is just minimal enough to show how spotless it is. The woman at the front (the owner?) greeted us really warmly and then gave us some recommendations- pork green chile burrito and shrimp burrito- and we took her up on the recommendations and I'm so happy that we did. So delicious! The pork was not fatty at all, not too spicy, and the pinto beans complimented it perfectly. The shrimp burrito really blew me away though. Huge chunks of avocado! Perfectly balanced pico and cabbage! And the shrimp were deveined, always a bonus when you forget to ask. We're a five minute walk from this place and it's going to be our new favorite. Sorry about the hideous photo. Not a great good photographer it turns out.",

Due to a slight difficulty one day, Dan offered me a free water (due to the heat) and 50% off my next burrito.  This is great customer service.  I didn't even ask or expect this level of compensation.  It simply appeared to be a natural or automatic response to a small customer inconvenience.  The interior is clean and simple, with ample room for dining.  I have been here a few times now and can safely say that I am a fan.  Their \"special\" carne asada burrito is nicely flavored and has a multitude of little, succulent pieces of properly prepared steak.  I also enjoyed the breakfast burrito, which consists of eggs, potatoes, cheese, and choice of meat.  While not the best I have ever had, they certainly keep me returning for more.  Overall, PHX Burrito House should be applauded for having outstanding customer service and their ability to make a damn good burrito.",

It's pushed back into a little corner with a parking lot that fits a maximum of like 10 cars lol the decor was pretty dope and they have chalked hashtags to use whenever you snap an insta pic of their food (#freeadvertising).  The food was very solid and doesn't deserve anything less than a 4 even on its WORSE day. For me though, it was lacking in flavor that most conventional mexican restaurants tend to give (see my review on Tacochella). Everything was hot and fresh and tasted great, but didnt have that pop to set itself apart from other burrito joints.   I'd come back for sure until they know me by first name and phone number, but they weren't quite deserving of the legendary 5 banger.",

The atmosphere is simple but nice and I love the art on the walls (Mexican lottery prints). We were greeted by who I believe is the owner and she was super friendly. You order at the counter and servers deliver the food to the table. I ordered the chicken tacos and my boyfriend had the special (shredded beef enchiladas). The chicken tacos were simple but tasty. The meat was ground, which was a nice departure from typical chicken taco meat. From what feedback I received on the enchiladas, they were very tasty as well.   I'm compelled now to review after getting burritos for takeout. I got chicken again (I don't eat red meat or pork) and the bf had steak. The ratio of ingredients was solid and satisfying and the tortilla was delicious all on its own (it was somewhat thin but had that nice, chewy texture that I personally very much enjoy). They came served with three types of salsa. I was told the clientele that were there upon pickup were quite hip as well.  Overall, solid experience. Very excited to have a tasty burrito shop so close by to satisfy my frequent taco or burrito craving!",

I may...or may not have had a good buzz going when we stopped in but that doesn't hinder my taste buds.   Not feeling too risky I asked what the most popular item was. I was directed towards the green chile burrito or taco. I'm usually a red chile guy but I took the recommendation and ordered both. The green chile was on POINT! It had just the right amount heat. The corn tortillas were nice and soft. The taco was simple but muy bueno!! The burrito was most definitely the star to me. The beans and the cheese that melted mixed together to make a kick ass sauce that paired great with the spicy green chile. The chips and salsa were tasty and nice much on before our meals. The horchata reminded of how it tasted when I was little and was delicious. I'll be back soon.",

I also ordered a full size chips and salsa.   Major credit to them for actually having a full size order of something that was actually full sized and not over priced in Phoenix.   Let me start by saying I think this place is great for what it is. Actually almost amazing. Its not a super authentic Mexican food spot in my opinion but as a semi American style Mexican food  its great.   The green chili burrito was meaty and had a nice kick to it. The cheese used in the burritos was good quality. And the rice was cooked perfectly. I got mine with refried beans and I was not disappointed in the slightest.  My girlfriend hates refried beans and she actually enjoyed them as far as saying she would order them on the side next time.  The carne Asada burrito was also meaty. For 7$ it was one of the best I've had in Phoenix for the size.   Everything was seasoned really well.  I will definitely be back and this will be in my rotation.",

Based on the reviews, I grabbed a green chile pork burrito as it seemed to be one of their classics. Although the burrito was pretty big for the price, it felt like mostly a rice and beans burrito with a few pieces of meat here and there. I also felt that the tortilla wasn't as good as some other places - mostly the lack of a soft, chewy texture brought this one down. Parking lot was small, but I came after the lunch rush so I'm not sure how well it fares during the meal rush hours. Although I didn't like the burrito I got, I'd be interested in trying a breakfast burrito to give it one last shot.",

I was greeted right away with a friendly smile. The menu is easy to read and ordering is straightforward. I received wonderful service from the workers. I got my tacos and horchata. The tacos were so tasty. I loved the carne asada, pork carnitas, and grilled chicken tacos in that order! The meat were well seasoned and cooked well! The entire experience was awesome! Definitely recommend to friends and family!",

Overall not bad, no real complaints other than it would have been nice to have real silverware available for dining in rather than only plastic utensils. The other thing that I would have liked was having the rice and sour cream on the side by default or asked what I would prefer. I feel that too much rice was used as filler in the burritos. Otherwise I thought the food was pretty good.",

They have delicious Mexican wedding cookies in the front like my Tia makes. The horchata was very good! I got the grilled chicken burrito . It comes with rice I had black beans but you do have a choice of the beans you can choose. Sour cream and I added guacamole. The tortillas are hand made thats the best part. Sad to say when I bit into my burrito when I got home it was the most salty burrito ever! Everything else in it was delicious but the chicken was 2 salty that I could not finish it. The salsa was good and chips were okay. Although the owner did tell me if I did not like it he would buy it for me and give me my money back. But I did take it to go otherwise I feel like he would of had my food redone this is the only reason why I am giving this place 2 stars. I am not sure if I will return right now. If the chicken wasn't salty I would of rated this place to 4.5 stars",

Now I tried the breakfast burrito with bacon, yeah I'm a real health nut, and was really disappointed with the quality. I did like the tortilla, but I found the eggs tasted like they had been sitting on the griddle for awhile and the bacon was so little I think it was only in one bite. Never a good sign when you have to slather the Cholula sauce all over your meal.  I have had much better around the valley and maybe it was just an off day seeing the reviews, or maybe I just ordered the wrong thing.",

I was told it was going to be a 15 minute wait. I don't mind waiting for good food, so I placed my order and waited. My order was brought out to me and I raced home in extreme anticipation. Both burritos were wrong. My bf got chicken, beans, rice, sc, guac, cheese and lettuce. His was missing the guac, sour cream and cheese. I ordered a carne asada with everything. What I received was a carne burrito with only rice and beans. It was bland and some of the carne was gristly. The rice was overdone and the tortillas were made with waaay too much lard. Sorry, first impressions make a big difference to me and I will not be going back.",

I wanted to try a variety of items, so the husband, my dad, and I got a quesadilla, a couple of green chili burritos, guacamole, and a red chili taco... no we didn't try the carne aside, and maybe that was a mistake. I don't really get the hype....the food just wasn't that good. The guacamole was fairly bland. The green chili wasn't spicy and the burrito was overtaken by beans and excess tortilla, dampening any flavor the green chili may have had. Additionally, it wasn't served with any salsa.... and it needed something fresh badly. The red chili taco was a bit spicier, but had an odd smokey flavor that wasn't great. Again, there was no veg on the taco... no cabbage, no peppers, no cilantro....nothing to add any freshness or brightness to the food. I'm not saying the food was bad, but it wasn't great. Maybe we went on an off day, but if this showing was representative of the food here, I can't see myself returning anytime soon.",

I was with my boyfriend and a friend and they gave us a bowl of salsa with our order but no chips... Very weird but we decided to order some chips to actually enjoy the salsa which cost another $3.

I'm not sure if it was really busy or not, but I just didn't feel like we were being treated the best. I told the lady I was there for a pick-up and she went back to get it, even though it was on the counter.   On the way, she dropped our bag on the floor, and picked it up to give it to us, which resulted in our burritos ripping open, which we decided to just take home because it would have taken too long to make another one and we were already over it.    Additionally, my card was charged $150 instead of $15 by another cashier who kept messing up my charge. I will be getting refunded, but it's a Sunday, so not until tomorrow hopefully (Also I am glad I had money in my account so I don't get overdrawn).   Overall, there was just not a lot of communication in the restaurant today and most of the reason we go there is for the service and today I was just not feeling it.   Love the food!

There are always some hard pieces due to being stale or being under cooked.  I got the grilled chicken burrito with black beans.  Everything came together very nicely and it has a unique flavor.  The only complaint I could see people having is that their salsa is really nothing special.  So if you ordered chips and salsa that might be a problem.  I did not find this to be a problem however since the burrito was flavorful enough that I did not need to drench it in salsa like I do at some other places.  Cool unique little dining area too and the employes were all very friendly.  I love places like this with simple menus, that do not do a whole lot, but what they do, they do very well.  I will be back often.",

The restaurant is very hip and inviting and the owners are extremely nice people! I ordered the green chili pork burrito (in which I read came with rice, beans, cheese, and sour cream inside) so I'm thinking it's going to be \"sort of\" like Chipotles. We waited 20-25mins and nothing came out, while others got their food. I finally asked the owner if they forgot my order and he brought it out in less than 3 mins and apologized for forgetting. Yet no biggy for me since I'm a very understanding and patient person. However, the burrito was a decent size but the ratio of ingredients were WAY off, it should have been called a rice and bean burrito with green sauce because I couldn't find more than two small pieces of pork. So in other words, the green chili pork (which is the star of the show) was replaced by rice and beans. Now don't get me wrong, the food was tasty and fresh, and they did give complimentary chips and salsa which were delicious but they have a few things to improve on before I give this place a second chance.",

I entered the establishment and noticed a pretty young Mexican girl working the counter.  I asked for a chorizo breakfast burrito, and she replied \"would you like cheese?\"  I declined. She got me a cup of water and I paid $5.96. I put the 4 pennies in the tip jar. I sat at a table and waited for my burrito. I got my burrito, which came with a fresh salsa. The man who brought me the food grabbed me a spoon and napkin too. Now to the burrito. The tortilla was nice and soft, the whole burrito was very warm. I took a bite; wow, I thought. It was delicious. I ate the whole thing in a matter of minutes. The salsa was just the right amount of spice and accompanied the burrito perfectly. Once I was done, I put my empty water cup, basket, and salsa bowl on the counter and headed toward the door. \"Thank you! Have a great day!\" Said the man and girl in unison. I got back on my bike and took off down the street toward home.",

The first time I had a shrimp burrito and boy did they deliver. Not stingy on the shrimp, every bite had shrimp in it, I could not have been more excited.  Also when you're feeling plain they have simple bean and cheese.  Even on days where you have very specific cravings such as a breakfast chorizo burrito, they can help you out.   This place is really good but I will say they might want to step up their salsa game just a little bit.  With such good burritos you gots to have the spiciness to match.

    "text": "Great tasting Burritos ... you won't be disappointed.  PHX Burrito House is located off the beaten path in the Phoenix area.  I wanted a burrito for lunch and based on my fellow \"yelpers\" reviews I thought I would give the PHX Burrito House  a try and I was very glad I did.   All I can say is don't judge a book by its cover.  From the outside this burrito joint looks like an old house and if you aren't paying attention you will miss it and you don't want to miss this place.  Service is order at the register, then they bring your entree to you. Customer service was really good, friendly and pretty quick.   There is a very good selection of burritos, tacos, and other popular dishes and all are reasonably priced and they taste great.  PHX Burrito house is not a fast food joint, so you get freshly made burritos that are a really good size and they are made with fresh tortillas that are absolutely delicious. The meat is tender and so flavorful. If your in the area you ha email to try this place you won't be dissapointed.",

First off, the woman taking orders was sooo friendly and helpful and it was obvious she enjoyed working there.  While i was waiting for my order She told me about the owners and then talked about their most popular dishes and even brought me a sample of their pork green chili.  Holy crap, that was frickin amazing!  Spicy (which I loved) but seriously great flavor!  I want it so badly now!  Sooo friendly and sweet so huge kudos to her!  Ok now on to the important part... the food!  Yummy!  Homemade tortillas were very obvious since they tasted amazing and super fresh!  The chips were freaking fantastic and were thick but light and crispy. .. again they were obviously homemade.  My carne asada burrito was good but could use some grilled veggies... my bad but I will ask for them next time.  Without a doubt I will be trying their pork with green chili next time since the sample is still dancing in my taste buds.  Ohh guac was superb too... nothing fancy or over the top like some places attempt to do.    Great prices too!!!",

    "text": "Terrible customer service and disgusting food to top it off. Decided to try for first time for lunch. As soon as I walked in the gentleman behind the counter questioned me about \"spreading the word\" about this place, felt almost like he was demanding me to. I kindly responded that it was my first time there that I'm not from the area but would be glad to spread the word. I placed my order and quietly sat by table closest to the register/counter, scoped the place out from there and observed how they worked. Four more customers come in after me, three of which seemed like they had not been there before, they asked about portion sizes, ingredients, etc... They order and find seats to wait, one of them sat at my table since I had an open chair. About fifteen to twenty  minutes later two of the customers that ordered after me got their orders of multiple items and walked out. I saw this and thought that mine should be next. Then the one who ordered last, who is now sitting across from me gets his order, right then I asked the gentleman, same one who asked/ordered me to spread the word,  \"what about my order?\" He shrugged and said he didn't know and walked back to the kitchen. Then he comes out holding some dine-in orders and proceeds to serve other customers. By now about 30 minutes have passed, my lunch hour was almost over, wasted rather. I walk up to the counter upset and ask for my refund, I tell them I don't want my burrito, just my refund so I can return to work on an empty stomach. The gentleman gives me a weak incoherent apology, opens the register, and explains that all those people he served before me had placed phone-in orders and I should do the same next time. That's what pissed me off!  I called him a liar, told him that he was insulting, especially when I was able to hear all of those people's orders from where I was sitting. He hands me my refund, I said \"thank you for ruining my lunch\" and turn and leave, angry and hungry, hangry. As I get in my car they walk up apologizing, and hand me my order. I said \"thank you but it's ok, I don't want it\". The gentleman was persistent, apologized some more and explained I didn't have to pay for it. I took the burrito so that they would leave so I could back out and head back to work, with no plans on eating this burrito. I was persuaded to at least try the burrito which I regretted immediately. It was so salty, no flavor, just salt. It ended up in the trash bin.   To management: If you make a mistake, own it, don't try to come up with a lame excuse, while at the same time insulting a customer! Also, cut back on the salt please! The tortillas, the meat, the salsa, they were all salty. Unless you made it salty especially for me, to rub some salt on the wound... Again, thank you for ruining my lunch.",

I'm not sure if they're suppose to hand out chips and salsa but I had asked if they had a house salsa of some sort, mind you i only wanted the salsa but it seems like the owner brought out chips and salsa, on the house. Which i thought was a nice gesture whether it was a standard or thoughtful of him. Food was delicious.  So I decided to come back a second time to try out the shrimp burrito and honestly, it was disappointing. Felt like the ingredients lacked something that I cannot wrap my tastebuds around. It tasted good overall, ingredients were fresh but burrito itself left desiring something else. The only saving grace to that burrito was their salsa which was terrific and it added depth to the burrito.  Their food is still tremendous and I will gladly come back.",

Arrived no California burrito, but they did have an assortment of burritos and tacos.  My order came to $20 plus tip.  Burrito was average, nothing popped, pinto beans were bland, saw some rice not much else.   Same for 3 tacos, $7 plus dollars, but uneventful along with bland salsa. Staff real nice.

With the plethora of good Mexican restaurants in the Phoenix area, I wouldn't call this my go-to spot but they definitely have a burrito worth trying.   My main complaint is that I have gotten take out from this place twice now and both times they have messed up something. For example, today I ordered two burritos to go (not both for me, one was for my wife. Cmon, I can't eat two of these burritos..or could I?) Anyways, today they forgot to put the rice and beans in my wife's red chili burrito which was pretty disappointing. I think they just need to be a little more careful with their to go orders since this has happened twice to me now.",

I think you have to know the ropes like ordering online. If you walk in there's no one there but there could be dozens of orders before you so it might take...who knows how long. I thew in the towel at 15 minutes. And there's no chips or anything to do while you wait. Maybe if you eat in they give you something. Otherwise...stare at the wall. I would have ordered a drink and enjoyed myself if they'd given me a clue that it was going to take so long.",

I state all the above because we had trouble finding it the first time around (at night). Fish tacos outta this world, so flavorful and fresh. The fish are my favorite.  Pork carnitas taco- perfectly cooked carnitas, seasoned & shredded just the way grandma did it. A squeeze of lime made it perfect. Carne asada tacos tasted good, seasoned right, though I'd say just a little bit dry. Again, nothing some salsa & lime couldn't fix. The grilled chicken tacos were so good, very juicy, had such great flavor with a hint of lime/ lemon. All the tacos (except fish) are accented lightly with cilantro & onion. No heavy onions which was a great relief for my onion-hating boyfriend. He was able to pick them out with ease in a matter of seconds. (actually I picked them out...). A nice selection of salsas, all freshly made. I've been here twice, will be back again. Great happy hour starting at 2:30 with bottled beers & margaritas starting at $3.  Staff is very friendly. Bonus points for great customer service!",

The order: A pork in green chile burrito, with rice, pinto beans, sour cream, and cheese and a carnitas burrito, with rice, pinto beans, cheese, and light on the sour cream.  The food: Amazing and definitely hit the spot. I loved the pork in green chile. It a good amount of meat with the perfect amount of green chile so your burrito isn't soaked and falling apart. The carnitas burrito was dry in comparison to the pork in green chile but that's not a bad thing, just a matter of what you're feeling - they were both really tasty. Tortilla was not too thick, and I really appreciate that the sour cream was well spread out, not a huge dallop in a corner of my burrito. The cheese was melted and went so well with the consistency of my pork in green chile burrito. Portion sizing, was perfect - it was extremely filling.  The service: Very friendly and on top of it. I think our order was forgotten but the cashier noticed we'd been sitting in the corner for a little too long and came out with a serving of chips and salsa, on the house, right after she went into the kitchen to check on our order. I was a little hungry but she handled the situation well and I have no complaints.  The verdict: So worth the drive, we'll be back!",

I seriously don't know why any Phoenician would ever ever ever set foot in a Chipoltle when they could go here. One, it's local. Two, it has the same options as Chipoltle (rice/beans/meat/etc) and is ten MILLION times more delicious. The carne asada falls apart in your mouth and is seasoned very well. The carnitas are amazing, and one burrito was seriously the size of my face. When I dined in, I got complimentary chips and salsa and they were delicious.  Service is probably the only difference when comparing to Chipoltle. PHX Burrito House cooks up your food and brings it out to you, thus meaning it takes a little bit longer, but it's fresher. The wait can easily be avoided by calling ahead and placing a to-go order if you're in a lunch rush.   So next time you're craving a giant, meaty (or beany or veggie) burrito, skip the national chain and go to PHX Burrito House. You will not be disappointed.",

All that said: The breakfast burritos here are The Best. If I'm not out of town, I'm here at least once a weekend. Doesn't matter if it's 10am or 3pm, some day that weekend I'm devouring a breakfast burrito here. The potatoes & eggs are cooked in just the right way and amount that they're guaranteed to slay any hunger or hangover you may walk in with. The ham/sausage options are excellent, but my heart will forever be caught in the ages old battle waged between bacon and chorizo (chorizo usually wins). The red salsa just completes the masterpiece.  Not to mention, the managers/owners are kickass. If they know you, they'll probably know if you need some water, how much salsa you need, and if you want chips (without even saying it) in the morning(ish). And sometimes they'll sit down and chat with you over their own burrito.  I've grabbed tacos here a few times as well, and they're also excellent. I can't imagine these guys doing anything average.",

    "text": "Top Notch Mexican food right here! Thanks Yelpers! I went here because of the great reviews.  I don't even remember the last time I actually ate a burrito. I typically stay away from them because they're a sloppy mess that are difficult to eat, and not very enjoyable.  I decided to give one a try here. If there was a place to eat one, I guessed it would be a place named: PHX Burrito House.  I went for a Carnita Burrito with refried beans, and while I waited for it, I enjoyed the BEST tortilla chips I have had in Phoenix, and some of the best I have had in my life. Super fresh and crispy, not greasy, not over-salted. The Salsa was fantastic as well. Little chunky, little spicy, great flavor. I was also treated to a small bowl of the Famous Pork with Green Chiles. Super tender pork with a delicious green salsa.(They also have a burrito with this) The burrito came out and it didn't disappoint! They don't try winning you over with an enormous burrito, they put all of their love into a medium sized perfectly rolled bundle of goodness with a nice firm tortilla. The Carnitas were great, rice was delicious, creamy refried beans. And how does one judge a burrito? Well, I cut it in half and each half held together until it was gone! Most places fall apart after a few bites!  Its a cruise for me, but a place I will definitely visit when in the area.  STOP going to those Chain-o-Berto type places and eat REAL Local Mexican Food instead!",

Chips, salsa, and food are brought to the table.  The salsa is the bomb!  Spicy, not to chunky, and compliments the lightly salted chips.",

My fiance & I made a completely random stop here during apartment hunting in the area, just to sit down for a drink & talk over our findings. We are from Indiana & were only in town for a couple days, getting ready for our big move from Indiana to Arizona. We only had drinks, chips & salsa, but I already told them we will be back once we are in town in July! Chips are very authentic tasting & I cannot wait to check out many of their other menu items. I'm big on Mexican food & I can see myself stopping in here often! This place reminded me of a coffee shop but for burritos & I thought it was so cool! The owner came around the counter, shook our hands, introduced himself, welcomed us to Arizona and told us briefly about his move to Arizona years ago! We loved the hospitality & we will be back ASAP!!! :)",

The good: Fresh ingredients and well priced The bad: The food was just ok (relatively bland).  The first time, it took over 30 minutes for our food to come out (which is always fun with little kids...) but the second time it was a bit faster.  With so many fantastic options for Mexican food in the valley, we won't be returning.",

I've been three times now, and had different items each time. Everything is great! The fish tacos, the shrimp burrito, the steak tacos, the breakfast tacos, everything! The tortillas had a great texture and flavour. Loved the cartinas!  You should go check it out!",
