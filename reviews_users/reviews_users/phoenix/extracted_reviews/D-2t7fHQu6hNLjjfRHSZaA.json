    "text": "I'm in love. Evo's got a good thing going here, and if you haven't been yet then you need to go! Chef Chops cooked my girl friends and I such an amazing feast.   We began with the most beautiful charcuterie board, with cheeses, meats, spreads, and a bunch of yummy pickled items. Then we moved on to a delicious creamy burrata appetizer, followed by some arancini (fried risotto balls with a meat sauce), and house meatballs in a red sauce.   In between all these carbs and heavy-ish items, we sampled a beet salad as well as a broccoli stalk prepared with some pine nuts and I think a lemon sauce.   We also shared the fungi pizza, the roasted chicken entree, and one of the pasta dishes which sadly I can't remember the name of. Honestly everything was so good, there was nothing I didn't like. You can tell the staff has pride in their jobs and their products. Our server was a doll too.   If you check in on yelp you get a shot of Fireball for a penny. Which is awesome.",

    "text": "We had an excellent dinner Friday night at this little gem of a restaurant. We arrived at 7:15, and were surprised to not find this place packed. We sat at the bar and had drinks while waiting for our friends to arrive. The bartender was friendly and efficient, and the drinks were delicious.   We moved to the dining area for dinner, and were greeted by our waiter. He provided us with the specials and grabbed us more drinks. We ordered the kale salad to start, and it was incredible. The dressing was a house balsamic, and the vegetable mix was perfect. Extremely impressed.   Dinner arrived shortly after, and it was incredible. We ordered the bolognese bad the chili shrimp pasta. Both were delicious.  This restaurant had a very hip atmosphere, attentive service, and the manager ensured we were enjoying our evening. We will definitely be back.",

Perfect combination of savory and sweet. I love that the menu had a few traditional classics on it, but also some items that I would never think to try (but did) that were delicious. Our server was very attentive. This place would have gotten five stars if the food wasn't so expensive. I suppose it makes sense for the area though! I will absolutely be back!",

On first impression, it seemed trendy but it's actually really casual. A little dark inside but comfortable.  Cocktails were great, and so were the pastas. My lobster pasta was strong and the homemade pasta was clearly homemade. Very fresh and had the right texture and that \"pasta\" taste that so few restaurants get right.  Service was good, and prices were reasonable. Spent around $40 per person with drinks and tax/tip.",

The bartender was in the process of making a drink only to find out it was the wrong one that someone else had ordered and set it aside.... I ordered the  Grapefruit Basil Martini about 10 min. later and low and behold, guess which drink he handed me..... yep, the one pushed to the side.  Really can't believe he did that knowing I was sitting there when the mistake occurred and that I overheard everything. Thanks, I'll pass... So, I ordered something else only to get Half a drink in a small squatty goblet type glass they use. Needless to say, not a great start.  I ordered the caesar salad... The dressing seemed really \"light\" or possibly watered down... the flavor was almost non-existent.  Next, ordered the Heirloom Tomato pasta.... That was very good, however, it was described as cappellini and it was actually a wider pasta like fettuccine.",

We ordered the Arancini, meatballs and charred octopus for appetizers and all were magnificent.  The meatballs were probably the best I have ever eaten.  We split a Caesar and my wife ordered a small pepperoni pizza and I had the pasta Bolonese for entrees.  All menu items were done to perfection.  Service was excellent and the House Cabernet was very drinkable unlike House wines served in many restaurants.  I was surprised by the reasonable pricing on food this good.  atmosphere is dark and romantic.  Leave the kids at home.  Have told all of our friends and will come back soon.  One minor item unrelated to food is that the like fixtures and chandeliers are in need of cleaning.  Thanks for a great evening",

    "text": "I came here with two other gals to celebrate my coworker's big 2-9. She'd heard good things about EVO and scooped up a Local Dines deal so we were ready and excited to try the place out.  We walked in a tad late (sorry!) for our 8:00 reso on a Saturday night. The place wasn't PACKED, but had a healthy amount of tables. A bachelorette party, a large birthday gathering, a few couples at two-tops and a few other girl groups filled about half the dining room.  Service was a little confused at first. I'm not sure if they have sections or if one server was in the weeds or what, but we had both a guy and girl start off greeting us, then the girl took our drink order, then the guy came back for our drink order. It was figured out though, and we perused the short and sweet menu. We looked at the appetizer section but they all seemed a little too heavy. In other reviews it seems like they got bread/olive oil before their meals came? We didn't get that.  I opted for the vegetable risotto, which was completely delicious. It wasn't a bogged down risotto (I mean, it was as \"light\" as a risotto can be), with ample amounts of veggies dispersed throughout the dish. It was perfect for spring. The two other girls I was with got the Alfredo with chicken, which also didn't look too heavy or drowning in white sauce either. That's a nice touch with Italian food.  I felt like our server wanted to strangle us when we ordered a 2nd bottle of bubbly--maybe that's just my years of service industry talking but it just seemed like she didn't. wanna. be there. Hey, we were celebrating a birthday! When we were ready to leave, splitting the check and putting on the Local Dines deal was no problem, so that was nice.  All in all, I'd definitely go back to EVO; the food was really delicious. I just won't go RUNNING back.",

Pasta was a little on the heavy side. Maybe whole wheat? Overall, an ok dish. Not great, but not bad.   A little too dark for my taste. Needed phone to read the menu.   Serve was very good.

    "text": "So writing this is awkward.. but what was even more awkward was our dining experience the other night. On a serious note: if I wouldn't have been so happy to be with my friends (one of whom was visiting from SF) I think I would have flipped a tit at this experience in its entirety!  Lets start from the beginning - EVO is a nice restaurant. I have never been blown out of my mind, but I have never been disappointed either... until now.  We arrived at 7 and got seated right away--things started off ok. I am not sure if our server ever told us his name but either way, he got us some water and got our drink order. It took a little long for the wine to come out but whatever-- things happen, who cares. Us girls hadn't seen each other in quite sometime so we had immediately started talking and got caught up telling stories. Our server came back and asked \"what he could get us.\" We had a few apps picked out and he also recommended another one. We were all STARVED so we thought the more the merrier! - Check - got the apps ordered.   He started to walk away, leaving me confused over my empty wine glass... he didn't ask if I wanted another. \"Ah excuse me sir may I have another glass of wine... thanks.\" Wine came out (great) we get back to our conversation, intense gossip stories :). These stories were going and going and then I started to think...(This is where it gets awkward,) 'we ordered our apps like 30 minutes ago where are they?' I was not the only one in out group to take note of the incessant delay either. I was so very in to this story thought so I thought I would let it go, and maybe 15 minutes later they finally came out. We all noted how annoying it was but got over it, who cares, we're hungry, lets eat! So start eating our \"APPETIZERS\" and continued conversation only, fifteen minutes later....where did our server go?? Crickets... Bueller?? Bueller?? Oh there you are, and thanks for stopping by to drop a few ice cubes in the water glass, where is the water though? This is where it gets good...  (30 minutes later..) Server comes back...  \"So, could I offer you dessert?\"  Our reply... \"ummm we haven't even ordered our dinneryet, can we maybe do that and also get some butter cake if we are doing this all at once?\" Salads and desserts came out at the same time. At this point we don't even care so we eat it all at once. Finish that.. HELLO where are you now!!! CHECK PLEASE, hello??? 20 minutes later got the check and pay.  By far, this was the most awkward restaurant experience I have ever had and I hope to God if I ever end up back at this restaurant that this sever is no longer employed. I guess not everyone fits the bill.  XOXO",

Bruschetta and the balls with pasta inside (can't remember what they are called). Every single thing we tried was fantastic! We got the lobster risotto, so amazing! We also splurged and got dessert-- the butter cake--to die for. It would be worth it to go here for the dessert alone. To sum up, there aren't a ton of places in Scottsdale that I can say the food is amazing. Lots of awesome spots for ambiance, drinks, etc. but this place is a great atmosphere and truly delicious. Check it out!",

Can't remember what (obviously unmemorable) failed restaurant EVO replaced in it's current location, but I came here for a late lunch and was the only customer.  In a nutshell, my \"specialty\" drink was boring, food was under-seasoned and bland, and service was spotty and sometimes slow.   I ordered a portobello mushroom sandwich which, when it arrived, looked like it was made with plain white bread from the '60s.  I picked up the top slice of the bread and flipped it over. It was completely burnt on the underneath side and totally untoasted on the top. The same was True for the other bottom piece of bread on the sandwich. It looked as if it was positioned that way to hide the \"burntness.\"   Not a good experience. Maybe dinner is better. I'll never know.",

I got the margarita, but the one on the menu was no longer available so the bartender made me a pomegranate one ($13). It was really, really good! (I may have gotten two.) Service was great and our waitress was really cool, always refilling our waters and very attentive. We also got the butter cake for dessert which was good. It was a little too sweet for me but the others loved it. A little pricey as our meal was over $120 for the 3 of us.... but we all got at least one drink so it really wasn't bad. Great place.

    "text": "My friends and I whom are all from Scottsdale and Paradise Valley decided to check out this restaurant / bar this past Sunday as we had heard good things about it. We generally spend Sundays bouncing around to different places in oldtown trying different food and drink. As we entered we were greeted with a very friendly hello and welcome to Evo and we indicated we were simply going to the bar.  It is a very nice atmosphere and somewhat different from most of what Scottsdale has to offer.  Not that Scottsdale doesn't have many very nice and interesting places this just seem to have a different atmosphere.  We were there to take advantage of the happy hour pricing, enjoy a drink and to check the place out so we moved up to the bar.   The individual behind the bar looked to be a very happy individual however to get their attention as we were the only four people sitting at the bar one would think it shouldn't take too much effort, but it did.  They were busy taking inventory and that seemed to be more important than greeting us and  engaging us in general banter and conversation again since we were the only four there.  I must say as a disclaimer I am not certain what the bar puts more priority on, the customers or the inventory again as it was our first time there.  When I paid my tab it did not seem as though we were given the happy hour pricing but I didn't mind so much as it was a good and different drink.  I will perhaps check this place out again as I never make my final opinion on first experience however if 2nd time going is like the first I won't return.  I cannot and will not speak for the other members in my party this is simply my opinion. P.S. the food menu looked good.",

Perfect for date nights, happy hour, group dinners, I love it!! They had live music last Sunday, acoustic amazing-ness lol. So many wines to choose from, I really liked the variety of reds. Fireball on tap!!!?? Wow, thats different and exciting for you whiskey drinkers!! Great spot, and if the rest of the menu is anything near as wonderful as what I've had, well - I can't wait to try it all!!!",

The food was good and wanted recommendations from our server to order more.  Our server, Jharnys (from our receipt) was rude and annoyed when asked for his opinion.  It ruined the whole experience that dessert wasn't ordered.  I will definitely say yes to the food but no to the service, thanks to our server the restaurant gets 2 stars.  I will most likely not return and will not recommend it to fellow friends and colleagues that live or visit the city.",

There were six of us ordering appetizers, main dishes, and deserts - one salad and one main dish were sent back to the kitchen.  Eggplant was undercooked, absolutely raw and flavorless inside, beet salad consisted of a truck load of arugula with few slices of beet (served on a cheese board, not in a plate - super inconvenient to eat), pizza was not baked through, steak came with overcooked boiled potatoes on a side, gelato should have been served under the name of a milk shake - it came completely melted.   The wine was good and our waiter was very nice, but it does not make up for the sloppy cooking.",

Tonight tasted like chili peppers and water on pasta . Order the Cacio E Pepe it's suppose to be cheesy and creamy. NO it was pasta that was cooked unevenly not creamy not cheesy no flavor at all. Thank goodness to end with the butter cake it was divine. The rest of the food missing flavor and salt. Such a waste of money.",

Shame on me for thinking such a thing. Our server was very attentive to the number of people we had. He brought over a few chairs to ensure that everyone was comfortable. We must have had a minimum of 6 checks and he did spectacular at not mixing them up. The sangria is where it was at for me. Additionally the pizza I had was delicious as was the bruschetta.   I had expected it to be a little more costly than it was but for as much food and beverage that I had it wasn't too bad at all.  The location is a little hidden and the parking lot may be difficult during busy hours however, I believe we got the just in time. Anyhow, the staff was friendly and the food and drinks were good.

    "text": "Recently had the chance to grab brunch at EVO with my wife. Well -- when we had brunch she was my fiance, now she's my wife.  EVO was THAT GREAT!   OK, well, even if it wasn't EVO that did the trick, it was none the less awesome food.     I had the Pork Belly Quiche, and it was delicious.  Even with pork belly, I feel like it was a relatively healthy dish.  If you like quiche and you like bacon, you absolutely cannot go wrong with this.   My wife had the Mascarpone Waffles and they, too, were delectable.   She reported that they were so good they didn't need syrup.   When's the last time you had a waffle that good?   It was quite difficult to actually make decisions on the brunch menu -- everything sounded appealing.  It would have been great to have tried it all, but we'll just have more to be excited about when we return for future brunches.    Presentation was nice on all counts as well -- great food with a great look!    Do you like mimosas with your brunch?  They do a great job of that.  I happen to have a Bloody Mary obsession, however, so was very happy to find that EVO has a little bloody mary bar set up.   They'll bring you a generous pour of your choice of vodkas then you saunter over and load up on all the goodies you want including their house made bloody mix (yum!) various spices, sauces and garnishes, including the beloved bacon garnish.  Just as nice for those who like a good bloody mary but aren't interested in the whole DIY thing -- the server will make your drink for you if you like.  Just say so.   Of course they do have a full bar so your options aren't just limited to mimosas and bloodies.    Finally, loved the decor.  Warm, inviting, upscale, yet laid back spot in a great location.   Walking distance to a lot of other retail and entertainment.   Talked with one of the gracious owners while there as well and learned that as of the time of our meal, this was a brand new brunch menu.  Cheers to keeping it fresh!     Very much looking forward to doing brunch at EVO again and I have a feeling it will be like a gateway drug, with dinner being the eventual next step. If the dinner menu is as creative and tasty as the brunch menu, EVO is an all around winner!",

    "text": "Amazing customer service, food, and swanky ambiance! First, they were able to kindly accommodate my last minute reservation change on a busy Saturday night. When I made the original reservation, I put it under my name, but noted we were going for my sister's bachelorette party. When my sister arrived in her \"bride to be\" tiara, the hostesses excitedly asked if she was the bachelorette - which made her feel special. We were seated at a large high top near the bar. With a daily happy hour from 4-7 (rare in Scottsdale), we were able to get $5 glasses of wine - that didn't taste cheap, along with $5 well drinks. Already incredible value. We then split the HH Bolognese fries - their bolo is SO flavorful, and the warm Brie and honey \"Focatccia rustica\" per our server's recommendation, which were both to die for and great for sharing. We all got incredible meals, without a complaint. I personally loved my pappardelle bolognese so much, I ate the whole large portion. I heard great things from the table about the Lobster carbonara gnocchi - worth the price. The server asked us if we'd like to keep one of the menus, as they had printed a special copy, congratulating my sister on her engagement at the top. Incredible extra touch. After our meals, a bartender brought my sister a complimentary \"blowjob shot\" and allowed us to make a scene as we taped her taking the shot. We then joined in for a few more rounds of shots. Lastly, the head manager/owner (I'm not sure) came by to ensure we were enjoying our night, which we were. The line of hungry patrons was growing quickly, so after due time, we gave up our spot - but would have stayed forever if not. Will definitely be coming back, and would recommend it to anyone planning a special event. EVO really goes above and beyond!!",

EVO solidifies this area, along with Franco's and Marcellino's as the Valley's \"Little Italy\".  We welcome back the original 'Cuoco Pazzo', Chef DeRuvo and he brings back many of the dishes that we have loved at his past spots, namely the Raviolo, Arancini, and Focaccia di Recco.  The only mild disappointment was the Squid Ink Chittara which was a little too soupy and clumpy for my taste.The ambiance and bar are nice enough but the draw for me is what is being made back in the kitchen.",

The atmosphere was quaint and personal with the ability to be yourself without sticking out (jeans or slacks, t shirts and fancy dresses). We have already recommended to friends.

I definitely recommend, if you like trying something unique. It's worth the adventure.   The chili shrimp pasta was good, it just didn't wow us. Overall I have no complaints about the restaurant at all. They Yelp fireball shot is a great perk. I would go back again just can't quite give it 4 stars.",

The dish was rich, buttery, cheesy and the pancetta (or was it bacon) on top pushed the dish over the edge into the sublime.   We also had the crispy risotto which came in a red sauce and that dish too, was delicious.   Our server was knowledgeable and efficient.

It is the perfect combo of crispy and smooth, sweet and salty, hard to describe, but absolutely spot on.  I love the Gorgonzola Pizza just as much, I actually just ate my last piece as a late night snack and was wishing that I had saved a few more slices!  If you like thin crust and  blue cheese, this is for you, the honey drizzled on top really makes the dish.  Finally, I always get the Chocolate Torte, it's a chocolately, marshmellowy, deconstructed little number with a bit of crunch to keep it interesting.  Bottom line, you will love the food at this place, and the ambiance is beautiful as well.",

    "text": "First visit led to mixed feelings. We went during Restaurant Week. The place was not crowded but there were lots of problems. This is a noisy place. We asked to be moved away from the bar but that put us next to a speaker. It was hard to hear the waitress.  Fortunately we left as the live music started.   We were urged to get the meatball appetizer which we all ordered. Three minutes later we were told they were out. Food is not delivered by the waitress but rather other staff.  Each course there was confusion as there was food delivered wrong. At the last course there was a missing dessert and an extra of another dessert. When we got the bill I wasn't charged for my wine and the other couple not charged for their wine but charged in error for something else. Food was not always delivered hot. The wine pairings were good. Food quality was not high in our opinion but that might be our judgment.",

    "text": "I am not usually one to write a review for yelp. However, I was so very impressed with my experience at EVO last night I felt motivated to share. After getting off work late, (around 10pm) I was looking for a place I could eat late that wasn't typical bar food. My boyfriend recommended EVO saying it was good food and friendly service. This was an understatement. Upon arriving, I was pleased with the atmosphere. Hip, with good music, where you could still easily enjoy conversation. We sat at a beautiful bar with smiling bartenders who handed us menus without being asked and helped me find a wine I enjoyed. We were then greeted by the Chef, Chops, who knew my boyfriend but was meeting me for the first time. I was so impressed by his enthusiasm for the food and his warm, welcoming demeanor, just a great guy! He recommended a few plates including the Charcuterie, Broccoli, and EVO Salad. I was starved and could not wait to eat but was not prepared for the awesome amount of food placed in front of us. The Charcuterie was HUGE and had an incredible assortment of flavors, including a number of new surprises. The Broccoli, also a large portion, transformed a simple vegetable into an awesome meal. The EVO salad was full of new flavors as well and will become a staple for me at EVO. Overall, our experience was such that I can not wait to return, try more of the menu, and enjoy great service. Nicely Done EVO!",

I find myself going at least once a week because they have their happy hour until 7, which is great for me and my girlfriends because we get off work at 6 and most happy hours are over by then. And to top it off I love sitting at the bar when Dominic is bartending because he is hilarious and has amazing customer service. Also the owner Nick is a gem you can totally tell his passion is the restaurant business, always taking the time to get feedback and make sure everyone is having a great time! LAST THING- The bolognese is my favorite I get it almost every time! :)",

    "text": "I'm slowly learning I shouldn't listen to servers when ordering food. I had been eyeing the eggplant ragout, but was swayed by our waitress who highly recommended the zucchini pasta. (She did mention she loves it partly because it's healthier than pasta). And if you are looking for a healthy option it definitely seems like a good choice. It's literally strips of zucchini (NOT zucchini based noodles) covered in veggies and sauce.  However, when I go out to eat I like to do it up and regretted not ordering the ragout. I noticed a lot of people around  us ordered the bruschetta and meatball plate.   We ordered butter cake for dessert and I would recommend especially if you prefer your butter cakes a little fluffy/sponge cake like. This place is pretty trendy and entices your typical Scottsdale crowd.  Tables are rather close which makes it noisy, but overall it's a great place if you're in Scottsdale and looking for Italian.",

We had the beets salad and ricotta dumplings for appetizers and they were complementary to our meals, which were flat steak and Chile shrimp pasta!! My husband had the flat steak and I've never seen him crush food that fast . The Chile shrimp pasta had the perfect amount of kick and its sauce was creamy, tangy, and refreshing with sprigs of mint. For dessert, we had the brown butter baby cake and Belgian chocolate gelato. The brown butter baby cake was the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a>. I'm a huge fan of dessert and I could honestly say that it was the best dessert I've ever had!! The belgian chocolate gelato was great too!! It was perfectly creamy and had the perfect balance between sweetness and bitterness!! I would DEFINITELY recommend people coming here!! And the servers were amazing too!",

I suggest starting with the calamari. The lemon butter sauce they serve with it is so light and delicious. Recently, they added a Zucchini pasta to the menu! YUM! You can get your pasta and be healthy too. I would definitely suggest trying it out. The pomodoro sauce is so rich and the noodles really do taste similar to pasta. EVO always has great daily specials. Last night if you bought a bottle of wine you got a free pizza! Woohoo If you've never been, go check it out now!",

Servers always knowledgeable about flavor profiles for wine and cocktails and provide perfect recommendations. Fantastic dining experience. The food is always fresh and delicious. Plenty of vegetarian options. Margherita flatbread is heavenly. Zucchini noodles are light and flavorful.   Have been meaning to mention a spectacular experience with Audrey as our server in the main dining room. Despite having a full section, Audrey was attentive and made good conversation in addition to providing great service. I was dying to figure out a wine I tried here prior and Audrey was able to name it for me after chatting about the flavor. That being said, I highly recommend the Ionis ater primivito di manduria 2013 if it is still on their menu.",

Service was excellent and they had a special on a bottle of the house wine with our meal--and it wasn't a cheap wine as is often the case but a Tom Gore, which is a rather decent cab. Their happy hour lasts everyday until 7:00pm, which means your first glass for dinner as well as appetizers may be priced less. We had their calamari and meatballs (which were very good). I had the beef ribs and mashed potatoes w spinach. It was very good, although the meat was somewhat fatty although flavorful with a rich sauce. My daughter ordered the lobster dish which she loved.  The dessert was their house special that takes an extra 30 minutes to serve, so they ask that you order it early. Honestly, it tastes like a warm donut, so it was my least favorite item. However, given the ambience, service and good food, we will return and try it again. Parking was also easy in the lot right next to the restaurant.",

Came for a birthday party and although there were 12 of us, we waited an absurd amount of time to order drinks, then the appetizers, then the food.   I ordered an evosalad, which was so terrible, that i couldn't even eat it. The main entree was a squid ink seafood pasta, again, grossly disappointing.   Will definitely not be coming back to this restaurant,  and highly recommend Marcellino's for anyone wanting excellent Italian.",

When we're finally seated we ordered about $230 of drinks and food. When the check case, we went to submit our passport card, they said they no longer took it however the application still had them listed. They continued to say they would not honor it and the waiter decided to change his vibe as soon as showed him the passport.  We Are from out of state. We went to this place specifically because of the passport card. After 15 minutes of annoyance, they honored it. It is not the consumers responsibility to report to passport to remove the company.  This was totally embarrassing. We brought family here who are Arizona natives and they did consider returning to Evo but now hey are not happy with the response.",

The host was so friendly and offered us options for various tables on a fairly crowded evening) and the waitress gave us her favorites dishes (which weren't just the most expensive options.)  I recommend the meatball appetizer, lasagne, and bread cake with raspberries. Side note - the dessert takes 25 minutes to make.) it's worth every minute!!!! Thank you for such a delightful evening.

For an appetizer we ordered the arancini which was flavorless and slightly cold in the middle - obviously a frozen item which was reheated. The supposed handmade pasta for the carbonara and chicken marsala were tough and chewy. Not to mention both dishes were way over salted to cover up for the terrible cooking.  The only plus for this place that I can see is the ambience. But if you're looking for GOOD Italian food, go somewhere else.",

My wife had the Lobster Carbonara which she says was the best lobster she has had and the pancetta helped make the dish. For desert we had and would also highly recommend the Brown Butter Babycake.

Warm, crispy Brussels sprouts, kale, pancetta, Bosc pears, goat cheese, pine nuts, & aged balsamic. Taste bud orgasm. I came for restaurant week: got this salad, the espresso-crusted steak, and Nutella budino. The main course and dessert were delicious, but the EVO salad was hands down the star of my entire experience! I sat at the bar so I can't speak for table service, but my experience was fantastic. They have comfortable, aesthetically pleasing bar stools, gorgeous chandeliers throughout the space, at least two large HD flat screen TV's playing the latest sports or popular show, and a nice little patio outside for anyone who can't go an hour or two without a cigarette.  EVO is a place I can see myself driving the 20 min from my house to eat/drink at, because although it's located in Scottsdale, it's blessedly not a \"Scottsdale\" establishment, at least not in the bar area. I found it to be filled with fellow industry folk who are intelligent, know a lot about food, wine, cocktails, etc, and don't care about appearances as much as one might expect in an establishment in this zip code. EVO is not only a beautiful establishment with outstanding food, they also have an impressive hold on the industry. I believe there are industry offerings most nights: Tuesdays offer $5 tap wines, $4 Fernet and Chartreuse!!, and discounted beers for industry associates, $20 for a bottle of wine and a pizza on Wednesdays (maybe for everybody?), etc. Although we don't need an incentive to frequent EVO, the fact that they respect their fellow servers, bartenders, and restaurant workers is one of the many ways they keep us coming back for more.",

We were sat down immediately at the reserved table and there was enough space between all 12 of us to be comfortable.  I try to make it a point to remember the waiter/waitress names in order to give them recognition, but I didn't finish this review the same night like I meant to.  However our waitress was very patient due to the amount of unorganized individuals that we were sitting with in taking our orders.  Not to mention when we received our food and drinks there were no misses!! The pizza I had, tasted home made and was very fresh.  The drink I had was very basic so I can't really elaborate on that.   I must say the main thing that stuck out, which I have never seen before was that they wished my brothers girlfriend a happy birthday on their food menu!! Completely original and awesome to me!  Felt very exclusive and personal.  I can see me coming to EVO often.  The lights were dimmed and it was very intimate, with candlelight's glowing.. great first experience!",

The two with me had the bolognese which the server recommended and it was good. I tried the orecchiette which was a fennel sausage pasta, it was salty but good.   I would go here again and try their menu items, some looked really interesting but the service was pretty slow. Maybe it was because we sat outside.",

I've had just about everything on the menu and their heirloom tomato (add meatballs) is my go-to most of the time, but the Evosalad (crispy Brussels sprouts, kale, chevre, pear, pancetta, pine nuts and balsamic) is incredible! They recently added the Focaccia Rustica (creme de brie, mascarpone, sea salt and local honey) and it's one of the most delicious apps or antipastas I've ever had, their meatballs are some of the best in town and don't get me started on the steak bruschetta. They also have Fernet on tap, which is the best after such delicious food. I'm here twice a month on average, and would be there more if there weren't so many other delicious food options on Scottsdale.",

When I made the reservation, I put that it was for a bachelorette party and my sister wore a white dress and sash. We were clearly there to celebrate her getting married, but instead of being polite and congratulating her, he rolled his eyes, scoffed, and gave short answers with a snarky tone to her and our group several times when we asked questions about the menu and ordered food. After we finished eating, we were waiting for probably 15 minutes until he finally brought our bill, and waited another 10 minutes for him to come back for it until we finally had to flag down another server to take our bill to him because he was too busy standing around doing nothing near the kitchen. His disrespectful demeanor was extremely noticeable. This was some of the worst service I've encountered. We were all blown away.   Edit: Let me clarify, besides that one server, I want to point out that the food was very good, the restaurant had a nice layout and design, and the other employees were friendly. After reading our initial review, the owner was kind enough to reach out and offer to rectify the experience for my sister. If she lived in Arizona, she would take him up on it.",

The second thing that strikes you as the friendliness of the staff how they greet you and how well they remember some of your preferences and make suggestions. I really think the food is outstanding as it honors Italian tradition but is still innovative and uses dishes and Inspirations from all the different parts of Italy!",

The mussels were large and perfectly cooked. We then went on to the lasagna and lobster carbonara. The lasagna was so cheesy I couldn't get enough! The presentation of the lobster carbonara was super creative and the gnocchi themselves were super soft. I couldn't stop eating!! Dessert was the brown butter cake - the perfect finish to a fantastic meal!! I'll definitely be back to try more of this amazing menu!! Thanks to Chloe for the prompt and knowledgeable service!! Kudos to the whole team!",

Delicious sauce and great overall. It was fun trying to eat the pizza with the melted cheese with one hand and painting with the other.

Our server was good, not great but the food was awesome. The Focaccia Rustica is a MUST! The meatballs were delicious as well. Others had pizza which they finished so it must have been good! My friend had the tenderloin ordered medium rare and it was definitely more rare but hey, that happens! The mules came out in regular glass and not a copper mug which bothers me (because it just doesn't taste the same!) but not others so no biggie.

    "text": "I give this place a solid 3 stars. And here's why...  We had purchased Paint Nite Groupons and it just so happened that the picture we chose was at Evo. We arrived around 1:30 pm (painting started at 2 pm) and grabbed a few seats at the bar. While the ambiance was nice the female bartender was not. She brought two of the ladies in my party their drinks and when asking what I wanted, she walked off while I commenced to responding. No bueno.  Because it was Restaurant Week, many of the items on the HH menu were not available. Suggestion: If you're participating in a special promotion perhaps you should not offer guests the regular HH menu. Creating a menu for the promotion may better suit both the customer and the venue. No one wants to be disappointed when they ask for something and get shot down with, \"thats not on the menu this week\" or \"neither is that, it's Restaurant Week\".  The female bartender was extremely slow...this was waaaay before the Paint Nite guests started to arrive. Them showing up made her slower. Tony, the male server, tended to the PN crowd. He too was slow. But, in his defense, he appeared to be the only one serving 20+ ppl. Said female bartender was still slow and appeared to be of no assistance.  We ordered a pizza at 3:10 pm. By the time PN was over at 4, the pizza still hadn't arrived. The intention was to eat, drink and paint. We ended up canceling the order.   With two functions occurring simultaneously (PN and Restaurant Week) there should've been adequate staff to accommodate the crowd. Upon walking into Evo I really wanted to like this place and try it another time. But, with how things turned out today. I doubt it.",

EVO is interesting, kind of Euro-Italian trendy joint.  They say they are Italian but I don't think so and the menu is very limited.   Very dark with really bad music.  No idea what was playing or what's going on with that.......    Anyway, I went with two European guys who had Spagetti and Acquerello Risotto.   They both bitched like hell, said it was terrible and did not finish their plates.  As for me, mine was to die for.........I had the Hanger Scallops (I think that was the name).  Four or five big ass scallops sauteed over garlic mashed potatoes.  The best part is that I switched out the cabbage for asparagus.  The broccoli and asparagus were like the Charred Broccoli on the app menu.  It was out of this world, I was very impressed.  Also, we were out on the patio, which had a nice vibe.....  I scoped out the bar - which was full and alive with energy.  A few people were eating what looked like very good pizza.  Edit - The management has contacted me via email and made some comments.  He had genuine concern.  The above Euro guys are hard to please.  Just to be clear, this place was excellent from my point of view.  Thank you EVO for supporting the Yelp community.",

We came in on a Saturday night during happy hour (which the server/bartender said was their strength) and sat at a high top near the bar. We had two different servers/bartenders taking our order and several different food runners bringing our food. The servers were helpful and had great recommendations for drinks and food. But then forgot to put in part of our order. We received all of our food but one dish and had already finished eating when we asked about the missing dish. He ended up not charging us for it and brought it out late, but I always get a little bit (justifiably?) upset when a server takes my order without writing anything down and then makes an error or doesn't place my order.   If I give it another try and find service to be improved, I'll be sure to update my review.",

    "text": "EVO is a fun and hip dinner option on Goldwater, near Old Town Scottsdale.   We arrived after our movie around 5:30 on a Saturday night. Things were mellow when we arrived, with only a few patrons in the bar area. That changed very quickly though. We had a booth situated between two  HDTVs of the losing Nebraska game and the start of the Cubs game at Dodgers Stadium. Nice!  We were immediately greeted by Tayler, our server with two glasses of water. She was our companion throughout the evening and very friendly. Doubly nice!  After perusing the menu, we decided to play it by ear and just order some appetizers to start. We chose the Bruschetta and the Truffle French Fries off the Happy Hour menu, only $5 and $4 respectively. HH runs until 7 pm at EVO, even on Saturday's.  After sitting back for about half hour, we ordered dinner. I chose the Bolognese Pasta; while my better half went the the Santa Margherita (photos) pizza. I added a meatball and some fennel sausage, which complemented the Bolognese nicely.   Over the years, various restauranteurs have tried to talk me out of my preference of thin pasta.  I guess I've finally learned. Bolognese is meant to coat a thicker/ wider pasta to bring out it's favor; whereas my favorite Angel Hair, gets overwhelmed and all you taste is the sauce, or gravy if you will.   Okay I give up, thicker pasta like Tagliatelle or Pappardelle is better for the Bolognese. If you have your doubts, think left over pot roast with spaghetti instead of egg noodles. I rest my case.   Our entrees were very good, tasty with a slight salty flavor, which we didn't mind. For dessert we shared the Flourless Chocolate Torte ($8.00) and some Gelato ($7.00). The Torte (photo) came with small dollops of Goats Cheese, which was a brilliant idea and really, really worked.   Now because we were here for HH everything was marked down. We also had a twenty percent off coupon which was nice. There was also a Yelp tie-in for $0.01 for a Limoncello Cordial, which will be saved for next time.   Yes, there will be a next time because we really liked EVO and enjoyed ourselves.   The tab ran us $80.00 exactly, or $64.77 after discounts, but before gratuities.  Tayler was the best, so we didn't forget her. Ask to sit in her section, you won't be disappointed by her attentive service. Promise.   Enjoy!",

Was in town for work and then stayed the weekend and my BFF flew in for her Bday so we could celebrate.   The place looks nice. Dim lighting, comfy booth seating in the bar. 80's music was playing - perfect for me and my friend. They have a check in offer for a free, or I should say for a penny, lemoncello drink, so my friend and I each ordered one of those. They arrived and I could tell right away that it was not lemoncello but by the strong smell, it was Fireball. LOL. The server said they were out of the lemoncello but figured we'd like this. Alrighty then. I actually don't care for Fireball, but what the heck, down it went. I then ordered a hard cider and we ordered a pizza or flatbread to share. It was very good. You could tell it was done in a wood fired pizza oven. Some parts nice and charred and crispy. Great flavors.  The crowd was cool. It wasn't packed, and most people were in their 40's. Perfect for me. We did have some fun entertainment, a few guys being friendly with us, chatting. You could tell they had quite a bit to drink but were not rude or anything. The server was good and not over serving them and cut them off, which of course, they didn't like and soon left. But it was still great entertainment. Would definitely come back, hopefully for dinner.",

    "text": "It's a shame the food is so good here but our service was horrendous. Went on a Thursday night around 10pm. Place was relatively dead with a few customers. Decided to go to the bar for quicker service. Bartender started off good, answering questions about the menu and giving suggestions. The menu has a great mixture and traditional dishes and the not so common. Decided to go with the grilled octopus for the appetizer and squid ink chatarra for the entree. Grilled octopus took about 20 minutes to come out, surprising given the lack of traffic in the restaurant and bar. It was good! The octopus had a beautiful char and the chopped chorizo complimented it beautifully. Waited at least another 30 minutes for the entree. Once again extremely surprising since the restaurant was practically empty so the kitchen must not have been slammed. I don't mind waiting if the dish takes a while to make, (not sure if this was the case here) but that's something that should be stated. Meanwhile the bartender has not checked in on us, at all during this extensive wait. The dish itself was beautiful and delightful. The pasta and the shrimp were cooked perfectly. The dish had a sauce that was just the right amount of kick and spice. When I ask the bartender for the check, I asked it to be split. He goes to get the check but forgets to split it. I ask him to split it again, and does it correctly this time. We instantly go to put our credit cards down and wait another 5 minutes for him to finish his conversation with another customer, who was not his customer by the way. I'm thinking he's about to come get the check.... nope... he starts to leave the bar area. I have to ask him to charge the cards, before he leaves. Like I said the food was outstanding but the service and wait was horrendous.",

Hubby and I had the ribeye and we both liked it very much. Mine was super rare, exactly as I ordered (rare/blue). Just be careful if you have food allergies, one of the members in our party asked in advance and he still got a salad with the ingredient he was trying to avoid. They immediately corrected it, luckily he saw it prior to tasting the food. I do not go to this area much as I do not like to struggle with parking, but they do have a decent size parking lot.   We had a reservation and hubby and I were seated right away (before the rest of our party arrived), I always appreciate that. Overall good experience.",

We arrived got a sweet rose from a cute flowershop in town &  free drinks and were seated with some of my other yelp elite friends. We were told that Yelp/ EVO would comp all of our meals/drinks as long as it was under $50 per person. I could not believe how generous Yelp/EVO was to us.  She had a few glasses of pinot grigio and I had a few Four Peaks Peach Ale drafts. For an appetizer we shared the EVO salad and the Scallops dish. I wish they gave more than 3 scallops but everything was DELICIOUS! The EVO salad was a \"warm\" salad. It contained brussel sprouts, crunchy kale, feta, pine nuts, and balsamic vinaigrette. It was tasty but I would recommend some dried cranberries for flavor. Our friends ordered the meatballs and they looked yummy.  For our meals we had the Lobster Risotto and my sister had the Chili shrimp pasta dish. Both were filling & fantastic! A major highlight of the night was the medium/palm reader that was there! She really was on point besides one little thing - saying I would be getting married in 2014(even though as of now I am single... so I don't know if that will pan out but hey ya never know right?! ). The EVO staff was wonderful and great! They went above and beyond to make this a memorable experience. Our Community manager Lindsey does an amazing job planning these awesome events. I felt so spoiled at this one and really appreciate EVO and Yelp's kindness.",

When I called to make the reservation the woman on the phone actually asked me if my party could be done eating by 8 because they had another party. Still went, based on reviews and the menu we were pumped to try some place new. When we arrived we learned it was a select menu that only had 3 options for each section and they were not necessarily the best options, nothing to do with Italian food except one pasta dish. My pasta along with others rice pilaf was in need of seasoning and my pasta has lobster in it that you had a hard time tasting. Those in my party that had the lamb chop said it was great but very very rare. Atmosphere is nice and intimate. It was a shame, if they had their whole menu available we might have found a reason to come back, but everyone in my party agreed next time this place is a pass.",

I ordered a BB&T and specifically asked if the blueberries were muddled in the drink, the server said yes. If they weren't going to be muddled then obviously that was a request of mine. The drink was $10 and I expected a $10 drink, the blueberries weren't muddled. Yes I am somewhat of a specialty drink snob but that is why I asked before ordering.  we also shared the bruschetta, not impressed.  Then for my entree I ordered the chile shrimp which was really good and the spicy was just right.  All in all,  I would not return simply for the fact that these Scottsdale places do not measure up to their wanna be status. I have worked in the restaurant business and there is such a lack of customer service these days.  Here's a tip Evo, educate your servers that if you come to refill water for one person at the table, common sense says to glance at all waters and refill as needed, I.E. Less than halfway filled means to refill all waters, then again it's always everyone's first day on the job these days.",

The owner spoke with our table for a while when we arrived and stopped by the table a couple more times during our dinner, and our server was very attentive.  We were there during happy hour, and they definitely have a good one.  Drinks were cheap, and they have a good selection of happy hour menu items, and happy hour is from 4-7 7 days a week!   I ordered off the regular menu and had the pasta bolognese, and it was fantastic!  I am never one to pass up homemade pasta, and this did not disappoint.  Plus, it was very reasonably priced for a decent sized portion.  I also tasted a friend's arancini (fried risotto balls) and my boyfriend's mushroom risotto, both of which were excellent.  The only reason that I am not giving 5 stars-- I wish I could give 4 and a half-- was the noise level.  I was with a group of 6, and we were sitting at a round table, but I had trouble hearing even the person sitting next to me once the place got busy.  That will definitely not keep me from going back though!  Overall, I had a great experience there and am happy to welcome EVO to my neighborhood.",

Nick, EVO's owner, and his crew of servers couldn't have been more lovely and welcoming to the group.  We were set up by our group's leader for a wine tasting of EVO's wine on tap plus appetizers.  We learned a lot about wine on tap thanks to Nick---it's really *better* in a lot of ways than bottled!  And although I am a red wine drinker, I had a lovely little Coppola Pinot Grigio that I think might become my \"before sundown\" beverage of choice!  We also had some wonderful appys---two different bruchettas---a tasty tomato-basil and then this to-die-for one with rare slices of beef tenderloin and slices of asparagus---so good!  The bruchettas were followed by pizzas---Funghi and a Gorgonzola \"white\" pizza.  The mushrooms on the Funghi were roasted and the flavors just burst in your mouth.  The chef had added a touch of honey to the Gorgonzola pizza, that really took it to another level.  Now, I don't really like pizza---it's the crust and red sauce, mostly, so I tend to fork off the toppings to enjoy.  But DH, he is formerly from NJ and is the self-proclaimed pizza expert, said the hearth baked pizza crusts were light and crispy and perfect.  The expert speaks!  And the ambiance of the whole place was so nice and relaxing and fun and the staff was so great---we can't wait to go back.  DH wants to try some of their other pizzas or the Bistecca, while I am torn by the Scallop dish or I so love a well-done risotto as well...  Well, that's obviously at least two more visits!  It's probably just as well EVO is almost 30 minutes from our house or we'd probably park ourselves on their doorstep several nights a week!  Thanks, everyone at EVO, for a great evening!",

Looking from side to side, all I felt in the deepest corner of my soul was pure love and joy from the \"Family\" at EVO.  They made the experience the best I have had in my life, possibly ruining other restaurants altogether. From City Hall to Taco Bell, I have found home in the cozy, dark, candle lit realm that overlooks Camelback mountain. I came in on a Sunday night, where the champagne and wine flowed like rivers due to the half priced bottles. My two bartenders, Jake and Dom, may have been riding steeds, I couldn't tell the difference with how smooth they operated. I ordered the braised beef pasta and the egg yolk drizzled from the cracked head across my dish with vibrance and purpose. While I nestled little bites, I found my own spirit animals, in the form of people all while remixed disco filled the air. The staff danced, sang and were so very interactive.  I laughed, I cried, I lived.  Thank you to Dom and Jake, and the rest of the EVO crew for changing the way i view Restaurants forever!",

    "text": "We had a great experience trying EVO. The food was delicious and quite different, and we would definitely return for if. The pizza and pastas were great but the EVO salad stole the show. We were pretty disappointed with the service though. Our waitress wasn't clear about what was on the menu for vegetarians and wasn't too responsive to any of our questions. She did have a few good suggestions when we were struggling to decide what to order. Her suggestions on proportioning though were very off so I am glad we didn't go with those. The food came out very slowly which was fine for our group since we were conversing, but in a smaller group I think could have been frustrating. We ordered a bottle of wine when ordering our food and we didn't receive it until after our food was served so we ready had to drink it quickly and were unable to enjoy it. They also didn't allow us to taste the wine before pouring for everyone.  Overall, great food choices and good atmosphere (but don't go when a live band is playing because you can't even hear yourself think).",

There aren't many spots in old town that I feel truly capture the right mix of food drinks and of course, people (I'm a hard headed Italian and I think they have nailed the food). The staff are fun and entertaining, the music isn't the overplayed garbage you hear at every club and the late night industry put a really fun spin on it. Feels more like a home away from home. I would definitely recommend this place to anyone looking for something old school, new age and up and coming. Maybe this is an EVOlution. :) cheers",

We started with the beef bruschetta and it was to die for. the combination of meat and cheese with the seasoning melted in my mouth and I've been craving it ever since. I also ordered the Artisan bread with the pesto and dollop of goat cheese. I loved it and the bread, I assumed, was fresh baked. It at least tasted like it.  I ordered the special which was the scallops with saffron risotto. It was ok - I wasn't the biggest fan, but I think it was more on my end then anything to do with the food itself. My 7 year old inhaled his pizza and keeps asking to go back. Definitely two thumbs way up. My only complaint is there were too many yummy options on the menu that I had a hard time deciding what to order.",

    "text": "Whether you're looking for a light Italian meal before a night of clubbing, or just want to check out some late-night bite offerings in Old Town Scottsdale, EVO is a recently opened spot worth checking out. I saw a packed house when I went there for some pre-local show grub on a recent Friday night.  The restaurant is just how I like it -- dim lighting with candlelit tables, along with an expansive bar serving up tasty cocktails amid the pretty people crowd. The cocktails (all $10) are strong and infused with fresh ingredients. I loved the Grapefruit Basil, infused with fresh basil.  For dinner, my pal and I sampled so many of the delicious offerings. Let's start with the Risotto Balls ($5). They usually come in a meat sauce, but we got ours vegetarian. It's fried risotto in a tomato sauce -- every bite was scrumptious, and it's a perfect portion to share as an appetizer.  We also shared the Evo Salad ($10), with Brussels sprouts, kale, pear, and pine nuts -- again, we made ours vegetarian and skipped the pancetta. I never in my life would eat Brussels sprouts willingly, but this salad had me dipping my fork in again and again. I loved the crispy texture, and now, at least at EVO, I'm a Brussels sprouts fan.  We dug into the Caprese salad ($10), which, compared to some of my faves around the Valley, stacked up just fine. Again, this is a great light appetizer before hitting the town.  Finally, we noshed on a Margherita pizza ($11), one that almost rivaled what I've had at my favorite Valley pizza place, Cibo. Everything at EVO just tasted super-fresh and handmade, and with impeccable service, the experience was delightful.  One of the coolest things about EVO is that it's open late-night, which has been a hit with the Old Town Scottsdale service industry looking to wind down. The spot's late night menu is served until 1:30 a.m. every night, and Sunday's would also be a fun night to go, since there is live music and half-off bottles of wine all night.",

That being said, I spent  $18 on the bolognese -and it was great- but quite frankly the portion was... small. Pathetic in fact. At $10, it's justified I suppose.  At $18, inexcusable. I had been here before some time ago and got twice the meal in a large bowl. Same dish, same price. Twice the amount of food. I even took some home.  So, come here. Enjoy the wine and pleasant service... just don't get the bolognese. Though more than 2 stars are probably deserved, I feel a little ripped off.",

We usually eat dinner out pretty early (to avoid crowds), and this was no exception.  We came in around 4 to an empty restaurant.  There was an open booth in the bar we wanted, but the hostess did not want to relinquish due to a 5:30 reservation??  We were out before it was ever occupied.  So we agreed to a table in the restaurant, but she had to check, double-check, and triple-check the reservations?? Maybe 2 parties came in before we left.  I didn't get it, but anyway...  We ordered spiced olives at only $3 on happy hour menu.  I didn't detect any spice, but holy moly, it was like they dumped an entire jar in that bowl!  Spice or no spice, I love olives!  We ordered the cheese board from the happy hour menu as well.  Not overly inspiring, but hey, it's cheese and bread.  Can't go wrong there.  Oddly, when our server presented it, he didn't know whether the jam was tomato or bacon??  Shouldn't he know?  It was bacon!  We also split the daily pizza which was a variety of cheeses and delicious, and a pasta dish (the name escapes me), but it was basically hand made pasta in a butter sauce.  So much sauce that I longed for more pasta or bread to soak it up.  Cheese, pasta, and butter.  The three staples in my diet...which explains a lot.  Easy 4 stars!",

Initially introduced to Evo by a friend of mine, I started coming here more and more as I stayed in the Old Town area to escape the Hi-Fi Kitchen douchebaggery.  This place attracts a lot of the service industry crowd at night and is a great place to relax and enjoy a nice glass of Bell's Two-Hearted Ale, which is on tap. Additionally along with other beers on tap, they also have wine, Fernet Branca (yes!) and Fireball on tap. And...maybe they still have bottles of SLO Down's Sexual Chocolate, which is a luscious Syrah blend...  I've never sat at the tables, but I've received excellent service from Jason and Jessy and the rest of the staff seated at the sometimes crowded bar. Nick recognized me from frequent visits, introduced himself to me, and always took time to welcome me on my return visits.  I've met some great locals here, had great drinks (see above Bell's THA and Fernet reference), and had great food. Food-wise, my favorites were the Pasta Bolognese, Scallop di Evo, and the Evo Salad w/ Scallops (see photo). Unfortunately I didn't try any of the other dishes.  As an homage, after working in the Phoenix/Tempe area and traveling back-and-forth for the better part of 2 years and 8 months, this was where I drank away my final night with friends.  As someone who travels close to 100% of the time, it's always awesome to find a \"home\" away from home. And this place certainly fits the bill.",

However, when it arrived we didn't like any of the meats in it. They ranged from salty to irony tasting. The cheeses were a little better, but nothing compared to many other nearby places.

Couldn't be more different)  A bit inattentive throughout but he did come out to explain that our first funghi pizza was burnt, which is why it took 30 mins to arrive.",

We ordered bruschetta, pasta, pizza, salads, and sandwiches and our entire party liked everything we got.  The waitress was very attentive and nice. We also checked in and got two 1cent Fireball shots which was a little awkward with my 50-something parents there but it was still awesome!   One thing to keep in mind is that most of the restaurant is taken up by a bar and it caters to a younger, hipper crowd. The lighting was very dark and my parents and aunt were whipping out their phones to try and read the menu x). Anyway, I'd definitely come back but my parents would probably prefer somewhere with brighter lighting.",

    "text": "In a nutshell: New-age \"inspired\" Italian...that's short on wow (e.g. bland). Good, casual service. The yelp coupon is a shot of fireball? Just doesn't seem to fit the vibe.  Had dinner for two on a Thursday night around 6:30. Evo was easy to find, had plentiful free parking and is in a nice space. Well decorated. Really cute, very pleasant hostess opened the door to greet us with a smile. Good start. Seated at a nice table for two. Evo wasn't crowded so we had plenty of space. Had the tables on either side been occupied, it would have been cozy.  We chose Evo over an older school place thinking the food might be great based on other yelper reviews who seem to focus more on lousy service in their complaints.  To our surprise, the service was fine. Attentive but casual. Above average beer and wine selection.  The menu appears great, though the starters are a not even a bit on the light side. We ordered the crispy risotto,. Good, not great and something of a holdover from the 90s I think. Whatever, it was fine.  Then the entrees: The Sablefish was ordered ($27) and the Broccoli Gnocchi ($14). I tried the  Sablefish first. Let me tell you my shock. This dish was so bad. Just outright bad. It was edible only in the sense that it wasn't off putting. However, it lacked any discernible flavor whatsoever. It wasn't send it back bad but it was certainly I'll never go back bad. The Gnocchi was better only in that it had an overpowering garlic flavor so it tasted like something. However, it was textually terrible (no little lines like you get on hand-rolled gnocchi). Again, not good.  Dessert was an affogato and the Italian donuts. I don't know if they were good or bad because I was so amazed at how bad the entrees were.  In fairness, I should give them another chance because maybe the chef called in sick. Regardless, I was so disappointed in the food I just can't fathom trying Evo again.   I'm not trying to be cruel, I'm trying to be honest. The truth is that this was among the worst meals I've ever had in a restaurant.   I would encourage you to take my review with a grain of salt because others seem to think Evo has some decent food. To me, it was outright terrible. Maybe It's me?  One final note: I just can't conceive of a restaurant that takes itself seriously when it comes to food (of any kind, much less Italian) yet offers a special on shots of fireball. Really? Seems kind of cheesy and immature to me. Why not offer an appetizer at half-off or something?",

The toasted bread was infused with olive oil and made it really tasty. Fettuccini Alfredo was pretty good. The cheese pizza was the best pizza ever! It was soooo good. I will be for sure coming back for the pizza next time. Maybe just to get it to go. But sooo delicious!!!!

Our waitress was having a hard time hearing what we wanted and we were having a hard time hearing her. She was very sweet and did do a good job. The food is an imaginative version of Italian. The popular meatballs are tasty but contain a bit too much bread; I actually got one that had a huge chunk of bread in it. All I can say is they aren't my Italian grandmother's meatballs but they are tasty. We also shared the steak bruschetta which again was tasty but there was more bread than carpaccio.. My husband ordered the rib eye steak which was cooked medium rare as ordered but he felt it was overly marinaded for what could be a good steak without marinade. I ordered the lobster carbonara which was very good, nice size lobster tail and gnocchi that were light and tender. For dessert we ordered the brown butter cake which was the highlight of the evening; it was excellent! We also ordered a bottle of red wine from Sicily that was very nice and reasonably priced and ordered 2 espressos which weren't bad. EVO would not be our go-to place for Italian but the prices are reasonable for what you get.",

Pizzas are very good too. They serve food until very late and I'd say this is the best late night food available anywhere. There is often live music and the ambiance is nice though I usually stay at the bar or on the patio.",

    "text": "EVO creates the perfect ambiance for a first date, family dinner or even guys who want to meet up for a beer and watch some sports.  Popular among the local service industry bartenders and servers in Old Town, EVO provides an elegant yet understated environment where all feel welcome.   The food covers a wide array of light Italian fare, including house made meatballs, funghi pizza, and bolognese.  What is great about EVO is that it meets the needs of all; they offer a Happy Hour Menu from 4-7pm and a Late Night Menu after dinner until 1:30am nightly.  The owner, Nick Neuman, is a stand-up guy who treats customers and employees alike with respect, sincerity, and warmth.  He understands quality food while creating a setting that steers away from what some might call the snooty Scottsdale vibe.  I strongly recommend this restaurant, whether it be for a casual drink at the bar with friends or to celebrate a special occasion.  Come to EVO and you'll feel at home.",

We sat at the bar first and had a couple of cocktails, a Ketel One up and a drink on their menu called the Sunset.  Both were well made and tasty.  We had the Funghi pizza and Heirloom tomato pasta as entrees, the brussel sprout and kale salad, the grilled bread and olive oil, and a couple wines by the glass.  Everything was well above average, seasoned well, and exactly what you want when dining out. Typically, pasta dishes can do you in because they are so heavy so I usually take some home.  In this case, I finished the whole dish because it was that good.  They have their own parking lot so the parking was a breeze.  Can't wait to go back,",

I looked on Yelp and saw that EVO had a lot of good reviews, so I looked over their menu and it looked like exactly what I was looking for. EVO provided some of the best service I have ever seen at a restaurant. Our waiter Tony was awesome and super attentive. We loved his facial expressions with every course that we ordered solidifying that we were ordering well. For cocktails, I had the peaches dream and it was quite refreshing and tasty. My friend had the Monroe's Mule and enjoyed hers as well. To start we shared the Focaccia Rustico which was amazing and you won't find anywhere else. If you are a fan of brie, marscapone, and honey then this is a must. I had the mushroom risotto and my friend had the lobster risotto for our main courses. Both were unique and delicious in their own ways. To end on a high note, we had the Nutella cannolis which were just enough and the perfect ending to this perfect meal and experience. To say that I highly recommend this restaurant is not enough. It is definitely a MUST to visit as you won't be disappointed and you don't want to miss out.",

We started with the burrata to share. I had the squid ink chittara, which was excellent--and I'm from Seattle originally so I'm a stickler about good seafood. My son had the lobster alfredo. It was also very good, although different than what we thought...it was basically a lobster tail in the shell with a side of gnocchi--it wasn't mixed together. Girlfriend has specific tastes, so we special ordered gnocchi in alfredo sauce which wasn't on the menu. They very happily accommodated our request and she enjoyed her meal. The service was excellent, with our server being supported by additional staff, cleaning up plates and refilling water. One thing to note, it is quite loud in there...I wouldn't bring my hard-of-hearing dad there, but for us it made for a fun and lively atmosphere. We will definitely be back.",

I had three and each had a portion that was gristly that I physically had to remove from my mouth.   2. Whiskey cocktail - instead of the typical single ice cube, the entire glass was filled with ice cubes (like the ones you get at a vending machine). To make matters worse, there was so much ice it was above the rim of the glass.   3. Pork chop - good portion if you enjoy eating fat; ~40-50% was fat. The bean mix on the bottom of the dish was extremely salty and the orange puree tasted like an orange push-pop.  4. Roasted potatoes (side dish)- The potatoes were dry and flavorless like they were previously made and put under a heat-lamp.  5. Brussel sprouts (side dish)- the brussel sprouts were separated into leaves, fried and had a mayo drizzle on top. The net weight of the dish was approx. 1g because the leaves had been separated to make it appear as if there was more food. I imagine about 3 brussel sprouts went into the making of the dish. On top of this, the sodium content was through the roof.",

This spot is beautiful and the staff was off the chain.  Jason took care of us at the bar and knew the perfect balance between recommending worthy food/drinks and  giving us space to enjoy and take it all in.  The cocktails alone would make me come back-- but when our food came it just kept getting better.    I love when restaurants have the \"it factor\" and this spot has just that.  The live music on Sunday night is exactly what people need to to wind down to over a beer before their work week starts again.  Atmosphere is simple, classy, sexy and relaxing.  Definitely a hidden gem.",

Ambiance was lovely and romantic, and they had a fun crowd at the bar if that's what you are seeking. The patio looks killer also, can't wait for it to cool off and enjoy a lovely meal al fresco.  To start- we had the Bruschetta- which was out of this world...it was Grilled Bread | Beef Tenderloin | Asparagus | Taleggio | Truffle Oil...just heavenly. For an app we also shared the Meatballs which has such delicious Italian flavors. Next we had the Chile Shrimp pasta...Tagliatelle pasta | Shrimp | Chile | White Wine | Mint | EVOO...divine! Perfect for summertime, nice & light. Paired with their fresh cocktails, the meal hit it out of the park. Bartenders are all just awesome, service was great and the owner was a delight and made sure we were having an amazing experience- which we did. If you have not been to EVO, you are missing out!",

The food is pretty good- but very expensive. I had the pesto pizza which was pretty good and another time I had the Alfredo. Both pretty good although I would go with the Alfredo. Unfortunately the pizza is $14 and the pasta is $15 and I always like to add some sort of protein to my pastas but I felt uncomfortable paying over $20 for a pasta that was a smaller portion size than I expected. It might have been the plate it was served in, which is pretty cool looking and a bit different, but I felt like I could have had 2 of them and still been hungry.  Overall I still approve! Maybe I'll come back for the $26 salmon although I'm a bit afraid on the size..",

The food was 3 stars, so I am going to give it the 3 and pretend the service didn't happen. The pesto for the bread was extremely delicious, but the rest of the meal was just okay.   I would NOT go with a larger group.  We had two tables of about 12 people each.  We ordered several bottles of champagne, the server poured extremely uneven glasses around the table (I had less than an inch of champagne while my neighbor's glass literally over flowed), then the other bottles were placed in ice buckets behind a service station, our glasses were empty most of the night, people kept asking to have our bottles brought out, after 45 minutes of asking our server, we got a back waiter to finally bring it out to us.  The gals that weren't drinking champagne waited at least 30 minutes from ordering to receiving glasses of wine. Our side dishes were brought out as if they were appetizers with one gal receiving her entree at that time. The rest of our food arrived about 45 minutes later but one person had to wait another 25 for her food.  Overall it was a mess, and dinner took more than 3 hours.",

I had the lobster gnocchi which was presented in the lobster tail itself, which was nice to touch. It was a bit on the saltier side, but the lobster was good. Other people enjoyed their food as well and there were plenty of options for the vegetarians.

    "text": "We loved dining at Evo.   I came here with a big group from work for a team dinner. We always order lots of appetizers to share, which I love because it allows us to try multiple things on the menu. We ordered the arancini, bruschetta, and a pasta appetizer that was like one huge ravioli.   The ravioli was everyone's favorite - beautiful handmade pasta stuffed with a creamy filling in a decadent sauce. The arancini was a close second - a ball of cheesy risotto fried to a crisp on the outside, served in a puddle of hearty marinara sauce. Drool.   For my entree, I chose the Squid Ink Chitarra - handmade black pasta accompanied by shrimp, mussels, calamari, scallions, saffron, butter, and calabrian chile. I paired it with a glass of white wine and it was unreal. I loved it. It transported me straight back to Italy, a fond memory of enjoying squid ink pasta in homemade marinara with a glass of white wine overlooking the Mediterranean. Yum-o!  For dessert, we got the butter cake. All I can say, is you HAVE TO order it if you come here for dinner. It's unreal. So buttery. So flavorful. I actually had a dream about it that night... it's that good.  Evo supposedly also has a great happy hour, and I'm excited to go back and try even more dishes and wines from their menu. I'd love to try the grilled octopus. I also appreciate that the location is central in Old Town, too.",

My bolognese was pretty darn good. I added a meatball, which is good too. I topped my pasta with Parmesan which added to the flavor.   My friend liked his dish too, but  another friend not too much. We ended returning it.   We don't usually return plates either but if we're paying a lot for food, we want to be satisfied.  Aside from my friends plate, I would stick to the safe bets, like spaghetti or Alfredo or even the bolognese . I would come back just for the food though. Wouldn't expect much from the service aspect.",

From the service, to the food, to the venue ambience, top to bottom-- everything associated with this location is high quality.  The squid ink pasta is a difficult dish to execute, but the chef cooked everything to perfection. The spices were present but not overwhelming and balanced the rich, buttery flavor of the squid ink. Every piece of seafood on the plate was reminiscent of a trip to the coast.  I have far too many positive things to say about this experience to detail in a Yelp comment. Anyone who enjoys food should definitely give this place a try.",

The atmosphere was cozy and romantic, our server was attentive and friendly, and the food was outstanding.  For the appetizer we chose the Caesar salad and the grilled octopus. My boyfriend gets the Caesar salad everywhere we go and he loved EVO's version. The grilled octopus was perfect and not overly chewy, with a great char and flavor.  For the entree we ordered the steak and lobster risotto. Wow! These were both winners! The steak was tender and flavorful while the lobster risotto was perfection, bursting with flavor and had lots of lobster chunks throughout.  For dessert we got each of the options, the panne cotta and the chocolate cake. They balanced each other perfectly, with the chocolate cake rich and decadent and the panne cotta citrusy and light.    This really is a perfect date night location and we will be back soon!",

I started off the night with a Grapefruit Basil cocktail. I am not usually a grapefruit fan but this drink was refreshingly amazing. It is the perfect summer concoction!   We ordered the meatballs for the table and split them in half. They were so delicious that I wish I would have ordered them as my entree.   For my main course I chose the heirloom tomato spaghetti. It wasn't the best I ever had and the handmade pasta felt over cooked but it was still tasty and enjoyable.   For desert we ordered the Brown Butter Cake (you have to place this order 20 min in advance!). It was CRAZY good. I wanted to order another to take home. It's not overbearingly rich and the creamy and spongey texture were perfection.",

From the outside it looks like a normal bar but the inside ambience is fun and gorgeous. They play really good music, too! I was hearing new songs and early 2000 songs and the mashup was great. My fiance and I ordered drinks, I got the strawberry limoncello (made with gin) and my fiance got a drink with Jameson. Gin has a very strong taste and I was impressed with how the cocktail masked the flavor just the right amount. The drinks were delicious, we ordered another round! Great bartender. We ordered our food at the bar just to munch on something while conversing. I chose the Burrata Salad. It comes with bread, balsamic glaze, burrata cheese, a tomato relish type of spread, pesto and arugula. It was absolutely amazing!!! I loved it but I truly do love those flavors combined. My fiance was enjoying it too.   My fiance decided to order the meatballs. I have heard the meatballs at EVOO are incredible, so I will say we were a bit disappointed. I'm not sure if their meatballs are always so mushy inside, but ours were VERY mushy. Like mushier than meatloaf, I kid you not. We tried to force ourselves to eat it but it wasn't happening lol. I hope it was just an anomaly and maybe next time we try them they're good!   Overall I definitely enjoyed this place. We plan on coming back and trying the EVOO salad and some pasta! Can't wait.",

I recently stopped in again (and again) for HH and now REALLY like it!  Both times I had the mushroom (and truffle) pizza and it's delicious! It's pretty big, and honestly if you order this at the bar with a couple beers or glasses of wine you're good to go. I've also had the bruschetta board and all the types I sampled were yummy! The pear and brie one was my favorite. I've also tried the arancini, which are basically big, fried risotto balls. They're a little heavy, but good. Last time I came I had the ciabatta w/pesto dip & goat cheese. The dip was very good!   Beer & wine wise EVO has pretty much the best HH deals in Old Town. $3 pints of quality beers (there's three to choose from) & $5 glasses of wine.   Service is friendly.   I'll continue to keep EVO in my Happy Hour rotation.",

Besides the BB Cake, we also had the flourless chocolate dessert complimented with an espresso martini and all were amazing. Start to finish, 5 stars.

In addition to the HH menu they also had an evening brunch menu as well. I ordered a raspberry Moscow mule along with biscuits and gravy off the brunch menu. The drink was delicious, a great balance of tart raspberry vodka and ginger beer. The biscuits and gravy were great as well. 2 large biscuits topped with gravy and onions with a side of potatoes. I could have done without the onions and I wish they had a bit more gravy.  I can't wait to come back and try something off their standard menu because their pizza and pasta looked delicious!",

The pasta had been cooked then left partially out of water so some was actually crisp. One of the mussels was rubber. The other barely cooked.   Service was good, however.",

    "text": "We came here for Arizona Restaurant Week. Upon entering the restaurant, we were greeted by the hostess. There was still one person in our party yet to arrive, so we asked to sit in the couches that were somewhat of a waiting area. I went to the restroom and when I came back, my husband informed me that the hostess said the seating area was reserved. We thought that was odd, so we just asked to be seated at our table and we would wait for our friend to arrive. The table that we sat at had a very dusty table cloth and while they did bring a lint roller out to clean it, I felt there was a bit of an attitude that we asked for the table cloth to be cleaned off. The appetizers were decent but our entrees came out under cooked. We ordered our steaks \"medium rare plus\" and they came out rare. After waiting 10 minutes for a server to come by (not our server), we made mention that the steaks were underdone. They took them and brought them back about 10 minutes later properly prepared. Last item to note was that we had asked for our desert \"to go\" as we had to get back to relieve our babysitter (the under cooked steaks resulted in us being at the restaurant about 35 minutes longer than we needed to be) and they brought the desert out on a plate. Rather than wait for them to take it back and box it, we just ate it there even though we were pretty full. Our friends Cacio e Pepe was overly peppered to the point of it being inedible. She did not mention anything to the server as she was already full. I probably would not recommend this restaurant nor do I see myself returning.",

    "text": "This is going to be short as it's a late review from my original visit. This place has amazing handmade pasta and this cheese bread for an appetizer. EVO falls under a 3 star rating based on a steak I ordered. Steak in my opinion should be the easiest thing to do on a menu for any restaurant of this caliber. Especially when they have perfected many other dishes on their menu. I ordered a rare steak with instruction to just sear each side and serve. The steak arrived and it was close to well done which may happened because the steak was thin. Which for the price you would expect a thicker size of maybe 1 inch at least which is more forgiving in over cooking. I sent my steak back as it was inedible for me. The second was more medium, but as everyone was almost done finishing their dinner, I kept it. This is what ruined the experience. My recommendation is stay away from the steak. The other items are great.",

    "text": "When Davanti Enoteca suddenly closed a couple years ago, I was very disappointed. A couple months ago, word spread that the former chef would be returning to Phoenix to take over EVO. I made it out to EVO the first chance I got, and the feeling of disappointment returned.  While Davanti was a classy space, EVO tries very hard to cater to the typical Scottsdale club set. C'mon, 1 cent Fireball shots?! Not surprisingly, the cocktails were lackluster.    I went to EVO hoping that the foccaccia di recco, a famous dish from Davanti, would be available, but apparently, only people who know the chef are privy to that. I know this for a fact because I saw someone had posted about receiving the dish on another website the exact same night we were there. The evening's disappointments continued. My husband's pork belly was overcooked and the roasted cauliflower wasn't any better than what I can do at home, but the controne poppers were very good. Spicy, deep fried pizza dough is a winner in my book. Sadly, I think this was the highlight of the meal. My husband didn't like his underseasoned steak. My linguine was boring and didn't remind me at all of the cacio e pepe dishes I've had in Italy that it modeled after. My sister and friend said the squid ink chitarra was pretty good, but they didn't like it enough to finish the dish.  We sat out on the patio to enjoy the nice weather, but we also felt overlooked by the waitstaff. I still hear people raving about their great experiences at EVO, but we didn't enjoy our visit nearly as much.",

The food is tasty and I appreciate the vegetarian options. Most of the time, the service is good. The one time exception that I have not been able to push from my memory was for a friend's birthday party. We were a party of 14 and from the beginning, the night was a mess. It took 20 minutes for our server to greet us and take our drink orders (without much of an apology.) I ordered the vegetable risotto which came out 30 minutes after everyone had received their food. I essentially ate by myself and when the house manager came over to make amends, he gave two other people refills on their drinks. It was very strange and while I have not experienced anything like that since, it bumped EVO down on my list.",

The ambiance is very laid back, but warm with the fun sound of an acoustic guitarist playing the background. Tony, our awesome waiter, was quick to greet us and go over the menu with us since it was mine and the hubby's first trip here. We settled on drinks (I got a glass of Sexual Chocolate ($14) a deliciously fine blend of Zin and Syrah) and started with the Scallop Di EVO ($14), which was cooked to perfection, at least in my unprofessional opinion. The three large scallops came in a scrumptious butter sage sauce garnished with chopped up granny smith apples that just tickled my taste buds. The appetizer was devoured quickly, but we didn't have to wait long for our entrees.  I ordered the Lobster Risotto ($22) which didn't include much Lobster and the risotto needed a little help, but I know cooking Risotto can be a challenge. The hubster ordered the Roasted Chicken ($19) and enjoyed his (so did I), but we made sure to leave room for dessert. I debated between the Chocolate Torte ($6) and the Zeppolini ($6) for about five minutes and finally committed to the Zeppolini (they are small italian doughnuts) which came in a tart raspberry sauce to counter the sugary goodness of the Zeppolini (but I think I would have preferred it without the sauce or at least have it on the side).  It was a great night and we will be back. We want to try the pizza and if the other servers are anything like Tony, we will be coming back just for that aspect.",

I ordered pappardelle and the server had to wait long 30 mins to let me know that they are out of noodle. So they replaced with another and food was just unbearable salty. Not only mine, my co worker's.  That is alright. I can bare that. Next is the service. Had to wait good 20-30 mins for the check. Servers were running around and would not check up on the table at all. Even for water. Had to call a random sever and point out the server to get the bill.  We were disappointed in the whole service and that is what the gratuity is for.  \"Customer\" pays the gratuity for value of service. I tip generously. Specially when the company is paying for it. But we decided not to tip due to the poor care.   Guess what, either the server or the management (whoever has access to it) changed the tip from 0 to $10. Saw that after reading my statement and checking the receipt. This is forgery!!",

This restaurant has a combination of excellent food, extremely friendly staff, great wine/cocktail/beer selection, and a really nice fun vibe and ambiance.    In terms of specifics my favorite appetizer was the Polpettina which is delicious meatballs served with garlic bread and tomato sauce.  They definitely don't skimp on the meatballs, and the meat was tender, perfectly cooked, and the tomato sauce and garlic bread were delicious.  The Bruschetta was also really good and it's topped with Beef Tenderloin and asparagus, and again the meat was both cooked very well and it was a very generous amount of beef.  The pizza here is also quite good.  I tried two over the past few days, the Pepperoni and the Funghi.  I love pepperoni pizza in general and this one was just done very well and it's the perfect size for either a smaller meal, or to split.  The Funghi pizza was really tasty and in a little added twist the hostess suggested adding some goat cheese to it along with the mozzeralla and that was a great addition.  The only entree I tried was the Bistecca which was a very good New York Strip with gorgonzola cheese .  The meat came out exactly as I ordered and the brussel sprouts were really good (and I'm a bit of a brussel sprout snob).  I spent most of my time at the bar and enjoyed the wines on tap, along with a very unique and creative cocktail menu.  My favorite cocktail was the El Sugararo which is both delicious and has a nice spicy bite to it.  Everyone that I saw try it really liked it.  The bartenders are all extremely friendly and fun and make you feel at home.    Overall a great experience and a very well run new restaurant!",

We sat at the bar for drinks and snacks and could not have been more content with the experience.  The happy hour menu is slightly short on the edible choices for a vegetarian, but they happily made the arancini with marinara instead of meat sauce and were totally cool with splitting a pizza half meat/half veg. Our bartender was so sweet and accommodating, we even got 2 rounds of pretty addicting ciabatta and olive oil as we wrapped up our second glass of beverages. I love that the red wine is served lightly chilled, just the way I like it!  Though in a rather inconspicuous location that has been somewhat of a revolving door for restaurants in the past year or so, I truly hope EVO breaks the streak and stays for good. The low-lighting, speakeasy atmosphere is romantic and laid back at the same time. The crowd is energizing without being invasive. And being only 2 miles away, I hope to become more of a regular before EVO becomes too trendy in Old Town :)",

    "text": "Saturday night at EVO was busy and loud with amazing people watching.  Interesting name, as no EVO in sight. Beet salad was good, not great. EVO salad (Brussels sprouts, fried kale) very good. Arancia (coated, fried risotto) good.  Pork belly app terrific. Pork belly risotto very tasty, but could have used more meat.  (Same risotto, by the way, as the risotto app, so no need to get both.) spicy shrimp pasta tasty, nice burn.  At 50, we clearly were 20-25 older than virtually every other diner.  Interesting place with interesting but not out standing food.  Good but not excellent service. Reasonable pricing. Too loud to be able to sit at a big table and engage in conversation.",

Its a trendy and slightly upscale place and was perfect for stopping by after a long day at work for some food and drinks. It could also be a good date night spot. We ordered off the HH menu the shrimp brushetta, Funghi Pizza, and Steak Sandwich. They were all very flavorful and well priced. Unfortunately I was driving so I didn't have anything to drink but I will say that all draft and bottled beers were $3 and their Signature Drinks were only $6 and looked amazing!    Once we were seated by our hostess we spent a lot of time waiting around for our waitress. We were seated in the bar area and even though there were very few people in the restaurant everything from our drinks to our food seemed to take way to long (20-30min). Our waitress wasn't at all attentive or at all friendly and would disappear every times we needed something.   Overall, the food and drinks for HH were good and I would return because of that and pray we get better service our next visit:)",

All the cocktails my group had were fabulous.  The grilled brushetta is delicious, but nothing special..more traditional style, but yummy. The pizzas we had were pretty burnt and in general they just were not good.  That is what made it 3 stars for me...usually even bad pizza is kind of good.  I feel like I need to come back and try more things; many of the dishes that went by looked and smelled appetizing.  The service was outstanding, and EVO subscribes to the whole local, fresh ingredient thing which I commend.",

I had the grapefruit basil cocktail and he had a glass of wine. I had the bruschetta and he had the chicken sandwich with fries. The drinks were great and well priced. He loved his sandwich and the fries were delish (truffle) but my bruschetta was super disappointing. Basically slices of toasted bread with a TINY amount of diced tomatoes.  We ordered dessert (mini donuts with dipping sauce) and the literally took 25 minutes to arrive. About 10 minutes in, I saw the waiter look at us with that \"whoops\" look on his face, run to the kitchen, then come back to us to say \"Sorry - the kitchen is really swamped tonight\". Really? Pretty sure you just forgot to put the order in, buddy, which is totally fine. You ain't gotta lie to kick it.  I will be back to try other happy hour food items. Great location as it's in the heart of old town.",

I originally reserved for 24 people at 7:30, a few other people showed up, unexpectedly.      Nick, the owner, was very accommodating to my extra guests.   The whole staff did an amazing job servicing my whole party.   Being in the restaurant industry years ago, I know how complicated it is to cater a large party, on top of that-the restaurant itself was busy.   Food was excellent, wait staff was very courteous, lots of smiles, good times, and decor is cute cute cute.^_^   One of my guest said that she loved her red wine, which came from a keg-chilled.   I was slightly disappointed that they didn't offer braised Rabbit Bolognese, which i had when the restaurant first opened.  So i opt to choose the Bolognese with meatballs, every bite was orgasmic, and hearty.    The sauce was tangy which I love. I also tried their Lobster Risotto.  Risotto was cooked perfectly, the consistency of the texture sauce was spot on.  There was other great feedbacks.    I'm glad to have shared this unique Italia experience in Scottsdale with my friends.",

The server had no issues dealing with our party of 8; he was very attentive and provided helpful suggestions.  I think the restaurant would be a solid 4 stars if the prices were a little more fair, considering the portion sizes of the entrees.  I did not order a salad but had a chance to taste a couple variations, they are very tasty.  We were celebrating a friends birthday so the $0.01 fireball shots for a Yelp Check-In came in very handy for the occasion--of course fireball whiskey shots are never a good idea. Ha ha!  All the surrounding tables appeared to be having a great time, inlcuding ours.  I would like to give this place another try to see if I can be convinced to be satisfied with a 4 star rating.",

Our server wasn't that great, had to ask for drink refills - not very attentive. Had to stop him when he was walking by rather than him checking on us. It was the night before Valentine's Day and they were obviously overwhelmed. My friends ordered the EVO salad - it had crispy brussel sprouts and kale. My friends didn't realize that the kale would be crispy - it was super dried out - it crumbled when you touched it with a fork. I asked if it mentioned that on the menu and a manager overheard me and stopped to ask if everything was ok. My friend started to relay that she knew the brussel sprouts would be crispy but - the manager cut in and said \"that's kale\"....ok, had she let her finish her sentence she would have said that she didn't realize that the kale would be as well. My friends asked to switch their salads for Caesars instead. The manager said \"yeah, it's a love it or hate it salad\" and took them away. Stopped back by the table to let us know she took care of the EVO salads - hard to relay but she was acting like she was doing us a favor. We got the charcute board - always good there. Got the raviolo for the first time and it was delicious. Then dinner. I got the Arrabiata pizza - it was cold and way too spicy. Arrabiata is spicy I get it. But it didn't really taste like anything else - just super hot. My fiance got the Amatriciana - he liked it but I honestly thought it tasted like chicken flavored ramen. Then we ordered dessert - Zeppolinis and butter cake. Almost 30 mins later, no sign of dessert. We were ready to get out of there so we just asked our server to cancel it. The response was pretty much \"oh, ok\" rather than checking on it or apologizing for the wait. He did obviously tell the manager though, who brought us 2 business cards with notes on them for free desserts - but again had an attitude. They were way too busy. We gave our free desserts to the next table and left. Really disappointing, this place was so good before!",

Roasting the kale and Brussels sprouts brings out their flavor and adding goat cheese just rounded it perfectly. I had the pork belly risotto and it wasn't watery or flavorless. It was probably on the salty side but I like salty so it wasn't a problem for me, it was very good. My husband had the pasta Alfredo and enjoyed it as well. For desserts they were out of the tiramisu so we ordered the zeppolini and they were delicious. Our waiter even brought me a little side of Nutella.  They have a parking lot which is a huge plus, not having to go around looking were to park. We'll certainly come back.",

The drinks were tasty but the amount of alcohal you got for the price didnt quite match on some of the cocktails. They are not very good at making modifications to the dinner items and they ran out of some of the stuff on the menu that night which seemed odd. The service was also very slow and sloppy in terms of knowing who ordered what and which drink had what alcohol in it. We had to do taste tests thanks to the waiter not knowing what he even had in his hands.   Overall, I was there with a larger party and the food was good for some and bad for others. The service was average and all over the place. 3 stars sounds about right.",

    "text": "The charcuterie was expansive but with an odd selection that was uncomplimentary to eachother. Do not order the calamari! Rubbery, fishy, lacking in flavor. The heirloom tomato and bolognese pastas were very average but of good portion sizes. The pork belly risotto had very over cooked pork belly unproportionaly small to the amount of risotto. The only above average dish was the langasto pasta which didn't feel worth the price. Clearly, most of the yelp reviews are from drunk Scottsdale club-goers.",

The cocktail menu was phenomenal-- had a hard time deciding, but ordered the tasty Monroe's Mule.  My Michigan-native friend (who lives in PHX) was so excited they had Michigan Bell's Two-Hearted on tap.  Decent wine menu, BUT THE FOOOOOOD.  We started with the Focaccia (brie, mascarpone, honey) appetizer, and it was amazing.  Like roll-your-eyes-when-you-eat-it good.  I'd almost recommend it for dessert with a nice glass of rose.  I ordered the kale and brussel sprout salad, and it was huge.  It could've easily been split with another person, but I ate it up because it was crispy and delicious with the tastiest nuggets of chevre, pancetta, and pear.  Instead of an entree, I ordered the raviolo app, and I about died.  Truffled ricotta, more pancetta, and brown butter sauce-- very reminiscent of a dish I had at Mario Batali's Osteria Mozza in Los Angeles.  My daughters ordered the charred octopus & potato app and the charcuterie board, and they liked both.  The charcuterie board is HUGE-- enough for 4+ people as an app, 2+ for an entree.  I wish I remember our server's name because he was great (Ricardo maybe????)-- want to hug him for recommending the focaccia.  We ate slightly early on a Monday night (6ish?), but I was surprised at how un-busy they were.  Love that most restaurants in PHX area take reservations.  Kind of out of the way (out of sight) from downtown-- have their own parking lot which is great.  Loved the ambiance.  We were in PHX and Sedona for a week from Detroit, and it was definitely our fave meal from beginning to end.  Anyway, yes, I'm gushing because it was THAT GOOD.  I hope they do well because I want to come back!!!!",

Everything was delicious, however I do wish the salmon was a little larger or that it came with a little more something on the side. The first time I ordered the bistecca it came with these delicious brussel sprouts, however about a month later when I ordered the same bistecca I was given brussel sprout flakes (????) which are not filling, kinda strange. However, the rest of the food, atmosphere, wine and staff have always made my visit good. P.S. try their little homemade donut dessert.... So yummy!!",

Warning - the place is loud so dont expect a quiet dinner. It was totally fine for our group but just an FYI.  The food here is truly amazing. Everyone in our group of 8 was impressed with their food. Some of the highlights of our meal were the bolgenese, the beef heart, the pesto bread, the EVO salad, and the Oreccchiette.",

Very skimpy portions for $13.  Other food was decent.  We then noticed a loud table  next to us, which started off with 2 people and a dog, with a bowl of water.   Shortly after, employees took turns to sit at this table,  while taking short breaks(try using a break room).  At one point, a waitress pet the dog several times, then immediately went to serve a table their food, without washing her hands.  Another employee pet same dog and walked to back of building.  Not exactly what I'd call sanitary.  We spent a good deal of money to eat here, yet your employees were careless, dirty, and very unprofessional.  I felt like I was at a fast food restaurant.  I will not be back.  Too many great restaurants in the area and no need to settle.  I hope management corrects these issues for your sake.  To be fair though, our waitress did a good job and pizza was good, which were the reasons for the 2nd star.",

The inside is very chic and intimate and menu very diverse Italian cuisine. They even personified the top of the meanies with the bride-to-be's name.

To start, they have a nice drink menu but most of the table ordered a specialty drink with basil. Waiter comes back and says they are out of basil can we get you something else. How does an Italian Resturant run out of basil??????? After waiting what seemed like an hour the apps finally came out and were awesome as stated above. About another hour went by and finally dinner came out and here came the let down. Some plates were hot, some were cold, some food was hot, and some was not (nice rhyme I know...). The bolognese was cold and tasted like tomato paste and basically no meat. The rest of the food was bland and not exciting: gnocchi, squid ink pasta, and fennel sausage. Again just ok. We then got the free desert which took about 30 minutes to bring and was ok.   All in all, just an ok place and there are much better modern Italian places here in Phoenix/Scottsdale, especially for what you are paying. Not sure how a dinner for a Resturant like this should take almost 3 hours but it did. Also, while the server was nice and friendly check up on your table once in awhile.",

I ordered the bruschetta, surf and turf (pork and scallops), and the chocolate torte. Arancini (fried risotto ball) also came as a small bite included with Restaurant Week. That was a nice touch.  Bruschetta - chorizo and egg were great, but the bread was too hard.  Surf and turf - pork temple and diver scallop. Scallop was cooked nicely but there was way too much salt. Pork and the sides were good.  Chocolate torte - amazing! Should have saved more room for this...  The service was very good. We noticed that they put a lot of effort into the presentation of the food as well. I would come back again!",

The name, combined with the upscale-casual, verging-on-tacky-but-still-posh vibes you sense upon entry should immediately tip you off. This place is Scottsdale as fuhhh, but then, the hip music selection and chic booths ease you into it, and you're like, \"yeah. I can dig this.\"  Fast forward four and a half minutes: you're ordering bruschetta of the day (ours had pea shoots and crab), kale salad (complete with crispy brussels sprouts, pear, goat cheese, and pine nuts), and trendy thin crust pizzas. You're sipping something bubbly. Life is good.   Finish the experience full force and hop in your BMW, head back to NoSco, and watch Orange is the New Black on Tivo. Doze off peacefully on your Tempurpedic, memories of good times at EVO floating through your perfect little head.",

AND....evo must consistently hire these folks because our previous 2 visits, we experienced the same sincere and great food/drink service.   i hate i don't remember his name, but i should stop by and commend him to his manager.   we ordered a few more glasses and a funghi flatbread which was absolutely delicious by the way.   again, discount my initial frustration....evo is simply a great place.",

I ordered the squid ink pasta which was fair, I've had way better even in Phoenix. She proceeded to leave the salad on the table the entire dinner & dessert. Perhaps a sign that you WILL be paying for that salad and I'm leaving on your table as a reminder! ??  Because they charged me for two entrees (the salad was only $13 but still, I hated it!!!)

We waited for a little over an hour, but we were in no rush! Just enjoying each others company with a bottle of wine. The atmosphere was interesting... dark, candles, red... but played some hip hop genre music. I mean we aren't picky by any means. Just letting you know...that you should expect to hear those kinda tunes.  Due to our meal taking so long to get to us (my husbands lobster was a bit rubbery, my chicken was a bit dry but whatevs) the manager did take off basically a dish. He did this on his own, we didnt once complain so this is why I'm giving them 4 stars because the manager actually cared and was watching his floor. Unfortunately I did not get his name. Nice guy, and apologized for the wait. It was a kind gesture and we appreciated it!",

My boyfriend ordered their steak dish. Pasta was very chewy and they are definitely generous with the lobster. Steak was a bit under seasoned in my opinion and lacked flavor, but was cooked well.  Unfortunately I found a piece of plastic in my pasta dish, which was a bit unsettling. They immediately remade the dish for me but honestly I was too full to eat a second pasta dish and wished that they either gave me a discount or let me choose something different. Good think I had my boyfriend who managed to eat half of the second pasta so that we didn't waste it.  With the wine I ordered the bill was around $75. We definitely ate much better food for the same cost if not less in the area the ensuing days. If you are traveling and looking for a nice place to eat, I recommend checking out second story instead. It was much much better!",

The chicken was tough, almost like it was the scraps from a rotisserie chicken, the noodles did not taste handmade and the sauce on both dishes were very bland. The chili shrimp pasta wasn't even Spicy this time around. I thought this experience was very strange and disappointing. On a better note the ambiance and staff are amazing and great happy hour prices.",

Went to Coach House for some cocktails, at about 9:30 we were hungry, looked up what was close by, it was The Beverly, online it said they were open till 12. We went there, they were open, but told us that the kitchen was closed. They suggested EVO, acc. to their directions it seemed a little further than we wanted to walk so we strolled up  to Scottsdale Rd, figured there had to be something open on the main drag. Again, nothing open. One of the employees from anther restaurant that was closing up also suggested EVO, so we figured well if 2 people in the biz suggest them, then maybe we should go. Absolutely delish!! I had the kale/Brussel sprout salad to start, it was very tasty, my only suggestion is maybe a little more goat cheese to balance it out a little more. Then I had the shrimp fettuccine, fresh pasta, cooked perfectly in a pesto alfredo sauce, the shrimp were overcooked and rubbery, but honestly the pasta and sauce were so good, I could have eaten another bowl of it on it's own. Ambiance is a nice relaxed intimate setting.  It's not super pricey, drinks are, but it is Scottsdale. Great for a group gathering or a date night. Most importantly their kitchen is open till 2am. Will definitely be back!!",

Staff is extremely friendly.  The Arancini which is a fried risotto ball with meat sauce is a greater starter to any meal. Love the meat sauce. But the highly recommended starter or entree is the Evo salad. Brussel sprouts, kale, Bosc pear, chevre, pancetta, pine nuts in a sweet reduced balsamic is extraordinary. I still have dreams about this salad - which means I need to come back very soon!  I read that the wine is on tap in another review. Didn't try the last time I was there! Really looking forward to the salad, a pasta dish (since it is all homemade) or pizza and wine on tap for my next visit!",

    "text": "My husband Matt B. and I took a weekend trip to Phoenix, and decided we wanted some nice Italian food for our Saturday dinner. We found Evo on Yelp and managed a same-day 7:00 reservation. We were a little worried because there was a check-in special for a $0.01 fireball shot, but this proved to be at least somewhat incongruous with the restaurant.  The place was pretty classy, with nice decor, date-night lighting, and a decent crowd. We were seated near a bachelorette party, but it seemed like their first stop of the night. Our waiter was very friendly and earnest. He had the menu down pat and when I asked for recommendations, he gave detailed answers. I didn't need him to explain what squid ink pasta was, but I found his enthusiasm charming. Also, half an hour into our meal, I heard the man at the table next to us ask what kale was, and our waiter was ready.  We passed on the fireball shots (we'd actually had fireballs at a different kind of bar a few weeks earlier, and things ended poorly) and opted for a bottle of Nero d'Avola, which was good and decently priced. It went well with our meal.  We started with the charred octopus and the charcuterie board, and both were pretty great. The octopus was tender with a savory char, and it came with romesco and crispy pimento potatoes, which were lovely. The charcuterie board was definitely the centerpiece of our meal, a walloping board loaded with meat, cheese, bread, pickles, and other accompaniments. There was blackberry terrine, spicy salami, and mortadella; drunken goat cheese, Celtic cheddar, triple-creme brie, and manchego; golden raisin, fig jam, pickled okra; and on top of it all, a big split bone brimming with marrow. It was a bountiful feast, and everything on the platter was solidly tasty.  Pasta was almost overkill (in fact, our server warned us we might be getting too much food), but we went for it--we came to Evo craving pasta in the first place. Unfortunately, this course was a step down from the appetizers. I got the squid ink chittara, which sounded right up my alley--thin-cut pasta with lump crab, scallion, uni butter, Calabrian chile, and toasted breadcrumbs. None of these ingredients really stood out to me. The flavors were muted, and worse, the pasta clumped, making for gluey morsels. Matt's pappardelle was better, if not memorable, a basic plate of thick pasta with grana padano, tomato, basil, herbs, and a veal, pork, and beef ragu.  We passed on dessert and left quite full, more or less satisfied despite mediocre pastas. We enjoyed our dinner at Evo. The service and atmosphere were pleasant, and I'd recommend the place for a hearty meal centered around charcuterie and wine.",

We asked for recommendation as it was our first time and the waitress basically said it was \"modern Italian\"  and didn't go into detail about what's good.  After that she came by once to check on.   Probably the biggest issues was the cigarette smoke from the outside people, waiting to be seated. You could smell it throughout the restaurant.",

Angela served our every need. Beginning with two orders of what they call meatballs. These delectable morsels deserve a better name, than meatball. These little yummies were Amazing! Definitely a top 5 international contender for this 3 time Elite yelper. We ordered a pizza, shrimp pasta and a pork chop. Let's start with pizza. Perfect crust, perfect toppings, (mushroom and sausage) and sooooo good. Again, pizza is a poor description of what was delivered to our table.  The pork chop was an inch thick and juicy throughout. Again perfection. On to my selection, shrimp fettuccine. The pesto leaning gravy could have been served as a soup. Awesome. Shrimp prepared as they should. Did I mention the sauce. Yummm! Donny, the manager stopped by just to say hi. Another requirement for a five star rating, just saying. The finish...butter cake. Ok you can just come for the cake. This was our second visit. We'll be back!",

Everything we tried was tasty.   + Focaccia rustica- this was def my fave! Warm bread filled with creamy cheese, drizzled with honey. So fab. Way better than the version at Mora. + Grilled octopus- tender, tasty + House salad- basic but the greens are fresh, dressing good, and roasted tomatoes a nice touch + EVO salad- crispy Brussels sprouts, kale, pancetta. Wouldn't call this a healthy salad, but a tasty side + Burrata- creamy goodness, exactly like you'd expect + Lobster carbonara- tender gnocchi in a rich cream sauce tossed with chunks of lobster. Bonus for the clever presentation in a cracked tail. It's really rich so I'm glad we shared. + Squid in pasta- perfectly cooked and topped with all sorts of seafood Though I didn't try the meat options, my friends said the pork belly, ribeye, and porchetta were all good   Would return!",

We also received a complementary bottle of pink champagne from the restaurant since we were celebrating! They have a good sized menu and I couldn't complain about anything we ordered. The pasta is made in house and you can add a protein to any dish (fyi the meatballs are crazy big and oh, so good!!) i highly recommend the chicken fettuccine! I dont normally like pesto but the sauce on this is creamy and delicious. Portion sizes are really good for the prices! Dessert was also good and I recommend the butter cake- order it early ad it takes 25 minutes to cook.   Our server was amazing and very knowledgeable. He definitely made our dinner memorable!",

I hate to say, I didn't enjoy what I ordered all that much. The drinks were good! My friend and I both ordered raspberry mules. For dinner we started by splitting the Evo salad. It was okay, but not the lightest option. The salad is comprised of very crispy kale and fried brussel sprout shavings, accompanied by pancetta, pine nuts, and cheese. It was a little too heavy for my liking. I've actually had this salad before, and I really enjoyed it. It's almost like the brussel sprouts / kale / pancetta was too crispy and well done this time around.  We also split the chicken fettuccini entree. It was wayyyy too salty. I wanted to really like it because the underlying flavors of the pesto and cream sauce were there (and the pasta itself was amazing). I think for next time I'll try a different salad, and pasta dish. I can tell that Evo is a quality establishment, and definitely worth giving another try. I know they also have some fab happy hour deals! I'll be taking advantage of those next time I come in.",

The focaccia rustica is so sweet and light and it's the perfect appetizer, and it won't get you too full before your entree. Scallops are amazing and the risotto that comes with it is so yummy. Every time we come here we're amazed by the food.  Service: Unfortunately, the service gets worse and worse every time we come in. This time, we waited 20 minutes before our server, Caitlyn, even greeted us at the table, and there was only two other tables in the dining room. It took a long time to get our drinks too. Finally when they came, (I ordered hot tea) she brought out a box of tea for me to choose from. After I chose my tea, she literally just left the big box of tea just sitting there on our table for half of our evening. No one came by to pick it up to put it back in the server's station where it belonged, until it was almost time for our entrees. It was kinda awkward. She also gave us the wrong wine. We tried getting her attention so we could get the right one, but she didn't come by for a long time. We tried getting her attention as she would walk back and forth in front of us, but no luck. Finally we thought it just wasn't worth it anymore, because even if we got her attention and told her it was the wrong wine, we would have to wait and extra 10+ minutes to get it, so we just stopped trying. Our visits before this have been similar (long time waiting to be greeted, long time waiting for drinks), but this time was kinda bad. We LOVE the food, but are so torn because the service is not prioritized at EVO. It might be awhile until we come back, which sucks because the food is so good.",

Our experience started off on the wrong foot when we walked in.  We had 6:30 reservations for a table for four.  When we checked in, we were told that our table was ready, but because they were busy that night, we'd need to vacate the table by 8 PM.  What kind of a restaurant greets people like that?  We objected and were seated at a different table that had no such time restriction.  So we thought that the worst was behind us now that we were no longer under pressure to be done in 90 minutes,  Unfortunately, we had several other misses.  Our waiter was not as attentive as we think he should have been.  He did not follow up to offer us additional drinks, and was late to check in on us after the meal was served.  One of our party asked for her meal to be made without red pepper flakes.  The kitchen either didn't get the request or erred in preparing the meal.  When our dining companion discovered the miss, it took too long for the waiter to get back to the table to make sure that our meals were tasty.  The waiter did offer to either prepare a new meal or attempt to tone down the spice.  Given the time lapse between serving the meal and checking up on us, our dining companion opted to have the dish modified a bit to avoid waiting another 15 minutes or so for a new meal.  Unfortunately, it didn't work out so well.  Her meal was still too spicy for her.  Finally, we had a $20 off mailer that we presented with the bill.  When we got the check back, the $20 was not taken off of the bill.  We brought that error to our server's attention, and he corrected it.  I will say that to the restaurant's credit, the other three meals and the dessert were great.  Unfortunately, the service aspect and the one meal tainted our experience.",

    "text": "We visited EVO while on a weekend trip to Scottsdale that happened to be during a period of perfect 80 degree weather, as a result our experience was based on their small but cute patio.     Atmosphere: Evo provides delicious Italian dining in a non-pretentious atmosphere, overall the decor is  fairly modern and does a good job of pulling in local materials.  While the patio is small so I would suggest reservations specifying outdoor seating if that is what you prefer.  The patio does not have much in the way of shade but did appear to have water misters for hotter times, that said it really starts to shine and have charm once the sun goes down and the strings of outdoor lights come on and compliment the blue glow from the patio's rock walls.  The location is on the edge of Old Scottsdale and is on a fairly busy street so there is a lot of traffic; however, it is great to have the view of the sun setting behind Camelback as you dine!  Service: Service was excellent, Kaitlynn was attentive and clearly was paying attention to details.  We found ourselves unable to finish the meal and Kaitlynn boxed our food for us and labeled each box with the contents and date (an extra detail I always appreciate!).  Food: We started with the Pork Belly appetizer which was delicious and well constructed...honestly I could have happily made a meal of that alone!  For mains we tried the Chicken Picatta and my Fiancee had the Bolognese.  Both entrees were delicious and were well portioned, neither of us felt like we had massive plates but there was certainly not a lack of food.  The sauce for the chicken Picatta was creamy and fairly garlic forward without being overwhelming, personally I prefer a bit more lemon flavor in my Picatta but that is a personal preference.    Drinks: We stuck to a bottle of Reisling for this meal, the bottle prices are reasonable and in line with what we would expect.  The wine was served chilled in a bucket of ice.    Overall we had a great experience and would happily return next time we are in Scottsdale!",

The service was equally as inadequate. Too many great restaurants in town to settle for mediocrity.",

The noise level in the restaurant was very high with diners laughing & shouting, we could hardly have conversation - but it was NYE, so I shall not complain about that. So, why am I giving the least number of stars? The server (a tall Brunette female). I noticed that she started having an attitude after finding out that we were not going to order any alcohol. And when I gave her $120 cash for a bill of $118.72, she decided to keep the change and when I asked for it, she said \"it's only a dollar and change\" and shrugged her shoulders. Mind you, she DID get tipped decently ($20) in addition to the change I was supposed to receive. I decided not to crate a scene & embarrass my company (and myself) in front of the cloud, so I just walked out after letting her know about the chair (the one I was seated on) falling apart (I am only about 180lbs so it was not me that destroyed the chair bottom). The otherwise decent NYE dinner experience was ruined by this snobby & inconsiderate waiting staff.Therefore, I just cannot recommend EVO to anyone.",

From the gorgeous greeters to the helpful bartenders I thoroughly enjoyed my visit.   Ambiance. This place is bigger than expected. They have a restaurant section, and then a bar with booths and a nice open \"loungier\" area by the windows. Very nice for mingle activities. I was only here a Friday for Happy Hour, it will be really interesting to see how it develops into the wee hours of the night, and how the clientele changes.  Drinks They have a decent Happy Hour menu that I was very tempted by, but I had dinner reservations so I kept my HH all wet. This being said, they have stuff like Nitro Milk Stout from Left Hand Brewing Company and that is awesome in itself. Nice selection of wine too.  I will definitely come back to EVO.. as soon as possible!!!",

For food, we got the cheese board (which is gigantic and full of amazing meats and cheeses). We also shared the focaccia which was nothing short of AMAZING. It had mascarpone cheese on top and was drizzled with honey. Need I say more?  We each ordered a different pasta dish and ended up sharing. Everything was SO good! Our server was great and very friendly. He made some great wine recommendations for us and quickly cleared our table of the seemingly endless parade of dishes we went through that night.

    "text": "I'm very torn between giving this place a 3 star or a 4 star. =/  The first time I came here was for a Yelp event Lindsey put together last year. It was amazing and everything was perfect. So my friend wanted to go to dinner, and I wanted to find a place that had happy hour on Sundays. This place has happy hour every day from 4-7. Perfect right?  They also have live music after 8 pm on Sundays too. Plus I've been here before and after such a good experience, sold!   So for drinks, I wanted the Canteloupe Tini, it was amazing the first time. They didn't have it! What!? First fail. =/ So I got a Cosmo. Definitely got my money's worth on that. Ok for food, they had the house made pasta on the list. They didn't have it! What!? That's two for two. So I ordered the Funghi pizza. This comes with mushrooms, mozarella, tomato sauce, pecorino - herbs. Our waiter, (Tony) suggested I added duck to it. And it tasted amazing.   I'm torn between the 3 or 4 star because how can you not have both of these items on the menu? But, Tony our server was amazing. He was so knowledgeable of everything on the menu. & I pretty much ordered everything he suggested. You're getting a 4 star Evo. Thank Tony! =P",

No flavor at all and pasta was very over cooked. This visit no offer for grated Parmesan cheese. Everyplace offers that and comes to the table and hand grates it. We had to ask and then they brought a shaker that looked like Kraft Parmesan in the green canisters. A lot of little things that just didn't add up for a restaurant of this caliber and this expense.",

The angel hair bologness,  the waiter comes out and says we do not have angel hair pasta, my boyfriend asks what are your pastas then? ,Uh i dont know let me check , we have spaghetti  Ok, well do that , When the plate arrives it is to very small and the noodles are not spaghetti, it is over done freeze dried ramen with a very bland watery sauce The calamarie, small portion chewy with a sauce made up of nothing but water with a little tomato paste , you clain to be True italian food No, this place is not authentic italian food, Shame on you  I do not know how you can call what we had food, nor how you can serve it, I am sorry we had to pay for a poor evening out  Perhaps we ordered the wrong things i would like to know what makes it so great, it cant be the food so what is it? Be known this review should be one star however because the service was good its getting two stars although it should only be one point 5 but yelp will not allow half stars *this review has nothing to do with our server,despite a little rocky he was great*",

    "text": "After reading rave reviews about this place on Yelp and on TripAdvisor, my mom and I decided we wanted to give it a try. It doesn't look like much from the street, but the parking lot was packed at 7pm on a Thursday. We had made a reservation earlier that day on OpenTable and we were shown to a table right away.  The ambience is romantic but also casual. It's a little bit louder than average, but part of that is because it features some open patio seating and you can hear a little bit of outside Scottsdale through the open patio doors.  We had the Lobster Carbonara and Roasted Funghi pizza. They were both AMAZING. We almost licked both plates clean. We went ahead and also got the Brown Butter Babycake. It takes 25minutes to prepare, but it was so amazing. The outside is crunchy but the inside is perfectly chewy-gooey.   And the price is much cheaper than I would've expected for such exceptional food. Definitely recommend this gem!",

EVO's Steak Bruschetta comes with Tenderloin carpaccio, creme de brie, grilled asparagus and truffle oil. The creamy creme de brie pairs perfectly with the carpaccio.   The Cast Iron Lasagna is homemade pasta layered with mozzarella, starcciatella, bolognese, Parmesan and herbs. The pasta was good, but was too thick for my personal taste. Other than that, no complaints!   Calling all meat lovers! The Salumaria Pizza is topped with pepperoni, sausage and spicy salami. I wasn't able to finish the pizza, the leftovers made a great lunch.",

We called to RSVP but wanted to sit outside since the weather was beautiful and asked if there were heaters so when it got chilly at night. They said yes.   We got seated for our table and ordered drinks and our meals. I ordered an extra dirty martini and zucchini noodle dish. I asked to switch the  pomodoro sauce to the alfredo garlic brussel sauce but was told it would be a $4 up charge to do that, so I kept the pomodoro. Very unnecessary.   Needless to say, the zucchini noodle and extra dirty martini were delicious. Loved the whole mushrooms in the dish!   A couple of my friends had the chicken fettuccine dish and it looked yummy and they said they'd come back for it again.   We told our server it was our friends birthday and to bring out a dessert and she dragged so much that we almost left right before she brought it. She also put everyone's meals on one receipt (8 people) even though she was marking who got what and where we were sitting.  The night started getting chilly, even with a light coat on, so we asked them to turn on the two heaters next to the sides of our table. One didn't work, the other only worked for 5 minutes. So much for asking ahead of time if they had decent working heaters.   It's a fun and beautiful restaurant. I would definitely come back but sit inside.",

    "text": "Romantic setting inside. Nice priced happy hour menu. Ordered the calamari and the meatballs for appetizer. The calamari was plated beautifully but had zero flavor and was difficult to eat. The meatball texture tasted wonderful but had an inconsistent texture. We split the squid ink chittara and it was wonderful. A lot of garlic! The service was not great. We weren't checked on or asked if we wanted anything else. I would not go back. Too overpriced for sub par food and service.",

We had the Zucchini and later at the Dave Matthews concert we started talking about how good dinner was as well as pointing out how Tim Reynolds looks like an alien. Later in an Uber I suggested the Uber goes and tries it. At 3 in the morning in the ER after a scooter accident we agteed, well at least that dinner was great! Now it is 11:27 AM and all I'm doing is thinking about the food at Evo. I never write review but this place deserved it.",

Food is consistently amazing, vibe is really cool, prices are reasonable, and the kitchen is open late (midnight or later).  We usually end up ordering way too much food and sharing the plates. The great thing about Italian food is it's sometimes even better as leftovers :) For apps, you can't go wrong with the focaccia rustica or meatballs. The focaccia is something truly unique to EVO, and I love the meatballs so much that I've actually ordered them as an entree! The lasagna is always my go-to dinner, but the lobster gnocchi is out of this world as well. To end your evening, you absolutely have to order the brown butter cake. So simple but divine!  I always bring out of town guests here, and this is one of my favorite spots to celebrate an occasion of any type.",

    "text": "I spent a week celebrating the start of the holidays with my family in Old Town Scottsdale, and we tried a number of restaurants during our time together. EVO, without a doubt, takes the brown butter baby cake and stands out among the rest.   The hostess sat us ahead of our reservation time, and we soon met our awesome waitress, Audrey. The restaurant was completely full on a weekend night, but Audrey anticipated our needs like new glasses of wine, the speed to bring out our courses, and after dinner drinks like a pro.   We started with an appetizer with bread, goat cheese, and pesto, and it was so tasty. I knew as soon as I spread the pesto and cheese mix onto the perfectly toasted bread that this place was going to be legit. The beet salad was so tasty and fresh (although the pretty slate cheese board plate was a bit odd to navigate a salad on).   I enjoyed the eggplant ragout for my main course, although I wished the eggplant was sliced a bit thiner to get a nicer crisp to it. My relatives loved their lasagna and chicken scallopini milanese. Our only wish was for free bread with our main course, which I found it odd that the restaurant does not offer as an Italian place.   But back to that brown butter baby cake: Order it when you order your main course, and you will be treated to the most outstanding dessert in  Scottsdale. It was pure perfection.   EVO was a treat, and it will be my first stop on my future visits to Scottsdale.",

There are not enough characters here to explain it.   My only complaint is they changed the EVO Salad.   Much smaller now and seemed like they batch made them.   Our joke with friends is order the EVO salad for starters, an EVO salad as a main then try the EVO salad as dessert. Amazing.   This time was a bit off - the portions were in much smaller bowls which made it much harder to mix and unfortunately two or those at our table had tons of cheese and apples and balsamic. I had just one small piece of cheese, one tiny piece of apple and my salad was nearly dry. Other person at the table had cheese, no apples, and was dry. We ordered extra balsamic - but in the end I wish we had sent them back. It just was meh at best.   Also the kale/brussel ratio was a lot different - usually 50/50 now 80%+ kale.   The two others raved about the salad - except it was impossible to mix.   I will be back, maybe it was an off night and someone dropped all the salad bowls and broke them and the brussel sprouts, cheese and apples revolted against the smaller bowls.   All in all this place is the bomb. Just an off night ... I hope.",

My favorite appetizers are the scallops, the Polpetinas (meatballs) and the charcuterrie board. You have to try the Evo salad! Its different than any salad I've ever tried and is definitely worth the trip.  I have frequented the establishment many times and have never been disappointed with the food or the drinks. The specialty cocktails are playful and fresh. I would recommend the Evo Maid or the Monroe Mule to start but I suggest trying them all.   This is a great place for an after work drink as well as dinner with the family. The staff is knowledgeable and ready to please. The owner is always there making sure the guests are enjoying themselves.This is my new favorite restaurant. Well Done!",

The waiter took our drink order. It was nearly 30 minutes before our drinks were brought to the table. We then placed our dinner order. 45 minutes after placing our orders, the waiter approached the table and said that they only had enough lobster for 2 lobster risottos. 5 in our group had ordered this. Meals were brought to the table a full 2 hours after arriving at the restaurant and 1.5 hours after ordering. Only half of the meals were delivered at that time. The rest trickled out over the next 20 minutes. We had requested drink refills and received none,  or even water. After asking to speak with the manager, the situation improved with his attention but the waiter became rude and clipped. The food was mediocre. The final blow was the bill reflected 5 lobster risottos when only 2 were received. The other 3 switched to a different (and much cheaper) protein in chicken or shrimp. As a group, none of us were impressed and certainly would not go back.",

    "text": "It's tough to write a review when our experience hosted both top-notch AND crappy aspects. So, 3/5 it is.  I called Saturday midday to reserve a birthday party table for 8 and they happily set it up for that night. When we got there, they had printed \"Happy Birthday, Stephanie!\" at the top of the menus...nice touch! We also checked in on Yelp for .1c fireball shots. Great way to start off the evening. We immediately got a round of wine and cocktails while we perused the menu. They had a $6 wine of the night, and it was really good.  Unfortunately, it went downhill QUICK. Our server was nice enough when at the table, but neglected to come around...hardly at all. We weren't ready right away, so asked for a few minutes with the menus....we waited so long for her to come back that we ended up getting the hostess to send someone over. By that time, all our drinks were dry, and everyone was starving. So, we placed our orders, and waited.  and waited. and waited. then a salad came out....so that girl sat with her dinner in front of her for another 10 minutes while the rest of us waited on our hot food. It wasn't that busy, and I am typically very lenient on high-volume kitchens, but this was really out of control. The wait wouldn't have been so bad if we didn't have to hunt someone down for every water refill or new cocktail. We finally got our food after 50 minutes, and (you guessed it) one of the pizzas was wrong...unfortunately it wasn't a situation where she could just deal with it due to allergies. The pizza was remade but didn't come out until everyone else was finished. Awkward.  The manager came over and was very chipper, but didn't offer to do anything to make it better. Another round of .1c shots or a 'comped pizza would have gone a long way.  The icing on the missing birthday cake was just that--all evening there were bday desserts being delivered, with candles, sometimes with a song. Our server just dropped the check and walked away. We almost just dismissed it, but we could tell the bday girl was disappointed so, again, someone went to talk to the hostess. Eventually the server brought out a complimentary dessert, but without a candle, and with an evident side of grudge. It was just such a damper on what had started out so well.   I will go back some time and see if another server offers a better experience--the vibe of the place is definitely cool and I like the location a lot.",

    "text": "We came here last year after evo opened and had a great experience. We remembered the food and service were very good.  So we went again last weekend expecting to have another good dining experience but we were disappointed.  I started with the italian wedding soup which was pretty good. Then I had roasted chicken for entree and when she brought it out I was so surprised.. there were 2 very small cuts of the chicken breast and one tiny drumstick, with a few potatoes and tomatoes.   For $17, I was expecting a reasonable sized portion..and its not like chicken is an expensive meat where you expect to get a tiny portion. My friend got the pork belly risotto and she got a big bowl of risotto. Since that was heavy andd rich, I would have thought it would make sense to have a smaller portion of that instead.   The service was disappointing.  The waitress didnt come back to check with us after the food came out. It would have been nice to order another glass of wine. When we were finished she gave us the check and didnt even ask how the food was or say  thanks for coming in.  Unfortunately I wont be coming back here.",

You would think it wouldn't take 15 minutes to serve a glass of wine and a beer since there were no patrons.  We found the menu to be very limiting.  In fact, the chef's daily bruschetta was a concoction of red pepper paste and anchovies, of which we steered clear.  We thought a pepperoni pizza would be safe... But after the 30 minute wait after ordering, we were rethinking the whole deal.  Our waiter was nowhere to be found, so we flagged down a bus-person, ordered a second drink and waited for our pizza which did eventually arrive - burned.  The real wait started at this point.  No second drink ever arrived, no waiter, no check up.  At 6:45 we finally left money on the table and walked out.  No bill ever came and no wait staff ever checked on us.  It was ridiculous.  We won't be returning.",

We both got the squid ink pasta, as it's been SO hard to find outside of Venice, Italy and it's one of our favorites.  Evo's version is a bit spicier than other versions I've had -- which we both loved!!  Such a unique dish that they have made their own.  We got the brown butter cake for dessert, which was beyond delicious.  Not sure what it is exactly but it was essentially heaven in your mouth.  Will definitely keep coming back to this neighborhood gem.",

    "text": "I was REALLY disappointed with our service last night. It was a Monday night so it wasn't very busy. My friend and I ordered a charcuterie board, which arrived in a timely manner. Our waitress, while polite, set it down and turned to walk away. We stopped her asking her to explain all the items. She did not know much of what we'd been served. Another waitress came by to help and she wasn't very familiar with the items either. I ordered a glass of wine, one that is on tap and listed on the menu for $7. Our waitress disappeared. Quite a bit of time went by and I did not see her so I flagged down the bartender. He brought me my drink with apologies. Another friend joined us and nobody came by to greet her so we flagged down the second server, who appeared to be on break. Eventually our server came by again and we ordered a round of drinks. This time I ordered a slightly more expensive glass of wine that was not on tap. Soon after, we saw our drinks sitting on the bar. After some time passed, the bartender delivered them with apologies again. I was given the wrong glass of wine. Once I realized this, I walked up to the bar to get what I'd ordered. Given that our server was absent the majority of the time, I'd assumed she'd ordered it incorrectly. But when our bill came, the items on the bill were correct. The bartender had poured me the cheaper glass of wine and I was still being charged for the more expensive glass. Not everyone would recognize this mistake so I felt as though he was intentionally trying to rip me off. And then that first $7 glass of wine showed up on the bill as $8. I wouldn't normally complain over a dollar, but given the series of circumstances that occurred during the night, I felt like we were intentionally being mistreated. The bartender said he'd fix the mistake.   When I receive awful service, I don't want to return to the establishment. I've been a server. I understand everybody has bad days. But I felt like all 3 people waiting on us made our night stressful. Stress is exactly what we are trying to escape when my friends and I go out together. I don't think I'll ever return to EVO.",

There were hardly anyone in the restaurant, but there's a live DJ playing dancey stuff. Ok, interesting.   We got excited after looking at the menu, esp with all the rave reviews here. The server was very peppy as well. Then the nightmare began..  - All the protein entrees \"apparently\" were not available. - We ordered meatballs appetizer and it was great! We re-ordered but now it's not available anymore! - We ordered bread with pesto and then I tasted the sauce, it's not pesto. When I asked, he said \"Oh I just whipped that up in the kitchen just now. We don't have pesto.\" Umm... were you trying to test me if I know what pesto is? And hoping I won't even notice it? - My pasta entree came first before anybody else's APPETIZER. And it was the most horrible thing actually. It's their \"new\" menu with Amatriciana sauce and they were testing it out! Yuck! Worst Amatriciana I've ever had; did not taste anything like it. - Then we waited... and waited... and waited... and the music got LOUDER. #nightmare - One of our orders were lost in the process. - In all fairness, the server was super nice, but his effort in giving us free desserts to remedy the situation made things worse. We waited even longer to get out of here, and the desserts were just OFF. When I compared the pictures on Yelp with what we got, something was definitely wrong here...  We won't be coming back.",

The food and drink service was super slow and the restaurant wasn't even packed, so I can't give any discount to the servers. Wrong drink was served at our table, not a biggie. Server spoke with sort of a condescending tone, and came across as if he knew everything about food and downplayed most of our food and drink choices. Usually I appreciate this, but given the condescending tone of the sever, I couldn't. Server mimicked one of our friends when she was talking when he brought out the bill, he thought we wouldn't notice but awkwardly for him, everyone on the table noticed. Still would recommend this place because the food was really good.  Suggestion to the restaurant: Please check the attitude of your servers, the food is amazing and you don't want to lose repeat customers due to something as trivial as an uninterested employee. Also would like to clarify that I'm just talking about 1 server actually who was assigned to our table.",

    "text": "So I have been a food rut and haven't really been inspired to want to try to make something at home. But Chef Pete has totally blown me away with EVo. I don't even know where to start.  Well first the must have drinks are Grapefruit Basil if are looking for something tarte and refreshing but the John mule its all the right notes if you are looking for a little sweet and a favor you just can't pin point. For Apps: MUST get the Spiced Pork Belly- if you love watermelon salad this take you to a totally different world great texture, right amount of spice, and the home made pickle watermelon rinds.. the well season super tender pork.I can get this all day and just thinking the salty and the crisp sweet watermelon mmmm The raviolo- is this huge homemade truffle ricotta goodness with the cuper crisp bacon bits to give the salt you need.   Totally something I never had before was their beef heart sandwich which has this amazing homemade mustard seed. My fellow elite Jody favorite was the  EVo salad and i love it just as much but the brussel sprout leave were charred to perfection and the micro pear bites was such a better idea then when you get those large slices that you would have to cut.  We also had the chicken thigh and bone marrow, equally really good if you are looking for comfort food.   After all this yes we still shared two pasta dishes! How can you not- they all homemade too. If you are looking spicy you have to get the squid ink pasta- its creamy with a hint of uni favor but the pasta is cooked to perfection and then you get hit with a little heat of spice after every bite, it not too spicy as you keep going so you end up eating the whole thing and realized you forgot to get a bite of the huge crab chunks.  The Fadellini- that classic clam sauce with a twist and it was a lighter version with these beautifully made pasta.  Price point- we under price for the quality and service you are getting here as some of these dishes in Chicago or NYC would be much higher so totally worth checking out.    Great play on texture, hitting all favors of salty, sweet, sour, etc in each dish and honestly hard to bored.",

Bruschetta with asparagus and beef loin was amazing. So goood that I order another one. Capresa salad was amazing as well. For my entree I order the chile shrimp past. Im from Brazil and I love spicy food. But this one was away to spicy. But it was still good. If u dont like really spixy food stay way from this one. My wife had Alfredo with shrimp. It was bomb. Kids food was amazing as well. They dont have to much on their menu.. but u dont need quantities.. u definitely need quality and that my friend.. They HAVE. Service wasnt all that.. but I didnt really care. Im in the industry and I understand that openning a restaurant is not easy. Overall... I WILL BE BACK AND THIS IS ONE OF MY NEW FAVOR SPOTS TO HAVE DIN DIN ON SUNDAYS WITH THE FAMILY.",

The presentation for the food is on point, tastes delicious, and they were pretty solid on filling the waters.   I'll definitely be going back so I get a chance to try everything on the menu. I also want to check it out on a Friday or Saturday night. Looks like the bar could get poppin, there's a small lounging area, and an outside patio to be explored.  The PBLT is BOMB.  ~ TheWaterGuy",

The ambiance is very nice as well, though I feel really bad for whoever has to light all those candles.  There are A LOT of them.  Unfortunately the food wasn't great.  The bruschetta we had was literally shrimp on bread, and both my steak sandwich and my date's pizza were just OK.    It took probably 30 minutes for our entrees to come out.  Maybe they were short-staffed that night, and maybe other nights the food is better, but what we experienced wasn't as good as we hoped it would be.",

You have to try the pizzas, chicken sandwich, or bruschetta.. But for dessert you HAVE to get the zeppolini's (Italian donut-holes). UNREAL. Made fresh in-house, lightly dusted with sugar and cinnamon, and when you pull them apart they steam... Then you dunk them in the chilled, house-made vanilla bean frosting.. and, ugh. It's just so damn good.",

    "text": "Great new restaurant in Scottsdale! When you walk in, the vibe is sophisticated and warm. They have a full bar and full dining room, so no matter what - there is something for everyone. They specialize in Italian dishes with a twist and amazing cocktails. Our server, Jarness, recommended some cocktails - which we ordered. Over the course of dinner we had tried the Grapefruit Basil, Pit of Passion, and a spin on a Moscow Mule called the 'Monroe Mule' (which had a raspberry flavor to it). All of which, I would order again.   On to dinner: We got the EVO Salad (which Jarness recommended) - which has kale, brussel sprouts and other yummy things. The salad was unlike any salad I've ever had. The kale and brussels were baked/broiled and mixed together. This was my favorite item I tried, and would order again.  We also ordered a Caprese salad and a Funghi pizza. The pizza was a perfect size to share (10\"). We finished everything we ordered.   In addition to a great dinner, they also offer a late night menu (kitchen closes at 1am) which offers a lot of the same items.   The food was awesome, and I'm excited to come back to try new items! On a separate, but incredibly important note: The service was fantastic. Our server was knowledgeable, personable and really made us feel welcome. The owner was also present on the floor, and stopped by to see how our experience was. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "L says- \"A place to have cocktails and a few quick bites, but nothing more.\"  J says-\"The Roasted Cauliflower and EVO Maid will not disappoint, but have dinner elsewhere.\"  First Impression/Ambiance First impression was great. The hostess was friendly and the restaurant was rustic and cozy. Interior was a mix of hardwoods, black booths and red napkins with white dinnerware. We noticed we were the only diners in the dining room (this was an early dinner for us 5:00) and the bar was where the people were at. We were hopeful for what flavors awaited us since we had gone on a clean eating relatively bland diet this past week to trim down.   Drinks Our server greeted us and helped us choose 2 seasonal cocktails - one with melon and another light and refreshing drink. The first disappointment was the 2 drinks were unavailable because they didn't have the ingredients. We Settled on 2 additional drinks, the MONROE'S MULE and EVO MAID. 28 minutes after our arrival we finally had our drinks. They were delicious and refreshing so we decided to remain open to the rest of the experience.  Food NOBLE BREAD SERVICE -We've had Noble bread at other dining establishments and have been very pleased. For an appetizer to be labeled as a \"service\" I was expecting something more extravagant than 6 pieces of bread in a single rustic loaf flavor with cup of pesto with a dollop of ricotta. Definitely skip the bread service, as grilled bread points are served with the roasted cauliflower (bonus!).  ROASTED CAULIFLOWER- We love ordering at least 1 vegetable appetizer to really test the kitchen's ability. Anyone can put vegetables on a plate, but it takes a True chef to make them delectable. This dish did not disappoint- brown roasted cauliflower on a bed of smooth hummus with crispy chickpeas, olive tapenade and grilled toast points as a garnish. This was by far THE best item we ordered...which is sad considering the appetizers should entice you to what lies ahead in the main course.  LOCAL GREENS, a simple salad with very fresh vegetables. The only problem was the overpowering vinaigrette. L said \"I didn't want to pickle these vegetables. I wanted a salad.\" TAGLIATELLE PASTA WITH POMODORO SAUCE- Pasta was homemade with \"flour, water, and love\" but we have to admit Chef Marcellino a few blocks over wins in this category. The pasta was ok, and drowning in pomodoro. Normally, the pomodoro pasta comes with spaghetti but as the server said..\"wow this dish looks so much better with the subbed Tagliatelle noodles.\" At least she was honest. ROASTED MUSHROOM PIZZA- Admittedly, we have very discriminate tastes when it comes to pizza. There are very few places in AZ that fulfill our pizza desires. Unfortunately, this pizza did not make the cut. The crust was bland, the sauce was lacking depth of flavor and the mushrooms weren't all that plentiful.   Service For being the only table seated in the dining room and seeing the bar crowd order very few items, I was disappointed at how long it took to receive our food and drinks. The chef was very nice, and came over trying to sell the specials (48 oz Porterhouse for 2, whole branzino for 2,  and braciole) but I noticed he did that to all subsequent guests. While L would have considered these specials....he needed a partner in crime to help eat this.. J being vegetatrian is not up for this challenge. He also pushed their Sunday Brunch. So perhaps that would fare better than dinner? We think we will leave that up to other diners to try.",

    "text": "A-OK about sums it up. We visited in June when EVO was (I believe) newly opened. It's in a weird location--you could miss it if you weren't looking. They have their own parking lot which was great!   We arrived at a weird time (around 5pm) so the place was deserted, and the hostess seated us at a table that had crumbs and dust all over it. It seemed really strange that with every table in the place open, she'd bring us to that one. She reseated us immediately after we pointed out the crumbs (and there were a lot of them--she should have seen them as we were approaching the table).   After that little glitch, service/staff was friendly and excellent (including from the hostess who had seated us). Drinks were cheap for happy hour, so that was cool. The food was just okay. We had the caprese salad which had little flavor and I believe some sort of risotto balls, which were good. I don't recall our entrees. I remember thinking it was an okay meal, but not outstanding in any way taste-wise.   We may give EVO another try once they've been open for a while to see if the food has improved--from the other more recent reviews, it looks like it might have.",

We sat at the bar and I must start by say that the bartenders were friendly, attentive and made a good drink.  We started with the tenderloin bruschetta which was rather disappointing, the \"tenderloin\" was not like any tenderloin I have ever had, I ended up spitting out more than I could chew due to all the fat and gristle.  For entrees we tried the lobster risotto and the New York strip dinners. First off, very overpriced and mediocre flavors to both. And I believe this is the only place I have ever been where your dinner does not come with a soup or salad to start until I came to Evo. $32 for New York strip dinner and $24 for the Lobster risotto I though was a little much for what you get.  3 stars only due to the cleanliness and service.",

The service was great and the restaurant was cute and very sultry -- good for groups or a date, but the food didn't wow me.. and it hurt!  We arrived and were promptly seated. Our waiter was attentive and kept the bread and garlic infused oil (which was fantastic) coming after he realized our group was very hungry. We started with some apps -- risotto balls (on a meat sauce, boo) and the bruschetta. Which was okay. Then we ordered our entrees. I had the chile shrimp.. which was okay.. it seemed the shrimp was overcooked and the noodles a step before al dente (re: ultra firm/borderline crunchy). Most everyone had similar feels about the food just being okay.  So would I come back, yep.. with the focus on maybe pre-drinks or good times with friends. The place really did lend itself to that. Very modern decor and a warm space.",

During dinner, I had the EVO salad and the bolognese pasta. My two friends really loved the salad but it was a bit too balsamic-y for my taste. I would have liked a little bit more of another flavor to balance out. The bolognese though was fantastic (how can you mess up my favorite food though). I would definitely recommend.",

From what the owner told us, everything is made in house and sourced locally whenever possible. The taste and quality of our food reflected this.   We sampled something of each portion of the menu except the salads. We started with the bruschetta. It was phenomenal. Our entrees were a pepperoni pizza and the chicken over greens. They were both melt-in-your-mouth delicious.   Desert was an artistic take on a s'more- a brownie with Nutella, marshmallow fluff and gram crackers. Sweet but not overly so- the perfect finish to the meal.  The absolute stand out to me, however, was the drink I had. Even if the food was terrible (which it obviously wasn't) I would come back just for the drink. Try the Blueberry Basil Lime Tonic. You wont regret it. They also keep a number of wines on tap- which is extra cool. Wine's on tap make sure your glass is aerated by the time it gets to you, it also significantly reduces waste.  This is surely going to become a hot spot. I don't see how it wont. Come try it while it's new, so you can get in before the crowding gets out of hand!",

    "text": "Outstanding new restaurant in Old Town - looks like 3rd time's the charm in this location.   Previous owner(s) had tried a few different things that apparently didn't pan out. Well, the new owner of this spot apparently knows what's up.  The specialty cocktails (which I'm not normally into) are fantastic, and their wine on tap is awesome. The food is out of this world - it's all different. They are really into locally sourced fresh ingredients and being earth conscious (which I really appreciate) and you can taste the difference in the food.   I had a pepperoni pizza and shared some bruschetta that was crazy good, and my girlfriend had a chicken dish I sampled that was also amazing. The cheese on the pizza was creamy - it was really unusual, but I scarfed down every bit of it. The crust was delicious as well.   The best part is that I don't feel boated or whatever. I was full, but didn't have a gut bomb. We even split a dessert that was like their take on an adult s'more. It was ridiculous.   Evo should be a yelper's paradise. This is going to be a really hot spot for an after work happy hour when you don't feel like having a Corona and chips and salsa. It's also a fantastic spot for a date night. It's an awesome place for locals to come and unwind with a drink and some noshes.  There's a really comfy atmosphere and everyone that works there seems passionate and welcoming. I hope they keep it up after the \"we're new\" wears off. I wish this place all the success and I hope it's around for years to come. I'm definitely going to be back here lots.

    "text": "Ah EVO, the ball was dropped for me this weekend. I came into the restaurant on Friday for a dinner with a bunch of friends, and maybe my expectations were a little too high.   The previous few times I've come in for happy hour in the bar and everything has been great - from the apps to the service. The bar has always been great. However, this particular night, the food was lacking and the service was spotty...at best.  From the time we sat down, there was easily a 15 minute wait before anyone came to the table to greet the party and take a drink order - let alone bring water to the group. It took so long that my buddy and I went to the bar to get drinks for us and our lady friends (plus the 1 cent shot of Fireball upon using your Yelp check-in). When the drinks went dry, lo-and-behold, the server never came by asking to get in a drink order from us, so again we went to the bar. Only this time, the server fervently came up and asked, \"hey have I not been to the table enough? Is that why you guys are coming up and ordering from the bar?\" Uhhh - yeah, that would be an accurate assessment of the situation, glad you caught it when we were AT THE BAR ordering drinks.  As someone who worked in the service industry for 7 years, on the floor and behind the bar, I don't ever think there would be a situation where asking a guest why they're ordering from the bar instead of the server would be appropriate (maybe from a Management standpoint - but not from the server). And if your inclination is because you haven't been attentive enough to the table, maybe the intuition you have regarding the situation is the correct one.   The food reviews were mixed as the apps and salads were good, but the entrees of pasta that myself and my girlfriend had were lacking in flavor. The spicy shrimp pasta was extremely oily and unappetizing. The service on the floor was poor, especially considering it was a Friday night, and the restaurant was not that busy for the latter part of the evening. The bar service was on point per usual which is why I still have given the restaurant 3 stars.   I realize this review is lengthy, and if you've made it this far down, congrats. However, quality and attentive service in a restaurant is of paramount importance. In many cases, it can even make up for a poorly executed entree experience. Friday night, it just wasn't there on the dining room floor. I'll come back to EVO for happy hour, but for dinner, I'm not quite so sure.",

    "text": "Finally, it seems that this location is taking off.  It was amazing how dead it was when we visited the prior restaurant in this location, despite the good food.  However, Evo has amp'd up the atmosphere, maintained the good service, and produced some tasty food.  Thus, the place was hoppin' on a Friday evening and for a change, it was hard to find a parking spot in the lot on this visit.   So it was not the hard-to-find location that was the problem with the previous tenants...  Tony was our server, and he was excellent.  Very personable and helpful.  We started with the scallops, which were flavorful and good sized.  My wife enjoyed her chicken entree, and my lobster risotto, though it appeared small in size at first, was actually very filling and well prepared.  They had a pretty good selection of drinks, and we also liked the bread that accompanied our appetizers.     Nice ambiance, great makeover to the space, friendly service, and good food.  We'll be back!",

We definitely were pleased with all three dishes, in fact I demolished the pizza within 5 minutes. We really enjoyed the pasta, which definitely tasted homemade but I cannot confirm nor deny that. Finally the cheese and meat board was very tasty, but I thought was a tad over priced for the small portions. Regardless it was very pleasant and I would definitely eat at EVO again.   The design of the restaurant was very unique as well. One large skylight and glass wall made the atmosphere very inviting.",

He made us feel completely at home and made great recommendations and tips on the best way to order. Our cocktails were awesome and the food was all fantastic.

Ordered a pizza appetizer but were told the pizza oven was broken AND the kitchen was behind due to a large group. Our server was wonderful and helpful but the food here was simply bad. Our pasta entrees were  simultaneously overcooked and underdone, tasted like they had been sitting out for some time, were barely warm and other than the fennel sausage pasta, borderline inedible. Maybe it was just a bad night for the kitchen but there is absolutely no excuse for the vile condition of the ladies room. It was dirty and smelled strongly of urine, was out of toilet paper and there was only one hand towel left.",

But after we dove in she found a piece of wrapping paper from the cheese packaging, and one of the cured meats was obviously sliced without taking the casing off. I am a prep cook and slice cured meats for charcuterie on the daily. Not to mention a lack of attention from our server. Whom we could see across the bar talking with what seemed to be his friend. Heard the same song literally 3 times within an hour. And why am I yelling at the person across the table from me? I like to talk over dinner and/or  a drink and that was not possible without leaning over the table.  Needless to say I will not be returning.",

It was freeze dried like chip textured and really tasty. For dinner we had lobster risotto (tasty and risotto cooked just right), the black squid ink pasta w/ seafood. Very good  and their fennel sausage pasta. (Spicy side). All their pastas are homemade and cooked al dente just the way I like it.   There were so many restaurants to try and we wanted to have Italian for our last night. We are glad we tried it here.    Please give this awesome strong Yay place a try you will not regret it.",

You couldn't see the pasta layers because the sauce was oozing out everywhere it looked like a bowl of sloppy joes. The Chicken Fettuccine looked nice but was VERY bland. My friend had to ask for cheese and added a lot to try to give it some flavor,  but it didn't work.  The 3rd dish was Heirloom Tomato pasta. The texture of the homemade pasta  was perfect but the flavor was very bad, bland! I would NEVER recommend or go there again.",

    "text": "Went here for Valentines dinner and was so disappointed. My boyfriend and I had a reservation and got there around 15 minutes early to be safe. When we were seated, the tables were literally less than a foot away from each other. We could hear everything the other couples around us were saying vice versa... so we politely asked if we could be moved to a table that was open (mind you there was about 5 tables around us that were). Anyways the hostess, Tahlia, told my boyfriend no we have reservations that will be sitting there so my next thought was okay well we made a reservation too and are paying the same set amount why couldn't we have been put there since we were first. My other thought was okay it's a 4 top and there's only 2 of us so maybe she'll sit a bigger party there BUT NO she sat 2 people there 20 minutes after we asked. So this started the dinner with just a bad vibe because the table was horrible with no privacy. Next our server introduces himself and he was okay but seemed like he didn't know much about what they served. I most likely won't ever come back because of this experience nor will I/do I recommend this place.",

    "text": "I will preface this review by disclaiming I had a pretty rough day and had not eaten more than 1/3 of a small muffin and a handful of nuts all day. And I've waited 3 days to temper my anger to write anything at all... I made reservation on Open Table the day before to celebrate my daughter's 13th birthday. I used open table and answered all the questions and commented that we would be there for a birthday celebration. Our reservation was for 4:15, as we also had plans to catch a 6:15 movie. Figuring 2 hours would suffice in time. Upon arrival the hostess had answered the phone as we approached the desk and proceeded to type up all of their information for a reservation. The manager, whose name I found out from another wait staff is Donny,  was not far away but never greeted, or smiled our way. He saw she was on the phone a perfect opportunity for him to welcome us and perhaps seat us. I waited patiently as the hostess finished her call. She asked if we had a reservation I told her yes. She then proceeded to ask me all the questions which I previously answered on Open Table, which they refer you to use in their recorded message when calling.  They were NOT ready for us at all, she had to put a table together. There was one other larger party and maybe a two top and a few people sitting at the bar. They were NOT busy.  Our waiter who also seemed to be serving the larger party was nice enough, however I think new to the industry. I do have grace for restaurant workers as I once was in their position. I appreciate good service above good food.  We ordered drinks after a few minutes and an appetizer as I jokingly told our waiter whose name I totally forget, I was starving.  My martini came out dirty, super dirty. I asked for extra olives he interpreted that to be dirty.  My mother in law ordered a simple ice tea and that took 20 minutes to get out.  After sitting at the table for 40 min with only drinks on our table I asked if we could please get some bread as I again told him I was starving.  No apps which sounded good never arrived and we didn't get our eventually ordered entrees until more than an hour passed. During this whole time I watched the manager walk from the bar, passed our table to the kitchen no less than 20 times. NEVER did he check our table, much less make eye contact. The only time he came over was to remove dishes after we ate. At this time I used the opportunity to express my disappointment in his management. I understood that our server was busy but as a MANAGER he should have helped him out being so far in the weeds.  Again, we are here for my daughter's birthday. She ordered the gelato for dessert which was brought out and slapped down in front of her by another server. No acknowledgement regarding our occasion.  Not only was my incorrect martini still on the bill AFTER speaking with the manager so was the supposed free gelato that our waiter did tell us would be on them since the appetizers never were even entered into the system. We are foodies. But more so we appreciate good service. This was such horrible service. My mother loved her dish but sad for those chef's we will never be back and I would like to discourage you from going as well.  There are far too many restaurants in this area to endure such indifference.  Heck Applebee's would've been better.  DO NOT GO!!! Save yourself. Head over to Olive & Ivy or Culinary Dropout for better service and decent food.",

    "text": "Okay EVO, I've been here enough times to speak my mind:   Pros: - I love the fact that you're open til late (after my Chem lab class the only thing I want is pasta!!)  - The Mushroom risotto is divine! I ordered it twice and both times was delicious!! The Bolognese is really good as well. - nice location with a parking lot (thumb up in Oldtown)   Cons:  - sorry to say, but your service is nothing impressive...only because I don't drink, I still deserve the same \"friendly\" personality that you show with other customers. - two of your dishes are heavily salty: gnocchi and cauliflowers side...when I expressed my disappointment, no action was taken nor it was taken off from my bill. (This happened at least twice). I also tried the Amatriciana and it had the opposite problem: too insipid. Of course when you asked me how the food was I told you the truth, but it seemed to me no matter what I tell no solution is provided. Well then that's no point of asking me how the food is!  - the Caesar salad has too much garlic, it's overpowering!  - you charge for the bread???? NO WAY! I ordered it once assuming it was included, the waiter didn't mention anything about an extra charge, and I still had to wait 10 minutes for a piece of toasted bread to go with my pasta. - check out other restaurants EVO! No one charges you for a piece of ordinary bread!   I was once very impressed with the Bavette. It's a pasta with a special kind of garlic and olive oil sauce (I guess) but then it was taken off the menu. I asked once if they could make it and they did. But then they told me it wasn't available anymore because they didn't have the ingredients. Too bad. For the Bavette, I would had come back more often, giving 5 stars only for that!   So in the end, I'm not only disappointment for some of your dishes, but also for the way you treat an (almost) regular customer.   Maybe I'll start to tip a little less, and you'll understand what I mean.",

We ordered several happy hour cocktails and apps - the polpette and arancini. The polpette - meatballs were singularly the best appetizer we've ever had. Three nice sized meatballs with a concentrated marinara sauce, a balsamic reduction and toasted bread were the perfect combination. The only thing needed is one more piece of bread to soak up all the sauce - two won't cut it with three meatballs!  The arancini were delicious too however the center did not get hot enough upon the final fry before service so the centers were still cool upon receipt at the table.   The focaccia with ricotta and honey was crispy and soft. All it needed was some black pepper to make it perfect!  The orrechietti with sausage was quite spicy to the point of seeming salty but very, very flavorful and delicious.  We did not stay for the brown butter cake and hope to soon!",

Seemed in a rush which diminished the relaxed atmosphere a bit. The first course we all ordered was the EVO Salad- I have to say, it was EXCELLENT and we all loved it. I would have been happy to just order a larger portion of that as the main course of Espresso Crusted Bistro Steak was disappointing. Mine was pretty fatty and I didn't taste any crust. The roasted potatoes and sauce on the steak was flavorful, but I ended up picking at the steak. For our last course, we requested the Flourless Chocolate Torte, which actually we saw online but it wasn't on the printed menu at the restaurant. So we had to ask our waiter and he had to get the chef to approve it. Strange that they forgot to offer that and thankful we remembered what we saw online. It was good, not great, but good. One of our friends also ordered the Budino dessert, which again differed from the online menu, and it was just ok.  Consensus of the group- we all said we wouldn't go back. It was mediocre at best. Too bad. Only positive was the EVO salad, which might tempt me to return. Just maybe.",

The top had small wording that wrote, \"happy birthday Mallory and thank you for celebrating your birthday with Evo\". I've never seen any place do this before so my friends all loved it. We scrolled over the menu and I found the Evo salad. A couple of us ordered it. We continued sipping on our wine and chatting and after a while realized that it had been near 30 minutes with no food arriving. We mentioned it to our server who went into the kitchen and I watched him go back towards the bar and put the order in. He came back with shots of fireball as an apology. We were okay with it all since we got free booze out of it. Our server was very kind throughout this and even fanned my friends because they complained of the warm temperature in the dining room.  Our food finally arrived and then we saw our salads.  The Evo salad was cooked/toasted leaves with goat cheese. The salad was no good. We were actually laughing at how the salad resembled eating fall leaves or the stuff that flies up from a campfire. I stopped even trying to eat it. It was funny but all in all- I won't return. The food was the main reason for my disappointment.",

Our server was also excellent, and the decor is trendy and cool. We did the Yelp check-in for $.01 Fireball shots, and I also had a grapefruit basil cocktail which was really good and unique. We started with the arancini, which was so perfect. The sauce was unbelievable. We then shared a margherita pizza, which was just okay. But we also shared the pappardelle and that was fantastic. My only complaint was that the serving size seemed really small, especially for $18. But other than that, this place was great!",

They have an amazing drink and wine list as well. The menu has plenty of variety and something for everyone but not so many choices you don't know what to do with yourself. EVO takes traditional Italian inspired favorites and ads a different culinary twist! It is a perfect date spot as no matter where you sit it feels cozy. The resturaunt can be full but in your oversize booth you feel like the only people there! It's location makes it great for groups as well for dinner before a night out, or a late night bite. I highly recommend you check out EVO next time you are in old town Scottsdale, you won't be disappointed!",

He was very nice and explained that he really wanted to make sure the pizza was perfect and that he was going to tell the chef.  When ordering the dessert, I was not sure what to order. So I chose one thing (crepes I think), and the waitress brought us the Italian mini doughnuts anyways after i had finished the crepes. The Italian mini doughnuts were so delicious!! The waitress was very helpful, informative, and adorable.  I would definitely go back!",

    "text": "We live in Scottsdale and eat here quite regularly. The food is NOT of your normal mainstream Italian restaurant staples, like their popular Chili Shrimp , VERY juicy Roasted Chicken breast and a MUST try Evo Salad, the quality is consistently great, so whatever the Chef and kitchen staff are doing keep it up things will only get better! The Scottsdale property is a attractive property in the middle of Old Town, On the corner of 5th ave and Goldwater. The tables are packed in quite a bit, so the place is quite noisy when it's busy. It is therefore better for family and group meals and a quick meal out with the other half but for that you MUST sit at the bar where the bartender Brandon will take great care of you and will even know your name for the next time you come in, as for Nick, I believe his name to be, Owner and Operater will come up and see how you are doing and how was the meal, so for him to take time out of his day to check on his guests really tells a lot of someones place. That's the kinda place I want to spend my money. The hosts' always have a great smile on their face, all servers are all unique in their own little ways, our server was Nick, he was very attentive and paid attention to detail. The service is good on the whole and the staff are helpful when you turn up with small children although being quite crowded, there's not much space for buggies etc, so try and leave them in the car. They do run out of high chairs fairly often, although I think you can reserve them when you make a reservation. I don't think they really have a kids menu but what I have seen, kids portions are quite big. Overall, its the place we eat out at most often as a family.  We will be coming back to Evo to spend our money.",

We also ordered dessert, flourless chocolate cake and brown butter pecan ice cream. Both were delicious. I highly recommend this place and will come back again. We also loved that owner, Nick stopped at our table to ask about our experience and appreciated our feedback.",

    "text": "I went here on a double date this past Saturday night. I had called earlier in the day and made a reservation for 4 people at 6 pm. When we got there they had us down for 3 people at 7 pm. Whatever, no big deal, it was basically empty anyways! We loved the atmosphere, the booths were comfortable, and the decor was modern and interesting. Our server was super cute, knowledgable, and friendly but a bit over bearing. She'd ask if we were ready to order, we asked for more time, and she would literally circle the restaurant, come right back and ask again. Drinks took f-o-r-e-v-e-r and one time the wrong drink was brought BUT, they were all delish! We started with the bruschetta and some risotto balls. Bruschetta was mediocre, but the risotto balls were really tasty. My husband and I split the funghi pizza and the chili shrimp pasta for dinner. Both were OK. The pasta itself in the chili shrimp pasta was really good, really tasted like it was homemade and it was cooked perfectly. It wasn't very spicy though (which surprised me as other reviews said to watch out for the spice!). The funghi pizza was really a disappointment but maybe I'm not being fair as I recently had the funghi pizza at the Parlor and it was amazing! For dessert we tried the chocolate torte - tasted like a chocolate mousse, good but not amazing. The Zeppolini - undercooked! When we bit into it it turned to mush. And we were a table full of Italians who have had some good italian donuts so this was a disappointment. And we tried the gelato as well - just tasted like vanilla ice cream. SO, overall, \"meh. I've experienced better\". I think this place has potential, most of what we ate was on the cusp of being memorable but, unfortunately, was just not there yet. Would I go back? Sure, if there was an event of something already planned there I wouldn't be upset about going back, but we won't be going back voluntarily.",

All the servers and staff were extremely friendly, service was spot on (thanks Sara!) and timing was great with everything. We had the risotto balls, mushroom pizza and meatballs - all were tasty. Great happy hour deals on food and drinks. The restaurant itself is super cute and aesthetically pleasing - patio and interior are both awesome. My only negative was the music was extremely loud - especially for a Thursday night before 8:00 pm. It was a nice intimate atmosphere before then, but we jumped ship when we had to shout across the table for a dinner conversation. Honestly - the guy playing was really good, just too loud for the time and place. I will be back again for sure!",

    "text": "Finally returned to celebrate my friend's birthday.  We got some restaurant menu items which included the EVO salad which seemed popular based on reviews.  It had a few fried kale leaves, pancetta, cheese and some brussel sprouts, etc.  I thought it was promising but not especially great.  I actually don't like the fried leaves as it didn't do anything for the salad and just tasted bitter.  The steak was very bland so I requested salt (there are no shakers on the tables!).  The potatoes were seasoned and fried well, but somehow they missed the steak?  I even tried eating the potatoes and the fried onions with the steak but it was still too bland.  The sauce it was on didn't do much at all to help, it really didn't have a strong flavor of anything..  I also tried the sole which was a step up from fish sticks.  The pasta was actually decent - like a better version of chef boyardee.  The noodles may actually be freshly made as they had a decent texture to it.  If the sauce was better I would have tried coming back for pasta later.  They ran out of Nutella for dessert so we got chocolate torte instead.  It's pretty rare for me to throw away a chocolate torte but that's basically what I did...  it tasted very odd and dry.  Thankfully we had a birthday cake alternative.  I really don't think I'll be back anytime soon.",

    "text": "The ambiance was nice.  The staff was friendly.  The Ceasar salad was very good.   But I'm almost at a loss for words about the \"Italian\" cuisine.  It's hard for me to believe that any chef, or cook, would serve some of this food and think it's edible, much less good.   When my wife put the pappardelle bolognese in her mouth, after fiddling with the thick pasta in an attempt to get it on her fork, she actually stopped chewing and just stared at me. I asked her if it was good.  Silence.  Then, I said \"mediocre?\"  More silence.  Then she spit it into her napkin and finally said, \"taste this, it's tastes like glue.\" And unfortunately, I did taste it, and I had the same reaction, and I had to spit it out.  The homemade pasta was so thick it couldn't be twirled onto the fork, it had to actually be cut with a knife.  And it tasted like uncooked dough with flour on it.  There was no meat to be found in the dish and the sauce looked and tasted like it just came out of a tomato can, watery with the tinny taste of the can.   That's why I wrote that I'm almost at a loss for words because I've never tasted anything like it.  It's not possible that the person who cooked it tastes their own food or has any experience with preparing or eating Italian food.   I ordered the calamari steak with \"arreganata.\"  Again, pretty shocking.  The calamari steak had no flavor at all and the \"arreganata' was some soggy bread crumbs piled on top that were so over salted, one bite was too much.  We returned both the appetizer and entree.   Then, as a last ditch effort to eat something other than salad, we ordered the meatball appetizer which unfortunately was equally as confusing.  The meatballs were flavorless and wet, and the sauce they were sitting in tasted exactly like ketchup and worcestershire steak sauce.   We took the meatballs to go and then threw them away.   I'm not trying to be overly critical or mean, but it's hard to describe what we were served.   I can tell you that after we left, we felt like we had to get something to wash the taste out of our mouths.   Sorry Evo, but I strongly suggest you bring in a chef to taste your food before serving more of it.",

They had a number of larger parties there which according to Joy, contributed to the problem, but seriously - if you're running a relative hot spot in Scottsdale on a Saturday night, you should be able to handle that.   Bottom line - food was great but management has a LOT of work to do. The Evo I saw last night was not ready for prime time.",

The HH beers are 3 bucks each and they have some food specials. We got a pizza, but it was hardly edible as all I tasted was alot of salt. It looked like maybe some other choices might be good, but HH ended and we had to leave. Not budget friendly unless your at happy hour which again is why it was packed between 4 and 7pm and empty at 7:01pm.",

Both were amazing but the sausage fennel pasta was almost exactly what I had in NY. So good. Server was a super young kid and brand new but he was friendly and was still very good   And they serve full menu until 1230 am.  Big plus.",

    "text": "After attending a Yelp brunch event at EVO last month, I wanted to come back and try dinner here. We decided to host my husbands boss and his wife here and that also would give us the chance to come back. We decided to arrive early and try the happy hour before the boss arrived. I love the setting and decor of EVO, which is dimly lit, lots of candles, music just the right volume and not blasting your eardrums off, and the exposed wood and brick mixed with red textiles give it a chic, classy feel. The bathrooms are clean; a lot can be said about the cleanliness of a restaurant depending on the cleanliness of the restroom.  EVO's bar has a great happy hour menu. Happy Hour runs from 4-7pm. I like to take notice of happy hours that are worthy! I will have to put this on my Yelp happy hour list! Wait for that! The EVO Happy Hour has really mouthwatering starters that are by NO means small in portion, at least for what we ordered. We started with the Bruschetta of the Day, which is a daily chef inspired bruschetta, (thats fun!) made of ricotta, a little honey, and apricot, topped upon perfectly toasted housemade bread. The boss arrived and he and his wife ordered the Arancini, which was three large balls made of risotto with red sauce over them. Seriously, you could make this a side with a pasta for a meal! There was also an Italian Sweet Corn that was ordered. When it arrived there were four small ears of corn with the perfect spices and oil drizzled over the warm ears. I can not eat corn but it smelled heavenly! On the Happy Hour menu, $3 drafts and bottled beers; $4 well drinks; $5 tap wine, (which I have always turned my nose to, but since my husband ordered a Pinot off the tap, I tried it and stopped my snootiness there!) and $7 specialty cocktails. That is ANY specialty cocktail off the menu. The other thing that not all places do during happy hour is allow you to order off the happy hour menu at the table, but when we moved with the boss and his wife to our reserved table from the bar, the waiter greeted us and told us that the happy hour was still going and we could have that at the table. Nice!  Dinner time! I had a glass of cava to start and to finish our appetizers off with. I like the wine menu being so expansive and with at least a few bubbly's that you can order by the glass, since I am selfishly, a bubbly girl but can not do a whole bottle by myself. (Okay. I can. But I should not).The waiter was on point and made suggestions to us based on our tastes and his own personal favorites and the 'why' he liked them, as well. It was hard to decide. I would not say that this menu, being Italian, is what I would call, 'Old School Italian', such as lasagna or alfredo sauced fettuccines, which are not on this menu, but I liked it! The menu does not overwhelm you with choices. There is a fish of the day and a beef. Both sound amazing! Maybe next time! I came for pasta! I had the Squid Ink Chittara. The squid ink may throw some off but let me say this, its mainly for aesthetic purpose. In other words, you do not taste squid. This dish was something so different for me but considering myself a 'foodie', I had to try it! Long, thin dark purple squid ink noodles are tossed with a uni butter and chile for a little spicy kick, then topped with lumps of white crab, a little scallion and a little breadcrumb and a few sauteed cherry plum tomatoes. It was a perfect portion for me. My one small complaint, I would have liked to have seen more lump crab. It was a small, small portion and I would be willing to pay more to see even 1/4 cup of it. I know its a rough season for crab in California, so maybe that is it. No matter. I loved this dish! Its different and today i wanted more, but I had no leftovers! My husbands dish was the Pappardelle that had a red ragu sauce with lots of beef, veal and pork, just like a good ragu sauce should have. I loved his too! One nice touch would be for the waiter to bring fresh parmesan and have large spoons served with the bowls of pasta for twisting the pasta.  You can get bread to go with all this pasta too, on the menu as Noble Bread Service. NOT that we needed any more yummy-ness!  Dessert! My husband can not seem to try a new restaurant with out sharing a dessert. EVO has an amazing 'hard to choose just one', dessert menu! He ordered the Warm Butter Cake. I am not sure if that is the correct name, but the long and short of it is that it is a ample serving of a warm, dense butter cake served atop a creme anglaise and topped with whipped cream. It's warm, rich, sinful and heavenly all at once. Today we are officially juicing after this amazing meal at EVO.  I am glad we had a reason to come back for dinner. I love the area of town that EVO is in, as it is a good starting point for a weekend night in Old Town and even a good ending point with its great bar and drinks. I am officially a fan!",

The staff was friendly, the place had a steady flow of guests and the ambiance was on point. We had the bruschetta board, the chicken picanta, and the baby butter cake. Due to a slight mix up in the kitchen with our dessert the MOD sent out a second dessert, their chocolate cakes, and comped out desserts. Katelyn, our server, was super nice and present when we needed her to be but not overbearing. Awesome experience around!",

It may have been one of the most delicious things I've ever eaten. And we also split the lasagna which was just OOOOOZING with cheese. I was a very happy girl.

We ordered the bruschetta trio and the meatballs. I didn't eat much of it but my husband liked the eggplant and the fig. I wouldn't order it again. We both didn't like the traditional. He mentioned the meatballs were good but he wasn't as enthusiastic as I thought he would be. For our entrees I ordered the Heirloom Tomato Pasta. The pasta was very good. Cooked perfectly. The sauce was good. I did push a lot of garlic to the side. My hubby had more meat. He really enjoyed the Fennel Sausage Pasta. It's a 40 minute drive for us I doubt we would return. At the end of our meal a large gnat was in my wine. Not a big deal it happens but I was hoping the server would come back so I could ask for a clean glass and a smidge of wine but I had already paid the bill. Speaking of the bill, we thought the price for 3 glasses of wine 2 happy hour apps and 2 entrees was very reasonable.  I received an email from Open Table saying we were a no show. WTH!!!",

Mastros butter cake is better. I suppose that's what I get for being spoiled!! It was underdone in the middle and I asked for ice cream instead of whip cream. The outer crusts with vanilla ice cream wasn't bad.  Unbelievable. Prosciutto pizza and they bring out cheese with arugula on it. The manager even double checked the order.",

They were amazing and our waiter told us that the chef spent months perfecting the flavours. I'm not sure what types of meats were in the meatballs but they were super tender and practically melts in your mouth.   For my entree I had the chilli shrimp .. very tasty, had pasta, sauteed shrimp, chilli, a mint flavour and had a nice spice flavour at the end of each bite. Very flavourful.  For dessert I had the brown butter baby cake which you have to order 20 minutes ahead of time. It's very tasty and sounds exactly what it is, a small cake and I assume they use butter and mix it in with the cake with whip cream on the side and powdered sugar with raspberries on top. I love the crunch on top of the cake and how soft it is inside.   Overall all it's really good... average price is 25 a person",

It didn't help that we were seated right next to the open kitchen so we constantly heard the clanging of dishes. They really should install some sound insulation here. It would improve the dining experience so much!  Food was also just okay to me. I got the calamari appetizer and the EVO salad. The calamari was not fried, which was a surprise but I still enjoyed it. The EVO salad was not great. The charred kale and Brussels sprouts were interesting, but the kale was literally like eating dry kale chips and I just was not into it for an entire bowl of it. I was searching for the Brussels sprout pieces bc those weren't as dry, but they were few and far between. The balsamic dressing on it was a touch too sour for my liking and I was cringing at the sourness in some of my bites. I liked the pine nuts and other bits that were mixed into the salad.   Based on the food I *might* come again but based on the ambience it's a no for me bc I prefer restaurants where I can easily talk to my dining companions.",

We were greeted with a smile and seated at a booth per our request. Chloe was our server and she was really great and very smiley which I appreciate. We started with the mussel cioppino app she suggested which was fantastic, great flavor that keeps you dipping your bread in the sauce. We decided to share two dishes and chose the Lobster carbonara with gnocchi and the Lasagna which is served in it's own skillet, great presentation and bonus, it keeps the dish nice and hot. Both were really great. Being a seafood lover, the Lobster was my favorite and a don't miss in my book.  Even after all that Chloe enticed us to splurge on dessert. We shared the Brown Butter Babycake! OMG! This was so good, served with a creme anglaise and fresh raspberries. You need to allow 25 minutes for this but Chloe checked on us at the perfect time to order it so there was no need to worry. During our dinner the manager stopped by to make sure we were enjoying everything as well. This was a really nice night and we had a great time and left stuffed. We'll be back for sure!",

It seemed strange that they were out of the Chicken Milanese given the relatively simple ingredients, but I found something else to order.  After ordering, another couple was seated at the table next to us.  We were almost done with our meals when the table next to us was served.  One of the people next to us was served the Chicken Milanese.  At this point I was frustrated since that is what I had wanted and tried to order.  The food we did end up having was pretty good and would otherwise deserve a 4 star review, but this left a bad taste in my mouth that the waiter told me the restaurant was out of the dish when they clearly weren't.  When we got the bill, they provide the recommended tip amounts which is pretty standard.  However, they base these amounts on the after tax amount.  I get that this is a minor point (typically only a couple dollars difference), but the tip amount should be shown pre-tax.  Once we got home, I had an email from open table (we booked the reservation on open table) stating that we missed the reservation.  While not a big deal, just an annoyance to have to fix that with open table.",

Appetizers were good. I had panzanella salad and hubby had grilled octopus. We both liked our dishes.  Hubby had the chili shrimp pasta for his entree and I had the cace de pepe (sp?). I was worried about the egg yolk because I'm usually not a fan but that ended up being the least of my worries. I have never had this pasta before but saw it on a cooking show so I knew it was supposed to have lots of black pepper. But this was ridiculous. And we were super excited to have fresh pasta. But both our pastas were dry and tough. Husband's shrimp was overcooked. I asked for extra parmesan and the server acknowledged that the pasta was dry and she would tell the chef. ???? She brought extra parmesan but our dishes were still only half eaten. She didn't ask if anything was wrong.   Desserts were okay. Brown butter cake was actually very good but the bottom was burnt. Our other dessert was some sort of custard which I didn't really care for.  Cocktails were tasty but weak.  As you can see on my other reviews I rarely leave bad reviews. But for a restaurant of this caliber and price point, this is unacceptable. We weren't looking for free food or anything but an acknowledgment and apology would have been great at the very least especially when she knows the food wasn't good. An offer to replace our dishes with something else would have been better.   We won't be back.",

    "text": "Awesome food AND service!  The vibe is intimate and somewhat romantic, but still low key. The pastas were super fresh and homemade.  I got the squid ink seafood pasta and it was to die for! So flavorful, with a generous serving of large fresh shrimp and calamari. The dish had a tinge of spice, but not too much (i'm not big on spiciness)! I was really impressed. I also was one of those annoying customers who decided to try to change my order after it was already put in... and the entire staff was unbelievably nice and accommodating about it!! They made sure I got what I wanted. Even the bread here was amazing - it was served with a pesto-style sauce and goat cheese. Yum. The table next to us ordered an amazing looking lobster carbonara dish and looked pretty pleased with their meals. Overall, a great place. I still regret not tipping way more than 20%, because they were so accommodating.  Will definitely be back.",

They have a good atmosphere with an easy going crowd and very laid back casual luxury feel. They have great happy hour and specials. All the staff there as well as management seems to be very on point as well as timely/fair with their customers. In my opinion this is a successful business but if it were closer to Scottsdale Road they would have a lot more customers. Also, if you like late night food they are literally one of the only non fast food restaurants within literally miles besides The W room service that can offer that to my knowledge. Give this place a shot if you want to try a new happy hour or dinner",

    "text": "I heard about Evo from a local PBS food show and was immediately incensed by the thought of a grilled lobster tail served with gnocchi in a carbonara sauce.  It was an interesting experience but maybe didn't quite live up to expectations.   Evo is located in a sweetly cute little building in Old Town Scottsdale. We made reservations same-day for late evening and were seated as soon as we arrived (and 15 minutes early) so we were off to a great start, but then we sat for 15 minutes before anyone approached our table. Throughout the night the service was just iffy - minimal attention although we weren't ignored. I might as well get the other two big issues out too:  the acoustics were AWFUL - it was incredibly loud and you could only hold a conversation if you talked/yelled. It was about 2/3 full when we were there and it's hard to imagine it being louder. The other issue was that we were seated nearer the kitchen and the ventilation system needs some work. At times smoke billowed like clouds into the dining room so heavily that waitstaff waved their hands in front of their faces.   So let's talk about the food. Good - overall not great. We started with two appetizers - either on their own strong but not so good together. I wish the waitress had provided a little guidance.  We ordered the Focaccia Rustica - a thin bread layered with marcapone and Brie and drizzled with honey. It was a big serving, very tasty but pretty fatty and rich.  All of that was good but the second appetizer was the Raviolo - a big ricotta stuffed ravioli served in a bowl swimming in brown butter and topped with pancetta. Also very good, very fatty, and very rich. The two together were just too much but either on its own would be good - and between the two the focaccia was excellent!  Hubby had a Caesar Salad - very bland and boring with no skill put into it - tasted like a bagged salad.   For entrees the three of us each tried something different. Hubby had lasagna and he thought it was just ok.  BF had the Fettuccine Alfredo with shrimp - he said it was pretty tasty. I had the lobster tail with gnocchi. I really liked the lobster but the gnocchi were pan-fried maybe a bit too long and they were tough not pillowy or tender. All three dishes were served warm not hot. Overall just ok.   We skipped dessert and headed to Creamistry instead.   It's hard to rate a meal like this - there were high and low points but mostly just middle of the road points. They were actually more of a 3.5. Maybe a quieter night of the week would be better?",

If you are in the mood for good food, but later in the evening, EVO is open until 2 AM! It was pretty quiet at this time but we assumed it was because a) It was past the normal dinner time and b) everyone ditches Scottsdale when our temps are 110+ degrees.   I ordered their Coppola Pinot Grigio on tap to start and it was refreshing and just what I had been craving. To start, we split their Focaccia Rustica which was filled with brie, mascarpone, sea salt, and local honey. Holy heaven, this was AMAZING. I usually don't love 'sweet' dishes for dinner but seriously, this was the perfect combo of sweet and savory. Next, we split the EVO salad and i've been craving it ever since! It was filled with crispy brussels sprouts, kale, chevre, pear, pancetta, pine nuts, and balsamic. Seriously, you MUST get this if you choose to dine at EVO.   For my entree, I went simple and had their bolognese. That too, was incredible!   To cleanse our palates, we finished our meal with homemade limoncello (their Check-In offer on Yelp)! It was the perfect ending to a great dining experience. We'll absolutely be back!",

    "text": "Happy Hour from 4-7 pm. We came here because my son wanted bolognes even. I looked up pasta on Yelp and EVO Had some nice reviews. We got their half hour before Happy Hour was done.  Nice restaurant decor and ambiance. With my checkin, they treated me to a shot of limoncello cordial. Then we ordered.  EVO burger was a big and juicy burger with roasted tomatoes and perfectly seasoned. It came with truffle fries, which are to die for ($10).  Truffle fries were crisp and accented with shaved Parmesan and topped with a splash of truffle salt and truffle salt ($5?).  Pasta bolognese a 3 star experience in my opinion. The sauce was bland compare to the big flavor of the burger and the truffle fries.  The wood-fired pizza oven yielded a nice mushroom pizza.   I learned a valuable lesson today. When I go to a restaurant, I should probably announce to my wait staff that I am allergic to walnuts, cashews and almonds. When I asked our serve what was on the bruschetta, she didn't realize that I had allergy concerns. She listed, \"goat cheese, fig jam and onions, and did not mention almonds, so I thought it was a go!\" When it arrived it looked pretty, but when I bit into it, I could feel the almonds, and thus, had to take Benadryl. When she checked on us next, I explained that I didn't realize the bruschetta had almonds, she returned it and asked if we wanted something else. We got an extra order of truffle fries, which we proceeded to polish off.  We enjoyed our meal thorough albeit the almonds, With the great happy hour prices, the four of us left filled and satisfied for the grand price of $11 per person including tip.",

    "text": "Date night for the wife and I on a Friday evening.  We like to patron the non-chain restaurants.   We arrived at 7:00 on a Friday night,  moderately busy.  Small little restaurant so the noise level is a little high but simmered down after happy hour at approx 7:30. The hostess that sat us was very friendly and engaging. we like that.  Remember restaurants, the hostess is the first person representing your establishment.   Upon or seating we greeted by our waitress. she kind of seemed disconnected.  We started with the Steak Bruschetta as an appetizer.  The shaved meat was excellent nice and tender, good flavors.  As for dinner...  My wife ordered a Lobster Carbonara which was excellent. The mixtures of the gnocchi and pancetta were excellent mixed with the seafood flavors.  I ordered the Squid Ink Chitarra.  The presentation was good. Took a twist of the squid ink pasta and the flavors of the slightly spicy sauce and cheeses were incredible. However...... When I shelled my first Mussel I noticed a funky smell.  It had the smell of a dirty aquarium.  this was not isolated to one mussel all the mussels had the same smell.  Took a few minutes to garner the attention of the waitress and was returned,  she advised that I would get a new bowl without the mussels and extra shrimp.  I received a new bowl of my dish approximately 10 minutes later. while I was eating my dish one of the other waitresses bumped into my table while serving another table close by. she bumped it pretty hard disrupting our meal, no acknowledgment or apology. Kind of hard to enjoy your food after the fact.  We did order the brown butter baby cake which does take about 25 minutes to prepare.  this was quite good.    In the end, the food was good,  no acknowledgment from management or comped in any way for the bad dish, which kind of put a damper on things. I just wanted to enjoy the evening with my wife, so I didn't raise a stink.  I will not be back nor recommend",

The hostess made it quite clear that \"there just wasn't' anything available.\"  The demeanor was very exclusive and unfriendly.  Our family has dinner out every Friday and enjoy the social aspects of dinner in the town.  Unfortunately we could not get past the door.  We ended up eating at Tarbell's which was fantastic!  Food is 1/2 the experience she failed miserably at the other 1/2.  I strongly do not recommend EVO",

    "text": "Must say I was disappointed by this restaurant. We went there as part of a tour. As I sit at my table I can see into the kitchen where no one is wearing a hairnet (one guy had a napkin tied around his head and one woman had sunglasses sitting on her head, but not sure those count) and the staff standing in the wait station section look completely miserable.   The house charred salad was burnt...nothing like the taste of burned brussel sprouts to ruin your dining experience (still burping those up-yummy). I understand that they pre-made it for the big group, but don't burn it. The appetizer sized pasta we had was completely overcooked so when you tried to cut it the pasta smooshed and the filling squirted out the sides.  In Scottsdale where there are several hundred eating establishments to choose from, that quality is not going to get you very far. If you don't want to do the your pricing, then don't, but if you agree to it make sure your food is up to standard.",

I don't think the servers are that attentive or helpful from the hostess to the bartender- but since it is only happy hour I guess I am still happy with it? But how great would it be if they really cared I was there!!. The bartender did not know what the cocktail of the day was going to be and that was after it had been open for 45 minutes.   The Evo hamburger is one of the best I have had .  It comes with fries and we split it so we can try something else but it would be a full meal for one.The bruschetta bread board looked amazing. I would not try the arancini balls of risotto again. Nothing special. Check in on yelp and get a free shot of limoncello! Yum!!!",

The service was great, and they took the time to personalize the menus at the table with my name and the occasion, which was an incredible, thoughtful, beautiful touch. (I posted a picture.)  I had the lobster risotto, which was great. Huge chucks of lobster and creamy, perfect risotto.   I love the cocktails here. My idea of a perfect bar is once where you can tell the bartender I like drinks that are [insert whatever description you like], so make something and surprise me. The staff behind the bar at EVO can do just that and hit the nail on the head.   You can't go wrong here, great spot for drinks or dinner or both. And a lovely place to celebrate an event.",

My friend gets her pasta first and at the end her salad.  We ordered some bread with pesto and when we realized it wasn't pesto we asked the guy what happened and he said that they ran out of pesto and so the tried to make a similar sauce ?!  At the end we tried our best to get out of the restaurant to go have an actual dinner somewhere else. The only thing that made this a 1 star and not a 0 star review was the super kind waiter named Tony who tried with unremitting hope to save the night paying for our dessert! It was appreciated by still left the restaurant with the stomach empty.  They need some organization in the kitchen and with food delivery",

It was pretty dead when we came in around 9:30pm (understandable).  We got beer and wine and ordered the bread with pesto and ricotta to start.  It was good, but I am starting to find it troubling how many restaurants are now charging for bread (or chips and salsa at Mexican places).    My fiancee ordered the ravioli and I had the squid-ink pasta.  The first (and only other time) I ever had squid-ink pasta was in the Old Italy district in San Diego, and remains one of the best meals I have ever eaten.  I should have realized that EVO would not compare, but I had high hopes.  I was sorely disappointed.  The pasta was just a slimy mess with a weird sour taste.  The crab was just as bad, tasting very funky.  Everything just tasted like it was cooked in dirty tap water.  My fiancee said her ravioli was good, but the dish is only one ravioli.  My heart sank when the dinners were brought.  I felt so bad that my fiancee's dinner consisted of one ravioli.  She was finished before the server had a chance to come back to ask how everything was tasting.  Then she had to just sit there while I forced down the rest of my dinner.  Oh, and a note to the managers: charging for bread is one thing.  But there is no reason you should be selling PBR for $6.  On a plus side, the service was decent...",

We shared a salad with goat cheese (delicious but almost entirely absent), pecans (actually a few slivers) and a \"honey dressing\" which, when we asked for extra, turned out to be.. well, honey. I then had orecchiette with fennel sausage. The sausage was OK, but the pasta was cooked to a rubbery texture and was drowned in a thin chili sauce. My wife's pappardelle with Bolognese sauce lacked any meaty flavor and was so bland that it  might have come from chef Boyardee. It too sat on pasta so over -cooked that she could not twirl it on her fork. It simply fell to pieces. Given that the prices are on a par with some  of the finer Italian restaurants in Scottsdale, it was terribly disappointing.",

    "text": "Ok, as I said in my last review, I've had very different experiences at EVO. One of the interesting things about them is how frequently their menu changes... which can be good or bad, depending on your tastes. (The things you like are never there for long, but then, there are always new things to try.) This is definitely something they pride themselves on, and it gives them an opportunity to try new things.   On my last trip, I had trouble finding much that didn't feel overly trendy with far-reaching ingredients that just didn't sound appetizing. I tried again yesterday and found the new menu delightful, with a much better mix of standby favorites and adventurous meals. The new menu includes a great steak and a salmon that sounded delicious! Because they were doing a $2 pasta special (what a deal!!! Though understandably one night only) for their 2-yr anniversary, we decided to go with the EVO mainstay (which was fantastic!) and a few glasses of tap wine. (The tap pinot noir was actually really great! I don't know much about tap wines, but I was a fan.) The bruschetta we ordered to start was a pesto caprese that was wonderful - well dressed with great flavor and really set the meal off right. While we didn't try any of the new entrees, we will certainly try to get back before the menu rotates again, because they sounded fantastic!",

Within about 30 minutes there were six other people at the bar and I was invisible.  There were now THREE bartenders...not one made eye contact or checked to see if I wanted another glass of wine despite the fact that my glass was empty.  I left 20% but won't be back or recommend EVO.  It's just a J-O-B and that doesn't work in the restaurant business in this town.",

First, on a Sunday in downtown Scottsdale at 5:30pm, and the restaurant wasn't even a third full (during snowbird season). That should tell you something. My wife and daughter ordered Chicken Picatta with vegetables instead of the pasta. Son-in-law ordered Bolognese and I ordered the Heirloom Tomato pasta with meatballs. When dinner came, my wife's and daughter looked nothing like Chicken Picatta but more like pasta primavera. Both said it wasn't hot. They questioning the dish and we found that it was eggplant instead. Both were taken away. My son-in-law ate his and said it was fine. He was probably just hungry.  Mine, the pasta was stuck together and the meatballs were cold. Not room temperature but refrigerator cold. Yes the three dishes were all remade but we ate at different times. Don't waste your money!  Better restaurants out there.",

    "text": "My experience was similar to Jessica J.  We were a party of 6 and went on a Thursday for 6 p.m. dinner.  The food was fine.  Everyone enjoyed the Evo kale salad.  The Bolognese was great.  If I were to rate the food for the price I would say 4 stars.  But for me the atmosphere is just as important as the food, in fact, I would  prefer just \"ok\" food but great table and service.  We arrived at 6 and they only had a few tables occupied.  Since we were a party of 6 we asked for a round table and the hostess told us they were reserved.  One of the 2 rounds was set with silverware but the second had nothing on it.  I know there are situations were the table is reserved for later and would not have given us time to dine before the other party arrived and I'm fine with that.  We were seated at two tables pushed together making it difficult to have a group conversation.  Both tables sat unseated for the entire time we were there.  It was noisy and there was music in the bar which was fine but if we had been seated at the round table we would have been farther from the bar and it would have been easier to talk.  Our server had no idea what the daily specials were although he was attentive.  Worst part: Thursday night is Manicures and Martinis. The smell from the nail stations that were set up was very noticeable.  Totally not acceptable in a dining environment. I'm not sure what the health dept. would say to serving food while and filing nails.  We had dined the week of Superbowl with another group.  We were seated at the bigger table, the server was very helpful and knew the menu.  No manicure smell.  The noise level was not a problem but they weren't very busy.  Overall a good experience.",

Let me start off by saying I am a huge foodie and eat out way too much, and I have also worked in a restaurant in the past.  Evo was the worst service I have EVER had. I had my father and stepmother in town, and my sister and I had heard great things about Evo so we decided to take them there. It was a Saturday night. We had reservations. We were seated in a booth in the bar section. I have never been to a louder restaurant in my life! And I'm in my 20s, it takes a lot for me to consider something uncomfortably loud. After having been seated at our table for TWENTY minutes, with no one having stopped by to even bring us water, we had to get up and say something to the hostess. She was snappy and rude, saying that someone would be by. Another 5 minutes pass...no one has brought us water. We get up again. She says the same thing. Isn't even apologetic!! Another 5 minutes pass, NO ONE COMES BY. I'm not even exaggerating. We say something A THIRD TIME, and finally a waiter arrives who says he was just informed that we had sat down. And once again, not even apologetic. The service was atrocious. It was unreal. We really should have left at that point. On a lighter but at this point pointless note: The food was very good, Classic Italian dishes with a twist. If the service had been standard, never mind good, I would have gone back. However, the service was awful and I won't be back. I do not recommend this restaurant to anyone. And that's sad.",

The vibes were cool and comfortable and very relaxed!",

    "text": "This may be a great spot for late night dining.  And the reviews are mostly favorable.  But for a fairly early dinner on a Wednesday, I will say I am just not that impressed.  The ambiance was cold, stark and strange.  The waiter was lacking any interest or passion for the job.  The food was so-so in a city that can boast so many outstanding Italian restaurants.  To sum it up, not to happy to have wasted time and money here and won't be back.",
