    "text": "Hip. Romantic. Cool.  I've been to True Foods in SoCal, but coming to this location has been the best experience so far. My date and I came in around 7:30PM during the week and it was filled up pretty nicely. We were greeted at the door by the hostess and she was very sweet and cheerful. We asked to be seated outside and were seated immediately. Only a few minutes go by and we're already being greeted by our server who was so nice and upbeat, and funny! He got us water and asked us if we had ever been there before and recommended some of his faves.  I ordered the Kale & Avocado Dip that has pink grapefruit in it and the Medicine Man Refresher. My date ordered the Seared Tuna Wrap and the Hangover Rx (except he wasn't hungover)(I don't think...). When the server was telling us about the Seared Tuna Wrap, he was going over the Seared Fish and ended up getting his words backwards and called my date Seared... instead of Sir :) So for the rest of the night my date was Seared, instead of Sir. He was fun!  We got our meals out pretty quickly, and everything was so delicious! His (my date's) dish came with Quinoa that wasn't too saucy or over-abundant, it was JUST right. The tuna tasted fresh. I highly recommend trying out the Kale & Avocado dip though, it comes with chips but you can eat this dish with or without them and it's still great! (Although with the chips it makes it that much more wonderful.) The ambiance of the restaurant was very chill and hip, and the patio was a great place to relax and enjoy the weather - well, since it wasn't hot out!  We will return again, healthy fooood!",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place.. The only dish I truly enjoyed was the Avocado/Spinach dip and gluten free pitas. I think our waiter's pretentious attitude ruined the food, and atmosphere. When I asked Andrew about a dish, his response was in an I am much better than you because I am a vegan tone... \"I don't know, because I don't eat that.\" Is really not the response you are looking for, I usually am one to chuck it up to ok maybe he is having a bad day... But It was like everything about him was sour, which I think soured the experience. My friend ordered the spaghetti squash without cheese, and Andrew rolled his eyes... I would of thought he would of clapped, since it now would be vegan... He sulked away...  The food came, and My friends dish tasted of Lighter fluid, when we brought it to Andrew's attention... he just took it away, he was unapologetic, he did not state whether he would get a new one or offer her another option. We watched as he spoke with the manager and pointed at our table... The manager  however was very friendly, and apologetic. He brought the new dish out, which tasted and smelled great.  If only that could of saved the evening from Andrew's attitude. We did not see Andrew again,  another server brought us our check, and took it to process the cards. It was not until it was time to pick up our check, did Andrew Return..  I was over his pretensions hipster attitude at this point. It ruined my evening as well as my chance to enjoy a new place I had once look forward to trying...",

    "text": "I wish more restaurants could be like this. We came here for brunch this weekend and enjoyed everything about this place! The service is top notch, more healthy options than not, VERY reasonable prices, and fresh ingredients. What more could you ask for?  The place was shockingly empty at around 10am Saturday morning, but that just meant faster service for us! We were pretty hungry so opted to split the banana, espresso, pistachio, date muffin. It was the just the right size and oh so delicious. I need to figure out how to make those suckers!  I shared the huevos rancheros and the market vegetable scramble. What a perfect combo! The scramble was chock full of veggies and laid on top of a sweet potato hash (basically some finely diced sweet potatoes that seemed to have been sauteed. The huevos was two sunny side up eggs on top of corn tortillas and served with a side of freshly made salsa. There was a light sprinkling of cheese but just enough to see. The spice from the salsa was not too heavy and worked well with the ranchero sauce. I was surprised not to see a side of beans or something. Regardless, it was really good.  We decided to try a quinoa Johnny cake because the server was telling us how good they were. He wasn't kidding. I wasn't sure what to expect but it was plenty big and I couldn't even tell there was quinoa in it...it tasted just like a pancake! On top was a decent sized dollop of Greek yogurt and a few fresh blueberries.  I left stuffed but not in a food coma like way, like i would have felt eating breakfast out somewhere else. I would definitely return for brunch and can't wait to try lunch or dinner there! This restaurant proves you can eat really good food that's HEALTHY! And you can watch them prepare the food from your table to prove it!",

I had been to the one in Scottsdale and liked it and this one in Phoenix proved to be on par with the other.  My wife and I both had the Tuscan Kale salad with grilled chicken, son had Street Tacos and DIL had Asian Noodles - ALL of the meals were purdy darn good - except my wife's Chicken was a bit dry - mine was nice and juicy, but it came late - a small issue! We also decided to share two deserts among the four of us - a Chi Pudding with Banana and Coconut and a Strawberry and Rhubarb Crisp with Vanilla Ice Cream - ending our trip to True Foods was VERY GOOD!  The restrooms were clean, the rest of the place was showroom and the food that you are going to receive is right our on display. They validate your parking so you get two hours for free.   Credit cards are accepted and you won't be disappointed. We each tried something different and were very happy with our choices - I'd still like to try their pizzas because they looked incredible on their way to other tables. The place was buzzing - a True sign that you were getting True GOOD food!",

    "text": "\"If veggies always tasted like this, I would have eaten all of my veggies as a kid\"  Everything about my experience was pretty fantastic. So let's break it down (1) ambiance - 4/5  (2) service  - 5/5 (3) food - 4/5  Ambiance -  This place is very welcoming and adds to the idea they want to be transparent and emphasize that everything is made with TLC. You can stand at the entrance and see through the whole restaurant. It's nice there are not a lot of obstructions from one table to the next to the kitchen to where the staff was rolling the silverware. The open windows allows the natural light to make this place very open as well. Why the 4.. well... the tables are so close together and it was hard to move and harder for the staff to ask us things or bring us our food without having to navigate the matrix.  Service -  Service was absolutely fantastic. I was there with a large group who did not all arrive at the same time. That did not stop the waiter from asking us did we need anything while we waited and then come back and ask that as our party straggled in. To add to that, I loved how the staff would just jump in and help our server regardless if that was their table or not. It ensured we did not have to wait and that the server could be more effecient and effective. For example, one of the staff persons, walked over and took a ton of menus from our server so that he could focus on us and not menus, holding, not dropping, and us.  Food -  The food was amazing. We started with the Vegetable crudites, Edamame dumpling, dumpling like things and hummus. The vegetable crudites blew me away. If veggies tasted that good ALL the time, I would probably eat more of them more often. I mean it was beautifully presented and extremely fresh. There were veggies on there I might not eat on a regular, but it may have changed by mind.  The other items were just okay. They didn't wow me. For a refresher I had the pomegranate limeade which was quite refreshing!  So the entrees - I had the trout and the kale salad. When I tell you this kale salad was plentiful and absolutely delicious.. I was speechless at how tasty this was. I am going to have to recreate this.. It was so simple but flavorful. The trout was meh.. It was cooked well but so salty that I could only eat half. I guess between the capers and the olives, and the sauce it was a bit overpowering.  I can't wait to get back there! Everyone was super friendly and it's nice that my food is made with TLC.. just like (or pretty close) to how I would make it at home.",

    "text": "We went to True Food on Camelback for lunch. My husband had the asparagusand smoked mozzarella pizza ($11) and I ordered the steak tacos ($14).  While the food was good, it lacked in flavor. I am sure the finest organic ingredients were used but the beans that accompanied my street tacos were probably the tastiest part of both meals.  For the price and the portion size I would not recommend the same things we ordered. It might be my fault for ordering the steak tacos at a \"shi-shi\" restaurant but to be fair at $14 I was expecting the best steak tacos I've ever had. I mean at least filet mignon quality meat. At best the meat was a crusty black-seared ribeye, which isn't bad but could easily be made at home.  Cheaper and tasty alternatives: Two Hippies Pizza Shack and America's Taco Shop, both not too far away.",

This last time, I ordered the steak tacos and the strawberry chopped salad.  Both were good, although the steak tacos were fairly small and left me wanting more.  Moreover, for the prices that I paid, I was hoping for better.  I feel like I could have gotten the same or similar items at other restaurants that would have tasted much better and/or been less expensive.  If I was a vegetarian, vegan, or looking for gluten free items, then I am sure I would love True Food Kitchen.  As just a regular guy looking for a good night's dinner on a Saturday night, this restaurant fell short and was just \"meh\".",

    "text": "Solid three stars. The menu is \"globally inspired\" but still manages to come off as little more than another New American restaurant riding on its gluten-free, veg 'n' vegan laurels. If you think Pei Wei is \"globally inspired\" good eats, you'll probably dig True Foods. Or if you're looking for a place to take even the pickiest of eaters be they bland food lovers or gluten-lactose intolerant vegetarians.  Tip 1: Beware the nouveau health guru buzz words on the menu.   Enjoyed the ginger carrot elixir, thought the pomegranate juice was mega overpriced, and why? Because of the omg!antioxidants? Potatoes have freakin' antioxidants but I'm not about to drink a tater slurry.  Tip 2: The food is chain-restaurant quality.  The apps are fairly meager and like everything else on the menu, too expensive for what you get. Hummus comes with a couple measly pita triangles, so make sure to ask for more. The caramelized onion tart is another small but tasty option to share between two people.  The TLT (tempeh, lettuce, and tomato) was a major bummer. The tempeh was cold and hard to bite through, the bread was so dry it tore up the roof of my mouth, and they left off the avocado and mayo. Bison burger was much more moist but practically fell apart upon first bite, so make sure you got a knife and fork at the ready. The kale salad and sweet potatoes are the bomb though. Consider just getting 'em solo to avoid a lackluster entree.  Tip 3. Your food will take freakin' forever to get to you.  The service is obsequious and annoying, but also manages to come off as condescending, impersonal, and rushed? WTH? Doubly annoying since the food usually takes a loooong time to reach your table.",

    "text": "The most deliciously guiltless meal you could ever have.  Came in for the first time with my sister on Saturday for brunch. The place was packed - and righteously so. We had to wait for probably ten minutes as we came in asking simply for the next available table (rather than asking to sit outside... The weather was gorgeous but satiating our hunger mattered more at that point :)).   My sister ordered the red chili shrimp, I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole with grilled chicken. We asked if we could share a Weekend Warrior, and the server told us Sure! without hesitation.   Red Chili Shrimp was spot on. The flavors were great, and we were honestly surprised. Usually when an American restaurant takes on Asian/Asian-inspired menu items, we can tell that it's for an Americanized palate. My only note: the server warned my sister that her dish was spicy. To my Asian brothers and sisters who savor the heat from an authentic Thai dish, or Vietnamese bun bo hue, or a hearty Indian curry.... the meaning of \"spicy\" here and the meaning of \"spicy\" to your palate most likely aren't equal. Yes, you could taste the spice, but you couldn't FEEL the spice (and I'm a gal that typically likes to FEEL the spice). Not knocking the dish, because it was cooked to perfection, but I just wanted to put that out there for those who might be expecting more of a kick.   The Spaghetti Squash Casserole was absolutely satisfying. Everything went together perfectly. The tomato sauce had great flavor and saucy thickness to it as one would expect for a typical pasta dish. The chicken was grilled to perfection. Didn't leave my mouth with any gritty taste of burnt, but a real grilled flavor that more chefs could use to master. The fresh mozzarella was definitely the irresistible icing on the cake. Melted to the right consistency to meld with the rest of the rich flavors of the dish. If I could have spaghetti in squash form more often, I'd definitely go for it. Well done, TFK. Hats off to you!  And holy cow, I've honestly been craving a Weekend Warrior since I finished my cup. Speaking of, they brought it out in two separate cups, which my sister and I certainly appreciated. Before getting the drink I thought they would've just given us two straws to share. Happy they didn't go that route. :) Simply good service.  Anyway, who knew almond butter and flax could go well in a smoothie? If TFK broke off a part of its business to specialize in smoothies, I would happily be a dedicated customer even solely to that. Seriously, Jamba Juice -  can you learn something from TFK?!   Really great service. Attentive enough to make you comfortable and never needing anything, and giving you and your company the privacy you want.   A great casual dining experience I'd recommend to all. Can't wait to return!  P.S. It'd be much appreciated if you introduce this great thing you've got going on with the rest of the states. AZ, CA, and CO can't be the ones who have all the luck!",

I can appreciate the idea behind this place but holy shit this place is over priced for what you get. Everything needed salt and I kind of expected that. I will say that the pizza we tried was good. We tried the shrimp, roasted red peppers, and goat cheese pizza and it was suprisingly good. I did not think I would care for shrimp on a pizza but dam it, it was a good combo for sure. I also got the turkey pita. It had a great dresing on it just did not have enough of it. The pita bread was so dry i drank two glasses of water just to get it down.  When you eat this you know your eating healty so its just blah. They use all local products which  I like and the menue changes with the season wich I like but everything we tried was lacking flavor . I went with 6 people and everybody shared so we could all try everything. Betweeen all of us we tried 6 different dishes and two apps. They have an outside patio and the inside decor is nice. We got the private table in the back wich was cool. The restrooms sinks are very cool and they have the best hand driers ever in the restrooms as well, not really important just thought I would mention that. Anyways If your a healthy eater than this place is worth a try. For me if I'm going to spend $15-20 for myself I would choose so many other places.",

I have been waiting for this restaurant to open as I am a huge Andrew Weil fan and love the Sam Fox restaurants in Scottsdale.  The menu is terrific, the service was great, the ambiance was unique (the prep tables and kitchen are both in the dining room), but the food was a huge disappointment.  My husband and I sat on the patio at a corner table which was delightful.  Our server, Christina, was a amazing, but that only earned the place two stars.  My disappointment began with the water which tasted salty and like dishwater (not that I've ever tasted dishwater, but this is what I would imagine the taste to be).  Next was the hummus, which tasted, salty.  My husband ordered the salmon which, you guessed it, tasted salty.  I, on the other hand did enjoy the butternut squash ravioli.  For dessert, we had the flourless chocolate cake which would have been so much better if it had been heated and if the ice-cream with which it was served had the remote taste and texture of ice-cream.  To the credit of management, we were refunded price of the hummus and salmon.  When we left the restaurant, I looked deep into my husband's eyes and whispered softly, I don't think we'll be back here for dinner again.",

There is plenty of space, and the seats feel like couches, so it is essentially like being in your living room with your own a private fire pit.  Then there is the menu, which is simple, yet intriguing, particularly due to the fact most of the ingredients are grown locally, some are grown on-site, and there are a number of nutrient dense items not commonly found on restaurant menus, i.e. quinoa, kale, etc..  I realized I couldn't try everything on the first visit, so I went with the Grilled Steelhead Salmon, came back later the same day for the Grass Fed Bison Burger, and then later visited their newly opened restaurant in Santa Monica, CA and had the Angus Steak Tacos with quinoa.  Equally important as the experience with the food was the experience with the service staff, which was friendly, attentive, and knowledgeable about the menu.  There are still things on the menu I'd like to try, so I'll be going back soon!",

We had tried to make a reservation but they only allow reservations for 7 or more so since we were a party of five we decided to take our chances.  Our wait only ended up being about a 1/2 hour maybe more... that flew by as we were ordering drinks and talking amongst ourselves.  I chose the organic honey lemonade with a shot of their organic Square One vodka... very tasty:).  Others had the pomegranate sparkler and the Medicine Man with a shot of organic vodka.  The medicine man had Olivello Juice, Pomegranate Juice, Cranberry Juice, Black Tea, Soda Water& Muddled blueberries... I tasted this one and it was also very yummy.  The restaurant is very open, not very intimate but still very cool... they also have a nice patio which is were we were sat.  For apps we had the Edamame Dumplings and the Crudites... they both were really good but my favorite was the dumplings.  For dinner I had the Butternut Squash Ravioli with Mushrooms, Savoy Cabbage & Pistachios... it was 3 large ravioli's with a very tasty sauce.  It was a little sweet so if you don't like sweet entrees this might not be for you.  Michael had the Ahi Sliders which he said were really good.  Others had the Miso Glazed Black Cod and the Turkey Bolognese.  I tried both of these and I must say that I cannot wait to come back and try other items on their menu.  I think the best part is this place is not expensive at all!  We had cocktails, appetizers and entrees and it was about $30 per person... that includes the tip.  Not bad!",

Now it was a nice night out on a Friday and I felt like sitting outside which I requested. The hostess then scoffed, gave me a dirty look, and repeated that there where tables available inside and if we sat outside she would have to clean it first. We eventually got to sit outside...with an attitude. We apparently must have upset someone because we were neglected for about 15 minutes even though at that time the restaurant wasn't busy. When we did get service it to was with an attitude but the food was awesome. The edamame dumplings were seriously incredible. Now here is where it gets really bad...we gave a card to pay and when we received our receipt back the receipt read $54.00 but the copy we were to sign was charging us $68.00. Keep in mind we were a party of just 2 so the gratuity shouldn't have been added in.  When we pointed out the error no one seemed surprised or particular concerned that we were over charged. They corrected the issue but were so nonchalant about it that we walked away feeling like this was possibly a scam that the staff often tries to run that we were lucky enough to avoid. The moral of this review is to warn you to review your receipts carefully and if you don't want to wait on people you should get out of the service industry.",

    "text": "I've been here 5 times and \"take away\" 3 times since their opening and have had great \"clean, organic, healthy\" food each time.  Love it and it makes you feel so good.  Great decor, I practice the diet philosophy and really appreciate the extra hard work that goes into the prep.  The salmon, wild Alaska sockeye, sustainably harvested--thank you.  More US restaurants need to buy wild Alaskan fish. The salmon was as good as my Alaska summer salmon eating experience at Cafe Orca.    Not overcooked--thank you again.  The black cod is fabulous, paired nicely with a sake.  The salmon came with a delicious kale salad, simply flavored with ?pecorino? cheese, evoo and lemon--wonderful and great for my health concerns.  Have had all the appetizers and each is great in its own right and you really can't loose.  Now I just have to get beyond the fish and try some of the other entree's.  I like that they don't offer any chemicals and feature organics and take away is dished up in biodegradable packaging.  Service is efficient, friendly and unpretentious.  Only one fault, once, the hostesses were too busy with their personal conversation to say good bye--no biggie, since I go for the food which you can't get anywhere else.  Price is good considering the extra expense they incur for procuring higher quality ingredients and the extra cost of food prep requiring more labor.  A good choice for lifestyle conscious dining, so take that really fussy, eccentric, quirky friend that is never pleased and watch the smile return to their critical face.  Worth every penny!  One itty bitty suggestion for Sam and Andrew--Alaskan Oysters on the half shell!  I'll be back--soon!",

My friend had a sandwich that he declared \"high end deli-ish.\" The appetizers were actually the star of our meal - some kind of seared ahi/sesame concoction and seafood potstickers. They seem to be relying a lot on the organic schtik, which really only works if the raw ingredients are used artfully. In this case I think they are missing the boat. The mock-tails were fun (but a lot of money for no hooch). Added gin to the 2nd one and was much more satisfied. This actually probably would have been a 4 star experience except the service just flat out sucked. Took 10 minutes for someone to bring waters and another 10 for the waiter to show up. I think they must have gotten their sections screwed up or something. Sadly it never really improved. They do get brownie points for seriously sprucing up the old Coffee Plant though. Nice atmosphere and gorgeous patio.",

The wait staff was courteous and friendly, explaining the menu without making us feel like preschoolers. I tried the cucumber lemonade, which once you get past the deep green color, was pleasantly sweet and tangy with a pronounced cucumber flavor. The very definition of refreshing. When we told our server we'd be sharing the Green Tea Soba Noodles, he split the dish into half servings at no extra charge. The noodles were tender and hot, accompanied by a shitakes, broccoli, bok choy and pea pods all immersed in a salty ginger-soy broth. We also tried the sweet potato hash, a sauteed blend of dice potato, onion, olive oil and black pepper. Again, delicious. Since I'm this impressed after only three items, I look forward to going back for more.",

    "text": "True Food Kitchen claims to not be a health-food restaurant, rather a place for great food that just so happens to be healthy. Whatever you want to call it, when you sit down, you'll be handed a card explaining nutrition guru Dr. Andrew Weil's food philosophies and explaining their ingredients and food items until you no longer have an appetite. However, give this place a chance - it's not all about health at the sacrifice of flavor. The decor perfectly highlights the culinary concept, with clean, modern lines, big open windows, and LOTS of green. Andrew's Elixir, one of their refresher drinks, was delightful. The best food item we had was the caramelized onion tart appetizer, with gorgonzola cheese, black figs, and caramelized onions on a crispy flat crust. It was the perfect balance of the sweet mild onions and sweet figs with savory cheese and light, crispy crust. Our server said this is the same crust as their pizzas, so next time I'd like to try those. Next, we had the edamame dumplings, which is basically steamed won tons filled with pureed edamame in a light miso broth. These were good, not great. For our entree, we ordered the black cod, but we had to send it back because it was so fishy (and undercooked). When I asked the server if the fish is fresh or fresh-frozen, he said, \"Well, they're all fresh-frozen.\" Their fish entrees are $22, which seems inexpensive, but they're fairly small portions. For that kind of price in this type of restaurant, I would expect fresh fish. Perhaps the fresh-frozen fish is a cost-cutting measure in what seems to be the increasingly corporate Sam Fox empire. We went with the salmon instead, which was also undercooked but far less fishy. The roasted apples and pureed celery root were lovely, but the dish as a whole was a little overpowered by the mustard sauce, and the accompanying vegetables were weird. Prices overall are very reasonable, especially if you stick with appetizers, salads, pizzas, and sandwiches. True Food aims for the lofty goal of making great cuisine that just so happens to be extremely healthy, and occasionally misses the mark, but I give them credit for bringing Dr. Andrew Weil's philosophies on the importance of nutrition for the body and mind to the mainstream.",

The Andy's TLT, a vegan version of the American classic BLT, using Vegenaise and cruelty-free tempeh instead of bacon, is my favorite go-to.  The Organic Tuscan Kale Salad, sans the cheese, is delicious.  They've recently added new vegan items, like the Roasted Brussels Sprouts, a Charred Cauliflower dish, and a Beet Bruschetta.  So far, I've tried the Brussels Sprouts, which were very good.   As for the desserts, the squash pie (seasonal item, usually available autumn to winter), and the Apple Goji Crisp (basically, an apple cobbler) a la mode, courtesy of a delicious coconut ice cream, are all scrumptious!  This location has messed up my carry-out orders so be sure to double-check your orders before leaving.",

We Ordered ~Medicine Man (Pomegranate, Cranberry,Honey, Black Tea & Soda) $6 ~Root & Remedy (Beet, Carrot, Ginger, Turmeric & Honey Lemonade) $6 ~Edamame Dumplings (Daikon Radish & White Truffle Oil) $9 ~Spaghetti squash casserole (Fresh Mozzarella, Organic Tomato & Zucchini) $13 ~Flourless Chocolate cake (Cocoa, Vanilla Ice Cream, Almond Butter & Caramel) $7  Let me start by saying how beautiful the drinks looked when they arrived,very appetizing.The Medicine Man has a dominant taste of black tea with hints of other ingredients while Root & Remedy is more like a ginger and honey lemonade.It is impossible to guess what goes into the drinks unless you read the ingredients which i think is great.I technically did drink a lot of vegetables and healthy stuff compared to a regular Soda.The Edamame dumplings were great i wish they would serve more than four.My spaghetti squash casserole was delish, again i would have never guessed it had zucchini (which i isolate from my dishes). The only thing i wasn't a fan of was the flourless Chocolate cake, not that it tasted bad but it there was more caramel than chocolate.  Our server Jessica was wonderful and friendly.The food got to the table pretty fast.A lot of the items on their menu are gluten free.In the End my taste buds were happy and i will definitely be back for some more of that Healthy Delicious Experience.

They work so hard to make right. Sometimes when I coming in I can tell they are slammed, every table full and 10 to go orders up and yet they all are so positive and each team member is working so hard. It is like watching a dance. Everyone knows there part and does it flawlessly. I have a few issues over the years but every time the manager handles it so well. This place is truly the best and it all because of the amazing team and yummy food!!",

I have spent 20 years in a previous career inside the customer service business and managed a very successful operation so I enjoy giving my business to places that do it right.  I want to give a shout out to David who was very energetic, polite, helpful, and curtious. He had a large table and everything was on point.  Also Ben was very observant and personable. Made us feel welcomed and he to was very helpful.  Thirdly, Tessa's smile, energy, and personality could be spotted from across the room and was very friendly and inviting.  In all I give kudos to the manager for noticing such great qualities in these individuals and what atleast looking from the outside it seems to be ran well and organized.  Next time in town I will be sure to be back. Keep up the great work",

As for the guacamole, I was not impressed. Grapefruit is a great idea but in practice it was inferior in more than one way, lacking a citrus flavour as well as missing a sour or zangy tongue taste. Also the pablano pepper offered no barbeque or smokiness nor was it spicy. A guacamole that wasn't tangy of spicy is like a Mulligan.   The char califour did not live up to expectations for me, but anyone with a sweet tooth will enjoy the dates and mint. Honestly without that sweetness it would have been great. It has a great kick of flavour but I was told it would spicy. Just not a fan.   I would love to come back and try the TDL tempeh blt crossover. Maybe next time.",

Their menu is based on non-inflammatory and healthy foods, yet every dish is carefully crafted to provide a unique taste. I recently got the grilled chicken salad, which was light and delicious. It has a nice crunch with the apples in it, and the chicken was very savory. My sister got the vegan TLT sandwich. The sandwich comes with one side, and it shockingly tastes like BLT.   Overall, the service was excellent from the lovely host, who greeted us in the entrance, to the waiter who served us. Always a favorite spot to go to!",

At $13, don't try to break down the cost of what it is. It's a bucks worth of veggies for $13. I had Salmon for $23. Small portions again. We also had chicken and spaghetti squash. 3 drinks, Total $100.

I ordered the fish tacos and decided on the Skinny Margarita. It's called a skinny margarita because it's made with fresh juices and not because it's made with that low-calorie margarita mixer. <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/XMMLRvV4IMxIGyc4H37LxA#QnIja5A6SwqeJcFfPfZRqA\">yelp.com/biz_photos/XMML...</a>  The margarita was refreshing and my tacos were great. Very light, freshly made and my server Jake brought me two different types of hot sauce.

Their salad staple is the Tuscan Kale salad, which is full of crisp kale greens, sprinkled with parmesean cheese and a lemon spiced dressing.  Really fresh tasting and super delicious!  My other favorite salad (when it's in season) is the Roasted Vegetable Ingredient salad.  Roasted veggies (think califlower, squash, brussel sprouts), pomegranate seeds and mulberry with a horseradish dressing.  It is absolutely SUPERB!!  My only issue with it was that for some reason this time the salad was about half the size it used to be.  I mean, I don't normally eat a ton, but this was so tiny that I was still pretty hungry after.  Not sure if they changed the portion size, or if they were running out of ingredients, but for $12 I expect to be satiated.  Overall, I love the quality of the ingredients at True Foods and will definitely be coming back to get my healthy eating on :)",

There are not very many choices for vegans. The things I was able to order, were good, my favorite being an appetizer of roast root veggies and dips. That seemed to be a hit with everyone at my table. It was a nice portion for the price. I ordered a salad for my main course, which I hate to do. It was just ok. I'm not a big fan of salad dressings, but I think I only had one other option for a meal.   I think I'd like True Food for a pricey cocktail and appetizer, but not again for a meal.  As a final note, I do not know anything about the anti-inflammatory diet, but I find the whole \"grass fed beef\" thing disturbing. Beef does not eat grass, a cow does. Sustainable fish is as impossible as the idea of \"humane meat\".",

I drank the Honey Lemonade, which was so refreshing after my long flight!  We ate outside on the terrace so I could enjoy the weather.  We kicked off our meal with Shiitake & Tofu Lettuce Cups.  This is not something I would normally order, but I found them to be very flavorful.  The filling was warm, a little nuttier than I prefer, but good!  For my main dish, I had the Turkey Lasagna (Sissy had a delish Spaghetti Squash Casserole) and LOVED it.  It was very hot coming out of the oven, but it was soooo good.  The portion was perfect, and the green spinach noodles and fresh ricotta were awesome.  I ate every bit.  And scraped the dish for sauce and cheese after.  Yum.",

My fiance is more of a burger and fries type of guy and when he first glanced over the menu, wasn't too sure he'd find something he'd like. Even from a health nut perspective, I was a bit unsure myself as I studied the menu. A lot of the meal descriptions have a list of odd and peculiar combinations of ingredients.. It was hard to picture what the dish might look like or if the flavors would go well together.  We played it pretty safe - He went with the breakfast burrito and I went with kale salad + chicken. We both really enjoyed our meals and felt guilt free about our food choices. Everything was fresh, service was attentive, and surprisingly there was no wait at 11:45 AM on the weekend in a popular area of town.  Great covered patio that allows for ample seating in the shade. Inside is trendy and allows full visibility into the kitchen so that patrons may see the staff prepping everything from scratch.",

Rory and the staff went to every length to make sure we had everything we needed, from tastes of wine to extra veggies & pita for the hummus appetizer (which was fantastic).  I had the sea bass, which was savory as Rory had described.  I decided I wanted a little pop of flavor with a sauce and Rory brought me some sort of lemon dressing that was fantastic.

They put grapefruit in their guacamole, which is bizarre, but yum yum yum.   We had a variety of meals, from vegetarian to Moroccan, to a steak bowl, and all of us were quite satisfied & very full.  And caution, It does get a bit pricey when you start adding beverages or meat To the meals.",

When I usually eat out, I generally choose inflammatory, non-local, synthetic foods, so eating lunch here was a departure from normal. Truthfully, my friend chose it because it was 10ft away from our breakfast at Frost. As usual, the restaurant is open and spacious, filled with green plants, and adorned with wooden tables. Although it was near lunch time, the place was nearly empty. We were seated immediately and our server was quite attentive.  The menu is diverse with cuisines from around the world using all local foods. I had the chicken chopped salad which was just like the salads I pack for lunch except more delicious. My salad made me want to be better. I think True Food changed my life because now I want to add manchego cheese to everything. This is where I imagine hosting future power lunches.",

    "text": "Another tough one that will require revisiting and re-scoring in a few to several months, if things change. Had a few visits so far, with generally good but mixed results.  THE CONCEPT - 4 Stars I'm no Weil disciple who drops to their knees and goes all agape for his every utterance. But I think he is the perfect partner for a Fox concept, as long as the fresh, fresh, fresh motto is adhered to over the long term. I like some of the Fox places (okay one, Greene House) and it's the same chef that opened True Food.  My Dad was recently diagnosed with Seliac Disease and seeing more and more restaurants acknowledge that dietary restriction on gluten is important to a growing segment of people is refreshing. The menu makes it easy to distinguish between various dietary regimens and other considerations, in both food and drink. I eat anything, but it sure makes it easier to eat with those who are justifiably (and sometimes unjustifiably) conscious of what they put in their bodies.  Everything from the mixed drinks to the food items seems to be VERY fresh, or at least sourced very well.  THE SPACE - 4 Stars Simple, modern, open California kitchen appeal. I like how they raised the ceiling of the old Coffee Plantation shithole. The mural wall and the over-sized lamps are fun. Open kitchens are always a little more fun and give you something to talk about if your date is lacking in conversational acumen.  THE EXECUTION (for now) - 3 Stars  Service They're trying. Things still seem jittery with some of the servers. Have seen a lot of food go to the wrong tables and places. I'm sure they'll work through that. Everyone is friendly, but not necessarily knowledgable about the food. Sure they've memorized the spiel, but these aren't foodie servers. They're young, friendly folks working at a hip spot.  Food Have tried several things that were tasty and fresh, if not particularly interesting. They just kind of show you that you can eat stuff that is relatively healthy and not have it taste like nothing. A few things so far have shined: the spelt pizzas have a unique, chewy crust and nice toppings. The Kale Salad is unique and delicious. Nice textures. The Shrimp Dumplings are nice, but make you yearn to eat real chinese, or make your own like you like 'em. Steak Tacos are of the Fresh Mex variety but have a great char.  On the downside...  I had the Turkey Bolognese Penne. To me, there is never an excuse for overcooked pasta. If you cook it, and it's overdone, throw it away and cook it again. Check your pasta, it's the heart of the dish. I neglected to order \"al dente\" because so many places give you that look like \"But of course, signore!\" And you shouldn't have to ask for pasta to be done that way. That's the only way it should be done, unless you're eating Spaghettios. As for the sauce, it tasted like diced San Marzano's which is great! But if you use the canned San Marzano's omit the little pieces with the unchewable stem base. Cut that part out or pitch the piece. I added shrimp to the dish at the server's suggestions, despite my past history of NOT combining shrimp and turkey. Call me crazy, but that's just not a combo I yearn for. Would have been fine though, except that the shrimp were completely undercooked. I eat shrimp raw, when I intend to, but that clear uncooked shrimp is not the texture you want in a cooked dish. At sashimi/sushi, yes. Pasta, no. Seems to happen a lot though. And no discernible seasoning or flavor to them either.  My wife's salmon was largely flavorless, and very rare. Fine for us as we love raw salmon. But at a certain point, she just would have preferred sashimi and the accompanying soy sauce. I'm sure the amount or rareness would have been a problem for many diners. Especially when combined with almost no salt. On that note, the fresh fish crudo of the day was a nice hamachi with an excellent yuzu/miso (? - that's what it tasted like) sauce.   BOTTOM LINE - 3 Stars for now I could see this going either way in the future, but if they stay fresh and improve on the execution, it's a no-brainer that they will end up a 4 star. I don't think they'll ever hit 5 stars, just because their commitment to the healthy stuff and a very broad appeal will keep them from really being able to push it from a culinary standpoint.",

    "text": "I usually only lurk on Yelp but felt compelled to write my first review to warn others about how much this restaurant sucks.  I gave up $30 tonight for what might have been the least tasty food I've eaten in at least 6 months. In fact, to say that it was the least tasty food I've had eaten in at least 6 months doesn't even begin to adequately describe the horrific culinary abominations I consumed against my better judgment at this \"establishment\".  When I first heard about True Food, I was excited to try it out. With my pita, green tea soba noodles and chocolate pudding, however, I was incredibly disappointed. Actually, \"incredibly disappointed\" is an understatement. I was beyond disgusted. I do not like to waste food so I always try to finish everything I order. However, I was unable to eat all of the \"noodle\" dish. If I had forced myself to do so I fear I might have had to make a run to the restroom for a quick vomit before \"dessert\".  This food is not just subpar, it is a disgrace to the culinary arts in general. This is some of the worst \"food\" I have had the misfortune of choking down in my short life and yet they have the nerve to charge those prices for it. Perhaps they are charging for ambiance. The food certainly is not worth that much.  When I had pancreatitis a couple of years back, I vomited bile the color of green antifreeze. I could not make it to a toilet in time so I had to attempt to swallow the bile. I can say with total honesty that the bile tasted as good as - if not better than - the \"meal\" I ate tonight.  I would quite honestly rather die an excruciatingly painful death than ever dine here again. I am not exaggerating. I will be avoiding it at all costs and advising all of my friends to do the same.",

    "text": "I guess I was expecting more. While I dig the clean open vibe and the location, the menu left me wanting more. I was hoping for more wheat, soy and dairy free options...  On this trip I sat at the bar and decided on the Seared Aji Sliders and was given the options of roasted sweet potatoes or the kale salad. When the waitress/bartender saw my difficulty in trying to decide she offered up half of each. That was easy! I have to agree with a few Yelpers here I will be going back for the Kale Salad. The flavor was zesty and the texture wonderful although I will ask them to pass on the crumb topping next time. And while a fan of sweet potatoes in general, I found these to be over roasted dry/chewy tidbits I chased around my plate trying to eat and generally unimpressive. As for the sliders themselves. I was wishing for more of the wasabi aoli and sprouts. I wish the sear was on a hotter grill because they ended up slightly overcooked and not really seared.  For my beverage I had the Nojito.  I have had and I make something similar at home frequently  with fresh ginger, mint and fresh lemons and/or limes sweetened with either stevia, honey or agave nectar (depending on what I have on hand).  I was expecting the same quality, however the lemon juice tasted bottled and not fresh, it was just ok.   Over all I would probably go back as I do value their organic natural approach but for the price I may just stick to the options I get around the corner at Phoenix Public Market and I keep it local.",

I mean, I am being patient while they work the kinks out, but for a chain (or shall I say potential chain) I think it is a fresh change in the sea of steak houses and Asian fusion joints.  The decor is fresh and sunny although the hard surfaces lend to poor acoustics. You may have to scream at you dinner date on a busy night. The staff is young and ridiculously healthy looking. I can't help but wonder if a pre-employment requirement is a complete body loofah scrubbing and two weeks of colon cleansing. Even some of the older management and staff appear to have just had micro-dermabrasion.  But hey, in at new take on a health food joint, maybe it's just good marketing. The staff is the problem however. They all seem so young that they have no experiance. They are kind of wondering aroung while your food is stuck who knows where. On my last visit a nice young man named Steve was my server and he was beyound good. I complimented management on him and will ask for him from now on. To the food. I am a very healthy eater so it is right up my allie. I can't get enough of the kale salad. I ask for it with chicken. The Miso soup is simple but full of flavor. The deserts are good as well. You don't have to take home you heavy guilt with your full tummy. I have had all of the salads and you just can't go wrong, perfectly dressed to show of the perfectly ripened seasonal veggies.  The wine list is interesting and fairly priced, chalked full of sustainable and organically produced wines that also taste great. You can even have organic vodka with you veggie refresher drinks. Who knew? Look, if fast food is your bag and you are looking to commit suicide via coronary disease... skip this place.

    "text": "We walked by True Food Kitchen a week before opening and it looked promising. We decided to try it one night after hitting the gym thinking it would be a healthy way to follow our workout. We also like most of the other restaurants in the Fox  Restaurant group and thought we couldn't go wrong.  The restaurant was crowded but there was no wait for patio seating when we arrived.   Our waitress did a very poor job explaining the menu. The Sandwiches come with a choice of sweet potato hash or a side salad. The only way we knew this was overhearing a conversion at the table next to us. The Ahi sliders no longer come on pumpernickel bread but on Hawaiian roles and there is no way to know this as the menu still says pumpernickel.   I decided to order the Grilled Wild Salmon sandwich with a side of sweet potato's. My fiancee ordered the Wild Ahi Sliders. During the wait for my meal the waitress said that my lemonade came with one free refil (also not listed on the menu). The food arrived and I was served the Grilled Salmon with Roasted Organic Vegetables off the Pastas & Entrees menu and not the sandwich that I ordered. A plate of cold cubed sweet potato's accompanied the entree. I immediately told the waitress that I ordered the sandwich and she argued with me that I ordered the entree. She finally relented and took the item back but left the cold sweet potatos. My fiancee's sliders were ok but were rather tasteless and lacked the wasabi advertised on the menu.  Ten minutes later my open faced sandwich arrived and on the same plate were more of the cold sweet potatos. The salmon was overcooked and dry. The avocado wasn't ripe and almost crunchy. The potatos were tasteless, dry, and cold.   When the bill came the waitress apologized for the error and said the two salmon dishes are causing a lot of ordering errors. She said she gets yelled at for the errors which explains why she initially insisted that I ordered the entree. She didn't charge for the sandwich but I did get charged $6 for the cold potato's when the menu lists them as $5. I figured she was having a rough night and just paid the bill.   This restaurant is really not up to the Fox Restaurant standards. The menu is riddled with inconsistencies and the food is bland and tasteless. We looked at the food on other patrons table and the other menu items didn't look any better.   This place would probably do better as a lunch place if they lowered their prices.   In the mean time, save your money and head to Bloom, Sauce, Olive & Ivy, or any of the other Fox Restaurants.",

Their turkey burger, protein style, is perfect here at the PHX location.  I had one at their Scottsdale location and it was underseasoned to say the least.  Their cod dish is delicious.  When they serve himachi as their \"raw fish of the day\", it was perfect.  I'm also a fan of their sweet potato hash.  The chicken chopped salad is good.  And, last but not least, their mushroom pizza is to die for.",

    "text": "My visit to True Food was lovely.  As I approached the entrance one of the employees was picking fresh basil from the front herb-garden-flower-box thing, and as my friends and I entered I saw the open kitchen area where people were cutting up fresh carrots and other veggies.  The feeling of freshness was all around me with the hustle and bustle of the open kitchen, the easy, breezy, yoga-like attire of the staff, the high ceilings and the open windows.  Our waiter explained the restaurant concept and told us about the menu as well as Dr. Weil's philosophy for food and health.   I decided to try their specialty drink, the cucumber refresher, out of curiosity.  It was a cool refreshing glass of cucumber and honey lemonade.  My friends and I decided to share the hummus as an appetizer.  The hummus was delicious, although I would not dare to compare it to any authentic hummus/ pita plates.  The amount of pita served with it was a bit insufficient for the amount of hummus.  However, there was no problem getting more pita, the waiter graciously brought us more for no additional charge.   For my lunch entree, I ordered the sashimi tuna salad with avocado, cucumber, tomato, edamame & ginger, which I thoroughly enjoyed.  It was very light and fresh, as it sounds like it should be:)  The flavor of the ginger complemented the salad perfectly and the dressing did not over power the other flavors and textures.  My friends both seemed to enjoy their meals as well.  I left feeling good and ready to return soon.    And return soon I did, this time with my boyfriend in tow.  He eats a low glucose index diet and I was excited to take him to True Food because the food seemed so clean.  When we arrived this time the service was very similar to my first experience but as we spoke with the waiter and my boyfriend explained the low G.I. diet, the waiter seemed unfamiliar with this concept.  We asked him for some recommendations and he suggested the harvest chopped salad for him.  I ordered the wild ahi sliders with wasabi, radishes, cucumber on pumpernickel.  The sliders were fabulous!  They were flavorful, perfectly seasoned with the wasabi, and seared to near perfection.  My boyfriend's salad on the other hand, was less satisfactory.  For one, the waiter didn't really understand the low glucose diet when he recommended the salad, which was a lot like a Waldorf salad, containing sugary fruits and such.  Secondly, the salad was soaked with dressing, unlike the perfectly balanced sashimi salad that I had enjoyed there a week or so before.  The salad was so wet that the greens were lost in there!  I was very sad because I had such high hopes for his first True Food experience.  I would still recommend True Food because overall my experience was good, but perhaps next time we will order our salads with the dressing on the side......eeep!",

    "text": "I have to say that I am underwhelmed.    First - the good.  I went with a group of 7 and we were able to sit in the private room in the back.  It was great to have the noise of the restaurant shut out and we loved the room's decor.  Second - the bad.  OK, it wasn't that anything was bad, it was all just sort of fine.  It tasted like dinner you would have at someone's house.  It was all more than edible, some things very different, but a little blander or a little less fantastic than i expect from a restaurant.  The chopped salad and onion tart with figs were both good, but anyone can do a chopped salad.  I thought the shrimp dumplings were just OK and the kale salad was underdressed and basically just tasted like you were eating raw kale.  The butternut squash ravioli were too sweet and the sauce was a little flavorless.  For desert, the chocolate cake was good but I've had better and while the bananas on the banana chocolate tart were good, the tart itself was like a stale piece of pita.  One highlight was the beans that came with the steak tacos - they were very flavorful and tasty.  My final thought is that to serve good, honest, healthy, sustainable food doesn't mean you have to be quite so crunchy.  I think some in our party were turned off by the granola-feel of the menu.  It would be great to see a few more common dishes done in a healthy way and prove that healthy doesn't have to mean low-flavor.",

    "text": "Three stars means A-OK, and that's exactly what this was.    Ambiance and service were spot on, as were menu choices.  But the food, for me, just didn't deliver.  Began with the carmelized onion tart and the hummus.  Both were good --and both made interesting by the addition of figs.  But neither were that interesting, or that big.  I hemmed and hawed over several nice vegetarian/vegan options and decided on the teriyaki tofu.  Big mistake, I think.  It tasted like soy and sesame, and veggies and rice.  All good things but all completely identical to most of my weeknight meals at home.  I sat there eating it wondering why I'd come to a restaurant to eat a fairly standard stir fry tofu.  I also didn't like the banana chocolate dessert.  Way too sweet!  So why the three stars?  Like I say, service and ambiance were perfect.  And I really liked the wine our server recommended --an organic red from Spain.  My mom and aunt loved their meals, and my mom's dessert --an apple and cranberry crumble, was heaven!  So I guess, truth be told, I'm blaming myself.   Dang, though, usually I nail it when it comes to ordering something that will satisfy me!",

The problem with this place is...the price! Non-alcoholic drinks are like $6 each and they come in these narrow glasses full of ice. (I tried the \"no ice, please\" thing and they just give you less!\") For that price there should be a shot or free refills. Also, my fave is the Med. salad and I add chicken which runs me a full $20 and barely fills me up. For a big guy, there is no way that would be enough. Add a drink and it's like $30/person to eat in for a salad and lemonade! So the food is good but too pricey to be sustainable and I rarely go for this reason.",

I go to these restaurants a lot because my girlfriend's parents love Fox and they buy gift cards by the bushel. Anyway I was True Food the other day and thought I would write a review.  We started off with Chicken Chopped salad, they were out of the Mediterranean which was shocking, (how do you run out of a salad?) The salad was decent, nothing to write home about.  We also split some Edamame dumplings which were the highlight of the night, honestly i should have just ordered two of those for my entree.   For entrees I ordered the Margherita pizza, and my lady order the TLT and we traded halves. The pizza was solid but I wasn't blown away. The TLT on the other hand was actually really good, the Tempeh bacon tastes just like bacon and I would glady order that again.   I've had the panang before and your better off just visiting a Thai restaurant. That's my big problem with the Fox concepts, their menus are all over the place, they have Thai, Italian, American, Mexican, and Mediterranean on the same menu. The food is overpriced and you would be better off visiting a restaurant that specializes in a particular cuisine.  If you like pizza visit Pomo or Cibo  If you like Thai, your better off at any chain, even Thai Basil.  I just wish these places would have fun with the food instead of creating these \"hip\" dishes that sound cool ordering but lack in flavor and originality.  Rant over. It's not so bad when you have a gift card!",

I really even tried to like it. It's just a big jumble of unpleasant flavors. For dessert we shared the lemon tart, and the rhubarb crisp. Both were tremendous!   With all this tasty food to try, it's hard not to get carried away. But keep in mind if you get an appetizer, drink, meal, and dessert... expect to have a pretty hefty bill.   Other than that, my only real complaint is that the light fixtures are really yucky dusty. I know we live in the desert, and it's in a hard to reach place, but it's gross to look up and see all that dust looming above your food...",

The only reason I didn't give 5 stars is it was a little pricey compared to similar menu items at other places.  Service like what Kait provided made it worth it!",

    "text": "What a terrific spot! My salad blew me away.   If you aren't familiar with Fox Restaurant Concepts, they operate a variety of restaurants that emphasize locally sourced, fresh ingredients. This location was new to me but I knew of the brand & their reliably good menus (wild flower).   I had the chicken salad- the manchego cheese, paired with the marcona almonds, the medjool dates, the crunchy jicama- wow, what a pairing! The dehydrated cranberries offered a tart compliment & texture to the sweet dates & both paired well with the manchego. It's topped with a champagne vinaigrette, which is ideal. I ordered it without any farro but it was still filling and absolutely delicious. Not overly sweet, but sweet enough that you feel like you're getting both lunch & dessert.  They had a fantastic selection of juices & tea options! I hear the Hangover beverage with coconut, honey & pineapple is one of their best.  I opted for the iced green tea which I really enjoyed.  I found the ambiance to be cool, hip, with a nice outside seating area. The ceilings were high & you can see into the open kitchen. I was enamored watching the chef dig out multiple spaghetti squash. I think I found a new technique.   With the wood floors, high ceilings and lots of glass, it's pretty noisy. I wish they'd install some noise absorbing material but that aside, I've found a new go to PHX lunch spot.",

The staff is always very nice and eager to make things right if they mess up your order which is very nice. I enjoy the Tuscan Kale Salad and cucumber lemonade!! Other things are yummy as well! I recommend it at off hours so it's a pleasant quiet experience!!",

This place has become out savior when we cannot find an alternate place to eat while in PHX for celiacs.   Had the GF Lasagna. Very well done. Bolognese was almost perfect.  Well seasoned and the flavors come together nicely. My wife had the Moroccan Chicken. Excellent flavor and portion size, Yogurt sauce I can eat gallons of all day long...but I am Greek so whatever. Perfectly matched of course.   My 3yr old, had the grass-fed burger with carrots. Perfectly cooked at MR and seasoned well, awesome flavor.   I'd come here every time as we know it's safe and the food is excellent. I just would ask that  the lasagna was a larger portion or offer 2 sizes for us hungry men!! ;)",

    "text": "First the good stuff. We could get a table on a Saturday night with no wait just by calling ahead a bit. They have a lot of fresh, in-season, and organic food. They cater to people with food allergies, so my gluten-free and dairy-free requests weren't considered at all difficult. Nice variety on the menu. They had 4 desserts, 2 of which I could eat! That alone scores major points with me. The squash pie with coconut cream was a bit heavy on the cinnamon and sweet for my taste, but still delicious. I didn't try the banana-coconut chia pudding, but it sounded good. Staff was very attentive and friendly.  Now the not-so-good stuff. It's in a large shopping center, so parking is quite difficult especially on a Saturday night. The music is very loud, which makes all the customers talk loud, so the ambience felt \"trendy\" but it's annoying to have to almost shout to your friends and family. The drinks are delicious but watered down and over priced. I'd avoid them next time. Food portions on some dishes are quite small. Husband's salmon came with just a small side of mixed greens.",

Once seated I had just enough time to get cozy, for my server to arrive with once again a genuine smile and warm introduction. Her name was Molly and she recommended the lavender iced tea which was exclusive to this seasons menu. The drink was amazing, a fresh aroma of the lavender accompanied by a slight tartness from the lemon, mmm delish! When she came to check to see if I was enjoying my tea I was ready for the main course. I dined on a kale salad and a ancient grains bowl. The kale salad was noticably high quality and fresh, but that ancient grains was the highlight of the dining experience. So many different flavor profiles from an oriental sweet and spicy sauce glazed on diced sweet potatoes. Also some charred onions that gave a nice smokey flavor that matched so well with the mushroom and pesto. As well as many different textures, plus it was totally deconstructed so at my leisure I could get the ratios I wanted. Nearing the end of my dinning experience Kira, one of the managers came by and reassured that I was properly taken care of.looking at the menu there is a taste for every bud, I would highly recommend that everyone give TrueFood a try. If I could give it more than five stars I would! I will definitely be coming back.",

    "text": "This is by far my favorite True Food Kitchen location and I've been to it several times - each time nearly as awesome as the one that came before it.   I love to visit True Food Kitchen on a seasonal basis to try something new each season. I wasn't planning on visiting True Food Kitchen, until they twisted my arm with an offer I couldn't resist.. their Trick or Treat Yourself promotion. Seriously, the best thing I've received for Halloween since I was a kid and dressed up going door to door! I strongly recommend signing up for their e-mails so you don't miss out on future treats.  We sat outside which was lovely, but a little chillier than I had anticipated, which unfortunately impeded my ability to order their Sea Buckthorn Sorbet (though our waitress was kind enough to provide us with a mini taste and its amazing.. but I'm going to have to come back during the day for this one).   For beverages, my husband got the Prosecco, and I ordered the Medicine Man. If you like cranberry juice, this one will be a hit, the pomegranate seeds are a nice touch, but sometimes get lodged in the straw.   We shared the Kale Guacamole and I've had my fill of guacamole of every variety and variant, but this one was new with the pink grapefruit, cilantro, roasted poblano, sunflower seeds and of course kale. Wow! This is a keeper and I would definitely order it again, even my husband who hates grapefruit and kale was incredibly surprised how delicious it was. There is tons of guacamole to share, the lavash crackers it is served with is delicious, but you will probably need to ask for extra.   We then were tied on what pizza to order, our waitress recommended we order half and half. Great suggestion, but one teensy complaint.. they charge you for the most expensive pizza and our waitress unfortunately did not communicate this. We ordered the Butternut Squash pizza $15 with their absolutely delicious vegan almond ricotta and the classic Margherita $12. I would love to see True Food Kitchen either average the amount to $13 or go with the lowest, or even just tell the customer up front how it will be billed!   We shared the T.L.T. sandwich.. which I was very apprehensive about, but curious. Our waitress reminded us that if there was something we didn't like, they would be happy to replace it with something else. I've never had a good relationship with tempeh, in fact I've gone over a decade avoiding it because my experience has never been great. I kept hearing people rave about the T.L.T. and came to two conclusions: 1) everyone has lost their mind 2) True Food Kitchen actually knows the secret to making tempeh taste great.   I decided to live dangerously and pulled out a piece of the tempeh bacon from the sandwich when it arrived. It wasn't quite bacon, but it was still delicious - it was almost like a smoked piece of chicken breast? So there it was, the correct conclusion was 2) True Food Kitchen actually knows the secret to making tempeh taste great. I am happy to announce I would even order the T.L.T. again, it's healthy, nutritious, and best of all vegan - the portion size is great!   I ended up ordering a tried and True favorite for dessert, the Squash Pie, which did not disappoint. You will not believe it's vegan AND gluten free. Yum! Certainly enough for two to share!   Overall service was good, my waitress Danielle was great with a fantastic attitude. My only other critique regarding service was it started up exceptionally well timed and fantastic, and became very slow as more tables were added to her responsibility.   Everything was running smoothly, we sat down around 5:40pm, we breezed through beverages, appetizers, and entrees without a hitch. The entrees came around 6:10pm and we finished about 15 minutes later and waited and waited. Ordered dessert at 6:45pm and about 7:00pm our box for the pizza and dessert came, along with the receipt.   Our waitress forgot to punch in the discount, and I provided her with the gift card I had, she adjusted the amount when the transaction which was put through which was good. It took another 15 minutes before we got the receipt back and I opted to tip in cash because I didn't really want to wait another 15 minutes.   This visit was so close to being a 5 star, minus the points I've addressed here! Darn! Maybe next time.  P.S. Sorry the photos are a little dark, but the lighting was not great outside!",

Adam explained that their menu changes every couple months depending on what the local farmers had in season. He gave me a few minutes to look over the menu while he brought me my water. I tried the hangover RX (I wasn't hungover but it had coconut water my favorite) it was delicious and refreshing. For my entree I ordered the squash casserole which was delicious! I did not know what to expect or if I would get full with just veggies, but let me tell you I did not want it to end. The cheese the sauce the squash everything had a perfect taste. For dessert I had the flourless chocolate caramel cake which was amazing as well! It came with ice cream and that was just as delicious.   I can't wait to return to continue trying their many foods :)",

Wait staff is just excellent. Food comes out quickly and portion sizes are perfect. I am very picky with overly salted food and this is not an issue here; I can actually taste real food as my dish.

    "text": "Trendy spot, local ingredients & strong service   Location: True Food is in a bit of an upscale outdoor mall area; there's a bunch of valet parking (with validation) but also free parking in the north section as well. You may like this but I wasn't crazy about it.   Food: We came here for brunch and quickly exclaimed at all the interesting choices for vegetarians, vegans and people who are neither. The Sunrise Bowl was great: the egg was well cooked and the bowl had fresh ingredients in it. The portions weren't super large. The Garden Scramble was okay too, though the eggs a bit tasteless. The squash pie was a highlight of the meal: light and tasted a bit like pumpkin. The whipped cream was a good pair and not too heavy.   Environment: The decor was open and modernly decorated. They also had some heat lamps in their more outdoor area, which felt nice.   Service: Our server was attentive without being annoying. He seemed to appear at all the right times - pure efficiency.",

    "text": "In my humble opinion, it's hard to go wrong with a Fox Concept, but True Food is top 3 for me.  The menu is ever changing, with seasonal items added frequently. As someone with Celiac Disease, I am very conscious of what I eat. For me, restaurants that have menus with healthy options are terrific, but True Food takes it to a whole new level! The ingredients are fresh, healthy, anti-inflammatory and they have so many Vegan, Vegetarian, and Gluten Fee options. Adding to that, the wait staff is very knowledgeable about ingredients and modifications.  True Food is on the higher end, price wise for a FRC, but the quality makes that understandable. Aside from that, my only complaint is the staff can seem inattentive or unavailable at times, to where you're flagging someone down just for water.",

I had the ramen with tofu which was amazing. Everyone in my party got a different type of bowl from their menu and we loved them all. Also had a bottle of white wine which was good! There wasn't any wait to be sat, which is always nice. I do think it's a bit pricey, but that's to be expected at this type of restaurant in this area. I wish the portions were a bit bigger for the price to bring home some leftovers to make it more worth it. It was definitely fantastic overall and I would recommend this for dates and dinner events.",

One page with maybe 15 items on it....Not much of a selection, limited options for someone who is soy free and gluten free to less than a handful...  I  ordered the Lasagna which was way overpowering with spices it burned my tongue and very very spicy.  I ordered the ancient grain bowl with no miso and sunflower seeds rather than hemp seeds and it was very good and filling, would order it again.  Wish they had more vegan options and the menu was a little bigger.  My brother had the a bowl as well and we also ordered a coconut refresher.  Two bowls, one refresher drink it came out to about $25.per person....Wish they had GF pizza.  It was cool enough to sit outside but lots of flies, Good place for healthy food if you can find something on the menu but if you have allergies the choices are limited.  The Ancient Grain Bowl I would go back for plus they have Key Lime Pie Yummy",

Our girls usually are stoked to have the Watermelon Lemonade with Almond Butter, Strawberry & Banana Sandwich.  I love the Kale Salad with chicken added.  And my wife tends to go for pretty much anything on the Pizza or Entrees menu that doesn't have mushrooms associated with it.  Service was the usual attentive standard we're used to.  The girl even had some hiragana tattooed behind her ear, allowing me to inconspicuously refresh my reading skills.  We'll be back, again.  I still need to try their juice bar options.",

It made me happy to see my parents enjoy such a good meal that was HEALTHY. The roasted veggies to start were also phenomenal. I don't live in AZ though and I was looking forward to being reunited with the edamame dumplings and they were out which really made me sad!

    "text": "I am not a fan of True Foods. I have eaten here twice, both times on the insistence of friends who love this place.   The restaurant is for me an awkward attempt at making something corporate more local and at making something more upscale more casual. The result is something in the middle that in my opinion doesn't really work. When our server tried to introduce us to the concept, when he first approached our table, it felt very corporate, forced, and fake.   The actual restaurant space is loud, so it is hard to have a conversation with anyone who isn't seated right next to you. On this last visit we had a table of six and it was very hard to hear everyone.   The first time I ate here I had the soup to start and a fish entree. The portions are small for the price.   On our most recent visit we started with the tofu lettuce wraps they have a very strong flavor. For dinner I had the bison burger, on the recommendation of our friends. It just wasn't for me. I didn't eat the top part of the bun. It was a little too dry and way too garlicky. The garlic might have also been in the sides. As a side I had half sweet potatoes and half kale. I usually like kale but this kale was really tough, hard to eat and hard to digest. There was nothing really wrong with the food I just didn't like it.   I order a glass-and-a-half of Rioja; I like that they serve the wine in this portion. It is a perfect amount to have with dinner. However, the wine itself wasn't something I would order again.    On both of our visits the service was slow. Be prepared for a drawn-out dinner.   Overall, True Foods isn't a place that I would personally recommend.",

Our table ordered the kale salad, delicious, fresh, great portion size!  We also had the dumplings with creamy edamame inside. Heavenly! We ordered the carrots cooked to perfection! I also tried their chipotle Bloody Mary... it's intense but midway through my drink I was sold! Finally we ordered the chocolate vegan cake with coconut ice cream cake. It  was out of this world! Clean and delicious comes to mind with this restaurant. Also this is a fox restaurant chain so if you work for any of their other restaurants you are eligible for a discount. I would definitely return when visiting Scottsdale!",

    "text": "Please indicate if the following points are True or False:  -   You and Matt were really excited to visit True Food Kitchen during Restaurant Week. TRUE  -   Upon arrival, the two of you were happy to be seated promptly without a reservation. TRUE  -   The cheerful restaurant decor infused you with organic, healthy, and sustainable vibes. TRUE  -  You and Matt really enjoyed sitting outdoors on the cozy patio that was artistically bordered with green grass. TRUE   -   The menu's variety of healthy and fresh options initially looked impressive and yummy. TRUE  -   It took your waiter about 10 minutes to acknowledge your existence after being seated, even though the restaurant wasn't very crowded. TRUE  -   When the waiter finally arrived, he didn't welcome you to the restaurant, introduce himself or even explain the concept behind the menu that Dr. Weil & Mr. Fox created. Instead he looked bored and just wanted to know your order. TRUE   -   Waiters at Applebee's have made a better first impression than he did. TRUE   -   The seasoned hummus appetizer, topped with a flavorful Mediterranean mix of Kalamata olives, cucumbers, feta and sliced pearl tomatoes impressed both of you. However the amount of time it took this dish to make its way to your table did not. TRUE  -  It seemed like the entire restaurant staff was playing a game of \"Guess Who?\" - waiters kept moronically walking around with food, stopping at different tables and trying to guess who ordered what. TRUE  -   At least 4 times (it occurred so frequently you stopped counting), a random waiter placed someone else's food in front of you, and you had to tell them that they guessed wrong. TRUE  -  You ordered a salad, tofu teriyaki bowl and frozen yogurt with berries. Matt ordered the smoked salmon, steak tacos and flourless chocolate cake. It was healthy, fresh and good but definitely NOT worth the $100+ bill including a bottle of wine. TRUE  -  You both felt robbed. A much more pleasant, faster and cheaper alternative would have been to buy the wine and ingredients from Trader Joes or Whole Foods and prepare this \"simple\" meal yourselves. TRUE  -  A snail could have cooked and served your \"simple\" meal faster then the 3 painstaking hours it took your waiter. TRUE  -  The restaurant's parking validation is only good for two free hours in the lot - but the wait staff decided to play that irritating game of \"Guess Who?\" and couldn't serve your \"simple\" meal in less than two hours - so to top it all off, you STILL had to pay for parking, which was beyond upsetting after so many other let downs. TRUE   -   Although you liked the decor and really wanted to love this restaurant, you don't recommend it to anyone since you have most certainly tasted MUCH better health food. TRUE  Thank you for your responses to these True Food Kitchen statements. We are excited for when you return to enjoy more of our overpriced food and overwhelmingly bad service. FALSE!!!",

I went over with some highly skeptical friends and one dinner was enough to convert them into believers! The food here is so good! We had the Shrimp dumplings and the Onion tart as starters. We ordered the Shirataki noodles and street tacos as entrees. So also ordered the Kale-aid. All of the dishes were yummy.  I have gone back many times since then and have never been disappointed! I have gone after yoga to get some Kale salad or the chicken chopped salad. I always have to get the Kale aid.  Once, a guy at the next table, uprooted a whole plant by mistake (on the patio) and was highly embarrassed as was his date! Ever since, I have very careful not to throw my arms around as I can be quite clumsy sometimes! I do NOT want to be banned from my favorite place for my clumsiness! I don't think I can live without True Food!",

The dishes we ordered (chili shrimp and fish tacos) were bland and unimaginative. The setting inside was sleek and the open kitchen idea is novel. The service was slow and forgettable. And since it is organic and fresh ingredients, the prices are a bit higher. I would not refuse to go back to TF, but I certainly would not recommend it.",

Plus, you will pay a premium and might not get enough to eat and you might not receive great service.  Based on my experience, I received poor service from the moment I walked in the entrance of True Food Kitchen.  The hostess was very rude and had an unpleasant and ugly attitude.  It was shocking to encounter a hostess at a restaurant at Biltmore Fashion Park with a nasty attitude.  The hostess had clearly not been trained about how to provide good hospitality.  She set the pace for the rest of the unpleasant dining experience.  A host or hostess should be pleasant, friendly, courteous, respectful and polite.  None of these qualities were exhibited by the hostess at True Food Kitchen.  I expressed my concerns with the manager and he did not seem very concerned about the issues.  It is very disappointing to visit a restaurant that seems like it should provide great service with good food and to encounter poor service instead.  It is not acceptable for a restaurant to charge a premium price for food and to offer substandard service.  I am not satisfied with the type of service I received and I want to let others know about it.  There are many other great restaurants you should try instead of this one.",

We went on a Monday night and it wasn't too busy.  We waited about 10 minutes for a table for 4.  They have some unique refreshments and we opted for The Natural and the Hangover Rx.  Between the two, the Hangover Rx was better...tasty.  We had the Hummus for an appetizer and it was VERY good...some of the best I've had outside of Haji Baba.  The pita's didn't hold a cancle to hand-made ones from Haji Baba or other middle eastern places, but they were good and fresh.  For a salad we split the Chicken Chopped salad...fantastic. and portioned appropriately...everything was fresh.  My wife ordered the steak tacos and I had the Panang Curry for our entrees.  Both were delicious.  The panang was surprisingly spicy for a restaurant curry (without asking my desired heat level) but I like it like that so it was perfect for me.  I don't normally like brown rice, but couldn't tell the difference in my dish...it was very, very good.  The restaurant boasts about fresh, sustainable and organic foods and you can tell...all the other dishes I saw coming out of the kitchen appeared that way as well.  I would have given 5 stars, but the service was a little slow for what appeared like a normal night that wasn't too busy.  It took longer than normal for our entrees I felt, especially when appetizer and salad came out almost immediately.  If they could fine tune service, it would be an even better dining experience.  When we come back to AZ again and looking for a fresh place to go, I'd definitely consider True Food again...and would recommend it to anyone.  Sorry, no desserts on this trip to speak of...too full.",

I was hesitant but, she wanted to try it and upon the glowing recommendations of the shop owner we were at previously and yelp we went. So here it goes:  Service: We were seated promptly and the hostess was nice enough. Our waiter was obviously bored. As soon as we sat down he began hanging over us asking our drink orders...we did need more than 2 seconds to scan the menu. Its great he was attentive and tried to be helpful, it was just a little much.   Atmosphere: Trendy and the music was LOUD. It was very clean.   Food: Small portions and unimpressive. We split the hummus which for its price should have been enough to share, but really was a build for one plate. The vegetables were good and crisp, the hummus was decent but was nothing special.  Ravioli with Pesto - Weird and boring. Apparently they usually put Red pepper and corn on top, which I can't really fathom as being good. It was okay, again nothing special, also small and pricey.   Drinks: Hangover RX - I didn't like this at all, and I believe it was $4?  Medicine Man - It reminded me of a watered down cranberry juice.  It had some flavor but, very light. $6.   We ended up spending $50 bucks for lunch, so plan to pay. In my opinion, this place isn't anything special, and its basically just reaping the benefits of the ongoing health trend.",

But this place does it right with local fresh ingredients and sustainable items.  Their menu changes seasonally and I am happy to say that the summer menu is as good as the winter one was.    We started with a glass of Tangent Pinot Grigio, which was perfect and was served in an ice bucket at our table side.  My buddy and I shared the watermelon and heirloom tomato salad and WOW.  Best and most interesting salad I have had in Phoenix, and I go out every night I am in Phoenix, which means three nights a week for the last year and a half.  My bud ordered the salmon, which she liked alot but still prefers the preparation they do in the winter months.  That didn't stop her from scarfing the whole thing down, though.  I had the halibut with Asian mushroom and eggplant.  The halibut was perfectly prepared and worth the $26 price tag (I told you it is pricey).  I loved the eggplant, the squash, and the sauce, but am not a fan of the mushrooms, which were too tough to cut and a bit of a disappointment.  I am still a bigger fan of the pan seared trout that I had last time I was here, and that is what I will get next time.  I am usually not a fresh water fish eater, but the preparation here is divine and I still dream about that darn fish.    My partner in crime insisted on ordering the flourless chocolate cake for dessert and the one bite I allowed myself was to die for.  It was swimming in warm caramel and topped with very rich vanilla ice cream.  DO NOT MISS THIS PLACE.  Truly fabulous.",

My husband had a really tasty Red Chili Shrimp dish, and my kids had healthy turkey burgers with (baked, not fried) sweet potato bits. They loved their homemade honey lemonade and grapefruit sodas. The hummus appetizer and gluten free pita were to die for. A must for gluten-free vegetarians!  I liked the open kitchen concept but the decor was a bit sterile and chain-y for my preferences (only reason I didn't give it a 5). I'd go back in a heartbeat.",

The bison burger is divine, I ordered it on the gluten free bun, they use udi's brand which are poor in texture and flavor but when I mentioned it to the server the manager swing by and offered us a complimentary dessert which was unexpected and much appreciated.  I'll go back but skip the gluten free bun next time.  Worth a trip just for the atmosphere and cool vibe.",

    "text": "I can't even begin to tell you how TRULY underwhelming this was, and for the price you pay for it, you're probably better off loading up on junk at the Whole Foods salad bar.   The folks who run True Food (and a handful of other non-related \"concept\" restaurants) are the kind of people I have a hard time taking seriously. If you believe so much in a product or a concept, I expect it to shine through your food and service. Instead, this was a streamlined operation with a perma-stoned spacey staff and the results were abysmal.   It's a shame that such a beautifully converted space (I can't believe this was that old Coffee Plantation) houses such mediocrity. I started my meal with the Tuscan kale salad. At first, I was very excited for this because it had been well over a year since I had seen any place in Arizona eve serve kale. The salad was simple- served with lemon juice, Parmesan, and bread crumbs, yet the lemon was so overpowering, it made the entire salad entirely too sour and bitter. The sea bass street tacos were a joke. Entirely overcooked and tasted way too fishy. Even the salsa and pickled onions couldn't mask the fishiness of this dish. The wild ahi sliders were fair-- perfectly seared, but lacked any depth of flavor. Thankfully, those didn't taste like it had been sitting out too long. We also got the sweet potato hash on the side...which was burnt on the bottom and tasted of smoke all the way through...I don't quite think they were meant to be that way though.  Got conned into ordering two juice infusion type things...not memorable at all. Opted out of dessert for all the obvious reasons.   The waitress bugged me so much. I don't know what hippie food co-op they dragged her out of, but if you're going to be a good waitress you probably should a) forget that you have tables and b) not look disgusted when your non-vegetarian customers order meat. The look on her face was more insulting to me than the meal itself, which is why I brought it down to two stars.   Care about selling customers your \"concept\" of quality, healthy foods?  Then SERVE quality, healthy foods.",

I asked if the spaghetti squash casserole had any onions, garlic or sugar.  The waitress checked for me and said it had onions and garlic in the sauce, but they could omit the onions.  I asked how much garlic they used and she was unable to give me an answer.  I asked if I could have the sauce on the side and she said sure.  My friend ordered the same dish without the modifications and hers was a good portion with melted cheese on top.  Mine was a small bowl of the squash (probably about 1.5 cups) with sauce on the side.  No cheese.  We had a limited amount of time, so I started eating my squash.  I tried the sauce, but it had way too much garlic.  When I was about half way through my \"meal\", the waitress checked on us and I mentioned the forgotten cheese.  She left and when I was about two bites from finishing my squash, she presented a small bowl of shredded cheese.  So I paid $13 for a small bowl of squash.",

    "text": "I wanted to love this place.  Really, I did.   I arrived early on a weekday, at 11 AM, to meet friends. The staff was busily preparing for the onslaught, and I was the first customer in the house. At that moment, it was peaceful and quiet. Then my friends arrived, along with a slew of other people, until there a pile of folks waited at the door.  I ordered a Medicine Man to drink, and it was yummy.  Once my friends arrived, we ordered an appetizer and our entrees. That's kind of where things went wrong.   The appetizer--edamame dumplings--was so fresh and organic, that it had a clump of somebody's dark hair tangled up in the daikon radish garnish. Yuck. Double yuck. That sort of put me off the dumplings, which I had already tasted and found delicious, but couldn't eat after discovering the hair. (I didn't mention the hair to my friends, as one wasn't eating the dumplings and the other had already eaten her share. I thought it reasonable that only one of us was thoroughly disgusted.)  I nervously awaited the entrees, wondering what surprises would be nestled inside my Mediterranean salad. Happily, the salad contained only fresh vegetables, nuts, and grilled chicken. No organic matter from another human being. I ate every bite, with no regrets. We even ordered dessert, and I inhaled a delicious, nutty banana-chocolate tart.  In the 1990s, while in graduate school, I ate once or twice a week at a Mexican restaurant in the Haight. They made a delicious veggie burrito that was to die for, and I was addicted until the day I tongued a very long dark hair that was rolled up inside my lunch. I never went back, and every so often, I think of that hair in the burrito and shudder a bit.  Would I eat at True Food again?  I'd like to say maybe, but there is the pesky  matter of The Hair. Just the thought of it grosses me out and sadly, eclipses the high points of the meal. I just don't recall Dr. Weil suggesting we eat human hair...",

The decor is very unique and trendy with an open kitchen and prep stations so you can see just how \"fresh\" your food is.  The hostess was friendly and it took about 10 minutes for our party of 3 to be seated on this busy Thursday night.  All 3 of us shared the Harvest Chopped Salad.  It was very tasty and served all of us quite nicely.  I would definitely order this salad again.  Our entrees (natural half chicken, sustainable salmon, and spaghetti squash spaghetti) were all very tasty and reasonably priced.  I would order any of the 3 again.  We did not order dessert this visit, but I would recommend the maple ice cream thing.  I had that last time and it was very good.  I think they make all the desserts from scratch because it took forever.  Anyway, the waiter was friendly and the food, drinks and refills were delivered rather quickly.

My wife's dish was a curry with the rice already mixed in that was like more of a soup.  The service and ambiance was the reason this place received a 3 star rating from me.  I did like the high ceilings and clean lively scene.",

From the Bison Burger, to the Spaghetti Squash casserole and even the Kale salad. It is so simple yet o good. They offer fresh squeezed juices and great cocktails.

Wish it had been a touch cooler, but it wasn't so we decided to eat indoors.    Had a little snafu with our servers where someone who was not our waiter took our drink orders, but it was straightened out pretty quickly.  We each ordered one of the signature drinks, the wife got cucumber lemonade (I think) and I got a green arnold palmer.  I liked the g.a.p.  For the meal, don't remember what the wife had, I got the chicken sausage pizza.  It was fine, nothing out of the ordinary.    Basically, that's how the whole meal was, okay, but didn't blow me away (not that I'm a huge healthy/organic foodie kind of guy though).  I guess I'd go here again, but I probably wouldn't suggest it.  (I did think the music was a little loud...)",

They have a nice selection of refreshing beverages, particularly liked the Medicine Man with Pomegranate juice, blueberries & black tea. Everything had a satisfying taste,  yet you didn't feel uncomfortably full. We were seated at a long wooden dining table, with unique extras - like the dish towel napkins and fun chairs. The decor is terrific - high ceilings, great wall colors, over sized unique light fixtures.  The dinner team from hostesses, to wait staff and kitchen support all have great complimentary outfits - working as a one unit, which translates to quick, efficient customer service. The acoustics do not allow for a intimate conversations, the atmosphere is open and has a good energy buzz. Another nice showing for the Fox restaurant group.",

The drinks/elixirs may sound like medicine but they were very tasty, especially the ginger one (and I LOVE ginger!). We had the onion tart for the appetizer and it was a wonderful taste explosion in my mouth. For dinner we ordered the squash casserole and the bison burger. With the 2 drinks, we got out of there for about $60 which is a bit pricey but so worth it considering the taste, quality and service.",

Our server Tyler didn't really pay attention to us (lots of awkward eye contact, like oh shit I forgot about you guys), and no offers to refill drinks. The close proximity of tables can make one feel claustrophobic. My girl friend ordered the curry and commented that she felt something was missing afterwards. Come to find the rice was missing. When we informed our waiter, his reply was simply \"sorry about that I will let the kitchen know.\" $14 for an incomplete meal!!!! Not to mention the vegetables were semi-raw still (but maybe that's a \"True\" thing).",

    "text": "I had been dying to try True Food Kitchen for a while now, after seeing reviews on it on various people's \"Vegetarian\" lists. I was even more psyched to see that it not only is close to where I live, but also took the place of that awful Coffee Plantation spot in the Biltmore! Yay!  I went with my somewhat reluctant meat-eating boyfriend, but he was quickly won over with their expansive alcohol menu and their plethora of meat dishes- all either local or organic. A place we can both agree on!  I ordered the honey lemonade ($3) which was the perfect balance between tart and sweet-- honey is a great sweetener! I was brought a refill just when my glass became less than half full-- bonus!  We also ordered the hummus appetizer (~$8), which we both enjoyed immensely. My boyfriend liked the tart olives and feta cheese, whereas I loved the cucumbers! There was more hummus left over as our pita bread slices dwindled, but that just means we loaded up our pieces!  For my main course, I had the TLT (Tempeh, Lettuce, and Tomato) ($9), which I really enjoyed. The tempeh was pretty crunchy, but it was balanced by the smooth avocado slices. The boyfriend ordered the Organic Ravioli with Ricotta cheese and kale pesto (~$13), which was super good! It came with 6 pieces of ravioli, which he thought was not enough at first, but after he cleaned his plate he said he was \"stuffed.\" Good sign!! The plate also comes with a ton of meaty mushrooms, which made it even better in my opinion.   We definitely did not have room for dessert, but I've heard mixed reviews of the desserts so I'm not sure if that's something we'll end up trying. Our server was extremely attentive to us, did not pressure us into ordering anything extra, and was prompt in refilling water glasses, answering questions, and bringing the check.  The atmosphere is interesting- a mix of well-dressed business and retired people (think: khaki pants, button up shirts, sweater vests (in the winter); nurses just off work; people coming in for happy hour (jeans and nice shirts); and people just in off the street (shorts, casual shirts, even hats). I really liked this ambiance, because it doesn't make it too stuffy and turn people \"off\" of this locally grown, organic restaurant concept.  We would definitely be back in a heartbeat, but the only reason I marked it down was because we were sitting underneath their funky lights, and a spider fell out of the light on to my boyfriend's arm. He wasn't terribly bothered by it (other than 'wtf, why is there a spider on my arm?') but I would have freaked out. So... don't sit under the lights, if you can help it!",

We ordered the Greek frittata and the chicken hash. The frittata was OK, and the hash was very good. Maybe too much squash in the hash...   We finished off our brunch with a single blueberry johnnie cake that was pretty awesome and was only 2 bucks forth single cake. Very tasty.

However, this visit fell short of my expectations.   My friend and I came here to enjoy dinner together. Seating was prompt. Drinks were ordered and arrived swiftly, at which point we ordered the entire meal (including an appetizer). We ordered the shrimp dumplings as our appetizer, I ordered the salmon open-faced sandwich, and he ordered a curry dish with shrimp. Much to our surprise, 10 minutes later, our entrees arrive. I asked the server where our appetizer was, he said he would go check. A minute later, our waitress shows up and says she FORGOT to put in the order for the dumplings. She had a pad and pen with which she was writing down the order, was she not listening? We still wanted them, and they were ordered. The manager promptly came to apologize for the error and corrected it. Other than this incident, service was pretty good.   My food was good, but not something that merits an \"excellent\" rating. I reserve \"rave reviews\" for food that is creative and tasty. The salmon was cooked well (under-seasoned, but nonetheless well done). My kale salad and sweet potato hash were de-lish! My friend said that he enjoyed the curry. Booze wise, I had the Fudo Myoo Sake which was quite tasty, and my friend had a cocktail with strawberry juice in it which was delicious. We were offered a dessert menu, but both of us were full. Price points were decent here with most entrees falling in the $13 - 14 range and appetizers in the $8-10 range. Wines and cocktails are also priced at a variety of points.   Overall TFK is a good mid-range restaurant with a good corporate social responsibility stance, and I liked it, but again, it's not something that I would rate \"excellent\".   And (drumroll) Grades:  Overall:    C   (the actual average would be a C+, however, I am                         doubling the impact of the service grade. Otherwise,                         no demerits taken)  Service:   C-   (the fact that the server forgot to write down our order                          is a major problem. Hopefully it's a once-in-a-great-while                         kind of incident. The only thing that salvaged the service                         grade to above a failure was the manager's quick action)  Food:       B-  (it's good, but nothing to write home about. Plus points                        for a well-executed sweet potato hash and kale salad)  Drinks:     B   (Tasty strawberry cocktail - which tasted a bit watery to                        me, but otherwise good. Sake was pretty good too)",

The food was enjoyable - though, nothing that can't be easily replicated at home after a quick stop at Whole Foods.  My biggest issue is that True Foods is way, way, way OVERRPRICED for what you are getting.  There is nothing truly special here to merit the cost of the meal - you'll likely enjoy whatever you order, but you will also leave with a nagging feeling that you got fleeced...",

We had the edamame dumplings with had a smooth texture on the inside and was in a nice broth with some savory smoky flavors. I recommend them for sure to start. We also had the kale guacamole which was delicious and will satisfy even those who hate kale. The chips they come with are nice and crunchy with a good sturdiness to pick up a lot of guacamole in one go. For entree, we got the grilled chicken salad and the pan roasted chicken, both were excellent! I plan on becoming a regular here.",

As my server and I were talking I mentioned I didn't like drinks that were too sweet. She noticed I wasn't drinking my tea and asked if it was too sweet... it was for me so she brought me a flight of different drinks based on my preferred flavors! AwEsOmE service! I ended up liking a drink i otherwise wouldn't have tried. I had a great time trying all the different drinks. :) Kombucha, cranberry pomegranate, ginger honey lemon (the natural)... the Kombucha and the natural were my favorites. The best part is that you could always customize the sweetness.. light or sans honey :)",

    "text": "BACKGROUND   True Food Kitchen is one of the greatest success stories in the history of the food and restaurant industry.  TRUE FOOD KITCHEN: THE HISTORY   The history of True Food Kitchen started in Tucson in the late 1990's, when Dr. Andrew Weil met with Phoenix restaurateur Sam Fox. Dr. Weil was adamant about making restaurants available that not only adhered to his anti-inflammatory diet, but would demonstrate how delicious healthy food can be, as well as having an environmental awareness, all in an inviting atmosphere.  Dr. Weil's anti-inflammatory diet is not a \"diet\" per se, but is based on the staggering evidence that chronic inflammation is the root cause of many chronic illnesses, including heart disease, many cancers and Alzheimer's disease. This is also the concept behind anti-aging medicine.  If you are unfamiliar with this concept, definitely check out <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fdrweil.com&s=be1f5fd353bc10f9e5d055c681f1f3eb984895e38f700c8dc9b8b141345fdaec\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">drweil.com</a> for more information, and for the anti-inflammatory diet specifically:  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.drweil.com%2Fdrw%2Fu%2FART02012%2Fanti-inflammatory-diet&s=dfbeac1322191ce8f915816bb6e428e3975aa1408178043a98232e3a4f700e27\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">drweil.com/drw/u/ART0201...</a>   True Food is currently in 9 states: AZ, CA, CO, GA, IL, NY, TN, TX, VA  There are two locations in Phoenix: Biltmore  Kierland Commons  Although there are now many locations, True Food Kitchen has a commitment to the community and will never become a \"chain\" type restaurant.   THE MENU  The menu is a work of art. Dishes are influenced by Mediterranean, Asian, and Californian cuisine, and include breakfast, soups, appetizers, salads, pastas, rice and noodle dishes, wood grilled dishes, sandwiches, burgers, brick oven pizzas and desserts.  CONCLUSION   I recently ate at the Biltmore location for brunch. I had the huevos rancheros with fresh corn tortillas and bottomless mimosas. The food was scrumptious and the staff was delightful. (see pic)  5/5 RECOMMEND   OF NOTE  *True Food Kitchen always uses local, organic sources when possible.  *True Food Kitchen is also decidedly \"green\" with many environmentally friendly accoutrements.   *Hours: Mon - Thurs: 11am - 9pm Fri: 11am - 10pm Sat: 10am - 10pm Sun: 10am - 9pm  *Valet parking is available. If you self park, be sure to ask for ticket validation.  *For more information: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.Truefoodkitchen.com&s=47edf747ff255927c1c4fbda26c7e463762aef8ecdccb0c05d4a0737945ba913\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Truefoodkitchen.com</a>",

Also had the Moroccon chicken was out of this world. I was very surprised to see this flavor profile on the menu but they nailed it. The mission fig was the nice addition to balance the spice.

Kaylee was especially helpful with suggesting items and letting us know what was special to their menu at this time. Paul the GM is an amazing person and has made sure my wife and I were well taken care of over the past few months. We really enjoy eating all the organic and healthy options at True Food. Alex is also very friendly and does well with helping to manage the restaurant. We will be back over and over! I would highly recommend anyone looking for a good bite to stop and try True food. I would give more stars if I could.",

    "text": "No more than two weeks after my virginal visit to True Food Kitchen in Walnut Creek, I found myself looking for a healthy dinner in the Biltmore Fashion Park shopping center in Phoenix, and lo and behold, here was another True Food Kitchen. Little did I know this was the original one founded by alternative medicine guru Andrew Weil who based the menu on an \"anti-inflammatory food pyramid'. I don't know what the hell that means but that high-falutin' approach translates into a heavily vegetarian/vegan menu which was fine by me. I played it safe the first time by ordering Heirloom Tomatoes & Watermelon and Spaghetti Squash Casserole (no cheese please) and was quite satisfied (review: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2zOmRJs&s=c1f64cbf44efc41403a5825ea0943e3169dd4b3b34bd75cf71bd01614669718d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2zOmRJs</a>).  This time I felt a bit more audacious and first ordered the $9 Edamame Dumplings, which were surprisingly savory since they contained just dashi, white truffle oil, and Asian herbs to go along with the smashed soybeans. The meltably tasty wrappers helped add to the satisfaction of the rather soupy dish (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2yQGY9H&s=f0607a0dd7a1632e5b8397006efc73c46b4331e217db88c3dec70fb167015cff\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2yQGY9H</a>). To complete my dinner, I went with the $10 Shiitake Lettuce Cups. The filling was, well, filling as it combined tofu, jicama, sambal, Thai basil, and cashew into a substantial mound of flavor easily scoopable (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2hiRds1&s=4aa7a5b8c638361d40ac84694043f653355211da50e601fe9dbbf849d57552a9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2hiRds1</a>). I just thought it rather odd that they presented long Romaine lettuce leaves as the wrappers as they aren't naturally grabble and cuppable like good ol' deconstructed iceberg wedges (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2AzWKmt&s=f978002dcab9fb5ef62ca1cc936b19fa5ca14b4ab14f3c58b7a09ceee1b7ef06\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2AzWKmt</a>).  It was still tasty, but I misjudged the ratio of filling to lettuce leaf and had too much filling left. Not a bad problem because it was good all by itself, almost like a moo shu pork without the pork. Frankly all the dishes sound good here. Healthy too with a bit of an Asian accent on a lot of them like Teriyaki Quinoa and Spicy Panang Curry. The salads looked appetizing as they passed by, especially the $14 one that featured seasonal ingredients like asparagus and broccolini. The place was pretty packed for a weeknight with fit and aspiring-to-be-fit Phoenicians. No matter what end of the food pyramid I was eating, I just like what Dr. Weil has attempted to do here since the menu combines healthy and tasty in a refreshing way.  FOOD - 4 stars...tasty and healthy on the same plate is always a good thing AMBIANCE - 4 stars...spacious if a bit loud, even the counter allows for elbow room SERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty attentive considering the flow of diners coming in and out TOTAL - 4 stars...truly True food indeed",

We were a little bit chilly so we asked our hostess if she could turn on one of the overhead heaters. She replied telling us that they are on a timer with the Biltmore being in charge of that said timer. We shrugged it off and were just going to deal with it. Until another customer asked a different hostess if she could do this same task and she happily obliged. We then asked our server the hostesses name, Jane, and then asked if what she had told us is True which it's not. And then as we were leaving Jane proceeded to laugh at us. Truly unprofessional, immature, and lazy. Bad for business.     Once again aside from this I've had pretty good experiences.",

I asked for greens to replace the rice but I just got a huge portion of ginger.  Not ideal but the food was great even without and filler.  Interesting combo of mushrooms, avocado, cucumber, tuna, and some radish/beet type veggie.  Interesting but tasty.  My friend ordered the pad Thai and it was delish!  It was spicy, hot, and very flavorful.  For drinks - she got the Bloody Mary (she said good, unique, and not a normal/average one but tasty), and I got the honeydew sparkler which was refreshing, mildly sweet, and a little spicy from the ginger.

    "text": "I went to True Food Kitchen in the Scottsdale Quarter with Business Associates last Saturday.  I had an absolutely horrible experience.    The servers were not friendly, in fact, they were \"pushy\".  It appeared that they wanted to rush us out of the place when we had a large party.  If anything they should have been over accomodating to our party.  The staff was already rushing our dishes out to us and we had not even finished our salads and appetizers.  When the food did arrive it was not hot.  I ordered the trout which included brocolli and califlower.  I should have immediately sent my dish back but instead I \"caved in\" to the staff's desire to rush our table.    As it turns out this was a huge mistake.   I became violently ill by the time that I got home.   My Doctor indicated that I had contracted a severe bacterial infection which my Doctor thought in all likelihood was from \"undercooked\" fish or the brocolli or califlower not being properly handled.  My Doctor indicated from blood tests that the bacterial infection was definitely the result of food poisoning.  It is now Wednesday, 4 days after I was at True Food Kitchen and the bacterial infection is just now starting to clear.  True Food Kitchen has lost a customer for life.  Dr. Weill, you have a lot of work to do if you expect your trendy, upscale, organic restaurants to survive.  John",

    "text": "This is one of the best restaurants I've ever been to- hands down!  I went with a party of six and here is what was ordered:  Normally we don't order appetizers, but we were starving so we started with the local vegetable crudites.  This was so beautiful!  It was a HUGE bowl of just gorgeous raw veggies (bright green lettuce, purple carrots, large slices of crispy cucumbers, etc.) and two dips- tzatziki (not vegan) and black olive (vegan and the most delicious dip I have ever had).  Here are the entrees:   Me: I wanted to order the curry, but was disappointed to find out that the sauce had shrimp paste in it so I couldn't have it :(  So instead I ordered the Teriyaki brown rice bowl with tofu.  It was simple, yet delicious.  I would have liked to order something a little more exotic/adventurous, but when you are vegan sometimes your choices are limited.   Husband/Sister-in-law/Her boyfriend: It was highly recommended that the Spaghetti squash casserole be ordered, so three members of our party did just that.  My husband veganized his by excluding the mozzarella.  I stole a bite and it was wonderful!  Everyone who ordered this was very satisfied.    Father-in-law:  Shaved turkey sandwich with sweet potato hash.    Mother-in-law: Turkey bolognese.  Everyone raved about their meal and there was a lot of shared bites going around.  However, I had looked at the dessert menu previously and couldn't get my mind off the Strawberry rhubarb crisp with a side of ice cream.  This was the only vegan dessert on the menu, and if you've read any of my other posts you know that if there is vegan dessert offered, it's bound to be in my belly!    We ALL ordered this dessert and OMG I seriously can't stop raving/thinking about it.  I could eat this everyday.  It was so unbelievably delicious.  When I get home from Scottsdale (to Southern California) I am going back to just have this dessert.    This restaurant is a MUST TRY for herbivores and omnivores alike.  A great place to go with a large group!",

I was kinda scared of the menu because I typically eat 'bland with bland and a side of bland'. I ordered the turkey pita (not sure the official name) with a side kale salad. I skipped out of the provolone, which made the sandwich a little dry, but it was still really yummy. The kale salad was a big surprise....I liked it alot and had never tried kale before! My sister ordered the terriaki tofu. Her only complaint was that there wasn't enough actual tofu in her dish. I will definitely go back. Next time, I want to try one of their yummy drinks!",

    "text": "I always love going to hippy-dippy places that use organic ingredients and choose to fry free range animals.  (If you grew up in Boulder, Colorado, you might likely feel similarly.)  This is essentially the story behind True Food, though I don't believe anything is fried, per se.  Quite a few people at about 6 p.m. on a Sunday evening -- waited 20 minutes.  Ate the green tea soba noodles, quite satisfactory; my mom had the turkey burger and sweet potato hash, which she liked, while my aunt had a wild shrimp, onion and goat cheese pizza which apparently was okay.  Couple notes: the tables in the restaurant are situated quite closely together, which makes it prone to traffic jams (however I did see one guest in a wheelchair navigate relatively easily), and the space is a bit loud and according to my mother, \"the chairs don't accommodate one with an ample behind very well.\"  Oh Mom, that's the media telling you your behind is ample.  But perhaps places like this restaurant are trying to combat that.  True Food was pretty alright -- I loved that the hostess' station was covered in fake grass.",

    "text": "True Food was the most recent of my new lunch spots to try.  Very cool environment inside with kind of the \"green\" concept.  Everything, or atleast I think everything, is locally grown, organic type food.  You kinda have a healthy feeling in there.  I ordered the Sashimi Tuna salad which was fantastic.  They are very generous on the tuna as you get some with every bite until the end.  It is also filled with cucumbers, edamames, tomato, avacado, and ginger dressing.  I'm not sure if it was healthy but it felt healthy for some reason.     The staff was very friendly and the decor is pretty neat.  Its a very open space and I think they even have some community seating in the front.  I happen to sit at the bar where you could watch them make fresh \"Natural Refreshments\" as they call them.  As nice as everyone was they do have some kinks to work out as all new establishments do.  I ordered a hot green tea and the server was very excited to take my order.  About 3 minutes later she came back and said she didnt forget about the tea she was just waiting on a tea pot?  I was a lil confused?  Did they not order enough tea pots when they opened?  Couldnt she just make it and put it in some other glass?  I mean tea is just a tea bag and some hot water right?  I didnt suggest these ideas to her so i just patiently waited.  About 20 minutes later after i had finished my salad I said \"Do you have the tea?\" She was still waiting for a tea pot and replied with a smile, \"I didn't forget about you Im still waiting for the tea pots.  They are going through storage in the back and getting some cleaned up for you.\"  I thought to myself, \"okkkk\".  In the end, I did get my green tea.  However, I never got it in the pot.  She put it in a to go cup for me in which the lid didnt really fit.  Why she didnt do that to begin with so i could enjoy the tea with my meal was beyond me.  HAAA!!  Bottom line- Good food!  Everything i saw go by smelled and looked very good.  Just ask if they have tea pots BEFORE you order your hot tea.  Cool decor!  Oh! and definitly go to the bathroom.  Cool waterless urinals which they tell you saves 40,000 gallons of water a year and cool powerful eco-friendly hand dryers!",

I walked into the men's room as one of the cooks (shorter guy with a beard) was finishing at the urinal, when he finished, he walked out without washing his hands! Out of the corner of my eye a second cook who was in the stall walked out of the stall and also did not wash his hands! Gross! I pointed it out to our waiter and he said he would say something to the one person whom I was able to recognize and I opted to not have him say anything (for obvious reasons). The waiter offered that they have a hand washing station near the kitchen and the gentlemen probably washed their hands there....I'm not buying it. I know I may be somewhat of a germaphobe but that is inexcusable for a chef who is making salads and things which are not cooked to do something like this...furthermore, it is a major health code violation!

    "text": "I have been to True Food 3 times now and i am very impressed. first of all the decor is bright, airy, and environmentally responsible with reclaimed wood floors and those awesome dyson hand dryers in the bathrooms. filtered water is brought to the table in reusable glass bottles.  why people have written that they dont like to watch the food being prepped on the open table confuses me. some of the best kitchens in the world have an open kitchen and watching chefs prep beautiful fruits and vegetables shows me how much they care about the quality of their produce. Now to the food- the only time i have ever heard of olivelo juice and it was delicious. so was the green ice tea and the cucumber refresher. i have had over half the menu and even the tempeh tlt which i thought  might be too healthy turned out to be Delicious. the soba noodles , shrimp dumplings and local vegetables were really fresh and tasty. loved the kale salad and the green tea soba noodles. turkey burger was very nice and i didnt miss not having beef. Overall i like the eclectic mix on the menu and i can always find something i am in the mood for. I highly recommend giving this place a try. I will be eating here every week.",

I love this restaurant for the casual vibe and healthy food. My favorite dishes are the Edamame Dumplings and the Miso Glazed Black Cod. It was often hard to get out of work for lunch, so coming to True Foods at the end of the day was always a treat.   I only wish they had one in San Francisco!",

Positives- the hummus- I love hummus and this is the best I have had so far. Now that is saying a lot because I love the hummus at Pita Jungle and I never thought I would ever dethrone their dish, but alas I have. Be forewarned it is very garlicky!( Probably why I love it so much!)  I had the shrimp dumplings and shaved turkey sandwich with Sweet Potato Hash( bland) . It was good but nothing to write home about. They have funny non alcoholic drinks with cute names that my friends say are great though I did not have one.( NOjito for no alcohol Mojito-funny!) I would say check it out but be forewarned it is a bit BILTMORE STUFFY for an average Joe or Josephine and it is very expensive. The service was outstanding. At one point I had 5 servers waiting on me at once. Some people do not like that, but I sure do!!",

Our server was very knowledgable about the items on the menu, and gave my husband the advice of trying to \"half portions\" of the asian dishes he was debating between.  Turns out the half portions are HUGE.  He took almost a whole one home.  The teriyaki was a little bit too salty for my taste, but I thought the curry dish was excellent.  I had the steak tacos adn I thought they were also very well done.  The men at the table next to us ordered some hot sauce to go along with theirs, and I think I'll do that next time too.  I'll definitely be coming back here, especially when my sister is in town because they have a variety of gluten free menu items.",

WOW!! hands down the BEST burger in phoenix, juicy, always cooked to perfection, the flavors dance together in your mouth and you will want more!  initially i thought it would be kind of gamey, and never measure up to the likes of delux, the grind, maizie's, rocket burger, chelsea's kitchen and others, but amazingly i was blown away & it is a weekly staple for my man! desserts are also fresh, innovative & tantalizing. i have been eyeballing their brunch menu & am looking forward to trying it soon - overall - GO you will love it!",

    "text": "I had very high expectations for this place since I had heard so many good things about it before coming so I was pretty disappointed since my experiences definitely were nothing to get overly excited about.   I went the first time with a friend who had the ahi sliders which I have to say were quite good. I had ordered one of their pizzas which was OK but pretty average. I just chalked this up to this restaurant not really being the best place to order pizza.   The next time I went, I thought, I'll get the ahi sliders since they were so tasty last time. Well, this time was completely the opposite. The tuna had a much fishier smell this time and the bun was all soggy. It seemed like the sandwich had been sitting out for awhile before I even got it. It was so bad I could only manage to eat half a slider. I was considering sending my order back but no one ever asked me if I liked my food. By the time someone had come by to check up on us, I had already resigned myself to the fact that I was going to have to eat a snack once I got home.  On a side note, the sliders came with sweet potato hash as a side. When I asked if I could substitute the side, I was told that I could only have the kale salad. This didn't really make sense to me since even though there were several other sides that were the same price as the sweet potato hash, I was told that these weren't available as substitutions. The worst part about it was I ended up getting the kale salad and it was so garlicky that I could hardly eat that either.  Too bad... I like the idea of healthy, fresh food but not at the expense of flavor and mediocre service.",

I was on a gluten free food trial and saw the mushroom pizza on the menu which can be made gluten free.  I sat at the bar even though the patio was very inviting. The bar was awesome and I felt like it was my mother ship! I could see all the fresh fruit, veggies and juices. The bartender was sending out all sorts of things from beer and wine to delicious looking cocktails.  I ordered a gluten free cider and the pizza and it might just be the best pizza I've ever had. I made myself only eat half so I could finish it on the drive back to Tucson- that didn't pan out so well. I think I made it to chandler bf I had to finish it!

    "text": "True Food Kitchen indeed serves the most True and delicious foods in their beautiful open kitchen.   The restaurant is simply picturesque and is how I would love my future kitchen to look like. It's new country chic, first page worthy of a True food recipe book, and perfectly complements their healthy menu items.   We started off with a couple of cocktails: \"Acai & Apricot\" and \"Cherry Bourbon Sour\". The thing about their fresh juices and cocktails is that you won't regret it with whatever you decide on. They're all amazing! However, this time we visited, the Cherry Bourbon Sour was a bit too sour without any tint of cherry bourbon so we told the server and the restaurant manager personally remade the drink himself and also brought the \"Ginger Margarita\" for us to try as if he read my mind! Needless to say, their service is excellent and they try their utmost best to serve high quality food and drinks.   My husband ordered the \"Grass-Fed Bison Burger\", which was the size of the moon and very tasty. It comes with a side of kale or sweet potatoes or you could ask for a little bit of both! Then I ordered the Panang Curry with chicken and I must say, ever since I tried their Panang Curry, I can't get it anywhere else. Their Panang Curry is very well-balanced with fresh vegetables and filled with so much flavor that will rock. your. world.   I haven't tried their brunch so I'll be visiting again soon for that!!",

I need to stay away from food that inflame and True food is just the place for that. I love the crudite which is basically just blanched veggies with yummy dipping sauces. It was a little disappointing that the sauces that now come with it are oh so small where as they used to be much bigger. We also had the quinoia bowl with steak and it had some sort of delicious glazed sweet potatoes, and yes I will now crave that and need to drive to phoenix. Overall True food is  very yummy but in all reality is a bit overpriced for what it is but thats expected with sam fox restaurants right? You're mostly paying for the uber hipster staff and trendy environment?!",

I love the vegetarian options here and it doesn't make me feel like I'm cheating on my healthy eating habits. It isn't a perfect whole foods menu (they have things like pasta and bread and pizza) but lots of the menu items are vegetable centered and many things can be made GF.   Service was phenomenal. The waiter was attentive, food was out quickly, and a manager stopped by to ask how our meal was. You always get an A in service from me if a manager is going around checking on customers!  I got the quinoa burger (still on my quest for the best veggie burger in PHX) and the flavor combinations were amazing. The burger was definitely a messy, eat-with-a-fork-not-your-hands sort of thing, but it was so good I didn't care. It came with a side of sweet potato hash, which was sort of cold, and a kale salad, which was also sort of cold, but tasted much better.   The place got busier as we ate, so the earlier you go the better if you don't want a wait. I think next time I'll try eating at the bar and get something off the drink menu, lots of interesting alcoholic options!",

We are usually okay with the slow service because it gives me time to enjoy my two favorite things. But, sometimes it will test my patience.  On to my favorites: First, the appetizer, which in my case is always the Crudites.  It is basically a massive bowl of raw vegetables served over ice.  It does not sound exciting but it is the most gorgeous bowl of raw vegetables that you will ever see!  The veggies are seasonal, so they vary, and often they will include something unrecognizable, yet vibrantly purple, and it's just not often enough in life that I get to think, \"Hmm, what is this purple thing I am putting in my mouth?\"  My second favorite thing is some fabulous drink called the Skinny Cucumber Citrus Margarita. Since it is \"skinny\" and since there is plenty of time before the food arrives, you can drink two of these drinks. Or three, if you are a little crazy and not driving.  It is muddled cucumber, oranges and mint (heck, this makes it almost healthy!) and topped with a little carbonation.  It is just so good, I wish I was drinking one right now. My husband always gets a beer, feels a little disappointed when it comes out of a can, but then likes it and orders a second, too.  The food is good  and the menu is seasonal.  The kids' pizza is HUGE but all the adult servings are normal.  The kale salad that comes with the burgers is best if it is taken in the same bite as the sweet potato hash (that also comes on the side). The sweetness helps cut the bitterness.  The waiters are cute and I recommend sitting outside!",

After the bounty of crudites we shared at the table.....3 out of 8 slices was plenty for a light meal! Lunch leftovers = score!  Waiter was very knowledgeable and excited about the menu, which was a nice change from the norm. Great, earthy iced tea but over-priced for something that costs about 26 cents to produce  :P",

Let me start by applauding their separation from Sam Fox, the Chef Boyardee of overpriced cardboard.  Maybe they will find genuine inspiration and give the audience something more original and exciting.  I've had the grass fed burger, which is pretty good - served with parmesan, mushroom and caramelized onions.  But so is anything with parmesan, mushroom and caramelized onions.  I may be willing to eat tree bark covered in that.  So it's not exciting.  Neither is the Inside Out Burger, which is in no relation to the movie Inside Out nor a distant cousin of In N Out Burger.  No - this is high-falutin, grade A health movement swill.  Come to think of it, I was a little depressed after eating it, so maybe there is a hint of Pixar in it.  The Poke bowls, again, are Yardhouse quality re-branded as the latest Keto/Paleo/Rowan Atkinson/Richard Simmons catering health food.  They are good, but even better because the health nuts have a Mecca to pray at while they eat the Yardhouse food.  True Food Kitchen is the leader of the Dadaist movement on health food.  They have taken the artistic works of so many great restaurants and put a mustache across them, hoping you will eat mustache \"because, you know, it's healthy for you.\"  But don't look for originality.",

The only negative thing I can say is that it's more on the pricey side. You won't find something that you will really want to eat under $14 including salads. If you want to add any meat/tofu/fish it costs extra. Nothing comes with the standard salads so you would have to add something if you want but the quality of the food is great so you get what you pay for.",

And I must say everything we tasted was super delicious!   The atmosphere was a nice site to see; open concept with lots of seating inside and out. I was told there a smaller room near the pack for small parties. But I just loved how open the space was with high ceilings. And the place always is busy! Luckily our dinner around 8 PM was too busy and got a seat right away. You can see into the kitchen and work area of the workers, which made it seem like a place you can learn cooking or you're on a cooking show!  For starters, a friend recommended the shiitake lettuce cups, and it was amazing! There was some spice to it, but we devoured the bowls. The mix was Shiitake mushrooms, jicama, sambal, cashews, and Thai basil -- served with an unlimited bowl of lettuce cups/leaves.  I ordered the lasagna bolognese -- fennel chicken sausage, mushrooms, spinach, lemon ricotta, herbs, and accompanied by marinara sauce. My food was gone in a flash -- another amazing dish. My friend ordered the Inside Out Quinoa burger which, instead of buns, used two dense quinoa patties.   It's a must try and see restaurant! Definitely worth the price and atmosphere!",

And if that's what you value in a restaurant then this place gets 5 stars all day. Tasty food - delicious, really. Friendly staff, cool ambiance - you're fine in a t-shirt or sports jacket. I get the vegan pizza every time, and as far as vegan pizzas go, this is one of the best. Great, memorable flavors ensure this is always part of my order. Everything else is good but can be a little underwhelming.   If you're vegan you need to order the vegan key lime pie. It's stupid good",

I was so happy to see they put the vegan butternut squash pizza back on the fall menu. It is quite possibly my favorite pizza in town (aside from Bianco's). The vegan ricotta is amazing and the squash crisps up like bacon. It is so good!  The problems we usually have here are seating and service. You have the choice of eating inside, where it is just too loud (especially for my 80 year old mother-in-law) or outside on the patio where it is too hot for 90% of the year. This visit, we tried the patio since it was under 100 degrees out. But, the sun was blazing on our table and the sunshade didn't help much. Our server was very slow in getting to us so I had to find the host to ask for water and to adjust the shade. When the water arrived, there was no ice and we had to ask for it twice before getting it. The server wasn't familiar enough with the menu to answer some of our questions with confidence so some folks at our table got frustrated. She did comp us two deserts though (I had a coupon for one). The food was great, but the overall experience left room for improvement. It's a shame they can't muffle the noise more inside!",

I've had a number of the dishes from their bowls, panang curry, salads and even their pizzas. I don't think I've ever been disappointed. Everything is usually very consistent and the service is good too. The foods are supposedly healthy and really align with what I stand for. I guess by expectations have been changed and I now hold restaurants to a higher standard. The most recent time I went some of my veggies were a little too charred and it left a bitter taste in my mouth. On some occasions I have felt the food just wasn't to my taste. I guess I've become much pickier because I probably would have given it 5 stars if it were last year, however I would prefer continuous consistency to give that rating now. The experience here is overall quite nice, though I would suggest sitting outside since the inside is quite loud. I think it's a safe bet to eat here and I enjoy it as long as it's not too busy.",

If all you ate was a salad and water, definitely 5 stars, but if you are bringing a family of 4 and get a glass of wine, you better be prepared for the shock on the sticker price! Margarita pizza is nice, but nothing to write home about. Size matters, and again wish they offered more for the money! The sweet point of value for money has passed, and perhaps they need to get back to analyzing their cost/customer satisfaction model.",

    "text": "I travel to AZ from the East Coast twice a year. After the long flight, we stop for bite to eat. We selected True Food Kitchen for both visits in 2017.  A True Food Kitchen opened in King of Prussia, PA (KOP) just this past month.  I visited it recently as well.    It was lunch time and they were very busy. We were warmly greeted and seated quickly.  The server was welcoming. The service was good. The food is always wonderful.  Although there are many wonderful selections on the menu, Mom always gets the spaghetti squash casserole.  She loves it! I ordered the Inside Out Quinoa Burger. It's wonderful with a side of their amazing kale salad. Seriously, it's very very good. Dad ordered the burger and enjoyed every bite.    What I thought was remarkable, was the difference between my Quinoa Burger in King of Prussia, Pa and that of the one in Phoenix, AZ.  The Phoenix Burger was 2-3 times the size of the KOP burger. Kudos to Phoenix.  Clearly, KOP's location has to match up to the True Kitchen standards of Phoenix.    We've appreciated Dr. Andrew Weil for years. We're thrilled to know we can go out for a bite and know we're truly getting food that is good for us! Beverages too!",

I could go on and on about every dish, dessert, and drink that we ordered.  The staff was incredibly accommodating and knowledgeable.

    "text": "True Food has an interesting concept of including a \"superfood\" with every dish. I ordered a Penang curry, and I guess the superfood in it was coconut milk? I'm not sure. It comes with three protein choices: chicken, shrimp and tofu. I chose tofu, and was expectantly awaiting my side of brown rice only to see it nowhere in sight when the food arrived. Alas, the brown rice was drowning at the bottom of the bowl, soggy and soaked in curry sauce. That was really disappointing for me, because the idea of rice is so that you can modulate how salty you want each mouthful to be, but because every grain of rice was drenched in milky, creamy curry, that proved to be impossible. The taste is decent, although not quite spicy enough for my tastes, but if you ever order this, be sure to request for your rice on the side. I also ordered some shrimp dumplings, which was probably overcooked as the dumpling skin was gelatinous and gluey.  Service was bright and chirpy, but I guess coming from NYC, everyone else will seem angelic in comparison.",

    "text": "(Here's my disclaimer:  I usually think Fox restaurants are pretty meh...not bad and just good enough.  However, True Food is the exception.)  Ugh, last Sunday was a REAL whammy at work, so I told the woman we were going out for food and drinks and on me.  Thankfully, she picked a place that would have more than one item for me to eat.    Each time we visit True Food we're greeted promptly and by friendly staff. We've never experienced a wait longer than five or ten minutes and the atmosphere is nice and bright, especially considering what I used to be (anyone? Coffee Plantation?? Ugh..that bathroom always reeeeeked! I digress)   Anyway, on this particular stop I ordered the Spontaneous Happiness (a cocktail with St. Germain, lime, and ginger/vanilla infused sochu) and m'lady opted for the Apple Carrot and Ginger tonic  to start.  My bev was silky smooth and went down way too fast.  So, then we ordered a bottle of Moscato. What? I was in the mood for sweet drinks...I'm allowed to be frou frou once in a while.    For our appetizers, we ordered the Shiitake and Tofu Lettuce Cups (tofu, cashews, garlic and a gingery sauce) and the Local Vegetable Crudites (fresh veggies from McClendon's farm that came with tzatziki and olive tapenade...neither of which worked for us, so the server brought it with hummus and a champagne vinaigrette instead!! YUM!).  Then we moved on to the Tuscan Kale salad (kale, lemon vinaigrette, Parmesan, and breadcrumbs) sans cheese.  For entrees (I know, it was a feast) she ordered the Shirataki Noodles, and I ordered another Tuscan Kale....it's that good, peeps.    When dessert time came around, we decided on their chocolate pudding (vegan) that came topped with walnuts and pistachios.    Our server (I can't remember her name and I feel like a jerk about it) was rad, the food was perfect and the drinks were divine!",

    "text": "Let's just start off by saying I've never been into trends, especially the most recent \"organic\" foods one (well, I guess recent since the 90s?). While I did feel like I was in an episode of Portlandia when I read the menu, I was delighted with the taste of all the food. The waitress asked if we had every been there before, and told us about how, well, how healthy everything is.   My coworker has been there multiple time, and suggest we start with the edamame dumplings. Very good! Were there worth $2 per dumpling...? I don't know. I guess your wallet decides that.   I had to ask what multiple ingredients were (vegenaise = vegan mayo; hehe!) but finally choose the TLT. Tempeh, by the way, is a compressed soy bean (I think?), smoked, that \"tastes like bacon.\" It was actually really good! I thought the TLT had turkey in it but about 1/2 way through I realized it was just the tempeh. Avocado was great too.  My TLT came with a couple of side options, and none sounded too appetizing (see: previous reviews. I like beer and fries, like every overweight American), but I've been on a health kick, so I went with the kale salad. It was actually very good- due to the grated parmesean and bread crumbs. Very \"kale-y\" still, but I guess kale is kale and there's only so much you can do to mask the healthy taste. The lemon dressing was good, but a bit too much actually and completely soaked my bread on my sammich that was sharing it's plate.   Everything else was generally good (service, decor) but I was surprised for such a busy place, they'd only have one sink in the bathroom. I had to wait for some chick to stop staring at herself (see: Scottsdale location) to wash my hands.   I think I'd go there again just for the TLT ($10)- everything else was out of my budget for a lunch. My coworker got the ravioli; 5 pieces for $15. I have to wait until I marry rich to enjoy those spoils.",

I seriously want one of those huge wood tables in my house, and reallllly had to stop my self from rolling off with one of those cute planters!   We started off with some hummus. It was mighty tasty, but just like other restaurants that serve hummus ::cough cough pitajungle:: they never give you enough pits for all the hummus. I loved the addition of onions and olive and cucumber to the mix.   I also had the \"soda\" of the day. A strawberry rhubarb concoction. It was very refreshing.   For dinner I had the farmers market salad. Sooooo good! So Fresh! loved the peas and asparagus pieces in it.   For dessert we split the strawberry rhubarb crisp! I didnt even feel bad about getting dessert, it was so light and fresh!   I will for sure be going back here, just wish it was a few bucks less a plate!

As much as I like the food, and even though I have the money, I just can't justify spending $7 on a small portion of lentil soup. It didn't even come with a piece of bread or some other like carb.

If, of course, you find inside to be too noisy, there's always the option to go to sit out on the patio.

We sat on their lovely heated patio (gotta love that in mid March) and enjoyed the veggie crudite appetizer.  They freeze the veggies to make them extra tasty...mmm.  There's all sorts of unique juice options on the menu and I opted for the Ginger Nojito, highly recommended by our waitress.  Liked it, a lot!  As for my main entree it was a tough decision between the miso cod and the spaghetti squash casserole, but the squash was calling my way.  It was mixed with organic tomatoes, zucchini,  and lots of fresh mozzarella cheese. It was (almost) as tasty as a plate of spaghetti and definitely a lot healthier!  Rumor has it they may be opening other locations and I'm crossing my fingers one of those is in Chicago!",

It was ok, but not really worth $4, especially with no refills.  I loved that they had the menu marked vegetarian, vegan, and gluten free. That is always much appreciated.    The atmosphere was nice, although my chair wasn't super comfy. Bathrooms were nicely designed, but not cleaned while I was in them.

    "text": "Quality ingredients? Inventive menu items? Yes please!  After a long day of travel I wasn't in the mood for a heavy dinner, and True Food really delivered on all fronts. Being a Monday night, there was plenty of seating available, and our group of five scored a really cool table in the middle of the dining area. Service was on point and we all had drinks right away! I wanted to try a cocktail, but after a long weekend of fun I had to settle for iced green tea. I don't know if I was just really thirsty or what, but it was some of the best green tea I've ever had.  We started with the hummus and the vegetable crudites, both of which were amazing. The veggies were so fresh and piled on ice, and came with two different sauces. I wish I had one of those in my fridge at all times. It was so nice to be eating things out that were so ridiculously healthy and good!  For my entree, I ordered the panang curry with brown rice, potatoes, broccoli, ginger, carrots, mushrooms, and coconut shellfish broth. It was seriously great and had the perfect amount of spice, and I wish I wasn't already almost full when I started eating it! The flavors were fantastic and I could see it being the perfect dish for a cold day (although we are in Phoenix...) Maybe I need to figure out how to make it at home in St. Louis.  Really lovely space for healthy food and and a fun atmosphere. Thanks for a great night True Food!",

    "text": "I've been to the True Foods at Biltmore twice before, but both times it was a discount promotion.  This time my friends and I decided to come here to the Scottsdale location on a normal night.  While I like the layout of the restaurant and the concept, the prices were a little exorbitant for what you get.  The wait was crazy long, but I sort of expected that on a Friday night.  For a drink I got the Dos Cabezas Red Blend.  Good really good.  For the main course I got the roasted chicken, which was good, but basically just four small pieces with herbs.  For dessert, my girlfriend and I split the flourless chocolate cake with ice cream.  It was good, but super tiny.  In hindsight we should gotten one for each of us, but we didn't feel like waiting longer.  All totaled, I dropped about $35 at this place including tip just by myself.  I get that its healthy, its Andrew Wiel certified, and Sam Fox's restaurants charge you as much for the ambience as much as the food.  But I still left here pretty hungry.  My advice?  Go on a promo night like Valentine's Day or AZ Restaurant Week.  Prices are much more reasonable and you'll enjoy the experience far more knowing you didn't have to clean out a big chunk of your wallet to do so.",

    "text": "I came here on a Friday night with my visiting aunt. I thought it was convenient that instead of giving you one of those buzzing things to let you know that your table is ready, they take down your phone number so you can get a text instead. That enabled us to walk around while waiting for about 30 minutes. Standard for a busy place on a Friday night  We sat close to the bar and kitchen so it was loud since you could hear plates clanging and staff yelling orders. It's probably even louder since there are high ceilings and no barrier to the kitchen. If you don't like noise, you probably wouldn't like it here, but if you love good food you'll love it.  To drink I ordered the \"Cucumber refresher\" that was made of cucumber and honey lemonade and my aunt ordered a beer. Just as a note, they only serve bottled or can beer, nothing from a tap. To eat, I ordered the \"inside out\" quinoa burger and my aunt ordered the \"street\" tacos and we shared the \"caramelized onion tart\" appetizer. I loved the kale salad side that came with my quinoa burger, and I was pleasantly surprised that the quinoa burger was basically vegetables, hummus, and tzatziki, sandwiched in between two quinoa burger patties. Nice if you are watching your carbs or don't eat bread.   My aunt seemed to love the Anasazi beans side so much that she made me try it. They were smoky and flavorful. In the street tacos were avocado, cotija cheese, tomatillo salsa, sour cream, and grass fed steak. There was an option for sea bass but she chose steak instead.  Overall, I enjoyed this place. It was a bit loud but the food made up for it and the waiter was very attentive and kind without being anything but genuine. Always appreciated.",

I don't like having to feel like I'm yelling to my guests who are right across from me.   The food is excellent. Fresh, temperature appropriate, and delicious. Kids portions are very generous as are the adult portions. It would be easy to share a kid meal with your little one or have them share with you if your little person is a light eater.

The pizza looked great and they are every bite. The soup I would say noodles they just clumped together but the broth and chicken was on point. My husband said the chopped chicken salad and miso soup was yummy. The water is really good. Nice and clean and cold. We also ordered a lemonade it seemed to be sweetened with honey husband loved it.

They definitely don't have anything to hide in their kitchen.  Upon quick glance of the menu I found a couple vegan options to choose from and had a tough time deciding between \"Andy's Favorite 'TLT'\" and the \"Teriyaki Brown Rice Bowl\" but when with Andy's Favorite \"TLT\" which Tempeh, Lettuce. Tomato. Avocado, Vegenaise, and Whole Grain Bread.  I had the choice to pair it with a kale salad or sweet potato hash and went with the hash.  While it was tasty and I'd say our experience at True Food Kitchen was unique I must say the prices are a bit steep for the amount of food you receive.  I understand it's healthier food and often that comes with a price tag, but $10 for a basic sandwich is a bit much in my opinion.",

    "text": "I had been to this location once before, liked the concept, and decided to bring a friend to try it out yesterday.  Let's start off with what I liked: The Honeydew seasonal soda was refreshing and not too sweet.   The Shiitake and Tofu Lettuce cups had good flavor and texture, despite being extremely messy.  Now for the rest of our experience: Firstly I should make it clear that I am not picky.  If I am hungry, I will eat anything. We ordered the Sea Bass Fish Tacos and the \"TLT\"(tempeh bacon BLT) sandwich to split.  The tacos were not good.  The fish was soggy and had almost no texture or flavor.  So much so that myself and my friend, though we arrived very hungry, didn't even attempt to finish them.  The sandwich was ok, and the sweet potato mash that came on the side was completely undercooked, still crunchy.  Overall, a \"meh\" meal. I'm not one to penny pinch when it comes to a meal.  But to pay $15 for an entree that I didn't even want to finish sucked.  Now on to the service.  I get it, TFK is a busy place.  Being in the service industry myself, I am generally very understanding and patient.  Our server never even refilled our waters, or asked if we might want another soda (I did).  She was also way too touchy-feely.  After we finally received our check, I requested that she take my part out of  two 20s, and put the other half on my friends card.  Ten minutes later, she arrived to tell me that she was very busy and it \" wasn't worth it to her to give me change for the second twenty\", and that I could just keep the tip.    Now I don't know if she made the assumption that my tip wouldn't be worth her time because of my age, apparel, what have you.  But it felt like a huge slap in the face, considering that I was going to tip her my normal 40% despite getting shoddy service and not enjoying my meal.  I've never been treated like that, and I would never treat someone that way.   It's been made very clear to me by that server that True Foods Kitchen doesn't need my business.  So guys, you got your wish.  I won't ever be back and I'll make sure to let my friends know why.",

While I understand that is the role of most servers, Mae went above and beyond to help figure out her mood, taste for the moment and helped to steer her to dining bliss. It really adds to the experience when a server, who was as busy as Mae, made the time to make sure our experience was perfect.",

    "text": "I am not convinced I've never reviewed True Food before. I'm convinced my review must have been lost in some update or something.  Oh, where to start? So, the bigger chains usually turn me off and this is a Fox Restaurant Concept although they've stepped up their game and have some pretty decent places these days. This is definitely one of them.   It is a bit pricey if you're like me and want one of everything, even though you know a simple meal will suffice especially when it's nutrient dense like the ones at True Food. Dr. Andrew Weil helped design the menu here with health and taste in mind. Some of the items are very simple making them delicious, like the turkey sandwich, with grapes (if my memory serves me correctly) and a half and half side of Tuscan kale salad and sweet potato hash. All very simple yet packed full of flavour and well, you just feel healthy afterwards.   The bison burger will keep any meat eater pleased and is a bit more complex, with an umami sauce and a medley of roasted mushrooms and caramelized onions. Even for those such as myself who aren't huge proponents of meat, I have no guilt in indulging in one of these burgers.  The crudites blew my mind the first time I ordered it and the hummus is a personal favorite of mine, I make the same recipe at home and have never had one that tastes better. Okay, maybe once but it was out of state, therefore, out of mind.   These days, I typically order whatever seasonal salad they may have and am always impressed at random goji berries or boysenberries that maybe paired with whatever seasonal vegetables at the time of my visit.  Though their dessert selection is rather minimal, I still love the matcha ice cream. Not to mention the beverages, both alcoholic and non. I personally like the spontaneous happiness drink if I am in the mood to drink and I do spontaneously feel happiness at those times. I also really enjoy their elixir, maybe they have more than one and I'm sure they're equally deserving of a mention but I've only had one.  I've tried a rice noodle mushroom dish that was divine as well.   The kiddo loved the crispness of the veggies in the kids teriyaki bowl which was surprising because she is rather picky and I believe it came with black rice.   I personally don't think one can go wrong at this place. I wasn't stoked on the tuna started we had last time but think it was just the sauce for me. The only other complaint I have is that there isn't one out by me in Gilbert yet, especially with all of the new development in the area.   Fingers crossed.",

    "text": "I used to really like this place and it was a go-to when I'd visit Scottsdale before they began opening more of them in California. Unfortunately, the quality has drastically declined, the prices have shot up and the portions are smaller/wimpier even.  The solid constant are some of the salads to which I ordered an addition of a protein and wanted it crispy-done. It came nearly undercooked and thoroughly inedible. It took our server such a long time to come check on us that by the time she did, it wasn't worth sending the salad back as I was 3/4 finished.  After I shared about the underdone protein, I was offered a replacement meat. I said it's okay as I'm already done with the salad. At this point, seeing that it was untouched, normally, most restaurants, even a small mom n' pops would offer to remove the item from the bill. Nope. Still on there at a price that was more than my kids meal! On top of that, my husband ordered tacos. As easy as a meal can get to prepare in the southwest. Guess not. Out came the dinkiest, chewy, yet saucily marinated street tacos that completely disintegrated within the first bite of the SINGLE, small corn tortilla. He couldn't even lift the remaining tacos as they just unleashed their contents from the single, small corn tortillas.  Why do I repeat \"single, small, corn tortillas\"? Because everyone who has ever made a taco knows that you DOUBLE a corn tortilla (you know, the kind that sell for around $3 for 100 count bag in any grocery store) if the meat is saucy. It was like an attempt at gourmet tacos, as the marinade was good, but between chewy meat and a single, small, corn tortilla at nearly $20... That is just asking to be written-off as a desirable restaurant.  I believe the clean food factor on some of their other items is what keeps this place busy, but someone is in dire need of protein preparation classes! Update 7/12: When management reaches out with a kind message, it really goes noticed and appreciated. So I am increasing the stars from a 1 to 3.",

I can see this would be an important aspect of the brand they are serving. The place is clean and looks very appealing. It's nice to find places that aren't a chain and have reasonable prices. I would for sure go back here. Family friendly restaurant as well. Keep serving up the good True food and fantastic service. You guys rock!!! Thank you for the enjoyable dinner.",

It's obvious that the ingredients are of the highest quality and there is something on the menu for everyone. You can \"feel the love\" in the food and know without a doubt that it's nourishing your body.  I had the ancient grains bowl and added grass fed steak; each bite was full of complex flavors and delicious!  I'll definitely be back frequently.",

The tomatoes are now slices not the tasty little cherry tomatoes. The cucumbers used to be thin slices and now are chunks. BUMMER. Fool me once shame on you, fool me twice shame on me. My bad.

We really appreciated TFK allowing us to have our dog outside, who fared well in the shade provided by the side of the building, the hanging canopies in the alleyway, the umbrella by our table, and the overhead misting.  Adam was our server and he was so genuine and his presence was truly a delight. He answered all of our questions concerning the menu and when we were stuck between dishes, he gave us recommendations that did not disappoint! As it was our first time here, he explained the philosophy and seasonal schedule of the restaurant to us, which is right up our alleys. A changing menu is awesome because it gives incentive to keep you coming back to try more.  We had guacamole as an appetizer which was fresh af on a hot September evening in the Valley. I ordered the chili noodles and my SO ordered some kind of grass-fed burger wrapped in lettuce. After we ate our meal, we didn't feel overly stuffed or uncomfortably filled with heavy food, as meals out often leave us feeling. We felt comfortable, light, and satiated, more than likely due to the fresh ingredients in our dinner. This really makes a difference in our dining experience, and is the main reason we're coming back to experience this place again in the near future.",

I just ate at True Food Kitchen and had to kill guacamole and the grass fed beef burger and that was the best meal I have had in years. Absolutely delicious. You will not be sorry if you eat here. It seems like a vegetable kind of place but it actually has very good meat selections.  I've never had a grass-fed burger that tasted good, and the one I ate today was absolutely delicious. It's going to be hard to not want to go there all the time. And I also got the food to go so I didn't even eat it Fresh Off The Grill I didn't eat it for about 20 minutes after I picked it up.

My only complaint is that the portions are pretty small for the price.  There weren't really any carbs in the casserole dish (mostly squash and tomatoes), so would it have killed them to include a slice of bread?  In fact, they don't offer any kind of complimentary bread or anything when you first sit down.  I'm all for healthy eating, but it's the little touches that make me return to a restaurant.",

    "text": "Sooo disappointed. Arrived here yesterday with a friend at about 4:15pm. Seated promptly. An over bubbly petite girl approached our table.. (you know the kind.. TGI Fridays \"flare\" type) speaking in cheerleading tones, we'll call her \"bubbles\" letting us know our server would be with us in a minute.. right as our server arrived.  There were maybe 5 tables sat including ours in all areas of the restaurant and Ill be damned if our poor server wasnt waiting on every single one of them.. which explains why she wasnt very attentive. Not really her fault..Our food did arrive in a timely fashion delivered by \"Bubbles\". My friend had ordered the squash casserole and had asked if bread was available for her to order and the attitude and outright snottiness of bubbles next comment decided the gratuity and the fact we will never go back. She said \" we dont have bread.. this isnt the Outback.\" You should have seen the looks on our faces.  She then catches herself and says we have pita and my friend staes \"nevermind, that's not what I was looking for\". Bubbles goes away and comes back with an order of pita anyway. We sat in silence for a good 5 minutes.. apalled at that little bitch's outburst. As a manager I would have fired her on the spot for speaking to a patron in that manner.   After the \"incident\" and our meal was finished, the plates were cleared and we sat...and sat while our server tended to the rest of her tables. Meanwhile there are 5 servers doing sidework right in front of us.. including Bubbles (who mind you was leaning over the sidework table laughing and not helping her coworkers at all). We made eye contact with several of them hoping they would notice we were looking for our server and nothing. We had actually wanted dessert but by the time our server finally showed we just wanted to leave. Im sure our server would have been great had she had any form of assistance from her coworkers. But the snottiness of the self righteous self entitled Bubbles was inexcusable.  Im sure you're wondering about the food.. it's decent but not anything amazing..too many restaurants in Phoenix to come back here for their food, let alone to be talked down to by the staff.  Oh and also, we were told their tomatoes are flown in from tuscany.. Seriously? In this economy you're flying tomatoes in from Italy and not supporting your local markets..FAIL",

After eating the food, I know why it was so busy the first night.  Great food and a friendly atmosphere.  I eat a gluten-free diet which in most places makes you feel like your selections are limited...not at TFK.  Excellent selection - my only problem was that I was only there for one night and didn't have enough room in my stomach to try all of the things I wanted.  Next time I am in Phoenix, I will be back...and will wait on line if I have to.  (Note:  went to Christopher's on the first night - what a waste.  Should have went to TFK both nights)",

Even though I saw my server wash his hands, I was still grossed out. I know someone needs to clean the bathroom, but does it really have to be my server?!?!  Don't get me wrong, I was not mad at the staff, because I am sure they were just doing their job, but I really wish I did not have to see that.    I really love this place and always get good service and delicious food but I just don't appreciate my servers also cleaning the bathrooms and then handling my food.

My friend ordered the honey tea, and said it was refreshing and light. Everything on their menu sounds appealing, but is a bit on the pricey side for what it is.  I ordered the chicken sausage skillet from their brunch menu.  It was good, but a little on the bland side.  Could use some salsa or hot sauce to spice it up.  The other two at my table ordered the bison burger, which was amazing!  The flax seed bun was fresh and the fixings were perfect.  Kale salad and sweet potato hash on the side, which were both really good as well.  For dessert, we all had coffee and split the flour-less chocolate cake, which was perfect in size and flavor.  The coffee was nothing to boast about, but it rarely is for me.  Service was good.  I recommend sitting outside if it's a nice day.  Next time, I'd like to try the pizzas or tacos.",

Everything was great, kale salad was a little plain but tasty, ahi salad was our favorite.  I had a kilt lifter from four peaks, one of my favorite beers so not much to say about that.  For entrees i had pan roasted chicken with brussels sprouts and butternut squash and faro, and my date had salmon with quinoa. I would have liked more Brussels sprouts (1 total cut in half) but everything was so good together it didn't matter.  The salmon and quinoa beet salad was incredible. The salmon was cooked and seasoned perfectly.  Damon, our server, was an amazing host. He suggested most of the things we had and he was dead on. We had a great time. Awesome.....and we'll be back.....loved it.",

At first look I thought it would be a vegetarian rest. but it's actually more of a \"anti-inflammatory\" restaurant where they focus on healthy dishes that do more good than harm on your body. A nutritionist by the name of Dr Weil is the founder. I don't think you can go wrong with anything on the menu. We sampled multiple dishes. One that I ordered was called \"Panang Curry\". If you like thai peanut sauce get this. Overall...great experience. Thanks Dr Weil!",

Our first trip was dinner; I had a turkey wrap thing that was v. v. good...Boyfriend had the kale garlic pizza (which, just, wow, no words!), and Boyfriend's Mom had grilled salmon which she thought was v. v. good also!  I loved their selection of interesting & different drinks, also!  We came back for lunch a couple days later--I just had the margarita pizza, Boyfriend had a pizza with manchego, I think (?) and peppers, and Boyfriend's Mom had the kale pizza that BF had a couple nights prior.  Definitely high marks, still, for lunch!  All in all it was a really great experience...unfortunately, there aren't any in California, but we were told that they are opening one in Newport Beach and one in Santa Monica (YAYYY!) in a year or two!  This is SUCH a California place--once they get out here, I think they will do very well!",

My sister-in-law ordered the spaghetti squash casserole which was miniscule,  one daughter ordered the tacos, there was 3, and I wouldn't even call them the size of an appetizer, the other daughter ordered a pizza which she said was tasty, and looked to be of lunch size.

The salad had the perfect consistency of crunch and lightness. The Fish in the tacos was moist and flaky and seasons light and just right.  We also had the retail therapy cocktail, it was also delightful, not too sweet and very refreshing and made you want more , but then who would drive us home.

The Kale salad, and pizzas, green tea soba noodles, and the PITA (trying to figure out the recipe)... the raw fish of the day... of course the juices... everyone was ambrosial, yes I tried them all! All was prepared so delicately and with much culinary care.  This is the type of place you go when you want to eat healthy, and still feel it is gourmet, or you are trying to turn someone on to eating healthier...  Or you have mixed eaters, picky, vegan, veg, no wheat etc.  Once again Sam Fox & his team are brilliant. I was told it took 1.5 years to plan this place... there was so much that could not (would not) be compromised... I was rather impressed that they paid for the full liquor license only to cary one organic rum and vodka... They are taking a huge money loss by sticking to the philosophy...  Also with the demand that everything be fresh, the food cost must be frightening...   I hope people give this a try... it is the most delicious well done foodie health food I have ever had... and I dine around.   yum... I miss it already.",

I've been three times and twice felt neglected for long periods of time (and my \"service\" measuring stick is low - be friendly and keep an eye on my wine glass and you're my best friend).  I love the concept.  There are too many corporate chain restaurants (I know, True Food could be considered a corporate chain but I prefer not to think of it that way) that serve heaping plates of fat and salt filled belly bombs (Cheesecake factory) to clientele that has no business eating like that (Buy a mirror people!).  For those of us that try to keep up appearences, its nice to have a healthy option that makes a great attempt at pleasing the pallette in cool surroundings.  I have enjoyed every meal I have eaten at True Food, and I did not feel any bloated guilt when I left.",

    "text": "Kathryn, my girlfriend, loves True Food kitchen and I am a skeptic of anything done by the FOX group especially when it aligns itself to a single philophers idea of eating well, in this case Dr. Weil. I am also a pretty critical person and enjoy critiquing most everything especially eatieries and restaurants.  One issue we have is that we are Vegans and while they do have a number of items listed as Vegan on the menu there are a few things that just seem silly. The first one is that they have no Salads listed as Vegan and the second is that they do not offer Vegan Mayo. The last time we mentioned the Mayo thing our server gave us a reason why they didnt but that we are welcome to bring our own in.  Today has been a fun day so I thought going to True Food would be a good treat for Kathryn and maybe distract me from other events occuring recently. Our server, Chris, has waited on us before and is always very nice. When we mentioned the Soy Mayo thing she offered to go talk to the chef and managers. When she returned the reply was that \"at some point we have to draw the line.\" To which I explained that by offering Vegan/Soy Mayo they would lower costs, increase shelf life, and even start substituting it with real Mayo without anyone noticing. She thought these were valid enough and again went to talk with the chef and managers. To which Kathryn and I exchanged glances and began eating our soup.  To our surprise our next visitor was none other than Michael Stebner the Executive Chef of the restaurant. We began a 10 minute conversation about their philosophy and methodology for creating the menu. He explained that they are not a health food restaurant but rather a restaurant with a health focus. He also pointed out that they are happy to modify anything on the menu to accomodate a number of eating requirements. This was really cool stuff.  He then went further and talked about his history as a chef and what he has seen work and not work from a practical perspective. This was a real conversation and I appreciate his engagement with us both. At no time was he demeaning to us and he never brushed a point of ours off. While I disagree with the philosophy of their menu I respect their methodology and see that they are interested in doing something more than just sell as much food as possible.  Overall this was a great experience and while it did not result in everything I wanted I am more than happy to refer anyone to eat here and will be back again!",

Drowning in sauce.  But, at least the service was decent.  Just went a third time and it will be my last.  Both the food and service were horrible.  Went for lunch, sat inside and it wasn't very busy.  Our waiter was totally out of it and only had 4 tables and hardly paid any attention to us and kept forgetting things, like taking our order to start.    Then, even the food runner forgot to bring me half my meal after I asked her for it.  In the meantime, I counted at least 17 staff member hanging out in the kitchen area, which is open, so you can see them and half of them were folding napkins.  My food was not very good and actually made me a little sick.  This is a shame, especially because there aren't many places in Phx that have vegan choices, but for the price you pay, I would expect a lot more.",

Don't be mislead, the wasabi is merely a nice little portion which gives you a perfect essence, no epic nasal burns here. I ordered mine with the sweet potato hash which was absolutely amazing and the Green Arnie (Matcha Green Tea & Honey Lemonade) for my drink which was very refreshing and a perfect match. If you get the opportunity to stop in, look for Nate he's the cool guy at the bar. He'll get you squared away. True Food Kitchen is a cool place, great atmosphere, with awesome people.

The menu was impressive with its edamame dumplings and teriyaki brown rice with tofu, but the food itself wasn't AWESOME.  It was kind of like, Ok.  I tried the place, but I'm in no rush to return anytime soon.  I also wasn't particularly impressed by our waitress.  She was a bit too perky and a bit too in-your-face about the greatness of True Food.  I love everything that True Food stands for, but there was something that was a bit snooty about the environment.  There was so much emphasis on the greatness of True Food that I was kind of turned off by it.    I will say, though, that the natural refresher drinks are really good.  I had the cucumber refresher with cucumber and honey lemonade.  Highly recommend.   Not too much cucumber taste and just enough honey lemonade that it wasn't too sweet.  Here's my overall rating:  Food: Meh. Price: Not awesome, but tolerable. Parking: No problem. Service: Not impressed. Ambience: A bit too trendy. Chefs: Cute.  Also particularly questionable to me was: who the hell is Dr. Weil?  Where I come from, he's a foot doctor.  Apparently around these parts, he's some bigger dude that is qualified to discuss healthy living.  Hm...",

    "text": "I feel strange giving Tru Foods Camelback a low rating when everyone is slapping five stars on but YUCK. This is my second time here. I keep wanting to like it. I love the concept of quality ingredients etc but the food is actually GROSS. My main complaint is SALT. And I'm a person who likes salt, adds salt to my food, uses salt. I don't go out of my way to avoid salt but the food, and I mean all the dishes we tried, were excessively sickeningly SALTY. We got the daily special soup to start and hubby got Moroccan chicken and I got bison burger with sweet potato hash. Everything was way too salty. Not just me. Hubby thought so too. My burger came out NOT as I had ordered it and the manager was very sweet about trying to make it right but we didn't have the time to wait for a whole new entree. The burger was lukewarm, over salted and weirdly mushy. I'm not even concerned about salt in general but this was grossly over salted.   One more thing. I know I sound like a partypooper by now but if I go to a nice restaurant for a Friday night date, I would like that experience to be dog-free. The patio seating was absolutely infested with dogs. You had to push them out of the way to get in the door. I saw a server pet one on his way by! (What does Health Department have to say about that??) and one dog was doing a lot of barking.   A great disappointment.",

    "text": "Note: I've only been here once, but I'll update my review if/as I go more and further inform my opinion.  This place was perfectly enjoyable. The food and juice selections are on point and just what you would expect from an establishment branded as \"True Food Kitchen.\" A cautionary note to the juices would be that if you're ordering one that incorporates lemonade, you might ask them to go light on it if you want to avoid a lot of sugar. But I want to focus on what makes this place exceptional.  The floorplan of the restaurant is really lovely and engaging. You come in and you can see the cooks prepping for a lot of the dishes you read about on the menu. I've never seen anything like this before, and I really loved it. Secondly, this place is probably one of the best places to split a meal. I don't recall if there was a split plate charge, but it would be worth it regardless. My co-worker and I decided to split the Quinoa Burger and a salad, and we received separately plated mini-burgers with our portion of the sides, and our salad portions were served to us in our own bowls. Maybe I'm eating at the wrong places, but I felt like that was truly exceptional service. Lastly, the menu was really varied and had lots of options for vegetarian and gluten free fare.   tl;dr This restaurant trafficked in pretty standard \"heatlhy\" fare and did a fine job. What sets it apart is the experience provided by the friendly, knowledgeable staff and the overall setting, which is greatly enhanced by the integration of prep space into the floor plan of the dining area.  UPDATE: There is no split plate fee at True Food, as verified by the owner in the below comment. Further awesome, verified.",

Served with pure maple syrup and Greek yogurt, this dish is a godsend from heaven!    And while I'm here updating my original TFK review, I have to add that service is always fabulous.  Damon has a special place in my heart as he was my first ever server, and continues to be friendly and attentive when I get seated in his section, but I've had numerous other servers, and they've all been awesome.  I hope that the new Scottsdale Quarter location will be just as successful as this one.  Until next time, TFK - see you soon!",

    "text": "I went here last night with a friend who was looking for restaurants with healthier menus.  I told him to pick and he picked True Food Kitchen.  We ordered the $9 Grilled Shrimp Spring Roll appetizer to share.  Neither one of us enjoyed it.  My friend picked the shrimp out of the two rolls and left the wrappers and other fillings.  I ate half of one, but the shrimp tasted a little... dirty.  The  $13 Spaghetti Squash Casserole I ordered was quite good, but I was looking for it to have some other dimension to it.  It was simple - spaghetti squash, a little tomato sauce and cheese.  I ate nearly all of it, but I left thinking that I could make it a little better at home with massive amounts of garlic.  My friend ordered the $16 Bison burger with the sweet potato hash and kale salad as sides.  The waiter awesomely allowed him to have half a side of each because he could not decide.  He also said that if he wanted more of one or the other, he would be happy to bring a little extra.  Very cool.  Overall, we had an okay meal here.  I'd say for food, we'd give it a 3.5* rating.  The waiter was so stellar, it raises the place to 4 stars.  The space is very modern and \"clean.\"  Would i eat here again on my own?  Truthfully, probably not.  I prefer some of the other Fox Restaurant Concepts to this one, namely Modern Steak and The Arrogant Butcher.  Still, it is a cool idea for people looking to eat healthier.  P.S. I noticed HORDES of beautiful women dining here, most of them very well dressed and in good shape.  I figured I would add that tidbit because either the food is working or... they have all those ladies tricked.  Still, it might be a good place to hang out if you were a single dude looking for a date.",

Once seated a wonderful waiter checked in with us to take our drink order. In a matter of minutes he was back to take our food order. Prompt, courteous, helpful, service is what I have become accustomed to receiving at TFK.  Our orders consisted of: shitaki and lettuce tofu cups (delish and fresh!), caramelized onion tart (sounds much better than it really is), harvest chopped salad (an absolute FAV which I order almost every visit!), street tacos (my friends go to staple food here) and the roasted chicken (absolutely gives the panang curry a run for its money!!   Honestly, the roasted chicken was SO incredibly phenomenal, I wish I would have gotten an order to go! Since I didn't...they may find me at dinner there again tomorrow--since this is the only time this meal is served.  Bottom line...this place keeps getting better and better!  As a side note--we heard from a reliable source this evening that the menu will be undergoing some changes in the coming months. I can only imagine the delectable meals that await us!",

We were seated promptly in a corner booth on the patio. I loved the ambiance, as we were looking for a super casual environment and this place didn't disappoint.   Our server was personable and very knowledgable about the menu.  The inside out quinoa burger was delicious and filling. However,  my favorite part of my meal was the kale salad, which was one of my two sides. It was appropriately dressed in a lemon vinaigrette that complimented, not overpowered the kale. The sweet potato hash was delicious as well, although I'm not sure what exactly made it a \"hash\".  I can attest to the fact that one of my friends' ordered the panang curry and it smelled delicious. I don't even like curry!  Another friend ordered the steak street tacos. She really liked them. My friend that ordered the salmon was thoroughly impressed with it which made me a little sad I didn't order it!  One Person in our party ordered the spaghetti squash casserole. It looked amazing!! Covered in cheese and tomato sauce. Actually, there was so much cheese I question how healthy that particular meal actually is!  All in all it was a great experience and I am anxious to return!",

    "text": "Two years after visiting this restaurant, I still remember what we ordered and how we enjoyed the food and atmosphere... what does that tell you? It was good and memorable! The atmosphere is a little artsy, but the staff was welcoming and friendly.  Since the prices are a little higher, we decided not to get any appetizers, smoothies (which looked great), or drinks.  When we went, we were able to get half size salads and some of the entrees were allowed to be halved (not sure if they still do this). I started with half of a Sashimi Tuna salad. Dressing was sweet and delicious; plenty of salad for half the cost.  For our entrees we ordered a half Turkey Bolognese and a full Pan Seared Sea Bass. The turkey was moist, tender, and flavorful. Sauce was great, and the pasta did not seem overly \"brown rice\".  The sea bass's portion size was a little small, but it is an expensive fish. Fish was perfecty cooked; fork tender. The umami sauce was perfectly seasoned and complemented the fish and vegetables.  There are many things on the menu we wanted to try, so we'll have to come back again.  Pros: Stevia packets on the table (more restaurants need this!), healthy and tasty food, good selection, and the no-guilt feeling afterwards.  Cons: Have to get parking validated (it ends up being free), it is far for someone in the East Valley who wants to come more often, and it is a little expensive for the portions (but it's healthy!).",

    "text": "I'll be honest, the food was so good I ate here twice in one day. Very simple, clean, but elegant pairings with the freshest ingredients around. I had the edamame dumplings and the farmer's market salad for lunch. The dumplings were more like ravioli with a bit of truffle oil - some of the best I've had. I really would have been happy with an entire plate of these for my meal! The salad was fresh and crisp, and an interesting combination of ingredients - golden beets, kale, romaine, manchego cheese, avocado, with a light champagne vinagerette.   Later, I ordered the thai dumplings and steelhead salmon for dinner. The dumplings were good, but not as good as the edamame dumplings from lunch. The salmon was cooked perfectly - good sear on the outside, and moist on the inside - all on top of a bed of beets, greens, and red quinoa.   Price is a bit of a drawback here, but I suppose you pay for what you get when it comes to the calibur of the ingredients. I don't live in AZ, but a True Food just opened in Denver where I live - can't wait to get back here.",

I think I could eat it for lunch every single day and not get sick of it. Everything on the menu looks so good it's hard to decide what to get! Good red wine selection (very important) and lots of good juice options, I tried a kale one the last time I was there. Definitely not cheap though.

Great for the vegan/veg crowd and I described it to the lovely as eating grass. Another yelper did brilliantly to describe it as organic in a blah blah blah kind of way.   After sharing the trough of vegetable crudites, I had the panang curry which was a large portion - lots of veggies and about 5 shrimp - but it was flavorful and yummy, served piping hot. The friendy friends both had salmon with kale which looked interesting but not really flavorful. I get it. They love it.  And me? I know I need to eat more veggies but that's not why I go out to dinner - I want deliciousness. And this was good, not my wheel house but good.   And did someone here say there's real food for non vegetarians? If I brought the lovely here? Yah, no. We'd be marching down the sidewalk to Capital Grille. Don't fight it kids, it is what it is.

Everything on the menu is clearly outlined if it's vegetarian or vegan, so people with all types of diets will be happy.  The Biltmore Fashion Park restaurant even looks healthy, with a bright green motif and servers donning bright green capri pants-not the most fashionable get-up, but it mos def drives the point home that the eatery is going for a healthy, green vibe.  And, like Fox's others restaurants, this one has an open kitchen, though here, the kitchen/prep area seemed to take up more than half the restaurant, which I thought was pretty odd.  The crowd of diners was varied. There were plenty of 20-somethings, a ton of middle-aged folks and even families with babies mixed in.  While the atmosphere was slightly above average, the food was excellent. I started with a bowl of mushroom-filled miso soup ($6), which was vegan and chock full of shrooms, scallions and tofu. I loved it!  I paired my meal with a Cucumber Refresher ($4), a cucumber-infused honey lemonade. It was sweet, refreshing and didn't make me feel guilty about drinking it.  For my entree, I ordered a ricotta ravioli ($13), which was covered in a pesto sauce, more mushrooms and red peppers. It was an interesting twist on traditional tomato sauce-covered pasta, and it really filled me up.  For me, I'll definitely be going back to try more tasty meat-free bites.",

Put wheat grass plants in any restaurant and I love it!  I had the harvest salad to start and I must say I want to go back every day just for this. Goat cheese, apples, walnuts, butternut squash and pomegrant-lious! I had the teriayki tofu for my main course. I wasn't as impressed. Teriyaki sauce is not my favorite but I was really craving the tofu, which was good tofu. You can actually substitute tofu for the meat in alot of the dishes, so I really liked that. The drinks are definitely not the focal point of this place, as I did not care for the rye vodka they had (their only vodka).  I will definitely be back again and again....",

    "text": "Crazy night I had trying to figure out how to spend my Fox Restaurant $25 gift card. I wanted to go to Blanco, but it was packed and I didn't want to wait. Olive and Ivy was the same story, so I decided to head back into the city almost forgetting True Food.   I was the only one at the bar, and the bartender was extremely friendly and helpful. Didn't hurt that she was gorgeous as well, but that is besides the point completely. The whole restaurant is distinctively Sam Fox with the raw woods, bright colors, and really unique lighting. I hit the bathroom right away and that was the coolest part of the restaurant (I'm a sucker for neat-o bathrooms since I'm working on a remodel of mine) with the water-free urinal and Dyson Airblade hand dryers. I'd never seen those things before, and I must say they are the first air dryer that I have ever found to be worth a crap.   I ordered the Ahi Tuna Sliders, which were unbelievably delicious, and at $13, not a bank breaker. They came with a Sweet Potato Hash that was great as well. The Hummus was also phenomenal, and probably the best I've had in quite some time. The menu featured plenty of organic, vegan, and and vegetarian offerings as well as some boutique wines. I never knew there was a type of wine that was both organic and sustainable using recycled products. There was a lot of thought that went into the menu here and I think they should be applauded for it.  The restaurant is instantly one of my favorites, from the list of $20 bottles of wine, to the awesome food, to the neat-o restrooms and the spot on service. Everything about the place screamed greatness. $31 for 2 beers, an appetizer, and an entree is very reasonable in my book, especially considering the quality. If you're looking for a big filling greasy meal, skip True food. If what you want is a healthy, delicious meal that won't leave you feeling like a fat grease-ball, eat here and be happy you just found your new favorite Biltmore restaurant.",

True Food Kitchen, the latest to come from Fox Restaurant Concepts and Dr. Andrew Well of the Oprah fame, certainly lives up (and possibly surpasses) the fame of it's sister restaurants.   The menu consists of all Natural/ organic foods with a healthy twist. The servers are even wearing \"natural clothes\" that actually look like pajamas!   I ate quick and wish I had time to really dive into the menu, but what I had... I loved! My boyfriend had the Ahi Tuna burger and said \"it was the best ahi burger he has ever had\" (BOLD STATEMENT). I had the Turkey Spaghetti Bolognese, which was amazing! The bolognese had chucks of carrots and other vegetables, and the portion size was perfect. We definitely wanted to try the Sashimi appetizer, that the table next to us said was delicious and fresh.   Overall, the service was excellent- they really were interested in if we enjoyed our experience and had any comments for the new serving team. I loved the menu, it was so different and not outrageously priced. It's clear that a lot of research went in to everything from the decor to the wine selection.   I'm looking forward to getting into the menu a bit more next time!!",

However I feel that Dr Weil has has has the wool pulled over his eyes by Mr. Fox. Come one \"Anazazi Beans\" and a drink called the \"Medicine Man\"? Really- as an American Indian rights advocate you'd think we'd be past this. Actually, you'd think educated white men with lots of money would be past this --but ya know. Just because Anazazi really refers to Ancestral Pueblo people who lived mainly in NM and N. AZ and means \"ancient enemy\" in Navajo so that term isn't used by nearly ANYONE anymore...means that you probaby shouldn't call your dish by that name. Other than that- I give em props for trying.  I recently had another experience there where EVERYTHING was going wrong that night, and the staff recovered....kinda. My advice, shape up if ya wanna last.",

    "text": "\"No, they're not fried... they're Wok'd\"   (picture it.....the original Hairspray movie....this was said to me with the same inflection and tone of  Tracy Turblad when speaking to her Geometry Teacher about her hair.. \"Its feathered....not ratted\")  True Food is a better choice for other people.   I finally was able to eat here... as most everyone I know has already been here and raved.  Why?  That.. I'm not sure about.   The place has warm inviting \"butter\" tones with wood accents that all come together to create this bright and spacious restaurant.  It features an \"exposition\" style kitchen with basic comfortable seating.    The first thing I noticed was the STAFF! ... so many..... so available... so...so... Visible.  There was no place for the staff to hide and compare notes on bad tippers or to avoid refilling your water.  Quickly looking around the place, I counted 14 servers, a few bartenders and a few bus/host persons... all to serve about 60 of us that were in for an early dinner (6:30).  The restaurant, when full, seats 120. The staff moved about the place like a dance troupe (yes.. in all sense of the word) , all young , fresh , energy infused servers..Smiling, helping each other out.. it was kinda sickening to see such a large group get along so well... I'm thinking that antidepressants are served with the employee meals.    I noticed a great perk in the refreshments menu, you can add a shot of organic vodka to any of the natural drinks for a $3.00 up charge!  See mom... you were totally wrong.. Drinking CAN be healthy!!  We started our meals with the Shrimp Dumplings and the herb hummus.  When I asked if the dumplings were steamed or pan fried our waiter replied \"No, they're not fried... they're Wok'd\"... silly me and all this time I thought a wok was a pan.    The plump wok'd dumplings were very good, served in a mild mushroom broth with cilantro and scallions  ($10) the creamy hummus was delicious with fresh pita ($8).  The \"salad\" in the menu's description was basically just a small bit of salad place on top of the 2/3c portion of hummus.  Impressed by the apps were really looking forward to the entrees.  Being pressured to choose an entree, I opted for the steak tacos ($14) (What the hell was I thinking? ), my friends ordered the butternut squash ravioli with mushrooms ($13)  and also the natural pan roasted chicken ($18).  2 losers 1 winner arrived...I shouldn't say losers... because, they were ok... just not equal.     The steak tacos were just that... YAWN... I blame myself for not taking the time to review the menu.  2 large steak tacos with a large side of yummy, spicy Anasazi beans.. if I closed my eyes and tasted the tacos, I don't think I could tell if I were at Baja Fresh or True Food... Honestly.. Order the chicken.  The Squash Ravioli were very good, but it was agreed by all that the sweetness of the filling did not pair very well with the scrumptious (yes... scrumptious)  mushroom sauce.  What a shame, the sauce over simple pasta would have fared better in our eyes.  The star of the night, or shall I said DIVA... was the chicken... OH MY GOD.. who would have guessed a boneless, free range chicken would be soooooooooo delicious.  The chicken was pan fried to perfection (skin on to retain moisture) with a light savory seasoning, served over farro (a new whole grain for me).    THIS WAS THE MOST DELIOUS CHICKEN I HAVE EVER EATEN..so very juicy, the flavors so subtle ,  I was pissed the server did not steer me in that direction.   We all ended up eating the chicken since we were all impressed by it.  I hear that the Kale salad paired with the pan roasted chicken is the meal of the gods.    All in all we enjoyed our time there.. but not over the top impressed... I can tell you we will never order the ravioli or tacos again.. but the kale salad and the chicken...that's a different story.  I hear from the manager that the restaurant will be getting tons of attention from both local and nationwide media, so this concept might become the next healthy Chili's.  When leaving the restaurant we noticed a \"protected\" private dining area in the back of the place... may want to inquire if you're with a larger group.",

I have tried the flat breads, salads and wraps, and all have been healthy, tasty and super fresh. Also a great place if you are dining with someone who is vegetarian, vegan and/or gluten free as everything is clearly labeled. and, the lemonade with honey sounds weird, but it is really, really yummy. tart and sweet in a totally different sort of way.   Also, the decor is very interesting. It all appears to be sustainable/eco friendly and the herbs and edible grasses growing all around are appealing and really bring home the fresh, natural, healthy vibe. Hopefully this concept will catch on...",

My Top Picks: Beverage: Medicine Man Elixir Salad: Greek Chopped w/ Chicken Sandwich: Columbia River Salmon w/ lime & avocado Entree:  Spaghetti Squash Casserole Sides:  Farro!!  (It's awesome, sweet with dates.)   Usually busy around lunch, call ahead and put your name on the list!  But even if you don't, there's plenty of room, and they turn tables quick, so you can get in and out in under an hour if you need to.    They are the official catering restaurant of the Phx Suns.  They must like it, because i was there for lunch this Friday and Grant Hill walked in.    Good spot for lunch in the Biltmore!",

It has been several months, but it was definitely un remarkable. He had a boring pizza with the most boring of crusts. And I had the Goat Cheese ravioli. It was like eating sterile food for someone with health issues. Bland and forgettable. Healthy doesn't have to be boring.   And who cares that Andrew Weil had any hand in this place.

The Good: The food was good as well as being fairly healthy.  The Bad: No matter how many ways it can be prepared, Kale(sp?) is never going to be a part of my diet.   Overall, If you don't mind waiting for trendy Cafeteria's with better food then your old high school, this is the place for you!! Very much the place to be right now.

We are not that familiar with the Biltmore area so we just happened to pick True Food.  It looked busy (a good sign of a good place to eat), it looked healthy (got that from the name), and it appeared to be casual.  Exactly what we were looking for!  The service was just OK.  One funny thing happened, our waiter walked right into the glass door of the private room.  Don't worry, he wasn't hurt.  He brought us the wrong salad.  He took away my knife and brought me a fork replacement instead of a knife.  He did have one great recommendation....the hummas appetizer.  This was fantastic.  We did need extra pita bread.  We split the chopped greek salad with chicken.  It tasted great; however, the portion was crazy small for the $12 price.  For our entree we split (bad idea) the butternut squash raviolis.  We each got 2 raviolis.  The taste was just OK.  Our server highly recommended this dish to us.  Not sure why.    Over all the portion sizes are ridiculously small.  The table next to us agreed.  The LOVED their soup and apple crisp dessert but nothing else.    So if you go...get the hummas appetizer, soup and dessert and you may like it!

    "text": "Went here for a second time. I do like how you come away feeling less guilty about eating out because their menu seems so health-conscious. I like their off-the-beaten-path drink menu. Honey and cucumber lemonade, who'd have thunk? Extremely refreshing. Looking forward to trying more drinks in the future.  Last time I was there, I had the shrimp dumplings, which were fine, and butternut squash ravioli. Really good but not as filling as I would've liked. This time, I munched on edamame dumplings for an appetizer. They mash them up really well. Not sure if everyone would like the paste-like texture but it was yummy to me. Had just a hint of spiciness and was wading in sesame-oil broth. I had a grilled sustainable salmon fillet on a piece of wheat bread with cilantro aioli and I went for the sweet potato hash. The hash is worth a trip here. It wasn't greasy. I like it loads better than home fried potatoes. May try making it on my own sometime.  Sitting inside is kind of neat because you can observe staff prepping some items on open islands. Staff has seemed perfectly nice so far. A friend said she got looks from some people when she went for how casual she dressed. I didn't get the sense today as one guy came in with a bulky backpack and someone else was in jeans. And nobody should be criticizing as the wait staff themselves are allowed to wear Keds or whatever sneaker wear. Anyway, I'd bring visitors or native friends here. Lunch for two with appetizer and a drink was about $40 before tip.",

    "text": "So I had no idea about this place before I showed up, other than it's my Phoenix based friend's *favorite* place and she's willing to drive an hour to get to it.   I love healthy eating, and was intrigued by the lunch menu, which ranged from really different salads (I live in the mountains - kale & lemon is decidedly exotic).  The plates that came out all looked so appetizing, and slightly higher end cuisine than the health food I'm accustomed to seeing.    My friend is a kale addict, so we had the kale salad and the kale & roast garlic pizza.  The salad was terrific, much better than my lame attempts at taming raw lacinato kale.  Our server must have been new (or frazzled) for we never received the 'Andrew Weil' card about the philosophy of the place.  The only reason I figured out he was involved was when I saw him sitting not 10 feet from me at a booth across the aisle, chatting amiably with his table mates, in a white apron.   Phoenix celebrity sighting!  Overall I really liked the concept of the place, and while one lunch there doesn't give me a full picture, it, more than anything else I experienced in this city, would encourage me to come back to the desert.  For someone who loathes temperatures above 70 degrees, that should be considered high praise.",

    "text": "I won't go back to this restaurant.  The food literally made me ill.  It is clean, the decor is good, and the service can't be faulted.  However, I spent all night in the bathroom losing the meal I had there.  How do I know their food caused it? I had a bowl of cereal that morning.  What I lost that was undigested was my meal from True Food's, a clear sign of food poisoning.  I had the teryaki tofu.  My neighbor had salmon and was fine.  I plan to call them tomorrow and notify them of what happened.    My general opinion of the place if I hadn't become ill.  It is a trendy place with an interesting menu. The service was good-I had no complaints.   It was clean and the deco handsome and low key.  I found it  disconcerting that neither of us could easily read the menu due to the dim lights.  I noticed the gentleman at the next table tipping his menu to catch more light while he was trying to read it.  How long it will stay a gathering place for the for the more socially inclined, I question.   Both of us thought for the most part the items on the menu were overpriced.  The restaurant is located at the Biltmore  so I expected the prices to be at least a bit high anyway and they were.     We did have to get a steak knife for my friend to be able to cut the bread her salmon was on. The restrooms were interesting with unique dryers that actually did a complete job of drying the hands.  Added 1/29-I decided to email Sam Fox instead of calling.  No reply as yet. 2/2-It is now the day after the Super Bowl and still no response.   That tells me something about the owner, Sam Fox, and his attitude. When I sent him a compliment on another of his restaurants, I got almost an immediate response.  Not this time!  5/27/09-never heard back.  Negative one star for this one.",

Because of my extensive \"forbidden foods\" list, I order like Meg Ryan in \"When Harry Met Sally\" - substitute this for that, put this on the side, add that - yet the staff never treats me like the pain I know I'm being.  Instead, they politely take my order and get it right every time.  I would recommend this place to anyone!",

    "text": "First, let me say that I am a huge fan of Dr. Andrew Weil.  He is an advocate of eating whole, natural and organic foods whenever possible.  He doesn't have a 'diet' book, but he does advocate for eating in a way that our bodies our truly nourished.  I was soo excited to find out about True Food Kitchen.  I found the decor to be light and festive.  My dad found the colors reminded him of the 70's. lol. Our waiter was really nice and took the time to explain all of the teas available to my mom. He suggested we try the hummus, and since I'm a sucker for chickpeas, we ordered it. I'm totally going to start making my hummus with some jalepeno!  It was great, but a tad spicy for some.  We loved it.  I had the steak tacos with adzuki beans.  The beans were quite spicy and I only ate half, but they were delicious. The tacos were great and I could tell the meat was \"organic\" (duh, of course meat is organic people!) because of the distinct taste of meat not raised with added hormones.    One plus about this place is that people who have allergies to certain food products are absolutely able to eat here.  There are plenty of vegan, vegetarian, and dairy-free items on the menu. I will definitely be back.  My only problem is that I found it to be a bit expensive, but then again, I'm cheap. lol.  Plus:  I saw some dogs seated with owners at their side patio tables!",

    "text": "I was lucky enough to dine at True Food as part of Arizona Restaurant Week. We went during the week, so it was full, but not too busy. This restaurant had to be one of the best deals for all of Restaurant Week. In addition to the three courses, we also received a hummus appetizer for the table and each of us received one of their Natural Refreshers. The hummus plate was delish; the refresher was okay . . . I liked my wine better. =) Our server was very nice and super knowledgeable without being pushy.  There were four of us at the table and we each ordered something different so everyone could try as much as possible. I am so glad we did this! My appetizer was the Smoked Salmon, which was great with the wasabi peas. The Summer Chopped Salad was delicious and so large it could have been a meal! I did not order the Edamame Dumplings because the description did not sound interesting to me, however when I tried them I was surprised at all of the flavor from one dumpling.   On to the second course. The Gluten Free Spaghetti was good, as was the Tofu Curry. The Black Cod was all right too. My Steak Tacos, on the other hand, were fabulous! Steak was perfect; the beans that came with it were ok.  Dessert was the best! We tried four of them; my favorites (in order) were The Banana Chocolate Tart (very rich, must share), the Apple-Cranberry Crumble (the maple ice cream really makes the dish), the Lemon-Ginger Frozen Yogurt (sweet, tart, and cold), and the Lemon Olive Oil Cake (very light, fluffy, and delicious)!  Not sure how soon I will make it back as it is not an easy drive for me, however if someone else is planning an outing, I would love to go!",

    "text": "Disclaimer: I can't be objective with this place since I harbor deep resentment for the loss of Coffee Plantation (the former tenant in this space).  So if you want an objective review, skip to another yelper.  As a Biltmore resident, the last thing I needed walking distance to my house was a new restaurant.  The Biltmore and Esplanade already had plenty of restaurants.  Coffee Plantation was a community hangout and the neighborhood just does not feel the same without it.  The blue grass jams on Sunday are no more, the college kids studying are gone, and no longer do I see my neighbors grabbing coffee in the morning.  Paradise Bakery is no substitute.  As for True Food itself, the food is inconsistent so order with care.  The tuna appetizer has been pushed on me more than once and I have always been very disappointed in the quality of the fish.  Call it what you like, it's just plain tuna sashimi floating in some kind of sauce.  Some items I do like are the Teriyaki Tofu and the Curry Chicken (substituting with Tofu), but I question their logic.  With the Curry you get noodles and with the Teriyaki, you get rice.  It seems like it should be the other way around for me, or at least give the option of rice with the curry.    I do like their juices but could do without the waiters giving you the canned speeches.  Try asking what Olivello juice is and you will get a scripted response about sea buckthorn berries.  Say what?  Olivello is a trademarked name apparently.  The sea buckthorn berry exists, but still you can't help but feel like a sucker for ordering something with so many names.  Have you ever seen a seabuckthorn berry?  Me neither.  Another yelper had to point me to a website describing the plant (thanks Chad H.).  Surprise surprise, it also doesn't taste all that great.  My advice, add the $3.00 shot of vodka and let your questions fade away to the back of your mind.  And while I do agree with many of the health ideas behind the menu in general, they could make it a little more subtle.  When people put forth their views so strongly you can't help but question their sincerity.  The food should not need trademarked names, a celebrity endorsement, or other affirmations of healthiness if it really does the good things they say.  The results should speak for themselves.    Overall though, I keep going back to this place and have not had any bad experiences.  Mostly it's just a great location, good atmosphere, and decent food that you can feel good about consuming.  It's also great for groups.",

I enjoyed the ahi sliders but didn't feel like I couldn't get them somewhere else for less money and less pushy service.  That said, I think people need to give True Food a try and decide for themselves. It's a beautiful restaurant and having a place that serves healthy, albeit somewhat pricey, food is important in our fast food nation. On the plus side, the Natural Refreshment drinks are delicious. Especially the Cucumber Refresher. But at $4, I wouldn't mind a free refill.

The entree I loved the pizza. Don't forget dessert too. My partner and I loved the chocolate cake. Lastly, don't forget to get your token validated so you park for free! Overall, great dining experience and left feeling satisfied. Would recommend to everyone.",

    "text": "Will you like True Food? Well, it's great for people who are looking for \"clean eating\", whatever the hell that means to you. That is, it's great for posers who don't really want to do the work to eat well or stay fit, but want to feel better about eating out or eating junk at home (loading up on sweet potato chips, antibiotic-free fried chicken and frozen greek yogurt).   Ultimately, True Food is wildly overpriced and not very good. I've joined friends here for lunches and dinners, not by choice. I've had the pizza (hurray for me, it's \"veggie\"), entree salads (hurray for me, I'm eating salad), tacos (hurray for me, it has organic beef) and rice bowls (hurray for me, nothing's fried). I've yet to have a good dish here that was filling and/or worth even 1/2 what they charge. Best thing on the menu is the hummus appetizer, and there are dozens of places in town who do it better.  If you want to eat healthy, prepare yourself healthy and great tasting food at home. If you want low-cal food that tastes great, walk over to Seasons 52. If you want food that tastes great and don't care about \"appearing\" healthy, there are a million places in Phoenix/Scottsdale I recommend -- read my reviews if you care to.",

I am on a diet so I have to find something low carb and they had this amazing salmon that they prepared with a cauliflower side dish. It was delicious and I didn't feel guilty afterwards. I believe that the food is all organic and free range meat . My husband had the street tacos and I had to try them and wow, they were even better than my salmon of course.  I recommend those tacos.

There was music playing in the background and a football game was playing on the television above the bar.  The temperature inside the restaurant was comfortable.  My thoughts on the food:  Shrimp Dumplings The shrimp dumplings were visually appealing and served warm on a round white dish.  It was an appropriate serving for one or two guests. The dumplings tasted fresh and were served with a spicy soy sauce.  Inside the dumplings there was a mix comprised of shrimp, basil, mint and red chili.  The dumplings exceeded our expectations.  Red Chili Shrimp We ordered the red chili shrimp based on our server's recommendation and we were not disappointed. This dish was visually appealing and served hot with sesame noodles, gai lan, spinach and shiitake mushrooms. It was a generous serving that provided enough food for two guests and exceeded our expectations.  Turkey Lasagna This pasta dish contained spinach, ricotta cheese, organic tomatoes and ground turkey.  It was served hot, flavorful and the ingredients tasted fresh.  It was visually appealing and provided enough food for one guest.  Lemon Tart The lemon tart was thick, with a dense texture that was softened by the serving of cream on top of it. This dessert was served cold and was large enough for two guests to share.  It was artistically created and the taste exceeded our expectations.",

Not only is the location in a prime spot the food is always on point. No matter the time of day there is always a wait for this heavenly array of super foods. Truly encompassing an anti-inflammatory diet, the menu is filled with flavorful choices. Unfortunately, due to my current diet restrictions my limitations hindered me from anything that I would have loved to indulge in, however my group sure did enjoy the steelhead salmon and spicy shrimp dish. For me on the other hand they were extremely accommodating. Which is always a battle when you are traveling. I would love to see more vegetarian options in the future. Other than that the service was stellar and the food well worth the wait.",

    "text": "5/29/10 Came in after a failed attempt to dine at Zin Burger next door (I ended up ordering only the sweet potato fries there- not good.  Very soggy.).  Nice friendly greeting at the door, and I was seated right away.  (Sad to see TFK's business was much slower than that of ZB's.)  Ordered my favorite, the onion tart, but I also wanted to try something new- the Columbia River steelhead salmon, which the menu promised it comes with shiso (red or green leafy greens), lime, avocado (hold the avo, please!), and cilanto aioli.  It is served on the bread made in-house.  For dessert, I tried the chocolate muffin/cake w/ organic butter ice cream, organic chocolate sauce, and cocoa nibs (!).  The salmon sandwich was excellent!!  Everything that comprised this sandwich was fabulous, from the whole-grain and veggie bread and the lime and cilantro aioli slathered on it, to the oh-so-moist medium-rare salmon, tomato, and the not-so-usual leafy topping, shiso.  It took all my willpower to not eat the entire thing!  I wish I could say the same about the kale salad and sweet potato hash...  The kale was so tough to chew.  However, chewing wouldn't have been such a task if the kale wasn't also very dry!  My salad was pretty rough, so I abandoned it right away.  [I know that kale is SO VERY good for me, but sometimes what's good for my health isn't so great for my digestive system :( ]  I wasn't a fan of their hash in the past, and tonight's side dish didn't win me over, either.  I won't give it another chance.  Another disappointment was the onion tart.  First, the presentation left me wondering who took a chunk off my plate and ate it?  No, this was just how it was assembled and baked, I was told.  Variances, he said.  The exquisite crunch I so loved in this pizza was gone, and so was the flavor.  Very bland.  Another menu item I must cross of my list :(   Oh, but the dessert!!  Very moist cake, which sat on silky, rich organic dark chocolate sauce, with lovely (!) crushed cocoa nibs- loved that crunch!  I think I surprised my server by guessing correctly what those nibs were!  (I've had them before in trail snack bags from Whole Foods.)  The best part?  Why, the homemade butter ice cream!  I need to go back and have another scoop (or two!) very soon...  Excellent service- very informative.  Kudos to my server who never showed impatience after having to answer all of my questions- some of which he had to go back to the kitchen a few times, too!  Thank you very much!",

    "text": "Ok ok what's not like about this place? I'm highly impressed with Andrew Weil's work, and this place seems like an exemplary example of his philosophy. Fresh, organic, local when possible plant centered menu is right up my alley! When we were seated, my daughter immediately read the info/propaganda sheet about the restaurant and squealed with delight because it meshed so well with our philosophy on food..... However, I'm not impressed when young PEOPLE (often called children or worse \"kids\" in our culture) are disrespected. The hostess put two real menus in front of my 13 year old daughter and me, and then she slapped the \"kids menu\" on the table in front of my 10 year old son without even really looking at him or asking if we wanted a child's menu. He and I were both insulted immediately. Unfortunately that feeling didn't improve. We normally don't even consider the child's menu because my children have been treated as \"people\" their entire lives, so they eat real food with real flavor like the rest of us!   Never the less after he slid around the table so he could look at my menu, we did look at both menus because their child's menu actually WASN'T filled with pasta, hot dogs, and chicken strips like most kid menus. It looked like a smaller version of the other menu... almost. For example, apparently children only eat cheese pizza?! Really? Dairy and crust alone with no veggies are anti-inflammatory? That's not what my research shows. How does one expect to start people on a healthy path of eating if we don't start right away. Shall we stick with the old \"four food groups\" concept when we are young and then magically develop a taste for vegetables once we're old enough to understand how healthy they are? That makes no sense! It's just stupid.... On that particular day, however my son had a cold and didn't have his normal appetite, so smaller portions of regular food was appealing to us. When the waiter arrived I asked about their \"kids\"menu. Shaun was nice enough --in an aloof and subtly condescending way. Just for the record I look like the old punk rocker that I am, but don't judge a person by his appearance these days. You don't know my income level or food/health knowledge and experience. You might be surprised. Anyway back to the menu! So I asked Shaun, \"what about your child menu, is it bland and tasteless like most?\" I told him we had raised our children eating the same food we eat, the same food your establishment is pushing, and he assured me that wasn't the case here. These were just smaller portions.    Onward to the show!! --The food. I started with a root and remedy drink and my daughter ordered the kale aid. Both were very good except for the typical over abundance of ice. I wish they had asked if we wanted ice, so we could have made our own choice, but like the kid menu, assumptions were the rule of the day not choice. We all shared the Tuscan kale salad and it was the highlight of the meal. Although vegans beware it is covered in cheese. The salad was fresh and had lots of garlic. I highly recommend it. For my main dish, I ordered the shrimp chili which cost extra to be gluten free. Why? I don't know. It's well documented that the hazards of gluten to the human intestinal wall lining are a likely suspect in inflammation. Seems like a no brainier for rice noodles to be standard. That being said, the chili was excellent. It was well spiced and had lots of fresh veggies. My daughter ordered the spaghetti squash and it was also good. As for my son, it was not his day.... insult followed insult! He ordered a chicken breast, peas and rice. His dish arrived early, so he was out of sinc with our meal. Furthermore, his food was bland and luke warm at best. Just as I feared, the assumption seems to be that young people, aka \"kids,\" can't take flavors so it better be plain. Yuck! We were in sensory heaven, and he got cold, bland chicken. He ate two bites of chicken and half the peas and rice which were also cold. He and I felt as if he was being treated as a second class person the entire time we were there. As for the dessert choices.... Blah! There are so many wonderfully good dairy free and even raw desserts that everybody likes and can eat. The only desserts here that we're gluten free and vegan were chia pudding and scoops of ice cream. Uhh coconut? and nut crusts? Why be so limited? We skipped dessert!   I may try the Scottsdale location because I want options that are of this quality, but we won't be back here. I wish we had just gone down the road to the Whole Foods which has a fantastic food selection! ...... Ahhhh but that's another review.",

They all had an inspiring message such as \"Shine On\" \"Honest\" \"Green Goddess\" \"Truth\". Those messages instantly brought a smile on my face.  The atmosphere was pleasant. The servers were speaking softly and with kindness. This is something I appreciate. The menu was a good mixture Omnivorous :) Vegetarian and Vegan. There is something for everyone. So if you are Vegan you can go there with your meat eating friends too. I liked the fact that it is not strictly vegan or vegetarian but that there is a healthy choice for everyone. The food was delicious.I particularly liked the Teriyaki Quinoa Vegan bowl and the Vegetarian Edamame dumplings with asian herbs and white truffle oil! Yum Yum!  A healthy and happy place to eat for ALL! I will definitely go there again!",

    "text": "Went to True Foods Kitchen for dinner last night.  Had the Kale guacamole and grilled chicken salad.  The guacamole was exceptionally good and worth reviewing. It is one of the best gucamoles I've ever had.  The chicken salad on the other hand was nothing special. Sure, it was good.  But the whole time I was eating it I kept thinking \"I could've made this at home\".  The Green's tasted like they were from a Fresh Express bag and the vinaigrette tasted like the bottled variety.  I will order something different on my next visit.  Edited to Add Update as of 1/26/17: I visited True Foods Kitchen a second time on 1/23/17.  This time I ordered the steak tacos.  The tacos came with a bowl of beans.  I forgot the name of these beans as they were listed on the menu, but they were very similar to pinto beans.  I must say that on this visit, I was very impressed with how good everything I ordered tasted! The tacos were seriously very good!  I devoured them in less than 5 minutes feeling full from 2 adequate sized tacos.  The meat was cooked to perfection and the salsa was perfectly mild with the right amount of flavor.  My friend ordered the mushroom and brussels sprouts pizza and she, too was very satisfied with her meal.  She said she liked how light and airy the pizza crust was and how much flavor the white sauce had.  Overall, I think I will be coming back to True Food Kitchen in the future and getting more of their delicious steak tacos and beans.  It was truly an amazing meal.  I'm glad I gave this restaurant a second try!",

We were seated outside as requested in no more than 5 minutes at a 4-top, which is always a pleasant surprise. I started off with a Moscow mule. The waiter came back out and said they did not have ginger beer and said he could recreate it with fresh ginger and such. It was even better than expected. We split 3 entrees: spaghetti squash casserole, mushroom flatbread and shaved turkey. Everything was excellent. They even split the entrees up for us. Highly recommend coming here if you like good service and good eats.",

Average/decent healthy-ish food for fairly high prices with almost-good service.  Healthy-ish? Well let's say you get a side of kale with that sandwich. Fair enough. But when you get into it...that kale be dragged through the ocean, matey!! Yyyaaarrr! Well not really but it is SALTED like it's from the bottom of Pirates of the Caribbean, rendering that fresh, healthy kale...um, not so healthy after all. She be a salty dog, yyyaaarrr!  Order a juice-based drink. Cool, super healthy, right? Then how about the \"HANGOVER RX\" - YEAH YEAH YEAH BRO! AFTER I SPEND THE WHOLE NIGHT YAKKIN, I WANT A PINEAPPLE AND ORANGE JUICE, Bruce! I swear, I feel like half this menu should be wearing an Affliction t-shirt, Ed Hardy trucker hat, d-bag sunglasses, camo shorts and flip flops. Maybe this is just the reality of Sam Fox and his Band of BMW Brahs. Alpha male goofballs who like to PUT A BAR SPIN ON HEALTHY EATS, BRO.  Granted there's a lot to be mocked at ANY Sam Fox \"concept\". But on the plus side, True Food attempts to stay healthy and sometimes offers a decent dish. I've been pleased with a few of the salads...I've been let down by most of the sandwiches though. The bread they use is often too heavy and not fresh enough. They can't get potato sides right, but to be fair most places cannot. Fries/taters at sit-down restaurants are too cold half the time, and usually over- or under-salted.  The grill items: chicken, meat, fish...good enough. Overall decent quality. However prices, for what you get, way too high. I know what fresh carrot juice tastes like (you serve carrot concentrate, son!); I know what a good house-made veggie burger tastes like; I can spot great-quality Ahi. I'm sorry, but these things are not present at True Food. Is it a step above the neighboring and overpriced Cheesecake Factory and Del Frisco's Grille & God-awful Sam Fox Mexi-Blanco three storefronts down? Yes. And for that, it is a 3-star joint.  Service trends towards more on the friendly albeit not extremely food knowledgeable. Parking is easy peasy. Indoor acoustics a little loud, and some of the tables are too close together, especially if you're 2-topping.  If you want a centrally-located meeting spot with a good parking situation and a hip and healthy LOOKING environment, this is it, chief. A sufficient lunch spot for wealthy ladies shopping on weekdays and office types looking for an alternative to the neighboring steakhouses and chains.  True Food doesn't succeed because it's successful: it succeeds because there's a dearth of good restaurants in the immediate area. Bro.",

We had appetizers of lettuce wraps with tofu which was absolutely delicious because they mixed little chunks of smoked tofu with peanuts. Heirloom Tomato bruschetta with some olive oil and some almond feta. Again absolutely delicious. My mom's entree was chicken noodle soup. My sister's entree was a mushroom vegetarian pizza, and my entree was a sandwich called the TLT. It had tempeh, guacamole, tomatoes, and it was absolutely delicious. Now the food was good, but that wasn't the best part of the whole experience. The best part was the service! The waitress was absolutely flawless. She was able to get me a Diet Pepsi and an order of french fries and even though the True Foods Kitchen doesn't  serve those items, she went next door to a place called The Zen Burger to get the items that I wanted as a part of my meal. I was stunned because I've never had someone go to those lengths to fulfill my needs as a diner and a guest. We definitely recommend True Food Kitchen for anyone who wants a great meal with vegetarian, gluten-free, and vegan menu options - but also fantastic service, a great atmosphere, with both inside and out dining, and some pretty good music. The Jolly Diners rate True Food Kitchen a 5 of 5. We couldn't have been more pleased or had a better time dining outside, under the water misters, with a nice breeze, and great food.",

The dipping sauces are yummy and fresh and the one is gluten free.    I usually opt for the turkey pita which is absolutely delicious.  House made pita and roasted turkey shredded with tomatoes grapes and a yummy yogurt sauce never disappoints.  You can either get roasted sweet potatoes or kale salad as a side which I usually get 1/2 and 1/2.  My favorite entree here for dinner is the squash casserole.  Yummy tender squash covered in a zesty marinade with freshly melted mozzarella is light but satisfying.  I love heart veggie dishes that satisfy more than even a steak or a burger.  Dessert wise I've tried the olive oil cake which is yummy but tiny!! It's a muffin size with about 7 berries.  I could eat 10 of those things.  For take out lunch everyone always gets the kale salad.  I personally really prefer the Mediterranean chopped salad with quinoa.  The dressing is light enough so the yummy pea shoots don't get soggy.  The Marcona almonds and feta are the perfect touch.",

Along with the other two places I have tried, 'Olive and Ivy' and 'Montana Avenue', I have yet to be disappointed by a meal by this company.  I would advise checking out their other places as well.  The service was a bit slow, but the food was really good and good for you.  The drink I got was really different and refreshing called New Moon (pink grapefruit soda water and agave nectar).  They have lots of different drinks to choose from.  I had Ahi tuna sliders and for dessert flowerless chocolate cake.    All of it was really good and I did not feel heavy or that feeling  of needing to sit down at home in front of the television for an hour after eating a meal.    I will return hungry and order some other drink on the list.  After words I might be doing yoga.  The thing with healthy food I find is that you end up trying to keep up with it, and if you are in the Biltmore area I would check it out.  Recommendation: To anyone who is a healthy eater and everyone that shops at whole foods.  To people who are vegans and non alike that just want a good meal come to True food kitchen.",

    "text": "A couple of things about my recent visit.  First of all, I had the Teriyaki Brown Rice, Local Vegetables, Sesame & Avocado with Tofu.  Since I'm vegan, it was one of the options conveniently marked as such.  And it was delicious!  Flavorful and hearty, I truly enjoyed it.  I took my mother here for her birthday, and both my mother and brother enjoyed it.  I've been a couple of times for lunch, and I have enjoyed it, but neither my mom nor brother eat a lot of food that follows this concept.  My brother, a near carnivore, liked the steak tacos, but thought that the tortilla was bland.  We ordered a bottle of delicious wine, and thoroughly enjoyed the strawberry hemp-milk ice cream.  That should definitely become a permanent selection, because I am vegan and I did not see another vegan dessert option.  And finally, the waiters and staff were awesome.  Our waiter was friendly, polite, and incredibly helpful.  I definitely recommend this for anyone looking for some local selections, a unique mix of (mostly) healthier food, and anyone wanting to enjoy a good meal.",

John is an amazing waiter who clearly takes pride in his work. This to me is hard to come by. When you get good service it just makes everything taste better :)  My mom and I are very picky eaters...no oils, no dairy, no wheat or gluten. He was very understanding and didn't make us feel like changing around the menu was a bother (it has to be). He was on top of everything. Anticipated every want or need.   If you eat here, ask to sit in Johns section. It will be a great experience!",

    "text": "True Foods, a name I'd heard seven million times before finally stopping in as a part of my \"AZ Healthfood Tour\", this was my first visit to the Phoenix location and this place had a lot of hype to live up to. Unfortunately my experience left a bad taste in my mouth. My experience started around 8 p.m. on a Thursday night, I was sat by the restroom by a young man that smelled terribly of B.O., myself and the young lady I was with spent quite a bit of time laughing about the \"V.I.P. restroom seat\" we got.....with a dining room full of open seating. We were on our way to a show and decided to have something we could split,as people who frequent the Scottsdale Quarter location, we decided to break our norm and try a Margherita pizza.... we'd come to regret this, as the pizza took much longer than it should have on a night as slow as this one, and when it did show up, it was burnt. Not even a passable \"well done\", just flat out burnt. When our waiter passed back by our table ten minutes later I called for him and let him know the pizza had \"missed its mark\" and was a little over done. He responds \"is it?\", now I smiled because it clearly  was not fit to feed to anything, let alone anyone. He takes the pizza and we are soon visited by a manager who let us know she would take care of it for us, and that she was sorry. Not long after our second attempt comes out, and its burnt.....again.... in their defense it wasn't as bad as the first one but was still not very pleasing. At this point its so bad its funny, so we order our favorite Banana and Coconut chia pudding and jasmine tea, which was exactly what we needed to sweeten our experience up a bit. We decided not to have the rest of the pizza and called it a night. All in all, its not the Scottsdale location, but that Chia Pudding is a highlight. Still a fan of the brand, just cant see myself coming back to this location.",

    "text": "This is why I typically wait until I've been to a restaurant more than once to write a review. Consistency means a lot - I don't care if the service is consistent, but the food should be. Especially if you're trying to sport a \"healthy eco-friendly\" image capable of reaching naysayer-veggie-haters that have only had bad experiences with healthy cuisine. My experience would certainly not have convinced any timid diners that they should try new foods. Which is unfortunate and makes me sad as a healthy food lover.  My first experience in February was absolutely lovely. Went for a friend's birthday and had the private room in the back. I ordered the green tea soba noodles with tofu and extra veggies - simply delicious. Everything I wanted...light, healthy, flavorful and a good glass of wine to boot. Service was spectacular and dessert was delightful.  My second experience really let me down. Fine if the service wasn't outstanding, I can get over my awkward waitress. The wine was fine. The food was not. I ordered the roasted vegetables with farro. Both the veggies and farro were undercooked and barely lukewarm. I don't like mushy vegetables, but al dente would be nicer to my jaw. And PS - those weren't figs. Definitely not figs.  I'd like to go back and try something else on the menu to see if this was just an off night, so for the time being I will deposit this mediocre review in hopes to have my confidence restored next time.",

    "text": "I have actually eaten here about four times already, always with the best intentions of giving it yet another chance, but I just  have never had that great of an experience at True Food. Today took the cake, when the waiter left with my half-eaten pizza to box it up for me and never returned for the rest of the night, neither to refill the water, nor to check on whether my friend and I needed anything else, nor to return aforementioned pizza. Unfortunately at that time we had already paid (which I guess explains his inattention) and I honestly could not remember the guy's face to track him down. But even had the service been outstanding tonight, the food has failed to impress me just about every time. Today I had the eggplant pizza, which was ok but the dough rather tasteless. In the past I have tried the miso cod (ok but not worth the $22 they charge) and some ravioli that were rather unmemorable but have since apparently been removed from the menu (I think they were stuffed with butternut squash). The only dish I have ever really liked is the Edamame Dumpling appetizer - if another friend of mine has their heart set on True Foods in the future maybe I will just have to get 2 orders of those. The decor is nice enough but the tables are too close together for my taste and the noise level inside quite excessive.  All together not a place that I will ever frequent again if the choice is left up to me.",

The mock-tails are deliciously refreshing... light, bright flavors that just taste good for you!  The Husband swears by the crudite appetizer... and even I, who doesn't always love the green things, really enjoyed it.  The curry dish is my personal fave, and the carne asada tacos are pretty darn good, too.  The kids' gluten-free pasta with red sauce, greens (kale??), and lots of cheese is enormous and totally worth the money.    A good stand-by place, especially when we're feeling like eatin' some healthy stuff :)",

The food is delicious, but is uniquely creative and healthy.  The menu is filled with wholesome entrees, ranging from meaty to vegan, and all the options are tasty.  I ordered the tofu scramble wrap, and to my family's surprise it was the best dish ordered (although the quinoa jack cakes, the date-pistachio-espresso-banana muffin, and good ole scrambled eggs and turkey bacon were delicious too).  What tops this place off to a 5-star rating is the great ambience, with both outdoor and indoor seating options, the attentive and informative wait staff, and the innovative kitchen.  It is completely open to air, with the servers working at prep stations.  You can watch them prepare your food, or pull salmon fresh from the icebox to be cleaned.  Amazing.

    "text": "True Food is awesome! It inspires me to dissect their recipes and try to cook like this at home.   True food offers a variety of healthy, delicious choices. We started with the Summer Chopped Salad with a nice, light but flavorful vinaigrette dressing. It was a good mix of greens, snap peas, strawberries, walnuts, and goat cheese. It was a good-sized portion for a starter salad.   I opted for the Spaghetti Squash Casserole with fresh mozzarella and tomatoes. I love it and saved the rest for lunch! My handsome dining partner tried the Natural Pan Roaster Chicken with asparagus, fennel, and farro. It was drizzled with a light sauce and was very tasty. The chicken was cooked to perfection.   So believe it or not, we had room for dessert and tried the Apple-Cranberry Crumble with dairy-free maple flavor ice cream. I should have skipped the salad and had two of these! We also tried the Lemon Cake with Strawberries and Greek Yogurt. That was also pretty good but then again I usually never disagree with dessert.   Other than the awesome food, the service was friendly and attentive. I love the decor as well. True Food Kitchen has an open floor plan (that never seems too loud) and a nice patio.   I would highly recommend! I've dined at True Food several times and have always left satisfied. On other visits, I've tried a variety of their cocktails and enjoyed them. The Teriyaki Brown Rice with Asian Veggies is also great!",

We got there just after noon and while fairly crowded, we were able to be seated quickly outside: we were a little apprehensive about eating outside, but the covered porch had misters surrounding the outside which kept it comfortable.  Our server, Michael, was very attentive and knew the menu backwards and forwards.  The five of us had a mixture from the margherita pizza, teriyaki chicken, turkey wrap, and chopped salad with chicken and it was all great. Our appetizers - the humus as well as dumplings - were a very nice start.  Get the honey lemonade as it was very good.  The food arrived fast, and we all liked how the food was prepared with an open kitchen the diners could see and appeared very clean.  The service was outstanding.  This was my first time to a True Food Kitchen and I'm ready to go back on my next trip to Phoenix or keep my fingers crossed one of these comes to the Houston area.  Give it a try as you won't be disappointed.",

Our server explained the concept of anti-inflammatory foods in a way that was just right (not condescending, just really healthful.) while I didn't love the Kale-aid juice, I did like the concept of it-  I think it needed watermelon and a little less ginger/celery (too much bite) in this drink for my taste.    The food was mostly perfect this dinner!   I highly recommend the turkey lasagna!!! OMG.  Tender and cheesy but not too heavy.  The kids turkey sloppy joes was a hit too.  The Moroccan chicken was absolutely perfect-  crispy skin and juicy meat.   The only two real False notes:  an overly salty miso soup and a too dry almond butter kids sandwich (needed honey.)   Service was outstanding, especially for a busy night and our large party.   Can't wait to come back!!!",

When I tell the waiter he says--Oh I forgot to put that in the notes to the kitchen.   So I waited for my dish, while the others ate.   It came out correctly BUT nothing was done at all--we were on our way to the baseball game.. so I had to rush to finish my meal (we however missed the start) because of the mishap  (we showed up at 5 pm and the game started at 7 pm)   ridiculous      Will not go back again  and if you have food allergies..

As I looked closer I realized that the kale had maggots. Let's just say we will not be returning to this restaurant ever again. I'm pretty sure this was not a one off incident either (at that location). I also found out that they store their produce in the same area as their trash. I let upper management know what I found and I also shared with them that other businesses at the Biltmore were aware that they keep wares and produce in the hallway area with trash. Very disgusted with this place. Many of you probably didn't even notice the maggots in your kale salad because you mistaken it for shredded cheese. Bon Appetite",

It definitely was really refreshing and was not too sweet, I really liked it.  The Wild Caught Albacore Tataki was delicious, very fresh and light, a great choice on a hot summer night.  For my entree I had the Grilled Fish Tacos which were packed with a generous portion, definitely a very healthy take on fish tacos.  The fish was very meaty and tender.  Got to also taste the Moroccan Half Chicken which was delicious.  Loved the sauce and the chicken was just flavorful and juicy.  The Half Chicken is one of the heartier dishes on the menu and it tasted guilt-free and so tasty.  Would definitely have all of what I had ordered again in the future.",

Had to request a straw for my adult beverage that came in a tall glass. Please can we stop with the Straw Wars?! It gets old having to prompt the waiter to do a proper job. Appetizer did not come out first. Had to request child's plate to be brought out early since dinner, and ALL dishes, took over 30 min to arrive. Waiter didn't hang around to improve the situation. Service should be better and more tuned into the group's needs. No coloring menu for children either. Not the most kid friendly place. Disappointing night when I just wanted to relax & not cook.",

I've been happy with their salads in the past, and ordered their chopped salad tonight. While it tasted good, I was disappointed by a few things 1) the serving size has shrunk from the previous times I've ordered this salad. 2) for a $4 up-charge for chicken, they put on about 2 oz of chicken. Seriously? I didn't expect much, but at least give an acceptable amount of protein on a $20 salad (including tax/tip) 3) this is called a chop salad, but there is nothing chopped about it. The pieces of everything were huge, unlike most chopped salads I've encountered, and the spring mix wasn't chopped at all 4) the spring mix must have been old, because I got a number of bad pieces of lettuce. Yuck! Otherwise, the service was good and as I said, the food tasted good. I'd never been to this location, so hopefully it was just an anomaly and/or the way they do things in Phoenix.",

    "text": "I used to give this restaurant very high marks based on the deliciousness of one particular dish (the Panang curry with chicken) and one particular cocktail (the skinny margarita). Both were indisputably top shelf. But lately, the service has gone downhill at this location, and they have also altered the way they prepare the dish (which one should never do when one has perfection).  Brought my daughter there last night for dinner and it was very disappointing. After taking our order, our waitress basically abandoned us. We had to flag her down just to get a spoon - never saw her again after that. Asked the server who brought the food to please bring a chopped jalapeno; she never returned and no one brought the item.  When it was time to pack up, we waited forever for some help, and when we finally got someone to attend to us, it took another century to get the process completed. I'm thinking it's a management issue, but I don't know what's going on behind the scenes there.   The Panang curry had a ton of green beans this time, no broccoli (the broccoli was one of the best parts), underdone potatoes, and just wasn't nearly as \"soupy\" as it used to be.   Sad - such a let down. I'll try the True Food over at Scottsdale Quarter soon to see if it's just an issue with the Biltmore location, or it's it's truly time to say goodbye to one of my very favorite meals in the Phoenix area.",

    "text": "I received an email promo for free delivery so I decided to try them out.   I went online to place a delivery order. The website is ok but seemed to be running a little slow. One person in my group is on a special diet and asked if they could order two hard boiled eggs. I called the restaurant and spoke to a man who asked his co-worker who said yes. I asked how to place the order online for this special request. He said he had no idea and that he had never even been on the website. He said there should be a place to write in special instructions. There is not. The only place is during checkout and it's about the delivery itself. He put me on hold and transferred me to a woman who said they have eggs but only during brunch and only on the weekend. So I asked if it was possible to get two eggs and boil them. She said no.   So I continued my order online. There is the option to add protein to each item and a place check boxes for removing items, but there is no place to add special instructions to an individual item.   I placed the order at 10:52 am for delivery at 11:45 am. I received an email stating the restaurant had received my order. But a few minutes later, I received another email indicating that the order did not go through due to technical difficulties. The 2nd email said I would not be charged but to call the restaurant to see if they got my order. I called and the woman said that she didn't see the order come through. She said I could call back and talk to the manager to make sure I wasn't charged for the order. She said she could transfer me to the bar manager who could make sure they had not received my order.   Bar manager said they had not received the order. By this time it is 11:15 am and so I asked what my options are. He said that bcz the system did not send the order, that the delivery request would not have gone through either. He took my order so that he could give it to the kitchen so they could start preparing it. He said since I placed the order before the restaurant opened at 11:00, that is why it was kicked back to me. BUT that there was an algorythym that might send the order to the restaurant at a certain time before delivery (in this case around 11:20) and that could be why they had not received the order. He said I would have to talk to another manager about how to get it delivered since it would not have generated the request to be delivered.   I spoke with Izzy who said the whole system is new and she guaranteed that the first order was not received and my card was not charged. She suggested that I place the order again online to generate the delivery request. She would notify the kitchen that the order was coming. I was on the website as we were speaking and told her the screen said the current delivery time would be 50-55 minutes. She said that there was nothing she could do because it was on DoorDash's end based on availability of drivers. I asked if she could call me when the delivery person arrives to pick up the order and she agreed.   I also shared with her an issue for one of the items I ordered. Another person in my group has a severe allergy and she was helpful in alerting the kitchen and called me to clarify my request and offer alternative menu items.   After I placed the order with Izzy, I received a text from DoorDash indicating the driver was on their way to the restaurant to pick up the order. Even though they said the order didn't go through and therefore the delivery request was not generated, this was not True. The delivery request was generated with the first order because DoorDash was contacting me saying they were headed to pick up the order for 11:45 am delivery. I continued to receive texts about the status and once I received the notice the DoorDash driver was on her way, Izzy called to say they had picked up my order. The order was delivered around 11:55 am.   After delivery, I received a phone call from a woman saying she was from TFK, asking if my order had been placed and if I had received it. I said yes and she hung up. I received a call from a guy with DoorDash and he saw two orders come through and he was confused. He didn't know if I received my order or not. I said yes and told him TFK doesn't know how the online ordering/delivery process works on their end of things.   Overall, the food was fine but pricey ($19 for 2 fish tacos). It's great that TFK is trying the delivery service but they have a LOT of things to work out. I was dissapointed that Izzy didn't offer any recourse and I think a little bit of customer service could have helped the situation. I don't know that I will be ordering from them again in the future based on the overall experience. While Izzy was polite and helpful, it seems the staff could use more training regarding online orders and customer service (ie: no knowledge of the online wesbite, being told I can order an item but then cannot, etc). The website itself needs some work as does the process for online ordering.",

With beans and red sauce all over my best pair of dress slacks. All things considered, they barely apologized, cleaned up the walkway but left my foot sitting in a puddle of wet food under the table, gave me club soda only when they saw me scrubbing at my dress shirt. Didn't take any money off my total, or offer dry cleaning. When I came out, I had red crusty sauce down the front and both sides of one pant leg (no surprise as my pants were damp the entire meal, as well as the club soda over my shirt). And of course there was the discomfort of sitting in damp/dirty pants, shirt and shoes for 2 hours, and embarrassment of doing this in front of work colleagues...   Thanks for nothing. I tipped but probably should not have.",

    "text": "I'm new in this area and since I came here I had bookmarked True food kitchen. This Friday my husband and I decided to go on a date night here as I'm a vegetarian - this place has a lot of options for me! Hubby ordered citrus skinny margarita (which we couldn't have beyond our first sip and thankfully was replaced by blueberry margarita which was so good!) and I ordered citrus colada which had a decent twist to the already amazing pina colada (I still love my pina colada as it is). The herb hummus was one of the best hummus I have ever had with a side of absolutely delicious and fresh pita - we couldn't help but order for refill which they didn't charge for. I ordered the inside out quinoa burger as I read a lot of positive reviews about the same - I somehow found it really bland with no flavor at all or maybe I just got unlucky. I had to ask for a side of sauce to finish my meal. The sweet potato hash side that it came along with was amazing! Hubby ordered the red fish ( recommended by the server) and found it average - I loved the baby potatoes that it came along with!  Overall we had an average experience nothing exceptional but the only reason our experience went from average to bad is because after we paid off the bill we realized it came higher than we anticipated- upon asking for the itemized bill we noticed that the citrus skinny margarita was still on the bill. The server apologized and made changes for the same but had we not checked...!   Also, the tables next to us had their candles lit whereas since we sat the server didn't even think of lighting the candle at our table.",

Not only does this place have phenomenal reviews but it has plenty of vegetarian options for several people in our group. I made reservations on the same day (Saturday morning) and was able to get a table for 8. We were immediately greeted warmly after walking in, and were seated at a long table in a private seating area in the back. (What a nice perk!)  Drink: I got two cocktails both of which were well-balanced and delicious! They also have a great wine list and beers on tap.  Food: Given that we had a big group, I was able to try a couple of the dishes and I only have good things to report! Some of our table went with the Restaurant Week menu which were dishes right from the main menu. I opted for the Panang curry with Shrimp and it wasn't on the restaurant week menu. It was GREAT! Just as good as any other real Thai restaurants--the sauce was thick and flavorful with a good amount of spiciness. The edamame dumplings blew my mind! It was such an amazing dish that I would gladly take that dumpling over any traditional dumpling any day. My husband got the quinoa burger which he really enjoyed albeit a tad dry. The stir fried shiitake mushrooms were a delight and the pad Thai is a creative twist on the classic with a bright tartness.  Overall, a really great experience! Would try to stop by again if I revisit Phoenix!",

My daughter ordered the Mediterranean Chicken Pita with chicken, which is grilled flatbread, romaine, arugula, pomegranate, house pickle, red onion, feta, harissa tahini.   That one I definitely liked.   I liked the flavoring of the chicken, the crunchy texture of the pomegranate seeds, the feta, and the pickle was a nice touch.  The romaine was wilted but, oh well.   I didn't try the side of the kale salad.  I must admit, this isn't one of my go-to restaurants, but I'd go again when invited by those who want to eat \"healthy.\"",

The steak add on is lean and flavorful. My favorite thing on the menu is the crudite. It's raw vegetables and dip, but the vegetables are straight from the ground fresh, they use watermelon radishes, which I can't find anywhere and crave. I dream about their olive dip, which is creamy, tangy, and never oily. I also love their green juice!",

Although the pad thai has some good intense flavors, I was disappointed with the texture of the noodle (hard and not soft like they should be) and the addition of meat is not worth it (+6$ = 6 medium-sized shrimps). - We had Inside Out Quinoa Burger and asked for extra onion from two different people including our waitress but it never came. Also, our sweet potatoes were burnt... - Sparkling Antioxidant Tea, Hangover RX, and Kale Aid (really sour) were tasty but nothing out of the world. - Interior was fantastic, clean bathrooms.  Give this restaurant a try if you feel like trying some unique, healthy foods. However, I recommend to stay away from dishes that you can get at places you know are good (Pad thai, ramen, etc.)",

I try to be a healthy eater but I love great tasting food and I like to eat out. For someone like me, True Food is the perfect prescription. I frequent the Phoenix Biltmore and Scottsdale Quarter locations and both have outstanding staffs. I cannot remember ever being even slightly disappointed by the food or the service. At the Biltmore location, ask for Kaylee Duffy-- she's the best!",

First off we were seated outside, which my bestie was extremely hesitant since it was 100+degrees outside..so happy to say that their outside patio is very pleasant and Cool. Win!! My Thai bowl was good- I'm new to this No Meat life, so I'm having chicken withdrawals. Chicken, which you have the option to add, would have made the bowl Great! Now to my drink. I was happy. I didn't want to get sloshed, because..hello..no one wants a d.u.i.! So my Wild Orchid was pretty domesticated. It was cool and refreshing. I felt very pretty drinking it. I couldn't bring myself to eat the flower like our waitress Tessa suggested. I'm not okay with eating art.",

True Food Kitchen was on of the few places that had options that would work for me!  I was doing no alcohol, sugar, or caffeine so I ordered the Kale-aid! I wouldn't normally order this with dinner (it's more of a bunch item), but I really wanted something! I always order it without the celery (my least favorite vegetable...gross) and then I add turmeric. I find the taste to be quite good, and I say this as someone who isn't super into juicing or health foods.   For an appetizer, we ordered the roasted cauliflower.  This has got to be one the most flavorful things on the menu! It covered in a really yummy harissa tahini yogurt sauce and topped with dill (l love dill!) plus it has pistachios mixed in for some added texture. It's so good!  For my main dish, I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole. I was going to order it without out cheese because I was eating diary-free during this diet, but I \"forgot.\" I'm soooo glad I had the cheese, it really made the dish. Without it, it would be very bland. I really liked my dish until I tried my friend's Lasagna Bolognese. Wow, now that dish was tasty!",

    "text": "What a wonderful place!  There was nothing on the menu that I wouldn't get along with.  It took me a while to decide because everything sounded fantastic.  I started with one of their fresh squeezed/blended juices (ginger, agave and soda).  It was light, refreshing and REALLY good.  Highly recommend this one.  I finally decided on the tuna sliders which comes with a side of kale salad or roasted sweet potatoes per the menu.  Our server told us that we could get it with 'half and half' sides.  So, of course, I went half kale salad and half sweet potatoes.  The sliders were good but the size of the tuna in each was not real consistent - the reason for 4 stars vs 5 stars.  Another person in our group also ordered the sliders.  For my two, one of my sliders had a really thin piece of tuna and the other one had about a 1/2 thick chunk.  The other order had different size pieces too - strange.  I usually don't order dessert but was really tempted by the 'stellar' Banana Chocolate Caramel Tart as described by our server.  'Stellar' was the perfect description for this masterpiece.  The chocolate crust contained mesquite flour which I found really unusual as I had never had it before.  We visited the Desert Botanical Garden and learned about the mesquite tree/shrub and the guide told us how they make flour from it.  Service was absolutely top notch FANTASTIC!  Our server was super helpful and knew that menu backwards and forwards and knew all the ingredients/spices in everything.   I wish we had this kind of a place in central Illinois!",

It's fabulous!  I am usually there to try to get my week off to a healthy start, but occasionally we have gone on Saturdays during the day after shopping at the Biltmore.

He has since raved about the Kale salad here. A few years down the road I finally had the opportunity of eating here myself.  We had lunch one day and dinner the following day. For lunch I had their Street Tacos with  grass fed beef. They were delicious. Perfect size and very filling. Alongside that I had the Kail-Aid. It was very refreshing and had a nice ginger taste that lingered after every sip. My fiance had the Kale salad and added the Grilled chicken. The chicken was to die for. I had never tasted grilled chicken like that before.   The following night we enjoyed dinner here. I had the Turkey lasagna and my fiance had the Spaghetti Squash Casserole.  I LOVED my lasagna. It was hearty and rich, the flavors blended perfectly. I tried the Spaghetti Squash that was also mouth watering. It had a bit of a crunch to it, which I actually enjoyed. Again it was also very hearty and filling. We split a kale salad that complimented the rich flavors of our main entree.   Overall the food was absolutely fantastic here. The atmosphere is spot on. The service is perfect. I did not have a single complaint except that the prices are a bit high but you are paying for quality ingredients. Next time I want to try the breakfast menu.

I had the Herb Hummus as an appetizer and the Steak Tacos for my entree.  The hummus was delicious.  The tacos were also very good - I would have them again - but they fell apart very easily, which was a bit of a turnoff.  More than anything, you have to appreciate a mainstream restaurant like True Food dedicating itself to using seasonal, locally grown, organic food as much as possible.  That alone will make me return for another meal soon!",

I had a really great green tea drink which I really enjoyed.    The reason for 4 stars?   My main dish, the green tea soba noodles, was pretty unimpressive.  Also the service was pretty bad.  They mean well but they just didn't have it together. Our food took forever to get out to us.  We would have to ask 3+ times to get water, our check, etc.  I will most definitely return here.  For the kale.  Yum.",

The look...it's brash, fresh and it erased 5 years off my age. The vibe....well knows how to get the buzz in the community. Bathrooms....well he takes attention to detail about as far as you can take it at this point. By the way, True Food looks like it defies the recession and rightfully so. Positive Vibe. Kudos to you Sam.  Oh yes, the food. Well, it's a \"healthy\" offering, so I thought...could taste like so much of healthy food, bland, boring and I usually have to go to Jack in the Box and order 2 tacos to feel full. This is NOT case. I had the Turkey Burger. It was downright astonishingly flavorful and filling. The turkey was zestful and spicy. I was pleasantly surprised. Add to that, the side salad with Tuscan Kale....like a first kiss. Anyway, will be there for dinner this week and the fifth star is probably earned on that trip. Again, Sam....you had me at \"hello\".",

This time though we went for breakfast on a weekday.  Breakfast is \"casual\" as the host kept saying, substitutions are not allowed since we were told that dishes are prepared in advance.  You order and pay at the counter for breakfast.  Service was spotty, once seated you are left alone and some parties were noticeably frustrated not to get any table service.  The breakfast menu, like the regular menu, had some vegan options which were clearly marked on the menu.  The vegan smoothies were refreshing, well balanced in terms of flavor and nutrition and the perfect size.  These were the highlights of our meal.  We had the Green Monster (Apple Juice, Carrot, Kale, Cucumber, Olivello) and the Morning Glory (Apple Juice, Strawberry, Coconut, Banana).  The food was forgettable, nothing stood out on any of our three plates but we still left full without the discomfort of a heavy meal.  Pros:  Correct portions, which leave you full and satisfied without being uncomfortable The food is fresh and simple Nice, clean, simple build out in a space that isn't crowded and large enough to accommodate the crowds Cons: Service is unremarkable The food can be a little plain to the point that you find yourself reciting the line \"it's healthy\" when prompted for your opinion.",

The 25 minute wait for a table was well worth it, even though we had scoped out the neighboring competition. The concept is inspiring and the food options excite my taste buds. I am willing to pay a little extra for healthy, sustainable foods- it's the San Fran in me.  We started with the sashimi tuna salad. Loaded with fresh veggies, generous amount of tuna mixed with a light and zesty ginger dressing.   Our main dish was the spaghetti squash casserole which they split for us half with chicken and half without for me, the quasi-sporadic vegetarian.  For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake was delightful. Although, I should have ordered my own to avoid the vulture-like antics as we both inhaled every scrumptious morsel. My learned sophistication reminded me that licking the plate is unacceptable.   Bottom-line: I would come back for the atmosphere, service and ostensible bio-dynamic food!",

    "text": "I had a very adequate experience at True Foods at the Biltmore location. I went here with my fiancee and two of our friends as it was the best option in town to meet a variety of dietary needs. We had kosher, vegetarian, and sustainable eaters in the group. I did like the decor though at points I was worried about the sturdiness of my seat at our table.  The service was very sweet and friendly if a bit slow. I would in fact say our service was almost too bubbly and happy. Enough that we were slightly weirded out by it. However, if you really are that happy then I guess good for you.  As to the food, we ordered several appetizers, entrees, and dessert. My fiance found most of his food to be the better end of ok. I did try some of his items and I must say they all begged for just a hint of salt. Our friends loved everything. I had a mixed bag. My drink was very nice, I had the Green Arnie which was nice if a little subdued flavor wise. I also ordered miso soup to start. That one was a bit of a surprise. At no point on the menu or by the server was it mentioned that it was a red miso soup. For those of you unfamiliar, the kind of miso soup you get at most places is a white miso. Red miso is much stronger and more pungent. While I am do like both it was not what I was expecting. I would not have ordered such a large potent bowl of red miso if I had known. I then had the Wild Ahi Sliders which were really the best part of my whole meal. The fish was fantastically fresh and delicious. I did not partake of the dessert.  Overall, the food was goodish. Though I did spend much of the evening wishing I had some salt for the potatoes I got. Not a lot just a pinch of something. Otherwise, they were fairly bland. My fiancee had the same complaint. Everything could have used just a pinch more flavor.  Nothing was bad or anything the whole experience was simply ok. If it had been significantly cheaper and the service had been more prompt I probably be willing to boost it up to 4 stars. However, the portions are kind of small (other than the miso soup) for what you pay.  I would come here again with some of my groups of friends with needier dietary restrictions but otherwise I don't believe I will be frequenting this restaurant.",

After the first time I went, I came home to Yelp about it, read some other reviews and hesitated, thinking that perhaps I had overlooked things. So I went back. I still loved it. But then I went again just to make sure. And, yup, still delicious.   The pita and hummus was simply amazing. I'm kind of a hummus snob and was surprised how much I liked it. I liked the pizza with shrimp on it. I liked the beef tacos. I liked the salmon sandwich, I liked the turkey wrap, I liked how the kitchen seemed to spill over into the dining room. I loved how open and airy it felt. Like other people have said, it did feel like L.A. But that's not always a bad thing. In the three times that I've gone I thought there was both image and substance.   There were a few items on the menu that I had no clue what they were. I had to ask. The portions are not huge, but I found them to be quite filling. I always get one of the delicious and refreshing drinks too. I like the one made from the blood orange and the one with lots of ginger in it. There was not a hint of chemicals or fake sugar in them, just natural food, the way I like it. Refills would be nice though.  The prices were a little higher, but not bad. I thought the food was flavorful and delicious. I would take people I like here. Heck, I'd even take people I don't like here.",

I haven't had anything at TF that deviated from \"OK\", but for the mid-level prices I expect something a little higher on the tasty meter.   Service has been fine all three times I've visited, but nothing above what I expect for pleasant and expedient service. I always find myself distracted by the women servers' uniforms...I know it's supposed to be some organic cotton or something, but could they have come up with anything less flattering? I really feel for those poor ladies.   I've also noticed that every time I've visited the crowd is about 75% women, with probably 50% of the parties women-only. Not sure what to make of that, but maybe you can have fun playing sociologist and come up with an explanation.",

    "text": "I have been a bit absent from Yelp as I lost faith with some hidden reviews but I choose one of my faves in Phoenix to return with a review. True Food has added a wonderful roasted veggie salad to their menu with a horseradish dressing that is bursting with flavor! Their shrimp curry bowl is very good but lacks spice. For a beverage, you must try the Medicine Man. It's an antioxidant pomegranate/black tea based elixir that tastes like a vacation.! The only reason I don't give 5 stars is the dismissive server attitudes and sub-par service we tend to receive. Overall, I highly recommend!",

    "text": "4 of us arrived on a Friday night, and the place was hoppin'.  We were seated promptly after a 10 minute wait, and since it was Friday night, it was time for a beverage! I started out with a blood mary, and it was great!  Followed that up with a skinny margarita, which was tasty in my book :).  Appetizers: onion flatbread and dumplings.  The dumplings came in a great broth, but the onion flatbread was awesome! Really thin, almost cracker like crust!  Sides: Kale salad - my friend raved about this dish, but I thought it wasn't anything special.  It definitely looked and tasted healthy, interpret that how you will.  Entrees: grilled salmon -- this dish was really tasty! could have used a tad more seasoning, but it was perfectly cooked. I really enjoyed the arugula salad that accompanied it, and the terrific crunch from the pomegranate seeds.  Dessert: The four of us split the cobbler, which was topped with a non-dairy ice cream.  This was surprisingly not bad, especially the ice cream! Great textures.  Overall Food: Good \"healthy\" food, try the salmon and the onion flatbread.  A little pricey, but that's necessary for organic, farm-raised, etc.  The four of us + tip was $150 +.  Environment: it was LOUD, we almost were screaming at each other to be heard.  The decor is modern casual.  Service: Our waiter was fabulous, she definitely lives the Dr. Weil lifestyle.",

    "text": "This place has all the amazing potential in the world. It's a cool concept and I certainly appreciate the plethora of vegetarian and vegan options they have available, but I gotta say: bland, boring, blah.  The hummus was good, but certainly not the \"best in the valley\" as our waiter purported. I ended up adding salt.  My \"LTL\" (veggie version of the BLT) was very bland. I added salt and that didn't even help. My bread was slightly burned and the potato hash that they gave as a side was cold, limp and you could tell it was burned during the cooking process.  The vegan pizza was also pretty boring. It was a combo of olive oil and red sauce. They could have spruced it up with some spices and made it really flavorful, but it definitely left me wanting for more.  I appreciate the charcoal water filtration system that helps eliminate \"water bottle waste\" but I don't know that charging $2 for the table is necessary.  The honey lemonade was good but gave me a tummy ache, and the nojito just had way too much going on (honey, lime, ginger, soda water, etc).  Our service was good, if not a little overbearing, otherwise I would give this place 2 stars. The food is boring and extremely overpriced. Our casual lunch turned into $50, and there was no alcohol involved.  I am all for health and I support the cause, but they really need to do something about the taste of the dishes.",

    "text": "Ive been here 3x. First time, I had the organic ricotta ravioli. Which was quite good, but oh so salty. Almost unbearably salty, and I am a salt-loving girl. I had a hard time finishing it.   The second time, I had a a pretty bland salad that doesnt even seem to be on the menu anymore. I wonder why.    Third time, I ordered steak tacos.   I keep coming back because I want to love it. As you can see though, I havent found something worth ordering twice yet. Bad sign after 3 visits.  I ordered my tacos well done and another server brought them out. They were medium-well which was totally fine with me and I was about to start eating them when our server suddenly appeared, said something about them not being well done, and stole the plate out from in front of me without even giving me half a second to make a decision, and then took it back to the kitchen. When it returned, the steak was kind of chewy.  I guess Im just used to the high quality meat we use at home? The beans that came with it were...just okay.  The honey lemonade was too sweet. I had about 1/3 of it and couldnt handle the rest.   My mom ordered a soup (not the miso) and it smelled great but tasted...flavorless. *SIGH*   I'll probably give them one last try before I call shenanigans on the whole joint.",

Our server was completely fantastic, and even though I really disliked the drink she recommended (the honey lemon ginger with rum), her upbeat attitude was totally worth it.   I'm #glutenfree and went with a pescatarian/no-cow-dairy-eating-person, so we are a match made in heaven for horrible ordering. I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole. She ordered the shrimp goat cheese pizza. I love the menu, because it spells out the ingredients (which are all pretty simple - the whole appeal of the natural hippie simple recipe theme) and lists if it's vegetarian and gluten free. The casserole was SO delicious, I would totally go back once a week to eat that! My girlfriend's order came back with cheese on the pizza, although it wasn't listed. The waitress gladly remade the pizza and apologized. See, I told you she was great!   They also serve Dos Cabezas wine here - a fantastic winery in Sonoita, AZ. I suggest you get a glass when you go there. They are fantastic people and I love supporting local wineries! I had the rasberry sorbet for dessert and the pomegranate seeds really took it to a whole different level.  This place is brilliant, but I'd love to try it again to see if everything else is worthy of five-stars. I hope that the rest of the wait staff is as awesome as the server we had. It's not cheap by any means, but it's worth it if you want TRUE food :)",

The Prosecco was delicious and came in a beautiful glass, the kale salad was amazing (though it was a bit more lightly dresses on the first go around, which was in fact, better), the gazpacho was decent, the squash casserole was cheesy goodness, the farmers market salad was simply good all around, and the flourless chocolate cake was soft and chocolatey on the inside but overdone-brownie-like on the outside.

(Although next time I will ask for no mayo, and was that parmesean on the Kale? Delicious, but I avoid dairy, and try to eat vegan.) Omni hubby went vegan with the steamed vegetables and farro (wheat berries).   A few months back, we had Sunday brunch there, and I had the scrambled tofu and soy chorizo wrap, which was also very good.   My only complaint is the popularity of this place means that there is a wait for lunch, even on a 115-degree day. Also, because of the utliltarian kitchen decor and the crowd, it can be noisy. But the food and the service will keep me coming back.",

    "text": "I love to go out to dinner or lunch or really any meal. It makes that meal a little extra special. As much as I like making a meal into something special, I literally crave to go to some place and feel like I haven't eaten something that just added 20 pounds to my stomach. True Foods did something that I have rarely experienced, I walked out not only feeling not heavy, but feeling better than I walked in.   I admit, I like the unhealthy, bad for you, nasty, ginormous amount of calories, full of not so good for you food. I fully admit to that. I like that good tasting but not nice to your body stuff. I do, however crave something that is a little on the healthy side. Nay. I crave that even more! I would love to go to a restaurant and say, lay some thing in front of me that doesn't weigh me down! Slide me something that will soothe my hunger and tease my taste buds in to nirvana. Yet, that place is such a perplexity of possibility that I rarely ever find it.   Then I come to Phoenix.   A client suggested that on a recent trip to Sedona, when I had a little layover in Phoenix, I slide on over to True Foods. I am a fan of Dr Andrew Weil. I think and feel his philosophy of eating things that are nutritionally sound is quite up my alley many times, and when my client told me about his place, I knew I had to venture forth in to the great unknown to me of Phoenix and have lunch.   Parking, I did so in the back. Need I place myself among such fancy schmanzy cars up front? Nay! I am fine rounding myself around back. But then I nearly stumbled in. Weary from the two hour drive I just slaved over, needing sustenance that would not only revive but rejuvenate my wilting body. Holla! I made my way to the bar for refreshment and refreshing meal. I sat down, about ready to gnaw an arm or two off when I saw the enlightened menu. So many choices, such little room for all of it. I had to choose wisely. I started off with a green nojito. Refreshing indeed! Certainly my taste buds as well as my body were singing high praises!  I settled on a certainly reserved lunch. the Teriyaki brown rice stir fry with chicken. Exciting? No. But it was damn good. Avocado, bok choy and spinach with tender pieces of chicken. Hello! I could have munched all day on that, but to do so I needed a little more drinky drink. Off to the green Arnold, more tea that I thought but the final product placed a happy smile on my face.   What threw another smile on my face? The friendly and smiling service I got not from one, nor two, but from three separate staff members. Nice. I like.   The price was fine, nothing I wasn't surprised about, but really when I left I not only felt good, I felt great. I felt like I was energized and ready to go. Honestly that is a hard thing to find when I eat out. Rumor has it this place is expanding. Um suggestion? Chicago would love to embrace a healthier eating lifestyle, okay... I would love, no LOVE for you to expand out my way. I would fight Andrea R for a spot for first in line, but I know I would win. I can elbow harder.  Okay... I can... but I would be happy to be second in line just as I had a place to have some place healthier to eat.",

    "text": "Wow, I really am disappointed that it took me so long to come here.  To be fair though, I didn't want to try it until I read their breakfast menu, where practically everything looks delectable.  In any event, we have been here for breakfast a couple times and I have enjoyed it immensely both times.  On our first outing I got the blueberry quinoa johnny cakes and the mango/pineapple (or something like that) smoothie.  The johnny cakes were so good and so filling.  It was served with REAL maple syrup and complemented beautifully with a dollop of greek yogurt.  There was way too much for me to eat and it kept me energized and full for hours.  The smoothie was wonderful too, but a little pricey.  The second time I went with the 2 egg breakfast that came with turkey bacon and sweet potato hash.  The eggs were surprisingly greasy compared to all my other stuff.  They still tasted good though.  The turkey bacon was surprisingly good to me, and I don't usually go along with \"substitutes\" like that.  The winner of the plate was definitely the sweet potato hash.  There was some seriously awesome caramelization going on in there and the potatoes were perfectly sweet, only made better with a little bit of salt.  After my two visits have clearly shown me that healthy food does not mean bad tasting, I am much more inclined to try this place for dinner sometime.  I am also intrigued by the philosophies of the co-founder Dr. Andrew Weil and I would like to experience more of it through the culinary delights at True Food Kitchen.",

I always start with the vegetable crudite. It's a nice bowl of yummy vegetables served with two sauces. I had the albacore tataki which is good but cost about the same as my huge bowl of veggies. I have had a couple of their salads which of course are so delicious that I am drooling as I write this. My finance got the street tacos which he thoroughly devoured but after we left, he was still hungry so portions are small and the price is large. We had two desserts, I don't remember what they were called but his was a lemon bar or pie of some sort. He loved it and I had a berry cobbler with frozen greek yogurt. Yum!!!",

A little expensive (not too bad), but worth it if you want tasty, healthy food that is a little special, but not so rich that you fill sick afterwards. (healthy, fresh food can be expensive, even if you cook your self)  I've enjoyed everything I've tried, but I especially recommend:  Edamame Dumplings (like edamame ravioli with truffle oil; so delightful and light) Turkey Bolognese (filling entree if your hungry for brown rice pasta) Crudites: Perfectly al dente veggies  Salads: Liked all of the ones I've tried!

The summer menu is still in full swing, which is cool since it's still 108 outside.   I ordered the ancient greens bowl with tofu and the server was telling me how it's a new item to their menu and that it is really popular. I can see why, it's awesome! Loaded with superfoods like quinoa, avocado, and shiitake mushrooms, this bowl is complete and packed with flavor. I don't even like mushrooms (it's a texture thing) but these babies were divine!  I also caved and ordered desert (sorry hips!). The lemon tart is nothing short of amazing! Seriously, do they sell this in a fat guy version because it was so good, the large slice they give you, though plentiful and generous isn't enough for the fat boy in me. Lol. It comes with a coconut whip and blueberries. Ugh, so good!   Everything I ate was vegan and therefore responsible (sorry to get preachy on ya!) but I'm so happy to see more vegan options at this joint...can't wait for the fall menu!!!!",

If it's your first time here, they can give you a little spiel about Dr. Weil!  We went for dinner twice and tried: Herb Hummus Wild Caught Albacore Tataki  Braised Bison Short Rib Butternut Squash pizza with GF crust Sustainable Petrale Sole  The tataki was soo good! I wish it came with more pieces. We were licking the sauce off of the plate. The herb hummus was meh, pretty standard and something I could have made at home. Of the entrees, we both liked the bison short ribs the best. They were so soft and meaty.  The space was a little too \"cafeteria\" like for me with all of the tables so close to each other, but other than that I really liked the offers they had and their service. Our servers both times were GF themselves, so it was so easy for my GF dining partner to get recommendations.",

I have to commend the manager, Ari, as well- she came over and made sure everything was flawless. Service was incredible, and we all truly enjoyed the environment and the evening as a whole.

So many fresh, healthy options available, and they are so accommodating of vegetarian and vegan diets, BUT also have good options for carnivores (my huz is obsessed with their grass-fed burger). True Food Kitchen was a game-changer for me when I first tried their kale salad years ago. It was the kale gateway for me, and ever since, I have sung the praises to people who \"don't like kale\", that if they tried salad they would change their mind. I even found their recipe for the salad online, and have made it a million times at home since.... but I still keep coming back and ordering it here. I can't recommend True Food Kitchen enough... this is a happy place for me :)",

The Biltmore Fashion park is easily one of those locations. Accessible from SR-51, a plethora of great dining establishments, and convenient parking - this is definitely a great place to congregate.  This time around, we chose to dine at TFK for dinner with some friends. We chose to dine outside, seeing as that it was a busy Saturday and the noise level was a little elevated inside.  Except for the mister residue that was all over the seats, we chose the ideal location to enjoy a dinner and the company of friends.  The service was prompt, attentive, yet unobtrusive. It allowed us to catch up without being interrupted every few minutes. However, our drinks never went long without refills.  Because our friends were running behind, we decided to open with the Minestrone soup. It was light, yet delightfully tasting as always.  For our main courses, I ordered the Sustainable Sea Bass. My wife ordered the T.L.T. Our friends ordered the Margherita Pizza and the Grass Fed Burger. This gave us a wide breadth of samplings from their menu.  Not even one of our meals disappointed us. All the ingredients tasted fresh. Although some of the flavors did take some time to get accustomed to, it lit p all our palates.  To close it all out, my wife and I shared the Flourless Chocolate Cake, with Vanilla Ice Cream on top. Its tempered sweetness rounded out our well plated meals. It was such a nice surprise.  We've eaten here many times since then. And thoroughly enjoy their offerings each time we visit.   I figured that after all this time of patronizing TFK, it was about time that I reviewed this fine establishment.",

They serve food based on celebrity doctor Dr Weils alternative medicine and theory to avoid foods that cause inflammation. I went to the Biltmore Location in Phoenix. This location offers indoor seating, bar seating and lots of patio seating. Indoors the tables are somewhat crowded and is very busy with lots of noise and music.  I came here to try the Redfish Special off the limited time offered Summer Menu. WOW! It's really great! Got a generously moist meaty delicious Redfish and the most amazing corn......I think the corn was the best tasting corn I ever had in a restaurant. It was like they picked it fresh from a farm. I can't believe a 480 calorie meal could be so delicious and so satisfying.  My husband picked the Spinach Mushroom Pizza also off the Summer Menu. He was surprised that the crust was better than he thought it would be. The mushrooms on the pizza were super flavorful but the spinach was just served wilted. My husband miss-read the menu description and didn't realize the ricotta was almond and not milk.....got a little grumpy from that.....he said that he doesn't like this vegan cheese so he was scrapping it off.....But I suggested leaving a little cheese on to hold on some of my dishes delicious corn to make the pizza tastier and it did become tastier. He turned happy and said Fork over some more corn!  Our server was really great. She gave us the best service.",

It is a very clean and modern location with relaxing and welcoming vibes all at the same time. The staff is very friendly and my friends and I were constantly checked on throughout our visit. Just to give you an idea how nice the staff was, my friend and I arrived at 5pm and left only because they closed! Not once did they ask us to leave, which would have been fine; instead, they wanted to make sure we were comfortable.   The food is very creative with a mix of healthy and flavorful. Recently my friend and I have been addicted to the Chicken Sausage Pizza. First, my friend eats like a bird, but when it comes to this pizza she destroys it! Second, she refuses to go anywhere and eat anything that is remotely healthy, but she's visited this spot two times in one week! We even asked for extra chicken sausage toppings and we received it with no extra charge. Lastly, the cocktails are just as good as the food and I can't wait to have another Cucumber Collins and Blueberry Martini. Overall it's nice to visit a place where I don't feel entirely guilty for eating a pizza. If you're looking for a similar feeling, hit up True Food.",

On this visit, I tried the TLT which is the tempeh, lettuce, and tomato with avocado on whole grain bread. It's a vegan take on a BLT sandwich. While smoked tempeh is not exactly like bacon, it's a good substitute if you're plant based. My dinner date ordered the cauliflower polenta bowl and she loved it.

Loved that the pita was ultra thin. Then there's the cauliflower polenta. It was good but small.",

The outdoor patio was gorgeous with a border of beautiful flowers surrounding the perimeter of the outdoor seating area.   We ordered the Hangover Rx which was basically a concoction of coconut water, pineapple, orange and honey. Would strongly recommend this! It was so light and refreshing. For starters, we got the kale guacamole with grapefruit, cilantro, sunflower seeds and light crispy pita chips. This was the first time that I've had grapefruit in guacamole and loved it!   For our main entree, we ordered the margherita pizza and the inside out quinoa burger with a side kale salad. The margherita pizza was also light and flavorful with its crushed DiNapoli tomatoes and fresh basil. The inside out quinoa burger was also good with the quinoa patties serving as the bun. The kale salad was light and refreshing with a hint of lemon.",

There is indoor seating, bar seating, and outdoor seating.   My friend had the lasagne and I could smell how amazing it was from across the table. She is Italian and loved the sauce. It was unique because they had the sauteed spinach in the lasagne.   My other friend had the chicken sausage pizza. It was the perfect size and good amount of protein. It lacked a complex flavor layer. He dipped it in my friend's lasagne sauce and that made up for it.   I had the kale salad and it was so flavorful. It had lots of different texture and it tasted so fresh. It was bit so I have some to take home later.   We finished with the key lime mousse. It was so so good and perfect to share. The graham cracker bottom made the dish.   We all got refreshers drinks, so 3/however many there are are amazing. I wanted more, but they are $5. So worth it once but not a refill.   We found out about this place because of a podcast by the owner who is a doctor. 100% worth it. I want to come back tomorrow.",

My wife had ordered in and out quinoa burger. It was missing seasoning a bit. Hummus had raised the standard up high. I had ordered Mauritius island redfish and it was really good and well seasoned. We tried cocktails instead of wine this time. She had Citrus Colada and she loved it, I don't like coconut much so I found it okay. I have ordered Citrus skinny margarita and I didn't like it at all and had requested to get a different one and the waitress suggested to go with blueberry vodka it was nice better than the previous one.  Less star coz the lamp on the table was not lit and when we received the bill she added the drink which we have returned. We were almost leaving then realized it looked slightly higher that's when found she added the drink price as well. She apologized and corrected it.",

    "text": "Walked by many times. Finally tried it with a visiting hometown friend. So here are our thoughts. Nice concept. Trendy. Music is kind of loud. Decent menu. Everything is modifiable and made fresh. Lots of vegetarian/vegan. You can eat healthy! You'll quickly lose it on adding in on beer, wine, cocktails.  But there are plenty non-alcoholic beverages so to each their own  My friend joked:\"Hey - did you see each item has calories listed? This means you're not getting food. \" Me:\"Not a lot, at least.\" lol It didn't really turn out to be a joke.   We ordered roasted Brussels sprouts appetizer that came Asian styled. I like the firm crunchy sweetness of roasted Brussel sprouts and I love mushrooms but it was over-sauced, salty, and too much umami. Where it leaves your mouth/taste buds kind of puckered.  My friend ordered this seared chicken breast over broccolini, edamame, olives capers in a tomato sauce. He said his food was decent. He took a picture to send to his wife to show that he was eating healthy.   I had the poke bowl.  The waitress looked at my face when she delivered the poke bowl. She said I looked quizzical? I said no it's fine. She double checked. I sent her away. But my friend started laughing because there was a very small portion of poke over a much larger bed of rice. There was a few strings rainbow radish garnish and a very slight amount of English cucumber rounds with some pickled ginger. There was sauce on the side. About 1/8 th of a diced avocado.  While flavorful, All I knew was to eat very slowly and drink lots of water to trick my stomach into thinking it's full.  I also choked down the rest of those brussels sprouts so I could discount my feelings of not being satiated.  They tried to woo us with flourless chocolate cake, a chia bananas foster or a butternut squash pie. Decided against it.  Our bill came to about $25 -30pp including tip.   Once is enough for me. I'll be going back to Flower child even if they don't have pizza or adult bevies on their menu.",

Thick pieces of toast, eggs were prepared well there was not a lot of Gouda on it (but hey it was only 550 calories) vegan chorizo bowl had good flavor, avocado, sweet corn and beans served with corn tortillas.

I love the green tea here, it's so refreshing and has a great flavor without being sweetened. Our appetizer of the edamame dumplings came out super quickly, it was the first time I got something besides the kale guacamole (my favorite). The dumplings were delicious.

We got enough food for around 30 people and they had it ready in a timely manner and it didn't even cost an arm and a leg! Staff was very friendly and helpful, even rectifying a small mistake for our order immediately, that's what I call great customer service. Even the inside of the restaurant is well taken care of and tasteful. I would definitely be back, the highlight would have to be their gluten free pizzas, which were a hit! Thanks guys!",

We said we would share a salad to start and they brought it already split, with both of us getting quite a large amount.  I ordered the bison burger with all of the fixings on the side.  It was recommended medium and it was perfectly cooked.  The sweet potato hash made it impossible to finish the whole burger. We had a 25% off coupon only good for the 4th of July.  Fox concepts sends them for most holidays when you sign up for their email...will try there new seafood Ola e on the next one!",

    "text": "If I were basing this review on taste alone, I'd give True Food five stars. But this review is based on more than taste. It's based on price, because I'm a broke college student who wants to eat healthy without going bankrupt.  That being said, if you're into the health food scene and enjoy spending $10-$20 on a main dish, this place is for you. Which makes Ture Food a place I ask my mom to take me when she and I go out for brunch.  Many of their dishes are delicious (namely the shaved turkey sandwich, sweet potato hash, and soyrizo breakfast burrito), but could also be re-created at home with a small amount of culinary skill.  I do really respect True Food for also locally sourcing all of their food, and for being vegan-friendly and gluten-free friendly, but there are certainly smaller restaurants around Phoenix where locally-sourced food is offered at a cheaper price.",

I love the idea of eating locally and I realize it is a bit more costly to do things that way, but after a $60 dinner (2 drinks, 2 meals, 1 dessert), hubby and I shouldn't both still be hungry. The food we DID get was awesome- I had a chicken sausage pizza and hubby had some sort of seafood soup. The dessert was flourless chocolate cake and it was delicious, but $7 was a bit much for a round cake that was quite a bit smaller than your average cupcake and a golf-ball sized scoop of vanilla-caramel ice cream.  The service here was awesome and they happily accommodated our group of 18. It was pretty empty when we came in, but crowded by the time we left. The decor of fresh fruits and veggies, clean lines and Asian influences was great except that one of my friends ended up with a fruit fly in her drink.",

The kale salad is great but the salmon we ordered on the top was raw.  The service was wanting.  It took 15 minutes for a Latte to arrive even though the place was half empty.  To top it off my granddaughter did not want the salmon by the time it was offered and the waitress brought a piece of cake which was good.  When I questioned the bill because they charged us for the salmon I told the server it should have been removed from the bill.    Why didn't a manager come by to ask?   Seems like the restaurant needs a manager who sees to it that a repeat patrons are properly treated.  Our waitress (6 weeks on the job) was surprised when I refused to pay for the dish.  I was charged for the salad.  We don't mi d paying for quality.  A manager never appeared.    I have never experienced anything like that in a Fox Concept Restaurant before.  They are usually on the ball - but now a favorite place is in decline.  What a shame.    We like this place and would like to come back, but this needs a fix.  Hopefully Sam will make that happen.",

We had a good meal...I ordered the shrimp dish and was warned by my server that it was \"very spicy\".  I'm a native so I am not intimidated by that at all.  It was yummy but distinctly non-spicy.  It came with noodles and I brought half home with the intention of doctoring it up for another meal.  My friend ordered street tacos and another enter.  She was hungry and said the tacos were good.  We had a gift card, so had dessert---a really strong, but tasty, lemon tart and a yummy frut crisp .  Our service was polite and they were tolerant of our very long visit.  I'msure the generous tip didn't hurt, either.  So, after my second visit, I am still not blown away by True Food   The menu has some variety but things like street tacos can literally be found everywhere.  I think I have an expectation that the food be healthy , unique, AND creative, especially for the price .  This is a really competitive food town.  The way for True Food to distinguish itself is to innovate and give the diner value .Once that happens, I bet more folks will place it in their regular rotation.",

I had the burger for example, which is bison meat. It was every but as juicy as a beef burger and had a great kick to it. They have all kinds of foods, including tacos and Thai dumplings, which I had for an appetizer. These were decent, but not the best.

At least this is what True Food Kitchen would have you believe.  Naturally I went here with a good friend of mine for lunch. We had a short wait to sit on the patio. We started with the hummus appetizer. I was not impressed at all, granted I am a hummus snob (Go Sabra!). The Pita slices could have used a nice grilling, and the veggies were pedestrian.   For my meal I had the Ahi tuna sliders. It came with a sweet potato hash. The sliders were small and the ahi was a bit overdone for my tastes, the wasabi mayo covered the overdone nature of the Ahi. This is where I again question this healthy nature, copious amounts of mayo is not healthy when compared with the option of properly seared ahi. The sweet Potato hash was acceptable. The meal left me hungry however.  The Organic Service was sub par, and the exposed tattoos and odd hair colors of the wait staff seemed unbecoming of a place with prices this high.   Given a choice of Fox restaurant concepts this is not my first.",

The beauty of this spot is that they also serve beef, fish, and poultry for the carnivore/omnivore in your party. Other restaurants like this often don't cater to those who like meat, which makes this spot a 5 star in my book!",

The only down side is it is very expensive i think. But it is in the Biltmore so that ups the price. You can have your car valeted, or park in yourself in the nice cool parking Garage in the back. I opted for that.  It was started by Dr. Andrew Weil and the first time i went there with my friend Kris, he was sitting right next to us at a table.  It is a very nice place to go when you want to have a lovely relaxing lunch and really enjoy yourself.",

    "text": "My sister and I finally got to get some quality time here when we were on our recent \"where won't the carnivore go eat out week\".  We went early on a Tuesday and were glad we did because before we left it was full to the brim.  Although the space is wide open, sound is kept to a minimum so even when they are overflowing you can still have a conversation.  The food is has been covered but let me add in my vote for the inside out burger, which is a flavor explosion of tangy, tart, spicy, and sweet in one crunchy bite.  Because the \"bun\" is actually the quinoa patties, it is a fork and knife event and pure bliss.  Dinner ended with a shared portion of the squash pie which comes with a side of the cocunut whipped cream and let's just say they should just sell big bowls of that cream.  It is light and airy just like the fatty traditional whipped cream but it has a delicacy that is not in it's heavy counterpart and the subtle infusion of the cococnut... well let's just say I could eat my way out of a bathtub full of the stuff.  I completely agree with Matthew K on his callout on the liquor. It seems very odd to me that you can shot up your smoothies considering their \"healthy style\" but who am I to argue with the anti-inflamatory king, Dr. W?  But that said, the wait staff was so extraordinarily friendly and attentive in a non-creepy (i.e., please go away) sort of way that I quickly lost traction on that rant.  Luckily after giving the menu a full once over, we decided the carnivore would be satisfied with the choices, so we will definately be back for some more of the kale salad goodness. :)",

She was super considerate of my daughters peanut allergy and even looked up the ingredients for the bison burger, including sauce to make sure it was something she could eat. Who knew bison might be an issue?! We started with the edamame dumplings. They were interesting. Daughter liked them but they weren't my favorite...pass. I ordered the Mediterranean chopped saled and it looked really awesome! Sadly, it tasted like dandelions. Seriously. I feel bad because I'm sure that's all healthy and wonderful and blah blah blah but it was just yucky. Yes, yucky is absolutely a technical culinary term. Anywho, not my thing, two thumbs down... It was super busy at lunch time and people obviously love it...just wasn't my thing. If you're looking for overpriced 'healthy' fare, check it out! I'll be at happy hour down the street ;)",

    "text": "True Foods you are going downhill. In particular this location. I am a regular on average 5-10X per month depending on what I am feeling. To give an example of how service and food quality is declining. I show up me and my book tell the server I just want something light and quick. We discuss soup and 1/2 sandwich is possible and a drink done  awesome. Soup is good, then comes out a pizza- I tell food sever I didn't order a pizza she/ probably manager looks at me confused and says what did you order. I ordered the tempeh sandwich. Ok cool I go back to reading my book. Out comes my original sever asking me why I didn't want the pizza. And I get slightly annoyed as I know what is going on. He forgot I I'm sure to just place the order for the Sandwich and long story short looks at my crazy as if I changed my mind. Ok whatever no biggie I get it and I move on... I don't take it personal perhaps it's he is new and his manager bugging him about it. Out comes my tempeh sandwich with tofu instead of tempeh. I ask what is this? Thinking they changed the menu and I missed it... ummm her reply is it's still vegan and it's tofu and we don't have tempeh right now. Really?!?! 1. I'm not 100% vegan and 2. I know what tofu is but whatever. 3. In my head why didn't he tell me this when he placed order 4. Whatever in my head I am saying and I am  moving on again. I take 1 bite of sandwhich and it tastes like crap. Literally I make tofu soup, stirfrys etc at home and this was no bueno. Here is the annoying part... no one said we messed up ever. She apologized but after the fact I had to get up and ask why is there tofu instead of tempeh. Waste of $ and time is what this equated to. True foods better step up their game as other restaurants are popping up that offer better food and they will loose customers. Probably will not be coming to this location again for a minute just based of service. Food is whatever s*** happens. I'm no-self entitled jerk but with my kindness and humility they still treated me like crap. Try True Foods but if the service is sub par don't say I didn't warn you",

We have lost a lot of weight and thought perhaps they will have some healthy options otherwise there was likely no way I was getting my caveman husband to consider this place. Being in the Biltmore doesn't help as all the plastic, Botox joker faces walk around with their snoots in the air. We were greeted at the door by Jordan and Scout two of the friendliest hostess staff I have met.  They encouraged us to try a drink from the bar while we waited for a table. My husband went to the bar and returned with an Old Fashioned that was simple delish. He reported the bartender Chris was absolutely the nicest guy ever. He the turned to greet Scott the assistant GM who also was super cordial and welcoming. In short order our table was ready and Scout brought us over. Our waiter was Mike down to earth and pretty laid back provided great customer service and explained the concept of the food. We ordered starting with hummus.  Umm...yea it was awesome. I ordered steak street tacos and the husband lasagna. Both of them were really good. The beans with the street tacos had a great flavor. The lasagna was really good we enjoyed it a great deal will have to come back for it again. We chatted with the floor manager Arianna for a long time and she had a dessert brought to the table the flourless chocolate cake and it was like wow yummy. It was not low fat for sure but it tasted so flippen good. We will definitely be back we only think one thing would have added to the meal and that was filtered water. Phoenix tap water is not so tasty. We loved it!!!!!",

The drinks are suppose to be good but to me they are rip offs (yes. Half of the cup are ice so you are paying half cup of juice not full cup). When ordering starters,  make sure you ask about the quantity we had 4 people and order the 9 dollars ADAMAME dumpling and it was only 3 small miserable pieces and it taste just average (it was a rip off for $3 dollars each).

PLUS, they change their menu items with a few staples that remain unchanged).    I've never tried their pizzas, but I can attest to their salads and sandwiches and entrees - the one that stands out the most is their Sashimi Tuna which was surprisingly filling (the fat of the fish and avocado) and not-surprisingly, very full of flavor and my favorite, ginger.  Their Steak Tacos were also fantastic and I love the cotija cheese they put on top and of course my other fave, avocado.  Their price point is competitive considering they serve premium ingredients and the food has never disappointed.  Also, servers are (cute enough), wearing matching capris and such and have always been friendly, down to earth, and prompt.  I enjoyed the outdoor patio that the Scottsdale Quarter location has better than the Biltmore's, but this place is still very enjoyable... I just hate the parking dilemma since it's so popular on a any night of the week.",

Super fresh and had maybe olive oil and pramasan drizzled on it. Oh I also asked our sever for some hot tea and she offered some lemon, honey, ginger tea. LOVED IT! This was a risk for me because I don't like the taste of ginger but it was masked by the honey lemon goodness. Sorry I'm not sure if the name of the tea. I'll definitely come again and see if I have any better luck with another entree and most likely pick up some tea even if I'm just in the neighborhood.",

They no longer have this pizza or any vegan pizza options. We won't be returning until they again support vegans. Also, the prices are quite high for the quality of food. There are many other great option in the area.",

Highly recommend stopping in even if it's just for a drink and small appetizer. Awesome shopping area surrounds it too(:",

He tells me 3-5 business days...A 15 minute correction (originally what I was told) turning into a week thing is frustrating and to top it off there was absolutely no offers or compensations of how they could make up for such a huge inconvenience:/ Won't be going to that location again.",

I will clarify my rating to say that overall, this location is better than the one in the Scottsdale Quarter.   On one hand, I love the healthy concept, I love the look of the restaurant, and I love the menu choices. One of my favorite menu options is the Vegetable Crudite. I also love all of the salads.   On the other hand, the cooked food is just never prepared right. Last time we were there I had the salmon. I asked for it medium and it came well done and with no flavor. I had a similar problem when I ordered the sea bass and it came smothered in heavy umami sauce. Another great idea is the bison burger, but that came dry, overcooked and salty.   If you want to enjoy True foods order something that isn't cooked and you will, but otherwise you might find your visit disappointing.",

I could tell that she was tired and ready to get the hell outa there.   We were sat right away a week from today on the patio. Upon being sat we noticed that they were nearing closing time. I ordered the medicine man drink and we started with a vegetable crudites but substituted the hummus. The server forgot to sub it but it was remedied right away.   I did, however, love my medicine man drink.   To follow I got the chicken chopped salad. It definitely was an amazing salad. I loved the sweetness of the dates along with the sharp flavor of the champagne vinaigrette.  Nearing the end of our dinner we were offered dessert. Normally one would wait until the guest is all finished but we weren't too bothered. We were full anyways! haha. I thought it was a nice gesture of the server to offer us free food and drink that was going to be thrown out anyways. I love how they try not to waste!",

I'm really big on eating healthy and this place has healthy foods that taste absolutely delicious. (Please try the bison burger). The reason I gave 4 stars and not 5 is because on one occasion the red chile shrimp came out missing an ingredient and tasted bad, although, it was taken off the bill. Secondly, I strolled in after the gym for a lunch time meal and they shut down food production for a kitchen malfunction. But in the scheme of things, I love True foods and its concept. They have really nailed delicious healthy food on the head and even my boyfriend who is a meat and potato kind of guy loves coming here anytime.",

I would ask them to lightly salt if that's an option. Otherwise, everything is charred just right and the taste is wonderful. There are other favorite dishes like the grain bowls. True Foods does not have happy hour pricing, so that's another consideration but their Malbec was quite good. The service can be a tad slower given the freshness of the food and it's a very busy place. My servers have always been friendly and attentive. Indeed I would say their personalities are a primary cause for their four star rating--because they've been mostly fives.",

The ambiance is calm and relaxing. We sat outside in the shade, because it was a nice sun shiny day.  I finally got a Kilt Lifter (Awesome Brew btw). My gf got two different loose leaf teas and loved them.   For food, I got the grassfed burger. Although, I was torn and almost got the turkey burger because the toppings were very appealing. It was DELICIOUS and definitely hit the burger spot I had been trying to fill.  We are so lucky to live down the street from this tester aunt as well as all of the Biltmore complex. I can't wait to try all of their food!",

    "text": "Once upon a time, I ate a buffalo burger at True Food Kitchen, and ever since I stopped eating the meats I've been anticipating another visit.   The menu these days looks really good. With various vegetarian options and vegan opt-ins you won't have to read too far through the items before something catches your eye (and taste buds).   For the most part, True food is prepared with healthful ingredients that leave a clean aftertaste. Much care and precision go into the dishes and the young staff is trained in presentation and pleasantries.  This was a genuinely beautiful autumn afternoon and although there were some cons with the service, I may not have paid full attention so - giving the benefit of the doubt - I won't mark that against the restaurant. It gets a solid 4 stars from me.  - wrong order was promptly corrected - questions were asked about our experience - motions were made to please us  It was just like fine dining. Yes, dining there was just that fine. Fine, let me tell you what I ordered...a couple of plates from the \"Vegetables and Fruit\" section and one from \"Sandwiches.\"   1. Torched Avocado:  slices of blackened avocado on top of cucumber noodles, mushrooms, snap pea, watermelon radish, black sesame seeds, and drizzle of turmeric ponzu.  This is DELICIOUSly savory and I will order it again in a heartbeat.  2. Charred Cauliflower:  florets of cauliflower mixed with medjool dates, dill, mint, and pistachio nuts all covered in harissa tahini. This is good, but heavy on the dates. I don't like starting meals with sweetness so if I order this again I'll eat it last - right before dessert.  3. Quinoa Burger:  quinoa patties (actual grains of quinoa shaped into patties and used as buns) that sandwiched a smear of hummus, tzatziki, tomato, cucumber, red onion, avocado, and feta. I ordered this sans the dairy stuff. No likely. Not for me. Not this lifetime.  4. Vegan Pizza:  small thin crust pizza with skimpy toppings. We added nut \"cheese\" too and without this, the pizza wouldn't have been worth it.    If I could have a do-over, I would order 1 and 2 and request a side of fries to fill me up. Mmmm that sounds good. You might see me at TFK again for another meal sooner than I expected.",

My dining partner had the salmon entree with quinoa, brown rice and farro. The grains had a garlic and lemongrass sauce that was amazing.  Service was prompt and friendly, and the ambiance was casual and comfortable. Noise level was acceptable. Dinner for two with two cocktails was $86.00.

    "text": "In a land full of diners, sports bars, and fast food chains, I was delighted to find True Food, a truly unique restaurant that's both health-conscious and delicious. I stopped in for dinner with my brother, sister-in-law, and nephew on the night before our 7-summit hike. We needed fuel to get us ready.  We each had a fun beverage to start. They have an impressive list of 'Natural Refreshers' consisting of various concoctions of veggies, tea, spices, and fruit. I ordered the Honey Bee Ginger Beer, which is a mix of ginger honey, chai spice, lime, and sparkling water. I like all of those ingredients individually, but wasn't sure how they'd taste together. Was I going to have a 'Rachel's trifle' situation on my hands? Maybe, but I went all Joey on this one and loved it. Very refreshing and cleansing. My sister-in-law had the Sparkling Apple Soda, which was basically apple pie in liquid form. She was a fan.  Our entrees arrived quickly:  Turkey Burger for me, Inside-Out Quinoa Burger for her, Seared Spicy Wild Caught Tuna Wrap for bro, and a pizza for the little one. My turkey burger was pretty good despite the weird tasting flax seed bun. I had a choice of kale salad, sweet potato hash, or both as a side and obvi got both. The kale salad was so satisfying with it's perfectly chopped kale, tart dressing and parmesan cheese. I could have eaten a whole plate of those sweet potatoes. Sis and bro both devoured their plates, so I think they liked theirs too. My nephew, who's 2 years old, had a pizza off the kids menu which was ENORMOUS. Easily an adult-sized individual pizza. I think he ate a slice, but luckily it was also delicious so the rest of us had no problem helping him out :)  The ambiance is pretty cool too. It's a large, open, airy restaurant with big windows, exposed stainless steel prep tables, and a big kitchen right in front of you. Service was good, though bro and I both think our server could've let up a bit on the eye-contact-intensity.   Awesome spot overall. Can't wait to go back and try the butternut squash pizza!",

I've heard of True food kitchen but have never eaten at any of the locations. I would give the food here 4 stars, ambience about a two or three star because I'm not really into the pretentious mall dining scene. So let's talk about the food. They have terrific vegan options and the menu is highly based off of an anti-inflammatory diet. I ordered the TLT which is tempeh lettuce and tomato in which the tempeh is made to be like bacon. This sandwich was absolutely delicious! I got it with a side of kale salad which had a light citrusy dressing. Also had the cauliflower appetizer that had a creamy Harissa and tahini sauce. I'll definitely go to True food kitchen locations at other places, I know that there's some in orange county which I'm usually around that area every month or so.",

I like the restaurant design, it's clean and simple.   Now, the food. There are some hit and misses. The onion tart, kale salad, hummus and farro are delicious. The honey lemonade is great, but with no refills it can get expensive.  The chicken, curry plate, spaghetti squash casserole were....ehhhh. Like they forgot to put flavor in them. It tasted like, well, chicken, curry, spaghetti squash. The plate looks great and you expect this explosion of flavors in your mouth. Once you taste it is like a firecracker that fizzles, disappointing.   Also, we had our son with us and ordered his vegetables to be cooked soft and in none of our visits they manage to do it right.  They tried, but for some reason they couldn't?  I had dessert once, I think it was a banana chocolate tart. I know it had chocolate in it. It was good but nothing to write home about.  I guess I like to go to eat to TFK when we are out, it makes me feel healthy. Not satisfied but healthy nonetheless.  *3.5 stars*",

    "text": "Four of us stopped here for a late lunch on 3/19. We were all starving and our first choice, Zinburger in the same shopping mall, was closed for some reason. For a second choice, True Food was pretty good.   It's like all the Fox Restaurants I've been to - open kitchen concept, young staff, loud music with a modern-industrial feel. The first thing the waiter told us while handing us menus was that one of the restaurant co-owners is Dr. Andrew Weil. He went on to explain how healthy and organic their menu selections are. Apparently this is their standard opening line to every customer since I heard it mentioned to other diners around us.   My daughter and I had the raw fish special which was served sliced sashimi-style topped with a sesame-miso sauce alongside thinly shredded carrots and cukes. It was very good with an appetizing presentation. I had the wild ahi sliders. The waiter warns that it's cooked raw. It came with sweet potato hash. The sliders were delicious, slightly warm and very flavorful. The sweet potato hash was tough and cold and had probably been sitting around for too long.   The shrimp dumplings appetizer (you get 6) were also very tasty as was the chicken pizza that our guests had. Hubby decided to go vegetarian and had the Miso Soup and Vegetable Caeser Salad, both of which were filling enough for him.   They also have specialty drinks that weren't really worth the cost. Hubby's Cucumber Refresher was pretty tasteless and my Green Arnie was weak.   The atmosphere was loud and energetic. The kitchen is right there and they don't care if they're banging pots, pans and dishes everywhere. We were there at the end of the busy lunch hour when the restaurant had emptied out and it was still pretty loud.   Service was quick. Our food arrived within 15 minutes of ordering them and they all arrived at the same time. Our waiter was helpful and friendly and he did check on us a couple of times but took care not to hover. It's a good place to eat if you want \"healthy\" choices and don't want to think too hard about it. I don't know that I'd come back here again, especially if Zinburber was open!",

I've eaten here several times and while I've liked the food, I haven't LOVED it and I tend to walk away feeling like I want more. I can't identify what that \"more\" might be, but I can tell that it's missing. Everything has just been \"ok\", with the exception of the spring market salad, which I absolutely *FELL IN LOVE* with.

Wow, the combination was mouth watering after I ate my first piece. Who would have thought pomegranate with hamachi?   I ordered the curry and rice noodles with the shrimp. The dish involved more than just that of which it had perfectly cooked vegetables that brought out the flavor. I was pleasantly satisfied with the texture of the crispy vegetables and the soft rice noodles with a hit of curry. It was one of those dishes where in the beginning you question \"I can't really taste anything\" but then you take a couple more bites and it comes together. You start understanding why the combination of the celery, chards, cilantro with this type of curry and . . . okay I am just going to stop. It's one dish and it did it for me. We also ordered the caramelized onion tart with Gorgonzola and figs. I was not impressed and would recommend trying a different appetizer because there were many appetizers that sounded delicious .   They also offered all these creative healthy juices, which I want to try next time. Overall, we had a great dining experience. Our waitress seemed to be very knowledgeable about the menu and was very helpful in making our choices. This is obvious but I have to give True Food credit for creating yummy dishes using mostly organic, flax, and gluten free. The decor was very open, airy, and Frank Lloyd Wrightish.",

We rolled in to find her sitting in front of a bowl of iced down fresh veggies, and I mean a mixing bowl, not a soup bowl. We ate the whole damn thing.   Followed that with the mushroom pizza. Damn good, no sauce, and tasty as can be!  I even went so far as to clean up my girlfriend's dinner of vegetarian Chinese dumplings and kale salad. It was delicious!  More and more I am thinking about giving up meat. Its going to be a hard thing as I have a deep addiction to meat products, but more and more places like TFK are changing my mind on the whole vegetarian thing.",

I love the organic wine selection as well.  If you enjoy sweet white wine the snoqalmie naked reisling is a must try.  The staff is always very sweet and attentive.  My only complaint is that I'd really love to see the butternut squash ravioli return to the menu when in season, it was phenomenal.",

I'm a sucker for ahi sashimi and this salad had some homemade pickles that were just out of this world. I didn't miss the fact that there was no dressing on the salad. Almond Olive Oil Cake made me curious, and while it was tasty, I will be getting the Lemon Tart next time!",

    "text": "I'm confused a little on this place and here's why.   1)Spiffy new, contemporary interior but it seems more like a fancy Pei Wei than an upscale restaurant. The prep table is in the front of the house, and why do I need to see people cut up vegetables as part of the dining experience?   2) The first thing you see on the menu are fresh healthy fruit drinks then at the bottom of the list they say \"add a shot of vodka for $3\". Seemed very strange to me.   3) We had great service, actually some of the best I've had in a long time, but there were easily 10+ staffers hovering around as you walked in which kinda made it like I had just pulled into a used car lot with all the salespeople getting ready to pounce on me. I'm guessing there were 30 employees total that night and about 60 guests in the place.   4) Food: Had an onion tart, butternut squash raviolis and a side of fresh green vegetables. Can't complain much food was really good, but in that healthy, locally grown, organic, blah blah blah way.   I like this place, but it's in the Biltmore and I don't typically go here often at all. Food is good, simple and fresh so maybe a better lunch stop with the girls than a hearty dinner destination with the boys.",

    "text": "While I still mourn the passing of the most rad Coffee Plantation ever, its replacement, True Foods, is a quite acceptable substitute.   It's based on some cheesy anti-inflammatory diet by some doctor. Yeah - real helpful, I know. I'm sure there's plenty written about it, so why waste your time and mine rehashing it?  I have been to TF a few times. The decor is gorgeous, and I love the outdoor patio. I met a friend there the other night. He was late (tsk, tsk), leaving me sitting by my lonesome on the patio surrounded by cougars and Scottsdaleites. Some staff member - a supervisor, maybe, as he wasn't in uniform - took pity on me and brought a little kale salad for me to nibble on, gratis. How sweet, but..... kale? Um... OK... BUT... dressed in olive oil, lemon juice, toasted bread crumbs, parmesan cheese, and chili flakes, kale is KILLER! Who knew? Fresh, clean, and delicious. I'm getting the big version next time.  Our server, like all servers I've had there, was genuine, helpful, and friendly. She brought us a bit of the wine we were interested in, an AZ blend, to sample before committing to a whole bottle. We proceeded to suck down the said bottle, without much further ado.  The menu has a lot of options - and that's coming from a vegetarian with a fungus-phobia. I've had something different every time I've gone, and each has been so very tasty. My favorite is the tofu and brown rice - simple, yet flavorful, and generously portioned, allowing for lunchtime leftovers. My companion got some pasta thing with ahi, maybe? Come on, I was drunk. But he seemed to like it just fine.  So, is True Foods just slightly self-righteous with its sparkly clean offerings and slick decor? Well, OK. Maybe. If you can get past this and the crappy parking situation, you are gold. Your liver might thank you for the healthy meal, but you can go ahead and shush it up with one or four of their signature cocktails. Tons of yum! I will be back.",

    "text": "This may be my new favorite!! Everything is trans fat free 100%. The wait was pretty crazy but it was worth it.   The whole feel of the place is really cool. I always want to eat healthy but not cook, never can I get both.   Lots of places claim to be healthy but after several probing questions I usually find a few things that are tainted with trans fat and high fructose corn syrup.   Not here though!!!   Being a lesbian I have a lot of vegan/vegetarian friends. (I guess lesbians really don't like meat) They always want to go out but I find that most vegan/vegetarian places have less than good food. They almost always seem like the kitchen would be all dirty.   I cant wait to take my non meat eating friends here.   Here's what I got   The butternut squash ravioli = awesome! The dough is made I think like gluten free or something, which isn't a selling point for me but it was very good. Usually the gluten free noodles are sick, I actually really liked the texture and taste. Its in a yogurt honey sauce, to me sounded a little gross.  My gf ordered it but it was delicious, it was the perfect sweetness. It was served hot which I thought it may be cold I guess because of the yogurt factor.   I ordered the root veggies. I did really like it but I thought they flavor could have been a little more herby. It wasn't bland but I think the flavor for sure could have been kicked up a notch. The Farro that came with it, was super good. I wish there was more of it especially for 15 bucks.   The bathroom was weird, it was really small. The door was thin sheet metal and so was he lock. When you lock the stall it makes the most awefal screechy metal nose.  The soap was actually a natural soap which was nice but not antibacterial.  Ok, they habd the coolest hand dryer, I mean this thing is bad ass. You put your hands in it like a car wash dryer. I dont know how to describe it but make sure you check that bitch out :)",

    "text": "From a girl who was born and raised in sunny SoCal, when I walked into True Food Kitchen, I thought to myself, \"Wow...this place is so LA.\" Minimalist (yet natural) design, hip waitstaff...it would fit right into Los Angeles. However, True Food is a little too LA: it's all looks but no substance.  True Food Kitchen cooks with a very literal defintion of vegetarian/vegan food in mind, which results in overly bland foods. Probably healthy, but still overly bland.  The brother and I split the carmelized onion tart to start, and I ordered the spaghetti squash casserole as my main entree. To call the onion tart a tart is misleading - It should be described as more of a flatbread pizza (or, in our case, a very charred flatbread pizza), with gorgonzola cheese, figs and onions as toppings. The figs were slightly burnt as was the bottom of the bread, so the taste of onions and cheese was masked by the taste of charred food.  The spaghetti squash casserole was exactly what it was described to be: spaghetti squash with mozzarella, tomatoes and zucchini. It tasted like squash and zucchini mixed with marinara sauce and baked with cheese on top. Nothing more. The first couple of bites were fine, but I got sick of it halfway through.  If you're into very simplistic, healthy food, True Food might be right up your alley. But, it just lacks the flavor and depth of other vegetarian restaurants I've been to and overall, I just wasn't impressed by anything I tried.",

For desert, we shared an apple-cranberry crisp with dairy-free Maple-flavored ice cream ($6). We were both pleasantly full and happy after our meal.   They have a series of specialty drinks which the waiter pitched to us fervently with words like \"you can't get this anywhere else in the world..\" Ross tried \"Andy's Elixer\"and enjoyed it, but I was not impressed and thought it was a waste of $5 bucks.   We would visit again, but I imagine this isn't someplace that would elicit an: \"I have a craving for True Foods Kitchen\" statement. from my husband or I.",

    "text": "Definitely alot better than what I was expecting. This is one of the few places that I've eaten at, Phoenix or elsewhere, where the decor and set-up reflect the cuisine. For instance, you can see the food being prepared outside of the kitchen and it's all fresh (at least I think it is). It's fresh, it's honest, and it's got nothing to hide. They specialize in foods that are organic as well as several vegetarian friendly dishes (not too sure about vegan though). True Food Kitchen is about as healthy and tasty as food can get in the Valley. There are alot of negative stereotypes with health/vegetarian cuisine. In the back of the layman's mind, he thinks he's going to get horse food. I think that sometimes and I eat vegetarian on a regular basis. Well, be prepared for True Food to destroy those labels.  I ordered the garlic/mushroom/kale pizza and my friend got the chicken one. Both were delicious and tasted, oddly enough, very clean. I don't really know how else to describe it. Fresh equals a clean taste. Anyway, the food is to be experienced and it's well worth it. The portions aren't huge, but that's the point.  One thing I will so however is that you can tell that the people that are die-hards about this place are also from the area (PV/Biltmore). I kinda have a hard time telling if they actually enjoy the food or if they see it as being a very LA type of spot in Phoenix, thus sorta giving themselves points simply because it's trendy. What I'm trying to get to is that I really enjoyed my experience here I really do believe that there is something for everyone (vegetarian/carnivore) here. Just don't expect it to be Madonna's \"Like A Virgin\" in a culinary incarnation that the yuppies tell you. Go there with no expectations and you will have an awesome exprience.",

    "text": "I came here with my friend, P, for her birthday lunch. We were both excited to try it and had heard good. I had tried a couple of bites from them at corks and forks and nothing tasted great but cooking for a bunch of people at a festival like that can be difficult so I chalked that up to a fluke, skipped breakfast and came prepared wearing my eating pants.   We had to wait about 15 minutes to be seated then got a nice table towards the back where we could watch the beautiful Scottsdale/Arcadia moms lunch behind the glass. Why they were behind glass in their own separate room, I don't know.   What seemed to be the most promising part of the meal was the delicious juice concoctions on the menu THAT YOU CAN ADD VODKA TO!!! That's my dream. Why can't you do this everywhere? P ordered the Ginger Nojito and I got the New Dew. Our beautiful spiked drinks arrived in tall, pretty glasses and while P's was quite good, mine tasted like a tea made from old sweaty gym socks. I was pretty sure at this point it was just me because everything here is supposed to be really good so she tried it to and yup, gym socks. Once we got the waiter back we explained my drink's disgusting nature and while I wanted a little sympathy, he seemed to just think I didn't like it. Surely this wasn't the way it's meant to be served. It tasted nothing like honeydew, mint or limes. I went with what P had at that point because it was safe (I hate having to do that) and we decided to order.   We started with the Caramelized Onion Tart with Figs and Gorgonzola, added on the Edamame Dumplings at the recommendation of our waiter and rounded out our meal with Curry with Rice Noodle, Cauliflower, Cashews and Chicken. Everything came out pretty much at once but we started on the tart. It was near paper thin with the onions and figs a sweet contrast against the salty, skunky Gorgonzola. I could have eaten four of the them. Anybody who goes here, order this tart. It is so delicious, probably the best thing on the menu. The edamame dumplings proved to be bland, mush filled dough balls sitting in a pool of broth. They didn't taste particularly bad, just bland but that filling was so mushy inside. We couldn't get over the texture and textures don't normally bother me. Finally, our entree. It unfortunately was not much better than the dumplings. Cauliflower was described in the title but it only came with a few pieces. The sauce had a little bite but was still on the bland side at the same time. Does that make sense? It was spicy-ish, but without flavor. It tasted like a high quality TV dinner.   My husband went for a business lunch a couple weeks later and I told him to order the onion tart. He had pretty much the same experience. The tart was the best thing they ordered. We truly must be missing something because it seems that most people love this place. I won't be coming back unless it's a business dinner and I have no choice in the matter, but what could I say then.",

Also, the restaurant is very open so you know when the server blows you off. The food is pleasant, but I'll have to try something else on the menu to give an honest increase in stars.

HUGE kitchen, lots of people busily cooking, chopping, etc., bright and fresh colors.  I especially liked the butcher block table/industrial chair combo.  The kitchen extends into the dining area, so there a certain entertainment factor.  I have no idea what is going conceptually with the cuisine.  I get the whole \"healthy ingredients\" idea.  But, for goodness sake, pick a genre!  It's like a pizza joint meets Asian fusion diner meets Italian pasta joint meets new American cuisine (for lack of better description) meets juice bar.  There is nothing really tying the menu together, except quality ingredients, which just does not seem to work.  The server is far from stellar, and there were WAY too many servers per patron.  We never saw the same waiter/waitress twice.  Someone greets you, someone seats you, anther person takes your drink order, another brings the drinks, another takes your food order... you get my drift.  It took my dining partner and I asking three times to get our drinks - in fact, we finished our first course before we even got ice water.  Each time the waiter/waitress seemed put out by our request.  We shared a salad, soup and pizza - which evidently is a no-no at True Food.  Those who choose to share because they do not have a huge appetite and do not like leftovers are seriously looked down upon.    Apart from bad service, the food was not good.... at all.  The chicken minestrone soup and the sausage fennel pizza were very bland.  It was like they focused so much on the \"healthy\" aspect, that they forgot to flavor or season anything.  The pizza was tantamount to eating crispy cardboard.  I have a history of liking Fox restaurants, so this was, to say the least, was very disappointing.  I actually gave the restaurant the benefit-of-the-doubt due to it being a Fox restaurant and went back for another meal hoping it would redeem itself... yeah, it didn't.  I'd stay away from True Food.... there are a lot better options in the general vicinity that off MUCH better cuisine/service.",

It's such a great change from the usual food you'll find in a mall, because it's healthy, and it's a big change from most healthy restaurants, because it's super tasty.  We started with the Shitake Tofu Lettuce Cups, then the Thai Green Papaya Salad, and the Autumn Ingredient dish that was listed in the salads, but was all roasted veggies.  Our server was super helpful and friendly.  Service was quick, the outside patio was a pleasant place to eat.",

True Food Kitchen makes you believe that all other food might be - *gasp* - fake! this is seriously healthy food with flavor flare and creativity. not only that, but they truly exude the organic way of life with their considerate service and bouncy personalities to match.  Now don't go ordering something you wouldn't usually order just b/c you think it will be healthy. If you like fish, eat the fish, don't eat the steak tacos just b/c you think it'll be healthy - of course you will be less inclined to like it!   so far, i have had their soba noodles entree - it is a plentiful serving of cold green tea noodles tossed with peas, bok choy, and ginger. seriously good for you and excitingly tasty!  i have also had the tuna sliders, which come with no sides, so i suggest the sweet potato hash for something filling. the wasabi mayo, pickled onions, and avocado go deliciously well with the seared tuna patties.   last a-ha! tasteI had was trying the sustainable red wine from Arizona! Who woulda thunk that this glass would be so well-balanced -- and good for the earth too. Yay!  in a land where all i thought i could get was steak and deep fried tacos, True Food Kitchen is truly my home kitchen away from home!",

We started out with appetizers which were all good.  For the main course, I had the only meat dish on the menu, The beef tacos.  They were very good.  The beans that came with them were outstanding.  My biggest complaint about True is that they do not offer equal/sweet-n-low for your coffee or tee.  They have natural sweetener which is not sweet.  The service was ok, not great.

    "text": "Let me just begin by saying that I am a huge fan of Fox Restaurant Concepts.  I had heard so much about True Food Kitchen, so I decided to grab a quick bite to eat.  While previously on their website, I was drooling over their Ahi Tuna Sliders; as a result, I ordered them.  I must add that I believe that wasabi (a prominent flavor) BELONGS with anything ahi related.  These sliders came with a wasabi aioli, but it was very bland, and you could not even identify that wasabi was involved.  I asked if there was another wasabi sauce available that was stronger, but instead, the chef gave me a Sriracha aioli which was more mayonnaise (again) than anything else.  The server saw that I was still not enjoying the sandwich (it all lacked flavor, even the fish), so she had the chef make a stronger aioli.  It was ALMOST there.  It was not even hot, only a hit of wasabi.    I know that everyone has a different heat preference, but all I was asking was to TASTE the wasabi.  I needed lunch and needed to jet so I finished the meal with the last wasabi aioli attempt.  I was ready to pay, and to my surprise, the server comped my meal!  It was a pleasant surprise.  I was not impressed at all by my first experience with the food, but because of the nice gesture by the server, I will return again.    True Food Kitchen has a great atmosphere and a friendly and attentive staff.  Try it for yourself. :)",

    "text": "Hmmm... what to say about True Food Kitchen.  It seems to have take Coffee Plantation's spot at the Biltmore Shopping Center (Coffee Plantation sucked donkey) so Hooray!    TFK  looks fucking sweet from the outside with its floor to ceiling window/walls, but  it's a bit of a tangle on the inside.  While I can see what the owners/desingers where aiming at (wait maybe I can't I've never designed a restaurant...)  ,  I could not find a unifying theme for all of the decorative elements inside. Neon green tiles near the open kitchen , 70's wood pannel lamps in the dinning room, dark stone near the bathroom, and astro turf covering the hostess stand.  The place feels like a mix between fresh and easy and put-put golf.  The wait staff were dressed like car-hops working a veggy-brave-new-world drive thu..  I did like the wobbly butcher block tables.  Neat.    So who gives a crap about how a restaurant looks right?  I'm in it for the food.  I had the ahi tuna sliders (rare of course) with a side of sweet potatoe hash.  Sliders = derishious.  SPH = sadness :(  I loved the tuna, but god damn if the hash didn't come off as icky.   My date had the Teriyaki chicken with bown rice and veggies.  The chicken was overcooked and the bed of rice it came served over was saturated in Teryakie sauce that was rather tasty but became snail killing salty after 3 bites.  She also caught a snag of hot pepper on her first bite that made her scared the dish was spicy.  Keepy Spicey Separately.    Overall it was edible.  Have I had better?  Yup.  Do they have delish drink options, like natural ginger ale and organic honey lemonade? yesh!   But will all the neat stuff about this place and the fact that, like the Tuck Shop, they don't charge and arm and a leg, I still don't see myself ever comming back.  .",

The salmon more than made up for the roasted veggie entree... I'll go back for just the fish. Ditto for the shrimp dumpling app. Both simply made, but delicious.  Service was excellent, from the girl who opened the door with a huge smile, to the server who stopped by every five minutes to make sure everything was perfect. The server was amazing... She knew everything about everything on the menu. Management is obviously taking good care of the place, so I'll definitely be back.  Bonus points for the minimalist, trendy LA decor and American Apparel server outfits. It's cliched, but it works.   I actually felt like a better person for eating here.",

Some off beat varietals, like malbec and monastrell.  Our waiter, Andrew was amazingly knowledgeable about wine for his mere 26 years!  I ordered a veggie salad with beets, turnip, and some other crunchy root vegetables.  It was supposed to have manchego cheese but I realized half way through that it was missing!  The salad was tasty otherwise - perfect for a lite dinner on an extremely hot evening.  The patio seating was lovely and the misters were a life saver!",

The kitchen is open and so it can make for it being a little noisy. But nothing that is unbearable. You do get to see the staff handling the gorgeous fresh foods.  So a must have for me is the Cucumber Refresher drink. It is exactly what is states...refreshing. I tend to share a bit with my friends and both times they really like my drink. So much so the first time I gave my drink to my friend and I had her ginger drink that was OK. The first time I was there I ordered the Roasted Autumn Vegetables with Farro and Figs. It was alright nothing to write home about. The farro was great. Last week I had the Edamame Dumplings for an appetizer and the Miso Glazed Black Cod for an entree. These two dishes were right on.  I was scoping out the Cod on my first outing but did not get it. Go with your first instinct. The sauces on these dishes were amazing. They were light and flavorful. Both times my friends ordered the Teriayki Brown Rice/Veggie/Meat. Don't waste your time on this dish as you can get something very similar at Pei Wei or any other Asian place.   All in all I like True Food. They offer something different in a great location. They have good food and good service. I do have to say in the realm of restaurants that are going this route I would rather go to a smaller local place. It's just a choice I guess. But it is just something about the little places that is more exciting than a chain. I guess it is the feeling or intent in the preparation of the food.",

I loved the decor and the general idea of the place. The staff were nice...a bit too eager to have us like the place but they were nice.  Their juices were also good.  The bad: the vegan and vegetarian options were pretty bland. They used a lot of sauces to compensate for the lack of flavor in the food. I think part of the beauty of vegetarian, especially vegan plates is letting the natural food speak for itself. You can find better options around town. However, this place is nice for a group of vegans/vegetarians to go to as it offers more options on one menu rather than hitting up a regular restaurant and everyone has to order the same thing since it's the only available option on their menu.  Would I go again? Once in a blue moon and only if I'm on that side of town.",

    "text": "Beyond the attractive decor and nice food-presentation, I wasn't all that impressed by True Food. Certainly the concept of healthy, sustainable, locally bought food is great (albeit in the form of an upscale-chain), but overall, True Food didn't live up to the hype.  On the positive side, the edamame dumplings with daikon radish and white truffle oil were extremely tasty, and my Ginger Margarita was excellent.   On the not-so-positive side, the raw ahi tuna app-special was just OK, and the tiny slivers of fish (maybe 8 total?) were more of a \"taste\" than a full appetizer. Even worse, my chicken sausage pizza was slightly burnt on the bottom, and tasted bland and uninspired -- the sausage was finely ground and lacked much flavor, and the fennel was invisible. Added to the long wait (weekend dinner reservations are a must even though the restaurant is huge) and the pay-parking lot (if you stay more than two hours, which we did because of the long wait), we all came away mildly disappointed.  With many other excellent Phoenix-area restaurants to choose from, we'll head elsewhere next time.",

The food was fresh and in season, and the servers were knowledgeable and very friendly. The parking is very easy and we were seated almost immediately. It would have been nice to have a little more intimacy, since the seating outside and inside is a fairly wide open floor plan. Also, since we are from NYC, we are used to the prices. However, I believe high quality food is worth the money. We felt great a long time after eating, not heavy or sleepy.  I'd highly suggest eating here!",

    "text": "A friend of mine wanted to go for lunch this past weekend.  He suggested since it is the New Year and we are looking to eat on the healthier side, that we try this new restaurant called True Food Kitchen.    We arrived and at first glance I thought, this place is pretty cool.  It's located where the old Coffee Plantation used to be in the Biltmore Fashion Park.  It's over-sized dramatic lights and open \"Cafeteria style\" seating with a hip twist was interesting to me.   Bringing the kitchen to the middle of the dinning room was certainly a new concept.  They had food prep and pasta making in the middle of the room.  Not sure how well that goes over with the Health Department, but it certainly was innovative.    We were seated and immediately approached by our waitress who was very nice and helpful.  She took our drink order (oh no soda by the way) and returned to take orders. We both decided on salads. I went with the Harvest Chopped Salad, Butternut Squash, Apples, Walnuts, Goat Cheese & Balsamic Vinaigrette.   Meanwhile I saw the table next to us was served soup, and that sounded good, so I asked the waitress to add the Miso soup.   After all was delivered it was honestly very delicious!  The Goat Cheese was SO creamy and with the tangy vinaigrette and other added items in the salad it was such a good meal!    Now for the bad news...I guess it depends on the person but I thought for the portion sizes, It was a little pricey.  At first a $10 salad didn't seem like a big deal to me based on my experience on salads at other establishments, but honestly this was more like the size of a side salad.  I know the ingredients are \"Organic\" and \"Fresh\" but where do we draw lines?  Mind you, I am not complaining about the portion size, because I agree we as Americans over-eat, however the comparability to the price was off.  I don't think I am a cheap, but I just question why we pay more for food that is healthy?  This never really made sense to me.  Just some \"Food for thought\".",

We were pretty content after the entree but I just had to taste their desserts.  The almond oilve oil cake was so delish.  Light, fluffy.  A great summer dessert.

I've had the salmon before (fresh, thick, tender) and the kale salad (the kale is cooked but far from limp and comes sprinkled with what appears to be parmesan cheese and bread crumbs). Today, I also had the sweet potato hash (sweet potato and caramelized onions - yum!) and that plus the nojito are reason enough to go.  My friend had a chicken salad and a medicine man drink.  He wasn't wowed by the salad which consisted of your basic salad with chicken but he said he'd try the place again.   The place is pricey though.  The sandwich was around $15, and the nojito might have run $5?   Went at 12:30 on a weekday and the place was packed.  We had to wait about 15 minutes.  It's easier to get in right away at dinner.",

Jared, our server, made excellent recommendations and treated us so kindly and always with a smile. We had a problem with our soup and the manager came out, apologized sincerely, and another lady came out to apologize when our meal was taking a little longer to come out. The food was fantastic, and the chocolate cake dessert was mind blowing! Thank you so much, True Food. We loved the welcome and the food so much that we came back the next day to the same level of service from Mackenzie. I feel like the manager, Mark, really sets the awesome tone for this restaurant, as he touched our table with every visit and was out on the floor helping his staff every time we were there. He even read me my Facebook notifications off the phone I left there (like an idiot) when I called to check if they had it, haha! I cannot wait until they're in Bellevue, WA!  My favorite nibbles from True Food Kitchen during my week there were: The Mediterranean Quinoa Salad (refreshing!), the Tataki (drool), the Hangover Rx drink (only if you like coconut water, though!), the Seabass (drool), the spicy shrimp (drool), the matcha horchata (mega-drool), and the flourless chocolate cake (save. room. for. this.). As a Seattle-ite, I've got to give them props--their seafood is spot on!  Thanks guys. You'll see me again soon :)",

It was crunchy, flavorful and very filling. that didn't stop me from having a pizza. I mean, I have to even out that healthy kale salad AND the pizza was organic and full of veggies, so it's okay.    If you have any dietary restrictions or have several friends who are on fad diets (you know the ones. Those who suddenly are 'gluten free' for no apparent reason).. take them here. You can still enjoy a delicious meal without having to be a pain in the butt!",

My favorite of the four salads were the Tuscan kale salad and the the chicken salad.  Teriyaki quinoa bowl was tasty and flavorful. I really liked the the margarita pizza was very light and thin.  They lost a star for the customer service. I wish the waitress would've been more friendly and engaging, but it was obvious she just wanted to go home.  If I go back I would definitely get the chicken salad again along with the margarita pizza.  For dessert, the flan was definitely the best. Followed by the awesome flourless chocolate cake and the fresh key lime pie.",

For an appetizer we shared the kale guacamole and I think it's safe to say this is the one of the best guacs I've ever tasted! For a main, I ordered the T.L.T sandwich and for desert, my dad and I shared a slice of the vegan key lime pie! I've never had key lime pie before so this was pretty awesome to see that the one on the menu was vegan! Definitely recommend if you're vegan/vegetarian and want to find a place that's great to dine at with an omni or simply want to enjoy some great food!",

Our party of 5 was seated at a king sized wooden tables, of which there are many. I remark on this because I'm from two cities where they cram us all in so that we're intimate with strangers. I realize I might not mind this too much. We pretty much had to shout across the table to each other, the tables are so large! I'd be more bugged by that if I wasn't so in love with the concept and food. Regardless, it's good to know that large groups can be accommodated (10 probably could have fit at our table!)  Our shared apps:  -crudite with dips (loved the black olive!)  I really *really* wish huge bowls of fresh, crunchy veggies would become an American restaurant trend, ruling over the damn bacon or *insert your unhealthy comfort food* trends that I'm positive only exist  thanks to a backfire that BS fat-free 90s food trend. Anyway, I fully accept such a trend probably won't happen anytime soon.   -herbed hummus (divine! It has a unique taste and excellent texture).  I ordered and did *not* share because it was so good I conveniently forgot:  -the mouthwatering Tuscan Kale salad (one of the best I've ever had in a restaurant)  -TLT with avocado (piles of freshness: lettuce, beautiful tomato, lush avocado and crispy tempeh SO plentiful, I should have stopped at one half but I couldn't stop!!)  Dessert? Oh, I would have tried, believe me, if half as good as all that preceded it, no doubt would have been incredible. But I was immobile by meal's end.  True Food is the healthiest franchise I've ever had the fortune of experiencing! Here's to hoping they branch out to New Orleans.",

I saw a turkey burger on the menu and was sold - I love turkey burgers with all of my heart and had high hopes that the True Food one would be amazing. In fact, it was pretty \"meh\" - dry and definitely overcooked which gave me a sad. I do love that they happily let you split your side choice so I got 1/2 sweet potato hash (also \"ok\") and 1/2 kale salad (absolutely amazing).   I wish there were more options for unsweetened drinks - most of the tasty items included honey lemonade or sweetened tea. That said, a plain house iced tea was good & freshly brewed. Service was great - friendly, prompt and enthusiastic.

I can confidently say that True Food is the ONLY restaurant that I can fully depend on to make my food right every time. Not only is it geared perfectly to my allergies but it is absolutely delicious. The chefs definitely know what they're doing in the kitchen. Secondly, the service in all areas of True Food at the Biltmore are excellent. The greeters and the hosts at the door are always so welcoming. It's refreshing to walk into an establishment with such smiling faces. Additionally, Ari (the manager) greets us every time we are in there like we are family. She is always smiling and out on the floor helping every one out...seems like a really great manager. However, what we truly look forward to most is coming to visit ANDREW. With his quick wit, kind heart and superb service, it is always a treat. Andrew was our first server here, and from then on we were hooked! He was so accommodating and knowledgeable about the menu and the concept that True Food Kitchen prides itself on, we instantly felt at home.

Whatever, I still drank it since it arrived while I was in the restroom and couldn't immediately send it back and I was thirsty. We shared a hummus appetizer which was really good and obviously very fresh.  Even better when the onions, feta, olives were included in my scoop. Next up was what sounded very delicious, the soup du jour: saffron potato.  I added quite a bit of pepper to it so it had some flavor.  It wasn't bad by any means.  I ate two spoonfuls that had saffron in them and those were tasty bites.  I really wished there would have been more saffron in my cup of saffron soup. I ordered the chicken sausage pizza.  The marinara sauce was sweet and I don't like sweet marinara.  I gave half my pizza to other diners to try.  It needed something like onions or peppers to compliment the taste of the sweet marinara and mild chicken sausage. One of the other diners ordered the chicken with asparagus which was very moist and tender, mainly because it was cooked and served with the skin on.   Overall, it was ok.  I'm not going to request to go here ever.  If someone is having a dinner or lunch here, I'd probably meet up with them later.   I think this place is fantastic for people that eat healthy or have sensitive stomachs.  It's not really the ideal restaurant for people who think of dining out as a possible adventure.",

Have been here a lot of times and will not get tired of coming back! =)  Refreshing and organic food, lovely ambiance...=) We fell in love with this place after our very first trip in their location in Biltmore. There was quite a wait but it was well worth it. If you are looking for a new refreshing taste with choices for vegan and gluten allergic people, this is the place to be! The concept does not stay away from making their food delicious while using the freshest and most organic ingredients. I love bragging this place both to our local and out-of-towner friends. I've tried a variety of what they have to offer in the menu but my favorites are the Tuscan Kale and Chicken Chopped Salad, all types of pizza esp the one with goat cheese and the spaghetti squash casserole which is very light and healthy! For dessert, the flourless chocolate cake is just amazing! =) Service is fast and efficient. Pricing is fair plus they offer half order to some of the selection in the menu.   Great place for lunch and dinner! Will have to try their breakfast menu soon! =)",

I would not complain if I ate one of those every day! The muffin was so delicious, what a combination of flavors! The only down side for me is that it was quite pricey. Don't get me wrong, the food was mouth-watering, but I wouldn't want to spend that much money on a regular basis.",

With only a small amount of these really thin soba noodles, it was like chewing through hunks of wood, and too much cilantro, every so often you'd just chomp down on an entire sprig of it it seemed. Still tasted pretty good though, just needs some refining.   The juice drink I had was really interesting and I liked it quite a bit. It was agave and Ginger, which gave it a nice bite but was still very refreshing and light feeling.  Overall it was not a bad experience, the atmosphere was nice (with the right company) and the wait-staff seemed helpful.  But for the price I would expect a little more concentration on their cooking not just the ingredients...",

The kale salad is great as well. Had tempeh here for the first time and it's good too. I feel like you can't go wrong with their menu. The porter beer was incredible and their refreshing drinks are awesome. My favorite are the Ginger and the pineapple with coconut water ones. The teriyaki bowl with tofu is a hit and so if the curry bowl. It can be packed midday for lunch but not as much in the evening. The kitchen is open and they make a lot of their food steps away from you. I love this place! I can't wait to return to Phx to have it again.",

All I have to say is -- WOW!  The food is so unique and interesting at  TFK. All of the menu items are organic or locally grown (or at least locally sourced) and the menu was created with Dr. Andrew Weil. But this is not your father's hippie health food.  We shared a shrimp dumpling dish as an appetizer, which was delicious. For dinner my wife had a curry noodle with shrimp dish that was light and just a tad tangy from the curry. I'm usually not a curry person but this was just enough curry to add flavor without being overpowering.  I had a pizza with shrimp, caramelized onions, sweet red peppers and goat cheese. It was amazing...one of the best pizza dishes I've ever had. I'm a huge California Pizza Kitchen fan and I'd put this up against any of my favorites at CPK.  For dessert we shared an apple-cranberry crumble with non-dairy maple ice cream in top. It was sort of like a sweet granola with huge chunks of baked apples, soft cranberries and this amazing ice cream that was so good it was hard to believe it wasn't actually ice cream. Delicious.  We're definitely going back to True Food Kitchen!",

I was just there last week celebrating a career change with my mother and we got there at a high volume time. A table opened up quickly, but there is one thing I will never understand and that is why the bus boys or waiters, DON'T clean the WHOLE table. I watched the guy do a quick rub down and there were still lettuce pieces on the table... Why? In my mind I was thinking, \"Please wipe up the lettuce! The lettuce!\"  Sadly, no.  Also, his rag was so wet that I didn't want to put anything down so we asked our hostess for a second wipe down. The same guy walked back over to redo the table and said, \" You need another wipe down, huh?\" As if it was strange.  Oh well! But the mushroom pizza was amazing and my kale salad was exactly what I needed.  Love the place but don't like rag wet tables!",

But I wasn't in the mood for a spa experience.  So the martini came without olives. As did the kale and mushroom pizza on whole wheat crust.   But both tasted great. Even my kid thought enough of the kale pizza to eat half of it. He's four, and roasted kale is usually a hard sell.   Anyway, quick service, pleasant surroundings. Family-friendly enough to make me feel comfortable with my kid (despite the occasional stares of couples who probably have <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FChildfree.org&s=34a5314e83a55959049a35c1127838b31e3ba1660232f06cb74835aef676a588\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Childfree.org</a> stickers on their BMW's, where the man is tallying stock options and the woman is trying to silence the wails of her empty and yearning womb. Of course I'm used to that.)  Anyway, I liked the place. I'll be back. I don't think I like it as much as I liked Coffee Plantation when it was in the same spot 15 years ago.

My only complaint would be that it was a little overdone - I asked for it medium-rare and it was definitely medium-well (overcooked burgers are a pet peeve of mine). The kale salad was tasty as well. I'll definitely be back!",

The restaurant is very popular and looks like a very hip place to be after work. I was here for lunch on a Saturday and it was full, made a reservation for my friends and I and were seated within 10 minutes. The noise level is in the high range here.  Food is fabulous. Prices a bit on the high side but worth it. Located in an upscale shopping center within a business district. Validated 2 hour parking in the nearby lot at this writing.",

    "text": "I have been waiting a long time to try True Food Kitchen. I tried Lyfe Kitchen a year ago in Denver and felt a bit under whelmed with the experience.   This expirence was much of the same. Don't get me wrong. The place is beautiful with big windows, plants and fresh food all around. I loved the open kitchen and watching the food prep go on right next to us.   The waitstaff was very, very friendly. But very, very slow. We were really hungry after hiking and really needed food and drinks to replenish. We did a lot of waiting which made us a bit hangry. It also seemed more like a fast casual place than a full service type ambiance so we really just wanted to eat and run, which is what most people around us were doing. We also noticed how people who arrived after us received their food before us which was irritating.   We tried their juices which were fresh and tasty. They also had a nice presentation. But again, took 15 minutes to come out. Then we had the soup of the day which was a Thai Curry chicken soup. It was amazing. It was spicy and the flavor was spot on. We then had a fall vegetable salad that I felt was very tasty for what it was. My husband didn't agree and he wasn't too happy with it. I'd definitely give it another try since I love whole, fresh foods. I'd come here if there were one close to me  and try other stuff since it seems like all the options may not be consistent. I love that there are chefs out there creating unique and flavorful plant based dishes. Hopefully this trend will continue to spread!",

I've come here for breakfast in smaller and larger groups (2-6) and the service is always on point.  The market scramble is lovely (not heavy with oil like a lot of breakfasts, yet quite filling), as are the Quinoa Johnny Cakes (they just taste like fluffy, delicious pancakes - get the yogurt on the side to make sure you like it as a topping).  The also have wonderful lunch/dinner options! A few favorites include the shitake tofu lettuce wraps (wow! flavor) and the new seared spicy tuna wrap (my friend tasted it and said, \"Woah!  I didn't know tuna could be this good!\"), the red chili shrimp and the spaghetti squash casserole (this one is a little smaller, so get an appetizer if you're hungry).  The regular drinks, like the Cucumber Refresher, are absolutely delicious, but the Juby True juices are quite hit-or-miss, according to a few juice-loving friends.",

This healthy eating is definitely NOT me. OMG!!!  ABSOLUTELY AWESOME!!!! My initial thought was type of eating would not satisfy my idea of a 'good' breakfast so my backup plan was to drive across the street to Over Easy; how WRONG was I!  I started w/t watermelon lemonade added the Smashed Avocado Toast w/my egg over medium PLUS an order of the fennel chicken sausage (after one bite of the fennel chicken sausage, I have decided to give up pork sausage and bacon).  E-V-E-R-Y-T-H-I-N-G was SUPER delicious!   In between bites of my Smoked Avocado Toast (they use Dave's Killer Seeded Bread) and sips of the fragrant watermelon lemonade, I had questions upon questions for my server Chandler. The Manager, Desiree 'Dez' stopped by to check on me at which time I asked the question 'when are you coming to Chicago?'  Dez, smiled and said Oh, we are already in Chicago.'  Duh, so embarrassing.  Dez, suggested I save room for dessert.  THEY HAVE DESSERT!!  And boy do they have desserts, the flourless chocolate cake w/ ice cream - simply fabulous, and the ice cream is NOT made from SOY! I have to end this BUT I co-workers and I will be spending some time at TRUE's Chicago location.",

Then the waiter Adam who after taking the order is missing through out the dinner only to pop up at the end with the check. Never came back to ask if we needed change or a thank you or a goodbye even though he was standing 3 feet from us.   What a disappointment. This place has really gone down hill.  We use to frequent it often but haven't been in almost a year. We were overdue for a visit.  Won't find any of the regular folks who use to work there. It seems like a Temp Agency has taken over staffing and its just a bunch of temps running it. Just a real disappointment. Plus the food simply isn't up to par anymore. And what's with the \"spring menu\"??... it's almost August!    Treated our friends to a birthday dinner and now wish we had gone elsewhere. We feel awful.

On the other hand some of our dishes were not better than three-stars-worthy: brussels sprouts app was overcooked and the kale guacamole was a small, low, half-mixed pile of large avo chunks and kale shreds with some ingredients we couldn't identify, accompanied by a disproportionately large pile of unappealing pita chips. The spaghetti squash casserole was like something you'd make at home when you don't know what else to make, only it was half as much as you'd eat at home. The inside out quinoa burger fell apart immediately, turned into a mess on the plate, and was just eaten with a fork.  The server was precious, not in a good way, and no matter what exchange she had with the table, she'd end the interaction by putting her hand down dramatically on the table and saying \"Mmmkay, let me know if there's anything else I can bring for the table.\" The first time or two it was mildly weird but she did the same thing four or five times, robotically, no matter what stage of the meal we were at, and it just left the whole interaction feeling programmed and impersonal.",

We had squash pie with coconut cream whipped cream and dark graham cracker crust and flourless chocolate cake with vanilla ice cream.   Go, go now! Not inexpensive, but worth every bit of it.

I needed to call and adjust the party size and the restaurant was very accommodating.   Per their open table notes, I requested a table inside. We ended up in a small private room, I imagine is perfect for business conferences or more \"intimate\" parties. Our server was fantastic though I don't recall her name - petite, light brown gal with short curly hair and maybe some freckles? Wish I could mention her name so she could get the credit she deserves!!  She was attentive despite probably having a full section in addition to the side room. She was very knowledgeable about the menu and knew options for different dietary restrictions. My mom was able to enjoy herself on a Keto diet here. They offer plenty vegan, vegetarian, and gluten free dishes. I highly recommend giving them a try. Even if you think vegan food is weird, you're bound to enjoy the vegan pesto pizza, teriyaki bowl, or another perfectly prepared vegan dish. Delicious flavors, fresh ingredients. Their drinks are also prepared with fresh juices. Nice ambience. We were taken care of well for our occasion! Would definitely come back.",

    "text": "I really like the spaghetti casserole made out of squash. They basically cut the squash with something like a vegetti, and then make the veggi-pasta into a casserole with tomato sauce topped with cheese. Delicious and super simple.  I've had it in the restaurant, which was a fantastic experience. The drinks were also great.    However, I'm deleting a star, because when I ordered it at work delivered, it was small, cold, and very lonely looking in the big take out container. We pay the same price to get it to go, without making dirty plates, without taking up real estate. I think Take-out should be at least as good as in the restaurant, if not better. Oh well. It's still healthier than 90% of the crappy pre-prepared, processed sysco food at all the other restaurants.",

    "text": "If you are on a diet, looking for healthy food, or just want some great food True Food Kitchen is the spot.  Everything there is scratch made and fresh.  The restaurant its self is very modern and open which I love.  Their menu constantly changes which is good because that means there menu is changing with the seasons of the food so the food is fresh.  When I go there I always start of with a Kale Aid drink.  The Kale Aid is kale, ginger, apple, celery, cucumber, lemon, tastes very refreshing.  Then the must go to is Ancient Grains Bowl with Chicken.  The bowl consists of miso glazed sweet potato, turmeric, charred onion, snow pea, grilled portobello, avocado, hemp seed.  This bowl is packed with flavor and it doesnt look much but it will fill you up (That is the hemp seed).  With the Anchient Grains Bowl I recommend getting the Charred Cauliflower which consists of harissa tahini, medjool date, dill, mint, pistachio.  It really is a great pairing to the Ancient Grains Bowl.  This place has it all for everyone unless you are just looking for a dirty cheat meal then this is not the place  but still a great place to have a healthy hearty meal.  The restaurant is very pricey though so watch out the bill will shot up quick.  The food is always fresh and made from scratch so that is why it is expensive.  Good clean food is always pricey.  So, all in all this is not a False Kitchen everything you hear about this place is TRUE!  BrandonFitFoodie",

My Chopped Salad with grilled chicken was so delicious and filling I'm already wanting to order it again.  We all had a wonderful time!

The almond ricotta was really yummy and a great cheese substitution. The server was really friendly, kept checking in on us and gave me vegan suggestions she liked when I asked. I food came out pretty quickly. The pizza was messy to eat because nothing is really holding the toppings to the crust. So the tomatoes kept sliding off. The almond ricotta comes in mounds so you need to spread it out a bit (unless you like it really concentrated). The pizza dough and olive oil/herb blend they used were fantastic. Great flavor. I've been putting off coming here because wasn't sure about the vegan options I saw on the menu but really glad I tried it.",

I usually go to the Scottsdale Quarter location, which is far busier, but the Biltmore location is a nice slower-paced restaurant with a relaxing vibe.   I always get the veggie crudites. The tzatziki and olive dips are just amazing and it is a perfect light appetizer that supplements a healthy meal. I usually opt for the grilled chicken salad but decided to go for the Tuscan kale salad and added protein. I was quite happy with my choice and enjoyed my lunch very much (and felt good after).  I have been with friends/family who have not been happy with their orders but the wait staff has always been kind enough to work through a solution. I personally have never had a bad experience with my order here. I love True Food for lunch and am glad to have the option of the Biltmore location for a more relaxed vibe.",

Also important to know, if you are very hungry, i would recommend ordering a few things.  That being said, the food tastes amazing and you will feel good eating it.   First trip: Ancient grains bowl with chicken. Not too filling but hit the spot and i could taste everything so well. Get it  Second trip: inside out Quinoa burger. Again very tasty but didn't fill me up. Should have ordered something else.   Overall: Definitely try his place! Only criticism, could get pricey to be full and satisfied.   Savor the flavors!",

    "text": "True Food Kitchen is one of my favorite restaurants, as seen by my past review. It isn't close to our house, and for us, it is considered a treat because we don't eat out much. So I am disappointed to leave this updated review, and even more disappointed about our recent experience. On Thursday we went to this location and were excited to find out that they have a \"Paleo\" menu now. I was finally able to try the spaghetti squash casserole with the modifications. It was absolutely phenomenal and my husband agreed!  But the watermelon and heirloom tomato appetizer was not good at all, super bland, and for the price, extremely disappointing. I am not one to complain though, so I just let it go. On Saturday it was my birthday and I wasn't feeling that great and my husband offered to drive and get me True Food Kitchen (like I said we are not close). Since we were celebrating and I knew it would be a long time until I ate here again, I decided to try something else in addition to the spaghetti squash casserole. So we both got the Good Earth Cobb Salad and added chicken (and had the salad with Paleo modifications). Well the salads were ok, but the chicken that was added on was a couple slices of chicken breast. Unfortunately, the prices were not listed on the paleo menu and now I know that those salads cost $18 each. I am extremely disappointed that we were charged so much for a salad that was so minuscule and lackluster. I am the first person to understand that quality food costs more, but this is just greed and I am very disappointed. True Food, you can do better!",

Their pizza is yummy too!  Restaurant week came by not too long ago and I felt like going here twice because the first time was that good!   So on a weekday and the weekend, I basically ate the same thing.   First course:  Shitaki lettuce cups (tofu, jicama, Thai basil, cashew, sambal) & hummus - both very flavorful, tofu mix tasted hearty for a vegan appetizer  Wild caught albacore tataki w/avocado, jalapeno, yuzu ponzu - this was presented and tasted sharp and salty in a good way  Second course:  Scottish Steelhead Salmon w/smoked onion farro, arugula, corn, roasted beets, pumpkin seeds - I loved this entree! Salmon was cooked medium ish medium rare with a soft pink flesh center. The combo is genius! Flavor, colors and textures were perfect!   Dessert:  flourless chocolate cake w/vanilla ice cream, caramel, cocoa nibs - decadent chocolate but balances well with the vanilla and the nibs give it a solid crunch The chia seed pudding came with bananas and toasted coconut - a nice and light dessert if you don't want something heavy  I also got the refreshing seasonal watermelon drink!   Battle of weekday vs weekend:  Weekday: I enjoyed the albacore tataki this day maybe because it had more avocado, heartier and bigger bowl of shitaki tofu app, great service  Weekend: the shitaki lettuce cups just tasted a bit more overcooked and didn't seem as big in portion as the weekday.  Refill was available on the watermelon refresher as it was not on the weekday. The forever nightmare - friend had the grass-fed steak tacos. Good stuff right? Until she got to the middle of the second taco. A dark think piece of short hair. Hard not to gag, but so sad the rest of that taco went to waste. So sad. And sad I have to envision that hair because I love tacos!  Winner = Starboy weekday  Loser = weekend weak end",

Once again I'm cool I understand mistakes happen so I told them and when the pizza came back they added the mozzarella and I couldn't believe the brought out this pizza it was so burnt I wish I had pictures. So I told them and 15 minutes later my new pizza how I ordered it arrived. Did a manager come by and apologize? Nope! Did they offer to bring me something while I waited for my food and everyone was eating? Nope! Did they do the right thing and take it off the check? Nope! $80 tab couldn't eat dinner with my family should have probably made things right. I won't be back anytime soon. Plus we boxed up my sons pizza and they accidentally threw the box away so they made him a new pizza. Why did it have the gluten free crust I have zero idea. Just completely dropped the ball tonight.

I ordered the Sparkling Antioxidant Tea { organic iced green tea | pomegranate | lemon} and it was just as refreshing as it sounds! For lunch I ordered the Ancient Grains bowl (vegan). It comprised of miso glazed sweet potato, turmeric, charred onion, snow pea, grilled portobello, avocado, red quinoa, and hemp seed. The miso glaze on the sweet potatoes was to die for!

    "text": "As of this review (September 2017), there are currently a whopping 23 True Food locations across eleven states - which often has me surprised that the millennial crowd isn't more quick to dismiss TFK as an evil chain. But at the same time, it almost seems to be tailored made for Yelp, as users generally seem to rave about places that cater towards the vegan/vegetarian/anti-gluten crowd. And believe me, True Food is definitely one of those places that seems to be targeting all of the people that simultaneously developed food allergies around 2009. Not that there's anything wrong with that, of course.  TFK has been on our bookmark list for years. We've passed by this particular Biltmore location many times, but have always put off going there for various reasons. For one, it looks like the kind of place I'd eat at if I just had a coronary bypass and forced to drastically modify my diet. Additionally, as I've mentioned in practically every Fox concept restaurant I've ever tried - I just can't bring myself to look past the whole hip-corporate vibe that just feels so damned sterile and uninspiring.  But when the mood is right and if I choose my menu items very carefully, Fox Concepts can actually deliver a decent meal. And this is one of those instances where I'm willing to openly admit that the food here is actually respectable.  Although the menu isn't really my style, there are thankfully some options for people like myself who still eat meat and don't count calories. The menu appears to be seasonal for summer (even though it's now Fall). I'm guessing they have several main staples that are permanent, while rotating out other items that are only available at certain times of the year.  I ordered myself a honey lemonade and my girlfriend and I split some of their kale guacamole. The lemonade was a bit weaker than I like - although I didn't really expect to find the diabetic coma-level lemonade that can be obtained at a place like Matt's Big Breakfast. The guac was just okay, but a bit too new-age for my taste buds. Neither one of us were impressed with the chips.  For my main entree, I ordered the grass-fed burger which had a nice flax seed bun. Meat was good quality and my girlfriend and I both agreed that it was actually superior to the burgers served at the nearby Fox-owned Zinburger, which is kind of funny. Mine came with kale salad and some sweet potato hash. The hash was dry and bland, while the kale was fine, but not really my style.  My girlfriend ordered the steak tacos, which naturally, also get the grass-fed buzzword status. Joking aside, the tacos were also good quality, having great-tasting meat and including some avocado, greek yogurt, and cilantro. They're full-size tacos (two) and come with a small bowl of decent beans.  For dessert, I found most of their choices a bit lame, but given the way the menu is developed, I kind of expected this. We opted for the chia seed pudding, which included coconut and banana. Neither one of us had had tried chia seed pudding before, so I'll at least give them some credit for exposing us to something different. It's an overall light dessert that still tasted satisfying on the level of a smoothie.  The question is: Would we ever come back?  Honestly, some day, we probably will. Although I maintain that this food isn't really something I'd regularly crave, I can easily see why it's very popular with all the urban locals. Out of all of the Fox Concepts restaurants we've tried, this is easily one of the better ones out there.  I'd definitely recommend it, but it appears that we're basically the last people in Phoenix to actually try it.",

Great Upscale Fast-Casual Restaurant in AZ True Foods is in an upscale mall/area in Phoenix. I came here during lunch on a Friday and they were very busy, so prepare for a wait during lunch time. The place was decorated well and the employees were very nice. I ordered the curried cauliflower soup and the hummus platter. It was very good, especially the soup. The food is definitely good and that explains their prices as well; those two items cost $20 together.",

    "text": "while i cannot deny that True food kitchen offers quality food with fresh and healthy ingredients (with calorie information printed neatly on the menu), i think the food lacks a little UMPH and depth of flavor. the restaurant itself is brightly lit, neatly organized, and very clean; service is quick and not overbearing with a casual vibe; the layout is beautiful - HUGE open kitchen, bar seating, and plenty of tables (including a semi private area in the back). I've been here on two occasions - once for solo dinner (had the spicy panang curry with chicken) and once for a team lunch (seasonal salad with chicken). the food arrives quickly so it was perfect for both occasions.  i think the price tag to food yumminess ration leaves room for improvement..",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I am a big fan of True Food Kitchen.  I've been a frequent customer at both locations.  I love the food, the philosophy, the ambience and usually the service.  I've never written a review, but after my most recent experience I wanted to share some observations.  The last 2 visits our charred cauliflower has been comped because it's taken so long to come out of the kitchen (20-25 minutes) it came after our entrees.  There is inconsistency in how the charred cauliflower dish comes out (some have more/less nuts/dates, more/less harissa sauce, more/less dill), which I don't really mind because its all delicious. But they may want to work on consistency of preparation of this dish.  Our most recent visit was 1/11/2019 (a slow Monday) and we were sitting at the bar, so I'm not really sure why it took so long to notice our app was going on 25 minutes and still not ready?  We also ordered the ramen and a salad and that took even longer to come out.  On a Monday.    This is my observation for the TFK managers to pay attention to:  We sat at the bar and watched the steady stream of take-out pick ups, and shared space at the bar with Uber eats and Door Dash drivers who were in and out non-stop. There were several staff dedicated to prepping all the to-go bags. I get it that this is a new and profitable segment of your business, but please don't privilege the take-out and delivery drivers at the expense of your live, in person guests sitting at your bar wanting both your food and the experience of being out.  We are important paying guests too.  And our bill includes alcohol, which is where you and your servers make the most money, so keep an eye on the speed of processing our orders as well.  Thank you!!",

The service is very fast and the wait staff is friendly. We were pondering a bottle of Cannonau from Italy that the waitress was not very familiar with, she asked the bartender about the flavor profile and reported back to us. We ended up sending the bottle back because the wine was really terrible and might have turned. We got a new bottle of Pinot noir from Oregon which was way better. This restaurant really stands out when it comes to food being prepared in an unfussy manner and flavor profiles that pack a punch. My favorite dish here is the edamame dumplings with dashi and truffle oil.  I literally need a moment to compose myself after biting in to a dumpling because it's that good. The edamame filling is texturally pleasing and hearty, it's creamy and has a edamame taste that is not too overpowering. The dashi and truffle oils compliments the earthy edamame flavor enough to curl your toes. I have ordered this dish many of times and it is always pleasing to the palate. The other dishes are also very good. I ordered the striped bass as my main course, the grill lines on that perfectly crisp skin was divine. The savory and hint of sweet flavor was well balanced and worked very well in the that dish.",

Our server was knowledgeable about the menu and provided us with helpful suggestions and options regarding drinks and entrees. She also provided me with background information about the restaurant. The bar was also able to make a great Moscow Mule, a beverage not regularly on the menu. My friend got the fish tacos and I got the grilled chicken salad. We also got he kale guacamole which was not bad at all. The kale wasn't overpowering which I liked. It's a good place to go to if you are looking for a clean eating option. The flourless chocolate cake was delicious too. Very rich.",

Boyfriend had the inside out quinoa burger with half and half kale salad and sweet potato hash which was delicious. I had the turkey burger with half kale salad and sweet potato hash.   The meal was delicious, by far the best kale salad I have ever had. But my sweet potatoes were a tad undercooked. I also ordered the citrus skinny margarita which was awesome, fruity with the right amount of Anejo tequila.  At the end we ordered the flourless chocolate cake and the gluten free key lime pie. We absolutely loved the flourless chocolate cake. It came with vanilla ice cream, caramel and cocoa nibs which added a nice bit of crunch and a balance of flavors. but I still missed my graham cracker crust. Overall, it was a really good meal. Service was super friendly & attentive. Would definitely return.",

I'm new to eating healthy and cooking healthy. I'd love to get the recipe for this meal...are you listening True Foods?   I like scrumptious or spicy food over bland. The lemon whatever they tossed the arugula in was unexpectedly yummy and addicting. The trout was moist, delicious and pretty! :-) The tabbouleh was plentiful and made me full by the time I finished scooping up every morsel. I'm now officially glad there's a True Foods closer by at the Biltmore.   The first time I went to a True Foods, I had a salad that looked like they just arranged all the prettiest raw veggies from the farmer's market they could find and crammed them into a bowl. It looked like art but it also felt like I was just eating from the produce section. It was boring. It had no taste. But I care more about healthy eating now than I did that first visit.   If other items on their menu are this tasty, True Foods and I are going to become close.   I recommend restaurants to my high end matchmaking clients all the time. I like that you can go for a walk after dinner and hold hands window shopping or go for an after dinner drink at one of the many nice places at both TF locales...

    "text": "I wrote a review about True Foods a couple of months ago and it wasn't in their favor. I received a very nice email from them advising that my review was appreciated and while I didn't have a great experience, they would certainly like me to give their establishment another shot. After all, they pride their restaurant in great customer service and excellent food quality and they want their guest to return. I was provided a gift card to try it again and today was the day for me to see if my last experience was a fluke or if my experience was not uncommon.  Since I was by myself, I sat at the bar and was greeted by a friendly smile and immediate service. Already a better experience. I ordered the same thing as last time, grass-fed beef with no mayo nor bun and a kale salad without breadcrumbs. My food swiftly came out, but when I bit into the medium burger their was an abundance of char. Since I know that some restaurants like to char their burgers I asked the bartender if this was the way the burger was supposed to be cooked. It was cooked medium, as I asked, it was just charred on the outside. He immediately took my plate, apologized and advised he would get me a new dish. That was not my intention, but the proactivity and eagerness to please his customer was apparent. Within a short time a manager, named Desiree, approached me with my new order and graciously thanked me for my patience and apologized for how my previous burger came out. When I placed my cards on the table to pay the tab, I was brought a check without an amount due. Desiree again approached me thanking me for coming in.  I can tell you that my experience today was one that I will always remember, in a positive way. It's not about them taking care of the tab, it's 100% about the fact that my bartender took ownership without me asking for my burger being sent back, the manager apologizing for the mistake, my second meal tasting absolutely amazing, and having an optimal customer experience. I will be back and hope that others will read this review and give True Foods a try.  Well done, True Foods! Thank you for an amazing customer experience and a delicious lunch!",

I really enjoyed brunch way more than the dinner menu, but I will need to re-visit to update my decision.    This place is a little more pricey but they stress the idea of a seasonal menu that nourishes your mind, body and spirit. Can't ask for more if it is all fresh food, they truly know how to be innovative with all healthy ingredients.  Also, try one of the fresh drinks, they are all super delicious.  Both drinks that my friend and I ordered, we both loved.  I had the Hangover RX (although I didn't need a hangover remedy).  True Food is in a great location in the Biltmore Fashion Park.  Indoor seating is nice, a little overcrowded, but outdoor patio is a great - of course in a cooler climate.  But it is relaxing if you get the chance, the misters are out.  Check this place out.",

The staff was overall friendly, they also gave off a snooty vibe. I probably didn't help my case by walking in sweaty from a mile long walk in the midday summer heat while wearing workout clothes and worn out Birkenstocks. But hey, a girl's gotta eat!    Also, they did have a few vegan dessert options as well, but they all looked like shit. Add a vegan brownie or cake on there. No one wants flan or plain vanilla ice cream.",

Came to this delicious restaurant while visiting a girlfriend in the Phoenix area. I wish I hadn't; only because it's all I think about! Started with a Bloody Mary--best one I've had. You can taste the fresh-ness, like they literally made the tomato juice there themselves.  We ordered the edamame dumplings as an appetizer. So fresh and light. A great starter to a meal, as it was not too large/heavy.. We ordered three meals to share/taste: spaghetti squash, autumn salad, and turkey burger with sweet potato hash. The favorite by far was the spaghetti squash as our conversation revolved around the question of HOW to make this! The food is excellent. The service was \"okay.\" Our server was somewhat nonexistent. Fortunately for her, the food makes up for that here. Yes, coming from a server veteran herself, I did just say that the service can be poor if the food is this delicious. I will be returning on my next visit to Phoenix. Until then, can you PLEASE OPEN ONE IN MINNEAPOLIS?!?",

    "text": "Seeing as it's January and I'm self-imposing a \"healthy eating month\" to counteract the damage done in December, I was really excited to try True Foods.  I went with a couple of friends on a Saturday night, and although it was crowded, we didn't have more than a 20 minute wait.  Most things on the menu looked great - when you're trying to eat light, you're usually limited to 2 or 3 of the more boring items on a menu.  Here, I felt as though I had a solid selection that spanned from a few pretty innovative salads to low carb chicken and salmon dishes.  We split the edamame dumplings, and I got the sashimi tuna salad as my entree.  Both were really outstanding.  The dumpling wrapper was really thin and tasted homemade, and the accompanying broth/sauce had a hint of truffle oil in it - delicious!  The salad had quite a bit of cubed raw ahi tuna with a light miso vinaigrette and some edamame and avocado.  For $14, I thought it was a pretty good deal.    Although I really enjoyed my experience, I can see why this restaurant isn't for everyone.  Portions are intentionally a bit smaller, and although healthy can still be really flavorful, it's not the same as the food you get elsewhere that's smothered in butter or deep fried.  I would recommend True Food for vegans/vegetarians, people who want to go out to eat but are still looking for a healthy meal, or a girls night out.  For large, pickier groups or people wanting a huge plate of food, you should probably look elsewhere.",

What finally sealed the deal was when my friends mentioned something about  ex-cons and anorexics;  combined with  the long annoying wait;  it was just so much easier to head east to new cool restaurants in Scottsdale.    I have to say my recent revisit after 2 years was well worth it.     Food is fresh and presentation is simple and organic.  I forgot how fun it is to go to a health-conscious restaurant.     It's certainly not a meat and potatoes place, and the clientele and staff still look like they need Ensure IV infusion, however, if you want  to eat light  and make yourself  feel like you're eating healthy for a change, this is your place.

However, after 3 trips (two lunch one dinner) and comparison of my fellow diners' meals, the best adjective/expression I can use to describe the fare is \"meh\".  It's just...BLAND.  Fresh and natural shouldn't lack taste, and whether it was the salmon or chicken terriyaki all I could think is that I'm eating a step up from a healthy choice.  Rumor has it that Mr. Fox is taking this concept national--and I'm sure he'll do well as many vegans might consider this a flavor explosion--but Little Lady herself is a vegetarian and I know she appreciates good taste and flavor as much as the next.  Tweak the menu, add some heat, add something and I'll be back....but as is I won't be dining here again.",

    "text": "True Food is full of sensory surprises - and a little full of itself. I genuinely like having such a distinct menu in the neighborhood, but the food, service and entire operation is uneven.   TASTE: pan seared chicken with root vegetables is one of my favorite dishes in the Valley. It not only tastes good, my whole body feels better after I eat it. No zippy sauces, just simply and deliciously prepared. The rest of the fare, like pizzas, teriyaki bowls and signature drinks,  disappoint as often as not.    HEARING: It can be loud as a bar inside - too loud for a concept restaurant focused on conversational food. Our waitress was also one of those softtalkers, so I caught a verb in the specials - and what I believe was a noun just before dessert.   SIGHT - It's an attractive, contemporary space but not well lit, and I couldnt read the printed menu.  We were seated under a Bunyanesque dim sum steamer masquerading as a light source, so I walked under an actual lamp at the bar to read about these entrees they whisper of.  My eyes arent the greatest, but I can drive without hitting brightly clad pedestrians, so for a place to be open over a year and be this opaque seems, well, opaque.   SMELL - There's a perfume of pretense.  Small portions married with high prices, and the whole earnestly ballyhooed dietary schtick whose taste and execution is hit and miss. I will say the servers have been uniformly nice, which goes a long way. They just forget stuff and dont seem to have the cadence and rhythm thing down too well for a Biltmore-priced eatery.      TOUCH - there are some nice touches. The patio is a pleasant place to sit. They wrap up To Go orders really well. The people watching is good (my wife spotted Sandra Bernhard last time).  And you can order things here you probably cant anywhere else. That's notable and fun.   But there's an oddness too. Nothing sinister or belligerent, just amateurish. I'll give you the silliest little example.  You know how top kitchens resemble machines, with staff bustling to make it all work?  Everyone gliding past one another, in a purposeful way?  True Food service seems more an artist colony than machine, compromised by individual quirk and ethic more than guiding principle or practice.     A young lady brought our To Go order to the table. It was in a heavy paper bag and she presented it with a big smile. Perfect.  But when she walked away, back towards the kitchen and bar area, I noticed she was wearing unusually high heels and could barely walk in them. Her job, or part of it, is to walk around - and I'm serious - she can barely balance herself and locomote in these things.  I know that's a goofy little observation but it struck me as emblematic of an establishment too eager to make the wrong impression, and maybe a little confused as to what makes a fine restaurant.",

    "text": "The restaurant has a wonderful atmosphere and is always filled lots of people, music and great food!  Whether dining with a large group or alone, you will never fill like a stranger; the staff is awesome and very friendly.  What really makes this restaurant stand out is the menu!  The menu is filled with gluten-free options--real gluten free options, not just meat, veggies and potatoes--but foods like red quinoa and brown rice pasta!  This is a major for people on a gluten-free diet because there aren't many restaurants that serve these sorts of foods!    During my visit to True Kitchen, I ordered the Ginger Nojito drink, the Wild Halibut with fava beans and red quinoa and the orange sorbet for dessert and it was very good and I was impressed! I think that Sam Fox and Dr. Weil, definitely hit a home run for people with restrictive diets such as gluten-free, soy-free, dairy-free, as well as low sodium and low glycemic index foods.   Now, some folks who do not have health challenges that prohibits them to eat restrictive diets may not appreciate a restaurant like this one.  However, I have been to several restaurants where I leave frustrated and disappointed, because they could not accommodate my diet or offer an alternative, so when I found this restaurant I was elated!  Even though I don't do dairy, soy, or alcohol, I still think based on the number of gluten free items and customer service, I gave it a high rating.  Despite the 5 stars, as always, there's room for improvement such as adding rice milk based menu items to the list.",

Real chopped mushrooms and scallions and it wasn't too salty. It didn't taste like standard powdered miso that you would get at an average japanese restaurant. I also tried the cucumber lemonade which was quite good. Overall the service was attentive and our food came out promptly. My coworker had the seared tuna sliders and sweet potato hash which he looked pleased with. The portions were perfect for what we were in the mood for which was just something really light. It's a great place for lunch, the ambiance is nice especially if you're sitting on the patio. I'm not a huge fan of fusion style restaurants so it gets a 3 star rating out of me, but it's a nice place for a quick healthy meal if you're in the area.",

It was a bit pricey I think but it was well worth the price. It was very tasty with mushrooms, purple potatoes, snap peas and a little asparagus. It had some tasty sauce on it just a little, not too much sort of around the fish. The fish was on top and the veggies were underneath, I will order this again for sure. My hubby had the turkey burger and kale salad and loved it as well.He did say my turkey burgers are better LOL. I do't mind paying higher than usual for dinner as long as it is good and this totally was worth the $24 range.",

    "text": "This review is written especially for other yelpers out there with food allergies:  I was so excited to try TFK because eating out is so challenging for me due to my multiple food allergies (gluten, soy, dairy, egg yolks, and black pepper being the most difficult to get around). I have to be so careful. What a treat to be able to eat out like \"normal\" people.  Bottom line: I was very pleased with my experience and they seemed to take my allergies seriously.  Please note: I am one of those people who had no idea I had any food alleriges (i.e., I don't know that I'm ingesting allergens b/c my symptoms are so subtle), so this review may not be helpful if you're very sensitive. Sometimes I wonder if I'm ingesting allergens despite my best efforts not to.  First, I emailed the company that runs the restaurant, to inquire about their gluten free food/ prep/staff awareness of cross contamination issues, and heard back from someone after about 2 weeks. The response wasn't very specific about their awareness of gf cross contamination/prep, so I soldiered on and asked for more specifics. I actually got an email from the chef at TFK the next day. He explained they use different utensils/pots, etc for GF food, and would be able to accommodate my multiple issues.  When I arrived at the restaurant, our server didn't bat an eye when I laid out my laundry list of allergies. She patiently went over some menu items with me that I might actually be able to eat, but I ended up coming up with my own dish for them to make, and server checked with chef to make sure they could do it for me. I had diver scallops (4) on a bed of mixed greens with some avocado slices and caramelized onions. It was great, though a tad salty (that's what I get for being limited in what spices I can eat!). For this dish I was charged $22, that was the only downside. They actually had some gluten free, soy free and vegan sorbets available, but none of the flavors really interested me.  Service was great--absolutely no complaints.  I think TFK was the only place in the Phoenix area with \"wholesome\" food that I found when searching online that had GF options on the menu.",

    "text": "So I went here last night for a first date and I knew this would be the place he would pick since he seemed kind of hippie-ish.  I was a little wary of this place because of the Yelp reviews, but you're supposed to be open on first dates and all that bs.  I arrive there first, I always do this so I can get a drink in before the date arrives.  Always important to pregame just in case they don't drink or are that awful that you need more drinks to handle them.  But I digress...so I go up the \"bar\" (if you can call it that) and get a Red Moon with vodka.  Really tasty, but I don't need the bartender going over how sustainable their liquors are.  You have MGD on the menu!!!  My date arrives and we head over the table to be greeted by a perky little blond named Kristen.  She was sweet, advised we do the restaurant week menu.  We did, and within moments our hummus arrived.  The hummus was good.  I liked the feta and olives in it.  Then came the first course of the summer salad for me and the edamame dumplings for him.  Again they were good, nothing spectacular yet...  Entrees were next.  I ordered the steak tacos and my date ordered the cod.  So this is where it gets interesting.  I'm all for being green, but I hate when businesses or people act like they are enviromentally friendly because it's the thing to do.  My date had chopsticks for the dumplings and was told he would need them again for cod.  When they took his plate away I jokingly called to the manager who took the plate that he needed the chopsticks and throwing them away wasn't environmentally friendly.  Damn!  Did I get the nastiest look back from him!  Then when we receive our entrees the second manager, Kent, comes over and my date asks him if he returns the freshly unwrapped chopsticks would they go back to the bin so another patron could use them.  This confused and disgusted Kent at the same time.  How dare we ask to put unused chopsticks (STILL IN WRAPPER!) back into the bin instead of wasting them?!  At this point he subtly rips them, hands them back to my date and says he can't return them to the bin.  This whole situation was hilarious for me.  I couldn't believe my date did that and then the manager's actions as well were unbelievable.  They really believe in sustainability.  The rest of the meal was just okay from there.  The steak tacos were bland.  And the lemon olive oil cake I had was just okay.  It was cold, and I like my olive oil cake served at room to warmer temperatures.  FYI for the \"sustainable and environmentally friendly\" restaurant eating buffalo is better than eating beef for the environment.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.sunset.com%2Ffood-wine%2Fflavors-of-the-west%2Fbringing-bison-back-00400000019838%2F&s=ce706ee9de60f903a745c7ecb6384ee5d4e074ba430954dbead00c2f514a5c4a\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">sunset.com/food-wine/fla...</a>  Try adding it to your menu!",

    "text": "For me, this place is amazing! I have to say I don't think it's for everyone though, simply because the food is, well.... True and delicious!  You can actually taste what you are eating, see the flavors on your plate and taste them on your tongue; your palate is not confused by an over abundance of sauce and seasonings like in so many other restaurants.... The menu is relatively limited, which means every plate is consistently good and made to order; having a fresh selection of food and none of that leftover \"soup of the day\" and frozen made-up dishes you get in restaurants with menus that are 3 pages long! They do have a soup of the day, but it's made, as the name says, with veggies available at that time of year at the market - same as I make at home and yes, I recognize what's in it  Last time we dined at True we shared the Edamame Dumplings: I wish we had each ordered a plate they were sooo good!! they were made white truffle oil, dashi and asian herbs, the dumplings themselves were cooked perfectly and the puddle of sauce was delicious too.... we were all looking at the last lone dumpling on the plate: nobody making a move. I was determined to have it so I snaked my hand out to grab it - only to find my nephew's fingers doing the same! we split (tore!) that lil'dumpling in half and smacked our lips in satisfied happiness! The selection of drinks - both alcoholic and non-alcoholic is quite good; there are teas & smoothies, kombucha & juices, beer & cider, martinis margaritas & other cocktails. To follow I had the Wild Mushroom Pizza with roasted garlic, taleggio, asparagus: my favorite cheese and vegs on a perfect sized and baked pizza - delicious  The others had a Steelhead salmon, yum! a Spicy Panang Curry Bowl, I think someone had the Tacos but not sure, I was too busy eating my pizza and drinking my Ginger Margarita to really notice, sorry....and a Spaghetti Squash Casserole that looked amazing. Everyone finished everything so that is absolutely a great sign !! I of course just had to have dessert, so ordered the Flourless Chocolate Cake, another of my faves, and oh my was it good  I had to keep an eye on all those forks jabbing at it from around the table! Do go to True Food Kitchen wether you love good, real food and know all about quinoa and ginger or you want to taste real, good food and maybe venture out a bit into new flavors : you will love this restaurant !",

The weather was gorgeous so we took a seat and ordered sparkling iced teas, they were refreshing and tart and perfect for a fall day.  I split the quinoa burger with sweet potato hash and the chicken chop salad. The quinoa burger was served \"inside out\" with no bun, basically two quinoa patties covering lettuce, tomato, feta and some dill dressing. It was really good and the sweet potato hash was the perfect pairing.   The chop salad was excellent, chicken, canberries, dates, jicama, manchego cheese, almonds and champagne vinaigrette.   This would be a 4 star experience except for the fact that the wait was incredibly long. Long to order, get our food and pay our bill. This is a reoccurring theme this place needs to work out. Otherwise if time isn't an issue this is a great spot for lunch.",

I order the teriyaki bowl and asked for chickpeas instead of one of the protein options listed in the menu - and they had no problem with that. It was delicious.   I appreciate some of the little touches at this place, like when you order water, they give you your own carafe and if you wear dark pants, skirt, or dress, they give you a black napkin to replace the white one that is part of their standard place setting.    The only thing I would change is make it a bit less noisy. Sometimes it was hard to hear my dining companion.",

This time a male server who was extremely polite and professional. He provided excellent customer service and the food was amazing. I love love love their matcha horchata drink. It's delishh!   PREVIOUS review.... Came in for dinner today (Valentine's day). It was pretty slow. The service was absolutely horrible. I've been in the industry myself for over 5 years and have a fair expectation of customer service. We were seated immediately our drink order was taken, however I had to waive the waitress down to ask for an appetizer after the appetizer we waited for 30 minutes and finally had to ask the manager to take our order. The manager was very professional and handled it accordingly. The food was great. Maybe it was an off day for the waitress so I will give it another shot. This was my first time at True food and it was not a good first impression.",

As I said before, everything is good. And, the best thing is everything is super healthy too! I could eat at True Foods every day very happily!",

    "text": "Easily one of my favorite restaurants. I've been coming for years now and it is always on point. Tonight I was blown away again and figured I'd finally write this review. We started off with the edamame dumplings (as we always do) and then we tried the Roasted Artichoke pizza which is a vegan pizza. Let me tell you, it was delicious. The almond ricotta is phenomenal. Even my boyfriend who isn't huge and on vegan food, especially faux cheese, wanted to get another one to go! Everything else on their menu is delicious. Other favorites are Red Chili Noodles, Spaghetti Squash Casserole, Kale Salad, and my boyfriend loves the turkey burger. I always crave this place and I hope they continue to thrive.",

This was the only restaurant in all of Phoenix/Scottsdale Arizona where they had an allergy problem.  I went to their website and basically they don't guarantee no cross contamination.  Seems like they didn't even try.  Also, I noticed their nutrition info.  A vegetable salad w/ shrimp cost me 775 calories ie 2.5 workouts.  Holy moly!",

They have plenty of vegan and vegetarian options for customers along with other delicious meat dishes.  I was not very adventurous as this was my first visit to True Foods. I chose to play it safe and got the Margherita Pizza, which was a 10-inch pizza topped with mozzarella, organic tomato, and basil. As a whole, the pizza was alright and the sauce had a special sweet taste to it that I really enjoyed.   The wait may be a little long and service may take longer if you go around lunch time. Definitely give this place a shot if you're looking for good food and healthier options.",

I got the Kale-aid to drink and it was wonderful. Fresh juice, yum! My entree was a lovely vegetarian TLT (tempeh, lettuce, tomato) sandwhich which also included avocado and veganese. The meat eaters in our group tried the grass fed bison burgers and we're very pleased. Each entree offered a side of kale salad, or sweet potato hash, or the option of \"a little bit of both\", which we all happened to choose and enjoyed. I love that they try and use the freshest, most local, organic ingredients. They have something for everyone. It's a bit pricey, but it's a nice treat every now and then.

We then moved on to an appetizer of caramalized onion tart, with smoked garlic, black fig & gorgonzola.  Again, very delicious, and definitely a keeper.  The main course was halibut street tacos, side of beans with cojita cheese and salsa.  These were just the right size for a lunch entree.

The salad itself was listed at $12 on the menu, but rang up for $12.50. Ok, Fine. But $5.50 to add chicken?!? It's not like you get a whole breast. It's 4 small slices. I was literally speechless when the teller told me the total. Did you raise that chicken from the nest? Did you cut of it's head and clean it out back? No. Nope. Not cool. Additionally, most of the baby kale was still on the stalk to the point where I had to get out a kitchen knife, dump the salad out, and cut it up in to pieces I could actually make sensible bites out of. If you're going to charge that kind of money for a salad, at least take some pride in the preparation and presentation, even if it is to go! So annoyed. The Marcona almonds were good at least.

If they opened up shop on Beverly Blvd, La Brea, or 3rd street in LA they'd get my business all the time.  I was looking for something healthy that was gonna fill me up without weighing me down (was going to a wedding that night), and relatively fast.  For some reason in America, this is a really tough thing to do.  I opted for the spaghetti squash casserole with fresh mozzarella, organic tomatoes and zucchini ($13) and a New Dew drink (honeydew juice, mint, and lime).  I was blown away by the casserole.  Simple, tasty, really nice kick in the tomato sauce, and besides the fat in the cheese, made completely of vegetables.  AWESOME.  I mean, really really great. I'm gonna make the dish at home.  The juice was good,although the honeydew wasn't super ripe like the ones they juice at Fred Segal in LA.  All that said, I was SUPER impressed with True Food kitchen.  Someone there told me they're going to expand.  I'd say bring the prices down a bit (I'd pay $10 for that casserole at lunch any day fo the week), and come expand to LA.  You'll make a KILLING.",

But still the noise level was a bit much.  I think they could have tweaked the acoustics a bit.  Also for a restaurant based on the use of simple, fresh pure ingredients that are locally and or organically grown to create a healthy and flavorful menu; I would expect to find a few more vegan and vegetarian entrees (please note I am neither vegan nor vegetarian, I just prefer veggie dishes). I would also like to see a selection of pure raw food entrees and by raw I don't mean just salads.  Okay, having said that, neither of these issues is a deal breaker nor will it keep me from returning.  Now for the positives; to start off I was told that I would have a five to ten minute wait for a table or I could elect to take a seat at the counter.  I elected to wait for a table and I'm glad I did.  The wait was only eight minutes, so bonus point #1 for keeping with your estimated wait time.  Bonus points # 2 thru 10 go to my server.  Honestly, I forgot his name but on my receipt it shows the server's name as Makyle so I'll assume that is correct.  Makyle was a breath of fresh air, the first thing he served up was a genuine welcoming smile. I can't stress enough how important that is in the restaurant business.  He seemed very happy to work at this restaurant and seemed to have a genuine passion for the place. He started by asking if I have ever been here before and if I knew anything about this restaurant.  When I told him I had never been here and only knew what little I had read. He asked if I wanted to know more and then told me the history and philosophy behind the place.  I found it very interesting and I was impressed by their affiliation with Dr. Andrew Weil and how the entire menu is centered on the principals of Dr. Weil's Anti-inflammatory food pyramid.  Makyle's service was absolutely first-rate.  Possibly the best service I have found in Phoenix other than at a mega-dollar establishment.  Despite being extremely busy he checked in on all of his tables in a timely fashion, kept the water glasses topped off and offered to get you anything you may have wanted like a second drink.  Decor: Bonus point # 11. The decor is very modern-urban-upscale and very appealing to the visual senses. As I mentioned in my opening, they could have done a better job on the acoustics.  Cleanliness: No bonus points. I found it overall clean but with some room for improvement. It looked like they missed a few spots when they cleaned off my table.  Nothing terrible, no sticky mess just not 100%.  So, what did I order and what did I think about it? I started with one of their natural refreshments.  I'm a big fan of fresh juicing and it was nice to see this offered on the menu.  I ordered the Cucumber Refresher and it was just that, very refreshing. Bonus points # 12 thru 14  For my entree I ordered the Spaghetti Squash Casserole.  This dish has spaghetti squash with organic tomato, zucchini and fresh mozzarella, and is served piping hot (bonus point # 15) in an individual casserole dish.  What can I say, it was to die for, it was perfect, the ingredients and seasoning achieved a perfect balance where you can taste every ingredient without anything overpowering any other taste (bonus points # 16 & 17).  Now I almost never eat cheese so I could have done with a little less cheese on top but even so it was not overpowering the dish. I was hungry and found the portion size just right. I'm glad it wasn't larger because it was so tasty that I would have consumed the whole thing. First rate and I will highly recommend this dish.  The experience was wonderful and I will return.",

The hotel recommended True Food to satisfy my needs as well as my non-veg coworker. We went for dinner both nights. The food is fabulous and the service is supreme. Rachel T. waited on us and offered exceptional service. She made sure everything was prepared vegan and that we were happy with all of her recommendations. She was great and if I ever get to travel to phoenix again I will eat at True Food and ask for Rachel!",

It's True that it's on the expensive side and there is a sales nature to the waiters, but if you want to eat some really amazing salads or a healthy lunch that won't leave you feeling weighed down, this is a great spot. Their salad with farm vegetables with manchego and the sashimi tuna salad are two of my favorites.",

The first was to buy a gift card for my daughters teacher & the bartender (the ONLY man in the place who can sell you a gift card apparently~ young guy...fohawk?) ignored my desperate glances for all of 20 minutes before he finally granted me (the sale of) 1 gift card.  So, round two, today.....was told upon arrival (12pm) that it will be 15-25 minutes for the 1st available table, wait 40 minutes before the pager buzzes only to notice she called 8 parties that arrived AFTER us. She couldn't bear to apologize for the loss of our lunch hour~ didn't care or acknowledge that we were standing 10 feet from her while she was piling other guests in front of us.  We spent 45$ (plus tip) on 2 meals that we had to leave behind, because there wasn't time to wait for our food (had to go pick up kids from school).  The waiter was nice, but I don't have a clue where they get all their customers, the pinto beans were yummy, but their fish tacos have nothing on Otro.  Never again, not for me.",

My first trip here I got the butternut squash ravioli (which I don't see on the menu anymore, boo!) and it was perfect! It was spicy, sweet, savory, and creamy all at the same time.  I also had a super-tasty mock-tail called Cucumber Refresher (sooooooooo DELICIOUS).  On a couple other visits I got a cashew-curry pasta dish with chicken (normally with tofu, but they put chicken in it for me....I also don't see this on the online menu...sad face) that was creamy and it makes me drool just remembering how tasty it was.  I LOVE that the restaurant also strives to buy local and be eco-friendly (the staff even wears American Apparel uniforms because they are made in the USA).  I miss living near this place!",

The food is pleasantly above average, and the creative sandwiches, salads, and pizzas make for nice, if somewhat pricey, lunches.   The atmosphere is transplanted directly from southern California, down to the plush seat cushions, use of authentic and fake plants, and quantity of hair gel atop employees' noggins.  However, the staff behaves in an overtly pretentious manner. Ask any specific questions and you will expose their lack of knowledge of the True Food menu. The hostess staff seem to take pleasure in making diners wait for a table. Folks, it's Phoenix, and it's decent, but not spectacular food.   If you have ever been to Century City in Los Angeles and enjoy that kind of atmosphere, then True Food is for you.",

Our very helpful server  went through the entire food pyramid, and told us about Dr. Weil's quest to serve tasty healthy foods while utilizing his pyramid.  Truthfully, healthy was just a bonus and hopefully helped to fight off the negative effects of the two beers I downed however I did think that the food was really fresh and full of flavor.  So much so, that I find myself driving around my home town of Oahu wishing we had one of these restaurants here.  The decor lends itself to a mod industrial green vibe with tan wooden floors, metal chairs white stone counters and pot lights you might see in a 1930's meat packing plant.  Very chic, and very Scottsdale.  Apparently they have a good breakfast and dinner menu as well.  I'll make sure to come back next time I'm in town.  In the mean time, I'll just keep hoping one comes to Honolulu.",
