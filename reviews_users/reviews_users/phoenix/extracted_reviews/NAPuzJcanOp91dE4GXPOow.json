Sit on side patio if you can the ambience there is wonderful!",

It's like having your own Mimosa bar at the table!  Reservation worked out really well as there was a line-up at the door (thank goodness we made a reso)  Interior is super cute and there is a great vibe! Live music was awesome!! Drinks and cocktails were great! Lobster rolls are good, but not the best Ive had.  Probably better to go with more \"breakfast\" options such as the crepes or breakfast sandwiches.  Atmosphere is worth it :)",

We were so hungry and expressed that immediately after being seated.  It was around 4pm and there were only 7 other people in the entire place.    We ordered the fish n chips and it was the greasiest I've ever experienced.  Not to mention it took almost 45 minutes to get the food (again, NO ONE around) and the fried food was cold? Wait, what? Yes, not to mention the fries and fish were cooked in the same grease that had to be at least a week old. Gross!    I left most of the meal on the plate with no offer if something was wrong.  Our server (receipt says Gaddy Lauren) had to have been on something because it was the slowest service during a time when no one was there.  Did I mention the place was filthy?   That was a HUGE $50 mistake. Save yourself and go anywhere else.",

When I found a manager and asked for service, he said he would have someone come right over. Nope. When I finally got up and asked one of the servers if this was her table she said \"it could be\".

Best I've had in years. We ordered a Cesar salad to split but they brought the entree first, so we cancelled it.  For the main course we each ordered a hot lobster roll and it came with potato chips. It was tasty but we ended up reordering the cesar salad because we were still hungry.  I think they should offer 2 sides with the lobster roll to satisfy appetites and make it worth the $20 they charged for it.  That said, I would go back for the clam chowder.",

The first time I was there was Halloween night and we stopped in for a drink and discovered it was Wine Wednesday- they have all bottles of wine for half price and they're already affordable.  So that's a must to check out.  Then I went there for brunch on Sunday and my mind was blown- I ordered their chicken Crepe with the kale salad (no dairy) and it was one of the best things I have eaten in a LONG time.  The crepe was bigger and much more filling than I would have expected and that kale salad is going to be a 'go-to' item when i'm there.  I would highly recommend and I will go back.  We'll see if I try something new or if I'll stick with my crepe.",

The bartender took our order relatively quickly, but seemed to busy to make time to get to know the 4 of us.  (Not a bad thing, we were all talking to each other anyhow)!  We all shared the house made potato chips, deviled eggs, and French fries.  All were pretty good, but the French fries in buffalo sauce was AMAZING. I most definitely recommend that.  The potato chips with house made ranch were good but after having the flavorful fries, they seemed, well, bland.",

We were finally seated after about 40 mins. We ordered cold appetizers and they arrived pretty quick. However when we ordered lunch it was 50 mins after our order was put in that or food finally arrived. I went to use the bathroom and they had fallen short here again no paper towels and no hand dryer. I ordered coffee with my meal and never got a refill until we were done with the meal and read to go. They have a really great location here and good atmosphere but their processes Need a Lot if Work!!!",

My guests and I asked how long the wait was and were told 30 minutes at least. However, there were three open tables right in front of us that weren't getting taken. The hostess we had was unfriendly and rudely asked us if we wanted to put our name down. She was very unpleasant and seemed annoyed that we did want to put our name down. When she did seat us, she threw our menus down and walked away without a smile or any words. Thankfully our waitress was very nice and made up for the hostess.",

This was a very refreshing drink, but not very strong.Watermelon, ginger beer and vodka. I then ordered the Rose Sangria. Now this was delicious and definitely hit the spot. I ordered the burrata for my entree. This comes with grilled bread, prosciutto, fig, pistachio, roquette, and truffel oil. Also very delicious.   I really liked this place.

Tried a little of everything at our table: Lobster roll, Turkey and Egg sandwich and Berry Crepes. I had the high dollar item, hot lobster roll with a kale salad. For $20 I was a little disappointed.  The roll was a standard soft hot dog bun, no toasting or buttering.  The lobster was plentiful but a little rubbery which means its over cooked, but very flavorful with the sauce. I ate it all! the kale salad was heavy on vinegar so I could only eat about 1/2 of that.  The berry crepes looked huge and must have been delicious, the plate was empty.  The turkey & egg sandwich was another plentiful dish with a large side of potatoes & fruit.  I would go for these items before I'd go with the lobster roll next time.",

My friend had her bachelorette dinner here, and while I could not attend, I tried to buy bottles of alcohol for the table for when they arrived. I emailed the management team and called 4 separate times, just to try to coordinate the purchase. After finally getting through to the management team and after the payment went through, they didn't even deliver the wine. Additionally, I had to hear from my other friends that they never delivered it...NOT EVEN THE RESTAURANT! Horrible horrible service. Would not recommend coming to this restaurant.

    "text": "Came here with a friend and she wasn't happy but I'm not hard to to please so I actually liked the place at first. Cool concept, the drinks and the food were good but everyone knows that when you're going out to places like these and spending a bunch of money the service can ruin that very quickly. There first of all was a wait even though the entire outside seating was empty and we told the hostess that we were okay sitting out there. Since the bar was open seating we opted to sit there on the outside side. There were still seats at the end but for some reason they hadn't rolled up the door to give us access to the bartenders but eventually they did and offered us service. Before that I went up to the bar to purchase two drinks and before the bartender handed me my receipt she paused and said hold on and went back to the register. I kind of figured out what happened but she just handed me a new receipt and I tipped and signed it. After checking my online banking my suspicions were correct. She incorrectly charged me the first time and then corrected it and even though she may have reversed the charge, I cannot confirm that because she was not honest enough to tell me about her mistake and what she did to fix it as has happened anytime in my life when a restaurant has accidentally charged me the incorrect amount. So dishonest from a patrons standpoint. Im new to the area and I will not be returning.   I have since spoken to the manager after calling again since I guess the hostess didn't give a manager my info yesterday when I called and couldn't speak to someone so there's that also. He was very kind and apologetic so I upped my review to 2 stars for that but at the end of the day it's about the principle and not money.",

Well this is sorta one of those places.    For an appetizer ordered the tuna tartar guacamole.  Decent portion of tuna, guac was relatively fresh but the pita chips served didn't really do much for it.  Did taste the Serrano peppers but just didn't have the flow.  Tried the house made chips.  Where a bit hard for me and one thing I love is homemade fries.  Lastly had  the fish tacos and while there was a generous portion, the taste wasn't really there.  Not bad, not that good.  Waitstaff was friendly and the atmosphere seemed cool.  Will probably be back to try some different menu items and see how they do.",

It's as if it does not know what it is. Sometimes it is a lovely cafe/bar (not sure about the quality of the food -- never ate there). Sometimes it is an overly loud and crowded mixed-age party bar. When it gets crowded, it becomes unpleasant (and not just for the obvious reasons... hehe). I leave the final decision to you. It is clean and pretty nice.  P.S. Oh, and before you get the Cherry Whiskey Smash, make sure they have the Luxardo Cherries in stock. Otherwise you pay a silly amount for a glorified mule.",

I ordered the Poke chopped salad, and I didn't leave a morsel on the plate.  It looked lovely and tasted just right!  So for that I give it a 5 star salad, and I thought it was fairly priced at $13.  My friend however ordered the fish and chips and didn't eat it as she thought the breading was thick, kind of crisp on the outside and soggy on the inside.  She ate the chips!  I give that a 2 or 3 stars, so somehow I give the restaurant 4 stars because it's very inviting, well appointed, and makes you feel comfortable a if you were not in Phoenix!  Perfect weather and even inside, with all the windows and doors open, you felt like you were enjoying the beautiful weather today.  I wouldl go again!  Good server also!",

Hubby had the steak and egg sandwich (he really liked and big enough to share) and I had the lobster roll. I had to try it, it was tasty and $19. It was on a piece of potato bread folded to look like a roll and I got shoestring fries with it (so many I couldn't finish it all). None the less it was tasty. I am excited to go back and try their burrata or and their German chocolate creeps. I like the motif although not sure they were going for that 80's vibe (bar stools, marble bar, and wicker).",

We were one of many parties, which I think accounted for the lack of attentiveness from wait staff. The brunch selection was fairly extensive, with some traditional New England favorites, like the lobster roll. I would say the food was good, not exceptional, but I think the decor and overall fun atmosphere made up for whatever else was lacking. I would certainly return to try things out again, possibly at a less busy time of day.",

We had about a 30 minute wait so decided to grab a drink while we wait for a table and Tiffani the bartender was very attentive and helped us grab a drink which was great.  Following, our table was ready and we headed there with our drinks and hummus. Our server (Kardi I think, it was on the receipt) seemed not to care too much for that, as our group assumed that she was thinking we weren't going to buy anything else -- which wasn't the case. As we sat, we requested to have just one menu and then she aggressively took all of the menus and rolled her eyes at us for some reason.   She never came back to our table but her colleague saved the day. Unfortunately, we didn't get her name but she was apologetic about the behavior of her coworker and went out of her way to help us out after we ordered some additional food and drinks. Sidenote* he chipotle chicken sandwich was good as was the hummus.  What topped it off for us was our table was actually under Kardi's area for us we assumed, because she came back to our table finally and asked if it was together or separate. At that point she should've given our table to the other kind waitress. The second server even realized the service was out of line because when we got our bill back to pay out, she said \"sorry she was a brat today\". An apology was definitely warranted in that situation but not given. The other server should not have had to apologize for her. My 2 star rating is specifically for the service.",

The place has a Hamptons vibe and the restaurant has a great patio for people watching.  We weren't that hungry and decided to order 2 clam chowders and split a burger. Our clam chowders at $4 was a smoking deal and was a nice hearty portion. This chowder was so good, full of clams and goodies that not only did we eat our portion but we ordered two to go. The chowder also came with two nicely sized crackers to break or dip into the chowder.  The only time I've had chowder this good is when I go to Boston or Connecticut for business.  Yeah it was that good.  When our burger came up, we were honestly already full so splitting it was a good idea. The burger was cooked medium well (although we asked for medium) and had a nicely grilled BBQ flavor. The burger also came with fries. The fries were also of a hearty portion and very tasty. They had a great texture on the outside and were soft on the inside.  There was no skimping in portions or taste at this place.  Overall the service was good, the food nicely presented and for just the few items we ordered, we know that we will return.",

    "text": "Glad we stopped in...Sunday around 5:00...was seated right away. Relaxing beach atmosphere just like its namesake. Awesome staff!   Started with the haystack fries. Shared by four, easily could be shared by six. First thought...spicy!!! But in a delicious way. Shoe string fries perfectly cooked loaded with buffalo sauce and creamy chunks of blue cheese! Winner!! My husband had the clam chowder. In his own words \"excellent\". Served with a huge chunk of a flat crispy oyster cracker.   I had the avocado and pink grapefruit salad with the rib eye add on. Delicious! The vinaigrette was light and perfect with the salad. Even though it said it was a jalapeno dressing, there was no heat. The ribeye was well seasoned. Perfect complement to the dish. Would definitely order again if I was craving a steak salad.   My husband had the prime-rib sandwich. Outstanding. Came with a healthy serving of au-jus, and while he said the bread was dry, it really needs to be that way so that the sandwich can be dipped with out getting soggy.   My daughter ordered the fried chicken sliders. She thought they were really tasty. She ordered the slaw on the side not to make the sliders soggy. The aioli was really good.  My son ordered the cauliflower rice with egg and bacon and added the chicken. He enjoyed it all and commented on how much food there was on the plate.   The restaurant has a lot of outside seating and had a good size bar with a good selection of drinks on their menu.   Excellent food and great atmosphere. Will be back.",

I called the restaurant to let them know what happened and immediately Mike apologized for the error and had the kitchen re -do the whole order and personally delivered it to my house :) The food was delicious and the complimentary  blueberry cheesecake that he added was great!

They only take a few reservations on Sunday's according to the person I called and talked to. Luckily I was able to make one for 15 people without issue. We got there at 10 (right before the real rush of brunch), we ordered drinks (definitely recommend the mimosas with guava juice) and food (avocado toast was delicious as were the breakfast sandwiches with potatoes). We kept commenting on the kitschy decor/knick knacks and great live music (Garth Brooks to Ed Sheeran, and he takes requests).  Every single person in our party had their orders brought out quickly and correctly (usually a rarity with a group this large)! Our server was fantastic, friendly, and efficient. She took our credit cards at the beginning of our orders so when it was time to pay there was no confusion. We were in and out within an hour and a half.   Boyfriend had a fantastic birthday and everyone in party said they can't wait to come back!",

The ambiance is really nice and laid back, gave me the beachy chillax feel (even though Arizona doesn't have a beach...grrr).  The service was meh... it was a beautiful day out and everyone was out enjoying the weather, so it was crazy busy, but still. The first round of drinks came up pretty quick, but then when ordered another round, they never came up... When I asked the bartender, she admitted that she forgot to make them. (No ding in stars, though, just because their watermelon mule was awesome -- I HIGHLY recommend it -- and I was pretty happy by the time I needed to order a second round.) My friend had some cantelope drink, which was not that great... stick to the mule, people!  The food menu looked really good, although I had just eaten so I didn't order anything but drinks. I want to come back for the food at some point, and try that out as well.   As a bonus, while I was sitting there talking with my friends, I kept feeling someone was staring at me... Turns out, it was -- ready for the shoutout?! -- Kristen B.!!! A fellow yelper I met at an the amazing Sol Yelp Event I had gone to a few weeks ago! How awesome is that?! So while the excruciating wait for our second round of drinks to come up, we got to mingle with some amazing yelpers!",

Although I did notice a handful of empty tables across the entire restaurant, which was odd. Anyways I went across the street for a drink. An hour later goes by and the table was ready. We come back and there's still plenty of open table or the same tables. Is getting people to wait an hour part of the hype? I sat down and ordered drinks and food. Food didn't live up to the hour wait hype... Other than that, great location and service was good. Might not return if there's an hour wait and at least 10 open table.",

    "text": "Deliciousness - 2/5 Happiness - 4/5  When dealing with restaurants, food - to me - always outweighs the style and decor of a place. And while The Montauk is heavy on the latter, it is a bit lacking in the former.   Don't get me wrong, the food is fine, but was not notable in any way. I ordered the grilled chicken sandwich and it didn't honestly have a taste beyond, well, chicken. The cheese was very akin to deli slices and didn't add much to it. The fries on the side were also fine but forgettable.  The decor is great though. They have expertly designed the place (and especially the balcony) to resemble a New England-style upper-scale restaurant. I got a real beach vibe despite being steps from super-congested Scottsdale Road. The staff was friendly and accommodating, though the service itself is generally slow.   They do a special crepe brunch on Sunday afternoon and fried chicken on Sunday nights. I am definitely willing to give either a chance given the uniqueness of the meal options and my genuine enjoyment of the atmosphere. Stay tuned for potential updates!",

We didn't get our drink orders taken for about 10 minutes and it took even longer to get in food. Safe to say the service was well below average especially seeing how slow the bar was. I ordered the Rose sangria which I couldn't even finish because although it looked pretty it was not very good. Both my friend and I ordered the yogurt parfait which was pretty tasty!!! The Greek yogurt was a little bland but I loved the vanilla granola and fruit. There was live music which I'm a fan of but it was obnoxiously loud. It was loud to the point where it sounded like the speakers were going to blow out. Ambience was ok, food was great, service sucked",

The people who come here are just always in a great mood. Their brunch avocado toast is one of my favorite meals, especially if its just starting a day-drinking event or curing a hangover from the night before.  Still - it is Scottsdale. Service can be slow with douchey self-righteous bartenders.  Luckily there are also some real serious rock-star staff members who care about good service, and it shows. I don't know her name, but there is one particular bartender who knows how to hustle for patrons.  She is darker skinned with a few small tattoos, but that's all I remember. I'll try to get her name next time.  Wednesday is half bottles of wine-- some of them are great deals.   Definitely make this a stop as the temperature starts to amp up. It is a great Sunday Funday spot for the 30-40 yr old crowd, and one of my favorite places to catch up with friends and admire good looking company.  Just be prepared for a few kinks in service and to pay a few bucks more for the atmosphere.",

Most of the food was decent; our only complaint on food was the chips were covered in truffle oil, which I don't like (description on menu made it sound like plain chips and dip but in fact they had shredded cheese and herbs on top as well). No one checked on us so I picked around for the maybe 1/4 chips without and my husband tolerated eating the ones with and we moved on. As we ate the main meal it was pretty tasty although I did decide that if I were to ever order the fish tacos again I'd ask if I could get the fish without the deep fried batter. We got our bill, paid 15% as we felt the service was ok but not the most attentive we've had. Well, the kicker and reason for our two star review was the waitress complained about our tip. As we were walking out we overheard her tell her colleagues about it. Since we are in town on vacation I figured we'd eat there again, but after hearing the waitress complain with her staff we were so insulted we will not return.",

It's an excessively loud environment and the food is not worth the effort or prices. My husband had a burger which was nothing special; \"very average.\" I had the chicken kabobs and kale salad. The chicken was not seasoned, bland and tasteless. The kale salad was so vinegar soaked it was inedible. Although our server was very good, dinner was disappointing. After one bite of the kale salad, and two bites of chicken, I sent the majority of my meal back, and no offer to comp me the meal or remove it from the bill.  We will not return.",

The food however wasn't too great. My mac and cheese was average and a bit cold when I got it, and all the dishes were very expensive. It seemed like we were paying for the appearance of the place rather than the food quality. Overall we had fun here with the cool music they played!",

When I got up and spoke to the table next to us who had been waiting probably about 15min I told them we had been here awhile and no one had greeted us either.  I let them know I was going to speak with someone and ask for help. I walked up to the ladies at the hostest station and let them know. She said she would send someone over to both tables. About 5min later the waiter working in our area walked up to the2  ladies table first. They were kind enough to let the waiter know we were the ones waiting for now over 30min. The waiter began by saying that he's sorry we are not his table. Someone didn't show for a shift (I'm not impressed...you work for this company every table is your table and you have had plenty of time to high five and serve both tables of either your friends or people you thought were a better use of your time as you passed up numerous times.) We ordered drinks and received them in a decent amount of time. The ladies at the front even helped by bringing water. We now waited another 30 min for this waiter to ask \"did you want food?\" We did order an appetizer...I didn't care to order anything else at this point. The food wad good. However, again the waiter never checked in with us and about 20min later asked if we needed anything else. We said no. He then came over about 10/15 min later to let us know. That \" we have a reservation coming in and you don't need to leave, but they will be here in about 15min and need this table. If you want to move to the bar or whatever you don't have to leave but ya..\" I'm not surprised but...we also had to wait for him to drop off the check as well...I'm dissapointed in this experience. I hope this is not a normal visit here but I probably won't return to find out and I'd advise someone to look elsewhere...Scottsdale is full of other places to go to if not...I'd say sit at the bar.",

Took my parents in for brunch around 10:30 on a Saturday, it seemed chill enough until the DJ came on and bottles start flowing out to multiple tables. My poor father & mother were great sports and didn't admit how annoyed they were we now had to shout across the table to have a conversation. I'm absolutely all for day drinking/day clubbing but at 11am for a place that supposedly takes pride in their food I expected a restaurant not a bar. To add insult to injury 3 dudes that rolled in 15 minutes after us (and we're spending $ on alcohol) got their food BEFORE us - we had 4 simple plates no substitutions - it was obvious management did not care for our business because we only purchased 1 drink and don't mind practicing blatant age discrimination. Well, message received guys! Will never be stepping foot in here again. Shame, because your chef seems to really know what he is doing.",

I believe there was another host working, but she didn't seem to do much at all. I remember asking her for ice at one point and she couldn't even manage that. It seemed like she got cut early- with no shock there. We were prepared for the bar-like atmosphere at around 8:30 on a Friday night- no complaints there but woah- were they busy. Good music was on but a buddy of mine noticed something interesting after we ordered. The original hostess was shockingly more interested in the well being of the customers and restaurant then just about anyone else in that place. She was greeting, cleaning, filling waters- the whole 9. We weren't sure why she wasn't a waitress there seeing as we talked to her more than the person we were actually tipping. Anyway, the waitress that was assigned to us wasn't awful, just seemed very busy with a few other tables- understandable. I had the lobster roll, which I get just about every time I go there and surprisingly, it has gotten better with time. The rest of the group got drinks and had a pretty good night. We figured we'd give that host a tip to commend her for keeping up with that crazy place. Countless dudes at the bar kept trying to get her attention, but she didnt spend much time entertaining them which was impressive and (funny to watch). Checking up on customers is key in the industry. Also, the table next to us was a group of Air Force fighter pilots' wives. They ended up telling us that the host brought the table out desserts free of charge to thank them and their husbands for their service. Unheard of. If They don't keep her, I'll offer her an internship myself! We will definitely be back next Friday",

If you see where I'm going, forget it, because The Montauk is not the place. After months of driving by wanting to try the restaurant, we finally decided to stop by for a Saturday lunch. What better place to have a relaxed lunch, right? Wrong. The Montauk may LOOK serene, but the actual vibe is anything but. Blasting music from a DJ at 11:45 am? I think not. Now, maybe it's because I'm over 30, which everyone else in the place was not; however, The Montauk doesn't seem to know what it wants to be. And the food was just okay. Actually rather flavorless, at least the salads and breakfast sandwiches. Also, if you like mac-n-cheese, you should give theirs a try, but I warn you it has a very smokey taste -- almost like it has pork in it, which for someone who does not eat pork, it was rather disappointing. As for service, our server had to yell and us back at her in order for everyone to hear over the music. The guy who brought the mac-n-cheese appetizer to our table just placed the bowl in the middle of the table. No plates, no spoon to serve.   I won't be back... ever.",

Consistently checked in on us, brought all of our food and drinks in a timely manner, and overall just a great personality. If only every server were  this great at every restaurant. After closing out with Aly we left and ended up coming back later that night. This time we sat at the bar and the bartenders Candice and Caitlin (both cute girls) helped us out. Again nothing but excellent service and a great/friendly personalities. They recommended a series of great drinks and before we knew it was midnight and we had been sitting there hanging out for 2.5 hours. Again, I wish all bartenders were this good and cool. Overall would definitely recommend Montauk and take all of my friends and family there. Awesome atmosphere and great people! Definitely my new go to place.",

We decided to try something new and were quickly seated on the lovely (though loud, due to traffic) patio just in front of the building. The waiter was friendly, though seemed very flustered and new (which is fine - I've waited tables before and get that it can take some acclimating...) He was quick through the first half of our meal, but was having some trouble with another table and slowed down through the second half. (We didn't mind much, as we were catching up.) When we started looking through the menu, I found myself a little surprised at how few entrees were offered. The current menu really lends itself better to happy-hour salads or sandwiches, rather than substantive dinner fare. I settled on the jalapeno and grapefruit salad, which included a variety of great textures, thanks to the pumpkin seeds, croutons and other toppings. I asked for chicken, and was a little less than thrilled to find that the chicken is served cold rather than hot, but at least it was flavored well. I'm sure I'll be back - though I hope next time to see a bit more of a dinner offering.",

We came in Saturday around 2:00pm.  The DJ was good and that was about all.  It was incredibly hot inside, we asked someone to turn the AC down and couldn't feel a difference. If you are going to have a restaurant with large open windows and try to make the outside feel like the inside expect to pay the price by running the AC non stop at 70!  We would have been better off sitting outside.  The service was mehhhh, not good, not too bad.  The watermelon mule was okay, but honestly I make a better one at home.  I ordered a breakfast crepe off the \"brunch\" menu which had bacon, cheese, home potatos on the side and an egg on top of the crepe.  It was horrible; dry, dry, dry.... All together our bill with tip was $75.00.  I am not going back and do not recommend this place.",

They have some of the best clam chowder, in Arizona! The restaurant style is very East Coast, laid-back & beachy. They have indoor & outdoor seating. Overall a really nice restaurant. I will be back during happy hour with my friends.  Sadly the service we had last night, was terrible. Our server was not attentive and very slow to get back with us. By the time I received my entree, my boyfriend had already finished his meal. Fortunately the food and ambiance kept us slightly distracted, from the poor service.",

    "text": "So we had just landed into Phoenix, we had been up since about 3 a.m. Phoenix time (6 a.m. Cleveland time), so we were tired, hungry and just wanted some food. It was a Sunday, and brunch sounded really good. So we are driving around Old Scottsdale, and decided to get out and walk to find a restaurant. One of the first restaurants we happened upon the The Montauk, and it looked like a really good menu. So we go up and ask how long the wait is. Now, we are dressing in tshirt and leggings basically ... comfy clothes that we flew in. Well one of the hostesses eyes us up and down and tells us that they are full. Then another one interjects and said that they have a table they can seat us at right away.   So we go in, and let me tell you, they had the music up like you were in a nightclub. It was 11:30 a.m. on a Sunday. You could not hear the music from the road, so it was very deceiving. It was so loud though, and they had a DJ set up in the booth. I mean, it was kinda cool, but just not what we were expecting for a Sunday morning brunch. Plus it was really hard to hear, and that's a lot coming from a 24-year-old.   It took forever for a server to get to us. She was really nice, but she was overwhelmed, and so we saw her few and far inbetween. On the plus side, we did get some great food and some good cocktails to start our vacation. Maybe if we were a little bit more prepared for what we were going into, or if we hadn't been looked up and down and deemed \"unfit\" to eat there initially, I would have enjoyed the experience more.",

Everything else felt very standard and diner-grade. I ordered the egg Sweet Corn Scramble with the mixed fruit on the side, and it was very meh. I had witnessed the breakfast potatoes on other plates and they seems very diner flash fried and standard, hence the fruit, but alas it was a slice of cantaloupe and a couple other chunks.   My friends ordered the kale salad, egg sandwich, and the food just didn't match the gorgeous interior and fresh, beach vibe.  Skip the hype for brunch, and go elsewhere.",

    "text": "I moved to Old Town Scottsdale from OKC about 7 months ago and I will say after food venturing out to many restaurants around the Phoenix and Scottsdale area that The Montauk is one of my favorites!   Service: The staff is friendly and every time I have been here, I have been seated promptly whether (groups of 2-4). The servers frequently asked if we needed anything throughout our meal and refill water glass/ask to refill drinks.   Ambience: the ambience is divine. I feel so fancy whenever I come here. I can tell that the owners of this restaurant truly wanted people to feel like they're in Montauk, with the beach vibe tones, patio decks, and outdoors-y architecture. Absolutely love it.   Food:  *Brussels Sprout Tacos- I didn't think Brussels sprouts would be great but I've been on a Brussels sprouts crazy and so has all of the foodie world it looks like, so I decided to give it a try and I'm so glad I did. The combination of roasted Brussels sprouts, black beans, and onions inside corn tortillas is heavenly. I've ordered this twice so far. I need to go back for more!   *Turkey + Egg Sandwich - the avocado pesto aioli sauce smeared across one of the buns' insides in my opinion, makes this sandwich that much more better. The fried egg oozes perfectly after sandwiching the other half of the bun on top. The turkey meat was fresh and not Oscar Meyer-y. Okay, I need to go back for this deliciousness as well! I had a side of house salad with my meal--even the salad was amazing.   Drinks:  Skinny Margarita- had this during Cinco De Mayo under a glorious shaded outdoor patio around 3 p.m. Yum. Hit the spot. No salt, yes please.   I highly recommend coming here on a date, with a few friends, for cocktails, or just to feel fancy af.   Check out my food pics from the Montauk on my Insta: @deeps.eats :)",

I had no idea what to expect as we were looking to go to for Mexican food and the place next door (Diego Pops) completely screwed us over.   When we were originally waiting for our table at Diego Pops we went to The Montauk for a drink and LOVED how beautiful and trendy it was. PERFECT for a bachelorette party. We were so thankful that things didn't work out with Diego Pops and The Montauk staff was able to squeeze us in when they were already so slammed (HUGE shout out to the team working on 8/9, we SOOO appreciate you all and had SUCH a blast).   Food and drinks were amazing. Those punch bowls were incredible along with the steak bowls! Everyone loved the food, drinks, service, and atmosphere. Thank you SO much!",

They were super accommodating and patient were our pretty rowdy bunch of friends! I absolutely loved the decor and atmosphere of the whole place! Such fun vibes! I felt like i had been transported to the Hamptons! There was even a live DJ spinning tunes!! As mentioned the staff was all so patient with us, which is often hard to do with a big group of rowdy people!  The cocktails, coffee, and food were on point! It was just what we needed to cure our hangovers from the night before! I often am not a fan of brunch after a night of drinking because nothing really taste amazing and my appetite is pretty depleted! This was not the case here! I had an amazing kale salad and split half a honey fried chicken sandwich with my friend! OMG -- if you're into Fried Chicken sandwiches this is one of the best ones I've had!  I'd def return on my next trip to Scottsdale! Highly recommended!",

Hostess failed to mention with a large party that we where required to be on one tab, and was not brought to our attention until we waited for nearly two hours.   Drinks where empty majority of our experience and table was not bussed as we finished beverages or plates. Food and drinks where good, but I wouldn't recommend this location to friends and I will not return solely based on service.",

About a minute after, a waiter came up and told us that we could sit wherever we wanted. After sitting down, the manager came to us and said it was a 10 minute wait and that we should not have sat down, and then we told him the waiter told us we could sit wherever and he became angry and went to yell at the waiter. The waiter was a very nice guy, but seemed undertrained. It seemed like a managing issue.  We ordered drinks and I ordered a coffee, then we ordered food and the waiter said there was a backup with the coffee machine and it might take longer. I got my food, which was good except for the toast that was so hard it scratched the top of my mouth, and it was a very small portion for what we paid for. Still no coffee. The waiter said the coffee machine was still backed up. I finished my food and told the waiter to just not worry about the coffee.   This place has a good environment and great location but needs some serious work with management. It was quite amazing to me how a restaurant who serves brunch couldn't get the coffee machine to work.",

First off, I LOVE this place. As far as the decor, the location, the feel of things, it's perfect.   BUT, your staff is ruining your establishment. I work in the service industry so I know what is acceptable and what is not. 45 minute ticket times with absolutely no communication, no apology, no \"let me get you a cup of soup while you wait!\" At 40 minutes we politely asked where our food was and the bartender looks at us and says \"well I would check on it, but I know food takes a long time so...\" Are you kidding me?!? That is the most pathetic response I've ever heard. If that were my bartender she'd be fired on the spot.  No one smiled. Not one employee had a smile on their face. Something has to change. Especially when it is season in Arizona and people from all over the country are coming to visit our beautiful state. Have some pride in where you work.   Anyway, I would really love to see this place change around because it's potential is off the charts. Get some people who look like they want to be alive and well and maybe a few extra people in the kitchen. Thank you for your time.",

    "text": "I really like the concept, but the execution needs some serious improvement.  First of all, the decor and style of this place are amazing. You definitely get that New England feel. The place looks amazing and I love the way they've redone the space.  The food is pretty good as well, I had a burger and homemade chips, and they were great.  But then, the service, or lack thereof, makes it all fall apart. I sat at the bar, and the bartender paid enough attention to me to take my order and bring me a drink. Beyond that his situational awareness was completely lacking. He didn't notice when I needed a refill and I had to flag another guy down when I was done and needed my bill. In fact, I was sitting on the patio side of the bar, and while I sat there, a young lady came in and sat down on the restaurant side. Unfortunately, the two bartenders were so engrossed in conversation with some people who appeared to be with one of the liquor distributors, that they completely ignored this young lady. Eventually, after five minutes or so, she got frustrated, gave me a knowing look, and left. The barstaff is probably still oblivious that they lost a customer.   Additionally, I noticed people at tables walking up to the bar and grabbing their own napkins and other items which tells me that they weren't getting service either.  The sad part is that I saw quite a few staff members, but they all seemed to be grouped toward the back of the restaurant where they were talking with each other rather than circulating throughout the restaurant and interacting with customers. In the experience I've had with restaurants and other organizations the lack of customer service usually comes from management and is copied by staff, so perhaps some new management is in order if The Montauk wishes to succeed. Personally, I hope they can turn it around. It's a great concept and one I would certainly support if it was well executed.",

It reminded me of a place in Hollywood where you would be day drinking with dancing and craziness and punchbowls of ETOH.   Ahhhh too thirsty in this AZ heat!  Must drink water!  Two of us ordered one of their fruity teas and 2 ordered cocktails.  I wasn't a huge fan of the tea.  I felt like I wanted to put in tablespoonfuls of sugar to cover that bitterness, but went with one sugar packet.   We did share a moundful of haystack fries drizzled with buffalo wing sauce and blue cheese.  The portion size really was amazing! - couldn't finish it amongst 4 hungry ladies.  The fries were all nice and crispy though!   Then I ordered the basic avocado toast $8:  smashed avocado on grilled bread with a fried egg and a side of fruit.  Additional $3 for bacon.  I thought that the 1-inch grilled bread was way too big for the amount of smashed avocado.  I could barely taste the avocado!  I wish there was a moundful of avocado.  I liked the egg on there, which actually came out more like sunny side up vs fried.  No biggie.  I had a plentiful mound of bacon!  But still wished for more avocado.  The fruit was ripe, fresh, and refreshing.  Overall, I think I enjoyed the atmosphere more than the food.  I'll have to try something else on the menu next time.",

Great for groups and family gatherings. Will be back again",

And our service was completely lackluster...not unfriendly, just absent.   we were seated at a booth that was covered in food crumbs. I asked to have it cleaned only to now have a soaking wet seat, which i opted to dry myself rather than ask the staff again to clean the table. we waited long periods of time between drinks, water, food, bill, etc. She just was never there and we had to flag her down for nearly everything.   if you don't eat meat, your options are miniscule. I had the green curry shrimp. it was good, i ate it all. it was fine, but nothing i would re-visit. for the steep 16 bucks , i can get a giant bowl of shrimp curry at a thai restaurant.  it's probably fun to sit here when it's sunny and have some drinks, doing some people watching.",

We got guava, pineapple and grapefruit. All fresh squeezed and delicious! It was a great deal too because each mimosa costs $8 and we both drank about 4 and 1/2 by doing the bottle deal. So since we split it, it was $20 each instead of $24+  The food was also fantastic! I order the sweet corn scramble that had corn, kale and peppers and my friend got the breakfast sandwich that came with avocado. The side of fruit was delish and you could tell it was fresh and not from a can. And the home fries were crunchy and perfect! There were tons of good things on the menu, it was so hard to choose! Next time I'd like to try the Crepes.   And there will definitely be a next time! I recommend this to anyone looking for a nice Sunday funday! The restaurant is tastefully decorated with the nautical theme and they had a live Dj there for brunch. The staff was all very pleasant and parking was easy to find. Two thumbs up!",

We sat inside but the patio is extremely inviting and will request outside next time we visit.  The menu is fantastic in my opinion with a nice selection and very well organized with offerings for every taste...and healthy too!  I opted for the Cauliflower fried rice with grilled chicken, over easy egg.  It was delicious. It reminded me of a dish I often ordered in India Nasi Goreng which is a favorite of mine.  The flavors blended wonderfully and could have easily been an vegetarian dish minus the strip of bacon and egg.  I also decided to try the Watermelon mule which was quite refreshing and tasty.  There were several items on the menu that I will be back to try as well as the brunch menu on line looks tempting!",

A little frustrated as the service here is typically a bit slow. This 5 Star review is for Bailey. Once learning that we had been waiting for a while and that I had limited time since I was on my lunch break, he took our order immediately, made sure it came out quickly, fixed my drink when the soda was flat, all while being extremely accommodating and a friendly. He seriously turned this lunch around by being kind, taking responsibility, and being apologetic.  I'm so impressed by his eagerness to really go out of his way to make our experience better. That's not something that seems easy to find when talking about the service in old town. Thanks Bailey!!",

The waitress brought us water upon greeting us and knew to split shared items on our bill without asking. Probably the best service I've had during brunch. My friend and I split a bottle for the table side mimosas which is cheaper than ordering a few mimosas separately- it also comes with three juices of your choice. Normally, I order French toast or pancakes, but the warm lobster roll was calling my name. The lobster roll was flavorful, although I wish the roll it was in was a bit larger, so the lobster chunks weren't falling out with each bite.

The first time that she served me she highly recommended the Brussels and those were delicious!  A few weeks ago I had brunch here for the first time and they have an excellent brunch menu.  I shared the burrata cheese and had the avocado toast and a side of potatoes.  It was the first time that I've ever had an egg on avocado toast and it was superb!  I like the crowd here.  You find a lot of professional people in their 30's that are dressed nice and not in the condition that you find at several places not too far away.  They have lots of seating indoor, outdoor and at the bar.  They also have lots of misters outside, which you definitely need in AZ.  I have friends coming to visit me in a few weekends and I'm looking forward to our first stop to be here.  I know that they'll love it as much as I do!",

I think it was some sort of wheat bread. The veggies with the hummus was great. We also tried the devil eggs with truffle oil. Yum!! But you should have more than two people in your group if you are going to order the eggs.  Main course for me was Brussel sprout tacos. So amazing! Flavor was great. I highly recommend them!

Awesome table side mimosas with delicious juices. The berries and cream crepe was too good for words- not too sweet like you would guess. The crispy potatoes were a huge hit. The best part though was our server Morgan! Hilarious and extremely thorough. He went above and beyond for us and made it look easy. 100/100! Thank you for making our Sunday the BEST.",

We ordered avocado toast and breakfast sandwich so cold eggs really ruined the taste. Also egg on the breakfast sandwich was ordered over easy and were not served runny at all. Waitress was very nice but visibly flustered- apologized a few times for being chaotic. Also twice we were almost served someone else's food so food running / table numbers seemed to be a problem. It's a super cute place with a lot of potential - we just didn't have a good experience.",

So, I chose the only thing that sounded good...the \"bacon and egg crepe.\" Strangely it had what seemed like THREE WHOLE ONIONS in it and there was one egg on top of the crepe opposed to inside it? It was basically inedible. Honestly one of the worst menus I've seen and worst meals I've had at a Phoenix restaurant.  I also had a bite of my boyfriend's sandwich (some kind of rib eye breakfast sandwich) and it was tasteless. The service was also horrendous: our server was rude and the food and drinks took a ridiculous amount time.  I wouldn't go back to this place to eat if someone paid me.",

I ordered the lobster roll and my wife went for the smoked salmon crepe. Both of these offerings sounded really good; however they proved to be pretty disappointing. My lobster roll was just OK, which I guess is understandable since we are in Arizona and not in Maine. The real disappointing dish was my wife's crepe; it barely had any smoked salmon on it! Service was pretty poor, they had about 10 people serving but they seemed more interested in chatting with the customers or each other instead of serving the patrons. I'd also have to agree with Aaron S. on this place being overpriced for the quality of the food and service. I wouldn't say it was our worst experience, but it was sadly below mediocre!",

The ambience of this place seemed pretty cool and would seem super fun on the weekends. However, service makes all the difference at a restaurant/lounge. I love going to places that have a good atmosphere but ALSO great staff and welcoming service. This place however, did have only 1 of those 2. The service and customer service need some working on. They did not check up on us once while we were sitting at the bar. Also, the couple behind us waited for a while before getting seen by a waitress and it seemed they were all pow-wowing in the corner. Maybe it was the workers working that day. But All in all, that is why I give this place 3 stars but the ambience and food seems great.",

The main issue I have (despite the service, which I will get to in a moment) is that they have taken a very great idea and turned it into a boring Scottsdale restaurant.  I brought a group of friends here to pre-game and have dinner before going out for an evening, enthralled at the idea that someone could recreate the magic of the surf lodge. We were let down at every turn, from the blaring top 40 music to the nearly pitch-black lighting the whole ordeal was bewildering.   It was a Saturday night but very few people seemed to be eating as I made numerous strolls through the place to check out the decor and vibe. Despite this, it still took about 45 minutes for our food to get to the table, terribly slow.   I got to try a number of different items and was thoroughly unimpressed by all of them, particularly my cold lobster roll. I'm not sure what type of lobster they use here but they include a gigantic side-portion of butter, presumably so that you can eat the thing.   I think that with some changes this could be a nice restaurant but the concept doesn't make sense to me, it is the restaurant equivalent of a bait and switch.",

The food here is decent at best, as mentioned before, it takes hours to receive, and overall you just don't get what you paid for (unless of course you paid to be unhappy and dissatisfied).

Beautiful weather to enjoy watermelon mules and people watch.  The location is prime and from what we gathered a very popular spot among the locals.

Perfect spot for my macaroni pregnancy cravings :) the only reason I give it 4 starts is because there are several unbelievable 5 star restaurants here I love and this doesn't seem to fall under the same rating, and the drinks all seemed to have more ice than beverage to us.

Super fresh, creamy and a pretty good portion for the two of us to share  For the meal we ordered the cauliflower fried rice and kale salad w shrimp.  Both were really good! After trying the \"fried rice\", i was pleasantly surprised.  Excellent flavor, and a little lighter than rice would be, and such a unique dish. The kale salad was hearty and plenty!  I liked that their menu selection wasnt too much, but what they had was well selected. We didnt mind that the service was a tad slow...it was nice to enjoy the people i was with, and never felt rushed.",

We began by sharing a generous bowl of one of the best clam chowders we have ever had, including some of the best along the New England Coast.   Then we shared the warm lobster roll to our great pleasure. The perfectly toasted bun was loaded with large pieces of lobster, topped with a delectable sauce, along with their shoestring fries.   Our bet on throwing caution to the wind paid off in spades. This was one of our most delicious and most unique meals in Old Town Scottsdale.   Service was friendly, competent, and efficient. The atmosphere was inviting with a unique building design, pleasant but lively recorded music, and a calming outdoor patio that's great for people watching.   So we say, go to The Montauk and throw caution to the wind! Next for us will be a lunch, happy hour, and dinner in the near future--on different days of course. :-) The Montauk is a winner.",

    "text": "Interesting spot. Reminds me of a California beach house. I can see Zack Morris and company hitting the bar at this place.  Aside from the look of this place not much else to keep a customer interested. I ordered the cold lobster roll and a corona . The roll was a hawaiian sweet roll. The lobster was pretty bland and didn't have much mayo. It came with a side of white milk that they called butter. Not sure how that's possible since it was flavorless. I asked for Mac and cheese for a side . It was tasty but the macaroni was a little undercooked, and this is from someone who likes his pasta al dente.  The staff was somewhat attentive but not what I would expect for it being as empty as it was during lunch. The bartenders even had time for some horsing around with each other. No conversation was had beyond the food and drink.  Lastly the prices are pretty average for Scottsdale but still overpriced for the quality of food and service. Ive been here more than once and say the biggest problem is consistency. I'm not too sure if I would return.  Tip: Avoid weekends if you don't like crowds or noise. They blare music during \"brunch.\"",

They're really good but a little on the pricey side.  As for drinks and food for lunch/dinner, I'm a huge fan of the fish tacos. The fish is fried, but they always taste super fresh and have such good favors! For an appetizer or a side, I definitely recommend the buffalo fries. They're little shoe string fries with buffalo sauce and bleu cheese crumbles. Yum.  Overall, the service is ok, but it's the perfect spot to go for any kind of Occassion. Delicious drinks and fun and a fun atmosphere!",

We went for restaurant week and got a 3 course set up.   first off best thing about this place is they are flexible.  most restaurant weeks don't let you make any substitutions our waitress Michelle was very sweet and accommodating.  My wife and I got the burrata, scallops, and desert.   I got a apple strudel which was good, but I really wanted KAY like pie which they ran out of.  my wife because they ran out of the pie asked for a crepe instead which they custom made for her because she didn't like the crepe options.   Literally everything was amazing.   the scallops are not on menu yet but they are coming.  we'll be back as soon as they are on there again!   the burrata was incredible so I highly recommend it.   for drinks the wife got the endless summer and loved it.  I got this whiskey smash drink that was bomb.  it tasted like a cherry Coke but has interesting twists in it.   as far as some of the complaints about the music.  yes it is  loud and even though I deducted a star for that.  I wouldn't say it's something that should deter you.  if they just turned the music down literally 2 notches it would be perfect.   I'll be honest though I think the volume of music actually fits the scenery as it's supposed to be a cool upstate montalk bar.  so I think it accomplishes it.   we sat in a booth next to each other and could hear each other just fine.   I would imagine the happy hour scene and brunch scene is awesome here.   it's super cool set up inside and very welcoming.  people wear a big range in clothes.  I wore jeans and a button up.  a lot of guys had t shirts and shorts.  some had slacks.  so you won't be under or over dressed no matter what you wear.   anyway go!  we loved it and we will go again.",

One because I appreciate the fact that it's opening week and they are working out the kinks and the second because the manager came over to take responsibility for my meal not being to acceptable standards and took it off the bill.  I had the fish tacos per the recommendation of our server who said they were the best thing on the menu. The piece of fish (pictured) was no bigger than 2 small French fries so it was mainly cabbage and a soft corn tortilla. The manager said she spoke to the chef so I'm hopeful that they will make the necessary adjustments. The irony is that I understand this place is owned by Diego Pops next door which has great tacos so not sure what happened here.  Two of my friends ordered the French Dip which were both delivered minus the actual \"dip.\" The buns were also served without the creamy horseradish dressing. The server apologized and brought out both. The dip was good however the creamy horseradish tasted like spiced mayonnaise. Overall, just fair.  We may give this place another shot but not until they get their menu together. There are too many other great places nearby that have great food for the same price points..",

The service was great, we had our kiddos in tow and everyone was real attentive to them and helping us know what to order for them.  Mac n cheese was a big hit!  All the food was yummy!",

The draft beer wasn't working but she and the manager came over, talked to us, and it didn't matter! Their personalities more than made up for it. Their menu recommendations were so on point. We had the tuna tartare guac, fries, and Mac and cheese. As they said, they were all life changing. A group of five of us were reuniting as ex co workers and the setting was perfect. We were on the upper area, lounged in the couches and chairs, caught up, and had a great time. The service was impeccable and the food/drinks never stopped flowing! My first time here and can't wait to come back!!",

Gone is the dark wood work and replaced with lighter decor and cool metal chairs.    I want to first give a shout out to the great staff and our server (Mary I think her name was).  Multiple staff greeting us during our visit as well -  you can tell they place an emphasis on customer service.    We only stayed for Happy Hour, but I'd strongly recommend the kobe crumb mac and cheese and crispy chicken drum sticks.  Both were cooked to perfection, if I wouldn't have drawn attention to myself I probably would have licked the bowl that the mac and cheese came in.  Thanks for a great experience Montauk - we'll be back!",

Only issue I come across is they very often have bad waiters/waitresses that take a while to get your order. Even when not busy they will just stand around forever and not do anything. You can be a few feet away from them trying to order and they will flat out ignore you. It's very bazaar. Kelly's at Southbridge is a better alternative.",

We tried the Gouda Mac and the burrata appetizers with a big punch bowl split between 6 people which was worth the price ($75) for the amount of servings. Tip: if you check in you can get 2 for 1 drinks. From the lunch menu we had the house made potato chips with French onion dip which was certainly a recommendable starter or snack to share along side tasty cocktails. I'll definitely be back to try their lobster rolls next.",

They're known for their grapefruit mimosas and the \"spark plug\" which has Smirnoff vanilla vodka, Irish cream liqueur, cold brew coffee and coffee ice cubes. It's very open and in the heart of old town where you may walk to several other restaurants and shops. You may sit inside or they have a sun deck area or a patio in the front and back areas. I like their avocado toast and breakfast sandwich for brunch. Typically my bf and I will just come here for a cocktail. Come check it out!",

Only thing was the food is a little pricey for its portion but other than that, the service and food is really good or maybe it was the time of day I came in??   We started off w the crispy rock shrimp  it was amazing!!! It was so good, we had to have it again!! So i ended up ordering two of the crispy rock shrimp appetizer!! I highly recommend it!! Perfect amount of crispy and spicy, tangy sauce~ my mouth is watering just talking about it    My other gf highly recommended the avocado + pink grapefruit salad w added shrimp but I didn't feel like spending $16 on a salad so I ended up ordering the cauliflower fried rice. It was good!! Loved the bacon and edamame~   My friend got the warm lobster roll and she couldn't get enough of the brown butter aioli that comes w it! So I'm assuming she really enjoyed it. The sandwich comes w ur choice of housemade chips, fries or kale salad. The chips were good too.  And we even shared a dessert. Forgot what it was called but I added photos of everything. Overall, just know that portions are smaller n pricier but all very tasty.",

There is a definite coastal feel, which was practically an oasis after exploring the desert of Scottsdale during the day. Our waitress was helpful and noted this is a rather popular brunch spot. For an evening, we were pleased to be seated immediately on the patio. Because we visited in January, there was a heater on the ceiling that kept us warm & comfortable.  I did not eat, but both of my parents enjoyed their meals. My mom was very impressed by her cocktail- I believe it was Sangria. Our only complaint was that either the table is too high or the chairs were too low which makes for an awkward posture while eating or during a conversation. Be sure to 'check-in' on Yelp as I received a first-time coupon for 2 specialty cocktails for $12 (the regular menu price). All in all, a great spot!",

She definitely set the tone for a great meal and experience :) I checked in on yelp so I was able to get the check in offer 2 signature cocktails for 12$. They're typically 12$ each. I went with the coffee cocktail with a cold brew ice cube. I loved it. My friend ordered the watermelon mule, also super good but I preferred my drink. Hers would be better for a summer afternoon, super refreshing.  For appetizers we ordered the happy hour burrata, macaroni and cheese, deviled eggs, and shrimp. Everything was really good and surprisingly the burrata was my favorite appetizer. The bread is well buttered, I love truffle.... and the fig with burrata-to die for. Yum!

I went for happy hour for the first time yesterday and double checked with the waitress what exactly the \"well cocktails\" would be since they don't have a normal happy hour menu like pretty much every other restaurant. From our conversation, I was told the cocktails would just be made with lower-shelf alcohol which was fine, so I ordered 4 drinks and a side thinking I'd be paying half of what my bill was.  When I mentioned the conversation we had and that the bill was incorrect, they basically gave us a few bucks off and sent us on our way. I'm 100% not one to cause a scene or get mad, so we just paid and left. I bring a lot of new people here but I won't be coming back again. If you want a crappy hour, feel free to try Montauk.",

Service was outstanding and our waitress was very attentive! Our appetizers were delicious and I highly suggest the house potato chips and haystack fries. The only complaint I have is the entrees. I have been looking for a good lobster roll in Phoenix but unfortunately, this was not it. I ordered the warm lobster roll and it was incredibly soupy, so much so that I had to eat it with a fork. As you can see in the picture it was so runny that it was spilling out of the roll. Really disappointing for a $20 sandwich, and there was so much aioli that it overpowered the lobster. Would have been much better with just some lobster meat and butter, the aioli ruined the entire thing. Also had the cauliflower fried rice and salmon tacos and they were really bland. If the lobster roll was better would have definitely been a 4 or 5!",

I'd say that I'll give it another try but honestly, we have so many amazing places in Scottsdale and Phoenix that I'll go somewhere else. Food was fine but I was tired at that point and fine didn't cut it.",

We were faced with a 45 minute wait at The Breakfast Club and I didn't feel like standing around outside there. So Montauk was a good alternative.  There were small families there as well as couples which gave the place a good vibe. It reminded me of someplace on Fire Island...kind of breezy and airy. No ocean of course but the decor gives it a light atmosphere.   I'll definitely go back and try more.",

    "text": "I'm pretty sure I came here once before shortly after they had opened, and remember it being just fine for Happy Hour. Nothing really stood out, but like I said...just fine. Recently wanted to check out a new HH place and since I hadn't been to The Montauk in awhile I made it my \"new\" place to try and I'm glad I did because I LOVED it.   Seriously, The Montauk has a really good HH. $3 drafts, $4 wells, and $5 wines. And the food is really good! I was really surprised how big the portions were considering how low the prices are! They have about 10 things to choose from and nothing is more than about six bucks. I came with my mom and we each got a bowl of clam chowder ($3). I liked it because there was a really good amount of clams in it but wasn't too thick. We also got the burrata, rock shrimp, and chips w/french dip. We really could have done w/only two of these but we figured the portions were going to be small (they weren't), and why not try a lot when things are around $5 each? The fig & pistachio in the burrata was yummy & I really liked it combined with the arugula! The rock shrimp was served w/this sweet buttery sauce that was so good! We actually used some our our chips from the french dip (because there was so many of them!) to dip in it! Speaking of the french dip, it was delicious! It was actually kind of light and not too thick & onion-y like a lot of these dips tend to be.  Our waitress was attentive & nice. We came here on the earlier end of HH (around 4) & I wouldn't say it was packed, but there was still a pretty nice crowd for early in the day. I'm already planning on coming back soon for brunch (the menu looked good) & of course Happy Hour.",

Our server went on break and sat across the bar from us and began feeding fries to other servers with her legs up and open from across the bar. We were a little shocked by this, but maybe this is normal here? We asked for a little more bread with our hummus and waited so long we asked for our check before It came. We then paid and was then brought out our bread as we were leaving. They also charged us for this. Great looking place inside, but wish the service was better. Has some great potential.

    "text": "I wish I could give more than 3 stats because this place totally redeemed themselves for their mess up, but I just can't for a few reasons. I called weeks prior and made a patio table reservation for dinner for 16 people, a Bachelorette party visiting from out of town. This place came highly recommended from a couple friends so I was excited to check it out!  It was St Pattys Day.. by 7:30 we walked up and the restaurant was bumping, the DJ was so loud inside you literally wouldn't have been able to have a conversation. I saw they had a big table set up right next to the bar and told them we definitely don't want to sit inside because our reservation was for the patio. After 10-15 mins of waiting, yes all 16 of us there, they told us we could wait on the front patio and order a drink because our table wasn't ready yet. After ordering drinks and waiting for another probably 15 mins we were told the owner showed up and wanted our table... pretty sure any business owner who cared about their patrons wouldn't take over their table, but that's just my thinking! I spoke privately to the person who was communicating with us and kinda called him on this BS, he was super nice and said he would try to work things out. Another 10 minutes later he said our original table was ready and apologized by bringing us complimentary champagne, very nice gesture! The service was great, they brought apps out immediately - considering we waited about 45 minutes for a reservation, but unfortunately some of the food was SUPER salty. Warm lobster roll, not good. Brussel sprout tacos, yuck. The cauliflower rice dishes tasted like a whole bottle of soy sauce spilt into it. I would recommend a lot of the small plates: hummus, buffalo fries, ahi nachos and wings. The cheeseburger was really good too. All in all, I'm super grateful they redeemed themselves and worked it out along with taking care of some things off of our bill, but all of that never should've happened in the first place. If in fact the owner really wanted to take over our table, makes me not want to give this establishment the time of day again. It was Dante and our sweet server, didn't get her name- who made the experience go from a negative to a positive.",

He  entered my cell number and I subsequently received a confirmation and to expect :30 to :45 minute wait, no problem, knew what we we were signing up for and it was very busy. An hour elapsed and I checked in again to see status of my reservation.  They had no record of me having even made the reservation and quickly placed the blame on ME for not being available when they called me up.  I showed the hostess the confirmation text, and confirmed that there was no communication beyond that.  ZERO apology! The only fix was to promise an outside table within 10 minutes.  Time elapsed with no outside table available, so we accepted an inside, only to be told by our waitress that the kitchen was \"backed up\" and that the minimum wait for service would be another :30 minutes.

We had the most amazing food and the staff...I can't say enough. We never wanted for anything. I created a yelp account just to let people know how wonderful it was. I have been in the industry for 15 years and I can definitely say that this place was created with True passion. I am not impressed very often, today I was blown away. My compliments to the chef, while I would not wait an hour for the Breakfast Club, I would wait an hour at the Montauk. It was that good.",

At least now I better understand why there was no one else in the restaurant. We started with the artichoke, which we had to send back because it was not cooked. The fish tacos were OK if you got a good piece of the fish but some bites were terribly fishy and tough. They came with french fries, which were lukewarm at best. They tasted like they may have been reheated. We ordered a side of sweet corn, which tasted like something in heavy butter, but certainly not sweetcorn. The side of steamed brussels sprouts was the best thing we ate. On the bright side, the service was excellent. You would hope so since no one else was in the restaurant but the young lady was very sweet and attentive. (Aliana.)  There are so many incredible an outstanding restaurants in old town Scottsdale and throughout the valley. I can't imagine why someone would spend their money and calories here.",

They have a great outdoor seating with big comfy benches and chairs great for sitting with friends and enjoying some happy hour goodness . They have one of THEE best happy hours in old town . 3$ for a fresh squeezed IPA ?!  They also have an array of hand crafted cocktails and other beers on tap but the fresh squeezed is where it's at . The food on happy hour is equally impressive , the bruschetta and and Buffalo hay stack fries are my favorite but I also have a place in my heart for the chicken sliders . The atmosphere is wonderful from the bar area , patio down to the well kept bathrooms . Definitely check this place out on happy hour or for a nice lunch/dinner cheers!",

I have sincerely given him the benefit of the doubt in spite of the decline in service since he's started. However, all good things must come to an end. Today, I was served chicken wings that were spoiled. I took one bite and immediately tasted that sour taste that you typically smell when you open a package of chicken that you waited too long to make. They had to have smelled it; the spoiled taste was strong. I sent it back and told the server that they need to take care of our meal. The manager came over, apologized, told us they would take care of it, and asked us if we wanted anything else. We ordered deviled eggs and a salad and they were good as usual. They took the spoiled chicken off of our tab and charged us for everything else. I'm not sure if they think that we should be appreciative of them taking the spoiled chicken off of our tab, but I paid it and left. Spoiled chicken is a sure way to get food poisoning. My guess, they don't care. I will take my business elsewhere. I'm thinking Farm & Craft.",

I was visiting from California me and my best friend were trying to decide where to go we wanted to go to Houston's but wanted to try something new as well and we decided on this place. We walk in and there's some solo guy singing country music which was very random on a Sunday day at 2 PM it was not that busy and took us about 15 minutes just to get seated. It took about another 15 minutes for somebody to come over and take our order and then we waited about 20 minutes for two drinks and no waters were brought over this entire time. Then we had ordered the shrimp after 45 minutes of waiting for an order of shrimp appetizer it came out ice cold. Then the waitress brought it back to the cook the cook clearly took the cold shrimp that was supposed to be hot and moved it on a hot plate and they brought that back out to us. Then the Mack and cheese appetizer we ordered came out cold and had bologna in it which was not listed on the appetizer menu. Then the french fries we ordered came out cold as well. We were there about 2 1/2 hours with three horrible appetizers and only one drink each between us the waitress was awful the food was awful the only way it ended well is because the manager comped our measly $50 meal.

When I asked the bartender Veronica how the tuna tartare was she said \"oh it's good it's not like the tuna from the can its a different tuna\" ummm Duhhhhh but ok I said is it Ahi, she said not sure but it's not from a can. Ok then! I proceeded to ask what the difference of the lobster on the salad was in comparison to the lobster on the lobster rolls .... She said \"oh I don't know it's shredded lobster\". I said ok but what part of the lobster is it from the claw or the tail or what ?  She said \"the inside\" of the lobster. WOW!!! Pls train and educate your staff. Thanks.",

We heard live acoustic music going on inside. I ordered the jalapeno chicken sandwich and while it was really tasty, the piece of chicken was very small on a huge bun, so that was disappointing for a $12 price point. The waitress was friendly (basic friendly, not overly welcoming or talkative by any means) when she was around but the problem was she was barely around. After someone else delivered our food, she never came back to check in. We had been done eating for awhile and still hadn't seen her in awhile so I had to flag her down to get the check. Even then, it sat there for a lengthy time with our payment waiting for her to pick it up again. We were there a lot longer than what we should have been. She was a pretty non-existent waitress...and people wonder why they don't get good tips?",

The restaurant has a cool, funky vibe, complete with a DJ. Definately the place to see and be seen,but has the service and cuisine to back it up!!!

Also had the tar tare guacamole it was delicious as well, lastly I had the warm lobster roll which was good , the only 2 things I didn't care for were the old lemon slice on the top, not appetizing at all and the second is the domain lettuce it was wilted and had to be removed the sandwich would have been better served with out the lettuce and with a fresh slice of lemon. The music is a little too loud for lunch hours too we could barely hear each other talk at times. All in all you gotta try it here it's a nice place with a great street view and some good food.",

No salmon.  They said it was on the inside.  Hmm....never found any. We got a couple of salads after that.  Ingredients missing.  A waiter gave us excuses about how they didn't expect a crowd today.

I use to work right across the street from this place so I would often come in on lunch breaks or eat at the bar.  The reason I am not giving five stars is that I feel like the service really needs work!  I have an hour for lunch, and I literally spend sometimes more than an hour there especially when I order right away and tell them I have to be back to work.  When I asked how long on my food order I would get a snarky attitude from the bartender and say that it will be out shortly.  Again I would love to give this place 5 stars but I definitely feel like the service needs to be worked on, not sure if it's the server/bartender putting in my order late or the kitchen",

The chef came out to apologize and offer a free app. Once we ordered, the food again took over 30 minutes to come to the table. There was little apology and not even an offer for a round of drinks for the terrible wait-time and service. I would NOT recommend this place to anyone again. I was entertaining 5 guests from out of town. I even told the waiter this and that I was embarrassed to have brought them. I never saw a front-of-the-house manager. What happened to this place?",

She was pleasant and extremely attentive. I ordered the cold lobster roll. I enjoyed it both times I was there but this time was better then last time. My husband having celiac disease ordered the prime rib and egg sandwich without the bread. Michelle checked to make sure that his original side choice was gluten free... it was not.. so he chose another. He enjoyed it and said that is what he would order again.   Having been to Montauk (the real town on Long Island in NY many times... you can take the girl out of NY..can't take NY out of the girl) the decor of the restaurant screams beach. We intend to return again...and again...",

It seems to be more for the drinkers that could care less when their food comes.  I have attempted three times and all three times it is the same old same old.  Empty tables and the kitchen can't handle it.  This is ok once in a while, but every time?!  So, if you are wanting to try out this fabulous menu before or after a play or movie...be prepared to wait over 45 minutes for your food.  So sad.  So disappointing.  \"Mikey\" right in my face told me he basically could care less if I ever come back.  This was his attitude when I asked him what was going on with the food taking so long.  Supposedly he is the manager.  So unprofessional.  49 minutes to get our food.  I was warned up to 30 but 49 was just not right and what was even more wrong was \"mikey\"!",

Morgan and Mikey will forever be my favorite server duo! Best service, understanding of the full menu, anything our huge group needed we got right away. I even ordered an old menu item, and they honored it for me. I have been coming here since they opened, and a few things have changed! Yet the two duo hasn't changed. If that isn't a reason to come to Montauk, Besides the Haystack fries and flavored mimosas, I don't know what is. Some servers in the past haven't been as inattentive and the few servers I enjoyed have moved on to bigger and better things. Being a Newyorker you get to know your favorite restaurants and best servers. So I'm finally writing a review, about my favorite sunday brunch spot! Yet it is on the pricey side, thats why we love going in big groups, buy lots of apps and the PUNCH BOWLS are everything. My close friend can only have certain food groups so they got her anything that would help with her diet! Im so grateful to feel a little at home here.   See ya next week for my birthday! like always walk in with four girls, leave with a huge group. thank you for being so accommodating and friendly. Cheers to another year!",

My daughter got the classic breakfast and she too loved her meal. Another in our group ordered the breakfast burrito. It was a breakfast burrito on steroids.  So huge and delicious. My other friend ordered the lobster roll. She said it was good. However, it was super small and for the price ($18 by itself) wouldn't order it again. Another friend in our group ordered the parfait. It looked awesome and it was good. Truly enjoyed our brunch and will be going back again soon!",

The facial expression she had throughout our visit looked as if she was smelling shit the entire time. She obv is superior to me in social status and treated us that way. Was also  slow to get me water and menu. I observed ppl come after me and get these items before me. Also watched the difference in how she treated them as to how she treated me. It was obvious I didn't peak her interest. I wanted to speak to a manager about this but when I  got one he smelled like weed, and I didn't even waste my time. It was pretty much a pre game for him as I saw him have a few drinks over the course of my visit. I won't return, nor will my colleagues.",

Bungalow was fun and fine for game day, but The Montauk is such an upgrade!   I've been here twice now--once for just drinks out on their back patio, and once for dinner on the front patio this past weekend. Our evening here was the perfect kickoff for my bachelorette party weekend!  It's the perfect mix of casual, breezy and fun. (The beach-house aesthetic is on point.) After waiting a few minutes for an outdoor table and grabbing some drinks, we perused the menu. I went with the chicken kabobs, which come with a kale salad and fries. The best of both worlds!! Last year I started eating meat after almost 11 years of vegetarianism, and seafood is one of the foods I still generally side-eye. I tried a bite of my friend's fish taco and it was DELICIOUS! I can see why people rave.   Our server was friendly and cute and after dinner my friends and I had an impromptu dance party in the bathroom. Success!",

Only complaint I have is that my server had a weird response when I asked if I could sub arugula in the grapefruit salad. He said \"ehhh you might be asking for too much there because arugula is more expensive than mixed greens\".... I've never heard of that before, but umm okay? I wasn't gonna say anything about how I thought it was a weird response, but my friends even brought it up how odd the conversation was after he left. I'm in the industry as well and I would have got an earful from my manager if he knew I told a customer that. It was pretty awkward, but I still love the place nonetheless.   I would have given this place 5 starts if it wasn't for that.",

The food was amazing, but the bartender was not very personable. At the bar well, there was plenty of drinks that could have been ran, but servers would just stand at the bar and look completely lost or as if they were incompetent of running other servers drinks. I saw Alyssa multiple times look at drink tickets, realize they were not hers and put the ticket back down and continue to stand there. I feel like my whole hour visit I watched her stand around at the bar doing nothing. Like I said, the food is amazing, but the service- not that great!",

We chose to sit at a booth and we're greeting by a very friendly waitress with casual \"Sunday brunch\" attire. I had never been before so I decided to go with the fish tacos and my friend went with the macaroni and cheese with hot dogs. First off I instantly loved the place because they had mac and cheese with hot dogs on the menu. It was nostalgic and was actually pretty good. The fish tacos were excellent and my recommendation would be to come hungry if you order these. They were 3 huge tacos that came with a nice amount of fries. The tacos were delicious and tasted very fresh and they even had a nice cucumber ranch that I requested with the fries that was a different take on regular ranch which was great. I would definitely go back to this place as there were many other menu options that grabbed my attention.",

The porch has such a lovely atmosphere, servers are knowledgeable and engaging and the drinks are inspired.  We loved how it had a great selection of wine, beer and cocktails.  My husband could get his hoppy beer while I enjoyed a glass of good wine or a cocktails, it was perfect.",

Let me start with I walked in, the music was bumpin', the place was packed, the bar was almost full & I was in an instant panic/dance-off!  Met w/ Joel at the door & he said, okay - we can seat you, but it might be tight.  Now, imagine my surprise as I find out later the manager is the guy helping push the tables together, grabbing stray chairs & trying to make my crew as comfortable as possible, IN MINUTES.  BEYOND AMAZING. Got seated in there cool lounge area only to find out, tight really means tight.  We were okay - but Joel wasn't having it.  Immediately found another solution, got a couple tables cleaned up, and boom - we were seated and sippin' champagne in no time. The servers were awesome, food was great (insert comment: You're a FOOL if you don't try the breakfast sandwich!!!!!) & my friends (out of towners & townies alike) were super happy.  Can't say it enough - thank you for giving us the PERFECT place to start our shenanigans this weekend :)",

We decided to stay anyway and the wait for our drinks took over 20 minutes. We decided to give this place another try so I organized a group of 6 people to join my husband and me for dinner. We waited over 30 minutes for our drinks and when I went to a staff employee to ask for my drink, I saw them sitting there. I said, \"we've been waiting for our drinks for over 30 minutes, could we please have them.\" She responds, \"I JUST poured them.\" She then proceeded to talk to her friends and let another 5 minutes pass. When I asked for a manager, guess who they pointed me to? That's right folks, the girl I had originally spoken to with the rude attitude. When our food arrived, the french dip was AWFUL! It was 90% fat and gristle. It was absolutely the worst french dip we have ever had. When I let the owner in on the mess, he bought me a drink. Nice thought, but he should have done more. We will never go back there. I give this place a year.",

Amazing flavors.  Second trip I had the Watermelon Mule...really refreshing, tasty and different.  The food both times was exceptional.  So far I've tried the ceviche (both times) - LOADED with shrimp, served in a coconut and the coconut flavor adds a great dimension to the dish.  The Tuna Tartare Guacamole was excellent.  The Grapefruit and Avocado Salad with Lobster is really delicious - highly recommend it.  The Lobster Wedge is also a beautifully-crafted plate.  Also tried the Green Curry Shrimp and substituted the brown rice with the Cauliflower fried rice - its not rice, its cauliflower shredded to simulate rice.  The dish was really flavorful.  I'll be heading back soon.  While the menu doesn't necessarily reflect the \"Hamptons Beach Cafe\" theme 100%, the design and casual vibe does in spades.  Having more indigenous food you get on Long Island would make this place that much more unique and appealing...and it would be easy to do.  There is a lot of great food found in these fun places out in the Hamptons.  Love it...",

It was busy when I went, hostesses were clueless - this seems so normal in Scottsdale I've kind of gotten used to it.  They required you to 'put your name in' and then you basically stand around while you look at available tables and wonder how long it is going to take before they 'authorize' you to be able to sit at one.  However, I did try to overlook this.  Then when seated, there was more confusion about who was waiting on the table.  Finally, someone came by and took drink and food orders. The drinks were great and very strong.  The food, did I order food??  I started to not be able to remember because of the drinks and because the FOOD NEVER CAME OUT.  After a LOT of patient waiting, we were informed the order was completely lost!!  So, the manager came out and said he was sorry - took care of the bill.  Very professional.  Because of that I would go back and check it out again - but I haven't yet...  :)",

    "text": "I never write reviews on here, but after my horrible experience at The Montauk, I felt compelled to share.  We were initially drawn to this place due to its cute decor and fun atmosphere. But after dining here, we learned it doesn't have much more than that.   We were initially quoted 30 minutes, but then were told by the hostess that they actually had a table getting ready for us. SIKE! They didn't so we ended up being quoted 30 minutes again. After ten minutes she got us sat. As we approached the table, it was sill being wiped down and wasn't set for us. Not a huge deal, I can usually overlook things like this.   Our server was quite a joy. Can't tell if she was new, super busy, or just actually terrible. She approached us and said she'd be right back with waters and that we were her only table so she could take excellent care of us! When she was ready to take our orders, we asked very simple questions about the menu because we were visiting from out of town and wanted to know what the best/most popular items were. She didn't seem to know much of anything about the menu. For example, when we asked what type of bread comes on one of the sandwiches, she pointed to the table beside us and said \"I think it's that kind of bread.\"  I had high expectations for the food as other yelpers raved about it, and a few friends recommended the place. We ordered the turkey and egg sandwich, the sweet corn scramble, and the honey jalapeno chicken sandwich. Unfortunately, we were very let down to say the least. All four of us were disappointed with everything we got, and honestly I can't even even say anything positive about any of the food.  The cherry on top of this awful experience was when we were ready to settle up the bill. We asked the server to split the bill in half, which we didn't think was a crazy request. She said sure and walked away. She then brings back the bills and after we politely told her it was incorrect, she walked away without saying a word. After more than 10 minutes waiting for the revised bill, we noticed the manager helping her at the POS. We decided to go and ask them if everything was alright and if they needed any clarification for how we asked to split the bill. The manager looks at the server and asks \"What table are they at?\". After pointing to our table, the server says \"we're taking care of it\". So with no help or acknowledgement from the manager whatsoever, we sat back down.   After about another 10 minutes of waiting, the server walks by and drops our checks on the table without saying a word, and walks away. Thanks!   This was probably the worst customer service I've ever experienced in a restaurant and that says A LOT. Everything from the scattered host, to the terrible food, the rude server, and the unconcerned manager, was awful.  As an individual who works in the food service industry, I 100% try to give people the benefit of the doubt when it comes to dining experiences. I get it, things happen, but this was just too bad to ignore.",

This past Friday I stoped in for HH and the experience started out great as usual- super friendly and helpful hostess who got us seated quickly. But our server and the service we were given once we sat down was below average. I was disappointed with how little attention we received throughout the night, especially after our appetizer arrived and we had to get up to ask our server for a side of sauce because she had not checked on us. I watched as she went from multiple tables and had yet to check on us/ bring over the sauce we had asked for. Only for us to reach out to another server for their help.  Once the night progressed our server became more attentive, but I had never experienced such poor service here before. I'm hoping next time I visit service will be back up to the standard I have witnessed on many other occasions.",

It's high season and they're busy. I live here, I get it. The two hostesses were the snarkiest, rudest, most unaccommodating people I have encountered in quite some time.  There are simply too many really solid choices within 200 yards of their front door. Life is too short to be a patron of a restaurant who treats \"customers\" this way. I went right up Stetson to The Herb Box where they were lovely and found a way to seat our party of 8.  They didn't martyr, they didn't roll their eyes.  The hosts at The Herb Box were lovely.  The food was great and so was the service.  The Herb Box is beautifully decorated and has gorgeous, cool restrooms, too.  The location is fabulous on top of everything else. Most importantly though; the people were kind. I'll go there first next time. And you know where I won't go again?  The Montauk.  Too many great choices for that nonsense.  Breakfast Club is a great choice, too.",

Awesome choice each side can feed about two people and still have room for the main course.  To give a little background I am fortunate enough to travel fairly regularly and dine and some great restaurants. When I saw the Wagyu on the menu I got excited, until I actually got it which left me a little disappointed. It was similar to a New York strip but for double the price! There was no overwhelming beefy flavour or the delectable fattiness which is to be expected with a good cut of wagyu.   As far as servers, it was great we had two waiters assisting and suggested some great bottles of wine for pair with our meals. Only issue we had which we did not realize until the next day is that we were double charged for one of the meals.   They were also kind enough to bring us out a surprise birthday plate for the birthday boy.  All and all the price for the quality of food was not there in my opinion. But great view from where we were sitting on the patio to see the sunset was amazing. I would definitely come back when I am in the area, but maybe try one of the domestic choices of meat.",

    "text": "Two of us went there for Saturday morning brunch. I'm giving it one star only because giving it negative stars is not an option. My guess is that the only reason this place stays in business is because of its location and unknowing tourists.  I love crepes and order them every chance I get. While the bacon, onion, havarti, egg combination sounded perfect on a cold, rainy day, the execution failed miserably. First, these are not crepes--they are tortillas, and not even good tortillas. They are pre-made, packaged, thick, stiff and flavorless. The onions were rancid and overwhelming. The bacon was soggy. The Havarti cheese never had a chance of melting because the other ingredients were stone cold. Thankfully, the \"crispy\" potatoes were edible, though there was nothing crispy about them--they were baby reds that had been sauteed with some oil.   And how hard is it to pull off a breakfast sandwich? It, too, was cold and the huge bun completely overwhelmed the inside ingredients. My friend will eat anything--it's the first time I've ever seen food left on his plate.   The service was timely, but the servers inexperienced, and after taking our ordered were never seen again. We had to ask a bus boy to get our check because we never saw our waitress again. We tipped her 20%, because we are generous and have been in the industry in the past ourselves, but a less understanding couple would have stiffed her.   Scottsdale has no shortage of good restaurants. This is not one of them. For brunch you would be better served going to the Breakfast Club or Starbucks next door.",

Drinks and food were pretty freakin good, nothing super memorable, but the entire restaurant was definitely memorable. Loved the decor; actually felt like being in The Hamptons or Montauk (in addition to Miami).   The best part though, was the DJ, namelessnoise. Everything he played was perfect. It was varied as well - some Spanish mixed in, down tempo, hip hop. I was obsessed.  Upon receipt of receipts, we got postcards, which was adorable since all of us were from out of town.  Note, this was also the perfect brunch spot for the bachelorette party I was attending. Perfect for day drinking.   If I lived in Scottsdale, I would be a frequent visitor!",

Today we came in for a late lunch (about 1:45) on a Tuesday afternoon. There was one server doubling as a hostess and a bartender. It took 30 minutes to get our drink order and at least another 10 to get lunch (we put our drink order and food order in at the same time) which is just ridiculous when there are only THREE other tables there, and all sat after us. The service that we did get from our server while she was talking to us was lacking, and as we exited we passed three other employees (where were they all this time? ) and not one person said goodbye. All around not the great experience we'd expect from nice place in Old Town Scottsdale. If this is the service you get, it's definitely not worth the money.",

My colleagues and I had just finished working a s***show event, and we needed a lengthy decompression. One of them suggested the Montauk, and this was just what we were looking for.  The place was pretty empty when we arrived, so we sat ourselves at the bar. Cocktails were flowing ASAP, and I rarely stay on the same train the whole night, but the old fashioneds were amazing. Bow down to this bartender for putting our nerves at ease.  For food, I was the first one to make my decision. We hadn't eaten in hours so the choice was easy. Burgers and cheese fries! I substituted the standard fries that come with the meal. This greasy yet tasty comfort food is exactly what I needed. The mac n cheese was fantastic as well.  Looking at pictures, the Montauk has a different vibe during the day. It has a fun and swanky vibe in the evening. Seems to have a bright and happy vibe during the day. I'd love to come here again. The decor and furniture are inviting, as are the bartenders. Thanks for a great experience!",

Small, but to be expected, but not a ton of flavor that comes with a fresh lobster roll.   Everything else echoes that sentiment. The Mac & cheese was soupy, the hummus was bland, as well as the tuna tartar guacamole. All items sound like they'll be legendary, but indeed ended up pretty tasteless.  The cauliflower fried rice fell into the completely bland category, as well. It sounded and looked delicious with a fried egg and piece of crispy bacon, but it had zero flavor or spice or taste.   Loved the vibe and aesthetic, but the food needed some sort of flavor, which with this lunch, there was none.",

Our team stopped by for lunch during a work visit and ordered a few appetizers:  Hummus Plate: I couldn't help myself. I'm a huge fan of hummus and Montauk's did not disappoint. The presentation was goregous with a serving of carrots, cucumbers, and warm toasted bread for dipping.  Poke Guac: I didn't try this since I'm not a fan of seafood, but the rest of our group practically licked the plate clean - I'll take that as two thumbs up.  Mac and Cheese: My least favorite of the appetizers. The pasta lacked taste and was served with way too much liquid.   For an entree I ordered the House Burger which came with fries (perfectly crispy, yum!), lettuce, tomato, and pickles. Pretty decent burger, but I could barely get down half after devouring the appetizers.   What shined at Montauk was their amazing interior and patio. This spot will have you reminiscing about your last vacation with adorable decor and a flamingo covered bathroom.",

It'd been a few years since I'd enjoyed a good lobster roll and all the vibes this adorable spot has to offer.   I downgraded my experience to a 4-star for the following reasons:  1) We ate out on the patio. If I was to revisit again I'd choose to eat indoors. There were a lot of flies and the chairs weren't the right height for the tables. But if you own a dog, the patio is very dog friendly.   2) Food items were hit or miss. Mac n cheese was a soupy mess, while the lobster roll was flavorful yet overpriced.  3) Service was solid and food came out quickly.",

    "text": "There's probably a little bit of Phoenix patio in November magic going on here, because taken as a whole I had a just fine experience here the other day. It was a gorgeous seventy-something degrees day and we dined on the aforementioned al fresco situation, and that's worth its weight in gold.   Food-wise we had some real hits and misses. I got the ahi poke salad and it was just what I wanted. I can't complain about it at all, and though no one I knows flies to Scottsdale to grab the ahi poke salad from The Montauk, if you're in the area and want a protein-rich salad then you're probably going to be pleased.  I was excited for a little taste of mac n' cheese and even though it looks like they use the cheese-not-roux method, something was way out of whack because it was more like a mac n' cheese soup than anything. Bummer because the taste could have been there.   The hummus was fine, I did dig on a few fries, and I saw the burger but didn't taste it--you do get your money's worth. The reports around the table were fine. And the fact that the table itself seemed too high (or the chairs too low, more likely) it made for a little awkwardness.  All that considered, though, it's a nice lunch option which leans towards the healthy at a more upscale pace so I'd be fine to find myself on a patio in the late fall again, thanks.",

It looks like a beach house, so we sat outside even though it was a little toasty. My boyfriend and I ordered the haystack fries, fried chicken sliders, and the Mac n cheese off the happy hour menu. The haystack fries were huge!!! I really enjoyed the buffalo sauce on the fries. I don't think I really enjoyed the blue cheese crumbles on top because they were too large to really eat with the fries. I would suggest a blue cheese sauce instead! The fried chicken sliders were so delicious - definitely my favorite HH item. The fried chicken was crispy and contrasted so well with the pickle and kale peanut slaw. The sriracha aoili added a little spice and creaminess as well. The Mac n cheese was also really good. It was extremely cheesy and the rotini noodles that they used were the perfect choice to gather as much cheesy goodness in the ridges. The flavor wasn't my favorite probably due to the type of cheeses used, but I still enjoyed the dish. I tried the watermelon mule for my beverage. The drink was very refreshing, but the ginger beer had such a strong flavor that it overpowered the subtle watermelon flavor. I tried a sip of my friend's drink, trade secret, and that would definitely be my recommendation if you want to try a specialty cocktail!",

It's definitely on the higher end of things everything from their clientele, location, their menu and of course their prices but that's ok it was a special day, my bday! The food combinations were new to me but YUMMY! Staff is young hipster type and the day we were there, they had a gal singing and playing her guitar which was pretty awesome! I love this place and I'm thinking of returning in Oct for my bday and 2nd Anniversary of moving to Az! Get those mimosas ready for me!!!",

We were seated out on the patio which was nice for people watching and enjoying the AZ cool breeze. Service out there was slow. Our server came over only a few times to take our order and to give us our bill.   The food was meh. I was hoping to be amazing like what others have mentioned but the flavor was lacking. Although my kids enjoyed their Mac n Cheese and plain fish tacos.",

One member of our party had the wrong burrito delivered 3 times. a simple request, no cheese, really three times! Even the food served correctly was marginal at best.  Then we ordered two crepes. They were basically dough that had not been grilled, baked, or whatever you do to a crepe to make it edible. How this was served is beyond me. The waitress, as she looked and saw we had not eaten them ,made no attempt to find out what the problem was. Of course just looking at them it was clear they were not made correctly. Never again. I am amazed anyone liked this restaurant. Our server had a bad attitude from the first time she came to the table. So many good places to eat, this is not one of them",

When we got to the table, the cloth bench was dirty (pieces of food), no big deal. I ordered a burrito with no bacon or avocado and a side of fruit. My husband ordered a burrito with no tomatoes and a side of potatoes...when the food arrived he got a burrito with no avocado and no tomatoes. I got a burrito with no tomatoes and bacon. I sent my order back, only to have the person bring back my plate and tell me they don't even put bacon in the burritos(mmm, ok-its listed on the menu and I can see it). Our waitress didn't come back for a while so I removed the bacon from my dish and ate it. Also, she gave me potatoes instead of fruit as a side. When I asked for fruit I was charged for an extra side.  From the street it looks cute. Food was average. Place could use a good cleaning. Service was complete and total garbage. I had a feeling the waitress would mess up the order when she didn't write anything down after we told her what we wanted. Wouldn't return or recommend.",

Finally, we have another person join our party and got a round of drinks. Good lord we couldn't hear anything because the music was so loud. We decided to resolve the issue by taking a booth spot in the corner, and were assigned the server named Michael.   He completely turned around our experience by being overly attentive on our drink orders, appetizers and a friendly person to converse.   We will be back for Michael, but they have to lower the music for sure! It was hard for my dad with hearing issues to keep a conversation with me.",

My favorites are the burrata, fish tacos, lobster roll and kale salad.  It's more of a loungey place with great music so if you're looking for a quiet dinner this might not be the best idea.

My only complaint would be that the upstair lounge tables are a bit low if you're eating a full dinner but there's plenty of booths for that.",

Other than that would definitely go back for the food again and to enjoy the vibe. As a New Yorker, this really brought out the feel of Montauk.",

The tequila shrimp bowl was also very tasty. But my absolute favorite are the Brussels sprout tacos. I can not believe how tasty they are  a great spot and I will continue to come.

However can't complain too much because it was delicious, it just makes you want more :) They had a live DJ which was pretty cool. The decor was very beach scene and laid back. They have a beautiful patio with lots of space and sitting areas. I thought this place was a cute gem that was tucked away. It is definitely a must if you go to Scottsdale. You will not regret it.

We really enjoyed their food and when we were looking for a lunch place, I knew we had to go again! As expected, the food was FLAVORFUL and FRESH!   They DON'T offer a GLUTEN-FREE MENU, but they have items that are gluten-free which our waitress was able to talk to me about. THREE bowls off the menu are gluten-free: cauliflower \"fried rice\", tequila lime shrimp, and basic balsamic chicken. I decided to go with the shrimp while my boyfriend got the honey-chicken sandwich.  I LOVED that the ingredients were all placed separately in the bowl rather than all mixed it. I was able to pick out some of my favorite vegetables and mix it how I liked. There was a sweet sauce underneath it that really added BODY and FLAVOR to the dish! The sandwich looked more like a hamburger when it came out. It was VERY rich in SEASONINGS with a thin sauce adding zest!   The shrimp in my bowl really added that necessary taste since it was heavily seasoned. It also tasted very fresh, along with the other vegetables. The chips that came with the sandwich were crisp and not super greasy too! Overall, the QUALITY in the food was there and I was very IMPRESSED by the different flavors and textures that elevated each dish.",

The sandwich cake with large chunks of lobster meat, which can make for a messy albeit tasty meal.

It is physically a very pretty restaurant with a Hamptons-esque, beachy vibe.   The food menu is pretty limited, but is innovative and well-executed, and the alcohol menu is extensive, offering an impressive wine and cocktails list, craft beers, and fun \"punch bowls\" of several cocktails intended for groups. We tried the prime rib sandwich and the chicken crepe from the brunch menu. They were both excellent and unique items you don't see on typical menus. We also got a round= each of bloody mary's and Spark Plug cocktails, which are cold brew coffee-based with Bailey's and a coffee ice cube. Yum!  Service started off great but got inexplicably slow and they weren't particularly busy. Not a huge deal on a lazy Sunday morning, just a minor annoyance.  Live music on weekends, and when we were there (Sunday brunch), Phoenix local Sydney Sprague was playing. She is phenomenal and worth the follow on social media! The Montauk also has a dog friendly patio. Consider this place next time you're in Old Town, you won't  be disappointed!",

    "text": "Good food, weird atmosphere   Came here Sunday for brunch, prepared to wait. There were 4 of us and we were told 30 minutes. After 45-50 our table was ready. The place is LOUD. I want to preface by saying I'm not \"old\". If I go out to eat with friends, however, I would like to be able to have a conversation without screaming. Again, there were only 4 of us so it's not like we were sitting far away from each other at a giant table. I guess it is filled with brunch goers still trying to continue their partying from the night before. It's loud because of a combination of customers talking loudly but there is also live music. It was a man with an acoustic guitar. He was very good but again it was LOUD. After he finished playing there was a 30 minute \"break\" from music and then a DJ showed up. The DJ was of course louder than the acoustic guitar. Thankfully it was towards the end of our meal, we just had to cut the conversation short to get out to relieve our ears. Okay noise rant over.  The food was good! The sweet corn scramble was unlike anything I've tried before. I loved it! And the potatoes- WOW! I'd go back just to eat the potatoes. The should make a breakfast \"nachos\" with those as the base. Super tasty. The grilled bread that comes with it is strange though. I think they're trying to be different instead of offering toast but it was hard as a rock and didn't come with anything on it. Not butter or jam so it was pretty pointless. Better off without it. My friend got the grilled chicken crepe which was also very good. Unlike anything I've had before. The sweet crepes sounded (and looked) delicious. I'd definitely try one if I ever go back.   I think next time I'd try to go earlier or later and sit outside. Or maybe I need to be drunk when I get there so I can hang with the party atmosphere.",

We were there for over 2 hours and were never offered more than one drink during brunch. The burrito was underwhelming and the kale salad was very lime-y. The deviled eggs were decent, but not my favorite. Apparently the blood Mary was delicious, but the sandwich, burger, and sweet corn casserole was not impressive to any of the people in my party.",

We started with the tuna tartare guacamole and the combo really just set the mood for the meal moving forward. Super flavorful with every bite. It was served with wonton chips that also seemed as if they were homemade (can't beat that!). Four of us shared it and it was enough to fill us up before our meal came.   Right when we walked in, a server was bringing an entire platter full of burgers to a table so obviously it caught my eye. How could I not order a burger? I kept it simple with the house burger but instead of mayo, I opted in for the chipotle aioli, which you can never go wrong with. It added even more deliciousness to the burger! Yummmmm!",

We ordered warm Lobster rolls. I thought the flavor to be a bit 'gamey' (fishy). I think I would select the cold roll next time to hopefully avoid this. The toasted lobster roll came with choice of side,....kale salad. I'm not a salad guy, but the kale salad was the star of the show, the dressing was solid, with currants/raisins  nuts and other filler that I can't recall. It left me wanting more. The total experience was good I'd give it 84/100. I'll return at during HH or with a discount only.",

    "text": "A little slice of Long Island in Arizona -- I dig it! The decor is very nautical chic and really made me feel like I could have been out in Montauk.   On a Friday night at prime dinner time it wasn't hard to get a table. We were able to snag a seat outdoors with zero wait. To put things into perspective, the wait next door at Diego Pops was over an hour.  The menu isn't huge, but luckily there are some staples that you can't go wrong with. Two of us split burrata, guacamole topped with tuna, fish tacos and a side of mac and cheese.   Burrata was definitely the highlight of the meal (as it usually is for me). The portion was large and came topped with fresh fig spread and prosciutto. I'm not the biggest fan of guacamole or raw tuna but my hubs finished every last drop. So if you like these things you should probably order this. Fish tacos are another must - the order comes with two plump tacos and the fried fish is topped with the most delicious aioli. The side of mac wasn't too memorable and tasted reminiscent of something that you'd find at KFC. I just get sold when I see gouda in the description... who can blame me?   Bonus points for a fantastic rose sangria and wonderful service. There is a wraparound porch with lots of seating and the cutest lighting, so I'd suggest trying to sit outside if you can. They also had lots of large tables which would make this perfect for a group dinner.",

This place was super packed with an event that was being held -which as a member of the food industry myself, I can completely understand service can be slightly slower than normal at times and I respectfully leave room for error- However we were not greeted by anyone when we sat at the bar, our first order was incorrect, the bartender was unwilling to bring us bleu cheese olives when they were ordered for a vodka martini, saying that the kitchen was \"too backed up\", and on top of that we were brought an outdated tab. So when we closed out and received our cards back we were shocked to see we had been charged an extra 20 dollars with out a word.  It's one thing when mistakes occur, but it's another when you are treated poorly in an environment you expect the opposite.  I am rating two stars because I have been here twice before and had a pleasant experience both times. Sad. This however, deserved a review. I won't be back again.",

Don't hesitate to get two orders.",

Expect it to take 45 minutes to get a bottle of champagne when it's half empty, get raw eggs, pay 9 dollars for a slice of bread and have the manager come by to address our concerns to only walk away without commenting on anything except saying I'll be right back.... and never returned. Glad to know service exists. Thx Christina(server)and Morgan (manager). It was nice to watch you run your mouth from the corner immediately after stopping at our table. Christina was training another new server, and with a two person team they still could not manage to stop by and check on our empty drinks and untouched food. Awful.",

My boyfriend & I split the burrata and deviled eggs appetizers -- total being $17, not bad.

They are also giving you less food than they used to. I live walking distance to this restaurant so it used to be my go-to, but the service had been consistently horrible for the past few months.

I have worked in customer service for a long time and service specifically, I have never had someone offer so little explanation for a price discrepancy and then tell me to pay for their mistake. I went from ordering one of the more moderately priced glasses on the menu to buying the the most expensive, the highest priced glass on the physical menu was $14.

    "text": "My husband and I went here for lunch on a Thursday afternoon. The patio was full (a handful of tables) but otherwise the place was dead. We sat at the bar, because that's what we do, and we had to wait 15 minutes before someone ever brought us a menu. Once we finally got the menu and knew what we wanted it took another 10-15 minutes or so before anyone ever came around to take our order. We ordered a few over-priced cocktails. I was happy with mine (the Rose Sangria) but my husband was very disappointed with the presentation and taste of his. It was definitely not worth the 10 bucks... next we tried an appetizer... $13 later... the ahi tuna tartare guacamole wasn't so much \"guacamole\" as it was just plain mashed avocado. Which, so what? I like avocado! It was ok, the wonton chips were good. And they did serve a generous portion of the tuna tartare. Then we ordered our meal. (Again after waiting an overwhelming amount of time to be paid attention to..) he ordered the \"famous\" lobster roll and I ordered fish tacos and upgraded my side to the crispy Brussels sprouts (def. the best thing we ordered) the \"shoestring\" fries were closer to day-old McDonald's fries than actual shoestring fries. They were stale and cold. (Womp-womp) the Lobster roll was tiny for the $20 we spent on it. And the fish tacos were bland. The fish itself was good, but the slaw that topped it was undressed and flavorless. I had to douse it with lime to make it less dry.  All in all, we spent almost $100 on LUNCH and didn't even have stellar service to make up for the less than decent dishes. We were really disappointed because we'd had high expectations. Unfortunately, we won't be going back... I'm so sad to say.",

    "text": "Stopped in here for a quick lunch and a cocktail with my wife.  The wife ordered the Avocado and Pink Grapefruit Salad with a Trade Secret.  She loved every bite of the salad and every sip of her drink.  She liked the salad because it wasn't overly sweet, there was a nice balance.  I ordered the Wedge without lobster and a Spark Plug.  The Wedge was what you would expect, bacon, bleu cheese, tomatoes, but they also add summer squash and cucumbers.  These additions added a very nice variation to the standard wedge.  The Spark Plug is a bit strong in the beginning, but if you allow the coffee ice cube to melt a bit, it becomes extremely smooth cold brew coffee with creamer.  Together, we shared the coconut lemongrass ceviche.  I am known for getting ceviche whenever and wherever I can.  I can honestly say, this is one of the best ceviches I have had in the world. There is a nice sweetness to balance out the salty.  I will warn you though, there are fresh jalapenos, which will provide a kick, but this kick is balanced out very well with the sweet and salty.  The only issue we had was when our waitress brought my wife the wrong drink.  The waitress entered a watermelon mule instead of the Trade Secret.  My wife tried one sip of the mule and did not like it, but recognized it as having none of the properties the Trade Secret was said to have.  When the waitress was made aware, she quickly apologized and bright the correct drink within a few minutes.  Overall, the food was amazing, the service was good, but very responsive to questions and mistakes, and the atmosphere was good, but a little worn.",

Im used to walking in and being greeted. \"Welcome to Montauk,\" nope, just \"how many?\" Kinda starting to get that vibe the more I come to Scottsdale.  She left to go clean off a table, and another hostess approached. No smile, eye contact, or nothin Jesus! After hostess #1 returned from cleaning the table she told hostess #2 \"its done.\" We were then walked to the table, our menus were placed on the table and off she walked.   The waitress came and didnt say \"hello\" either. What the fuck? These girls here really need some training on hospitality and possibly manners. We asked for water to start, took about 5 mins to get that. THEN we ordered drinks from the bar, took 10 mins to come back with that. We left. You can keep your drinks and your shitty service.   Ill give you 1star because I like the way the decor looks in here.",

The hostess seemed to be all over the place and took forever just to seat anyone, so we sat at the bar.  The drinks were good and reasonably priced,  but the service was sub par and the food took forever-we're talking 40 minutes for a breakfast burrito and crepes. When the food came out it was good, but they forgot one of the sides and utensils.   The guy sitting next to me was waiting for a hamburger for over 30 minutes and had to leave without his food because it took so long. If I was on a time constraint, they'd be getting less stars. I will try it again, but they really need to improve their service or it won't make it very long.",

My husband ordered the fish and chips, and commented that they were just okay. He thought he fries that came with it tasted like they were cooked earlier that day. My mother in law didn't comment on her ceasar salad, but it looked delicious to me. I may order that next time.  I'll definitely give it a second chance.",

I had the lobster roll - warm which was great. Good amount of lobster and the roll was really good too. It came with a kale salad. The kale salad was pretty good and i like the lemon vinaigrette and the stuff they put in it. Much better than the lame side salads at most places   Dessert : nutella + banana crepe : too much banana and not enough nutella - it was Okay. Definately ask for extra nutella  All in all a cool place to check out.",

    "text": "GOOD FOOD, GOOD VALUE, BUMPIN' SCENE...Bartending less so.  I try not to write reviews on single visits to be balanced and fair.  Last night was my fifth visit and I just can't get this place over 3 stars, average.  The GOOD:  food is reasonably priced and the menu and decor definitely reminds me of Montauk (small part of Long Island, a.k.a. The Hampdens where Manhattanites flee the summer heat).  The FISH TACOS have very clean flavor and very fresh fish but simply do not meet \"cravable\" status like Coconuts.  I think this because the slaw they are using is standard fare with no unique style.  The kitchen is great at adjusting to requests so maybe they will turn it up.  Other reviewers are chatting up the CAULIFLOWER FRIED RICE.  I agree, this is pleasantly flavorful.  I recommend getting it with lobster chunks as the dish is already slightly dry on the palate and white meat chicken enhances that negative.  A touch of an infused olive oil tossed in at the end would go a long way toward improving this one but still kudos for the creativity.  The LOBSTER ROLL (HOT) is a hit.  There is a place in Manhattan, called Mary's Fish Camp, that gets all kinds of positive press.  This dish could seamlessly jump on the menu and hold its own.  On one occasion (last night) the service was particularly chaotic and completely malfunctioned when a bachelorette party landed with their dick straws and selfie sticks.  The Manager came over after we had a series of post-meal drink misfires and chopped our $300 bill in half.  I would have settled for a round on the house but the Manager is clearly tuned for keeping this place in a good light.  I don't know if he recognized us as returning customers or this is his policy but that level of Manager awareness and remedy is very commendable.  Circling back to the scene, there is a solidly fun vibe to this beach house-style decor.  The DJ seems to never stop and plays a great spread of tracks. The upper deck couches are fun and comfortable and the table booths are equally set up to enjoy dinner while still being inside the buzz.  I would kick this whole review up a star if the house would grasp the concept that even Friday's understands...as the crowd grows, the music should NOT.  At risk of echoing the comments of other reviewers and sounding twenty years older, the scene is best early, ahead of the place reaching 50% capacity.   Look, we all like to feel the thump of base in our chests and rhythm in our feet but not at the expense of yelling at the persons we came with standing the length of a soda straw away.  I could get the same effect and a lower bar bill by just hanging at the bar, putting my friends on FaceTime then asking them to hit mute on their end.  THE MEDIOCRE:  Service is organizationally novice but the staff is incredibly upbeat and friendly, clearly trying with great intent.  Super friendly, just unskilled.  Plus, there are a number of menu misses.  Every version of their French fries are unimpressive.  Not bad per say, just unimaginative.  Buffalo-style anything is a nod to drunk frat boys blowing their money for the night on over priced drinks but realizing they gotta eat.  And putting that same Franks Red Hot sauce on potato chips is equally a miss.  The Mac-and-Cheese falls short of getting any attention.  In fact I had to rebook at the bill to even remember we ordered it.  THE BAD:  I have already crossed the noise level discussion.  The drinks are weak and even for Old Town, priced too high.  If you are going to charge $15 for Hendrick's , St. Germaine and soda then make it in a clean glass, make it constantly each time I order it consecutively and actually use Hendrick's.  These bartenders are routinely scrambling and I imagine they are getting very lucky that most guests are ordering drinks they only have to cork and pour, not mix.  I would only add, get rid of the bathroom attendant. It a relic concept that is simply creepy weird.",

Decor is very tasteful, but that's where it ends- server hadn't been trained for the price point, and it showed- she was more suited for a Chili's.  Slammed our glasses down on the table with every delivery, and no napkins.  Shrimp ceviche was really just a plate of chopped shrimp- no vinegar, no tomatoes, no cucumbers, no lemongrass, no coconut, no flavor.  Cauliflower fried rice was just ok- oddly sweet, but bitter.  Lastly, very LOUD- most of the patrons had just returned from a pool party, and were there to party- Dos Gringos II, if you ask me.",

The kale was not wilted enough and was extremely difficult to chew. The chicken, on the other hand, was almost as if it had been boiled and was kind of limp and tasteless. I am giving them 3 stars because the place was packed and there were many apparently happy customers. I will have to go back and give the food a second try.",

Not only is the food amazing, but the workers/service is on point. Callie the bartender makes the best Spark Plugs, only order them from her. You should always request to sit in Kardi's section if you want impeccable service. Joel the manager is probably the coolest dude ever.

This joint is right on the corner of Scottsdale & Stetson/Drinkwater so site-seeing is a big part of the sell here. High rent for sure.   I've had the Lobster Roll once. It's served cold, and feels like it should be warm - I'm sure you could order it warm if you want. My go-to, here, is the Prime Rib French Dip Sandwich. A-Mazing. I really can't order anything else or speak on anything else in fact. I'll continue to go back just for this sandwich, and contend that it's the best French Dip around.   The \"talent' traveling a-foot around Old Town goes by (and in) The Montauk, and having a mouth full of prime rib french dip while spectating is a beautiful thing.",

Got there at 6:15 for a 6:30 reservation and was greeted with a \" Well, you're early.\"  Seriously?  Nothing was ready for a party of TWENTY. It was pouring rain  and I told them we needed to be seated inside, as per my conversation with Morgan two days before the party.  Nope. \" We're booked inside. You get the patio.  That's what the reservation book says.\" They scrambled to wipe off tables and chairs and get the heaters started. We finally got seated outside and it started to pour. The roof was leaking, the heaters were dropping burning hot water on people, and the rain was blowing into the patio area. After another conversation with the grumpy jerk of a manager, we got moved inside.  The manager on duty that night was rude and argumentative.  He asked us when we were leaving so he could seat someone else at our tables!  He said \" Your reservation was for the patio until 10:30, not the inside.\" What a jerk. He glared at us until we finally all cashed out and left.  It was a birthday party and it should have been noted in the reservation. It wasn't.  We weren't even offered dessert. Not even for the birthday guest.  Food was good. Waitresses were mediocre.  I had to ask for my change after she left with my cash and never returned. Needless to say, we'll never go back.",

We ordered some drinks to start and I must say that they do have a great drink menu.  The setup inside is almost the exact same setup that Bungalow had when they had the establishment.  I would have thought for a new place to open they would at least change up the look and feel of the place.  Not a big deal.  We put our name down for 4 with the hostess and she said it would be 20 minutes.  We walked in to the bar and noticed there were at least 4 open tables, but didn't pay any attention to it.  After about 20 minutes waiting at the bar I asked the hostess to give me an ETA and she said we were up next.  Still seeing the same 4 tables empty I thought hmm ok.  I walked back to the bar and the hostess walked up and said they had  table ready outside.  I said ok, but what about this one as I pointed to a booth right across from the bar.  She said ok you can sit there.    Ordered the breakfast sandwich and deviled eggs.  Both great selections and they did not disappoint the taste buds.  Our waitress was on point and she didn't ignore us at all throughout our meal.  I don't think I'll be back here unless I find myself meeting friends.",

Everything tasted great! All of the ingredients were good so that was a big win right there. The scallops are quite small but were cooked very well.  The only bad thing is that it was quite loud and we happened to get sat at the coldest booth in the house apparently. It was freezing in the corner! I'm glad I brought my jacket!   The wait staff was very good. Pleasant but not too much and not too stand offish.    I liked the nautical decor, food, and quality. I'd return to try the fish tacos and burgers but probably on a day time visit. The prices didn't seem unreasonable for the area and quality (we saw the actual menu but didn't order from it).

Sat at the bar, The one bartender only had 1 gear and was not fast at all, the both did not know how to pour, or shake a drink to save their life, and would not know what the meaning of costumer service was if they were looking at the definition in the dictionary.  Waited over 20 min just to get a drink and another 15 for them to take our order, we should have just left.",

Casual environment, sports on TVs, staff and service was excellent; I enjoy seeing smiling staff :-) I enjoyed seeing the comfy booths, although I and my fiancee had a table.  I ordered the salmon -- orange teriyaki sauce made it great.  Fiancee ordered lobster sandwich -- also a quite scrumptious choice!",

I had a yummy coffee drink (forgot the name. Oops) and a mimosa type cocktail with orange vodka, ginger ale and a splash of sparkling wine. It was really chilly with the cross breeze from the open windows so my bartender, gosh I'm really bad at this because I left the receipt and forgot her name (this was 30 minutes ago so she's here now). I had the warm lobster roll which was quite yummy with the house salad. I feel like it had too much sauce and didn't need the butter or lemon because of that. The roll was kind of small and the lettuce leaf, huge, so I ate it with a fork and knife. Overall it was really good. It just didn't need so much stuff for me to enjoy the lobster. Service was great. She was really helpful to another guy visiting from out of town which is how I found about my second drink. It's not on the menu anymore. I would recommend and go back.",

I visited this place for dinner with a few friends.I had been told the place wasn't very good, but I wanted to see for myself while I was in town.   Service overall was fine. Nothing negative to say, but nothing that wow'd me. Polite hostess, server greeted us fairly quickly, took our drink/food orders and you he's our table a fair amount of times.   Deviled eggs with bacon jam, yum! These were memorable. I also had a chicken cesear salad which was a very generous size.   They had a DJ playing that night and all I can say was great music, not so great sound system. Kind of sounded like one of the speakers was blown.   Not sure if I'll be back but who knows, maybe it was just an off visit.",

From time to time the waitress mix up/ or forget our drinks (but it was a large party) The menu was simple and to the point, their Mac N Cheese is absolutely amazinggg, along with the Shrimp appetizer. So delicious, and the waitress recommended a grapefruit type of drink that was perfect. The only thing I'd complain about is the Menu, because dessert wasn't anywhere to be found, I had to ask the waitress. Wish there was at least a separate menu with the choices available. Great place to go with friends for a decent priced bite to each and drink.",

I could go on and on about how awesome it is.  During the week, if you work in the area, it's also a great place for a quick, affordable, delicious lunch. Parking can be a little bit difficult in the area since it's old town, so if you can walk, I'd recommend that especially during busy hours.  Overall, it's got great decor, it makes you feel like you're in the Hamptons or something. Great place, great food, great staff. I'll miss you guys. I'll make sure to stop by when I visit!",

So many cute spots to take trendy photos and they have a fun little wall in the back you can take pictures in front of.  That being said, a restaurant isn't just about what kind of photos you can take there...  We went for brunch on a Saturday and it was steady but not packed. We were quoted a 30-40 minute wait which was fine and we actually only waited like 20-30... So that was good!  The Deviled Eggs were so good!!!!! I think they were my favorite part of the meal. The crispy bacon on top is delish.  I got the Cold Lobster Roll with Fries and honestly, for $20, I just wasn't super impressed. I mean, it wasn't BAD but it wasn't phenomenal. The bun they used was the best part. I've had better lobster rolls from other restaurants. The fries were horrible. Like cold, hard and almost inedible and I think I ate one or two and then stopped. Ketchup could not save them.  Hubby got the Breakfast Burrito with Ribeye and he said it was okay. Needed some kind of sauce in it to pull it all together. The french fries inside it made everything dry and the guacamole that was supposed to be in there was kind of non-existent. He also said the \"crispy new potatoes\" were meh.  The service was also awful. Possibly the worst waitress I've ever had? She just had such a bad attitude and made us feel as though we were bothering her....... Girl. You're a waitress.... You wait on people as your job..... She seemed so annoyed just doing basic server duties like taking our order and refilling our drinks. Definitely not customer service that makes me want to come back and try again.",

The service was non-attentive and slow and the food was mediocre at best. Salmon devil eggs lacked flavor. Breakfast sandwich egg was overlooked the potatoes where cold and the bun was coated in butter and soggy. The crepes looked like a pile of raw dough. I wouldn't even try them. My friend ate them because he was starving and didn't want to wait another 40 minutes for food. They better revamp soon or it will be a goner in less than 6 months.",

    "text": "We were walking past here and attacted to the open air floor plan.  That said there was no signage of any kind yet since it just opened. I guess they may have opened a little earlier than anticipated to take advantage of the high volume of Superbowl visitors in Old Town.  That said, for a brand new restaurant in their first week of operation I was overall pretty happy.   A few notes:  1) we asked about happy hour as we'd seen prominent displays of Happy Hours for other local restaurants.  The guy we asked (who was busy rearranging chairs so they'd match the right tables) said they haven't started yet and wouldn't because it was Superbowl week and people are going to buy drinks anyway.  He said no one is going to do Happy Hour this week (yet, this place was not even close to being full, so it didn't make a lot of sense to me ... aren't happy hours to drive people in?  Plus other places definitely had Happy Hours).  So if you're expecting a happy hour special call them first to make sure they have it.  It wasn't why we stopped by so it wasn't a big deal to us. 2) our waitress was pretty attentive and all our food came to our table quickly and exactly as expected from the menu descriptions.  No complaints on that.  Great service overall 3)  I wasn't crazy with the tartness of the \"Token Kale Salad\" ... it was okay, but no where near the best Kale Salad I've had.  I think token describes it. They wanted a Kale Salad on the menu, but they're no where near perfecting the recipe.   4)  They need some healtiher fried options.  All the options seemed either friend or loaded with butter.  Even the sweet corn side I ordered to have with my salad was loaded in butter (it was super tasty, but totally loaded in butter).  Overall we decided to give this place a try as we wanted to eat outside and enjoy the gorgeous weather (since we're from the northeast and going back tomorrow).  Would I go back here?  Maybe, but honestly I'd probably try other local restaurants first or go back to the Original Chop Shop which offers more healthy options and is a lot more vegetarian friendly.  I didnt have many vegetarian options on the Montauk's menu.",

We ate there last night and I was thrilled that it was not just another Old Town bar with perfunctory food thrown in. While there is no doubt that beverages are highlighted, the tuna tartare guac and ceviche were very tasty as were the fish tacos. I tried the lobster wedge, and will likely try something different next time. It is difficult to get terrific lobster at a reasonable price point. I'm intrigued by some of the sandwiches that I saw and will check those out next time out.  Michelle is a great server and made the experience one that will be repeated. Tai, as always, is customer driven and a pleasure. He is dedicated to making things right and The Montauk is a better place because of him. We will be back!  Dr. B",

Loved the atmosphere of the restaurant.. it had a laidback, but still upscale vibe. The food was delicious (loved the cauliflower fried rice), and the service was exceptional. Our waiter, Morgan, really solidified my positive review. I will definitely be back when I am in Scottsdale.",

    "text": "I loved this place. I had never been to the bungalow so can't compare lookswise but being a new yorker, this place is amazing and really reminds me of bars/ restaurants on the east end of Long Island. All that's missing is the sand and ocean! I highly recommend the fish tacos, they were delicious. The only reason this is not a 5 star for me is the drinks are really expensive. I think the cocktail I ordered, while delicious was something like $14 dollars and the glass wasn't even filled to the top. It had an enormous square ice cube in it too, which while cool looking- it didn't leave a lot of surface area for the glass to be filled with alcohol- which is what you want for $14 a glass. For that reason, I only ordered one drink, and am hesitant to make this a place for regular visits. They also need to figure out their happy hour and didn't have any desserts available, although there were some listed on the menu.   I think they still have a bit more growing to do so I'll give them a month or so and try it again, but I'm definitely a fan and loved the ambiance both indoors and on the patio!",

Started with a the rose sangria. Basically it was a glass of ice, with rose and a couple berries in the bottom. Disappointing. For food we order the the house made chips, prime rib sandwich, clam chowder and lobster roll. The chips were good but we added Cholula hot sauce and they were way better. Clam chowder tasted like it came from a can. Prime rib sandwich was super fatty with a soggy bun. And the lobster roll was decent, but was a lot of bun with a little lobster. The service was beyond slow. We were there or just under 2 hours for just dinner alone. Our waitress was very nice, but just slow.",

This location would've been great if we were just having drinks, but it was really awkward and uncomfortable for eating dinner. I understand that we had a gigantic group however, so that may have been the only space we fit. The air conditioning was broken in our space and we had to request that it be looked into several times. Eating seafood in muggy stagnant atmosphere is not the most enjoyable experience. The food was pretty good, but really overpriced, even for old town. I would go back again for cocktails but it was not a great experience with a large party.",

I ordered the Endless Summer from their specialty cocktail list {Rose | Veev Acai | muddled strawberry & orange peel} and it is the perfect refreshing spring cocktail.

And frankly, that's kind of the feeling you get when dining here, despite the fact that you're in downtown Scottsdale. The open-air feel, cool color palate, and fast-casual attitude prop this all up.   We stopped in for lunch in a large group, and I got to sample the cauliflower fried rice with lobster for my meal. It's a tasty, creative take on fried rice, with that classic American-Chinese fried rice flavor. And low carb! Woot! The lobster was an add-on, and they definitely were not shy with the meat. The lobster roll looks tasty as well.   Service was on point, and while the food did take quite a while to come out, I'm imagining that it was my group of 7's large order that made it so. Otherwise it was a solid experience and I'd definitely return.",

I was in town for work meetings and we came here. If you're looking for a quick thirty minute lunch, this might not be the most ideal place to go. Kudos to the team at Montauk for getting a group of at least 8 people in and out in about an hour! So many things on the menu caught my eye, but I'm a salad for lunch type...I just can't help it! I ordered the avocado and pink grapefruit salad and added shrimp. It's served with mixed greens, jalapeno, feta, pumpkin seeds with a vinaigrette. It was the perfect entree salad- delicious and nutritious! Others dishes ordered in our group were the lobster roll, truffle fries, tuna tartare guacamole and cauliflower flower fried rice. The minute we walked in, I swept away to Montauk and I'd definitely return for a more leisurely meal.",

I've been about 5 times in the last 2 months, trying happy hour, dinner, brunch, and casual drinks hoping that the last time was just a fluke and the service will be better but I have yet to be even slightly impressed with the service.   Today was my breaking point. I went in for my birthday brunch and after being told it would be a 45 minute wait (although the no wait app claimed 15 minute wait) I was sat 10 minutes after putting my name in; COOL THINGS SHOULD BE GOOD RIGHT THAT WAS A QUICK WAIT?  WRONG.   My party sat, and waited 15 minutes before being greeted by a server and brought water (pretty typical wait to be greeted for them.) The server offered no introduction \"what can I get you to drink\" was the first words to come out of his mouth. We put in our drink orders and I set my timer to see how long it would take for them to out. 35 minutes later, still no drinks. We talked with 2 other tables who were clearly just as annoyed with the service. We watched the server carry a small tray of drinks and sit it on 2 different tables (something anyone who's ever worked in the industry knows is common sense not to do.) and thats when I made the executive decision to go elsewhere, because it would have easily been another hour before I would have gotten food.  If this was the only time its happened I would be understanding but when 4 of my friends have been on separate occasions and had the same issues (wait times/food wrong/people getting their food 5 minutes after everyone else with no explaination where their food is) thats when you know somethings wrong.  WHAT TO COME HERE FOR: Happy hour/drinks but sit at the bar, because at least then you can get a drink in a timely manner.   I REALLY want to like this place but I won't be coming again unless I plan 3 hours for a meal.",

We came across Montauk okay amazing outside the weather is great and they said there was a wait to be seated 30 mins and 45 for food we said that's fine! We were hungry and wanted to try this place out!  We didn't wait for the complete time which was greatness! Sat down, and a rude waitress took our drink orders and then when we saw it was more reasonable to get a bottle she said I'm not taking care of your table anymore someone else will be coming! It took about 10 mins before the other nice waitress come with the bottle of champagne! We needed some juices! They have a couple of options of juices for mixing! However what we asked for they didn't have! Epic fail! I was already irritated we are spending money and the service wasn't great! And I was feeling kinda discrimination coming our way since we were the only two dark skinned women in the whole restaurant! And I hate that feeling since we are spending the same amount of money as others!  We asked to switch tables since the place kinda cleared up and wanted to sit and enjoy the weather then the hostess comes and tells us it's been reserved which is a bunch of nonsense it wasn't they gave it to a couple that just walked up and asked for it!  Ordered brunch! Egg white scrambled but was mediocre!  We were barley done with the food the lady comes asking if we are thru and we still have our folks in hand! And cleaning up our table trying to rush us! I am soo irritated!  This is my first and last time dining here and will spread the word",

    "text": "We tried the Montauk last night and were immediately drawn to the outdoor seating. The hostess was very nice and quickly checked for an open table and came back to seat us with a smile. We waited more than 5 minutes for a server to greet us and I might add that it didn't appear to be busy at this time. Once Ariana came by she was very nice. We ordered a couple drinks after asking her about some favorites. Drinks took quite a few minutes but while we waited a manager came by to light the candle on the table. At least I think it was a mgr. He didn't even acknowledge we were there.  Once we got our drinks we ordered dinner. We decided to share the prime rib sandwich and the lobster wedge. Then we waited....and waited...about 25 minutes later food was delivered. At that time we ordered another round of drinks. The food was amazing. Prime rib was lean and tender and the creamy horseradish set it off. Lobster wedge, phenomenal. I will say from a food cost standpoint it didn't need so much of the blue cheese crumbles. I like a lot of cheese but there was plenty left on the plate after the salad was finished. We finished our dinner before the second round of drinks was delivered which was a really long time as we were visiting and taking our time. Ariana actually cleared our plates and apologized and said they'd be right out. Keep in mind we watched bartenders cleaning glassware this whole time and the perception we had was that making drinks for the service well just wasn't a priority. I really felt that the service timing wasn't Arianas fault. However, she should have involved her manager at this point. Letting a mgr know how long tickets are taking from the bar and kitchen is crucial.  We loved the deep seating on the patio. Love the design and how open it is. Not totally sure what the mexican blankets have to do with the decor though.  We also couldn't help but notice that the staff for the most part looked pretty sloppy. I get the more casual approach to uniforms these days but I personally think that if you want guests to appreciate your service you don't show up to work in wrinkled clothes with no effort given to your appearance. It's not just about taking the order and delivering the food. This is a beautiful new restaurant and the food is fabulous but the managers need to be more present. Talk to your guests, get out on the floor and see what's going on before it's too late. We all know how fleeting customer loyalty can be in a town that's ever evolving and we'd like to see you stay in the neighborhood awhile. Keep at it and we will be back to try you again soon.  P.s. The astro turf could use a Hokey or small broom.  There was lots of food crumbs and debris near the tables.",

    "text": "Thanks to this restaurant for giving us crappy service that we discovered Diego Pops. Go there instead. We only minded the really loud club music on Sunday at noon after we were seated and waited 10 min for no one to acknowledge us. Ashley, the hostess, lacked a sense of urgency and sensitivity towards ensuring customers were happy. The waitress in our section, with tray in hand (booging to Ellie Goulding), preferred to wait at a booth while her friend pulled up something on her mobile phone and bus a table, than to take our order. The random employee that dropped off our water needs to go get an office job where she doesn't deal with the general public. If you don't like people, don't work in a restaurant where people go to have a great time while eating good food. This is the 3rd time we have been at the restaurant, and it appears this place operates better when there are 10-15 customers. Anything more than that, don't bother. The floor manager needs to have additional training on how to ensure customers are well taken care of, attitudes are left at the employee entrance, and that customers don't walk away.",

What appeared to be dried snot and mucus (had little hairs in it)  on the salt and pepper shakers located on the outside table- deck area; facing Scottsdale road.   Strands of hair and lint on old utensil cloths.  Poorly responsive hosts at front stand.  I tried to flag one down since the server was busy and he looked me in the eye and ignored my \"excuse me sir\".   Place was pretty empty. Prime rib sandwich (fatty) soggy and the \"fried\" egg raw had loose yolk.  Due to the lack of cleanliness (and Poor quality food).  I only ate 10%  and was grossed out.  Didn't try to resolve it further because staff was blatantly  disinterested  in customer service.... ( even more so, service recovery).   Also it took the host 10 minutes to find a pen for me to sign the bill.  Normally, I leave a tip no matter what- but this time it was so bad I simply filled in the space on the bill with \"your tip will be my review on Yelp!\"  Go to breakfast club next door or  better yet,  McDonald's !!!!!!!!",

Most places would be annoyed with us, but they were so welcoming and were just as excited as we were to celebrate our bride to be. Oh- and the food and drinks were phenomenal. We cleaned our plates. Fabulous food and experience.",

The service was excellent, waters right away and happy hour menu listing all the specials. Tried the home made potatoe chips with onion dip and the hummus with veggies, brought out right away and both were very tasty.  Great location, great happy hour prices and awesome service.

We came once Saturday morning for a drink. We had the mimosas, great! The porch was perfect for the Scottsdale weather. The bubbly blonde working the patio was very friendly.   We came back today to actually eat. I had the prime rib sandwich and my boyfriend had the lobster roll. Both SO good!!!   My only complaint was the bar tenders today (there were 4 working), 3 seemed so unhappy and like they hated their job. Anytime we asked for another drink we got a death stare and got the feeling we were being irritating to them...the one male today back there seemed great. The 3 girls (2 blondes & 1 older woman) never asked how we were doing or if we wanted refills. They never smiled and seemed irritated when we asked for another cocktail.   Overall amazing food and GREAT environment but the attitudes bring it down.",

Pros:   -beautiful restaurant with great decor and ambience that makes you feel like you are in Key West or other resort beach city.  -live music and DJ -prices were reasonable, good value -indoor and outdoor seating with giant sliding windows   Cons:   -food was slow to come out. We waited 45 min - service was lacking.   Missing utensils, ask for condiments and no one brought it.  Waited 10 minutes for a drink, etc, etc.  -staff isn't very attentive.

I've been here a few times and the service is always slow, but today was off. It took 20 minutes for someone to bring us waters. A worker told me it was policy to not serve us until our whole party was here. Everyone's order was wrong. The server tried to make up by bringing us free shots, but then made it seem like a burden to separate all our or receipts for a party of 10. I wouldn't recommend if you are with a big group. Just go to the bar. One of the servers was crying in the bathroom and our server had to of been stoned out of his mind. I would not recommend this place to anyone unless you have a lot of free time.",

I had to send my food (breakfast sandwich) back 3 times and both my friends had to send theirs back. The manager made it seem like we were an inconvenience.   Also while I was sitting my pants got stuck to the back of the booth bc there were pieces of gum stuck to it. So I had gum all over my clothes.   Here are the reasons why it didn't get a 1 star:  The best thing here at the Montauk are their drinks and my waitress, and the hostess Angie is absolutely wonderful!  Our waitress was also amazing (Morgan) and defused the situations beautifully and handled everything professionally and has a great sense of humor!",

This has NEVER ever happened to me ! I live in old town and eat out almost daily there . This manager was rude, obnoxious and flat out not a good leader for that establishment. I recommend going next door to Dingo Pops that's where we went and the food was amazing , the service impeccable. The manager at Dingo Pops said that they get customers more than once a day from  Montauk who are upset with the horrible rude service . That manager needs to go! L Lliterally",

My coworker and I both ordered it with chicken and instead of an over easy egg, we went with scrambled.   Our boss said he paid for tab and waited a bit since it didn't show up. He never saw his server again and had to ask someone else about the takeout order. Honestly, he thinks they either forgot about it after it was made or it wasn't made until he asked.   When he got back to the office, I would say it was barely warm but I still enjoyed it as is. While I haven't been to this place in person, I'd like to try it out and be able to give them more stars. My meal was just okay - nothing special. I make cauliflower fried rice once in a while so I was not wow-ed by this. Bacon was crisp so that was a plus. The takeout container they used made the portion seem really small when you open it, but it is a decent amount.   It just sounded like a mediocre place after listening to our boss about his lunch.",

The atmosphere is very appealing and is a great place to go if you want to spend time with friends. The patio is so cozy and unique. You can sit outside even if it's cold because the heaters are fantastic. The service was excellent but more importantly the food was excellent. You will get healthy and very fresh options here. This is an excellent choice if you want to go out but stay healthy. I had the Tequila Lime Shrimp bowl and it was delicious. The food is seasoned perfectly and the flavors all complimented one another. My friend ordered the Orange Teriyaki Salmon bowl and loved her's as well. The portions are just right. This place is the right choice for those of you who want to be healthy and still go out!!",

If you order a side of fruit you will get 2 small slices of melon and orange. There is not much variety and hardly anything you can eat if your gluten free like me.   The main reason I will not be returning is how incredibly HOT it is inside. It's no surprise that Arizona summers can be upwards of 100 degrees. We were sweating through our meal and left immediately when we we're done. I've experienced this on 2-3 visits.",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I decided to try The Montauk for dinner last night, but unfortunately, we weren't that impressed. We had been here once before for brunch, and though the food wasn't memorable to me, I did like the atmosphere and look of the restaurant, and I wanted to try the dinner menu.  The service was good for the most part - we were seated right away and didn't have to wait long to put in our drink and food orders. The only problem was that we ordered an appetizer we really wanted to try, the Crispy Rock Shrimp, and never received it. When we got our meals before the appetizer, we assumed our waitress just hadn't heard us, but were later surprised to see it on our bill. Luckily she was really easygoing about it and took the charge off right away, but it was still kind of a bummer.   For dinner, my boyfriend ordered the Fish and Chips, and I got the Turkey and Egg Sandwich. Neither of us really liked our food, and we're really not that picky, so it's not like this happens often lol. For him, the fish was really plain - just battered with no seasoning. I thought the sandwich was a little bland as well considering all of the toppings (tomato, havarti, avocado, and pesto aioli). To me, it was really just a mess, and I was surprised it was just on a plain hamburger bun, because that made it really soggy.  I will say that their french fries are delicious, I'd have been happy with just an order of those :) another redeeming quality for this place is their happy hour (M-F, 3-6p). Draft beers are only $3, and they offer all of their appetizers for half price!",

    "text": "My mother was visiting me from out of town and was telling me she was dying for a lobster roll. So I did my research and found that The Montauk had lobster rolls, so I decided to take her there! I was very surprised when we pulled up and there was so much parking (I've tried to come here before but parking was insane so I went else where). So we walk in and the restaurant was pretty slow, I would say there was about five other tables that were occupied. We go to the host and she walks over, making no eye contact and i told her it would just be a table for two. She then says \"sit where you want\", no hello no nothing. So we find a table and she sets the menus down and walks away. Our server than came over and tells us about the happy hour they have going on. She could have not cared any less when she was talking to us. She was the the coldest and most un-hospitable server I think I have ever had. She made no effort what so ever to be nice or to even have some sort of conversation with us. At one point we were completely out of our drinks and she walked directly by our table and I asked politely for refills and she walks by and goes to her register and barely acknowledged me, but she obviously heard me because she came back and picked them up to refill. I have worked in the customer service field for 10+ years, and I totally understand that it gets busy and stressful. But there was less than FIVE tables being served, so her demeanor and attitude was completely un called for. When we wrapped up and asked for the check, she threw the check on the table, we put our card in it and she took it, charged it and never said one more word to us. The reason I am giving the three stars is because the food was SO GOOD! I hope the owners or management see this review and the other not so good reviews on here so they can properly train their staff. I have family and friends come in town frequently and I love to show them around and take them to cool places, but I will unfortunately have to skip this place until everyone's customer service standards are raised.",

It took quite a while for a server to greet us. We were considering asking the hostess to confirm she let someone know we had been seated but every time a server appeared we delayed, thinking surely they would acknowledge us any second.   I had the warm lobster roll. It was real lobster - that's about all I have nice to say about it. It is served on a standard hot dog bun - so it's pretty tiny to boot. There was no evidence of dressing on the lobster and it was poorly assembled - the bun was not deep enough to accommodate the lobster (I'd estimate about 1/4c). There was a side of butter - but no signs of aioli (hint: it should look like mayo, not drawn butter) I know we are in the desert but at $20 there's a food truck in town that is a WAY better value and makes The Montauk's weak offering look bad.  The honey jalapeno chicken sandwich was another disappointment. The chicken was plain tasting - especially considering what the name would inspire your mouth to imagine.  I like the decor, the live music and the OJ that comes with the mimosa is very good. Another cool thing was that they had a  pancake artist offering super cool free pancakes (for tips) on the patio. The pancake, like everything else we ate here, was thin and flavorless -- but it really did look cool!",

I'm not sure if they were down a server but we were not the only unhappy table.   Once we got our food, however, we were very pleased. Better than expected given the rest up until then. The fish tacos were very good and a large serving for $12. Haystack fries, crispy Brussels sprouts, and lobster roll all excellent as well. Good prices for good portions, just have to mind the wait for service.",

I've had her cocktails by the pool and at Montauk and consistency is huge for a classic cocktail each time. I'm super particular about my old fashions and this is one of 5 establishments in Old Town where I know I can trust any staff can make a a quality cocktail. Just Keep her behind the bar and I guarantee customers will leave reviews like this one  Plus the Crispy Rock Shrimp  and Tuna Tartare Guacamole  are to die for",

It was easily over 20 minutes and the restaurant was not full, in fact, there were only about 10 of us there. I wasn't starving so I did not mind waiting and the restaurant is beautifully decorated. After my food came, the manager walked over and apologized for the long wait and said he was comping the entire meal bc he was so sorry about the long wait! Amazing and so nice! The waitress was lovely and sweet, as well.   The food in all honesty was just ok. I've definitely had better fish tacos and Mac and cheese. I prefer fish that is grilled, rather than fried in my tacos. I had a drink called the Endless Summer, which was nice. I was just visiting in Phoenix but in the future I would definitely return to the Montauk to try other dishes and because the service was so excellent.",

Felt kind of like we were being ignored because we weren't with a big party.  When our food and drinks finally arrived they were both just ok. My fiancee drink came with once ice cube left in it because it was probably sitting for so long.  The waitress was very sweet but all in all not a good experience",

The level of apathy that the wait staff and hostesses possess is almost comical. It's like they're actually trying as hard as they can to suck.   Anyways, this place is situated in a really cool spot on Scottsdale road. Great people watching spot. As the name implies, you get that summer in the Hamptons feel with the decor (the snobby attitudes as well).   The food really isn't anything to boast about. Prime rib sandwich was very dry but has the potential to be good. They didn't skimp on the meat which was nice. My friend ordered avocado toast and they just brought out toast with no avocado. I mean cmon. It's in the name on the menu. Needless to say the waitress expressed no interest in my friends quarrel with the toast and finally brought out avocado toast about 25 minutes later.   The drinks were actually pretty good ( I got the watermelon mule) but not good enough to allow me to give this place more than 1 star. Your service and general attitude just killed it for me. Work on your CRM skills a little bit and this place could be killer.   This place has great potential given the location but unfortunately as long as this is still The Montauk, I will not be coming back.",

The Montauk is definitely more about the scene than the food. My wife and I both had the Prime Rib sandwich and it was good but not amazing. The waiter felt a little \"on the run\" - which is different than what we've experienced from other Old Town Scottsdale Restaurants. Everyone was friendly. The live music forced everyone to have to yell to be heard - the waiter couldn't even hear me when we were talking - it was very loud. If you are a young single looking for the Scottsdale scene Montauk is probably a good choice but if you are a married couple out on a date night happy to get a few moments away from the kids, might want to go somewhere else.",

Their version of Crispy Brussels sprouts were so bad almost like it was boiled in water. We had to send back every Brussels sprout order we got. After awhile the rolling the eyes waitress said \"well maybe we should just take them off the menu!\" We all said \"YES! we think you should.\"    We asked for separate checks and guess what. One check that we all had to divide all by ourselves!   The icing on the cake....everyone had got their dinner order but me and another. He got his 5 mins after everyone else but Me? Nope I had to wait 15-20mins while staring at everyone finishing their plates. by the time I received my dish I was the only One eating and everyone had their plates Cleared and taken away.   I've never had such bad service before and it's astonishing because of this place being right in old town and I've heard so much.   I will not be coming back here!  P.S. The manager was very kind to deduct our bill for the service and maybe was a bit overwhelmed for a second.",

She was extremely accommodating during our time there, starting by providing us with a phone charger device. We had just traveled and needed some juice in our phones.   We began with a couple of drinks. My friend ordered a glass of Rose and I ordered the Rose Sangria. Both were fabulous! The bartender also made sure to keep our waters full throughout our time there.   We decided to try some appetizers while here also. We first tried the Roasted Garlic Hummus, which came with pieces of soft, yet toasted bread that was to die for. It also had carrots and celery on the plate. The restaurant was gracious enough to provide us with more bread and veggies when we ran out. Next, we ordered the Fried Chicken Sliders that had a slaw on it that was sweet. Again, another outstanding dish.   This place was a great way to kick off our week in Scottsdale and we would definitely go back next time we visit.",

The food is great but unfortunately after the service we received today I don't think we will be returning.  First, the host was rude seating us when we didn't want to sit at a lounge table outside, then apparently didn't tell any servers that we were there because it took a half hour for someone to finally touch our table.  Second, when the food finally came one of our orders were wrong, and not only that, but we didn't get the corrected food until 20 minutes after everyone else had finished eating. It took telling three different people and the manager to finally get our food.  And lastly when it was finally time to pay our server didn't come around for such a long time that we eventually got up to pay because we were tired of waiting.  I've never done a negative review before but I just really hope that the message gets across to their staff how important having a sense of urgency and good communication is.",

We asked for more. We also ordered a lobster roll and salad to share. After waiting a very long time we asked the bartender if it was coming shortly. He forgot to order it. He was busy training a pretty young bartender and was too occupied with this to take care of the 4 people at the bar. Perhaps they should train bartenders and wait staff when there are no customers present.",

    "text": "We were attracted to this spot because our grandmother lived in Montauk and we summered there throughout our childhood. Unfortunately our experience was very disappointing. Once our party of 4 were seated we ordered our beverages, I ordered coffee and it came out cold --twice. My sister ordered an iced tea and was given a Coke. The entire beverage confusion lasted 30 minutes -  back-and-forth back-and-forth with long periods waiting for the right beverage. We ordered our entrees they never arrived, instead we were given four appetizer plates, we are not sure why since we did not order appetizers -- and the plates had dirt and grease on them. That was it. We left a $20 bill on the table for the beverages and we walked out. We never got an apology from anyone. Not from the bar back who brought out the Coke, not from the bartender who brought out the cold coffees, not from the waitress who brought out the dirty dishes. Honestly at that point, we were afraid to even eat the food if it ever came out. We walked across the street to a delightful restaurant called \"the breakfast club\" or something like that, and they served us instantly and the food was delicious. Too bad we so wanted to like the Montauk. I guess our memories of the actual town of Montauk will have to do.",

    "text": "I am not really sure what to think of this place. I was left standing at the host stand for fifteen minutes with plenty of staff walking by me. It was weird. No one said hello or offered to help me. Not a great first impression. I sat on the patio for a while waiting for my friends. The patio is very pretty! When my friends came we were seated right away and the service improved greatly. In fact, the server was very good!   So now onto the food. Well, here we go again. The items on the menu were not available yet. The sever said they wouldn't have some of the food until after their grand opening in two weeks. I had bad luck with ordering. All the things I wanted were not available yet. What I find strange is that they have been open for a few weeks now so this is unacceptable in my opinion. The charming and humorous waiter saved that, but still.   The restaurant itself is pretty and has a nice layout. However, the restaurant claims to have a Long Island theme as the name and menu suggests but the bathroom has Flamingos on the wallpaper and the wall has a steer on it. lol. Maybe it is meant to be eclectic.   I had the Prime Rib sandwich which was good. The salad with it was nothing special and the fries they served for us as a replacement to the sold out chips were just okay. They were not as good as the ones at other local places.   Finally, the place plays very loud music. They did turn it down when we asked. I have to be honest and say I will be fair and go back and try it again. However, they will have to really impress me to consider going back a third time. I hope they iron out their opening kinks.",

Joel was our server and he knew exactly what we wanted, when we wanted it! His energy was contagious and 7 bottles of champagne later, we were so glad we didn't go somewhere else. Joel refilled our juices and cleared our plates without us asking! Max came by our table to see how we were doing too. Amazing!!!   We're 100% coming back next weekend for Sunday Funday !!!!!!!!!",

While I appreciate that it's not the sleek Scottsdale norm of brushed steel and granite, I'm not sure it fits together terribly well.  What's even stranger is that the bathrooms look like they were plucked out of a Scottsdale-brushed-steel-granite restaurant.  The stalls are roomy and there's more than enough room for a set or two of jumping jacks.",

My friend and I sat at the bar and immediately felt uncomfortable. The crowd here was definitely the older single crowd desperately trying to find someone. We were just looking to get a quality drink and hang out. The music was on very loud for a bar/restaurant, so loud we could barely talk. We each had a drink and both were mediocre at best. I had their pimm's cup, which was probably the worst Pimm's cup I've ever had. It lacked the refreshing and sweet quality that makes for a good pimm's. My friend had a gin and tonic with fruit... except it was all gin and one slice of fruit.... it was almost undrinkable. The scene and the drinks were not really my thing... I don't think I'd be back, especially not on a weekend night.",

The place is well decorated and has a nice outdoor seating area. The one bad part about the setting is the music. The volume was way too loud for people to talk to each other. That might be OK for Saturday night but this was Sunday morning brunch.  Unfortunately this appears to be a restaurant that is put a lot more attention into their decorating them into either their food or their service. They messed up both my order and my wife's order. They brought her appetizers out after they brought the food out. And one of the dishes with fish was undercooked. Overall it wasn't worse place we've ever been but it was definitely not a place we will try again.",

The waitress who had tables around us was kicking ass while Kardi was Mia. I would have spent more money as she never asked us if we wanted anything else or even another drink. She barely spoke to us after we ordered our food, and never said thank u or even much of a word to us. She SUCKS. She is lucky she even got a tip. I am sorry we weren't 20 and day drinkers but we spend money and honestly I am not sure I would come back or recommend this place again. Fire her if u know what's good for your businesses",

Atmosphere was pleasant and it's a great place to go if you have a ton of work to do and need to wait for your drink. A little disappointed since all of my work was done and the drink was the first thing on my mind. LOVE the concept of the oversized ice cube...however, the whole displacement concept somehow gets thrown off so it's like you get half the drink. (Like I said, work was done.) Switched to a wine ..this time service was prompt, but unfortunately the wine had turned and so our response was CHECK PLEASE!
