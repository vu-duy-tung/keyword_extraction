The fish was rather bland and the sauce was rather overwhelming.  We also ordered a spicy ramen with the pork. This was the best dish we had.  Pork was cooked very well and the broth was creamy and rich..My only complaint? It was very much on the salty side.   The agadashi tofu was mediocre and also drenched in a ponzu that was more like a diluted soy then a light tangy ponzu  Service was also quite poor.  I sat there for about fifteen minutes without getting as much as a water.....",

We waited an hour for our rolls, and they gave us the wrong rolls twice. They took back the rolls and then we had to wait even longer for the correct rolls - and remember, this happened twice. How about making your customers feel a little better about the experience and let them have the mistake roll (I'm sure cucumbers and rice doesn't equal a huge profit loss). Glad we tried it. Never coming back. I don't think the table that was next to us will either from what we heard.",

Why they didn't tell us that as soon as they noticed? Instead, we had to inquire twice. the first time about 25min in. When we were told, 'oh yes your order is next.' Then, we asked after another 10min. This time there was a huddled discussion between the manager and chef and we were told they had just run out. But when we saw them bring out more for other diners, I had to yelp about it. Even worse was the terrible \"customer service\" from the manager. Our server never showed up again. They put mayo on items we requested they didn't. All in all, the food was good when receive as ordered but it wasn't enough to make up for the inadequate service.",

Kenny was always willing to make a special off-menu dish (I never asked for one if they were swamped) and they sometimes have specials you won't get in most places, like the time they had a fresh sea urchin (delicious).  Also, get the fresh (real) wasabi.  You won't regret it.    Alas my time in Phoenix ended (a while ago - somehow I forgot to post this review) and this spot is what I miss most.

The younger gentlemen who greeted us was super friendly, sat us right away and brought our drinks over right away too. However, he was the ONLY part of the service that night that was good. The waitress who took our order seemed new? She didn't know what agedashi tofu was and didn't seem very happy to be there and neither did the other two waitresses (one of them being the owner). However,  I will say that the food is great! This is probably THE BEST moderately priced sushi you will get in AZ. I'm from Hawaii so I know fresh sushi/sashimi! : )   We ordered the following items.  APPETIZER: Agedashi Tofu - this was EXCELLENT! VERY lightly battered, perfect crisp and the dash broth surprisingly was the perfect soupy consistency and not too salty!  SUSHI: We ordered the Spicy Scallop Sushi (Gunkan), and the Sweet Potato Tempura Roll. The Spicy Scallop was pretty fresh, no the best I've had but definitely not bad. The consistency of the rice here is fairly decent! The sweet potato roll I could love it or leave it. The sweet potato was crispy and delicious but I think because it was piping hot when it was rolled up, it ended up heating up the rice a bit and making it a tad mushy.  BENTO: We ordered the Combination Bento Box with Salmon and Beef Teriyaki. It came with a full size California roll. The roll had very little rice which I can definitely appreciate and the inside was STUFFED so the bento box was a great deal!! It also came with miso soup and a side salad.  MISC: We decided to try the Shrimp Yaki-Udon. The udon could've been a bit more al dente but overall, not too shabby at all!!  As the evening progressed our wait staff became more friendly which was nice and the busser (who was also the one who initially greeted us at the door) was super diligent about drink refills and taking away the dishes we were finished with.  In regards to the decor, it's very chic! It's a new spot so it's super clean. The interior finishes are all very modern and the both times we've been here it's been a nice and quiet dining experience. I'll definitely be back!! : )",

    "text": "This will be very first review on yelp and it is very deserving of my praise.   This is a small business, with a small staff, but they are passionate about serving the vey best sushi possible.  I always have the sushi bar salad and the yellowtail sashimi there, but I also love the ninja jalapenos, the ginban roll, the caterpillar roll, the tuna, the salmon, the eel, and the fact that they have banana in some of their rolls, which is way more awesome than I expected.  I love their saki's too and I always get a peach saki and mango salad when I'm feeling like desert.  If that sounds at all interesting to you, you have to try it, it's an amazing combination.",

Inside is very clean and service was quick and friendly.  Prices were pretty standard for what I'm used to.  Ordered the lunch special and spicy Edamame.  It was enough for a lunch.  All together, was okay.  Best I've had since moving here.  Does not compare to my favorite, Shiwase in McKinney,Tx.",

Service was OK but still slow considering there were only two other tables during lunch. Another sign this place is not at the top of their game.  I might return in a pinch if I'm in this area but I certainly would not make a habit of coming back here. Their prices are far more expensive for the quality of food and portions.  This is at best a three star restaurant",

    "text": "Ginban has become our go-to family sushi spot in A-town...it's excellent...only thing holding this pace back is inconsistent service.   The place is modern and stylish, especially considering the strip mall location.  The sushi bar is attractive and functional. There are TVs strategically placed around the restaurant, which is perfect if you want to catch snippets of the Blackhawks playoff match out of the corner of your eye while pretending to give your family your full attention.   The food is outstanding. The salmon sashimi is fresh and delicious and the yellowtail is among the best I've tasted.  I'm not a big roll fan, but the family really likes theirs; especially the Tiger Roll and the Eel Avocado roll.  The Unagi is really good as well. I've also tried the chicken teriyaki, which was good and tastefully presented but not life-changing.   The beer selection is just fine. The usual Japanese staples plus one or two nice surprises (Dog Fish Head 60 Minute IPA, I think!). Could be served colder, but whatever.   I get that handcrafted sushi can take a while, but they need to get it together.  Orders come out at odd times, like last night all three courses of my dinner were served long before the rest of the family received even their first morsel  of delicious raw fish.  There is also the occasional mistake, like the time we received ahi sashimi instead of salmon, but these things happen. One thing that would really help would be if the servers could kick up their attentiveness. They always avoid you like you've got SARS during these awkward long waits.  Invariably we want another beer or to add to our sushi order, but there is no one to be found...or even anyone willing to make eye-contact!  Of course, during a grown-up dinner with epic quantities of sake bombers they should take their sweet-damn-time bringing the fish.   Ultimately, we still love this place despite its flaws. The sushi is worth the wait and we have resolved to plan ahead more, but a little better service would mean a lot regardless.",

The roll from Sushiya is called a snowball and the one at Ginban is a Crazy Roll and Ginban's roll is even better!!!!.  I also got a Philadelphia which everyone makes the same so I knew it was a good comparison to start with.    WOW I think I just burst my own bubble...  Well after some looking it seems that other places have a similar roll to a Snowball but call them Jalapeno rolls (deep fried, Inside: Jalapenos, crab, and cream cheese.  Topped with spicy mayo, eel sauce, green onions and masago.)  The only difference with Ginban is that their Crazy Rolls has crunchy spicy salmon, avocado on top.  Everything else is the same.  If I had to choose between RA and Ginban I would pick Ginban every time!  I liked the feel of the place much better and the quality of the sushi was better too.  Ginban is going into our rotation of regular lunch spots.",

    "text": "This restaurant is a hidden gem here in Phoenix. Having lived in Los Angeles, Ginban Sushi rivals any of the sushi eateries on the West Coast. Also they have a very friendly staff and a wonderful selection of Japanese cuisine.  In my opinion their Happy Hour is the best in Ahwautukee and has a nice variety of beers and sushi rolls to choose from. Too many restaurants have a very limited Happy Hour menu, especially in Ahwautukee. However, Ginban Sushi's is great. I prefer the salmon bento box for lunch which comes with a fresh salad and delicious miso soup. Finally, one of my pet peeves is cleanliness. There is an old saying that if a restaurant is clean in the front of the house then the back of the house (kitchen) is most likely the same. Ginban Sushi is always spotless each and every time I have eaten there. It's located next to Fry's Supermarket on Chandler Blvd near the intersection of 40th Street.",

So I'm always in the market for a good traditional sushi place with fresh ingredients and skills behind the sushi bar. I would've gone for their rice alone! Perfect texture. Chewy and moist. Ginger was yellow not pink! Miso was fresh and not loaded with sodium straight from the box. I ordered a Bento lunch box for $10 and it came with two gyoza, side of rice, Cali roll, and 4 fresh nigiri sushi, plus soup , salad, fruit. I'm always grateful when those dining around me don't wonder why I am crying when I eat. Like is the sushi that good?! Yes... *sniff sniff... Yes it was. Plus I like my ponzu sauce green with wasabi because I love the buuurrrnn!!",

There  were no blatant offenses, but even though there were only a few tables occupied in the entire restaurant, the server kept bringing food to our table that the table next to us ordered, and taking all of our food to them. The table next to us was more annoyed than we were, and shook their heads in frustration and said no that's theirs. It seems like the server was totally spaced out. The food itself was good. We ordered from the happy hour menu, which is quite reasonable. We got Gyoza, calamari, snow white roll, salmon nigiri, tuna nigiri and a lovely fresh salad from the sushi chef. I wish they would do some training so that The service wasn't so bad.",

Second of all I waited to long for a sushi roll and chicken on a stick when there were no customers. After I received food, my sushi roll was okay but the chicken was horrible and not flavorful at all! I took a bite out of it and requested that it get sent back.   Here comes the nonsense....   I got my bill... The so called manager only took a dollar off  and charged me pretty much for something I didn't eat. I asked to speak to the owner because I explained that it's not the money that matters it's the principal and how you treat your customers.. She said that he was in the back and did speak English.. O_o... That was fine with me...I then requested to have him come out while she Translate... She said he was very busy in the back... I told her I would wait... Then she said that he wasn't there... So, I asked her how could a owner be in two places at once if she just talked to him.. And all over a sudden he is not there.. Then she started to ignore me.. Mind you my voice never gets elevated.... I step outside for a minute.. Came back in when she would be ready to listen.. I asked for a phone number to one of there many owners she claimed previously that this company has... She said she didn't know there number... I asked her to go talk to the owner \"in the back\"  and figured it with him... After the longest 30 mins of my life, and her realizing that I wasn't going getting anywhere she finally broke down and gave me  a 5 dollar coupon... O_O.... Like I would spend anymore money in a place which tells lies and has poor customer service the only reason  why she gave it to me is so I would not write this review .. Long story short... Dont come here and waste your time.. Although the inside looks great customer service fails majorly... Just drive the extra mile and  half and go to RA sushi bar on Ray Rd.",

I've tried other sushi places around here and none are as good. I usually get take out, but sometimes dine in. One time we did get an order of Gyoza that was burned a bit. The manager was appalled and replaced it right away. Things like that happen, I won't ding a restaurant for that as long as they take care of it.   My kids love the bento boxes. I like the rolls. All of the rolls are good, but my favorites are the Ginban roll and crunchy roll. Something my husband learned working at a sushi restaurant is to always try the house roll.  If you haven't tried the Ginban roll you have to! It's amazing. Prices are pretty comparable to other places. They do have lunch specials, happy hour specials, and 20% off specialty rolls after 8 pm.  p.s. I'm not sure what the other reviewer meant about non Japanese owners. I'm pretty sure they are Japanese, as I had some Japanese friends who would go there to eat and speak with them in Japanese.",

Then I ordered a Kirin, and a different server brought a Kirin Light. I let them know the mistake, and they said if I hadn't poured it into my glass they could have put the bottle cap back on and not wasted it. Embarrassed on their behalf, I offered to keep the wrong beer. I guess the Sushi would have to be phenomenal for me to want to come here again, but I'll never know because I would be worried the sushi was prepped correctly given the other problems in such a short span of time.",

    "text": "Came here craving teriyaki chicken and wanting to try a new Japanese place. Overall, the experience was OK. We were seated quickly, but afterwards, service was on the slower side, especially when waiting for the main dish.  Miso soup and salad were decent, but the teriyaki chicken was -- like other reviews have stated -- bland. On the positive side, the portion was large and consisted of juicy chicken breast instead of cheap, fatty meat. The vegetables were also yummy and well-marinated. However, this dish cannot be called chicken teriyaki. The sauce was thin and had an oniony flavor (from the onion base below the chicken) instead of being thicker and distinctly teriyaki.  Unsatisfied with the food, so would not come again.",

The quality of fish is fresh (well, as fresh as it gets for AZ, being that we are in the middle of the desert with not much access to SUPER fresh fish straight from the ocean). The specialty rolls are all great, I have not had one that I didn't like, and I have tried almost all of them.  Service is great as well, everyone there is super sweet and rolls don't take long to get to you. I would recommend this place to anyone new to sushi and even sushi snobs, like me!  -except for the calamari, I do not recommend that at all",

They also have happy hour all day on Sunday's, so that helped swayed our decision. After waiting about 20 minutes for our food, I ended up getting the Crazy Roll and the boyfriend tried the Dynamite roll. The Crazy roll was supposed to be spicy, but it actually turned out to be extremely sweet and not what I was hoping for at all. Almost had a banana taste to it. I thought  his Dynamite roll was delicious and wish I would have ordered that instead.   Also, even though it says happy hour all day on Sunday's, the speciality rolls are only 20% off AFTER 8:30 that evening. Made this mistake of not reading the fine print.",

    "text": "Super mixed feelings about this spot. When we first walked in, the hostess wasn't the nicest. She pointed us to tables and when we requested the sushi bar, she just pointed to our seats in an annoyed manner. Ok, whatever...  Husband and I sat down an introduced ourselves to the sushi chef. He responded, \"Huh?\", then we repeated ourselves and the same response, \"Huh?\". I thought there was a language barrier, so I didn't think anything of it...Until we ordered. Turns out the dude DOES speak English and apparently didn't feel like talking to us. Ok...whatever...  We checked out the Happy Hour menu and ordered 2 large hot sake's, spicy tuna roll and salmon roll. Now, I'm not a huge fan of sushi rolls. My husband likes to order a roll as a \"sample\" to see how it's prepared, how sweet the sauce is and what the rice is like. Kinda like a taste test. I prefer sashimi ( No rice - extra radish.) The rolls were ok. They tasted like rolls. Not great and not bad. Then came our sake bombs. 2 large ones. The beer was room temperature and the sake was ok. Then came our 2 salads - Seaweed and Sushi bar salad. Sushi bar salad was made to order. Cucumber noodles made in front of us. SUPER GOOD! Then 2 more sake bombs! Then we moved on to albacore nigri, tuna nigri and salmon skin roll. Then the hand rolls arrived and I don't know WHY, but they stuff theirs with romaine lettuce. Romaine lettuce?! WHY?! Totally fucking annoying!  As I'm drinking my beer, my husband elbows me and together we see the sushi chef open a shrink wrapped piece of frozen tuna, place it on a paper towel, (without rinsing it) and he proceeds to plate it into the sushi case. WHAT THE DID WE JUST SEE?! I get it, we're in the desert, but can you defrost the frozen fish in the back and MAKE us THINK it's fresh? So many questions were being asked in my head. Not OK. No one wants to see that.  The service from the waitress ended up being really good. She was super prompt with our $2.50 powdered miso soups and drinks and she did check on us often.   We went for happy and spent close to $90. Will I go back? Probably not.",

    "text": "I found myself here because I purchased a Groupon...oddly enough, it is right next to the grocery store I frequent every week, and yet I never noticed it. Sometimes I go to  the grocery store to buy sushi rolls, oblivious that I am walking past a sushi restaurant.  That is  because from the outside, it looks like nothing.  At least nothing safe. The windows are completely black.  I had some buyers remorse once I saw the outside.  But, as the saying goes, \"you can't judge a book by it's cover\" because the inside provided the atmosphere I was expecting, down to the fish tank.  I loved the menu.  If you love raw fish, you too will love this menu.  Our dinner was pretty cliche, with miso soup, caterpillar roll, spicy tuna roll, and saki bombers.  At the end, we ordered mochi ice cream, which was totally foreign to me. I am still confused about this item...it is basically ice cream that is covered in chewy candy, like a soft gummy bear (or an Airhead is a better description, if you are familiar with candy).   It reminds me of the time I put chocolate ice cream on my baked potato.  The ice cream absorbed into the potato, leaving me a chocolate potato (and hey, don't judge, if you ever dipped a french fry into a Wendy's Frostie, you know what I am talking about). Anyway, my point -- some things are just texturally an odd pairing, even when they  taste good.  But, the whole thing was covered in whipped cream and drizzled in chocolate sauce.....so, whatever, I'd eat it again.",

Overall, the salmon was deliciously buttery but the snapper tasted a bit funky. The Snow White roll was great incorporating snow crab but the happy hour price ($9) didn't make me that happy with every other roll on there being around $4. I think the highlight for me personally was the salmon skill roll which is normally hard to find in Sushi places around Chandler (or they make the recipe kind of odd, or taste burnt).  Overall, I would probably visit again but try some other rolls and stick with Salmon for deliciousness.",

We have only been there a handful of times, but today we decided to make Ginban our \"go-to\" place. The sushi is nothing less than amazing. Live scallop (a featured item), jalapeno yellowtail, tiger roll, takosu (octopus with asparagus)...all so very fresh and excellently prepared! The sashimi is awesome and the oysters (Hamahama and Kumamoto) will leave the most spectacular essence of ocean lingering on your taste buds! The people next to us at the sushi bar today got a teriyaki chicken that was almost like all the best parts of a sizzling plate of fajitas: sizzling (goes without saying) and the smell was wonderful! The Sushi Chefs are masters. Kenny, the Head Chef, is personable and takes great pride in his preparations. Vivian, the Owner/Manager is eager to please and very proud of her establishment. She also has given us the best recommendations to try new items that we might not have been so ready to order on our own. Stepping out of our sushi comfort zone at Ginban has been a most pleasant surprise! The atmosphere is low-key, quiet and very enjoyable (we have only gone during the late lunch/early afternoon time, which is very much our speed). The restaurant, itself, is very clean and the design is about as \"chic\" as Ahwatukee has to offer. Give it a try. You won't be disappointed. (If you have been disappointed, give it another chance, especially if you have the opportunity during non-rush hours.)",

Maguro was ok, hamachi was not as fatty as it should of been but the salmon was really good. It came with 6 pieces of spicy tuna roll, which was ok, not spicy enough for my taste. In my opinion, had too much rice in that platter combination.  Since it was happy hour, I tried the gyoza, don't bother, had no taste.  Lastly, the sushi had no wasabi in it as it usually does, so I had to ask for extra. I don't think I'll go back unless I am starving.",

Atmosphere nice, but was too warm for our comfort.  Soup and salad pretty good. My sashimi....... average tasting. Tempura veggies were soggy and greasy. Tempura shrimp not a light dry batter. Gyoza, pretty good. California roll, average. Service satisfactory, but not much more. Overall, this won't be our New sushi place.",

We went there all the time and we understand mistakes happen and we weren't going to be upset but my boyfriend called to let them know so they could pull the ingredients to avoid others getting sick and the manager got defensive. She refused to believe it could have been their food (it was all I had that day) and was confrontational and rude the whole phone call. Very disappointing. I honestly loved that restaurant enough I would have eaten there again. Now I won't go back not because of the food poisoning but because of their service",

    "text": "Basis for my starred ratings (which skews heavily to the food or drink): 1 star:  Never again. 2 stars:  Poor food, poor experience, extraordinary measures in order for me to come back. 3 stars:  Average, nothing really special, nothing particularly bad. 4 stars:  Very good, would definitely return. 5 stars:  A favorite, one of the best.  I'm typically loathe to give a 2-star review to a place that's clean and where the service was good enough, but given the quality of the food, I'm surprised by the rating here.  Less surprised if they are based mostly on ordering rolls, where extra rice, sauce, and other fillings hide the quality of the fish.  Tried to order oysters and uni on a Wednesday.  Said they don't have any - typically only on Fridays and Saturdays.  I've tried to keep this fact out of my review.  Started with the soft shell crab and ordered the sushi deluxe for my entree.  My concerns were initially raised with the soup and salad.  Typical salad with citrus/ginger dressing.  Grainy and overly sweet.  They use white miso in their miso soup and it was essentially flavorless - not enough miso.  But these were free add-ins so tried to get past that.  Soft shell crab comes out, panko crusted - it is well prepared.  The sauce that comes with it is quite good.  Probably the best thing I ate that night with the exception of the black meat in the crab.  You expect a certain amount of muddiness in eating the black meat, but this was off-muddy.  The legs and white meat portions were great, but my concerns of the freshness of the crab based on the black meat leads me to  my sushi.  Nigiri with a spicy tuna roll.  The spicy tuna roll was neither here nor there - under-flavored but passable.  They give you two pieces of nigiri for almost every type of fish on the plate except the more expensive fish - like yellowtail.  They're running a business, I can ignore that too.  I couldn't ignore the rice to fish ratio, which was far too much rice.  And I couldn't ignore that fact that the rice was coming straight from the open rice cooker into the sushi, meaning it is most likely not seasoned at all and if it is, it is with the flavoring powder, which i still couldn't taste when I tried to rice on its own.    The quality of the fish was not good.  The salmon was very sinewy.  The tuna (not albacore) was my biggest concern.  The freshest tuna has almost no flavor.  The best tuna for sushi, after a couple days, opens up flavors of the actual fish but more like the blood and irony richness that accompanies it, along with some brininess.  This tuna was past that.  Fishy and too soft.  With the exception of a few fish (i.e. mackerel), no sushi fish should taste fishy.    Same goes for the albacore and other fish on the plate.  The yellowtail was passable, as was the escolar (aka white \"tuna\").    I get it.  You get what you pay for, and this place is pretty cheap.  But even for a local joint, the value of the meal here can't overcome the deficiencies in the fish that they serve, which is really, really subpar.  Plenty of non-Japanese owners have opened up very good sushi joints, but this is not one of them.",

We stopped at a restaurant before this one and it was jampacked! I was not about to wait so I found this place - luckily!  When we walked in, the restaurant was empty. I was surprised because the ambiance is trendy.  I didn't care though and proceeded to order the Volcano roll and Hawaiian roll.  Both were fabulous! I also ordered the tempura red bean ice cream and that one was a fail.  The bowl that it came in was too small and the ice cream was so hard that it felt like it was in the freezer for months.   However, the sushi did hit the spot and they probably saved me from eating at a chain fast food restaurant (yuck).  If you are in the area, I definitely think you should try this place!",

The waiter just stared at me and asked if I wanted to order something else. I thought it very rude as I wanted what I ordered AS I ORDERED IT. This made me very uncomfortable and made my visit extremely awkward. I'm not sure why the waiter just didn't say let me have them remake that instead of this weird output. Either way, I decided to give it another try. Yet again I was just disappointed. The selection of rolls is great but the staff is awful. I order something with lobster salad where the lobster was the hero of the roll and my boyfriend ordered another roll that had it in it. After ordering about 10 min later the wait comes back and tells my bf that they don't have any lobster salad and asked if he wanted something else, I then HAD TO ASK MYSELF what about my roll since the lobster salad is the main part of it? The waiter replied that my roll would still be fine, then I was like so it's basically the side parts of the roll with no main course and he thinks it'd be fine. Then he goes, do you not want yours? I'm like NO I don't because I ordered a lobster roll wanting the lobster. We ended up leaving because the other two rolls we wanted, they were also out of the main fish they needed for those as well. After these two terrible experiences, I will not go back. Tired of being treated as a customer that doesn't matter so I'll go to Sushi Ken just down the street to get better treatment.",

    "text": "Very impressed!  Serene decor, pleasant and attentive service, and a great happy hour menu will keep us dining at Ginban regularly.  Happy hour includes your favorite appetizers, sushi rolls, sashimi, and some saki specials.  Happy hour rolls are $3 to $5.  The full menu has many more sushi creations (try the Crazy Roll) and traditional meal choices.  Prices are very reasonable for the high quality of the food and service.  I recommend the Gyoza appetizer to start - a soft dumpling with a very good grilled flavor.  Nice selection of saki, beer, and drinks also.  I was happy they carry an IPA.  Lots of table seating and about 10 spots at the modern-style sushi bar.  There is good music playing in the background, and two flat screens at the sushi bar....enough to keep you entertained, yet still able to carry on a conversation with your sweetheart and friends.  We'll be back!",

    "text": "I enjoyed Ginban Sushi a great deal though I've only been there once. I split some nigiri, some sashimi, and a Spicy Girl Roll with another person and I enjoyed it all. The sashimi & nigiri was fresh, the Spicy Girl Roll was delicious, and another fabulous part of the dinner was the price. Having eaten in many of the sushi restaurants in the Chandler area, I can say that most are not as good and twice the price. The only reason I gave this place 4 stars was the unimpressive sake menu and the unpleasant service experience.  Our server knew nothing about sake and when I asked her which Specialty Roll she would recommend, she stated that she disliked raw fish and didn't really eat sushi. I'm rather sure that my mouth hung open for a few seconds after hearing that from a waitress in a sushi restaurant. All in all, I'd return to Ginban Sushi because I liked the sushi and it didn't break the bank.",

    "text": "So I finally got back to give this place a second try. Before they had just opened so I understood some of the flaws. Now it's been open about 2 years. Upon my second attempt at trying Ginban, I was again thoroughly disappointed. First flaw was the waiter, we could barely understand his mumbling. Second he didn't seem to even know the menu or inventory. We ordered the mango tango, and the king lobster roll, which both featured lobster salad, as we came just for those rolls (we love lobster, who doesn't). However we were informed a while after ordering that they were out of lobster salad (a good portion of their rolls feature this). Thirdly the menu descriptions are not accurate. The waiter wanted informed us about the lobster salad for the mango tango roll and not the king lobster roll. I had to dispute that the King Lobster roll has this as well, which is what the menu states. He then comes back saying that they don't really use it on the roll. Well then why is a King Lobster roll (I don't think the tempura lobster qualifies it as that). Also the menu did not list for one of our rolls had masago. And fourth the food was just meh and we left hungry and went to Sushi Ken down the road for an extra roll each. The Ginban roll, which should be the best since carrying their name, was subpar. This roll was supposed to be cooked, yet the tiny amount of salmon that was inside was raw. The snow something roll must of been called that because it tasted like the ingredients were frozen and not fresh. Other side notes: Ginban had only one other table filled, while just a mile down the road Sushi Ken was packed. When a customer orders their roll on soy paper, they need to be informed of it costing extra, since not every place charges extra. Again thoroughly disappointed and upon a second try, we will not be coming back.",

The atmosphere is much nicer than I expected, and would make a great date place. We ordered five different rolls; Phoenix, Tiger, Dynamite, Crunchy and Green Lady. The presentation of the dishes made them almost too beautiful to eat, and it was very apparent the chef here is an experienced sushi master. The prices of the dishes are also very reasonable, at $10-12 per plate. The one and only complaint I have is the price of the Sake bombs. At $13 each, I will not be buying drinks here (unless it's happy hour).",

When we walked in we got a table right away, it wasn't busy at all maybe a few people were there but that's it. The server came up and asked for our drinks right away. She was really nice as well! We had a big order so our food didn't come out until 20 min later which was fine.  I got the cold tofu appetizer, Alaska hand roll, Boston hand roll, bento box with chicken katsu and gyoza, and the king lobster specialty roll.  The hand rolls were really big! Very filling! Highly recommend!  The cold tofu sauce was a little bland and there was no Benito flakes on it, which it said it comes with.  The katsu tasted like really good chicken nuggets so I recommend getting that too!  The king lobster roll was just alright, that I don't highly recommend because you can't taste the lobster since it's deep fried!  But overall I would recommend this place to at least try it out because everyone has different experiences! And I just do happen to get a good one!",

    "text": "TLDR: Yikes. I know HH rolls are discounted, but I didn't think they'd be discounted in quality also. Tiny rolls that barely had any fish in them, when you pick up a piece and turn it upside down you only see rice!  ESSAY: Our salmon and tuna rolls barely had any fish in them. When I picked up each piece, I noticed the fish only showed on the top and not the bottom so that you can tell they barely put a teeny tiny piece of fish into each piece. Also, the seaweed used to wrap the sushi was so small that it didn't even completely cover the rice (see pics). Seriously this place isn't good at all unless you prefer to eat rolls that are basically rice wrapped with seaweed as there's almost no fish in there (they're more like a topping as you'd place a Hershey kiss at the top of a cookie).  Thankfully, we did not only order those two rolls. We also ordered salmon skin roll (mostly good except see close-up pic of end piece), Ginban roll (sizeable and pretty good), and crunchy calamari roll (also OK except for end piece). Those 3 were decent size and acceptable quality, but please don't order any rolls with just raw fish in it.  Service was pretty good hence 2 stars instead of 1. They asked and we were honest to tell them about the first 2 rolls, the waitress went to tell her lead or boss (also a lady) who came by and she said it's a new chef and that's why they weren't done right. To her credit, she brought ONE replacement salmon roll which was better but still not great, it was also bland. Don't think we're coming back.",

    "text": "Came here for the first time today and wow, what a disappointment. When I walked in the restaurant was completely empty (not a good sign when it's 5:15 pm and right in the middle of happy hour). I was greeted by a woman and sat at the sushi bar. I ordered a drink and she walked away. Never came back. Instead, she went to the host stand and began talking on the phone and taking multiple phone calls. She also proceeded to help someone else who came in to order a take out order. All of this happening while I sit here without my drink or even a water. Off to an awful start.   A man eventually took my order from behind the sushi bar and my drink appeared 10 minutes after I arrived. I ordered a house salad, edamame, salmon nigiri and a spicy salmon roll.   House salad: 1 star. Lettuce looked old and dry, dressing was very bland. I bit into what should have been a cucumber and it was zucchini. It was so squishy it completely dissolved when I bit it. I spit it out because I'm allergic to squash. I asked to return it and have it taken off the bill. The woman basically called me a liar and said \"it's cucumber\" grabbed the salad and angrily walked away.   Edamame: 1 star. I ordered the original off the HH menu but I was given some slimy, teriyaki flavored edamame. I ate a few of them, but again, very bland sauce.   Salmon nigiri: 2 stars. It was okay, decent size. The rice was way too warm and fell apart.   Spicy salmon roll: 2 stars. Small, bland, not spicy, the rice overpowered the roll, way too much.   Between the quality of food, mix up in the order and the poor service I would never return. There is WAY better sushi in the Ahwatukee area. Don't make the same mistake I did trying the place out on a whim. Even Sushi Ken blows this place out of the water... and that's not saying much.   ** I was inclined to give 1 star, but I gave two stars because the man behind the sushi counter was pretty nice and they didn't charge me for my edamame since they messed up.",

It sat on a littering of colorless shredded lettuce. However it tasted like it was fresh from the oven so no complaints but I wouldn't order it again. The rice in all the sushi was mushy. Loved the shrimp tempura but it was kind of bland. Everything was kind of bland actually but the salmon was fresh so it was good enough for me.

This weekend we ordered dinner from them via Doordash for our very hungry, very tired crew, for delivery.  45 minutes later the Doordash driver texted us saying that Ginban had not started our order yet, but they were about to and it would take 15 minutes. Half an hour after that the Doordash driver called us and said Ginban decided not to process our order because they were too busy.  Really?!?  You couldn't have told us that AN HOUR AGO when the order was received??  Why are you enrolled in Doordash if you are not prepared to honor the orders?    In short, they made us wait an unforgivable amount of time, with our driver literally sitting at the restaurant, only to tell us \"no food for you\".  We called to talk to the manager and instead of making it right they reiterated they would not process our dinner order.  So very disappointed.  Extremely poor customer service and the food is not stellar enough to make up for it.  We got our money back and will find another favorite Sushi restaurant.  There are many with great reviews.",

One of my co work and I ordered the bento box lunch, I had chicken teriyaki and he had beef teriyaki; I hate to say it, but it's probably the worst chicken teriyaki I have ever had in Arizona (so far).  I feel like I can cook better chicken teriyaki at home, it literally taste like the meat was microwaved and the teriyaki sauce was so light I can barely taste it.  I have been to Japan number of times, visited San Francisco Seattle New York Boston and more, even Minnesota have better bento boxes, and that state is no where near the ocean.  I gave it 2 stars because the sushi roll was okay. If you visit this place just for sushi I'll say go for it, it's not the best but it's fine.  One more thing, for the waitress who served us, I took 1 start off because of you. If a customer tell you that they don't like the food because it doesn't taste good, don't fight with them (like you did today), especially when they are the customer, just say I'm sorry you don't like it we will try to improve next time :)",

    "text": "I am not one to usually review but for the sake of others fooled to go in like I did due to currently having 4 stars I must warn those that actually like quality sushi.   We sat at the sushi bar. I ordered 2 rolls and boyfriend ordered Bento box teriyaki chicken with shrimp tempura as he is not a sushi fan which comes with salad, soup, California roll, and gyoza $16.  I then noticed some of the fish at the sushi bar were wrapped in paper towels!  That was a first. The restaurant was fairly empty so didn't expect to wait long for food or appetizers but it was 20 minutes before food arrived without the soup or salad. The waitress hadn't even stopped by in that time and had to be notified by the sushi chef (after WE informed him soup and salad we're missing).  She giggled embarrassed and said she forgot them. The sushi chefs did not interact with us the entire time (we were the only ones at the sushi bar) and did not even notice we were not served soup or salad before serving us our meals.   As far as food quality goes: Miso soup was subpar and bland in miso flavor.  Salad subpar in presentation and dressing taste/texture.  Teriyaki chicken very bland and subpar in flavor to even fast food teriyaki.  Shrimp tempura was rubbery and freezer burned flavor Rolls subpar due to bland flavorless rice and poor overall fish quality/taste.  I have never seen spicy tuna the color of bright red Koolaid in all my sushi experiences. (Pictured) Only decent thing about the place was the gyoza and clean environment.   So many better places and should not be rated as high as my two so far favorites Shimogamo or Hana.",

Also decided to go on a Sunday which happens to be happy hour all day! We got a ton to eat.. The sashimi was amazing, the rolls didn't disappoint, and the special rolls were fantastic. When the bill came, we were shocked to find it half of what we expected since most of what we ordered was on happy hour. Everything was fresh and the service was spot on.. Will certainly be back!",

Drinks were reasonably priced. Wait staff was very nice and friendly. Only negative is the ambiance is kind of boring, very open with not a lot of privacy if you are looking for a date night. If they would spice up the decor a bit I would give them 5 stars. Would return!",

Definitely one of those place that you \"don't judge a book by its cover\". The inside decor is beautifully set up.   Sushi is really good, love the fact they have a brown rice option that I can't get that at other places. The eel cucumber roll was pretty good for a light roll that will will not fill you up too much so, I think I might go for the eel avocado though next time I come. Also I'm pretty sure I fell in love the gyoza and the light dipping sauce that they have. Seriously it was cooked perfectly.  Will definitely come back again!",

I'm not sure what my expectations were but they were probably tainted by years of experience dining at mediocre sushi places in strip malls.  When you walk in you notice the really nice decor.  Stone walls, a nice long bar, dark colors...it's exactly what you wouldn't expect from the exterior.  As far as the food is concerned, it is really good.  The fish is super fresh, the rolls are very good, and the prices are completely reasonable.  It is easily the best sushi I've had in Ahwatukee.",

    "text": "There were multiple issues that arose during and after my experience with Ginban Sushi, but I will say that their food is excellent, but they CHANGED MY BILL AMOUNT WHEN THEY PROCESSED MY CARD. First of all, I'd like to say that restaurant was in no way busy when I walked in. There were 3 other parties there at the time, with a combined total of less then 10 people. Still, I called ahead and made a reservation for 6. I was told there would be a table for us when we got there. I arrived, and no one had put two tables together for us, so we had to wait for them to do it before we were seated.  When we finally sat down, we were given our menus and the waitress from the front went back to her post. At first our waitress came very quick to take our drink orders, but the snappy service soon diminished. I understand sushi takes a while, I've been to more then a few bars before in my life, but this seemed to take forever compared to other places. When we ordered, my sister ordered the same roll me and my grandmother ordered. We ordered three total, one each, and ordered it in such a way that her order was separate from ours. She was sitting on the complete other side of the table, and when the rolls came they were all on one plate. We had to pass the plate around to dish out the food.  Refills took forever. We were never offered any until the check was on it's way, and the waitress was never in the dining area so we were left with no drinks a lot of the time. Due to the poor service, I left a small tip. (On a bill of almost $80, I left $3 in cash). At first there was no issue with my receipt, and I walked out. After a few days, I noticed a charge posted to my bank account that was exactly 10% higher then what I wrote on the receipt. That's unacceptable. I never authorized a tip to be charged to my account. I went back and confronted the person claiming to be the manager on duty, who was ironically our server that day.  First she tried to say that they have a 10% minimum tip, but showed no proof of a sign or menu that said such when asked. Even if True, the $3 in cash should have been deducted. She then moved on to say that they charge a minimum 10% tip for all parties of six or more people due to the extra work like 'all fancy restaurants', but 'spared' us that charge. First of all, I was not spared this charge, it was folded into my bill. Secondly, I'm sorry but this is not a 'fancy' restaurant. Thirdly, our of the 6 people, 2 were under the age of 5 and one didn't even order anything. Her third and final excuse was that all sushi restaurants have a 10% minimum tip. During and after all this, I told her I was never told of the charge, I never authorized a charge of this amount, and that if they require higher tips to keep the restaurant going, they should raise prices on the menu, not up people's bill without them knowing. It was not until I threatened to go to the city with a case of fraud that she begrudgingly offered a higher amount in store credit for our problems. I declined, because after making a threat like that I don't know what they'll do. I told her I just want a refund for the amount that I didn't authorize (almost $8). She kept going back and offering store credit time and time again until she finally took down our card number and receipt info to find the transaction and refund the amount.  What's even more troublesome is at some point they put through a second charge on my bank account for the actual amount that I wrote on the receipt, but it never posted. The first charge of the amount plus 10% is what did post. Never going here again. Terrible service, and fraudulent charges that were never stated when we walked in or ordered. For those who made it this far, yes I did end up getting my $8 after almost a week.",

After multiple friends telling us that we had to try this spot again (even though I said that we \"never\" would) we gave it another try. It was spot on. The kid loved her Chicken Katsu. The hubby had some kind of roll and asked for no cucumber and avocado (God forbid he ate something green) and that was no issue for them like it is in some restaurants. They also split some gyoza and calamari and it was gobbled up very quickly. And for those of you looking for a Keto/Low Carb option check out the Lollipop roll (no rice). I will tell you I am a little tired of sashimi while eating low carb when I go out to sushi, but this was a really awesome option for me. The service was good, the food was good, the Happy Hour prices were good and we will be back. They deliver too (not sure how I feel about sushi being delivered in the AZ desert heat, but who knows - never say never with this place is one thing that I have learned).",

    "text": "I had a hankering for sushi tonight and visited Ginban for the first time with my husband tonight. My experience was similar to what many others commented on here already. The service was, frankly, below average. We were greeted and seated immediately, but it took over 15 minutes for our order to be taken. I wasn't sure if the restaurant was short-staffed, or the servers just didn't stop by our table enough, but either way, I was nearly ready to walk out after our main server walked by our table several times without so much as a glance to us. She was not very friendly, either.  However, I'm really glad we stayed as the sushi was outstanding. I had a Philadelphia roll and a roll with crab, and my husband and I shared a sweet potato tempura roll. My husband doesn't like fish, so he ordered chicken teriyaki as well. The sushi was excellent--the fish was fresh and flavorful, and the sweet potato was the perfect texture and temperature. My husband's chicken teriyaki was a bit dry and chewy, though the portion of chicken and rice was large. The teriyaki sauce could also have used a bit more flavor.  We'll be moving to downtown Phoenix in a few weeks, so I'm not sure if I'll be back. If we weren't moving, it would always be a good option for sushi, especially with Happy Hour all day on Sundays (see their menu for great HH pricing). The service and wait time really put me off, but the great sushi can't be denied.",

    "text": "My fiance and I moved to the area right before Ginban opened, so I've been curious to try it.  I'm so glad we did!  They've only been open 3 weeks, so there weren't many people inside but I'm hoping they're able to build a good customer base to stay open.  The atmosphere/decor was closer to something you would see in Scottsdale but not obnoxiously so.  They still have a couple kinks to work out - we had a waitress, but the sushi chef took our order (they don't have the traditional paper menus at most sushi restaurants) and the waitress didn't know that.  However, I think because we were sitting right in front of him at the bar he just took care of us.  We ordered yellowtail sashimi, the pikachu roll and the spicy girl roll.  The sashimi was delicious, although I was a little taken aback that it was served in a margarita glass over crushed ice and the glass changed color.  In my opinion, that part wasn't necessary.  My fiance really enjoyed the spicy girl roll - the crunchies mixed in with the spicy salmon on top were a nice addition and overall the roll had a good spice to it.  The pikachu roll was unlike any other roll I've had before - it has lobster salad, bbq eel, avocado and tempura banana.  Yes, banana.  All of this wrapped in soybean paper and drizzled with eel sauce.  We wolfed it - it was so good.  I would say it was a delicious way to end the meal, but we also tried their tempura green tea ice cream.  Also quite tasty, and the sushi chef said they made the ice cream in house.  I really hope this place sticks around - we look forward to coming back!",

The Sashimi entree was a site to be seen...sliced raw yumminess served in a bowl over ice with lots of decorative touches, including a multicolored disco light that shined through the ice.  The roll was quite tasty too.  One of our servers (we had several who took care of our table...not sure which one actually got the tip) gave us some the non-pasty wasabi (more fresh) to taste...that was a nice addition.

    "text": "If you've been going somewhere else for sushi then what the heck are you doing?!  You're going to the wrong place ya big dungus!  Ginban sushi is the place to go and let me tell you why.  I've been here over a dozen times now and that's a lot of times considering I've only been in the area for like 8 months.  Before I came to Phoenix I've been all over the world and I've eaten sushi meats from coast to coast and let me tell you something - I don't know a lot about sushi but I know when I put something in my mouth if it tastes good or not, and that's why I'm writing this review because if you want some sushi meats that you put in your mouth and you like the way it tastes then just come here, what are you waiting around for?!  First let me tell you about the owner, ok?  He's a great guy and he's a sushi master.  The menu has a lot of great sushis on it.  Maybe you want some rolls, right?  Well then what the heck - just get one of the rolls with banana tempura in it and you're gonna love it!  Or maybe you want some fresh fish so just order some fish or ask them what they recommend and he'll give you the best that he recommends.  I don't know why I have to explain this to you, just do it already.  Or maybe you're a guy and you're like \"Oh I don't want some sushi because I like cooked food\" ok then big man, just order off of the kitchen menu and they'll bring you some sushi meats cooked and some rice and some tempura shrimp or whatever you order, it doesn't matter because it's all good.  Ok finally maybe you're here already and you're looking at Yelp because it's time for desert.  And maybe you're at Ginban with your special lady and it's a romantic evening, so you want to know how to close things our and seal the deal (Ladies this is a good place to take your man also if you want him to know that you're the boss and you wear the pants when it comes to picking where to eat and you're not going to settle for Wendy's or Taco Bell anymore) so just listen to me and do what I tell you: order the mango salad, and a peach saki for desert, and share it.  The Mango Salad isn't on the menu and I hope the owner doesn't get pissed about me saying it, but order it anyway.  I don't know how much is costs all I know is that it's real sushi (like maybe it's crab salad and tuna salad inside of a mango wrap) and it's delicious and it's real food, not some fru-fru desert that a gypsy tries to sell you when it's checkout time at an Italian restaurant.  And the peach saki is the perfect sweet way to end the meal so that when you give that goodnight kiss you taste like peach and not like whatever else you ate, and just have a good time, ok?  Because it's a great place to eat some sushi.  Stop going somewhere else you're wasting your money and you look like a big dringus!  Look at the pictures that's actually what the food looks like and it tastes as good as it looks!",

I don't think I would be back just bc the last time I came, the restaurant was full; instead of telling me they were full and behind, they took me in. There were only 2 sushi chefs and 3 waiters and the table were full. All of the restaurants that I've been to, they would tell me how long the wait would be so that I have a choice to leave or to wait. This place happily took my party in and it took them 2 hours to complete my order. I feel like I get each order every half hour. No food is worth that kind of waiting time.",

The chicken clearly is not cooked there, it tastes like it is precooked from us foods and thawed out. The Katsu sauce is not Japanese at all.   I guess if you only want sushi it's ok, but the fish is average. The service is quick but not very engaging.",

I live in Ahwatukee and have never seen so many sushi restaurants in 1 square mile in my life! so when this spot opened, I stopped by a few weeks ago out of curiosity. (the coupon in the mail helped too).   t's GORGEOUS inside. These folks really take pride in their NEW restaurant. I mean...you should see the bathroom... It's the nicest bathroom I have ever seen with floor to ceiling granite tile and one of those fancy sinks you only see in a swanky resort.   We ordered the jalapeno appetizer and a few other items which were all fantastic and well-priced. The staff was polite and attentive as we dined at about 8pm on a weeknight and of course there were few patrons.  When you want sushi, a fine-dining atmosphere and great service without the Scottsdale prices, go here!",

The place was a little small, but very clean and nice. I came after the typical dinner rush, so there was no wait and the food came out quickly. Our server was exceptional. Since they have a lot of roll options, she gave us recommendations - which were all amazing! Our drinks never went empty and I was really happy with the amount of roll pieces served (and the amount of rice was also perfect). Oh, and you can have your sushi made with brown rice instead - score!   I am really happy I tried this place and will definitely come back and recommend to others.",

We ordered the sashimi deluxe, and since it happened to be happy hour we also ordered a ginban roll, spicy salmon roll, and seaweed salad.  The sashimi deluxe included seven different kinds of sashimi, three pieces of each kind.  The quality was average for Arizona-- a couple of the pieces did not taste very fresh.  However, the price fit with the quality as it was only $24.  The ginban roll was similar to what you get at asian fusion restaurants; the spicy salmon roll was below average; the seaweed salad was above average.    The service was average.  There was only one server working.  She checked up on us periodically, but was not very friendly.  The atmosphere was nice for a date, although it was very quiet (almost too quiet).  There were three other couples eating while we were there.  Overall, I would eat here again--but it would not be my first choice.",
