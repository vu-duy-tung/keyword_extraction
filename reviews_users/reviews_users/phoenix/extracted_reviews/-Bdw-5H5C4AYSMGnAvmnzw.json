I was shocked the first time I made a reservation too, but seeing that our bill (without drinks) is usually around $25 - $30 per person I don't have a problem pre paying. Not being a large restaurant if a few groups don't show for up for their reservations that affects larger percentage of tables and other possible customers. If I'm able to make a reservation because others who wouldn't show up for their's don't make one, then I'm happy.",

My car is slammed to the floor and I cannot make it up the driveway across the street. So I parked in the street. As soon as I walked in I was not greeted I was told, by who must have been the manager, I should have parked somewhere else. Which really didn't make me feel too happy. The food was great. The server was teally busy but that's understandable. The food was great we had the pasta nachos. They were really good. While we were finishing up we noticed our sever had asked the people next to us to leave due to other people waiting to be seated. Which surprised me. I wouldn't think that's top notch service. The space is very limited. It can maybe hold 30 people at a time. Had it not been for the experience from the staff it would be a 5 star review.",

Its just the cutest, classiest, coziest, most welcoming establishment.  Makes you feel like you could spend hours upon hours there.  Our waiter/bartender was fantastic and I wish I caught his name.  The bar was full so we sat in the 'reading room' .... couches and chairs sectioned off from the bar and restaurant by bookshelves.    Although we were not there to eat, the entire place smelled SO GOOD and the food looked wonderful.  I can't wait to go back there for dinner!",

Yeah, Ginger Ale and Fried Cheese Curds...  Hmm, I probably shouldn't have written this...",

    "text": "The difference between 4 and 5 stars, in my opinion, is the little things that make a restaurant just over the top. Tuck Shop has that, in spades.   We've been meaning to try the place since we saw it on some TV show last summer, and finally on a random Saturday night took the plunge.  At 6:15 the place was already packed, with a 45 minute wait for a table for two. Luckily, the host (John, I believe the owner?) suggested sitting at the  bar, which was open. The bar has nifty hooks for a lady's purse right under the counter (so the purse doesn't touch the floor) which made my wife smile.  Laura, the bartender, immediately made sure we felt very much at home with a friendly and very attentive attitude as we ordered, easily answering the questions of all the bar patrons.  My wife's smile got a lot larger as we ordered non-alcoholic drinks: I had iced tea (the Republic of Tea's darjeeling in a bottle, but only $3) and she had Ginger Ale: house-made from real ginger, with tonic water and lime. It was FANTASTIC, wow!  Based on the TV show, we first had the beer-battered cheese curds, which were quite tasty - peppery with a great light cheese flavor, and just enough for a taste for both of us for $4.  We then ordered two items off the \"smaller plates\" portion of the menu  -- think of them as appetizers. They are a bit pricy ($9 each) but two of them would make a nice little meal.   First was the stuffed mejool dates with chorizo. I would never have thought of the combination, but they were truly delicious! Served on a bed of arugula that had a great lemon tang, the arugulu really added to the flavor of the dates instead of just being a throw-away bed of greens.  Next was another TV Show mention, the Times Mac & Cheese. Very very good! A bit of spice and good high-end cheese choices made my wife's smile grow into tasty little yummy noises.  By now, we knew we'd be back.  We then decided to split a main course (the menu calls them \"for sharing\" but I'd call it a single person entree, in the $20 range): the pork chop with kugel (noodles) and salsa verde. The chop was perfectly cooked, and the salsa verde was clearly homemade and very very good. I'd have liked a bit more of the salsa and less of the sour cream, but thats really personal taste. The kugel was an interesting side and was good.  Finally, we decided to split the peach cobbler for desert. As you'll probably expect by now, it was excellent, with a nice cinnamon flavor with tasty homemade whipped cream and biscuit.  All in all, a fabulous meal for a decent price: Laura the bartender helped make this a great meal we've already talked to friends about going back!",

    "text": "**for whatever's it's worth here's my very old, unfinished...Tuck Shop Review:   After several loopy-de-loops and a quick text to Google Find, our little group of three happily found the charming neighborhood Tuck Shop, last night after the Luna Festival.   This is a place where you can go and feel welcomed and familiar. A place where the food is not over-seasoned and the service is friendly and attentive. While the atmosphere, music, low light and cool mini art gallery makes you relaxed...the food service was prompt.   At Tuck Shop, they've embraced the sharing concept, which is what probably excited my companions the most. I am one that normally does not enjoy sharing my food in equal portions...you may have a bite, but the rest is all mine!   Although we did not sit at the bar, we appreciated the detail of purse hooks under the counter. And noted both the casual choice of miscellaneous dining chairs ....   (**please note, this review was started in march of 2009...prior to finding out I was pregnant. Needless to say, I forgot all about this review in progress and now may 2011, it's been so long since I ate here, that I can't even remember what exactly we ate. But, I definitely remember I enjoyed the food, whatever it was! ...loved the vibe of the place and I'd love to venture back to phoenix just to try it again, so that I can give a proper review and see if it can keep it's 4 stars from me.)",

    "text": "We went to Tuck Shop the other night and wowser! The food is fricking delicious. So we started with the chicory salad, which was amazing. I am still day dreaming about the roasted hazelnuts and squash. We then devoured the dates stuffed with chorizo and cheese. It tastes exactly what it sounds like and it goes so well together. On to the larger sharing plate of chicken and waffles . . . this was simply heavenly. The meat of the chicken was so juicy and tender and the nice hue of rosemary and citrus was just perfect. The cheddar infused waffle was light and fluffy and gave the crust of the waffle a nice cheesy taste. The best part was the maple gravy-like syrup, which was something I have never experienced. Both of us were in silence and trying to savor every bite.   I forgot to mention the fabulous drink specials Tuesday through Thursdays. I knew the moment I saw all their mixed drinks with ginger ale that I was going to love this place. I could have drank spiced rum and ginger ale and the \"dark and stormy\" all night.   I love the idea of sharing plates because you get a variety without getting uncomfortably full. I wish a lot more restaurants had this concept. The ambiance was simple and cute with each table having purposeful mismatched chairs. My partner noticed that the seats of all the chairs were the same, which was a very smart design for equality of comfort. Tuck Shop you get all 5 stars for taste, selection, and ambiance.",

Every item we ordered delivered 100% for flavor, presentation and freshness.  We LOVED the cheese curds, smooth creamy and just a hint of the batter flavor to round things out NO dipping necessary, they are perfect just the way God made 'em.   Red Beans & Rice was Spousal Unit's favorite - the smoke from the sausage and the zesty sauce in the dish had so much personality, adding grilled shrimp perfectly done was a bonus.

I felt compelled to say something since i usually don't.  After telling the server he took the initiative to tell the \"boss\" , they immediately comped it.  I was so surprised since something so \"common sense seems to be not so common in this city.  Of course we over tipped the amount of the comp.  J  I am a fan.  The space itself looks awesome.

The bar tender introduced herself as Grace and told me she was one of the owners.  I wasn't feeling a traditional Mimosa so she asked me a few questions about what I liked and she made me the most awesome cocktail.   When my party arrived we were seated promptly.  The server was very good at suggesting shared plates for the group.  Since there were 5 of us we opted for the French Toast plate that came with 5 pieces of French Toast with an apple compote and whipped cream.  It was delicious.  Everyone ordered a Brunch item off the menu.  I had the Chicken and Waffles that consisted of 3 big, well seasoned, pieces of chicken with a somewhat savory waffle and eggs.  It was a lot of food, but, I loved it.  Others ordered the Crab Benedict which they said was also very good.

Every dish was fantastic, starting with cheese curds that were a perfect mix of sweet and salty and chorizo stuffed dates, which paired amazingly well.  For entrees I got the chicken and waffles - the cheddar waffle tasted more like a cheese biscuit than a waffle, but it was a worthy partner to the crispy fried thigh, leg and breast that came with the meal.  Where do they find breasts this big?  The breading was so crunchy you could literally knock on it. My wife got the pork loin which was super flavorful and came with some bomb bacon jam.  And both dishes were accompanied with some excellent charred veggies.  Finally, we finished with an amazing bread pudding that had an intense whiskey flavor.  I don't think there was any sugar in the cream, so you could stir it into the sauce and get exactly the right flavor to your own taste.  Definitely a winner and going back.",

The food is simply delicious. I've had the tacos, the rack of lamb, the shop salad, and the pork belly so far... all of them leaving my tummy and mouth smiling. Last time I went I smelled the ribs...getting those next! They have creative cocktails and a wonderful wine list. Fine dining at a reasonable price and beautiful locale.",

    "text": "I went to dinner here last night with my bf. We have lived in Phoenix for over a year now and had only heard about this place 2 days ago. Needless to say that when a fellow foodie tells you about a great place, you go there the next night.  We started with the cheese curds and the grilled baguette with the roasted garlic & olive oil. The curds were salty and savory while the bread with roasted garlic was subtle but delicious. I ended up combining both appetizers (putting the cheese on top of the garlic spread with the bread) and it made it perfect: salty, garlicky, and wonderful.  My bf had the Pine AZ spiced steak with mashed potatoes. He let me have a bite of each and the steak was tender, juicy, and flavorful. The potatoes were creamy but lacked depth in my opinion.   I had the Beet Crudo Ravioli and the Gnocchi for my main course. The gnocchi was fluffy with a delicate outer crunch; the cheese sauce it came with was delicious. Like everything in life, more cheese sauce is appreciated. Now the beet crudo ravioli was on a whole other level. The beets in combination with the cheese filling and the cold gazpacho-like sauce was insanely good. I ate that dish slowly, savoring every bite.   We were planning on ordering the creme brulee for dessert but the owner, Grace, beat us to it and delivered it to us on the house. It was rich and creamy with the lovely sugar crust on top. It was so nice of her to do that and made regular customers out my bf and I.  Honestly, this place is amazing. From the cozy atmosphere to the reasonable prices to the effort that's evidently put into each dish...I don't understand how I, as a foodie, had not heard of it until now. But I'm so glad I did and we'll be back for more!",

    "text": "This place definitely exceeded my expectations. We walked in on a Friday night at about 6:30p with no reservations and was told the entire dining room was booked until 9p. However, we had a choice of the bar or the \"living room\" with couch style seating. We chose the only two bar seats left.   The menu was very diverse from appetizers to desserts. There is a small plate section that is more tapas style and then a normal entree size section. Although the cheese curds did sound appealing, we chose to start with the zucchini planks and Sonoran pigs-in-a-blanket for our appetizers. Both of which were definitely far better than even the description made them sound. Their specialty cocktails were equally as impressive with hand crafted ingredients that were mixed together perfectly. If you like tequila, the No. 18 is a must try!   For the entree I ordered the filet mignon and it was cooked to perfection with an amazing red wine glaze. It came with frites as a side and a house made truffle aioli. My fiance got the pork tenderloin with bourbon bacon jam and it was also cooked and seasoned perfectly. Although we opted not to get dessert, the bill came with two raw cookie dough balls. That was an absolutely perfect finish for an amazing meal.",

Tuck Shop is a great spot, tucked away in a neighborhood, and full of delicious seasonal food. They not only have a rotating menu, but an extensive wine list and create their own syrups in-house for cocktails.   Their mac n cheese (WITH LOBSTER OBVIOUSLY) is incredible. Their simple, yet tasty, roasted garlic is always a must with me as well. Salads are top notch, daily specials always mouth watering, and it's just a warm atmosphere to be a part of.   The manager is supremely nice and recognizes you after just one visit. Every waiter I've had has been the picture of great service and I can't think of one bad dish I've been served. Parking can sometimes be a bit tricky, but there is a large lot across the street that you can use. It's a great place to take out-of-towners, a date, or your parents.",

Stuffed Medjool Dates is worth every dollar and I had one of Vovo's Favorites, which was a fish dishwith mango-like sauce and risotto or polenta or something like that. Whatever it was, it was good.

I had the chocolate cake at the end last time, and it was so mouthwateringly good. I just didn't get it this time because I ate so much I was almost in pain.   This is a great place for a date night.

We shared each dish & still had leftovers to bring home! Definitely recommend making a reservation, seating is very limited.   We started with the Zucchini Planks. (I love anything zucchini!!) They were lightly breaded, flash fried to perfection with a lemon dipping aioli that was fantastic. We shared the Baby Lettuce Salad (sounds boring, but that goddess dressing - yum!!) For our entree, we split the Chicken & Waffles with a small plate of Mac & Cheese. We were totally impressed with the meal. Three HUGE pieces of chicken that were golden fried served with fluffy waffle quarters & string beans. Definitely enough to share. And the Mac & Cheese? Topped with bacon & filled with gooey cheese sauce, it was heavenly.   Prices were on point, the whole meal with drinks for the two of us was under $55. We will definitely be back again... With the daily specials I can't wait to try what's next!",

    "text": "The restaurant is a nice surprise in the middle of Coronado. You don't really expect something so nice there. They have a lovely full bar that would be nice to sit at and just have a couple drinks. The service was very attentive and great. My beef was with the food. The prices are a little steep but I guess you are paying for the ambience, and the portions are small.   My brother and I had happy hour cocktails, the baguette with roasted garlic, the shrimp piri piri, the surf and turf special, and the banana bread desert. Their happy hour goes from 5-6 and their signature cocktails are $5. I got a tasty bourbon drink and my brother got a (non-happy hour) vodka tonic. They make their own tonic there, which I give them props for, but my brother said it tasted weird and was too sweet for a tonic.   The shrimp was ok. The piri piri was not very flavorful and there were only about 5 small shrimp and an abundance of pita tips. This was more like a small appetizer then a small meal. The roasted garlic with the baguette was good but I can't believe that they charge for bread and call it an appetizer. The surf & turf special was a really fatty ribeye steak with even smaller shrimp on top, soggy yellow rice and french fries. We asked for medium and got very rare (but at least it wasn't over cooked, I guess). If you're paying $30 for a 4-6 ounce steak, the meat to fat ratio should be a little higher and it should be cooked right. The moist and plentiful banana bread desert was probably the best part of the meal.  I went in here really wanting to love this place but I probably would only come back for drinks and desert. To their credit, the restaurant is well decorated and they have great service.",

The whole thing has a very modern feel to it right down to the food, which consists of small and larger (sharable) plates.  The food is just fantastic.  I recommend the following:  Cheese Curds: a light snack to start off and they are AMAZING. Brussels Sprouts: I don't like Brussels sprouts but I like these Brussels sprouts. Shrimp Po-Boys: Fantastic Chicken& Waffles: LoLo's it is not but the fried chicken is delicious.  It's more of a Italian style than a southern one: light and crisp, not battered and fatty, but delicious for sure. Lamb Meatballs: Really exceptional; don't pass these up  I wasn't as blown away by the mac and cheese as others seem to be.  Maybe this is worth a try though but it wasn't my thing.  The drinks are also excellent.  All of them are thoroughly homemade.  They make one of the best Dark & Stormy's ever.  GO NOW!",

They directed us next door to Astor House where we could have some drinks and appetizers, so that's what we did.  There, we ordered the gumbo appetizer, which turned out to be the size of a full-on entree for two.  That filled us up, but after waiting for all that time for a table at Tuck Shop we were reluctant to just leave it at that, thus more eating ensued once we finally got a table.  We ordered the salmon hand pie, which was good but not great.  I also wanted to try to stuffed medjool dates which I heard a lot about here on yelp, but was left disappointed.  My boyfriend ordered the skirt steak which was delicious.  Luckily we didn't order dessert because we got one for free when we got our check.

We had to do the cheese curds, always a favorite...and the new pigs in a blanket with Schreiner's sausage.  OMG.  Entrees - I often gravitate back to the chicken and waffles.  SO good.  Hubs had the BBQ ribs and he cleaned his plate!  The four of us had two bottles of Simple Life Pinot Noir, another standby.  Little cookie dough bites still there for a sweet treat since we had no room for dessert....though they sounded heavenly!  Love that we can make reservations now.  Thanks John and crew for another great meal!!",

We were a group of 6 that because of the change in time with our reservation, some had to cancel. The unpleasant part (and the missing star) is that the owner will stare at us every time as if it was our fault. To enjoy better this place DON'T go with a group larger than 4.   We had the fried noodles and yes, the salsas are worth trying. The bread with garlic is something I wouldn't order for it's price, but my friend enjoyed it. I shared a chicken and waffle with one of my friends and gladly this portion was more than enough. I wouldn't fry that chicken. It is cooked in a good way and the meet is really tasty, the breeding comes like a crust and it becomes too much.   The other dish that was tried is the mac & cheese. I really can't understand who orders this in a restaurant. My friend was a bit disappointed as he was dreaming of crispy prosciutto (never heard about this) and for him it was too tender.    We also tried the rum and ginger ale, YES! try it! If there is a next time, I'll make sure I don't have a reservation so we can eat and enjoy our dinner.",

The portabella melt is served on generic wheat bread (think Nature's Own or something like you would get at the grocery store.) The side of quinoa/rice salad was overwhelmed by the taste of red onion to the point that I could not eat it. The portabella had great flavor but I wish there had been more it. The cantaloupe with salt and a drizzle of olive oil was surprisingly good.  Was the food bad? Overall, no. However, I left hungry and not feeling like it was worth the $45 we paid (with tip) for two entrees.",

I was delighted because they still had plenty of small plate options that were awesome! We had the roasted garlic ($6) which is a whole head of garlic and some grilled bread-- amazing! We also had a potato gnocchi that was fried with some sort of cream sauce on top. They were like little tater tots from heaven. Finally, we had the beet crudo ravioli, which admittedly we didn't understand even after our server explained it to us - but it was a creative, delicious dish.  Some of the less than stellar reviews made me nervous to try this restaurant on date night, but I'm so glad we did. It was a unique Phoenix experience, and I look forward to going back again!",

We were seated promptly and our waitress was friendly and attentive.   We ordered the chorizo stuffed dates, Mac and cheese, taco salad, and cheese curds. The cheese curds was my favorite! The Mac and Cheese and taco salad weren't bad at all, but I was not a fan of the chorizo stuffed dates. I took one bite and couldn't finish the date. In my opinion, the spicy chorizo and the sweetness of the dates was not a great combination. Hubby also ordered a beer. Total of bill: around $46 plus tip.   Overall, we enjoyed our dinner and the service was fantastic!",

I read that they had recently started opening for brunch on weekends and I finally made a visit.   We were quickly greeted and we requested to sit at the bar. Their drink menu (at least during brunch) is limited. Wine, beer, a $9 mimosa or a $10 Bloody Mary were the only options. This is where it lost a star for me. A little more variety would have been nice. I went with the Bloody Mary which was pretty good.   As for the food, this is why I will come back again and again. My boyfriend had the salmon and eggs and just, wow. The smoked salmon melts in your mouth and is so flavorful! It was amazing. I had the pork belly benedict and it was perfect. The pork belly again just melts in your mouth, the hollandaise was probably the best I've ever tasted. The chef clearly takes pride in his craft and made a point to check in with us to see how we liked it.   The customer service was also top notch. This was our first time there, yet all the staff talked with us like we were regulars which made us feel right at home. The ambiance is nice too, with a little reading nook and couches, as well as tables. It had an upscale feel, yet casual enough that it didn't seem stuffy.   I don't remember our total bill, but I do remember feeling that the price was very reasonable for the quality of food and service. I really hope I'll get a chance to return in the evening when hopefully their craft cocktail menu is available.",

When we called earlier in the week to asked about bringing decorations to surprise my sister for her birthday we somehow confused the person we spoke to and the reservation got changed to a brunch instead.  When we showed up, they weren't prepared to present \"tea\" as they normally do. Within minutes, they bent over backwards to have a beautiful table set up for my sister and plenty of options to make her birthday memorable and keep our surprise party special and fun! Afterwards, they offered to hand wrap our taper candles that we brought in butcher paper so we could reuse them at home. Then, they presented my sister with a lovely teacup and saucer that they had gift wrapped for her. They helped carry our decorations to and from the car and were incredibly kind and welcoming of us into this beautiful space. The food was really delightful and the presentation was magical. We had such a fantastic time!",

Our most recent visit was to celebrate my brother's birthday. We easily booked a reservation for 6 through Yelp and arrived with no issues.  For appetizers we ordered the Mac n cheese, the garlic toast, and tuna tare tare - all of which were very good.  As entree our table consisted of the ribs, the chicken and waffles, the shop salad, the pine steak, and the portobello mushroom.  You can't get much better than any of the items we ordered. The only item that wasn't a hit was the portobello, but that was my mom's, and she doesn't seem to ever love anything. I'll chalk that one up as her being picky.  Also cool, I ordered the chicken and waffles and since we were friendly (I assume) or since we were spending a good amount of money, they gave me a special limited addition Whistle Pig syrup and that Whistle Pig only sends to select bars who use a lot of their whiskey. The syrup was fantastic and the gesture of offering it was even cooler. Whistlepig happens to be one of the my favorites.  Service was outstanding as usual.",

I had several servers just stop by to chat and see how the food was the staff was so endearing and each had a story to tell about something we were eating. Loved the excitement and joy the servers had which is rare especially during the holiday season. We had the chicken and waffles and the steak and sweet potato fritters. Talk about decadent!! Will be back for more...great date spot or just a night of great food and booze.",

The bartender answered the phone when I called and was very friendly and helpful in giving directions.  She was also the first to welcome me as I walked in the door.    I sat at the bar while I waited for my date to arrive.  She recommended at great beer from San Diego - maybe one of the best beers I've had in a long time!  My date arrived and we were seated immediately.  We ordered vodka martinis and the brussels sprout app right away.  We later tried three of the small plates - gnocchi, tacos, and chorizo dates along with some wine.  Everything was amazing and the service was fast and very friendly.  The food here is incredible!  I can't wait for my next visit.    Verdict:  HIGHLY RECOMMEND.",

I think to myself about how many delicious meals I could have had here, while instead eating elsewhere.  I went to this restaurant on Saturday night, and was seated almost instantly.  It was a full restaurant and the ambiance was incredible.  The staff was extremely friendly and more importantly very knowledgeable.  For the first time in a very long while I met someone, Grace, who happened to know as much about Bourbon, Scotch, and Whiskey as I do.  She was great to talk to and learn about their liquors and why they have specific ones.  The food portion or our experience was even better than the Whiskey, which I don't say much.  I had the Pork Loin with some onion rings on the side, and the table also had the Pine Steak.  Both meals were exceptional and I would recommend either one as a main course.  We also ordered Beet Ravioli, Cheese Curds, and Zucchini Planks, all of which were perfectly done.  This is a must try, and I promise you will be back again and again.",

An interesting way of doing things.  Our meal was average to good. We got a pulled pork slider, lasagna nachos or something along those lines, mac and cheese. Nothing was AMAZING, but the lasagna nachos were really good. They also gave us an amazing dessert on the house, it was like a cheesecake brownie and my girlfriend and I didn't make it to the car without splitting half of it. The location kind of sneaks up on you because it's in a quiet neighborhood. The service was great.",

I'm usually not a fan of mac and cheese but being a lobster junkie this was very satisfying.  Stuffed Mejool Dates ($11) - The dates are overwhelmingly sweet and did somehow compliment the savory flavors of the gruyere cheese and chorizo. This dish was very overpowering in taste and while it was an interesting combination, I'm not sure if I would order it again.   Pine AZ Spiced Steak ($23) - Nothing special, just a steak with a few slices of sauteed mushroom.  We had our meal to go and not sure if take out orders are smaller but the lobster mac and cheese came in a small cardboard box, there were only 4 stuffed mejool dates and a tiny portion of the steak with a meager amount of sauteed mushrooms.   Good meal but a ripoff, I didn't feel like the meal was worth ~50 dollars.",

    "text": "My wifey and I came here last night.   I had seen this while browsing through for some place good to eat since I didn't want to go to Macaroni Grill or Outback.   Parking was lacking but I guess it's fitting for a place that can probably fit like only two dozen people. There's additional parking across the street like a stone's throw away and I guess you could always try parking along the street.  We came in and the first thing I saw...young female hipsters, ha. Turned my head and saw a Ipad laying there and was like, \"I knew it!\" Nonetheless, I figured, this place will be interesting.   The interior was actually pretty nice. Small, maybe like two dozen people could be in here but it was nice. There was wood paneling. The lights were dimmed to set a cozy, intimate environment with some light music playing the background.   We were seated fast and got glasses of water and a menu fast. We looked at the menu. Their beverage menu is alright, befitting a cozy hole in the wall with some choice drafts and some decent wine. She had moscato. I didn't feel like drinking soda or alcohol so I kept my water.   The prices were alright. Decent on the entrees but a little more than expected on the appetizers.   We had got the cheese curds which were good (They're not Wisconsin good but still pretty decent) and garlic baguettes served with a herb roasted garlic clove and olive oil for spread which, was delicious. Here's where you can definitely tell this place is very good for dates...the Entrees portion was called \"For Sharing...\". They give you decent enough portions to share amongst two people. Very nice. We picked out the rib eye since my lady was craving red meat (lol, no pun). I got a small brisket taco on the side which came with a guacamole with a slight kick to it. It's no Thai hot but had a decent kick to it.  The taco was actually stacked pretty high with brisket meat and some minced vegetables. It was VERY good. The rib eye came with a side of grilled carrot brochettes and baby potatoes. She really liked the carrots. Dessert was two FREE cookie dough balls with chocolate drizzle.  Frankly, I thought everything was good. The only reason why I gave four stars instead of five was because my lady disliked our server's speed in service. My lady had remarked that there wasn't many people here and we still had to wait a more than reasonable amount of time and our server was just chatting. I saw but thought nothing of it but the woman is always right...never argue, ever. It's too cold to sleep on the couch these nights. Other than that, I figured this place is worth a visit and I wouldn't mind coming back again.",

    "text": "Where to start... How about the fact that they make their own mixers! Tonic water, ginger ale, sour mix, lemonade. Literally all made from scratch. And if that doesn't sell you, this will:  My man and I started with the cheese curds and baguette for apps. If you love cheese as much and my boyfriend and I do, then the curds are a do-not-miss. But the baguette? Oh man, it was insane. It came with a whole roasted garlic that had been stuffed with herbs and spices, and the roasting made the garlic spreadable almost like a butter. It was literally drool-worthy.   Next, he got the steak and I got the pork tenderloin and we both split the Mac & cheese. The seasoning on the steak was perfection, and the garlic mashed potatoes it came with were a perfect pairing. The Mac and cheese was pretty good. I'm a sucker for anything that includes prosciutto, but I'll admit they were a bit too runny for my taste. But the pork! Let me tell you about this pork! You could cut the thing with a butter knife. I know. I tried. It was the most unbelievably tender tenderloin I think I've ever had.   They ended the meal on a very high note... Instead of giving you boring, run-of-the-mill dinner mints, they excite your sweet tooth with a ball of cookie dough drizzled in chocolate. When I was looking through the pics on Yelp I thought this was a dessert option on the menu. Imagine my delight when these little balls of sugary heaven showed up on my plate FO' FREE!  I loved this place. The food, the atmosphere, the fact that it's in a house that was re-structured just for the restaurant. Everything about it I loved. Definitely a must-go if you're in the Phoenix area.",

Ohh the food!  It was unique, very tasty and fun! I loved the brussel sprouts, alway a favorite, and the fried chicken was the best EVER!  I don't order fried chicke, but it was tender, lightly breaded and succulunt beyond my imagination.  The best thing was that the wine and beer were on special so that we could enjoy a reasonably price night out, without breaking the bank or getting frustrated over feeling like we didn't get the value for the price.  It was ON the mark!!  We will be back...",

It was like showing up to Mom's house for dinner. So comfortable and cozy inside. Loved EVERYTHING about the ambiance! We ordered about four of the six starters...Duck Tostada, Cheese Curds, Fontina Sticks, and the Parsnip & Potato Poutine. All the starters, except the duck tostada, revolved around cheese  which was a little rich. Still yummy, but quite rich. I ordered the Salmon which was cooked perfectly and the risotto was great! The others in our party enjoyed their meals as well....they ordered the Pine AZ Spiced Steak (which looked SOOO good medium-rare), the Lobstah Mac n Cheese, and the Meat and Three which I think was a BBQ Pork Shoulder with jalapeno corn bread, collard greens, and some sort of chicken soup. Not a single one of us was disappointed with our meals. I'm so glad I finally ventured over to try this spot! Would love to come back once I'm eating meat again (trying Pescetarianism for a year) and try more of the menu. Also, big shout out to David! He was our server and did a fabulous job with us. He was knowledgeable, attentive, and had an adorable personality. Thanks David at Tuck Shop! :)  -I'm a little bummed that I wasn't given a cocktail menu. After reading other reviews, the signature cocktails sound amazing! =-( Next time I guess.",

Service: Excellent You are welcomed by a non pretentious friendly staff who will seat you promptly if you have a booking, otherwise you have the option to be seated at the bar or take drinks in the adjoining Mid Century Modern Lounge where drinks are served. The knowledgable servers have great drink recommendations and pairings with food.  Atmosphere: Vibrant The Tuck Shop has a warm cosy unassuming relaxed feel. The lounge is a well thought out space with ample seating to enjoy drinks while waiting to be seated.  Drinks: Great Selection When seated at our table we were presented with an impressive drinks menu which included an assortment of cocktail's, a nice selection of wines and finally for the beer drinkers a selection of Larger's, Ales, IPA's and Porter. I was impressed with the IPA on tap which had the hoppy flavor without the bitter after taste.   Food: Excellent. Having been there three times in the last month I am slowly making my way through tasting everything on the menu.  Starters, so far I have tried the following: Cheese Curds, Grilled Baguette, Savory Pancake, Zucchini Planks and Sonoran Pigs in a Blanket. The flavor and texture of the starters was excellent but my favorite was the Pigs in a Blanket closely followed by the Grilled Baguette. The Pigs in a Blanket contained a local favorite Schreiners sausage wrapped in flaky crisp pastry with bacon, pinto beans and pico, the flavor was exceptional.  Smaller Plates, I had the \"Lobstah Mac and Cheese\", I have never been impressed with a Mac and Cheese dish until now. The \"Lobstah Mac and Cheese\" dish was exceptional. The cheese which had the flavor of a Dublin cheddar was complimented by the infused herbs and crowned with a piece of Lobster cooked to perfection. This combination produced a sophisticated flavor with a variety of textures which delighted the palette with every bite.  Main Dish, I have tried the Chicken and Waffles and Steak & Frites. The Chicken and Waffles was great but the Steak & Frites were exceptional. I had the Filet Mignon cooked Medium-Rare and it did not disappoint. The flavor of the steak combined with the red wine sauce and texture of the meat was mouthwatering, needless to say all the steak was cleared. The frites were crisp as expected and complimented the juices of the steak and wine sauce.  Finally I had a Cappuccino or two which were great.   This restaurant sets a new standard in service, ambience, selection of drinks, exceptional food and value for money.  Will be back soon.",

    "text": "Get out of the 'burbs, people - downtown Phoenix is where it's at!   I've visited the Phoenix area four times in the past year, and on every trip, I ask somebody to take me downtown. The usual responses are: \"Um, I've never been there,\" \"Why?\" \"Nobody goes there,\" \"There's nothing downtown.\"  On all my previous trips, I begrudgingly listened to them and kept eating at the plethora of urban Italian wine bar places that seem to run rampant in this area. You know what I'm talking about - dark, \"trendy,\" lots of bruschetta, pizzas, and wine.   Well, on this trip, I decided to take the reigns and just go downtown. I grabbed some colleagues and just drove into the center of downtown Phoenix. I pulled over at a gas station and whipped out my iPhone to use my beloved Yelp app to find a dinner spot. And that's when I was pointed to Tuck Shop.  As I drove down the dark, residential street, my navigation system led me to what looked like somebody's house. After nervously parking (Is this really it?!), my friends and I walked inside to one of the most pleasant surprises! The inside of Tuck Shop is beautiful, homey, and very mid-century modern.  We were warmly greeted by the staff and sat in their comfortable waiting space and had classic cocktails. Do yourself a favor and get the house-made ginger ale and whiskey. Yum!  For dinner, here's what we had: * cheese curds - delicious little fried bites of heaven * chorizo-stuff dates - sweet and spicy * mac and cheese with \"lobstah\" - two of my friends got this and raved over it * beet cannelloni - earthy and delicious * chicken and waffles - perfectly cooked chicken with light and crispy waffles  We all left that night extremely happy that we ventured downtown and discovered such a fantastic place!",

I don't know about this random little restaurant that literally is tucked away...But then I tasted the first bite of the appetizer and immediately realized the mistake I had made by pre-judging this adorable little restaurant.   Like I said... little. It's pretty small inside, but ALWAYS busy. How can it not be busy with food that tastes so great and amazing wine specials to match. It's like Tuck Shop was invented for the sole purpose of making your mouth happy.   I need to stop. I'm getting hungry thinking about it. The stuffed dates are perfect. If you decide to try Tuck Shop, do yourself a favor and try them. The Beef Cannelloni is fabulous as well. Mac and Cheese. OMG.   And, although I am NOT a chicken and waffle kind of gal, it is so good here. I couldn't help but want to order it again.   Needless to say, Tuck Shop is easily a favorite and one that I will be returning to in the near future.",

We had told them all how amazing this place was and were jazzed to eat there as it had been a couple years since we had been in.  We got there right at 5 when they opened, as we were around the corner at the PHX Art Museum. We walked in and were promptly greeted. We asked for 6 adults plus a high chair...when we got a dead pan \"we don't have high chairs\" response.   Tuck Shop you are sending a very loud and clear message that you do not care to serve families. (insert slow clap here)",

However, to my surprise, it was indeed a \"tucked away\" restaurant.  My first impression of this place was it was a cute little home with a family room as a waiting room, which I thought was pretty cool. Not a lot of sitting space so I hope you come on a slow day.  We ordered 3 items, the Brussels Sprouts, Date salad, and the Lamb Meatballs.  The Brussels Sprouts was crispy and tasted of charred vegetables.  Guess it was supposed to be that way but wasn't right for my palate.  The dates salad was definitely my favorite!  It had a hint of sourness from the dressing and sweetness from the dates -- nice and light.  The lamb meatballs were good I thought, but nothing to rave about.  Wasn't gaming like most lambs, but I thought the marinara sauce over powered everything.    Service was good nothing to say here.  The host was kind and attentive. - Enjoy!",

It's never in my line of sight, so to speak, and I occasionally only remember it when it's not convenient to go. That is also part of the charm though.  So anyway, there I was making a daring move to go to a place I'd never been for my birthday (daring to my friends anyway), and it was one of the best experiences I've ever had. We sat at half of the community table, and even the pickiest of eaters found items they enjoyed on the menu. As for me, my eyes saw nothing but the home-brewed ginger ale (I make my own ginger simple syrup) and the chicken and waffles. The food was so amazing, no one spoke during most of it. And while they didn't have dessert really for the birthday girl, they brought me out a scoop of cookie dough, in a cute glass dish, with a candle on it. It was awesome they cared enough to make the best of the dessert menu they had.  The vibe is very relaxing, even on a Saturday evening. The service was just the right speed and not at all too pushy and no one minded our birthday gifts and small chatter. To this day, friends are asking when we are going to go back. My answer is always, \"Maybe my next birthday.\" This truly may become birthday ritual.",

However, we had a GREAT experience!    The restaurant was an old home with a lot of modern flair.  The tables were spaced out well (so you weren't packed in like sardines in a can).  With reservations, they pull out the scrabble tiles and spell out your name (what a neat touch)!  Everything from the food, to the service, to the bartender (who can actually mix drinks), and even to the manager who was very nice and helpful.  Highly recommend the Cheese Curds, Poutine, and the Red Beans and Rice!  I am fairly certain that we will be going back again...and soon!",

When I asked if they mistakenly gave us tea, the waitress had an apologetic face suggesting we were not the first to question it.  The macaroni n cheese was okay, but for $13 it was a small plate and on the dry side. The $6 add on for lobster was NOT a generous amount and disappointing.   The chicken and green beans that came with the waffles were superb.   I would of been okay with the $50 bill for two had the food tasted better.

I kid you not.  $12 for mac-n-cheese, $35 for steak, and $20 for chicken and waffles.  The steak sounded awesome, though!

    "text": "You are going to want to start with drinks (always).  The 13 and 14 are a whiskey lovers instant favorite.  The 13 is going to come off like a figgy Old Fashioned, and the 14 is a bit more unique, sweeter with rye as the primary spirit, but well-balanced nonetheless.  You cannot go wrong with either.  There is also a dangerous blue berry, vodka or gin heavy beverage that comes out cloudy white that you can drink all night.  For red wine go with a malbec, they have outstanding choices.  They also have some rare aged whiskies that are going to change based on availability, but ask if you are hurting for brown liquor on its own.  For white wine, you are on your own.  I don't go there.  On to food.  Do not deny yourself the fried cheese curds.  They come out crispy, melty, salty and sauceless, and so right.  They are really the essence of cheesiness.  They have a delicate flavor though, so you do not really need some overwhelming aioli mucking things up.  Next, try the baguette with roasted garlic and olive oil.  Simple logic here: fantastic ingredients perfectly executed.  They bring you a whole roasted garlic, sitting in a little pool of olive oil, and it spreads like butter on soft slightly toasted baguette.  Carbs, good oil, and bliss.  Your breath is going to be garlicky.  If you are on a date and your date is not into that, get a new date.  You are going to be distracted by the many main dish  offerings.  Get the gnocchi.  Growing up with an Italian grandmother, you learn to appreciate a good gnocchi when you taste one.  Camille would approve of Tuck Shop's super tender gnocchi clouds, airy on the inside, with slight crisp on the outside from the pan frying treatment.  They come in a cheesy sauce, which is strong on the parmigiano, and thick and creamy.  I cannot remember the last time I had gnocchi this good.  Highly recommended.  My mom loves gnocchi, so I know where I'm taking her for mother's day.  Finally, get the Lobstah Mac and Cheese.  Warning long winded preface incoming.  I am not a mac and cheese guy.  So often it is just sludgy cheese sauce and overcooked slimy noodles.  Adding lobster on your average mac and cheese (or mashed potatos while we are on the subject) is like putting a big block V-8 into a wrecked Ford Pinto; you are taking something great, and putting it into an unmitigated mess.  Lobster mac and cheese in general is more idea than food.  It always sounds better than it is.  It occupies the imagination as dare-not decadent; the kind of showy food that a gold miner would order for his hookers after hitting the mother lode; the kind of thing Camille, who survived the Great Depression, would be ashamed of me for ordering, wasting good money ; the combination of the comdortable and familiar and unexperienced luxary: the embodiment of the American Dream, and just as elusive: classic Americana that's grown-up, sexed-up, and classed-up with little something extra, a little something rare, a little something different.  I went to those lengths to talk about everything Tuck Shop's Lobstah Mac and Cheese is not.  It is fucking great.  I added with lobster (obviously) and got the bacon on the side (for maximum crispness).  The pasta was al dente, the cheese sauce was rich and creamy, without being overly decadent, the baked topping is a pleasant textural contrast with a subtle crunch.  The lobster was cooked right, and did not get lost in what is usually an overwhelming setting.  The name of the game here is balance.  It is everything the Tuck Shop represents.  In closing, Tuck Shop is a place every 20 or 30 something who grew up in Arizona needs to experience.  Aside from the killer food, drinks, and service, Tuck Shop more importantly reflects the latest example of the cultural renaissance Phoenix is experiencing.  The children of Arizona, like Grace Unger, are staying or returning home with the dream of transforming our sleepy desert town into a racuous food, drink, and entertainment capital with its own saguaro laced flavor.  It is a thriving business that sprouted out of the once ailing Coronado neighborhood, which is helmed by a young female entrepreneur who takes your dining experience personally.  Grace wants you to be happy.  She wants to get to know everyone who walks in her door.  She, like Tuck Shop, is instantly familiar, fun, and Classed-Up Classic.  I hope you love it here as much as I do.  See you at the bar!",

    "text": "Thoroughly outstanding food, service and originality.  Located in a quiet neighborhood near downtown this place has it all.  Retro vibe with couches like we had in our home in the 60's, small intimate bar seating, a nice view of the kitchen and a small number of tables.  Went with my daughter and her husband and we had appetizers and small plates.  For apps we had the cheese curds and Sonoran style \"pigs in a blanket\" made with a local craft sausage....curds were smooth, creamy and had a mysterious spice that moved them over the top and the dogs were unique, spicy and filled with flavor.  For small plates we had the spicy shrimp that was perfectly prepared and as good as what you get in New Orleans, next we had the Lobster Mac and Cheese, utterly sumptuous.  The huge hit was the Pork Belly with a little frisee salad that was perfectly prepared, sweet, savory and just plain delicious.  It may be out of the way but it's worth the trip.",

    "text": "I'm not from the Phoenix area so when I searched for best restaurants for dinner, Tuck Shop was one of many that came up. The reviews and menu seemed solid so I booked a reservation with the restaurant directly through Yelp.  I mentioned in the reservation comments that it was my girlfriends birthday and when we arrived they did not disappoint.   Upon arrival the hostess wished her happy birthday which put a big smile on her face.  They gave us a nice seat in the back corner which felt private and the waitress greeted us with 2 glasses of complimentary prosecco garnished with a slice of strawberry.  The food was delicious and the overall experience and service helped make her birthday dinner memorable.   The meal and drinks: We shared a bunch of small plates: - Shrimp Piri Piri - amazing, nice sized shrimp with the right amount of spice. It was difficult not licking the plate - Pork Belly - delicious- nuff said - Tuna tartare - nice firm tuna with a perfect arugula garnish - also a plate licking struggle - Stuffed dates - with chorizo and gruyere that literally melted in our mouths - we had the No. 51 and No. 57 for cocktails which were both mezcal based and paired nicely with all the dishes  To round off the experience they produced a delicious apple fritter thingy with a candle for dessert that was light and not too sweet.",

Every single time I am here 2 things stand out -  a) The service, really is what Barney would call .. legend... wait for it.. -ary ! b) The food is delicious !   Given that it is located in the Coronado historic district there isn't a patio (zoning regs), and the restaurant itself is hidden unless you knew it was there. There is ample parking available in the empty lot across the street which is always a plus.  It does get busy so I would recommend making reservations ahead of time. They are very accommodating if you are trying to organize something or the other and will try to make it work.   They do go out of their way to make you feel welcome and heck even if you weren't a regular they still make you feel like one. The staff is polite and courteous to a fault, and never have i ever felt rushed at the place. They even ask you in what order you would like your food, so its not like there is a lot on your plate all of a sudden.   There is a plethora of vegetarian options and they will try to make adjustments if they are feasible. I always thought that was very nice of them to do so. The food is consistently good and while the management may have changed over time the food tastes consistently good.   All things said, it is on the pricier side, and so there is that but honestly the food, the atmosphere and the service makes it worth it.",

The staff make you feel right at home. Everything I ordered was delectable.   We started out with the cheese curds. They were deliciously fried goodness. The batter reminds me of the batter they use for calamari. My boyfriend thought they were too greasy and salty but I honestly enjoyed them. My sister ordered the shop salad which we enjoyed. The dressing was so good and the steak that accompanied it was cooked perfectly. We also ordered the pan fried gnocchi and this was one of my favorite dishes of the night. I never thought I would enjoy fried gnocchi but I did. It tasted perfect with the parmesan cheese sauce (it might have been polenta?). For my main dish, I had one of their specials, crab cakes with frittes. The crab cakes came with delicious aioli and the frittes were crispy and paired well with the cakes. My friends ordered the chicken and waffles and they didn't think the chicken in particular was anything special. My friend said she didn't like the way it was seasoned but the green beans were perfect. They also enjoyed the mac and cheese. This restaurant is a little pricey, too pricey for downtown Phoenix in my opinion ($39 for crab cakes) but over all, I believe it was well worth it.   At the end of our meal, our wonderful server Dustin gave us all tequila shots on the house. I loved this restaurant from the moment we stepped in and I can't wait to be back.",

I am STILL dreaming about this dish, and it was gorgeous too.   For the entree, we split the pork with a bacon & bourbon jam glaze, onion rings, and charred radicchio.

Next we had the dates, to die for!! Then, Mac and cheese because we always get if it is on the menu. It did not disappoint! Last was the pork belly I can't even describe how delectable it is! It even comes with a salad -apple frisee salad with maple apple dressing heaven!The owner is so kind and engaging. She stopped by outlet table sever times to make sure we were taken care of and also introduced us to a digestif called amora that is out of this world. I had never had one quite this smooth and delicious.  We also had the raspberry bread pudding for desert. It was actually the last thing I would have picked. It the owner said it was her mother's recipe so we decided to try it and boy were we glad! It's made with croissants and has this divine sauce it is sitting in.  I can't say enough good about this place. Make a reservation and git on over!!",

The interior is very cute and the fresh floral arrangement in the front window adds a nice touch. We arrived at 945 (brunch starts at 9) to find ourselves the second couple inside. It stayed that way till past 1030. I ordered the eggs Florentine which was excellent. The Benedict sauce was delicious and the egg cooked just right. The potato hash was so burned and over-oiled it was inedible. The coffee was very watered down and weak. Our service was excellent with all of the staff attentive and very nice. For the positive reviews and reputation this establishment has, we expected more. Unsure if it was an off day. We will probably return and give it another try as the Benedict was excellent.",

Very classy place--perfect for a date night or fun girls dinner!",

The fried cheese curds (I've been craving since I visited Wisconsin), the lobster Mac and cheese, and the chicken and waffles. However, I was let down on all of them. Maybe my expectations were too high.... :/ The cheese curds didn't have as much flavor as I had hoped and were quite greasy. The lobster Mac and cheese wasn't very cheesy at all. And the chicken and waffles had no sweetness to counter the salty. The fried chicken was good and the service was good. But sadly, I was disappointed by the meal.",

Warm, welcome, quirky, and just the kind of place I really enjoy. I notice a few large windows near a sofa. Sparce soft lighting. Different wooden tables. A strip of wood panels on the ceiling. Plenty of bar seating.  Art on the walls. What more can a girl like me ask for?  Food, that's what. Oh and a beverage!  David approached our table to tell us about the drink specials and then gave us a few minutes to decide. We decided on a couple dark and stormies.... Best I've ever had. Really.  We placed our order for food and just to have it come out as it was ready.   First came the cheese curds. My favorite bar food. Lightly beer battered, seasoned to perfection and delicious!  Next came the mac and cheese. Saucy, creamy, rich and well seasoned. Covered in proscutto, bread crumbs, and lobstah! I have a weakness for really good mac and cheese. This one is way, way up there. Then our chicken and waffles came out! Three crispy pieces of fried chicken perfectly scortched and well seasoned greenbeans and a huge sweet, flaky waffle smothered in butter. Finally it was desert time. David told us that the deserts change every few weeks and named what was available. We chose the Brazilian banana bread pudding. This desert was perfect.   My friend and I shared these plates. Don't try to conquer all of them on your own. You will really end up in a real food coma. So. Much. Good. Food.   I might still be in said food coma...

    "text": "FINALLY went for dinner and it didn't disappoint. The food is top notch, and although we sat at the bar we were quite comfortable. We ordered a start, a smaller plate and a sharing plate and split each one. Every bite was a True pleasure. These, along with the INCREDIBLE whiskey sours (all mixers are made in house - huge plus if you like cocktails as we do) left us well satisfied. Will return in a heartbeat.   Atmosphere is a relaxed hip-no pretension here-and while it is a small place it's not overly crowded or noisy. Great energy compliments the food and drink which is top shelf. If you are looking for a local place that you will want to come back to and bring  your family and friends-this is a good spot to check out.   We would have given them 5 stars, but we called from the parking lot to ask if there was a wait for two and were told no wait. When we walked in, the wait was 45+ minutes. We were lucky because we were immediately seated at the bar, but this is a turn-off as far as we were concerned.   End note: The bartender (forgive us - Lori, Laurie, or Lauren) was an excellent bartender, was able to help us decide what to order, and her choices were dead-on!",

In fact the waiting area was setup like someone's living area with couches, books, art, etc.  We started off with a few cocktails and they make them good and strong!  The okra and shrimp came with some interesting dipping sauces and had quite a kick.  I am not a big southern comfort food fan but Tuck Shop does bring a nice, light touch their dishes.  The mac n' cheese was good but I expected it to be divine, especially with lobster added to it.  The baby lettuce salad was refreshing on a hot, summer night in the desert.  But the pork t-bone was my favorite of what we tried as it was juicy, well-seasoned and perfectly cooked.  The servers were friendly and courteous and made the dining experience a great one.  Looking forward to going back1",

I have lived in Phoenix for twenty years and I have never heard of this place. The menu is unique which I love. Our server was knowledgeable and kind. Off of the menu we started with the a light Cheese Curds snack and street taco's. The food came out quickly after ordering it. Then we tried the Mac and Cheese off of the small plate menu. The two of us were beginning to get full so split an entree of meatloaf which was a special this evening. I thought the meatloaf was a little bland but the sauce was great with a kick to it. I probably would not order the meatloaf again if I went back. The white cheddar waffle was okay but somehow too eggy for my tastes. My friend ordered chorizo stuffed dates and he was very happy with his choice. We ordered two desserts that were special and not on the menu. Both were excellent, one chocolate flourless torte and one strawberry. This restaurant is small with only about a dozen tables and we did not have a wait when we arrived at 6:30 pm on a Saturday. If you arrive much later, expect a wait. They have a small bar but that was full by 7 PM. There is an area with a couch to wait comfortably. We were there for two hours, enjoying our food and wine.  This restaurant is located in a house in a residential area which adds to the uniqueness of it.  For you carb lovers like me, they did not serve bread. I can list every restaurant based on good bread so that was my only disappointment here.",

To make a reservation at your restaurant for 4 people, you're asking me to pay you $102 and some change just to come through the door?  I see that you will apply this to my bill, however what if we don't spend $20/person, or if my service is horrible and I don't find a 20% tip appropriate?  In all my travels (NY, LA, London, Italy.....) I have NEVER had a restaurant ask to be paid ahead of time, just to hold the seats.

It's also not open Sunday and Monday.   A date and I split their savory cake and their potato skins to start. I believe she got the special, which by the way are always excellent, and I got the steak. The steak was a very good size and cooked to order, was a very enjoyable meal. Their dessert menu also changes frequently to stay fresh so you'll really have to go yourself to see what they have.   All the dishes are plated beautifully and the small interior lends itself to evoke a very intimate feel. I would highly recommend for any sort of special engagement or romantic date. Of course, there's also no stopping you from going with a smaller group of friends for some very very good American food.",

The chicken and waffles were the best I've ever had, my eggs Benedict was fantastic. Arguably even better than the food are the cocktails, every drink we got was absolutely amazing and reasonably priced for using good quality liquor. The service was also fantastic and the restaurant itself is adorable. My only regret is not going here sooner",

Our server was so helpful, guiding us to some new favorites. We shared the beer-battered cheese curds, and garlic/baguette - both were magic. Then we wandered through the mac-and-cheese, beet side salad, roasted brussell sprouts with polenta (YUM!) to the ahi tuna (my favorite of the evening) and the steak with frites. That heavenly sauce on the steak.... wow. Our favorite dessert was the raspberry bread pudding - a True gem, but hey... the creme brulee was pretty darn good too. Thanks for a great evening - lovely wine & beer menu too.",

We had a little of everything, and it was the clean plate club. No one left anything for later, except for the chicken and waffles which was a LOT! It was all good. The seafood special (Chilean Sea Bass), steak special (Filet) was cooked to perfection, lamb was amazing with wonderful polenta, ribs falling off the bone with excellent slaw, Spring salad was all raved about.  deserts were shared and a great way to top of a wonderful meal!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to try this place for so long and finally made a reservation for my birthday. On arrival the ladies at the front were very nice and welcoming. Once we were seated it took about 10 min or so to be acknowledged by the server. When he arrived, no hello, no welcome, no nothing he literally stood there. So my wife asked to order a drink and he just walked away, didn't even ask what I wanted. Another 10 minutes later or so he took our order but again we had to tell him we wanted to order he said nothing. But the weirdest thing is he went right over to the next table that arrived and was friendly, welcoming and explained the menu, very attentive. A few minutes later our entrees arrived. Again no word out of him, and we were still waiting for my wife's drink we ordered 30 min ago. Everyone around us that arrived well after us got their drinks. So my wife asked the server, when her drink would arrive, he said we are busy and just walked off. I'm not sure what we did other than just ordering our food and patiently waiting but the blatant disrespect to us was unwarranted. The food was excellent no complaints there, and the drink finally arrived when we were almost done. After we finished our entrees he put the bill on the table. Never asked if we wanted more drinks, no mention of any dessert menu or anything. But again he went to the table next to us and asked if they would like to see a desert menu. I don't know what else to say but this was possibly the worst waiter I have ever encountered at s restaurant.",

She has very strict dietary restrictions to be both gluten and diary free. I called ahead to speak to Grace (Grace and Lee are the owners) and make sure they could accommodate what we needed. Grace was lovely from the get go saying they had done gluten free but not both but that they could make it work.  Make it work they did! I have never seen Shirley eat everything that was put in front of her! They made gluten free and dairy free scones, bread for her tea sandwiches, and a mini Victorian Sponge. They made diary free whipped cream,cream cheese for her sandwiches, and custard.THEN, they made an out of this world gluten free/dairy free strawberry cheesecake AND a dark chocolate ganache cake.  Grace and Lee having an amazing little place! I absolutely LOVE it!",

    "text": "Oh the Tuck Shop. I love you, let me count the ways....   This tucked away gem was recommended to me by my Realtor and the owners of the house we just purchased. Both live in Coronado Historic District and are self proclaimed foodies. Being a foodie myself I thought to try this little place, that is easily missed if you don't look hard enough.   I was greeted at the door by a very sweet gentleman. I have to say that my food experience starts with hospitality. If I am ignored or spoken to in a condescending manner my perception of the experience is affected. Everyone in the restaurant treated us with respect and offered a smile. I really like the atmosphere they create with their generous hospitality.   The food at the Tuck shop is stellar. We decided to have a sampling of appetizers so that we could try many of the options. Their menu seasonal, so you may not be able to have the same options if you are visiting any time other than summer.   We shared the stuffed dates, pasta fries, and lobster mac and cheese. All of the selections were really wonderful. This is comfort food! The dates were stuffed with cheese and chorizo, the flavors balanced well and it was complimented with a tangy green salad. The pasta fries were so good that they were gone in 10 seconds flat. We literally inhaled them. The lobster mac and cheese was great and the flavors and textures really worked together.   If you are in Historic Coronado you should really try this restaurant. I am totally impressed with their brilliant food and service.   5 stars!",

    "text": "The Tuck Shop was our restaurant for the last 6 years...warm and welcoming.  They changed ownership recently and I was hoping it would continue to be our go-to place.  We went there tonight with an open mind and open heart, but unfortunately we were sadly disappointed.  Upon entering, we were asked if we had a reservation (we did not) and the host said he would see if he could seat us.  The restaurant was almost empty and that is in plain view of all.  I wanted to leave then but thought they may have reservations coming in at any minute to fill it up.  Nope.  Only one couple came in the entire time we were there.  All the former staff is gone  except our favorite waitress Jenny.  Thank goodness for one bright star in an otherwise dismal evening.  The ambiance is what the Tuck had going for it, and that is gone.  I'm writing this review to let the new owners know that if you're going to make it in this neighborhood you need more warm and welcoming (think Cheers) and less haughty and austere.  I'll give you another chance when I hear you've gotten your act together, but until then I will take my business elsewhere.",

They had an amazing special that was $39 for a four-course-meal for two.  Everything we had was so delicious! Neither of us could stop eating the jalapeno cheese curds nor the macaroni and cheese; both were very cheesy, heavy, and just the right portion.  The filet mignon was tender and the cut was a little thinner than it's supposed to be, but still very good for the price.  For dessert, we had their cheesecake, also delicious.  They seem to change up their menu frequently so the dessert items are often different.  The cocktails there were also fantastic.  I'm a huge lover of a well-mixed drink with balanced flavors, and this place had it all.  The negroni was right on par with what it should taste like, and their whiskey sours were nothing like either of us had ever had.  I would definitely recommend the whiskey sour to anyone that goes there, because it is a must-try!  All in all, nice, quaint atmosphere with a very interesting arrangement of furniture that resembles a living room in one part, great food, and excellent service.",

My wife loved the decor, and it felt very comfortable.  I found it funny that a few people were confused by the sliding restroom doors and thought it was appropriate to use the bathroom in full view of anyone happening down the hallway!    I still remember the taste from a few standout dishes that night....mmmmm.....filet mignon and shrimp dish.  I'm not sure if we had a special menu for our group, or if the menu changes frequently, but I didn't see some of the items we ate when I browsed the menu on their website.

Tucked into a neighborhood you have a very cozy, eclectic little joint.  From the start to the end we received extremely friendly service. We of course tried the foods suggested in previous reviews and by the server.  The pasta fries were unique, light and paired with great tasting sauces.  A definite dish you have to try.  We also tried the figs stuffed with chorizo.  Also very good & savory.  But the ABSOLUTE FAVORITE of the night were the chicken and waffles!  My gosh is this the dish to come to the Tuck Shop for.  The chicken was deliciously seasoned and had the perfect fry on the outside and moist chicken on the inside.  The waffles were served with a butter that seemed to be whipped with possibly honey and the syrup was just the right sweet.  All the flavors seemed to work with just the right amount of sweet and savory.  The grilled fresh green beans were the perfect side.  I think I would get this dish over and over and over again.  Then I would go back and get it again.   Great place we will frequent often.    P.S. They make their own tonic.  Yep, their own tonic.  GREAT tasting!  Try it with the vodka they serve (haven't heard of it before but was very pleased).",

    "text": "Ventured to the Tuck shop with a girlfriend Friday night after hearing from someone random about this place.  First off, loved the small restaurant, cozy trendy vibe right off the bat.  Since it was a Friday night, we did have to wait a few minutes for our table, but luckily the host came over and offered to get a glass of wine for us.  He offered some suggestions... I liked mine, my friend did not.    As far as the food is concerned, I enjoyed almost ALL of it.  We decided to try several of the small plates/appetizers.  So, we had the crepes, cheese curds, the salad with avacado, and the dates.  The crepes were awesome as were the dates.  The cheese curds were a bit salty, but still very good.  I liked the salad, but it didn't blow me away by any means.  At the end of the meal we shared the apricot cake, which I found to be very dry, but my friend REALLY liked.  I will be back for sure.  I want to try that chicken everyone is raving about as well as the mac and cheese.  This is a fun, unique spot for some noshing and drinks!",

    "text": "Wow...we really had a GREAT night at Tuck Shop. I am so close to giving 5 stars but i'm going to save that for my next visit. We (our little dinner group) went armed with an appetite and having read other YELP reviews for inspiration. We weren't terribly surprised that there was a little wait even on a Wednesday night. But we went into the Reading Room and waited until our table was ready. Just about everything about this restaurant feels good. The location in historic Coronado....very neighborhoody and the converted house coupled with the great decor...everything tells you that you are going to get a great meal. Unpretentious and just plain delicious.   If there is any personal issue it is that our waiter let us order a stupid bottle of Pellegrino and didn't talk us into the \"plain\" water when indeed the \"plain\" water was the yummiest cucumber water I've ever had. Now personally I am partial to cucumber water...feels very spa-y to me. Can't get enough of it...so it would be my preference.   Our waiter David was darling....very sweet and humored us all night...we like to all try a little of everything so we tend to share everything three ways. A manager-ish person who didn't introduce himself asked how we were doing which is always nice...makes it seem like they care...always works for me in any case but my friend thrust the bill and credit cards at him not realizing it wan't David which he took without a hesitation and did as he was told..I laughed..my friend didn't.   But to the food. We had the Cheese Curds...OMG!! Enough said...how can you go wrong with beer battered deep fried cheese?? And yet after trying these I realize that any other fried cheese products that have been passed off as such for my whole life were frauds! Pure and simple! I'd been duped. This was heaven in a little ball of high calorie-high fat goodness!  On to the chorizo stuffed dates. Simply divine. Wouldn't change a thing. I could eat nothing but an order of that alone! Well...maybe two.   Nosh Plate- Most excellent. A Great combination of flavors, textures...the onion jam which was also described as plum jam (I don't know what it was...except delicious) mixed with the lavosh and havarti...Fantastic!   There was something with roasted veggies and hummus. It was great. Absolutely nothing to change.   Then we shared an entree of fried cod or some kind of fish? Idk...i didn't get it. I don't care for white fish much...i found it bland and a bit dry. My friends raved...and loved it...so based on the rest of the night...i'm sure it was just me. So...never mind...  Dessert...shared the molten lava chocolate cake and a blueberry cobbler. The cake was good...mind you we ate every single morsel. But quite frankly...you could get the same thing in any restaurant in town...i wasn't blown away. The cobbler was a bit too doughy-bready for my taste. The bluberries felt and tasted frozen even though I know they weren't because I overheard the story about buying them at the fresh food market from a grower in California or some such whatever....in any case...didn't love it....but quite frankly every single other detail was so fantastic that i'm certain we will go again and again.",

Many adaptive re-uses to get to today and a wonderfully comfortable \"little plate\" restaurant where you can dine bench-style and meet strangers if you're so inclined.  It served as a postal credit union and traveling carnival workers union safe house among its prior incarnations...  The chef is an artist and the prices absurdly low.  We stopped in for a light dinner at 9PM on a Saturday night - and were the next in line.  Many of the diners had biked there - the long bike rack was jammed,  Several people after us enjoyed the living room waiting room, others the big screen TV at the bar while awaiting a table.  Three of us - ordered 2 small plates and the sharing special.  It was just enough - any more and we would've been too stuffed.  11 bucks each before tip.  Toasted baguette covering melted brie and walnuts, accompanied by shaved veggie crisps, potatoes and parsnips frites accompanied by mushroom soup [they called it gravy but that implies flour and fat], pork and beef ravioli in a heavenly roasted tomato sauce.  Finished with chocolate chip cookie dough balls - desserts were sold out.  I could eat here every day...",

Nestled in the cute Coronado Historic District, the Tuck Shop has once again struck a positive cord with this Yelper. I've been here 3 times and have yet to be disappointed. The service is excellent and the food is to die for! Their chicken and waffles rock, although I will say that LoLo's edges them out on the fried chicken part, the cheddar crusted waffles and the corn and pineapple medley are superb!

    "text": "What a great little find! Tuck Shop has been on my radar for awhile because of Yelp, so when a friend suggested trying it, I jumped at the chance.   First of all, I really liked the atmosphere. There was nothing particularly outstanding about it, but it just had a cool and cozy vibe. The service was awesome - we had a really nice waiter and a couple other people checking on us through out the night.   The menu is designed for sharing - which I love to do, so my friend and I ordered a several dishes. We each had a salad. I had the Chicory Salad (hazelnuts, roasted squash, endive, and desert honey-chestnut buttermilk). It's not that often that I go crazy about a salad, but this one was exceptionally delicious. I loved the roasted squash and the dressing had a very slight spicy undertone (cayenne?) that was so good. I'm getting hungry just thinking about it. My friend had the Baby Lettuce Salad (avocado, fennel, orange-pomegranate vinaigrette) which was very good, but she was jealous of mine.   We shared the finger sandwiches (brie, honey, walnuts); fries and gravy (parsnips & potatoes with melted gruyere and a mushroom gravy dipping sauce); the mac and cheese. All were good, but I'd probably only order the mac and cheese again.  All this with a glass of wine made for a pretty great meal. I'm excited to go back!",

    "text": "First read about this in the recent 2009 Best of Phoenix and wow, what a great choice! The place is cozy and friendly (laidback atmosphere) with food that is a wonderful culinary experience. I enjoyed the roasted garlic in olive oil with the toasted baguette slices from the start menu, though the nosh plate might need some work (more types of cured meats, and maybe some of those tiny dill pickles).   From the starter plates we had the crostini duo and the roasted grapes and brie on the multi-grain bread slices was popular with all - the one with the cucumber slices on them, a distant and less exciting second. The other starter - dates stuffed with homemade Chorizo and grueyer cheese, yum! The come on a bed of greens with some sort of vinegar dressing, which was a nice compliment.  For Sharing Section of the menu - the citrus brined fried chicken and cheddar cheese waffles, loved by all! I recommend ordering it early since we asked for it about 7 pm and it was the last one left. Even the braised greens were good. I was not so impressed with the halibut filet plate  - nicely seasoned but frankly, a bit dry.  Other thoughts - they really like cucumber here - they put it in the water (makes it quite refreshing), garnished my gin and tonic with it (homemade tonic, nice but not really wowed by it), and had it on the previously mentioned crostini duo plate - just seemed like a lot of cucumer. As for the service, it was good throughout the meal. The waiter kept things well paced and was a good source of information when asked, without being overly obtrusive.  If you haven't gone, worth checking out and if you have gone worth going back again. :-)",

First visit was solo at bar enjoying zucchini planks, nice red wine recommended by owner/manager Grace Unger, a prosecco, and a lovely creme brulee that two people should eat.  Enjoyed talking with friendly bartender Max.  Second visit with two friends who were very pleased with every aspect of the experience--we loved the ambience and the ribeye and salmon dinner specials were cooked to the perfect doneness.  My friends plan to return.  Service/attention by owners Lee and Renate Unger and his team was excellent.  Saw him visiting with everyone.  Third visit with a workmate just as great.  Lee was prompt with getting us rose proseccos while we waited briefly in the comfy living room to be seated.  Lee recommended gnocchi, soy glazed pork belly, chicken and waffles and filet mignon from menu.  We chose to split pork belly with fries salad and chicken and waffles.  We were not disappointed!  Loved the combo of pork belly with fries salad.  Huge pieces of chicken and huge waffles.  Grace brought us a rose (?) that she thought would go well with the pork belly--great choice.  Georgia Unger was friendly and attentive to us the entire evening along with waitresses Marni and Deja.  Recommending to all my friends!",

The decor was simple but interesting and didn't distract your company but allowed for an interesting conversation piece. The cocktails were made carefully and tasted delicious. The only problem I had was that the menu wasn't vast and that it was a bit pricey. If you're with a picky eater, check the menu out before sitting down. Personally, I don't like the hours since they are tight but I understand them.",

I also had their chocolate cake which was good, but not particularly memorable.  They also serve cookie dough balls at the end of the meal.

    "text": "I must confess, this review is way way over due. And there is not excuse, though if you would accept that the dog ate my review I might try and tell you that is exactly what happened. In actuality I was looking through my reviews today and noticed this one was never written.  The hubby and I went to tuck shop in November. Yup, that long ago. We stopped in before enjoying the art walk. I'm a really big fan of the location, I love all the historic homes, any excuse to drive through these lovely neighborhoods works for me. And the building they are housed in, beautiful. I really love how they set this up. The dining room is lovely and I look forward to taking advantage of using the huge table in the middle of the dining room for a birthday or other celebration in the future.  Service was good, our waiter was very helpful and knowledgeable of the menu. I really love the bottled tea they served.  Now for the important part, the reason I am writing this review so long after the fact: the chorizo stuffed dates, covered in gouda. OMG. I mean really. OMG. These suckers are like little pieces of heaven. My husband and I could not get enough. Sweet and spicy and smoky. I now serve my attempt at them at every family gathering, I think they are making my mother-in-law start to hate me a little less, so special thanks for that Tuck.  We also had the cheese curds, another first, and they were good. And we split the rib dinner. Those ribs, oh boy, the meat just melted off of the bone in the absolute best way possible. My husband was none too impressed by the cole slaw, but its hard for any cole slaw to stand out in a meal like that.  My only gripe, like some of the other reviewers, is the price to portion ratio. We only had four of those mind blowing dates, which would be fine, if the price was better proportioned to the size. I felt a tad bit taken on the ribs also, again small portion for the price. This is the only reason I haven't been able to talk the hubby into another visit as of yet.",

I had attempted to eat here a few weeks previously, but, unbeknownst to me, it was the Coronado Historic District Neighborhood Festival-- and the regretful host informed us the wait was an hour and a half.  The courteousness of the host, the brief peek I had of the interior that night, and a quick scan of their menu online when we got home secured it as a top choice for my birthday dinner, and by making my reservation for 12 a week in advance, we were in!  Because there were so many of us, we were able to order quite a few dishes and trade around-- a practice that the waiter had greatly encouraged when we ordered by saying the dishes were served 'family-style' and meant for sharing.  For that descriptor, I expected bigger portions, but they turned out to be closer to a sizing I generally prefer-- moderate. The quality was excellent, well-chosen flavor pairings, and everything had that great homemade quality-- nothing came out cookie-cutter style.    I was very interested in the cheese and chorizo stuffed Medjools, but as I'm a vegetarian-- I opted for the Fontina & Pear Panini plate. We even received an interesting tip from our waiter while gorging on the slab of chocolate decadence we ordered for dessert-- bleu cheese to break the palette and offset the sweetness.  Not bad, definitely for the adventurer.  The only thing I would have passed on was the cookie dough ball parting taster.  Their presentation was lovely, four or five little dough balls drizzled in chocolate-- though in the end, I've had better raw cookie dough (I've been spoiled by Wanda's Magical Cookie Dough from Sack's for 6 years now) and it didn't quite live up to the rest of the fare.  But hell-- they were free.",

He was told they have one kind of Gin and it comes with a cucumber, no substitutions. You can't have your cocktail with lemon. Is this the soup Nazi's new place? The waiter brought a plate with a lemon wedge but he almost seemed afraid that he would be caught. The drink tasted like cucumber he didn't want to drink it. We had a few small plates nothing great everything was extremely salty or extremely sweet. I think the chef has a problem with his/her palette",

    "text": "Perfect dinner experience!!! That is the only thing that needs to be said for my night out with family for dinner. The Yelp World though demands more info and I owe it to all to post more.   While working with family at the local home show, my father instructed me to find a local spot that provided a more upscale dining experience. Tuck Shop immediately came to mind and I gave them a call.  A very nice gal informed me that they were booked at the time I requested but would call if anyone cancelled. Lucky for us, someone did and dinner was on.  We arrived at 6:30 pm, were greeted by the same great gal from the phone and dinner service began. Here is a list of the amazing food we enjoyed:  Charcuterie Board: Cheese and meats of course. All was tasty and the accompanied grilled bread was so good. Ordered extra given how tasty it was.  Stuffed Medjool Dates: Schreiner's chorizo with gruyere. Yep, dates and they were awesome.   Sweet Soy Glazed Pork Belly: OH MY GOSH, SO AWESOME. It can be so hit or miss when ordering pork belly, but TS nailed it. It was served with a little frisee salad that really went well. Just perfect.  Beet Crudo Ravioli: Chilled beets, cheese, tomato sauce. Refreshing. Decent but not my favorite.  Grilled Rack of Lamb: Miso glaze with broccolini and polenta. AMAZING LAMB! I am not even a huge lamb fan but it was suck on the bone amazing. So glad my father shared and will be back for this dish for sure.   Pine AZ Spiced Steak: Mashed Yukon Potatoes and mushrooms. Tasty dish but after having the lamb, nothing could compete. Potatoes were so good and would ask for the potatoes to end up on the lamb dish when I go back.  Creme Brule: Sweet and creamy. Good dessert.  Raspberry Bread and Butter Pudding: Not sure if this was the name of this dessert, but it was one of the best I have ever had. The texture, the flavor, the whole dang this was so good. It had I believe a whiskey sauce that just rocked. Loved it.  In closing, an amazing meal in every way. Our waitress for the night was as good as they get, the setting was relaxing, and as you read, the dinner was perfect. If one goes and knocks out the pork belly, the rack of lamb with potatoes instead of the polenta, with the bread pudding for dessert, it could go down in anyone's top three meals of all time. Yep, that good.",

Garlic was okay, I've made better and same goes for the brussels. When you say goat cheese polenta I expect and neeeed goat cheese!! Sadly, it was bland.   The small plates sounded so good, we ordered a bunch to share for our mains. The salad, gnocchi, beet ravioli, tacos and a halibut special. Salad was the best thing we ate. Everything else was lacking flavor and felt uninspired. Disappointed I hyped this place up to my guests.",

    "text": "It had been two years since we last dined at Tuck Shop, so I figured that I needed a refresher course before conjuring up a review based on memory. Although interestingly enough, the restaurant has apparently taken new ownership since we last came here.  The restaurant itself is modernly-designed, although very small, with a wine-drinking/waiting area taking up a good chunk of restaurant space that could probably be used for more tables.   Honestly, if we didn't pay a revisit and I based my experience on memories and old pictures, I would have ranked the restaurant at an average of three stars. And during our most recent outing, I'd still stand by that.  Tuck Shop just isn't our kind of place, I guess. It's a restaurant that does a bit of everything where nothing really seems off limits. I don't know what you'd call it. American-Modern food that people seem to like calling \"eclectic\" or almost \"quirky\" in some ways. I can appreciate it, but prefer restaurants that have a bit more of a solid direction in what it is they're trying to accomplish.  They used to have some excellent house-made ginger ale that has since been removed from the menu. Pity, as I liked it so much on one visit that I actually requested a second one.  On our current and past visits, we've also had their cheese curds. Unlike the traditional cheddar, these seem to have more of a mozzarella-typed flavor to them. Personally, I found them to be a bit on the saltier side. Additionally, their roasted Brussels sprouts that include a honey goat cheese polenta was a bit more interesting in terms of flavor and creativity, but a dish that I'll probably forget we even ordered a couple of weeks from now.  Picking from their entrees and small places was tough. There's a lot of dishes that sound potentially interesting, while others are questionable (e.g. taco salad?). I always insist on ordering the times mac and cheese. Like the curds, it's always something that I want so badly to like, but always end up just feeling kind of blase about it.   For the main entre, we opted for a filet that they had on special, which included a mushroom sauce and the usual mashed potatoes and green beans. Overall, it was just okay. Much like the mac and cheese, it wasn't really any better or worse than any other steak we've had. We've had their chicken and waffles in the past, which we ended up hating. Infusing white cheddar into waffles is being different for the sake of being different. Some people like it - but we absolutely loathed it.  Dessert options include a creme brulee - which I've always labeled as a bit of a \"cop out\" dessert with modern restaurants. Their other options seem to continuously change, but we decided to pass on dessert for once. Although I do recall ordering a pecan pie a few years back that was decent.  For two starters, one small plate, and one entree, our bill came to 80 dollars, which seems a bit pompous considering we didn't order drinks. That's probably also another reason why there was a two year gap between visits.  On the plus side, the server was attentive and very polite. I really appreciate that, unlike many restaurants, they actually asked us the order in which we wanted our food served, enabling us to enjoy everything at our own pace without feeling rushed. I've often ranted about places that bring everything out at once. For this, I do give them credit.  Honestly, I can see why a lot of people like Tuck Shop. It's modern food with a creative flare. And although I wouldn't really call the experience anything spectacular, it's one of those places that I still recommend people try for themselves.",

We wanted to sample as much as possible so had the savory pancakes, zucchini crisps, mac and cheese (with lobstah), some kind of hot dogs, pork belly and street taco salad. It was just enough food for the 4 of us. Mac and cheese was rich. The pork belly had great flavor and the apple frisee salad it came with had awesome dressing. Can't quite figure out the savory pancake that comes with a greek yogurt dipping sauce.  The hot dog appetizer was good...it had some kind of beans on it too. Street taco salad was a bit creative but not a street taco?  Great decor inside with a fun vibe.  They have a spot that looks like a trendy hipster living room which was cool.  Bar area and tv.  Private parking.  Overall, good experience but wasn't impressed with the food.  Had higher hopes for the fun menu.",

The menu was interesting but hardly unique. We decided to order an appetizer, two small dishes and two mains to split at a table of three. Within 5 minutes every dish showed up at our table. My first reaction was \"it is simply impossible all of this was made fresh in that amount of time\" and I was right.  The chicken an waffles were simply awful: no crisp to the skin and frankly I should have known better than to order this.  The pork ribs were ok. The shrimp piri piri was meh. The best thing was the special which was a ribeye steak with asparagus but again the accompanying potato was stale.  Overall the food tasted like it was sitting in a keep warm for the last 6 hours which explains how they could rush all that food out so fast.  The result is that quality took a dive.  Sadly I won't be back to Tuck Shop any time soon.",

We have had traditional English tea at many different places. Some that cost less and were much better.

We started with the crab ceviche which was excellent. Homemade chips and so much flavor. Then we had the charcuterie board which was very good and flavorful too. Next, we shared the carne asada tacos which were also amazing. Finally, we ended with the chicken and waffles. Let me tell you, this was my first time having chicken and waffles and I am now a fan forever. They were delicious! We each had 2 drinks. The bartender made me a Mexican mule which was super tasty. After tip, we spent $170. Worth every dollar! We will go back soon.",

I had the sliced pork tenderloin with orzo (the big kernel variety) and a superfluous side-salad. Wonderfully tasty.  My companion was satisfied with her chicken and waffles.  After our complimentary tasty treats of cookie dough, we were off, with my companion impressed with her discovery, thanks to me of course, of this great treasure of an independent restaurant almost downtown Phoenix.   The ambience and the service -- especially the sound level -- just perfect for our enjoyable dinner.  I recommend Tuck Shop for a special treat. You will enjoy it--guaranteed.",

    "text": "I've been to Tuck Shop a few times now and have always had a wonderful experience, but this past weekend was by far my favorite visit!  Tuck Shop had their own version of Restaurant Week. For $50 a couple, you each got a glass of wine, and one selection from each part of the menu. What a great deal! My boyfriend and I started with the Cheese Curds. I've had these every time I've been to Tuck Shop, and they have been amazing each time. How can you not like beer battered cheese?!  Next, we moved on to the Mac & Cheese because you can never have to much cheese in your meal. This might be one of my favorite mac & cheeses ever! It was creamy and cheesy goodness, without being too heavy. The crispy prosciutto and herbed breadcrumbs also provided the perfect added crunch.  For our entree, we shared the Chicken & Waffles.Perfection! The waffles have white cheddar and are super light and flaky. The chicken is citrus brined and was crunchy, moist, and full of flavor. My boyfriend usually doesn't like chicken where each bite isn't covered in fried batter, but the chicken itself was so good, he was eating the meat even after the breading was gone. Trust me, this is a huge deal! That's how good the chicken was.  As if we weren't already gluttonous enough, for dessert we had a vanilla cheesecake coated with a chocolate ganache. I don't think we could have devoured this any faster without resorting to snorting it. The desserts vary, but if this is ever available on your visit, definitely get it! Even if you don't order dessert, they always bring you a small cookie dough bite with your check so you can still end your meal on a sweet note.  Can't wait for my next visit to Tuck Shop!",

    "text": "Meh...  I've had better.    The decor was pleasant and trendy, and the waitresses seemed very friendly (well except for the guy who sat us, he looked like he really didn't give a crap if we were there or not), but the food was just meh...    I had the lemonade and it was a perplexing mixture of not enough lemon or sweetener.  It tasted so watered down that I wasn't even sure it was lemonade, and the sweetness was just barely there.  I even asked the waitress what it was to confirm that I actually received the lemonade.  (Everyone is raving about it here though, so I must've had a VERY bad batch... ?)  We shared some cheese curds and they were very tasty.  Horribly greasy, but quite tasty.  I got the lobster mac and cheese.  My macaroni noodles were mushy, the cheese was too greasy (puddle at the bottom of the bowl) and salty, the lobster was overcooked and chewy and the whole bowl was boiling hot; a tell tale sign it had either been under a heat lamp or microwaved.  Not exactly the wonderfulness on a fork that I envisioned.  My husband got the meatloaf that was on special that night.  The red sauce that it was swimming in was very spicy in an acidic way (which is not a good thing) and the acidic nature of the red sauce clashed badly with the more muted, cheesy scalloped potatoes that accompanied the meatloaf.  Overall this as a pretty weak (and expensive) experience at a restaurant that I had MUCH higher hopes for.     I'll try it one more time to be fair and then I'll decide for good if I just hit it on a bad night, or if it's just a case of 'average food in a trendy setting, being over hyped by soulless hipsters who (in a bitter twist of irony) have almost NO taste of their own'...    Probably the case.",

    "text": "I was debating on how I would rate this place after a year and how everything was this time around. I can tell you right now that I will have some doubt if I choose to come here again. It probably won't be for the food. We went with the current special they have right now for a four course meal to share for 40.  I feel like there was a different chef from the last time we came in for my boyfriends birthday last year exact same date obviously.  Both of us were severely disappointed. We decided to get the potato skins for starters which wasn't anything to brag about. Second was the lobsta Mac and cheese and both my boyfriend and I thought that it didn't taste anywhere the same as last year and it was spicy( I don't mind spice but My boyfriends stomach is sensitive I also prefer baked mac and cheese) for some reason we just thought it was going to be baked and not soupy like velveeta or Kraft. If your into spicy Mac and cheese broccoli type stuff this is for you. 3rd course we had the vovo special which was the beet and spinach raviolis which were good but great? Wouldn't go that far. Lastly was the chocolate pecan pie which was amazing but I totally wish I had a huge glass of milk to go with that. With my boyfriends peach shandy with a shot of pimms he was struggling since he said it was too rich for him. I told him that's what happens when you drink beer and ad a shot of pimms to it so his own fault. I wish I got a glass of lemonade to kind wash down the flavors after each bite.   Everything was good but is it worth $70 including tip. Not at all.  Onto finding a new nice place I can go to for a nice quaint evening that is \"phenomenal\" every time not just once.  After reading another ladies review on how she was refused to enter with her 1 year old is totally disturbing to me. Since we have a nephew that is almost 1 I look down on places that are that rude. If your child is well behaved you should be allowed to go where you please. It's another thing if they were not. So the fact they have that kind of attitude towards people and children in kicking off a star.",

We ordered the zucchini for a starter which was served with a lemon garlic aioli. This was so well seasoned and lightly breaded my friend and I were excited about our entrees. Since this was just a quick dinner to make conversation we ate simple, affordable and light with the French bread pizza featuring Carolina chicken and her order of the portobello melt.  There was a lot of detail to the dishes but with great atmosphere, food and music it wasn't time for the regular pictures of food and examination of the menu. Not our night to examine wine, cocktails and beer but the staff was informative and attentive. It reminds me of many small high end Southern cuisine places I remember in my original kitchens/home in the South with as much attention to soft and intimate aesthetics as the seasonal and ingredient focused dishes.  I hope you make this a great family and date place. We can't wait to try more at Tuck Shop. Kaitlin was a fantastic server to guide through the menu. Glad to see less flash and more comfort plus playing on individual ingredients to make something great. Thank you, Tuck Shop.",

Equally appropriate for date night or girls night.  Don't tell my husband, but girls night is usually more fun--they like WINE!!  And sharing means sharing, not I get one bite before it's gone.  We had a few small plates, and none disappointed.  I was surprised to find myself loving the arancini, but it's amazing what these folks can do to rice.  And the stuffed dates with chorizo and gruyere?  That's sweet, spicy, creamy, and salty all rolled into one exceptional bite.  Also on the menu, mac 'n cheese for Shannon M (as if I didn't partake in this mini masterpiece) and a juicy steak with mushrooms and creamy mashed potatoes.   Deciding to  watch our calories, we shared only two desserts..pear upside down cake and a brownie.  I would say both were \"edible.\"  And no need to even wash the plates.   So, yep, I'm a fan.

The Jalapeno cheese curds were nice, but the Jalapeno was very subtle -- I'd love to try these impaled with a small spear of fresh jalapeno.  The stuffed dates often raved about didn't quite do it for me.  The cloying sweetness of the date muted the flavor of the chorizo, and the smell of the gruyere combined with the scent of caramelized sugar from the date was off-putting to me.  The texture was a bit odd for me as well.  My final dish was the chili, which was tasty but lacked the zing and spice of a really good chili.  I enjoyed the corn cake with cream and sweet potato haystack on top.  The atmosphere is comfortable and the staff very helpful and friendly.  It's a nice place to meet up with friends, share a couple dishes, and have a few cocktails.",

Words cannot do justice to what your palate really needs to experience for itself. Go! ...Now!  They also make their own Tonic for Gin & Tonics...which are delicious (the best I've ever had). So, try one of those too. I've only been here once, but my intuition is that Tuck Shop is one of those places that no matter what you order, you're bound to be raving about it the next day.

Have ordered five dishes that were each unique (\"Roasted Beets\"), satisfying (\"Fried Chicken and Waffles\"). very tasty (\"Catfish Oscar\") and a twist on the normal (\"Garden Salad\"). Desserts, based on the \"Pear Cake,\" are absolutely out of this world and NOT to be missed! In addition to my savoring the selections, adjacent diners were raving about their selections, different from mine, as well!  Will easily, with one or two more visits, become my \"Favorite in Phoenix,\" if both the quality and taste continue to excel and somehow I believe they will.",

It's one of the very few that I will say little about, other than to say that without question, you should eat there.  That's it. If you want a great meal, wonderful service, and super-cute decor, hit up Tuck Shop. Stop reading <a href=\"http://Yelp.com\">Yelp.com</a> and go NOW!

Our group of three had some difficulty figuring out what to order.  I think the idea here is for you to order as a group and share, which can be fun, if you are in to that.    We didn't like the Mac and Cheese with lobster very much.  It's a different twist on this old standby.  We were surprised at the very little piece of lobster you get for an extra $4.  It's not worth the extra money.  Other than these quibbles it was good food and a nice, but small place.  They only take reservations for groups of six or more.",

NOM) and the wild mushroom salad. freaking fantastic, fresh, and clean. then the lamb meatballs came out. wow... just.. now i'm thinking i have to go back and eat them as i write this review. they were incredible flavorful and not gamey at all. just perfect balls of meat served on top of \"spaghetti\" (spaghetti squash) with a marinara sauce i wanted to steal the recipe for.   just an incredible experience that you should share with friends/family/a hot date (because you'll totally get laid)!",

Split a bowl of their tasty chorizo stuffed dates as an appetizer, which was a mistake. Not the dates, the splitting.  These are \"Get Your Own Dates\" sort of dates, and I suggest trying them all by your lonesome.  Went on a Wednesday so the Vovo Special was Fish & Chips. It was quite tasty, but I think I would have rather tried some of the Mac & Cheese I've heard so much about, or one of their other dishes.  But I'll quite likely be returning, so not a problem at all to remedy.",

Tuck Shop is totally one of those places that you want to remain hidden so you can have it all to yourself, but you feel torn because it is so incredibly amazing, that you know it deserves to be really successful. But moving on; ever since my first visit to the Tuck Shop 2 months ago, I have returned 4 times. Each time a friend is visiting town I take them there because it is such a crowd pleaser.   Like everyone said, you could just point to anything on the menu and be satisfied. I order the mac and cheese with lobstah~ every time but I've also tried the roasted beets, chickory salad, tamales, and chicken and waffles. All so so good. The cheese curds also out of this world!

    "text": "It is important to note that the one star rating has nothing to do with the food or atmosphere as we did not even get a chance to have dinner.  My one-star rating is personal and results from me and my family being super offended by the etiquette -- or lack thereof -- of this little gastroshop.    Nothing says, 'Children Not Welcome Here' like not providing a place for them to sit and have dinner.  No highchairs... really?  First, I have heard SUPER great things about this great little hidden treasure.  I SO wanted the Tuck Shop to be my new fav.  My husband, child and are I are True foodies and as part of the Central/North Central community we truly love and support small, eclectic businesses that make up our cool little community.  When we pulled up to the Tuck Shop we were ready to become regulars!  So it was a huge disappointment when we got to our table and asked our server for a highchair for my daughter and his response was, 'We don't have highchairs.'  I was floored!  My husband and I spend a lot of time out and about and have never run into this situation.  After picking my jaw up off of the ground, I asked if children were not welcome at Tuck Shop.  Very flippantly, the server replied, 'No, we just don't have highchairs.'  Needless to say, I gathered my family and hit the road very offended and really not believing what just happened.  We have some pretty great places in our neighborhood... and they ALL accommodate children.    And for the record, I do not enjoy having dinner with screaming children.  I believe that if a child cannot behave properly in public, then they should not be in public.  This includes my child.  She has been carted to every restaurant in the Central/N. Central neighborhood so behaves better than some adults I have had the displeasure of dining with.  If she does happen to act her age in public, my husband or I quickly take her away so as not to disrupt the dining experience of others.  I realize not all parents follow our policy, but really Tuck Shop?  Seems like this 'No Children' policy was designed by a petulant and ill-mannered child.  Tuck Shop, me thinks you need a time-out.",

We also had a salad, pretty good but small for the price, and an appetizer. This was the mixed rellenos which were a little better but missing...something.  My fiance had one of the rellenos with beef in it and he said it was grisly. All together, the bill came to over $80 for one salad, an appetizer and an entree, plus two drinks.

(considering the fried nature of it.) our fellow dining companions talked us into the crapes for dessert, pretty standard.  the bill comes with chocolate chip cookie dough balls, about the size of marbles. unique!  the waiter seemed nice and tolerated us, given that we probably made him stay extra late. we left around 11pm and the kitchen closed at 10. but we were not the only ones left, and doesn't that always make everyone feel better? i'm sad this place wasn't open when lived in Phoenix, it's really splendid and i absolutely suggest you go.",

We were eager to try it, so we brought a few friends over for a birthday celebration and I can't help but only give this place 3-stars. It's probably more 3.5 stars, but I rounded down because I didn't like my wine one bit. The prices aren't very fair in my opinion. In this growing neighborhood, there are several places with better food at lower prices. The food itself was good, but not amazing, and the atmosphere was very low-key and local, which was one of its high points. Stand-outs on the menu include the truffled mac and cheese with prosciutto and the citrus-brined fried chicken. Sadly, I don't remember much about anything else. What I do remember, is that my red wine was entirely too oxidated; as though it was decanted for several hours from a bottle that had a screw cap. Gross. Other than that, they seemed to have some decent beers on tap and it's an okay place to go if you're in the neighborhood...but I'd rather go to Main Ingredient down the road if possible.",

Walking and driving past it, we've been watching the restaurant being built with lots of anticipation and excitement of what was going to arrive.  So I was really excited to walk by this past Thursday to see it open for business.  I went in just to grab a menu, and instead met the bartender and manager, and enjoyed a great Four Peaks Coronado Ale and got to find out what the place is all about.  The decor of the restaurant is beautiful: There is great art work covering the walls from a Tucson artist that is all for sale, and the mismatched chairs with the quaint reading room off to the side, combined with the wood detail throughout the bar was beautiful.  The bathrooms were even amazingly decorated with the greatest sinks!  Anyways, I went back tonight to finally have a full meal to find a completely packed house.  For only being open a week, I couldn't get over the fact that it seemed like everyone from the neighborhood was there and then some, it was so great to see. But, back to the food- I finally got to try my prosciutto and mac and cheese, and it was amazing!  Followed up with a dirty martini, it was definitely a great meal and experience. My only fear is that it is going to turn into a constant happy hour spot for when I walk past it on the way home from work...",

The retooled house is a marvel--very thoughtful design details--pocket doors, acoustic ceiling, compelling lounge area, etc. On to the food. The plates are meant for sharing, and they all struck the right note. In particular the mac and cheese and the fontina cheesesticks with 2 dipping sauces. Better than we expected. Now, it does have the \"LATFH\" vibe and a lot of them in there too, but, no matter. They know to search out cool places and they didn't spoil our time there. Bonus points for making us feel like we were in SF vs. Phoenix. We do like Phoenix, but it's a rare restaurant that transports us out of the city's strange mix of spas, poverty, Hummers, urban blight, Scottsdale strip bars, and religious/gun-toting/conservative wack jobs. Need an escape? Highly recommended.",

    "text": "Went to The Tuck Shop last night for the first time. They have been around since last winter but until a few days ago I had never heard of it. Too bad for me because I have been missing out!.   My wife and I just decided to order a bit of this and that (which I think is the point of the menu). We ordered mac n cheese, garden salad, fontina sticks and chicken and waffles. the food came out in a timely manner and  sort of created its own tempo where we always had a new dish in front of us but never had two at any one time.   The fried fontina was the first and the most disappointing of the four. There was a nice light breadcrumb coating over the super soft mild cheese. There was a lack of seasoning/salt in this dish. They were served with a yin and yang of sauces, pear and red pepper. The pear sauce was very good but the red pepper sauce really needed something else. The dish was a great concept (who doesn't like fired cheese) but needed some more seasoning or tweaking.  The second dish was the salad, tons of spinach, frisee, pickled shallots, green grapes, salami, goat cheese balls. VERY GOOD SALAD, just would have liked the salametti cut into thinner or smaller pieces.   The third dish was the Mac n Cheese w/o the optional lobster. In my persuit for the perfect Mac n Cheese this ranked very high. A perfect combo of cheeses and breadcrumbs and noodles. Then the kicker was that they fried up some proscuitto and crumbled on top. MMMMM good.  The fried chicken with white cheddar waffles was next.... The chicken looked so dark when it arrived that I thought I was going to have to send it back BUT when I tasted the fried batter it was really nice. Good seasoning and nice crunch. The chicken was moist and very good. I did not get the citrus brine flavor the menu talked about but still very good. The cheddar waffles were supper good and almost gooey. The greens they served with them were shocking but good. Acidic and spicy but not chewy as braised greens often get. The combo of the three sets of flavors worked very well. We opted out of dessert but will go back next time for the upside down pineapple cake or the chocolate mousse with fresh whipped cream.  I would have to say that this is one of my favorite spaces in phoenix. I found out that the owner is an architect and then it made more sense. One great big area with slightly mismatched tables and chairs. Simple table settings with white butcher paper. Mint sprigs instead of flowers, simple candles, etc... There was a great little lounge area with couches and coffee tables where a couple ate and looked very intellectual. The lighting was soft but well placed and lots of windows with the summer evening light shining in. The music was a great mix of mostly stuff I had never heard but still found myself wondering who it was so I could download it on itunes the minute I got home.Kudos  to the creator of that playlist, so refreshing from the common restaurant music these days. I am sure the very clean open kitchen would add some energy to the room had they been slammin but the three cooks looked rather board. The only negative I would say about the dining  room was the TV at the bar. I don't mind a TV at a bar (actually I think it is crucial) but I just wish the TV would have been facing a different direction or mounted on the north wall so that it didn't interfere with the vibe so much.  Overall... could be one of my new go-to spots!!! I recommend this spot.",

It would have helped if I was looking at the right side of the street...  On the other hand, the small plates are not that small.  My friend and I shared the crispy shrimp starter and of course chicken and waffles.  That was enough for dinner for two.  The shrimp dish also included asparagus and cauliflower.  All were lightly fried to go with two dipping sauces.  And then there was the much reviewed chicken and waffles.  The waffles with white cheddar were savory and fit for dinner.  It went great with the crispy fried chicken which had a distinct taste that I can't quite describe...  Together it was a well-executed combination of taste and texture: salty and sweet, soft and crispy.  We went on a Tuesday so they had summer cocktails for $3.  That was a steal considering how strong those drinks were.  There you go: great food, great drinks, great price.  Will definitely go back.",

Very quaint, and cute, just an overall warm, friendly vibe. We had about a 30 minute wait for our own table, and we enjoyed some riesling and red zinfandel while we waited in the \"reading room\". The staff was friendly, but not overly intrusive, and very efficient. We started with medjool dates with chorizo served over a bed of arugula (great, fresh, and hearty flavors), and the parsnip and potato fries with mushroom gravy (this was the only dish on the bland side). Our main courses were split between the two of us, and included the times mac n cheese with lobster (incredibly delicious, topped with fresh, tender lobster meat), and the citrus brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles (the waffles were fantastic, as was the flavor of the chicken, I just was a bit disappointed with the veiny, dark purple splotches throughout my thigh piece, but the breast and drums were perfect). Overall, we enjoyed our experience, thought the menu was well thought out, not too large, and pricing was fair, and will be back again to try the lobster etouffee.",

    "text": "From the orgasmic sounding menu and 'hood locale to unique interior and restaurant name, Tuck Shop seems a smidge more concerned with hip originality and nice \"touches\" than with bedrock delivery of food and value. Originality is certainly welcome in Phoenix - it's just that Tuck Shop's substance doesnt always measure up to it's considerable style.   How could it? The menu is the most seductive mid-priced bill of fare I've ever read, and a big reason I came.  Every combo sounds amazing and unique.  I guess my expectations were flying, but felt the food fell somewhat short of its 'promise'.  Little about the Nosh Plate sampler, the garlic and olive oil baguette, or fried cheese with dipping sauces excited my palate. It was OK, but not a single item made me go, \"Wow...that's really good, or unusual. Here, try this\".   Which is a problem, because the whole concept here is about sharing. My wife liked her seared halibut (a $19 \"large\" plate not big enough to reasonably split), but the seafood in my marinated cocktail was more rubbery than flaky or succulent.  The fried chicken was decent (the thigh was a tad undercooked), but I question the sobriety of those claiming this is the \"best ever\" fried chicken. Our citrus brine was not all that flavorful and the hard coating made digging in a challenge. Far pricier than KFC, more attractively plated obviously, but tastes no better in my judgement.  The whole chicken n waffles deal here is clearly a notch or two below Lolo's.   What did we like? The cuke infused water and the fact they brought out the H2o without asking. Homemade ginger ale. That's neat. The turnip greens had a nice kick, and the sour cream sauce over the key lime pie was divine. Our server was very pleasant. The manager stopped by, smiled and refilled our waters.   Is that worth $100, for three people, no booze? Meh, I dont think so.  It's a unique setting for young people to drink and be seen - as a restaurant, which is what we were after, I dont feel it merits more than three stars.",

    "text": "There aren't very many times I find a place that is truly special. Special, in my book constitutes a menu that is creative, a staff that is passionate, and ambiance that is electric. Tuck Shop is one of those places. Although small, the space is used well and the theme is eclectic and fun. The food is \"neighborhood comfort food\" and it doesn't disappoint.   I went with a friend last week and we sat at the bar. It's a unique concept. They have one bottle of everything. One kind of vodka (a brand I haven't heard of and subsequently cannot recall), one kind of rum, gin, tequila, scotch, ect. The wine list is a bit more extensive but  not overwhelming. And they make their own mixers from SCRATCH, which makes the mixed drinks extra special.   We started with the crispy fontina sticks, which were a deliciously more complex take on cheese sticks (a bar food favorite). Next up, we tried the stuffed dates, served on a bed of greens. The dates were stuffed with chorizo and the marriage of sweet and savory was balanced and enjoyable. It wouldn't be comfort food without macaroni and cheese and I wasn't leaving there without eating a WHOLE large bowl full. I decided to try it with lobster and although there wasn't much lobster in it, I realized that for a meager $3 upcharge, I did get at least a few bites! For dessert, we had a pineapple 'right side up cake' and the crispy edge was literally soul melting. There was not one bad bite.   The staff at Tuck Shop is eager to please as well as friendly and knowledgeable. The space is utilized well and although it was fairly busy when I was there, it is set up in a manner that makes the experience intimate.  I will certainly be back.",

I ordered the macaroni and cheese, which was anything but ordinary with herbed bread crumbs and crispy prosciutto. Even their bread sticks have a twist with a bit of paprika and cinnamon in the accompanying roasted red pepper dip. The portions are perfect to fill you up without making you full - one starter and one shared are the perfect size for two people. The servers are friendly and very knowledgeable of the menu - which comes in handy when trying to decide what to order. The atmosphere is homey and inviting, with the noise level staying manageable. Can't wait to get back here and try their BBQ pulled pork and classic strawberry shortcake!",

    "text": "We decided to give Tuck Shop a try on the fly after a movie.  We had our 9 year old daughter and she informed us that she 'didn't get dressed up to go to Tex AZ'.  OK.  I also didn't feel like spending 100.00 on dinner to accommadate her attire.   We drove aimlessly and headed East and then South.  I had Tuck Shop in the back of my mind from another evening when we ended up somewhere else.   We decided to go and look at the exterior and see if it grabbed us.   Very hip.   The mid-century contemporary (not quite 'modern') building was just our style.  Ok...we were feelin' it.   On exterior, instant gratification.  It was a Saturday night just about 7:00.  When we walked inside there wasn't 1 other child there.  So, I was expecting a possible stink-eye from the host.  Not at all.  He couldn't of been more pleasant. He informed us that it would be a 1 hour wait.  I could see two 2 tops but everything else was full.  My husband and I gave the, 'one hour?' look to each other.  A few seconds later, our host said, 'you know what, I can put another chair at one of those tables, if you don't think that would be too tight'.  Perfect.   Within minutes we were seated.  None of us were super hungry so the encourgement to 'share' was perfect.  After ordering our drinks, one of which was my daughter's homemade citrus soda which was absolutely delicious, we began to look over the menu. We decided on 1 item from each of the catagories of Starts, Small and To Share.....Crostini & Garlic spread, mac & cheese and the ribs Special. We had it all brought out at the same time.  Every single morsel was amazing and we all thought that even had we been starving.....it was more then enough. The ribs were the best we'd ever had, falling off the bone and slightly sweet.  They came with some yummy potatoes (or is it po tah tos) and a mouth watering corn muffin on the side.   The server came to refill my daughter's drink and offered to switch her to the homemade Ginger Ale, which she didn't end up likeing as well and we asked to switch back to the Citrus one.  I forgot to look and see what, if anything they charged us to do that, but I didn't care at that point.  Since the ribs were the Special, we didn't know the cost.  We were betting they were at least  $27.00, didn't care about that either.  Nope, $19.00.  I was shocked. By the time we left, the wait was 2 hours and one other family had come in with a 3 year old.  There is no kids menu, but my child, although not small, was very welcomed.  I'm not sure if they had high chairs but hey, Richardson's doesn't either.   Our bill with a beer and a Pinot Gris was 54.00.  I thought for the quality and the ambiance, a bargain.  We will definately be going back.",

    "text": "I'm writing this review first, then will slap some stars to it.   I was wicked excited to go to Tuck Shop.  I suppose you could consider me a foodie, but I think I'm just a guy who likes neat places to eat.  Tuck is a neat little place :)    When I arrived with my lovely date, we were greated promtly and sat at a nice little 2-top near the back.  The restaurant has a pretty interesting feature, in the middle there's a big-ol community table that one can sit at and eat with strangers. Not my bag, but I'm sure some people like it.  And it seems that Tuck Shop's theme centers around sharing your entree's so why the eff not?  I had  HOMEMADE GINGER ALE. HOMEMADE! How cool is that? I geeked out hard and had two glasses of the stuff.  Kinda spicy-sweet and refreshing, like what a ginger ale commercial leads you to believe IT'S drink will taste like !  My date had their fresh squeezed lemonade.  It was fuerte, a little to much so for her, but I kinda liked it.  Her, not so much.   Appetizer: Cheese sticks.  I know, kinda bar food ish right? WRONG. Fucking amazing Gruere (sp?) cheese, panko bread crumbs and crushed walnuts all fried together in a glorius miniature twinkie shaped goo- jem made just for my mouth (again, a little gay there).  Served with Pur'reid (SP? I need to work on my SP)  pear and onion dip.  Holy monkey. I am officially a cheese stick snob.  Entree's:  We got two of the larger entree's, I got the citrus brined friend chicken with cheddar waffles, and she had the maple pork with carmalized pear chips and gargonzola grits.  Now, I liked the waffle, it was moist and buttery, but the chicken, while flavorfull, was coated in something that made it rock hard.  I also though the pollo was a bit over cooked , but I know most restaurants have to over cook the white meats cause they're scared of undercooking it.  I'd give the chicken and waffles one thumb up.   My date's entree of pork was cooked magnificently, not over done at all, but the pear chips where kinda gross, almost too loaded with taste and the grits that came with them were, in my opinion, inedible.  They were loaded with what seemed to me to be scallion and black pepper.  I was not a happy camper. Usually when I get me a bowl of something warm, mashed up and covered in cheese and butter I'm one satisfied 4 year old.  Not the case here.  Suprised that something could taste so off in a place like this.  However, since I don't have the most mature pallete , it could just be me.  I'm just a white guy that likes to eat :) The pork also recieved one thumb up.  No dessert, but they gave us cookie dough with our bill! Killer!  It had an unusual ingredient in it that I couldn't place, but I thought it was as a finisher, a really nice touch.  The dinner wasn't irrationally priced either!  I might come back, but I don't think I will rush to do so :) Three stars I think. (UPDATE! 1-16-11! FOUR STARS! WTF TOOK ME SO LONG!?!)",

    "text": "So wifey and I decided to check this place out for our monthly date night. It's a cool little spot around 12th st and Oak, in the middle of a neighborhood. The decor is very modern, but warm and inviting. We opted to get an appetizer and a few of the small plates rather than the larger plates they had. They had a balanced but approachable wine list, I had an awesome Tempranillo for under 10 bucks a glass!  We opted for the crispy shrimp and okra for the appetizer, which came with this spicy banana sauce and this cool yogurt sauce.  I really really liked this dish, the okra was great and the shrimp were succulent and perfectly cooked. Not sure about the banana sauce, but overall a great dish. We then decided to get the stuffed dates with crispy Schreiner's Chorizo and Manchego. It came with dressed spinach, prob one of my fave dishes in Phoenix right now!  We also ordered the macaroni and cheese and I forgot to mention the toasted bread and roasted garlic we ordered. The bread and garlic was just okay, nothing special.  I, surprisingly, was not a fan of the mac and cheese either, it seemed very grainy (I know it was chock full of parmesan so that's probably what it was, but it was just unappealing to me). Overall this place has potential. I'll definitely go back, especially because we got out with 3 glasses of wine and 4 small dishes with tax and tip for under $70.00!!",

Perhaps worse is that their best small plate, the roasted baby beets, has been removed from the menu because of exorbitant market prices for local beets.  Still a 4-star experience because of the delicious cocktails, perfect reading room, and Best Front of the House in Town, John.",

    "text": "My experience at the Tuck Shop last Saturday night is consistent with the other poor reviews posted here.  The service we received was extremely poor to the point of being boldly rude. When we tried to add two extra people in our already large party the manager's suggestion was that two people \"not eat\".   Although we said we didn't mind squeezing these people in (at the really big community table) he insisted we couldn't without any explanation. They had no extra chairs I guess??? Regardless, they made no effort to try to work with us.  I admit that we created a difficult situation for the Tuck Shop in that we brought a very large party into a small restaurant whose goal seems to be to create an intimate, cozy atmosphere.  Having never been there, we didn't realize this about the restaurant. They should have explained that on the phone and said they couldn't seat that many people. And really, they shouldn't seat more than 6 or 8 people. It got really load and echo-y in there.   While the waiter was competent, his service was also poor. For some reason he wouldn't talk to the whole table so there was lots of confusion about when we were ordering apps vs dinner. Again,  once I was inside the restaurant I understood the atmosphere they were trying to maintain but a little flexibility does not seem unreasonable.    It seems that if you push the limits of their restaurant concept, as the other reviews suggest, they will absolutely not work with you. The Tuck Shop gets two stars only because the place is cute and the food was pretty good.",

    "text": "I really want this place to be good as I live 2 blocks away from it this would be so damned convenient. The place is beautifully modern, It has plenty of parking which it needs for all the cars I see each day going in and out. My girl loves the salmon they have and the drinks are to her liking. My problem with it is not the wait time while waiting to have a table open but the service I have had when I dined there three or four times I have been there.      I will admit to the last time I went there that I got rude for the first time in my adult life with a waiter as the neglect and bad service seemed to be intentional and I took offense. Every time I have went I have had the same waiter. An older gentlemen who seems to have his share of tables which is the first problem but has a quiet disdain for everyone(never see him smile)mixed with the disability of peripheral vision, or is it a superpower?   I don't have high expectations and as long as someone is fairly decent I will say great service but each and every time I went this guy was never helpful it took 10-15 minutes the last time for him to acknowledge our table for the first time( not after taking a drink order mind you). I wanted to walk out and became a little vocal. Yes he was busy and he was serving a large party but as you are delivering food to the table throw in a \" sorry i will be with you soon\" or jot down a quick drink order. So after that we get a drink order and he's gone again and we are invisible again. I don't know if it's some personal vendetta where he was insulted the first time by me still tipping 20% and that some how triggered a blood debt in his book but it was terrible each and every time. I am hoping when they expand that they will have to hire more staff and maybe I can get a lottery pick of anyone but him. To end the dining experience after waiting and trying to flag the man down once again I went to the bar to ask for the check and made it a note to mention how bad the service was.  That was the last time I went.   So besides the service which I do think is slow not on just his part but at the bar and in the kitchen also, The food is sub par for me and I have had quite a few dishes trying to find the thing that they are special at which I didn't find in my trips before writing it off. Here is a rundown of my opinion:  Service: 0/5 please fire him if you haven't since the last time I have been there (hint hes the guy the never is pleasant and looks like him, well not him but another actor with darker skin and green eyes who played villains in 80's movies): <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Fmedia%2Frm218601984%2Fnm0001424&s=5c1e57b8272c10dcbb58b4045de65114e4d330fd3d20333bdbe0228202c261c4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">imdb.com/media/rm2186019...</a>  Ambiance: 5/5 lovely place and would love to know who helped with the remodel, music was nice and mellow.  Food: Salmon - 5/5 supposedly really good, not a fish fan so my girlfriend vouches for it. Chicken and waffles: 2/5 my order of chicken was burnt, the crust was just a hard shell of black/brown dough, the waffles were nice though. skirt steak: 2/5 like someone dropped a bottle of pepper on accident on it, been a while that is all I remember I think it came with some potatoes that were ok cheese curds: 2/5 ours were soggy,and had a pool of grease at the bottom but the ones with crisp were good. roasted garlic: 3/5 actually not too bad but terrible on the stomach  I had a couple other favorites but never tried the pork sandwich which is known to be great. Home-made ginger ale: 0/5 is strong and terrible",

When we Looked at the place from outside, we automatically knew that it was fitting for what we were looking for, small, but open and well lit but also good ambiance.  There is one large family size table for a party of 10.  The rest of the tables are two tops and four tops. We were greeted as soon as we walked in the door and treated very well.  Now the food.....we started with cheese curds that were very tender and absolutely delicious and very lightly fried. The Mac and cheese is amazing!!! There was no real ingredient  that jumped out at us, the overall combination of ingredients made this a truly delicious dish.  I highly recommend this.  We then had the skirt steak which was also extremely tender, the rub they used had a slight kick to it, but not overpowering. It was served with potatoes and lentil combination, that was simply delicious. The skirt steak was fabulous!  We were not impressed with the garlic and bread for $5.00 and would have been happy with the baguette bread (plain)  but they charged 2.00 for that. Overall I love this place and will certainly be back for more flavor challenges.",

Our server was very friendly and accommodating, so I give them a thumbs up also.  We will definitely be heading back.  Nice job guys.",

My husband and I went on a Tuesday night, but unfortunately they only serve the meatloaf on Thursday. Fortunately, the menu has many other delicious options. We started with the Roasted Beets and Times Mac and Cheese. Both were delicious!   I had the Chicken and Waffles, and my husband had the Pine AZ Skirt Steak for dinner. My chicken was juicy and well seasoned, and the waffles were clearly made from scratch. Yummy! My husband's steak was cooked perfectly, and served with tasty mashed potatoes and mushrooms.   They have awesome drink specials on Tuesday and Thursday, so we will be definitely be back another week to try the meatloaf!",

Not to say it was bad, it wasn't, it just didn't live up to the hype. The space is very cute and warm feeling. I like how the chairs don't all match and it has a very homey feel. The service was also very good.  The BF ordered their home made ginger ale and it was very interesting. It tasted like liquid ginger, which was pretty cool. For food, we started with the nosh plate, which was probably the best thing we got. It had this delicious onion jam type stuff with some crackers, cashews, some meat of sorts, and a really good cheese with dill on it. The onion on the cheese was soooo good. I could have just eaten that for dinner. Then we ordered mains. The BF and I shared the chicken and waffles and our friends got the mac and cheese and the flapjacks. I was not a huge fan of the chicken and waffles, and I was so excited for it! The waffles weren't crunchy at all, which I think would have been nice texturally, and the chicken was encased in the fried coating, but once you cut into it, the fried part just fell off. It didn't adhere to the chicken at all. Also, it was very thick and didn't have a ton of flavor. This was very strange. The sauce on the waffles was good, it was a honey butter or something, and the chicken was moist, but together, it was a disappointment. It did come with some wonderful green beans though.... they were seasoned and cooked perfectly. I tried my friend's flapjacks and thought they were a little strange tasting... but not bad. I didn't try the mac and cheese, but my friend thought it was good.   We finished with a shortcake that has strawberries that were macerated with balsamic and basil and had some kind of cream in it. This was very good, I loved the earthy flavor that the basil brought to the dessert and the strawberries were flavorful and tasted fresh.   Overall, it was good, but not great. Maybe I had too high expectations, but I probably wouldn't run back here in the future.",

You are always greeted with a friendly \"Hello\" when entering and \"Have a good night\" when leaving.  We try to visit at least once a week, and can honestly say that everyone we see receives the same treatment.  John and Laura are by far our favorites, but the entire staff is courteous and always willing to assist.  Oh yeah, the food...the food is fantastic!  We have tried almost every item on the menu, which is seasonal, and have not tried something we did not like.  The drinks, courtesy of Laura, are poured perfectly and always leave you with a smile.    My favorites would be the Shrimp Po' Boys, Flapjacks, and Brussel Sprouts.  My wife is a fan of the Dates.  Make sure to ask what the specials are, as they change nightly.  I don't have a favorite entree, except maybe the Ravioli (special entree), but you will not be disappointed with whatever you choose.

    "text": "I chose Truck Shop based entirely on Yelp reviews as I am an out-of-towner.    Indeed the Truck Shop is on the outskirts of residential, located on the SE corner of a small traffic circle.  Also, the bones of the restaurant are indeed of a 20th  mid-century home.  Having stated the previous, the Truck Shop is definitely retaurant looking from the outside.  The ambiance of the Truck Shop is quite nice.  One gets the feel of a foodie, higher-end restaurant when entering the building.  The layout and tables suggest upscale dining.  I dined with two other companians.  We chose items mentioned here on Yelp:  cheese curds, beets, mac and cheese with Lobstah, chicken and waffles, plus one not mentioned - salmon cakes with prawns.  The cheese curds came out first.  They were roundish cheese balls, lightly coated and deep fried.  The cheese tasted like mozzarella cheese and my two dinining commented that a marina sauce should accompany the curds.  I agree.    Next the beets and mac and cheese lobstah came out.  The beets were good as was the mac and cheese and lobstah.  The chicken and waffles and salmon cakes came out next.  The waffles were served with a maple infused butter.  The chicken was crisp on the outside, moist on the inside.  Again these dishes were good.  I was disappointed that none of the dishes were outstanding.  All of the dishes were good.  This was not a \"Wow!\" dining experience.  It was a good dining experience which is why I give the Truck Stop four out of five stars.",

Is is a gorgeous midcentury remodel and I love it. Great top shelf liquor and homemade ginger beer (they serve Hendrick's Gin as their house gin...need I say more?) I love the homecooking concept Tuck Shop is embedded in the Coronado neighborhood.  I love that it has truly established itself as a neighborhood fixture, where locals walk to dine on a regular basis.  This is a fun, comfortable, upscale neighborhood hang out.  The negatives?  From a food standpoint...important for a restaurant...Tuck Shop doesn't quite get to the finish line.  I think the food is ok, but not great.  I have been to the Tuck Shop a number of times and tried a variety of items on the menu and have yet to be wowed.  My feedback on just about everything I have eaten is, \"It's a little too bland.\"",

For appetizers definitely check out the grilled baguette w/creamy roasted garlic as well as the stuffed medjool dates and the Times Mac and Cheese.  All are delicious!  The Pine AZ Skirt Steak has to truly be the most flavorful and tender skirt steak I've ever feasted on.  I always like to switch up their common offering and get the white cheddar waffles in addition to what the plate normally comes with.  The waffles in one word are nothing short of AAHHHHMAAAZZZINGG.  Mmmm.",

The food was amazing..we had pork with a pasta and broccoli.  The pork had two amazing sauces that my boyfriend I argued over which was the better.  The pasta was okay a bit of a cumin flavor but great once we mixed it with the pork's sauce.  The broccoli was a great fresh touch.   The manager came over and spent some time talking to us more about the menu and plans to open another place with a different menu soon.  A must try if you are a down town kinda person!   The crowd  was a mix of tshirts casual to formal and the patrons ages ranged just as much.  The menu changes with the season so go check it out!  Only complaint I've heard from people I've recommended was the lack of choice if you are a vegetarian.",

My husband and I went on a Friday night around 6:30pm and were seated right away, but had we come any later there would have been a wait.  We didn't get any drinks (I'm too cheap) but I'm definitely going back on a week-day for their drink specials.  We ordered the grilled vegetables and hummus to start (which weren't on the menu) and I'm still fantasizing about them. This was my favorite part of the meal. Then we had the chickory salad, also delectable. I don't even know what was in it, but it's clear that the chefs are creative and great at what they do. To finish off, we ordered the chicken and waffles. This was 100% my husband's doing - I'm not a huge fan of fried chicken, but I was still so satisfied with the starter that nothing could ruin my meal - for fried chicken, it was really good. And I loved the cheesy waffles!  Also, service was great. Fun experience!",

Recently I made a same day reservation for five and much to my dismay, they were unable to accommodate me for the times I needed.  (My error).  They could serve us an hour later.  It was a mid week reservation, who knew they were having a few larger parties.  I begged but no way could they give me the times I wanted.  So, after a lot of back and forth they said it would be ok to come in and sit in their \"living room\" have drinks and starters.  We did that and it was such a pleasant evening as we awaited our table.  As it turned out the large party was delayed and they seated us earlier than we expected.   We ordered our food, were served timely and had a lovely evening.   The food was delicious!!!!   The wine was wonderful......as always.  Thank you to the Tuck Shop for graciously accommodating us.  Best food, owners, and staff.  You are the best.   Always gracious.",

    "text": "We thought we'd be back sooner than this and we were hoping for another good experience. It's was just alright. We ordered many small plates and each of us had an entree with sides. The menu changes so don't expect to get the food you see on Yelp in the photos.  Tuck Shop pursues an aggressive flavor profile on every dish they create, including side dishes, which isn't always a good thing.  It's like paying top dollar to listen to an orchestra where every player is a diva. The cacophony is deafening.  We still think Tuck Shop is okay, but this second visit only confirmed what we thought the first time, which is that Tuck Shop \"over does\" and \"over salts\" everything. We came here because our daughter requested it. We go out all the time and we would have taken a pass on this place, but it was what she wanted. We enjoyed the laid back decor, the cool, ambient music, and we thought our waiter was an adorable hipster. Tuck Shop just tries a little too hard for our taste.  Also, if there is one thing we do not like when going out it is when the wait staff responds to our inquiries with, \"It's really, really good. That's my favorite.\" I don't want to know what a waiter likes. Taste is subjective. Just tell us what is on the menu and answer our questions without giving your personal opinion, because I'm pretty sure we don't have the same palate.  The cocktails are still very high quality. The fried chicken is still cooked to perfection. The green beans are greasy and way too salty--just like last time. Cauliflower gratin with grits was interesting, but had a sour note, and the brocollini it was paired with as sides was also greasy and salty. There is no excuse for that. Allow the vegetables to breathe for godssake.  You don't need to work so hard to make a good impression. This reminds me of the Mindy Kaling routine: a retarded person shows up to lunch an hour early...in a tux. We'd like Tuck Shop so much more if it let the food be great without over dressing every damn thing on the menu.  And why are you so above syrup for the waffles? For reals? I've had meals sitting in the same room where Reagan used to eat in Washington D.C., but I'm no snob. Waffles deserve some effing syrup. Sheesh. For a place that serves sickeningly sweet medjool dates stuffed with Gruyere cheese *and* spicy chorizo, it should be okay to drizzle maple syrup over a soggy waffle that's been baked with cheese inside of it. Strange thought processes going on there. You're trying too hard to be different.  BOTTOM LINE: Great atmosphere, nice/friendly service, good sized portions, fair prices on all dishes--just too much experimentation, grease, salt and seasonings. If you want chicken and waffles go to Lo-Lo's It costs the same but you get twice as much without the fanfare.",

From the tuna tartar, the shrimp small plate, to the chicken pizza, vegetable ceviche, gnocchi, beet ravioli, mac n cheese with lobstah, chicken and waffles. You name it, it was great!

But there it is...this quaint and elegant place that seemed to crank out dish after dish of sumptuousness. The Tuck Shop on this hot, non-touristy summer night was filled with local patrons. I spied order after order of chicken with waffles pass me by and their fall-off-the-bone pork dishes, including their ribs and pork belly. We ordered both at our table and it did not disappoint. We started out with their cheese curbs that are lightly coated with bread crumbs and sprinkled with, I am guessing, Kosher salt. For dessert, we shared their wonderful creme brulee that comes almost as a double order. Oh, lest I forget, I ordered the tastiest cold soup; thickened by soaking bread into the broth and then using the blender. It was a red pepper stock that came with thinly sliced apples and crusty, thinly sliced bread. Delicious! Our waitress was both knowledgable and attentive. We found her to be genuine and a pleasure when she appeared at the table. The only suggestion would be to expand the wine selections, especially the Chardonnay as the only choice was pricey at, I believe, $13.00 a glass. Overall, this is not an inexpensive dinner if you include drinks, but the food is outstanding and we will return again! Bravo.",

Would be nice if they gave you syrup. When we asked for it we were sneered at and told the waffle had it inside it but they would bring us some. The Green beans on the waffle were a weird addition but AWESOME.  Lobster Mac and Cheese - Meh. Lobster was dry and overcooked and the mac and cheese was stuff with breadcrumbs and far from creamy. This was definitely not something we would order again.   Flank Steak - Would have and could have been good would they not have sliced it as soon as it came off the grill. The juices just ran out all over the plate leaving the steak missing a lot of flavor and juicyness. These guys do not have a clue when it comes to proper steak prep. Id never order a steak here again. It had no flavor whatsoever.  All in all this place was a disappointment after a 23 mile drive to try it. The only decent thing was the chicken and waffles and to be honest, we would go to Lo Los and pay half the price if we ever craved it again.",

    "text": "Tonight we (the girl and I) decided to bike around downtown checking out all the chic neighborhoods and dream of where we would live if we could. And we decided to end the night with dinner at Tuck Shop, which proved to be a good choice (as usual).  The ambience is great. The low, wood-paneled ceiling creates a very cozy feel. And the waiting area looks like a living room so you really feel your just going over to a good friend's house for dinner. My only (minor complaint) about the \"over at a friend's house\" atmosphere is the TV behind the bar.  You can't get away with having a bar AND no TV in this town (I understand), but I can still have a small complaint about it.  We started out sharing the cheese curds and the chorizo-stuffed medjool dates. The cheese curds were very tasty, although I wouldn't mind a side of spicy mustard or something. Perhaps red pepper jam? The dates were excellent. A perfect mix of spice and sweet, topped with Gruyere cheese.   I also added a brisket street taco on an impulse, and I'm glad I did. The brisket is cooked perfectly (which they do next door at their other eatery, Astor House). It came with a lime-cilantro-avocado sauce which was good, but I felt the sauce covered up the flavor of the amazing brisket.  Our main course (which was shared, as most plates are and should be at Tuck Shop) was the \"Vovo's Favorite\"- the special of the night-a half duck in a oyster and mushroom au jus, served with a sweet potato cake and grilled grapes. I felt like I was having Thanksgiving dinner all over again. The sweet potato cake was nice and light, and the grapes worked much better than I had expected. The flavor of the duck was excellent. The only problem with the dish was that the duck was a bit dry and tough. I usually expect a much juicier and fatty piece of duck, so I was a little underwhelmed with the texture. Overall I was pleased, and I'm giving them the benefit of the doubt on the duck.  Our server was pleasant and helpful, making sure our wine glasses stayed full. It's hard to beat the overall experience at Tuck Shop. Despite a few minor flaws with the food, I will keep coming back again...and again...and again.",

    "text": "This was the second time my lady and I went to Tuck Shop. The first time we went we had a 5star experience because of the service and the food and after the second experience I felt like writing about it.  The food is unbelievable. We had the roasted garlic, pork belly, tuna tartare, pine steak, and the St Louis ribs. Every dish was excellent and I would have the exact same thing again but when I look at the menu I almost want to just hand it back to the waiter and say bring me what you'd like because honestly everything on the menu looks fantastic.   When the pork belly was served the owner of the restaurant made a comment that she thought the piece that came out was \"too fatty\" for her liking. My lady and I aren't pork belly experts so honestly I wouldn't have even noticed because it was very delicious but because the meal didn't meet the standards of the owner, she sent us home with one, with a very genuine note on the to-go box. And just to be clear, I'm not giving them 5stars because I got free extra food... this 5 star rating is because of the service.  We had a negative experience on this date. When our server greeted us he politely said \"We are very short staffed tonight, so I am taking some tables and handling the bar.\" (This was the bar tender). His inexperience waiting tables showed, as he was easily distracted by other tables who were flagging him down instead of focusing on the task at hand and then moving to the next task. An example of this is as he was bringing our drinks to the table he turned his head to address another table and inadvertently dumped 3 or 4 ounces of a gimlet down the back of my lady's dress!!  Clearly embarrassed and apologetic he ran and got a moist rag. He apologized profusely and removed the cocktail from our bill. We were temporarily rattled and frustrated by this experience but at the end of the day he is just a human who makes mistakes like the rest of it. When mistakes happen I usually judge a man by his reaction to it vs just the fact that a mistake was made. He apologized, he admitted he made a mistake and he didn't blame anyone or anything else for it. Furthermore, the first thing he did was explain to us that waiting tables wasn't his primary responsibility so it's very understandable that a mistake could have happened. It's just an accident and they owned it. The owner apologized as well.   My lady and I will definitely be back and I know that if I ever need to impress work clients with a great meal this restaurant will be at the top of my list along with establishments like Fleming's and Ruth's Chris.",

These were all questions I asked myself the second we met friends here tonight for our first double date in forever! Our reservation was at 7 and within moments of getting there we were seated. Located right off 12th Street inside an old home it fits downtown vibes perfectly.  Cozy, great bar, romantic yet also cool enough to hang with friends. I loved that they had a little living room area with a couch and chairs while you wait for your table. We ordered s few drinks off their cocktail menu. My favorite was number 52 which was Herradura Blanco Tequila. Creme de Cassis. Lemon. Champagne. It literally came out picture perfect! No detail was spared from start to finish. Next we ordered the Charcuterie Board  to share while waiting on our main courses. There were so many great things to chose from, but I decided on the chicken and waffles. My hubby chose the St Lewis BBQ ribs. Our waitress was wonderful, never skipped a beat, was friendly and we never felt rushed in any way. Our food was amazing! I was worried a bit about trying the waffles because I've never tried a waffle with white cheddar, but oh my gosh....HEAVEN! Perfect savory and not overly sweet. I could've eaten them without syrup, but add a little maple syrup and awwww yum! Green beans were a perfect touch and were cooked perfect. Not soggy just perfect. The chicken was juicy, crunchy the right amount of salty. The Tuck Shop Nailed it down to the perfectly wrapped and boxed leftovers. Best date night and meal I've had in ages!",

We had to ask 3 people every time we needed coffee refills. No one would bring sweetener so I got up and get some myself. The same with hot sauce. I ended up getting it myself from the bar.   We had to ask 4 times for the breakfast potatoes that were supposed to come with my sons breakfast. Asked 3 times for our side of bacon.   We were charged for soda waters that were never refilled.   We ordered Benedict's and the eggs were over cooked.   This was an awful dining experience. Awful.   On a positive note, I am blessed to have been able to spend the morning with my family.",

I'm not sure if I ordered the wrong dish, but unfortunately I wasn't too impressed with our dinner experience.  After looking over the menu, there were quite a few starter & small plates that sounded really really good, but because we were super hungry, we settled on two large plates instead. I got the Chicken & Waffles and my husband got the Pork Loin.  I didn't really care for the taste of the fried chicken, it didn't really have any exciting seasoning & the waffles were just okay. Not at all worth the price. My husband enjoyed his Pork Loin, he said it was cooked really well & was super flavorful. I didn't snag a bite but it looked like a filling dish!  As I previously mentioned, I really do think I just got the wrong dish, which is why I ended up ordering a bread pudding dessert. That was good, a bit too sweet with the sauce but enjoyable. I'd like to return to try out some of their other menu options. I can see why others enjoy this restaurant with the ambiance, especially for a date night. Hoping to increase my review to 4, even 5 stars in the future!",

Everything was just delicious, well prepared, amazing. Second time we tried the seasonal eggs Benedict, crab, with house made hollandaise...just hook me up to an IV please.  The atmosphere is chill, warm, homey, and inviting. It's tucked away in a cute historic district and is quiet and calm. Everyone was incredibly nice, and the owner is very kind!

The owner is often found at the bar, welcoming guests and chatting with them. Ambiance is modern-homey to romantic with old sofas in the waiting area. Service is very friendly, helpful and quick.  I love the small plates as appetites, like the stuffed dates and Brussels sprouts. The mac and cheese makes for a full meal and is rich in Bechamel sauce and bacon. The entrees vary frequently and have novel flavor combinations. My favorites are the lamb and scallops.  They have a good wine selection, local draft beer such as Four Peaks and an outstanding single malt selection.  On the desert menu, the creme brulee is a must try.  You can tell from the menu combinations and quality of ingredients that they actually love food.",

We ordered our meals, and of course they were out of French toast which is the reason we came here. I got the bread pudding instead, and it was fine, nothing spectacular. My husband had the pork belly Benedict and he enjoyed it. The waitress seemed like she'd rather be anywhere else but here, and our meal seemed very rushed. Overall, it was pretty pricy for slightly above average food and and below average service.",

We didn't have reservations but even though it was a busy weekend the staff was able to find us a table for two . We both had the full American breakfast and mimosas and at first I thought it was too much food but I wasn't able leave any . It was delicious, tasty and great combination of foods . the staff was very attentive, the place I found to be very cozy and homie , love the music , the ambience very delightful we truly enjoyed our Easter brunch",

    "text": "The Tuck Shop was recommended to me by a very well-informed bartender that I met months back.  I've been slowly working my way through the list he gave me.  Thus far, everything he advised I try has been good.  Thanks Chris!  This is yet another hidden gem in Phoenix.  In this case, quite literally.  I was supposed to meet a friend here for dinner and she drove past it twice trying to find it.  Maybe it has something to do with a lack of directional ability.  I'm not one to judge.  As soon as you enter, you get the strong feeling of comfort and welcome.  I think they do a lot to make the place feel big and inviting.  We sat down to wait for a table to become free, perused the menu, and chatted happily with the other people sitting around in the lounge-type waiting area.  By the time our table became free, we were pretty much set to order.  Strange as it seemed, the wait didn't really seem bothersome.  The server gave us the whole speech that first-timers get (I guess some people still don't understand the shared-plate concept) and we were off.  We ordered a plate from each section (small, large, and starter) all to share and they timed them all well.  Nothing really overlapped too much.  It gave us time to talk and eat without feeling rushed (speed food is a pet peeve of mine, usually).  The best plate was the pulled pork sandwich, a special that is offered seasonally.  I've only recently begun to eat pork again and for this, I'm glad I did.  The meat was so smooth as to nearly melt in with the sweet and savory barbecue sauce they used.  The potato bread roll had just the right consistency of fluff and resilience to hold up the the onslaught of sauce and meat.  Mind you, we still made a mess of ourselves, but we had great time doing so.  Happily, everything leading up to that was pretty amazing too.",

    "text": "I tucking love this place!   My dining companion had been talking up the Tuck for a month before we finally got the opportunity to check it out. Nestled in a converted home in Phoenix's historic Coronado district the ambiance is relaxed yet upscale. But to be honest I had worked myself up into such a frenzy of culinary anticipation I wouldn't have cared if it was located behind a Food City in Apache Junction.   The staff was incredibly friendly but they picked up on the first date vibe we were putting out and kept their distance. The only exception was when I spazzed out and knocked a glass votive off the wall, shattering it. The place went radio silent, then several staff came over, whisked away the mess, and checked to make sure nobody was bleeding. They didn't make me feel like a jackass...not even a little bit.   They also didn't make me feel like a jackass when we ordered enough food for about five people and inhaled every last bite. Here are the scintillating details:   -Cheese Curds - Lightly battered, melty and delicious. No they don't come with sauce! THEY DON'T NEED SAUCE!  -Chorizo Stuffed Dates - Sweet, salty, spicy fiesta in my mouth. Who knew a hot date could be so delicious?! Incredibly simple yet amazing...  -Baby Lettuce Salad - This was so refreshing and light and the flavors were spot on. The crunch of the fennel was perfect with the buttery avocado. I wish I were eating it right now.  -Rosemary Goat Cheese Bruschetta - This was the most unremarkable item we ordered, but still really good. The rosemary and goat cheese paired nicely together and the ingredients were really fresh.  - Lobster Mac and Cheese - Homemade mac and cheese with lobster. No surprises here (unless you count prosciutto), just pure deliciousness.  -Catfish Cakes - So simple yet perfectly executed. The cakes were crispy on the outside and firm on the inside. They had a nice garlic flavor without overshadowing the rest of the ingredients. The quinoa and spinach side was awesome but I was really laser focused on those cakes.   Tuck Shop kind of personifies the man who took me there. Classy, not pretentious. Timelessly stylish, not trendy. The finest quality, freshest ingredients are meticulously constructed into dishes that are new and exciting yet evocative of the very familiar. Definitely a new favorite and will be for years to come!",

This place is modern and cool. You won't have grease stains on a paper plate. Rather you will have a delectable meal that is finger-lickin' good.  I read a lot of reviews of this place before I darkened their doorway. So, kudos to you previous reviewers for suggesting the mac and cheese. That was bomb. Then I ordered the chicken and waffles. I was instantaneously in heaven. The only knock to the whole meal was the braised greens. I have had better, but that doesn't lower my score because they are inferior anyway to the brilliance that sat on the plate beside them.   Also, the wait staff was extremely helpful and patient. Since we sat at the bar near the kitchen, they let us see everything as it come out and were more than happy to tell us what each dish was.   The decor is very modern and appealing. They have gone to great lengths to make sure you know that this place is hip and with it.   I can't say much more other than, you must try this place. You must quit what you are doing right now and go. Drop the pen. Step away from the keyboard. Get up. Put on pants. Go eat at Tuck Shop. Wow- as I wrote that I realized that is a good schedule for my day...",

    "text": "I was jazzed to eat here, but saw a negative review by a fellow Yelper and thought \"hmmmm.....\"  But that guy must have been in a bad mood because I loved it!  I went with 4 friends last Friday for dinner and none of us was disappointed right from the start.  The Tuck Shop is quite literally a shop tucked into the Coronado neighborhood in a quaint brick building.  The inside is reminiscent of  a ski lodge with the decorative wood ceiling runner and cozy lounge that is perfect for enjoying a glass of wine while you wait for a table - and you will wait if you go during peak dinner times on a weekend as the dining room is small.  The plates are designed for sharing, but are still relatively small.  That does however lend diners the chance to enjoy a few apps with friends and still have room to enjoy a solo meal.  We started with the fancy cheese sticks - yum - that come with some sort of a pear dipping sauce.  Interesting....and delicious!  We also enjoyed the grilled baguette with roasted garlic which was a creamy surprise.  The beers are brewed for the Tuck Shop by Four Peaks which was a great treat and all of us enjoyed both flavors.  That was a nice addition to the start of our meal.  We all must have similar palates because we didn't vary much in our meal choices.  Three had the Times Mac & Cheese w/ Lobsta and two enjoyed the skirt steak.  Both were delicious.  I am a huge mac & cheese fan and I really enjoyed this version.  It was creamy and flavorful and the lobster was a surprising and welcome addition!  For dessert we enjoyed the baked apple, and by \"we\" I mean \"I enjoyed\" as I mowed it before most of my friends had a chance!  It was the perfect light dessert for a great, and well portioned, meal.  Plus, my friends were all so happy with the chocolate covered cookie dough balls they were happy to leave me be.  We will certainly be back and I'm looking forward to it.",

    "text": "Goodness...dusting myself off and getting a few squirts of oil before I get started. Oh Yelp, how I have missed you...  In my new quest to schlep my self through as many new dining spots as possible, I was fortunate enough to receive an invite to Tuck Shop from a great co-worker. Aside from the multiple attempts to get the name right prepare yourself for at least one phonetic faux pas on the phone with friends...  You are welomed with a small sign made of kids' blocks...so you know that you are in for a treat. It's like how I would love my house to be if I had a 50's-60's  ranch block. Decent sized bar, various seating arrangements and chair assortments with onr large table  in the middle and a cozy lounge area.   The chorizo stuffed dates with arugala were delish - so simple but the savory crispy chorizo with sweet gooey date and a little melted cheese on top peppered with a small bite of arugala just go so well together.  The mac and cheese was ok...needed salt and pepper and a little more moisture.   We ordered the chicken and white cheddar waffles - but we passed as they were out of  waffles. Instead we went with the red beans and rice with linquisa sausage and shrimp and the maple roasted pork tenderloin. The red beans and rice had amazing flavors with the spicey and sweet sausage with just a hint of cinnamon. Some of the beans were a little hard but it was easy to overlook because everything tasted so good. The pork was ok - the maple and mustard seed sauce was good...almost undercooked but juicy and great flavor. But I have to say the gorgonzola grits really turned me off...I kept thinking my old bikram yoga clothes were under the table or something. Maybe I'll try the grits next time sans stinky cheese.   And yes, the meal ended with tiny little cookie dough balls... Excellent service and tasty zingy gingerale.  I am so looking forward to trying the chicken!!!!",

By far our favorite apps were the Stuffed Medjool Dates and the Duck Tostada. Also tried the mac & cheese (good), cheese curds (average) and poutine (needed more flavor). For entrees we tried the Pine AZ Spiced Steak (excellent), their specials that night (also excellent), and the Pork T-Bone (the only miss of the night - the pork was a little too dry). Portions were good, we were all too full for dessert. Service was great, very attentive and good with suggestions. Overall really liked it and would definitely recommend a try.",

    "text": "We have dined many times at Tuck Shop and had great meals and experiences each time, however, this review is specifically focused around a private party we held there recently.    My husband and I were celebrating our recent wedding with an intimate private party and dinner of about 36 guests.  We rented out the restaurant on a Sunday night (usually closed) and it was a great event from start to finish.  My husband and I both wanted a memorable night that neither one of us had to be too hands on in coordinating as we are both very busy.  Trust me on this, if you trust anyone, trust John.  From the moment I contacted John at Tuck Shop he was focused on bringing together a night that would be special, unique and hassle free for us.  The majority of our menu for the evening was customized, which was another special touch.  We gave John our favorite dishes and wine preferences (favorite dish, favorite wine, etc.) left the rest up to him.  It was definitely worth it as our guest raved about the food!  My 80 year old grandmother said it was the best food she has had at a wedding--how many weddings do you think she has been to in 80 years?--pretty impressive stuff. :)  It was one of those occasions you didn't believe would happen so flawlessly because it took so little effort on my part.  John must've thought I was crazy contacting him the day before \"We are missing something right?\"  He fielded my questions with patience and professionalism.  We were not missing anything!  It was an amazing evening, coordinated to the T, and I would recommend Tuck Shop for ANY private party.  Every person in our party of 36 had an amazing evening.  Tuck Shop was accommodating to whatever we could come up with, and it was a very memorable occasion for all. This is a great venue for any special event and I have no doubt we will be back there again in the future for a birthday or anniversary!!!",

We were warned by the waiter that the portions are huge, but apparently he has never seen me eat before because we cleaned our plates.   We started with the mac and cheese (cheesy, gooey, creamy heaven in noodle form), the medjool dates with brie and chorizo (smokysweetspicy little bites of sin), the roasted garlic with crostini (OK, there's not much you can do to elevated this one from other restaurants, but it was devoured) and wine.   For dinner, we shared the citrus-brined fried chicken with greens and cheddar waffles. Oh my goodness. That was some damn good chicken, Colonel.  The only complaint I had was that I was so stuffed from dinner that I couldn't even fathom the thought of dessert, a rarity for me.   Can't wait to go back.",

The modern architecture and design of the place manage to open in up, but the decor and the layout keep it cozy. As long as they had a bottle of wine under $30, I would have gave the place 3 stars on the ambiance alone. Our server that night also happened to be top notch.  On the ball, helpful and cool.  That can really make an experience.  The food I wasn't totally in love with.  I had the skirt steak.  It was over done and a tad salty for me.  It wasn't bad, I was just expecting more for what we were paying.  The french fries appetizer was delicious, so I'm willing to concede that maybe I had a bad throw of the dice.  It happens.  All in all, the Tuck is a great place for a romantic dinner, and I could see stopping in for drinks when you're looking for more than a tavern.",

The patatas bravas were glorified french fries - I was extremely disappointed with these.  Yes, the mac and cheese was delicious.  I would gladly order this again.

    "text": "Quaint. Comfortable. Homey.   When I first walked in and looked at the Reading Room, Tuck Shop reminded me of being in someone else's home in 1960.  I loved it!  There was a group of 5 of us, they only take reservations for 6 or more so we went earlier than later to ensure a spot.  5:30-- PERFECT.  After work and ready to try some supper.      The server made it sound as if the larger plates were so huge and they weren't really that big.  Between 5 of us we ordered: Panko crusted Walnut Fontina Cheese Dates stuffed with Sausage Times Mac n cheese (minus lobstah) Fish n CHips (special) Fried Chicken and Waffles (with the worst tasting greens in the world) Coriander Pork Loin  Not too shabby-- we each ordered either a cocktail or a Coca Cola Light (from Mexico-- love the bottles and that it's called Light, not Diet)- came out to $27/person plus tip.  That is good!  My only complaint, was that there was 5 of us and we asked if we could order one more sausage stuffed date (that doesn't sound right), so we could each have one and the server told us \"the chef doesn't do that.\"  That's okay, one gal didn't want one anyway.   Tuck Shop's food is homey-- I like it.    The bar isn't fully stocked but, they have the basics.  I feel like I was there for the food anyway.",

    "text": "I meant to write this review a month ago when we went to Tuck for the first time.  We have lived in this neighborhood for over a year and never been. I never even noticed the place even though it is across from Sunshine Market, our favorite go to for craft beer specials.  We were celebrating my boyfriend's new job. He called and made a reservation which we discovered wasn't really necessary on the Wednesday evening that we went.  It was early and there was only one other party there. So there were all of these open tables but we were placed against the wall between an office and some other door. It was awkward. I didn't like that.  But the cocktails and the drinks...oh my. Wow. Incredible. I think everything we ordered was a special dish. We had a Brussels sprout and bacon appetizer that had perfect char but tender and oh so buttery.  My man had the lamb shank which he devoured and proclaimed it to be \"so damn good!\" I had these wonderful seared scallops with a mixed greens salad. I like my scallops with a really crunchy crust from the sear and these were golden and tasty but not as crunchy as I would've liked. But I am picky. The whole dish was sprinkled with little tiny golden chips. I asked the server and she told me they were roasted pear chips!! Are you kidding me? So clever and so delicious.  We shared a creme brulee for dessert. That was perfect. Perfect golden torched sugar crust and this lightly sweet cream underneath. Incredible. Just divine.  It is a little pricey though but definitely worth checking out again on another special occasion just to try the regular menu items. And get a better table.",

I don't know what took me so long to dine here but lucky for me my boyfriend took me out for a little romantic date Thursday night and TUCK SHOP was the spot.  I'm just going to make this quick. The food wasn't bad at all but I think I hyped it up a little too much in my head and it fell short of my expectations. I will add that dining here is more than just eating, it's about the art of the preparation and the beauty of the flavors. Just by reading the menu I could tell that so much time, effort and thought went into creating each dish. I'm still very glad I finally made my way out here and I would love to return and try the steak!",

Ambiance: This is a converted house that has some individual tables and then has some more family style tables. It has a partially open kitchen and a quaint little bar. There is a waiting area that somewhat mirrors and adult play pen or nursery (yes the adult kind).. Games, books, comfy chairs. So if you are waiting to be seated, you can camp out there. It's actually kinda cool.  Food - absolute deliciousness. Starters: Cheese Curds and Grilled Baguette; Smaller Plates: Goat Cheese Salad, Mac n Cheese; For Sharing: Veggie and Ricotta Ravioli, Chicken and Waffles, Spiced Steak, and Salmon and Shrimp Cakes. Surprisingly, I thoroughly enjoyed the veggie and ricotta ravioli the most. I then enjoyed the cheese curds and the baguette.. they smokey dip served with it was AMAZING.  Service - our waiter was a gem. Had an opinion about the menu, offered suggestions, checked on us at regular enough intervals. It was awesome. I believe the thing that made the experience the best was how they accommodated our group without reservations and were honest with us to say that we could be sat as long as we were finished within 2 hours because their was a reservation at our table. I thought that was awesome because they could have easily said \"full house\".. I've been to some places like that.",

The sign was the first thing that caught my eye. Made with colorful toy blocks that made me smile as I entered the restaurant. It is a dainty and intimate restaurant for perfect for a chill evening out with a significant other or friend. My friend and I sat down and decided to order the mac and cheese, taco salad and bbq beef ribs to share. The salad was delicious with the portion being bigger than we both expected. The mac and cheese was good at first but we both figured it to be a little too heavy and salty for our taste. By the time the ribs came out though, we barely had room left in our stomachs. Ended up shairing one rack (4 ribs) between the two of us and packed the rest to go.   I thought the service was okay for how not busy the restaurant was and would prefer to taste more from the kitchen before giving it an extra star. Definitely enjoyed our time there, however, and wouldnt mind going back!",

The chicken was ok but was not something I would go back for considering all factors. Happy Hour should be all days and include weekends (not just at bar or lounge).   One of the owners, Grace, contacted me regarding this review and discussed the issues I presented. Syrup was available and could have been given. We did not ask as we thought this was not included. She will look into the matter of skimpy amount of items on the bread board. I was informed that I could have been given options of parts of the chicken as they are cut into parts . Perhaps the server was unaware of this option. The website should state that happy hour on Weekends is only at the bar or lounge. I do appreciate the contact and investment, interest the owner has in customers...and looks for input for quality assurance and improvements. There are many options for restaurant choices thus this is an important issue. We like to support local vendors. Its a cute and enjoyable place. Happy hour every day please. more clarity on menu and personalizing choices.",

And for $11-16 you'd be sad to not be full -(my bill with tax and tip came to $19 for 4 ravioli and coffee) so spend the extra money and get yourself a large meal (you'll thank me).  But, the quality of the food was beyond excellent and extremely appealing to the eye as well.  A very cute place, snuggled in a neighborhood, great atmosphere, and really sweet waitress!

Another nice touch was their house made mixers (tonic, ginger ale, sour mix & lemonade).   Tuck Shop is a tiny old house converted to a local gem. It's tucked away (pardon the pun) in a Central Phoenix neighborhood and you'll drive by and miss it if you're not paying attention.   We started with a Tito's and house made ginger ale chorizo stuffed Medjool dates for appetizer. The sweet & savory experience was unexpected and very delightful. I almost ate the entire app alone!   For dinner, I ordered the citrus-brined chicken and white cheddar waffles. It's served with spicy grilled string beans. The chicken was juicy and tender and the waffles were surprisingly different. The one thing missing for me was syrup. I asked my server about it. He said the chef wanted to go with more of a dinner dish and that syrup would have been too breakfast-y. Au contraire mon frere!!!! Maple based syrup is part of the the complexity of the dish! Chef could have figured out something a savory syrup recipe! And franky, without it, the dish was on the dry side.   My friend had the Catfish & Crawfish w/ polenta. I didn't try it, but the plate was pretty darn clean!   Enjoy!",

Reservations are the smartest way to go, but if you're just with one person then the bar is more than fine. The reservation system is different (you pay $25 a spot) but it all goes towards your bill and they add on tip. So, really not that weird in the end.  The food is amazing. My favorite entrees are the chicken and waffles and the steak. The waffles are much more savory than sweet and the chicken is super crispy and juicy. They cycle in and out new dishes every few months. I try to force myself to go for new things, but always find myself coming back to the classics (lobster mac n' cheese).   My suggestion is go with people who are cool with ordering lots of small plates and a couple entrees and sharing. There's so many amazing dishes you will want to taste everything you can.",

    "text": "I'd been looking forward to going here for quiet a long time.  I've always found their food to be creative and delicious when I've seen them at various food festivals around the valley.  And the food mostly lived up to expectations.  We had a few of the small plates (the roasted garlic, the stuffed dates, the mac n cheese, the shrimp pati pati, and something else that wasn't memorable apparently).  The shrimp dish was delicious.  I could eat a home depot bucket full of that.  The full entrees that came out looked good as well (the chicken and waffles seemed to be a popular item to split).     The service was a bit overattentive but I won't knock that.  It's such a small place that it's hard for the server to not hover.    The cocktail list is interesting but they only had 4 beers on draft which was disappointing (since the weren't even good beers IMO). They had wine aplenty.    In the end I didn't find the value to be there.  Four small plates, a small app, and 1 drink ran nearly $100 after tax and tip.  It was good, it just wasn't worth it.",

So if you went and enjoyed something and wanted to go back to enjoy it again, you'd have to do it pretty close to the original visit or you may miss it forever.  The menu this time around was still unique and everything sounds so delicious. They have appetizers, small plates and large plates on the menu. My girlfriend and I shared one of each, some wine and dessert! The bottle prices are a little absurd- $70, $90+ and each glass is about $12-20 so our bill definitely added up quickly. But our server, Linda - provided excellent service, and the food was bursting with flavor. Their ingredients are different and from my knowledge local and so fresh.   We enjoyed the salad on the small plates - it was SO GOOD. The beet ravioli, which actually has no pasta in it at all - the beets act as the pasta (and this was absolutely delectable. And as our entree we had some dry rubbed steak with mushrooms and mashed potatoes... and this was absolute heaven in your mouth. We literally were licking our plates!  And the dessert guys... some raspberry bread pudding with fresh whip and whiskey sauce.... wow.   Overall, we spent a little over $100 for the two of us but we were well fed and beyond happy with our romantic and ultra divine dinner and experience. Definitely recommend for a quiet, romantic evening out with a good friend or a date. Not cheap but worth it.",

I didn't taste her chicken so I can't comment on that but for all the food she received, the price was definitely too good. The portions were good size. I'll def be coming here again. Service was wonderful. We had a baby with us and they were very accommodating. I need to find time to come back here again. I wish they were open on Monday mornings so I can take my husband there.",

We needed a date night, and we needed a GOOD ONE. This place delivered. The moment we were seated and the hostess started explaining the fresh, \"from scratch\" made cocktails I knew I was going to love this place. Cocktails are my weakness.  We started out with the Gin Gimlet and cheese curds with the crab ceviche and every single bite was nibbled. Our expectations were defeated, and the flavors had my taste buds dancin!  We split the St.Louis BBQ Ribs which came with horseradish coleslaw and a jalapeno cornbread muffin... pair the 3 together on your fork and you'll wanna slap ya momma! I left happy, full, not-ready-to-go and a feeling of \"when can we come back??\"  Do yourself a solid and make a reservation here for your next evening out!",

A basket of bread would have been nice.  Everything seems al la Carte so no salad before the meal...  The food arrived in a reasonable time but it was nothing special.  The onion rings were not soggy but not crispy either.  The pork was \"crunchy\" and a bit more cooked than I like.  Not most, tender or juicy.  It would be interesting to see how things would have tasted if we had been in an hour earlier - but I am just not that motivated to come back here.",

I made reservations to drop by on a weeknight with a friend and was not disappointed in the least.   We parked in the lot across the street and just walked over and were seated pretty quickly. Service was great and we were able to put in appetizers and entrees at a good pace. The food also came out at appropriately spaced periods so I really enjoyed the dinner.   Now when we went in, we wanted to try like 10 things on the menu. We ended up ordering the cheese curds, gnocchi, portabello melt, and the chicken and waffles. First off the cheese curds were deeelicious! Perfectly salty and definitely one of the best appetizers ever. The gnocchi, which was pan fried, had an awesome flavor and I super recommend it. I personally loved the portabello melt which came with a side rice+corn salad type of thing that complimented it well. My friend who had the chicken and waffles seemed to enjoy it and I did love the small piece of waffle I tried as as well!   Overall, the food was great and service was really good. The interior is quaint, homey, and inviting which is always nice. I high recommend dropping by if you are in the mood for great food!",

    "text": "Wowee my taste buds were so happy last night!!  The Tuck Shop calls their cuisine \"neighborhood comfort food\" and they are right in so many ways. The restaurant is located in a neighborhood. In fact, it looks like an old house and doesn't stand out at all except the small \"Tuck Shop\" neon on the west side of the building. Since it probably was a house at one time, its pretty small. I don't think I saw more than 10 tables. When we arrived, the very friendly host stated it could be up to 45 minutes for a table or at the bar. We stated we'd think about it and surveyed the people waiting and where the guests were at in their meals. The host returned to let us know that the guests at the tables were finishing up faster than he thought, let us know how many were ahead of us, and let us know we could enjoy some cocktails while we waited.  We ordered two vodka lemonades and they were awesome. The menu stated it was homemade lemonade and it was delicious. Not too sweet, not too sour, not too tart, and not too much alcohol. We maybe got 1/4 of the way through our drinks when the host returned to let us know there was room at the bar for us.  Our bartender/server was very friendly and attentive. We like to order a little of everything and share when we try a new restaurant in order to give an accurate recommendation or decide to return. From the starters, we ordered the herbed potato fries with Gruyere cheese and mushroom gravy; from small plates, we ordered times mac and cheese with crispy prosciutto and herbed breadcrumbs and added lobster; and from the sharing menu, we ordered the citrus-brined fried chicken with white cheddar waffles.  The fries were cut steak size and had the perfect balance of crispy outside and soft inside. The cheese had a surprising kick to it. The mushroom gravy was soooooooooo good and reminded me of what my grandma would make.  The mac and cheese was fantastic. I wasn't a fan of the lobster, but I'm not really a fan of lobster period. It was added to the top of it rather than mixed in. I recommend not adding the lobster; there's plenty of flavor with the breadcrumbs and prosciutto. A few bites into the mac and cheese, we started to get pretty full and our server actually asked us if we wanted to cancel the chicken and waffles. No way any other restaurant would cancel and extra sale. We told her to bring it out because we had to try it.  God I'm glad we did. The waffles were fluffy and sweet. The chicken was juicy and tender. It all went together so amazingly I couldn't stop myself from eating it.  I'm happy we got to try so many delicious dishes and look forward to our next visit when I'll only order one item in order to save room for dessert. The people next to us did and it looked phenomenal. We still got to indulge on chocolate chip cookie dough balls that were given to us, rather than mints, with our check. Speaking of check, the 2 vodka lemonades and three dishes came out to about 54 bucks. A smoking deal considering we ate way too much.  The Tuck Shop knew the exact route to my heart.",

    "text": "Finally, after many months after finding out of this place, we decided to go for a date night. It was as good as I had previously read and we intend to go back. My husband feels this place isn't appropriate for take-out food and perhaps he is right. We both had a glass of wine, (husband had two) and started with the grill baguette with creamy roasted garlic/olive oil  and the crispy shrimp/okra. The baguette dish was okay but I am always a sucker for bread dishes. It was $5 but I was just remarking to my husband that at St Francis, they brought us bread with olive oil complimentary. So basically, at Tuck Shop we paid for the roasted garlic. But, hey, I am not complaining...they gotta make money, right? The crispy shrimp and okra was so delicious and I rarely go for the fried dishes. I really loved it. The batter was light, flaky and it came with two sauces (One sweet and spicy and the other an herbed yogurt sauce). I don't generally go for yogurt sauces but really liked this one. To share, we ordered the mac and cheese and the Medjool dates. I don't really like dates but my husband really wanted to try them. Boy, am I glad he did. They were stuffed with chorizo and cheese with a bed of dressed arugula to the side. I could have eaten the arugula for days. It had this oiled, salty dressing that reminded me of the dressing they use on salads at Korean BBQ in Mesa. So good. And not to forget the fig that was also delicious. It didn't have an overly fig taste which might be why I liked it as much as I did. The mac and cheese was really good, too, but not my husband's taste. He felt the cheese was a little grainy but it was reminiscent, to me, of a parmesan sauce which can be grainy. I loved it. It had bits of what I think was bacon and very yummy. I actually had the mac/cheese  leftovers for lunch today and it was still as good. The decor was nice although my husband was a little put off by the fact that it seemed like a higher end restaurant that used paper napkins and put paper covering on the tables. He also felt like with the wide open dining space, it felt like a high end cafe. I can see his points but they didn't bother me. Our bill was approx $57 which for three glasses of wine and splitting four plates, was pretty good. We were very content with the amount of food we ate. The menu wasn't very extensive but that's okay. Like I said, we would definitely go back and try some other things on the menu.",

We've had the same slightly snotty, disinterested waiter both times, but bar service has been a bit friendlier.  Can't say enough about the amazing food. I believe we actually fought over the waffles last time. I'd pass on the lobster mac if i went back, but most everything else was delicious.   Definitely recommend this for a date night. It's the perfect neighborhood restaurant!",

    "text": "I feel like it's been forever since Tuck Shop opened and it's taken me all the way until now to actually go!  That has more to do with the fact that I have the eating habits of a geriatric and like to eat at 4, and places like this don't open until 5.    My first impressions were that this was a very cute little restaurant with homey touches here and there but not without it's own modern flair.  The tables and chairs are all mismatched, but thankfully at appropriate heights.  I liked the faux ceiling that gave the impression that it was lower in the middle, but I can see other people really hating that.  The staff was all friendly and knowledgeable and the guy who I am guessing is the owner had some really amusing shorts on.  The food was wonderful.  There was lots that looked good on the menu to us, and it was too difficult to narrow it down to one sharing plate, on top of the appetizer and small plate we ordered, so we went ahead and got two.  We started with the walnut crusted fontina, and that was delicious.  It was served with a sweet and earthy pear sauce as well as a roasted red pepper sauce.  They were delicious when swirled together.  Next we had the mac and cheese with the lobstah added.  I really liked the mac and cheese.  It was tender with a real down home sauce with just the right amount of cheesy flavor and warmth.  The lobster was quite unique.  It had a great woody flavor that I didn't expect but I found to be really appropriate for the dish.  Finally, I had the citrus brined fried chicken and white cheddar waffle.  It was ambrosial.  The chicken was the best fried chicken I have ever had.  It was intensely crispy and the citrus brine gave it a whole new flavor profile that I was not ready for.  The white cheddar waffle was yummy, but a little too eggy for my liking.  It did however, go extremely well with the chicken,  I really enjoyed my visit here, and I hope to come back sometime soon.",

This place delivers on neighborhood charm, super friendly approachable service, and reliably great and inventive food.  The menu changes seasonally, so just when you find a favorite, prepare to be surprised by a new favorite!  My tip would be to go on slower weeknights to really experience the place at its best, I wouldn't want to compete with Friday and Saturday crowds for a great experience at one of my favorite Phoenix restaurnats.  The Duck tostadas are great, but really so is everything!  Cheese curds are a splurge (calorically speaking), but they're worth it.  Their weeknight wine specials are awesome too.",

    "text": "I like Tuck Shop.  I like when you first walk up to the building, you feel like you're walking into a small day care center (note the building blocks out front). When you walk into the building, you're in a cozy space that reminds one of a hip and modern cabin feel. I've been to Tuck about 3 times now and each time I leave happy.  It starts with the host. There's nothing like being greeted like a regular when you've only been in once or twice. I love how friendly the Host, John, is. On my last visit, we had a group of 7 and we didn't have a reservation on a Saturday evening. John was more than accommodating. He invited us to sit at the bar while he made arrangements to get our rowdy (post beer festival) group in to eat.  The way I would describe the food at Tuck is \"home cooked meals made fancy\". There is a variety of things to try! If you are a vegetarian, some dishes can be made meatless, but not all. If you want something spicy and with a lot of kick, try the red beans and rice. I think that's my favorite dish so far. My least favorite is the chicken and waffle. The chicken was good, and flavorful, but the waffle wasn't interesting to me. I was wishing for some syrup or a cool sauce to go along with the dish. Tuck also offers small plates that are tapas-like. Go for the patatas bravas for a simple appetizer.   Tuck Shop is, in my opinion, a neighborhood jewel. It offers comforting dishes and great drinks, not to mention good service. I have made Tuck Shop one of my regular noshing spots!",

    "text": "I tried to go to the Tuck Shop about a year ago. But it was so packed that the wait for a table was over a hour. I decided not to wait cause i was huunnggrrryyy! About 2 weeks ago. Me and my lady was thinking of a place to go for dinner. She mentioned the Tuck Shop and off we went to try it. The crowd was nowhere near as crowded as before so i was very excited to be trying this food finally i heard so much about. My verdict..it was just ok. I heard the chicken and waffles were the greatest. The waffles tasted a little burnt but they were still good. The chicken was very good. I did like the batter they fried the chicken in. But i'm strange as in i don't care that much for freshly made fried chicken. I love to eat cold chicken the next day after it's been sitting in the fridge and all the seasoning has some time to really settle in. The next day the chicken was very good. My girl got the Mac & Cheese with Lobstah (that's how it's spelled in the menu). I really liked there Mac & Cheese. I highly recommend that. The  biggest disappoint for me was the drinks. If you read my review for The Breadfruit. i went on about the Dark & Stormy drink. One of the things that attracted me to the Tuck Shop was i heard everyone go on about the Dark & Stormy there. There Dark & Stormy is nowhere near the caliber of the Breadfruit. After we had dinner at the Tuck Shop. We went down the road to have a Dark & Stormy at the Breadfruit. I will go to The Tuck Shop again to try some of the other meals they got. So my rating could change. Our bill came up to $50. That was for 2 drinks and 2 entrees. That was about around what i expected to spend. But i was expecting more from The Tuck Shop.",

    "text": "What a wonderful surprise this place is!!! I'm not sure what the name Tuck Shop really means, but my interpretation is that it's meant to reference how conveniently it is \"tucked\" back in the neighborhood.   This place thrives on being clever  yet simplistic. A beautiful house-2-restaurant conversion; it's small and intimate. Beautiful wood tables with mismatched chairs offers a comfortable setting to enjoy all of the comforts this chef has to offer. The wine list is small with a modest selection. Nothing that will rock yo socks off, but hit a home run with the primativo and its price point. Tito's handmade vodka takes the cake for premium liquor selection.   Everything about this menu is simple and clever. From small bites, to medium size appetizers, and a unique Sharing section. The Mac N Cheese with crispy pancetta and lobster was a melt in yo mouth sensation. Although the lobstah (as they would spell it) was a bit small in portion, you couldn't really complain for only a $3 upcharge. The pork tenderloin was a bit overcooked, and the waiter did not ask for a temp preference. The maple glaze drizzle was a nice compliment, but the gorgonzola grits were a disappointment. The grits were explosive in a lick your spoon kind of flavor, but the consistency was too runny. You couldn't even really tell that the base was made with polenta.  Even if you didn't save room for dessert, the complimentary bite-sized chocolate covered cookie dough bites were the perfect amount of sweet to satisfy any after dinner craving without you having to pull out the sweat pants when you get home.",

It's unfortunate they don't take reservations but even though they were busy we only waited about 20 minutes or so for a table.  If you do have to wait go over to Astor House, have a drink and chat up the staff.  The restaurant is small but not crowded.  They could probably squeeze in another table or two but I'm glad they didn't.  The service is excellent and the food is unbelievable.  We shared the Nosh Plate and the Chicken and Waffles.  The Nosh Plate was good but the Chicken and Waffles was absolutely astounding!  The waffles were airy and tasty, the green beans were perfectly seasoned, and the Chicken was to die for.  I'm pretty sure they batter their chicken with crack...it's that good!  We ended the dinner with the triple chocolate cake and that pretty much guaranteed the food coma goodness.  The bill came and it was very reasonable for what we got.  I stayed for business and my wife went home so before I go home I will be stopping by again solo...the wife is jealous!",

    "text": "Tuck is the best thing you can ask for in a neighborhood restaurant.   They value the local clientele with a genuine wink and nod, maybe a handshake or a \"how's yer mom?\" kind of comfortably friendliness. But, if you're not from the neighborhood it's ok! You'll be treated like part of the family anyways.  The head of the house, John, is one of the easiest people to talk with I've ever met. My second visit was a month away from the first and there was not only a \"hey welcome back!\" but a few inquiries about a conversation from my first visit. Visits 3-6 were even better. His balance of friendly and professional is top of the charts. I pride myself on being easily social but this guy can talk to *anybody*.   Don't be afraid to sit at the bar, either. It's small and quaint and handled perfectly. I could swim in their gin and tonics. In fact, I think I have, it's kinda fuzzy.  This is one of my favorite places to eat in Phoenix, and I eat out a lot. It's also one of the smallest restaurants in Phoenix so take that into consideration. Friday night at 7 isn't the time to walk in and expect a table for five. However, I would wait longer here for the experience than I would for a Bianco pizza or a plate of Matt's Big Anything (both of which I'm willing to hang quite a while for!).",

    "text": "What a fantastic establishment. Initially I was a bit nervous about finding something on the menu that I would find to be a good \"value\" (overflavored and priced correctly v underflavored and overpriced). I went w 2 friends to celebrate their graduation and we all ordered a palte and shared each one.  Lobster Mac and Cheease - i've been waiting a year to come back here and try this. VERY creamy, great chunks of lobster, and fantastic taste to it. It was one dish that we all kept picking from Pork tenderloin - this wasvery well done but was still tasty - though that might have been from the garnishment. All in all, it was a good filler with the other two but it didnt explode with tastes from heaven like the other two fried chicken and waffles - this was ultiamtely the most surprising dish on the table. This can either be done incredibly well or incredibly bland, and this was the former. It was all in the spices in breading on the chicken (which was extremely crispy but in a good way) and the savoriness in the waffle batter. We were all blown away by how tantalizing this was Ambiance was great - didnt wait at all (8p arrival on Fri in May), lighting was dim but not dark, we got paid great attnention to and the drink selection was on point and not overwhelming (though it's always tough to pay $5 for a Four Peaks brew). None of us were too full after leaving which is key.   One pt deduction - personally, my stomach did not agree with something i ate (could have been at or not at Tuck Shop, but that was the only meal i ate out at since Tue of that week), and that bug stayed with me for a full day after.",

But now the food. Rich, full flavored, comfort food. I don't think there is a cuisine style here as far as I could tell, just some of the best food around.   Had the fontina crusted with pinko and walnuts, awesome. A potato side dish, damn good I tell you. For the main course the skirt steak, which was some of the best red meat I'm had in a very, very long time.   This is my vote for best new restaurant in Phoenix. Seriously.",

    "text": "Everything about this place is out of the norm in a very good and inviting way. Major points on the curb appeal from rock wall to innovative use of nostalgic wooden letter blocks as signage. The attention to detail is refreshing and appreciated.  The interior is welcoming and the creative use of space is impressive. How does one fit a lounge, bar and dinning area in such a tight space and mitigate claustrophobia? This is worthy of an HGTV episode.  Tuck has done it & done it well!   The menu is just as creative and unique in its own right. I've enjoyed the roasted grape crostini, chorizo stiffed dates, mac & cheese w/lobstah, special meatloaf with potatoes & chorizo and the chocolate cheese cake. All hit high marks for flavor, portion and presentation. The service is consistently impeccable from courteous host to attentive but non-intrusive servers. I always feel welcomed and appreciated!    Tuck Shop is in my top five places I love and enjoy introducing to friends, co-workers, and out of town guests. It holds a very warm place in my heart with many fun and special memories.",

    "text": "After reading a few reviews I was really tricked into thinking the portions would be minuscule. Like french-modern-cuisine tiny, but luckily I was wrong.   I erred on the side of thinking the portions would be small so I ordered us two starters but we could have just done with one. However, they were both drool-worthy. One was the baguette with creamy garlic, it consisted of  6 slices of bread with a whole garlic cooked until it's spreadable covered in olive oil and spices. Basically you scoop a clove out and spread it on the bread. This was good, like drool-on-you-keyboard-good (DOYKG). We also ordered the Nosh plate,a typical melon, meat, cheese and nuts plate. Everything on that was tasty and both would have been great alone, but I'm glad we tried both.  For main courses my gf ordered the mac and cheese with prosciutto and breadcrumbs and liked it. I had Vovo's special which is a rotating special. Last night it was the tamale and tortilla soup. We both liked our dishes and were stuffed. I was a little envious after seeing another couple's dish. They ordered the chicken and waffles. It wasn't your typical soul food style but it looked tasty regardless. We both had wine. Gf had the Rose which she thought was a little dry and I wasn't too fond of either. I had the Tempranillo which I liked but wasn't amazing. That's probably the only gripe, I wish their wine list was deeper.  All in all the place was awesome and a great date destination. Romantic lighting and original decor and architecture, good for conversation starters.  The crowd was older that I expected, not a negative just an observation, although it was a Thursday and that might change on weekends. The service was nice and the free after dinner snack. Chocolate covered cookie dough was like pastry crack and also (DOYKG).  Side note: The prices aren't cheap but they won't break you. Especially if you go to other establishments in the same area. My tab for this meal was $60 which is good I think. Two sides, two glasses of wine, one main course and one small course. Not bad as far as I'm concerned.",

I took a huge hiatus as I was in Michigan for a month and then have been crazy busy since arriving back in Phoenix and transitioning into a new job- I was sad because I thought they would've forgotten me.  I was pleasantly surprised to see that they did not forget me at all.  I love that!  We grabbed some brews and shared the patatas bravas (a personal favorite) and the mushroom appetizer.  The mushroom appetizer was heavy on the cheese but still a tasty bite.  The patatas bravas really never fail- they remind me of my Mom's version of french fries.    I'd highly recommend this place for a date- it seems to pay off in more ways than one.  Always great service and interesting eats- still lovin' Tuck Shop for being in my neighborhood!",

    "text": "I've been to Tuck Shop on three occasions and two out of three times I would give it four, or even five, stars.  The last time I visited, in January, I had a pretty terrible experience due to my nut allergy.  I was joined by my parents, my husband, and his parents who were visiting from Chicago.  We were celebrating my mother-in-law's birthday and chose Tuck Shop because our previous experiences were wonderful.    When ordering, I asked our waiter if there were nuts in the salad I wanted, told him I was very allergic, and he said that if there were he would leave them off.  We continued ordering and everything went well until I had a few bites of our catfish.  I immediately felt my allergic reaction begin, we got the waiter's attention, asked if there were nuts in the catfish, he said no but checked with the chef.  He came back to let us know that, while it wasn't listed on the menu, there were indeed ground walnuts in the crust on the fish.  I explained that I had to leave to go to the emergency room.  As I was leaving with my husband, the manager said, \"Have a good night!\". He had been informed of the situation and I'm sure he didn't know what to say.  But that was just the beginning of my fun Saturday night filled with a delightful Urgent Care staff, co-pays, and loads of benedryl.  Anyhoo, that was that.  I loved Tuck Shop.  All the good reviews are right.   I don't want special treatment but, for the love, can we just all agree that any ingredient which is a common allergy should be spelled  out on the menu?  Erring on the side of drama, I feel like someone has to die from anaphylactic shock before this will be taken seriously.  At the end of the day, I know it's my fault and I should've been more diligent.    So, go to Tuck Shop.  It's amazing.  But, if you have an allergy, don't be embarrassed to be the annoying customer who has to repeatedly mention your food issues to the staff.",

OK, in all honesty, I've been putting off writing a review on Tuck Shop because I love it so much and fear that I may never be able to get a table once the word gets out.   That said, I have been here 4 times already and it's been outstanding every time. John the manager is awesome, as are all the servers. The place is cozy and inviting- it kind of feels like a swanky ski lodge with mod furniture where all your friends hang out. The menu is split up into starters, small plates and larger entree-sized items which are suitable for sharing, but you certainly don't have to. Some of my favs are the fish and chips, the chorizo stuffed dates, the fried chicken and cheese waffles, and the anchovy-stuffed potatoes. They also sometimes have a Bananas Foster dessert that is to die for. Very unique and fresh menu.  For the atmosphere, quality and variety of food, the prices are reasonable, and they have an eclectic and reasonably priced drink menu as well. Combine all this with the fact that I can walk here from my house pretty much ensures a long standing love affair.",

    "text": "Meh is right. This place was a big yawn for me...  I went with a group of 5 (well, 4 adults, one kiddo). This is another one of those places that tries to be fancy and pretty much sucks -- for the price and portion size anyway. We ordered beef stew, chorizo stuffed dates, halibut, cheeze sticks, chicken and white cheddar waffles, and some beers.   First on the beers... They have Four Peaks 8th Street on tap (privately labeled as Tucks Ale or something like that) and I was happy to see this -- I love this beer. However, halfway into my meal my glass was dry and it sat that way for a good 10 minutes. If you've read any of my other yelps, you know I expect a refill promptly, especially if you expect me for forget your marginal service and mediocre food...   When the waitress came around, she asked if I wanted another beer, I said yes. Another 10 minutes went by, me parched, growing annoyed... When she came around again it was clear she forgot all about me, then asked one of my friends if they wanted another beer -- I assertively said YES. She looked at me and proclaimed her sorrow, said it would be right up. Another 10 minutes go by, she swings by and apologizes that they had to change the keg. I understand that -- but between the FIRST and second time I asked, I watched the bartender pour another 4 or 5 8th Streets. But I didn't get one.  As for the food? Super duper BLAND. Come on Tuck's! Fancy (read expensive) food should be an explosion of complex flavor in my mouth. If I have to put table salt and pepper on it just to taste something, you pretty much suck. If we pay $30+ per person and I leave hungry, you pretty much suck. The fried chicken was pretty good, but I've had the same quality stuff from the deli at Safeway.  Overall, not impressed and see no reason to return. If you're taking a girl out on a first date who is more into atmosphere than food -- she'll probably think you are the man. But really, do you want a girl like that?",

My very sweet husband knew I'd been wanting to try Tuck Shop for a while, so he surprised me with a Mother's Day brunch here.  First of all, I love the look of the place.  Kind of a contemporary log cabin.  They have a great little waiting area, very much like a cozy living room.  Their brunch set up was unique.  Not all served by a waiter, not all buffet; a little bit of both.  They had two entrees to choose from so my husband and I ordered both (duh).  The biscuits and sausage gravy was fantastic.  Creamy, peppery, and delicious.  The other entree was crab cakes.  The buffet had fresh fruits, grilled veggies, yogurt and toast.  Loved our mother's day experience here, and we're anxious to go back and try it for a date night sometime!",

While there was a bit of a wait for our table, their lounge felt like an ultra-hip living room and I had no issue taking a seat on one of their couches. John very helpfully navigated us through our wine choices and, before you know it, our table was ready.   Craig, our server, did a great job of explaining the menu to a couple of first timers. A couple of small plates, combined with a shared plate, is definitely the way to go. Mac & Cheese.......with lobster. Do I even need to tell you it was good? Kind of a given, isn't it? It was amazing....cheesy and amazing. The shrimp, veggies and dipping sauces rounded out our starters, with the shocking part being that I enjoyed the veggies as much as the shrimp. That is no small compliment.  We split the chicken and waffles for our shared dinner. I'm not a super fried chicken guy, but it was very good, and I tried to steal more than my fair share of the waffles.   The biggest shock of the Tuck Shop was, \"How did we not know this was here?\"  We may have been a little late in finding this gem, but now we feel like hip, in-the-know locals. We'll be back again, very soon.",

The night we went, there was some concert going on at the little hall (I'm not really sure what it was exactly) across the street, so parking was scarce. The neighborhood that Tuck Shop is tucked away in is cute, and thankfully there were not many parking restrictions that we could see. We wound up having to park a little over a block away, so it wasn't too bad. When we got there, there were several people waiting (a party of two and a party of 12, so it looked a lot busier than it was), but we were seated in less than 10 minutes. Both the host and our server were incredibly kind, funny and outgoing. They really made it feel like they knew you, like you had been there a thousand times before. We started with the Savory Simon Hand pies stuffed with sausage, kale and apple. They were amazing, though I didn't taste the slightest hint of apple. The chorizo stuffed medjool dates were incredible. Perfect amounts of sweet and spicy melded together. I could have madea meal of just the dates and hand pockets. The mac and cheese was really good, but from from being as special as the dates or hand pockets. We then split an entree. We had the Vovo's favorite which was cannolini stuffed with cheese and catfish and topped with more cheese and a green chili sauce. Wow! The flavors complimented eachother perfectly. It was wonderful.  It was an all around perfect dinner, from service, to wine to food. Can't wait to come back!",

The menu is soul/comfort food that is reasonably priced and served up in a warm, hip, atmosphere.  I was with a party of 5 and we split all of our small plates and entrees - each was better than the next!  We sat at a long table that was shared with another party and it felt like we were dining at a friends house.  Our server, Aron, was really friendly and helpful.  Also recommend splitting the $20 bottle of wine.  I think they switch up which varieties will get this \"special\" but I had a cabernet which did the trick.  In all, I wish more restaurants were like Tuck Shop.",

We had the fries with Gruyere Cheese served with a side of Mushroom Gravy . The fries could have been a little thinner, but still delicious !  Mac  and Cheese. I can't get enough gruyere, so loved it for that reason.  Skirt Steak - OMG , trolley the best thing I put in my mouth.  It was a portion enough two or three and I highly recommend trying it .  Grilled Peaches with honey , mascarpone and Pecans- I think this is was what made me fall in love , Like the other food on the menu, simple , fresh and innovative with how the ingredients are used. The mascarpone had honey and cinnamon, I am glad I don't live close because I would eat that every day.  YUMMY !",

Its tucked away (haha) around Thomas, but is definitely part of this new movement of neighborhood joints that I love.  Small, beautifully designed, with plenty of parking- we chilled on a couch for a bit and then found a table. The menu is limited, but that's ok. I was with someone who keep kosher, which eliminated all but a few options (at the end of the meal, we mentioned this and were told that accommodations could have been made to any dish on the menu, shame on us for not asking earlier). Either way, dinner was awesome.  We started with Riesling, beets and crostini off the app menu. A whole head of garlic comes with the crostini...it was great. The roasted beets though were the True star...in a creamy mustard sauce, they were awesome.  Dinner was a skirt steak, mashed potatoes and a blood orange salad. The salad was truly wonderful, with a great light dressing. The steak was good, but I have to say, what the Tuck Shop does with veggies really stands out. If I'd ordered without restriction, I'm sure I wouldn't have ordered them, and I'd have missed out. On a return visit, I might go just with veggies.  The service was really lovely- we had an entertaining and fun waiter who was around just enough. Food appeared quickly, was cleared invisibly, and we never had to look for him. He was a delight.   If I lived near Tuck Shop, I'd be there all the time.",

I was pleasantly surprised at how yummy the dates were. For mains we got the chicken and waffles and skirt steak. Both very good but we were all getting pretty full at this point. The chicken was seriously good. Great flavor and we the one breast was absolutely perfectly cooked. I literally just used my fork and it was like butter. The fiance also found his new favorite beer and the manager spent some time explaining the label and the history of it which was really cool. The cookie balls at the end were really yummy too.

Your hours of operation should not affect the paying customers already there.

I found a parking spot up close so that was a good start to the evening.  The cocktails were stand out special.  My company and I ordered the Pimms Cup a couple of times.  Our wine was great for the $20 dollar price tag.  We had the Cabernet.  The food was delectable.  Tuck shop encourages it's guests to share, which is a great way to taste the menu.  To start we had the Wild mushrooms on short pastry.  The appetizer had goat cheese, sherry, and thyme.  Yum.  Our other appetizer was the Medjool dates stuffed with chorizo and melted gruyere.  Double Yum!!!  We were pleased with the starters.  We shared three main dishes, Fried chicken and waffles, Red beans and Rice with linguisa sausage and grilled Creole shrimp, and finally the Halibut fillet with an herb pesto, lentils, zucchini, and marinated tomatoes.  Aces, all three.  The wait staff was great.  No major errors.  The decor is woody with mixed matched chairs, paper table coverings and paper napkins. (O.K.???)  The lounge area looked nice, which I am sure gets used because there are nine tables in the dining room.  Tuck Shop was a great find.  I like that it is tucked away in an old neighborhood.

    "text": "I really want to like this place.  I do.  The decor has got the hip modern \"restaurant in a house\" thing like The Main Ingredient, only it's more open and had no trouble accommodating our group of eleven (we had made a reservation.)  They have cucumber water, which is awesome and for the most part, everyone's dishes looked good from where I sat. My disappointment came when it was my turn to order.  I was informed that they \"don't really modify dishes because they are going for a specific style and flavor.\"  I worked in restaurants for 15 years.  Trust me, I get it.  You don't want me to modify the heck out of something then say I don't like it.  But unfortunately, I have some medical issues that make it difficult for me to digest more than trivial amounts of fats.  I was informed by our server, South, that I couldn't even get the dressing on the side for a salad.  They don't even have a regular grilled chicken breast.  I asked for his recommendations and the only thing that sounded remotely healthy was the vegetarian gnocchi (the regular has sausage) and I asked for it with very, very little oil in the pan.   So, our food arrived and everything looked great.  My boyfriend ordered the Mac and Cheese and said it was good.  Then the gnocchi arrived.  With a puddle of oil in the bottom.  Then my friend's dish arrived to my left.  Lo and behold, there were grilled vegetables on the plate (with what looked like oil on them, but even that would have been better.)  Why not just offer a side of grilled vegetables?  How hard is it to do things a la carte?  Not being one to complain or send things back, I ate what I could of the gnocchi, pulling pieces off of the main dish and putting them on one of their share plates so I could pat the oil off of them before eating them.  About a half an hour later, I began to feel ill. I know I could have been a jerk, made a big stink, asked for the manager, etc but why ruin everyone else's good time?  I've been a restaurant manager, I hated getting yelled at because one of my servers was pretentious and entitled and was too lazy to see what the kitchen could do.   So, if you don't have any special dietary needs and you like to be treated like you don't know what you're talking about, go to Tuck Shop.  Otherwise, I'll stick with The Main Ingredient and ask for a slice of cucumber in my water.  At least they put dressing on the side.",

    "text": "I just went to the Tuck Shop for my birthday and yay I love it!  A friend recommended it to me and always being one to try new, local places I thought it'd be perfect for my birthday dinner.  Not to mention they were one of the few places that actually accepted reservations (for parties 6+) on a Friday night.  So 10 of my friends and I tried the Tuck Shop for the first time and I think we all walked away extremely satisfied!    My initial impression was one of joy.   It's a great location in Central Phoenix.  Love the decor, simple but fresh.  In no particular order, here's what I have to say I appreciated about my first experience at the Tuck Shop:  -great ambiance -knowledgeable, attentive and friendly staff -waiter previewed foods by our table as they were coming out and he was walking them to other tables  (ingenious, pretty sure we ordered everything he showed us!  good sales technique TS!)  -sufficient and close parking  -we were seated exactly at the time of my reservation (that never happens!)  -constant flow of people but never felt overcrowded -could hear each other speaking, good background vibe -cucumber water  Ok, now on to the food review! I did Yelp it first (of course) to see what people had to say about this new find and what should be consumed.   We started with appetizers, pretty sure we ordered 1 of everything.  Roasted vegetables (not on the menu) were my favorite.  Red pepper hummus was delicious.  Lavosh and plum chutney were very tasty as well.  The cheese curds, oh magically transported me back to the midwest (I'm from Iowa originally)... yes, that was good cheese!     Now on to the main course.  My friend, mom and I decided to split 2 entrees between the 3 of us.  Wish we would have known that 1 entree would have been plenty!   Portions were quite generous.  We ordered the chicken and waffles, because surely Yelp could not lead us astray, right?   The second dish we ordered was the Pork T-Bone with broccolini.   The chicken and waffles came first, so we all dug in excitedly.     Yelpers... I'm a little disappointed, I must say!  For as rave of the reviews that were there, I think my expectations were a little too high.  Well, let me clarify  - the waffles, ooh the waffles!   Yes, I agree with the collective Yelp voice...they were divine!  White cheddar with maybe a cheddar sauce on top?   It literally melted in your mouth.  If you could get it to your mouth, that is, because they were so soft and fluffy they fell apart on your fork  (not complaining about that at all, just letting you know what to expect).  The chicken...well, again, I'm from Iowa originally.  I grew up on a farm that raised chickens, so perhaps that plus the Yelp reviews had my expectations utterly and ridiculously off base.  Or did they?   I thought the chicken was dry and hard to eat.  We had to ask for a steak knife.  For chicken?  A steak knife?     The 2nd entree was the Pork t-bone.   Well, I sampled a bite of the pork and it was delicious.  Where we lacked in the first dish, I think the Pork T-Bone made a full recovery and then some.  But by then we were all so full that we just boxed the entire entree up and it's still sitting in my fridge. Maybe I'll do a leftover quality review tomorrow... however, the sample of the potatoes and pork do leave me salivating a little as I write this.     The rest of the group ordered the following: red beans and rice, tamales, finger sandwiches, salad, and mac & cheese (hold the lobstah).    I tried a bite of the mac & cheese and it was tasty!   Everyone seemed to enjoy their food immensely, I think it was clean plates all around.    So, would I order the chicken and waffles again?  Waffles are tempting, but I don't think so.   Would I go back to the Tuck Shop again?  Most definitely!!!   Creative menu, great ambiance, delicious food overall.   I'm in!  Love it!",

Oh yah, the Pine Steak, is also fantastic and will probably also cause addictive like tendencies.   Oh, oh, oh...  the chicken and waffles are also a pleasant surprise in the other wise repetitive and ordinary dining scene that is so often found in Phoenix.   Just do yourself a favor and go check this place out. And try the home made ginger ale, tonic or lemonade by them selves... or mix it up with one of their top shelve spirits.",

We sat at the bar, the service was fast and friendly. I had the cheese curds as an appetizer. They were pretty good, nothing to write home about but much better than run of the mill mozzarella sticks! We shared the chicken & waffles entree. We were very underwhelmed. It was overcooked and the flavor was just not thats good. How about some syrup for my waffles! They went overboard on the seasonings/herbs. I believe it was rosemary but it could have been something else. Perhaps it's my ghetto upbringing but I would rather eat at Lolo's chicken and waffles any day!",

Regardless, visions of cheese curds dance in my head, and the smell and taste of the fragrant and fresh salads tickle my fancy still.

So, while the prices on this menu weren't exactly Denny's, or even Macaroni Grill, for that matter, the experience and quality more than make up for it, thereby placing it in a category In Another Galaxy, Far Far Away. If you enjoy the corporate, droll, scary birthday singers of the former mentions, well then go there & save your 20%. That being said, sometimes you have to fork it over (ok a cheap shot at humor) to experience True cuisine.  Upon arriving at Tuck Shop at 6:30 on a Saturday night with no reservation, we were warmly greeted by what appeared to be the manager, not sure why I'm saying that, just a hunch. The construction of the restaurant was either a former house or reconstructed to look like one, complete with a family room filled with books, coffee tables & art to the side of the dining area. I don't know why a reviewer felt that this restaurant didn't offer privacy. There were several options of seating if you did not have the bigger parties occupying the large, banquet like seating in the middle. We were immediately addressed by our server, who went over the menu, took our drink order and brought them very quickly. We decided on the Spinach Salad with parmesan tuiles, caramelized prosciutto & shaved roasted sweet potato. I think there was some sort of light citrus dressing, amazing. The flavors were so complimentary and it tasted totally natural & unprocessed, yay. Then, we shared the bread with the roasted garlic, hmmmmm. Even the olive oil tasted high quality! Then, on to the Vodka cream sauce ravioli stuffed with cremini mushrooms & veal, wow. My girlfriend & I shared this all & it was perfect for us, though neither of us have very large appetites. However, we were STUFFED. I asked the bartender to add a shot of vodka to my \"homemade\" lemonade, which was perfect. The lemonade reminds me of the fresh not too sweet variety I used to get with my family on summer trips to Mexico.  I just couldn't order dessert but there really were only 2 selections. I think our server was Cray or Gray, something like that, he was awesome, so professional & very easygoing. Attentive to times we were in conversation as well, would just do what was needed & carry on, nice touch. Will definitely go w/ my hubby - that place is right up his alley! hope we get Cray, Gray, Clay???? again.........",

    "text": "The Tuck Shop website does not do it justice. I looked at the website (mainly at the menu) when my boyfriend suggested the restaurant. I wasn't sure what kind of place it was I thought it might have been a divey type place with a good menu. That was the impression I got from the style and quality of the website at least. I don't know I just think all black with high saturated colors say lack of class.   Well anyway that is not what the Tuck Shop is like at all!  It is a wonderful comfortable and elegant restaurant.   We ordered three apps and one small plate that we shared. The Brussel sprouts, stuffed dates, pork and tomato jam sandwich, and the pot pie. Every thing was seasoned well. The dates and sandwich get five stars. We love our Brussel sprouts but would not order them again. They seemed a little over cooked to our liking and the burnt onion kind of overwhelmed all the flavors. It was a little dark and until my last few bites I didn't realize there were nuts in the dish. The Chicken pot pie was good, except for the fact they put a sprig of rosemary in it for garnish and the rosemary kinda took over all the flavors. The Ginger Ale tasted like a gingerbread cookie and was not the refreshing beverage that I hoped for.  The dates were awesome, sweet and succulent with a great chorizo stuffing. The sandwich had no flaws as well. It had perfectly cooked broccoli (another fave of ours) and a fantastic cheese sauce on the plate as well.  The one thing that stopped me from giving Tuck Shop five stars was the service. I observed that it seemed to just be our waiter. I observed the other waiter and he was spot on. As we were seated I heard him asking for another tables drink order and he advised of what the house specials were and told them of the house brewed ginger ale. I was very interested. When our waiter came for our drink orders he just asked what we wanted to drink. I paused waiting to hear everything available and he just looked at us. We ordered the ginger ale. The waiter stopped at our table several times to fill our water and never asked us how everything was. We were feeling a little ignored. Our empty plates stacked up a bit as well. The same thing happened when it was time for the desert order as the drink order. He asked if we wanted desert and just looked at us. Then he questioned if we wanted desert again. And we said we don't know what do you have. He offered two deserts and we declined.   Service was strange and I observed the other waiter and he seemed to get what he was supposed to do. Maybe it was us, maybe we were dressed too casual? Maybe we had horrible breath or BO?Maybe the waiter has never really worked at a nice restaurant?   Great place would not hesitate taking anyone there. Great for a first date. They have a great communal table. And we were out the door at $50.00.",

I love this place, it has that hidden bungalow house vibe that you can find a lot all over Austin, TX. Very hip and trendy feeling without being pretentious. The wait staff was very friendly and attentive without being all up in my business. It was great. I got the Chicken and Waffles dish which is one of the really popular items on the menu and my buddy got the cheese curds. Cheese curd weren't anything out of the ordinary with flavor but they were as solid cheese curds could be without trying to add any additional flavor flare to them. The chicken and waffles delicious. The chicken was cooked very tender. The flavor of the breading again not out of this world but there was something about it that just made it feel good, just like they describe it, solid comfort food that really is the perfect description because thats how you feel when you eat here and my favorite part the green beans. Now those were seasoned to perfection! I really like this place and I can't wait to try everything on the menu!",

I had a steak (med rare, the favorite) with bread crumbs and this type of creamy cheese sauce on top. It was so juicy and soft, basically dissolving in my mouth. The chocolate bread was great also. I'm not a fan of chocolate but the bread was lighter than fudge but heavier than cake, perfect amount of sweetness.   The only thing I wouldn't get again would be the pasta fries.

Another thing I like about Tuck Shop is the availability of small plates and large plates of entree-type items.  If you don't have a big appetite, you are not constrained to a few appetizers; you can get a substantial meal in a smaller portion.  This makes so much sense and I wish more restaurants would do it.   I noticed that Tuck Shop is now selling tickets to those who want to reserve a specific dinner time.  The ticket prices is deducted from your meal.  I totally understand and endorse this practice - why should the owner be stuck with a bunch of no-shows?  However, I was surprised that over and above the ticket prices is a 30% charge for service and tax.  Tickets for two @ $20 each + $11.98 service fee + tax = $51.98.",

We received our appetizer before we received our drinks, which were ordered first. When the drinks did arrive, all cocktails were tasty. However, someone ordered a bourbon with \"a couple of ice cubes.\" We later saw on our bill that he was charged $2 extra for the ice. Mind you, this was normal ice. Not a specially made craft ice cube. Just regular ice. The manager explained to us that this was normal practice for restaurants and the extra charge was to cover the extra half ounce of bourbon poured because of the ice. Didn't make sense to me last night, doesn't makes sense to me now while I write this. Dinner was good even if the portions were small.  Overall, I probably won't dine here again. I could forgive everything if they'd served us our drinks in less than 20 minutes and if they didn't charge us for ice.",

Small spot in an old home and tree lined Phoenix neighborhood with several misted decks and an open kitchen, art on the walls. Warm staff who have lot's of pride in their chef and selections. We all loved our food. Great omelette, Quinoa , squash salad with moist tasty salmon, prime rib sandwich.  It is close to the Phoenix Theater and Phoenix Art Museum where we were headed next.",

First of all, out of all of the restaurants I visit nationally and internationally, the Tuck Shop still reigns as my #1. This team understands the art of the dining experience. From the beautiful smiles, warm greeting, and the intimate family experience. By the way, Lee, Grace, Georgia and Jennifer are truly the best. You have my heart, but the chef takes my breath away! I call him the \"Culinary Innovator\" who understands the art of infusing \"love\" in every dish. Thank you Tuck Shop for your existence! You're always on my mind:)",

I hope that they get some outside seating. I would love to sit outside and enjoy the weather while I can.  I am really hoping that they purchased the little house next door. I drive by the place every day and someone is in there working on it and I did see paperwork from the city about serving alcohol outside stuck on the door a few months back after the house was sold. *Squee!!* I will be one happy lady if that's the case!",

If you are on a diet, this may not be a good choice.. The mac & cheese especially with lobster a diet killer. If you're being good don't despair, the salads are amazing. This week, I love the baby lettuce with fennel, avocado, & pomegranite/orange vinaigrette. If you want to drink your dinner, the wine selection is affordable and robust.

My only complaints would be the uncomfortable wooden chair I sat in with no padding and the waffles that came with the fried chicken. The waffles had hardly any crispness to them and tended to break down/dissolve throughout the meal. But the chicken and green beans definitely made up for that. My wife ordered a pasta dish with scallops which was one of the specials that night. She really enjoyed it. Overall, we loved our experience from the service, to the atmosphere, to the amazing food. We will definitely be back.",

    "text": "So we don't normally wait until 5 for dinner so it is really hard for us to make it to Tuck Shop.  Thankfully, we were off this past week and were able to finally go on a Friday evening.  We showed up at 5 and we were pretty much the only ones there for a while.  Big positives for having the baseball game on in the bar & for our waiter being pretty awesome.  I had seen in a tweet that they had a BBQ pork sandwich that I just had to try and it was really the only thing on my mind.  All of the nonsense about sharing and tapas was completely lost on me.  We did order what amounted to fried cheese sticks.  They were okay.  They were made with fontina cheese and the sticks were pretty good but the sauces just didn't do it for me.  One of them was even pear-flavored.  Ugh.  The wife also wanted to try the mac & cheese with \"lobstah\" so we got an order of that.  It was pretty good but was served too hot.  I know that sounds weird, but the cheese was all runny when we got it.  It wasn't until we were about finished that it turned into a creamy mac & cheese.  Too bad.  All of those complaints aside, I really didn't go for that stuff.  I went for the bbq.  Considering I had tried about 3 different bbq porks over the previous three days, I was beginning to consider myself an expert on the stuff.  The Tuck Shop bbq was wicked good.  It came with sweet potato fries that rivaled Fez (they were even cinnamon-sugary too).  The sauce was a bit spicy and really wasn't needed considering how juicy the pork was.  Really, it was great.  It was a special though, so don't show up looking for it on the menu.  Finally, we finished out our meal with a German chocolate cheesecake.  I'm not sure why I ordered this; I hate German chocolate and I can't eat cheesecake...but I ate some of it anyways.  It was so good.  Really one of the better desserts I've had.    To top this all off, I had ordered some lemonade which was actually really good.  I guess they make the syrups there in-house and, while not a traditional lemonade, it was pretty damn good and had free refills.  No complaints there.  Next time, I'm getting the ginger ale.",

I don't usually like curds but I couldn't stop eating these, maybe its the quality of the curds.  Very simply seasoned with salt and pepper.    The dates stuffed with chorizo and cheese were interesting and good.  Served on a bed of arugula which went well with them, though I would've needed more of the greens if it was all me.    Grilled baguette was interesting - came with a bowl of oil with a roasted garlic bulb.  You dig out a piece of garlic with the spoon and kind of smear it on the bread.  Not too bad, but I think it could've used some tomatoes or something..  I prefer plain old garlic bread.    The chicken and waffles were good - the chicken was awesome and I could do without the waffles so they evened out to good.  The waffles were crumbly and I didn't like the seasoning on them.  The mac and cheese we ordered with lobster.  The bites with lobster were good, the rest was just bland.    The skirt steak was pretty good.  Came with mashed potatoes and had gravy and mushrooms on top.    All in all, the food is creative and fancy but more down to earth along with the price.  I would recommend taking a date here to try new things without breaking the bank.  The decoration and atmosphere is modern, clean with a bit of antiquety.  The drink specials are surprisingly good for a restaurant like this.  Will definitely return.",

    "text": "I have been so excited for Tuck shop since I heard from my Phx peeps that it opened (prob like 2 years ago!), and was anxious to try it out when in town last weekend.  First of all, I love the location in a random not-yet-gentrified neighborhood. The space itself is really cool - they renovated an old house and put in a big community table surrounded by smaller tables. Off to one side is a little mid-century modern \"living room\" with hip furniture and some old timey toys and knick knacks (for instance, those things that are filled up with water and you push the button to force the little pieces of glitter or whatever's inside there up and try to fit it into some little point-scoring area....kind of like underwater pinball...not sure if you know what I'm talking about, but my grandma used to have a bunch of those things that we would play with). The menu is small, and about half devoted to tapas, with the other half for entrees. For tapas, we had chorizo stuffed dates (I don't like dates), ropa viejas chili (loved it), mac & cheese (very good, but not great), and garlic bread (do not order this unless you are seriously into garlic. it comes with a whole thing of garlic cut in half and roasted on the side.....and that's it!). For the entrees, we split the chicken & waffles and the red beans & rice. I did not like the red beans, but others really did, so I leave that as a personal preference. The chicken & waffles were really good, though. The waffles are cheesy, so not sweet, and the chicken is fried in a spicy delicious batter.  The free dessert of a cookie dough bite is a cute touch at the end. Best of all, I thought, were the cocktails. Ok, actually, I'm very pregnant and I didn't have a cocktail, but they did make me a 'citrus soda' from their house sweet & sour, and it was really delicious, and not too sweet. Others tried to the house made ginger ale, which was extremely ginger-y, as expected. Bonus points for a really good beer list at excellent prices ($4 kiltlifter every day, and $3 at happy hour!)",

    "text": "The list of Tuck Shop awesomeness keeps growing. Three words: \"ginger ale\" and \"dessert.\"   Each are worth every calorie!   I had always skipped dessert here because the novel cookie dough bite was enough to satisfy; but, then, I had a bite of someone's cake here and it was fantastic!   So fantastic, the memory of it compelled me to encourage a dinner companion to pass on dessert at a northeast Scottsdale (we're talking practically Fountain Hills) restaurant and make the trek to Tuck Shop JUST for dessert!   Unfortunately, it was a Monday and they were closed so I had to go with an alternate. Point remains: the dessert inspired the drive. Keep sharing your food and save room for dessert!",

    "text": "What a magnificent restaurant! After four exceptional visits, I decided it was time to show some love. The food is a knockout, the service is always friendly and attentive, and the atmosphere is pitch-perfect. I always feel like I'm at a great dinner party in the fabulous home of a great local chef. Let's talk food: 1. Cheese Curds - Basically the best fried things ever. At $5, just get them and laugh at the idiots eating something by the same name at Culver's. 2. Brussel Sprouts - I can't remember the exact description, but they were crazy good. My boyfriend and I actually had to bargain for the last spoonful. 3. Stuffed Medjool Dates - That perfect melding of sweet/rich/spicy/salty. I wanted more, but I maintained my composure because the entree arrived as we ran out. 4. Pork Tenderloin - This was perfection. Tender/perfectlycooked/juicy/flavorful/gorgeous grilled tenderloin. I thought I'd had great pork, but I was sorely mistaken. The sweetness from the date butter was just unbelievable. I've had my share of pork with some sort of apple concoction. That's all fine and good, but nothing has ever come close to this. I can't wait to go back to have this dish again. 5. Chicken & Waffles - The ultra-crunchy breading on the most perfectly cooked piece of chicken ever. As a boy from Kentucky, I can't say that this was the best fried chicken of my life, but it absolutely ranked among the greats. (Actually, I might give the crown to Arrogant Butcher on their fried chicken night). The white cheddar waffle is unlike anything I've had. Crazy addictive and strange. Highly recommended 6. Ribs Special - So here is where I felt that I could have passed. They were very good ribs, but they weren't in the realm of Earth-shattering. Although, I am unfairly comparing them to the best joints in Memphis. 7. Bread Pudding - silent weeping with one hand raised to the heavens. Praise. 8. Beet Chip Spinach Salad - What fun! Just loved the balance flavors and textures. Great salad to get for the table and share.  The thing about Tuck Shop is that they take a food that you think you know, and they make it better than you thought it could ever be.",

This little swanky couch and coffee table are inviting and we can't wait to sit down. The host brings us a couple drinks to enjoy while we wait for the rest of our party.   Everyone arrives, plus one. The staff happily accommodated our need for an extra setting and brought us to our table right away. Service throughout our evening was top notch. Our waiter seemed to know when to check on us and when to leave us to it. He provided the kind of service I hope for.   They don't serve Redbull and Vodka? Is this trending in downtown? Ok, I'll try their freshly prepared Ginger Ale. I added vodka and it was delish. Make it a double!  Every morsel of everything we ordered was AMAZE! Brussels Sprouts, Roasted Beets, perfectly tender street tacos, 'Lobstah' Mac n Cheese, Arancini and Chicken and Waffles! We were pigs and happy to be so.   The food was impressive and the atmosphere was warm and lively. Generally speaking, I'm a 'louder than most' person. This place was happening and I was able to laugh and chat at my normal boisterous tone. If you're looking to read a newspaper while dining this isn't your spot. It's not a 'library' and that's a great thing!  Cookie dough dessert was strange. We saw it in the menu and were all curious. Then they brought them out with the check. We laughed and laughed... They are exactly what the menu says they are 'mini cookie dough bite'. It tasted just like a bite if cookie dough.  I have my eye on a few other menu items; I'll be returning soon!",

Their drink menu has a good selection of beer and wines and we each enjoyed the ones we got (I got the red triple zin FYI).  Their food menu isn't lengthy, but what they do make, they make exquisitely.  A great fit in the exploding downtown food scene.

The real star of the show here is the food. Simply amazing. I love how the menu is partitioned. The dishes come in appetizer portions for sharing, which means you can sample a good part of the menu in just one visit.  Cheese curds: You cannot go wrong. Lightly battered and fried in NEW oil; yes I can taste and see the difference!  Pea Shoot Salad: A revelation. Pea shoots? Bacon? It works! And the parmesan tuille is the stuff of legend. I normally don't order salads in restaurants, but this wins me over. A must try!  Beef Milanesa: Simply put, one of the most flavorful dishes on the menu.   Beet Canneloni: Tastes like a dessert! Wonderful!  Tuck Shop is one of the finest restaurants in Phoenix to take a date to. Hurry! Go!",

The answer is a hearty - YES!  I've been here a total of three times and they are simply consistently awesome in every way. Firstly, service is top notch. If you have a wait to be seated they have an awesome waiting area where you can sit down and order a cocktail, or you can grab a drink from the bar and wait in the outdoor seating area.   The food is unique, well prepared, and the menu changes regularly which makes me want to keep coming back. Ingredients are always fresh (even the seafood which was a concern of mine).   I really enjoyed their prixe fixe Valentine's Day dinner menu. Even though we got sat at the bar (last minute reservation), the experience was still just as good. Our bartender was super friendly and attentive.   Looking forward to their next menu and many more awesome nights!",

This restaurant is located in outside neighborhood of Phoenix and we definitely were a little confused when driving down blocks of homes. The Tuck Shop just sort of pops up on you and looks like it could be a large home. But don't let outside appearances fool you, the inside was cool and sleek and the food was no joke.  I was there with three other people and so we were able to try a bunch of appetizers. Our waiter was the type I always hope for, friendly and with great depth of knowledge of all the dishes on the menu. Based on his recommendations we ordered the cheese curds, the grilled baguette with roasted garlic, the roasted brussel sprouts, and the piece de resistance the stuffed Medjool dates. All of these appetizers were awesome! The baguette literally came with an entire garlic bulb in olive oil and was incredible. The garlic was roasted to perfection and spread like butter over the toasted bread. The brussel sprouts were also really delicious, they were lightly charred and caramelized with a delicious white wine and mustard glaze. The nice addition were the crushed almonds, they brought additional crunch and texture to the dish.  Without a doubt though, the best appetizer was the recommended dish from Best Food Ever on the Travel Channel. The stuffed Medjool dates were filled with a combination of chorizo and gruyere chesse and cooked to a sweet finish. The sweetness of the date was balanced by the spicy chorizo and the cheese made the entire dish creamy and long lasting on the palette. These dates were the best things I ate that night and possibly the best dish I have tried in Phoenix to date.   After our appetizers I moved on to my dinner order. Unfortunately, they did not have the recommended fontina stuffed meatloaf so I went with two other options. First, the Times Mac & Cheese with crispy prosciutto, breadcrumbs, and oh yeah, the up-charge of $4 for some lobstah! Not just lobster, lobstah...hipsters. The mac and cheese was creamy with al dente pasta. The prosciutto added the needed salt to the dish and well, yeah there was lobster. Cooked well and really tasty but I'm not entirely sure I'm sold on the combo. I know that the trend is out there to make this down home dish high class but I think you can make it decadent without adding lobster. But this is coming from the guy who had a caviar mix-in for his mashed potato bar at his wedding, so who am I to judge.  My last dish was the big recommendation from our waiter, the Pine AZ skirt steak. Those who know me well know that I am a sucker for shirts steak and mashed potatoes. Skirt steak was one of my favorite mom cooked dishes so I am a good judge. This steak was rubbed with a dry rub and then cooked in its own juices. It arrived super tender to the point where a knife was almost unneeded. Topping the steak were sauteed mushrooms that added a nice earthiness to the dish. Along side the steak were creamy parmesan mashed potatoes which added some needed salt to the entree. Each individual piece of this dish worked well individually and combined and I was more then happy to try them each way. This was a great recommendation by our server and even though I had so much before it, I had no problem cleaning my plate.  The Tuck Shop was a great choice for our dinner that night even if it was a bit of a trek from our hotel. Next time I am in Phoenix I will go back again and I recommend that you check it out too. Great service, nice decor, and good food made for a memorable dinner.  Overall Review: 7/10",

It's great for a group that wants to share a bunch of appetizers before ordering their meal. We loved the zucchini fries, cheese curds, gnocchi, and tartare. The Mac and cheese was amazing and the chicken and waffles will knock your socks off. I got the #southerngirl cocktail and loved it.",

    "text": "This is a review I wish was going to be different, but here goes... I've been looking forward to going here for quite a while, but was less than what I had hoped.   Let's start with the ambiance, which is great. It feels very cozy and warm; you feel like you're at a friends house just hanging out.   Next the service; our waitress was nice, but she seemed to hover by the bar and rarely made it to our table to check on us.   Now the food and drink...  The beer selection was limited and the wine selection quite pricey for this small restaurant, but it's easy to find something you will enjoy. I tried the oatmeal stout, yum!  We started with the potato and parsnip poutine; the cheese was greasy and flavorless, the potatoes and parsnips were not crispy, and the mushroom gravy was severely lacking salt.   Next, we had the fried chicken and waffles. The portion was generous, but the waffles were soggy (which I assume was due to the addition of cheese or maybe too much egg?) and honestly they could have used more flavor, a bit on the bland side. Although, the chicken was very crispy and crunchy, it had little flavor. I had to ask for hot sauce to start enjoying my meal. Oddly enough, my favorite part of the meal was the side of crispy green beans, they were delish!   I really wanted this place to be great, but was sadly disappointed! :(  I might go back to see if some of the other food is better or if it's just a bunch of hipster hype.",

This place could possibly become my favorite restaurant in Phoenix!  I went with 3 friends for NYE dinner. Only 2 of us had dined there before. Instead of entrees, we did a series of small plates: Cheese curds- 2nd best dish of the night  Stuffed dates Ribs Lobstah Mac & Cheese (their spelling, not mine) Brussels Sprouts Arancini And our favorite of the night: Beet Crudo ravioli - best dish of the night.  Creme Brulee  All perfectly seasoned, fresh tasting, and delicious. The beet ravioli was amazing -  bright, rich flavor!  My only negatives were overlooked lobster, and the choice of chorizo with the dates was a bit overpowering, but still good.   Round all of that with a great mix of cocktails, and a wonderfully attentive staff, and you have a True dining experience!   Thank you!",

The atmosphere is simultaneously casual, but somehow formal. I get the distinct impression that these people take pride in their place.   The cocktails are excellent. Expect to pay somewhere in the neighborhood of $10 for a unique creation. The appetizers and small plates seem to always draw me in more than the full size entrees, and are always exceptional. The cheese curds have the classic squeak to them, and the mac and cheese is in the running for the best in the valley. Try the risotto balls or, even better, the risotto. Appetizer plates start at around $10-12. Expect to pay more for entrees, starting in the low $20 range, with the majority being in the mid $20 zone.   If you want semi-formal but casual and intimate atmosphere with very friendly professional staff and a well thought out menu that does not overwhelm look no further.",

    "text": "Fantastic food, a surprisingly robust libations and wine list, and a cozy, genuine vibe inside. The waiting room reminds me of my grandfather's house, which I do mean in the best way possible. Tuck Shop does a great job of making you feel right at home, not only in its motif, but also exuded in its understated yet attentive service.  The chorizo stuffed dates, cheese curds, beet-sauce ravioli, gnocchi, chicken and waffles, and pork & hand-battered onion rings all come highly recommended. Not to mention the pork belly (new addition to the menu)... good god that was transcendent.  I don't remember the drink list being so...significant the last time we visited Tuck Shop, but I'm glad they've put some noticeable effort into that area of the menu. On this occasion, we were a party of 7 and we all got drinks, so I was able to sample most of the house cocktails. They were all creatively developed and deliciously balanced. Very nice job, barkeep.  My only suggestion would be to add 1-2 drinks that feature a more prominent taste of the main spirit in the mixture. However, I just happen to like booze-heavy cocktails and I realize that is mostly a selfish suggestion. The drinks they feature now are already wonderful.",

    "text": "Tuck Shop didn't disappoint. Good, bold and brave flavors to match their funky interior, an environment you wouldn't guess existed looking at it from the outside.  Why go there: For one, the place is different, the food has a good array of seasonal goodies that could satisfy a small or large appetite with their apps, small plates and large plates. Fun things like cheese curds that remind you of the great greasy nuggets offered at a state fair was a good opening, pairing it with a nice pint was great for this warm weather.  One thing that surely stood out was the bold flavors of the dishes served without and extra fancy pretentious theatrics, each dish had clear distinctions of what was in it.  From starters to dessert, everything was on point. Most importantly, the owner of the place, Grace is present and bumbling around Tuck Shop, talking to patrons, new and returning. The best touch to compliment how hard the back of house was working. She played the role of our Sommelier this evening and found us the right wine after 4-5 tastings of a few that fell flat for us.  Don't miss:  If you start with a beer, share some cheese curds!  The Mushroom risotto was one of the most memorable dishes I've had in a very long time. The Raspberry Croissant bread pudding with a sneaky good whisky sauce was a treat. That came with a sweet story about how that was Grace's mother's staple for holidays in their home, a nice personal touch.  Overall: Tuck Shop is a place for great food and conversation, it's relaxed and personal. Give it a shot, try not to rush through dinner there and try many of the small plates!  Tip: Reservations will save you, and they take them for 2!  Bon App!",

I've been here twice so far and have not been disappointed.   My favorite things on the menu are the mac & cheese with the added lobster option. This is the type of mac & cheese that is so creamy and delicious that you won't want to share, it's so good you can't stop eating it. The stuffed medjool dates are also a great choice, the combination of chorizo and gruyere are fantastic. As for the entree, you really can't go wrong with the chicken & waffles. The chicken is cooked perfectly and the breading is full of flavor. The waffle is savory made with cheddar, dense in flavor but fluffy in texture. The green beans served with this dish are crunchy and fresh, and a nice addition. Their cocktails are also delicious, my favorite has been the Pimms Cup. As for dessert, the goat cheese brownie was to die for! Who knew that goat cheese would make such a rich and flavorful dessert without overpowering it with it's flavor, it really worked!   The only thing I wasn't a huge fan of were the cheese curds, I thought they were kind of bland and needed some dipping sauce or more flavorful breading, they were pretty one dimensional. I still highly recommend the Tuck Shop, their menu is seasonal so every time you return there is always something new to try.",

Most recently I was here on Valentine's Day and it was amazing. There was a special menu available along with their usual menu. They have mixed drinks and a wonderful wine list as well. We had one of the specials, Chilean sea bass with a crisp and fresh slaw, sweet and savory fruit salsa and corn cakes. We also had the Pine AZ rubbed steak cooked medium and it was juicy and succulent, it is served with lentil mash potatoes, which make a usual comfort food interesting. It was delish!

I suppose we should not have ordered dessert and coffee because we stayed over our time limit of 2 1/2 hours according to the owner. They asked us if we would move because we stayed 10 minutes over at the 2 1/2 hour limit. What a sad disappointing end to what should've been a beautiful evening. The food was absolutely wonderful and our server Monique was fabulous.  If you do go here watch your time because you can't go over 2 1/2 hours.

    "text": "We ran into this hidden gem trying to find Duza's cafe for breakfast.  I couldn't believe how yummy everything was.  The place looks like a house outside and inside it has a small amount of seating and a cute little bar. There is also a front sitting area where we enjoyed craft cocktails while we waited for our table.  We ordered the Brussels and Chorizo stuffed dates as appetizers to share for four people. But was just enough to keep you satisfied before dinner.  They both tasted delicious.   I picked the Portobello melt for dinner and I swear it tasted like a burger. I wasn't able to finish it but the serving size was just right. I want to come by and try everything on the menu!!",

The place has a fun relaxed vibe. I ordered the crabcake benedict and my son had the kid's menu cheddar waffle. He didnt like the waffle so much but i enjoyed it however after a few bites the cheddar cheese became too much in my opinion. My benedict was delicious! We also order the bread pudding as a dessert and it was lovely. Would love to come back to try their dinner. Not giving it all 5 stars because i feel it is a bit overpriced and i wish there was more of a selection.",

I absolutely love the ambiance inside this small restaurant and loved the cute flowers and candles that were on our table. They had a decent selection of wine and fun cocktails, which my friends and I enjoyed. To start we had the charcuterie board, which had some meats, cheeses, almonds, grapes, french bread, and more. Also, we ordered the beet crudo ravioli, street taco salad, and shrimp piri piri. My favorite was the shrimp piri pri out of all the small plates we ordered. I highly recommend it! I ordered the tuna tartare as my main dish, which was very flavorful!   All my friends raved about their food! We had a big party, but the service was great. I loved that they didn't rush our dinner, so we took our time enjoying each course. After dinner we had the chocolate cake and creme brulee that were both delicious.   Our group took pictures in their cute living room area and hung out after dinner there. Love this hidden gem!",

    "text": "First time at Tuck Shop, based on daughter's recommendation. She's a chef and knows food.   We arrived at 7 PM on a Friday night, without reservations and we were seated right away. There were three more empty tables.   Between the four of us, we ordered two apps (Mac N Cheese and Potato Skins), a glass of wine, an iced tea and four entrees (the special Yellowtail with Celery Root Puree, the Steak with Lentil Mashed Potatoes and two specials which were Meatloaf and Scalloped, Chipotle/Chorizo Potatoes).  It came to $138 or about $35 per person. That's about right for good comfort food.   Our server was outstanding. She explained the menu, specials and offered advice. She kept our glasses full and was pleasant.   Food: Yellowtail was good but way too much Puree. There was thrice the Puree to fish. The steak was good. Good smoke, cooked just right. Again, huge portion of potatoes. The meatloaf dishes were good but the chipotle sauce was used liberally and overwhelmed the dish.   Good food at the Tuck Shop, they just need to temper the accompanying items.",

I am so glad that this was an amazing place to stumble upon.  Based off of the setup/atmosphere/vibe, it is exactly what most restaurants aim to be.    You would think that the Tuck Shop was an exclusive restaurant where you'd have to be on a guest list for at least a month.  Definitely make reservations, I'm just saying the homey/intimate vibe it has makes it truly one of a kind.  Salmon with risotto; bacon mac and cheese with lobster added; the ribs - were all a hit.  And the cocktails were all handcrafted and exceeded my expectations.  I will be coming back here for sure, and have already been telling my family about the Tuck Shop.    We felt like we were lost coming up to the restaurant because it somewhat resembles a house and it's in the middle of a neighborhood!  Such an amazing idea for location.  See my photos for more of an insight of what we had, I fell in love with this spot!",

After reviewing the menu and listening to several drink recommendations from (who I think was the owner) I chose to go with a #10. All of their drinks are made from scratch with fresh ingredients and quality liquors. I also had the baguette with garlic olive oil to start. Both the drink and the baguette were fantastic and come highly recommended.  After this I was torn between the tuna tartare and lobster Mac and cheese but chose to go with the tuna tartare, after a recommendation again from the owner. I paired this with a glass of one of their Sauvignon Blancs. This is where things got a little bit rougher. After waiting about 20 minutes with no word on when it would be out, the bartender(who was new but courteous and kind) checked with the chef who realized he had forgotten to make it. 10 minutes later it was delivered to me. Portion size was quite nice(you could share it between 2 people), the tuna was tasty and the vinaigrette was bright.  My next plate was the pork tenderloin with onion rings. Again, for being one of only 4 or 5 people total at the restaurant I felt that the time that it took to get the bar from the kitchen was a bit excessive (again around half an hour). Now I love to take my time while eating and make an experience of trying new places, but it was just left me there for about 25-30 minutes after my tartare awkwardly alternating between my wine glass, my phone and the TV that was on an AMC movie before my food arrived. The pork was juicy and flavorful, the glaze was a nice touch and there was plenty of it. The onion rings were fresh but lacked some seasoning IMO. Also there was some green that had been grilled also plated with it that I couldn't quite place.   They do have a dessert menu, but it does change every day so they don't have it on the menu itself. The two choices for the day that I was there was a chocolate moose, in a chocolate cookie with whipped cream and fresh fruit or a creme brulee. I opted for the chocolate moose. This again took awhile to be delivered. While the mouse itself was quite tasty, the fruit was fresh and bright and it was real whipped cream, I was quite disappointed in the cookie. It was hard, dry and tasteless(the only thing I didn't finish on the night).  I saw the portion size of the creme brulee and wish I would have chose this instead. It was plenty to share for 2 or even 3 people.    Overall worth a stop for date night. Food was well  above average but had some rough spots at times as well. Kind friendly staff made up for a slow kitchen (I couldn't imagine being there at a busy time). It was a nice meal, but not a place that I absolutely must go back to. Total for my meal and drinks was 66 before tip.",

    "text": "We've been to Tuck Shop a few times and had great experiences. The restaurant is located in the Coronado Historic District in Phoenix, and is carved into what was an older home.  It's really cozy inside and has a nice layout that doesn't make you feel too cramped even though the space isn't too large. It has a small bar area that doesn't overwhelm the rest of the place but can make for a packed evening on a busy night.  The menu is focused, with a one sheet that goes top to bottom with starters, smaller plates, entrees which are listed as \"for sharing\", and desserts which are aptly named \"finish\". I don't think that you can go wrong with sharing an entree, but they aren't so big that they would be too much to handle for an individual.  It's tough to nail down exactly what is best, because everything we've had has been very good. Some things we've liked are the cheese curds, stuffed dates, chicken & waffles, pork tenderloin, and the skirt steak.  Bonus points for the cookie dough morsel they give you at the end with the check, even if you didn't order a dessert. We'll definitely be back to eat at Tuck Shop again.",

    "text": "OK, how can I possible expound upon my fellow Yelpers!?  I LOVE this little place.  It's nearly perfect.  Let me start at the end: FINALLY!  FINALLY someone gets it, and has opted to try what I have been telling my friends for years...if a restaurant would just give you a little something, a tiny chocolate, something to end the meal, it would be perfect!  And damn, if Tuck doesn't deliver!  I loved my meal, and my 7 other friends were absolutely blown away by the quality of the food.  But I have to say, the most wonderfully suprising little dish is the Quinoa Cakes: crunchy, flavorful, light, and unusual...all my favorite things!  And for a girl from Wisconsin, I was pleasantly surprised and delighted by the Cheese Curds.  Y.U.M.  And I agree with Jen R. when she states that \"just about everything about this restaurant feels good.\"  The lighting was perfect and warm, the furniture, modern, the service was incredibly prompt.  And Tuck was part of a very happy night for me!  Thank you, Tuck Shop!",

But tonight marks the third time I've been since the change in owners. And, really, it doesn't have a whole lot to do with food (though it's not quite the same and I miss Johns tonic). But the customer device is awful. It feels like we are intruding when we walk in...that's the greeting and the tone. And that's weird, cause it's always been such a great neighborhood place. And really sad, because I've lost my favorite place in Phoenix.",

    "text": "Went here in August with the Supper Club for a 6:30pm dinner. This place was hard to find as it's located in a residential area. I passed it several times because the exterior doesn't look like your typical restaurant facade - and there is a school down the block! I must admit, I yelled at my GPS several times for seemingly directing me to the \"wrong\" place each time \"she\" said \"destination!\" - ha! I got a prime parking spot in the small lot next to the restaurant (there is a larger lot across the street).  We were a group of five and were seated in less than 15 minutes. The interior is rustic and for some reason reminded me of a log cabin in Canada - go figure. This is not a large place, so this and the dim lighting added to the rustic and cozy ambiance - a good place for a date.   Our waiter was very attentive and met every need. We ordered two bottles of wine and the following food items: 1) cheese curds; 2) rosemary goat cheese bruschetta; 3) mac and cheese; 4) summer gnocchi; and 5) veal meatloaf.  With the exception of the bruschetta, my impression of everything we tasted was \"Wow!\" The cheese curds had just the right balance of creaminess from the cheese and saltiness - no sauce needed! The mac and cheese was unlike any I've tasted, not made with typical cheddar but a mix of white cheeses. The veal meatloaf was very flavorful and moist. My fave is the summer gnocchi - I remember thinking this was the best gnocchi I've had thus far. The gnocchi had the appearance of being pan-seared, and the tomatoes and basil really added to the \"summer\" and fresh taste.  We spent a good two hours here, and although our bill for the food and bottles of wine came to under $100, we paid $150 - our waiter even told us we paid too much! lol A place that provides great food, service and ambiance deserves the extra $$.",

    "text": "What a great find! Our last night in Phoenix, we were looking for somewhere to go. It was late and a couple of our picks were already closed, luckily I took a look at our hotel's reco'd places and Tuck Shop jumped out at me. Naturally we consulted Yelp and we were on our way.   An unassuming building on a quiet street, you may never know what wonderfulness is inside by passing by. Upon entering you immediately feel the vibe of the place. A bit homey, a bit classy and totally upbeat. A bunch of wooden tables with mismatched chairs, a long communal table, a corner lounge and a bar is simply decorated so that the True star of your visit can be in the spotlight...the food.   Our friendly waitress explained that the menu is designed for sharing, which I love, and is split into 3 sections: Starts, Smaller Plates and For Sharing. We ordered 1 from each.   Starts: Fries and Gravy. A sophisticated version of the diner fries with brown gravy and mozzarella I used to order back in the day. This was an awesome dish! Potato and parsnip fries, with melted Gruyere cheese served with a side of mushroom gravy. I have never wanted to pick up a bowl of gravy and drink it until I tasted their mushroom gravy. It was amazing! The mixture of fries paired with the cheese and gravy was just perfect.   Smaller Plates: Mac & Cheese with prosciutto and herbed breadcrumbs. Yum! I loved the texture and smokiness that the prosciutto added.   For Sharing: I've never had Chicken and Waffles before and when I saw it on the menu I knew that's what I needed to order. The white cheddar waffles were unlike anything I have had. They were airy and light and so flavorful and delicious! I could have had a huge plate of those waffles and been super happy. The fried chicken was incredibly juicy and crisp and wonderful.   We didn't order dessert, but you automatically get chocolate chip dough balls, which is such a cute idea! Now I am left wondering how I can get them to open a location in Queens.   Everything was great. Nice selection of wine and beer. The service and atmosphere are great.",

Drink: Spicy rum and homemade ginger ale. - This tasted amazing, although it reminded me of Thanksgiving. ($5)  Appetizer: Duck Tostadas - great flavor, a little difficult to eat with your hands (wouldn't recommend ordering on a first date), wasn't sure about the plum dressing, but the flavor was good enough that I would order this again.  Small Plate - I am not a huge mac and cheese person; but I was won over.   Sharing Plate - Beet Cannelloni; this was simply amazing. Would absolutely order this again. The color and flavor combinations were so surprising and delicious  Dessert - Only opted for the complimentary cookie dough; which was perfect to signal the end of the meal.  I left feeling very satisfied, and the service was really friendly. I recommend sitting at the bar. The bartender actually brought dishes by so we could see them as we ordered since we told her this was our first visit. She was very thoughtful.",

    "text": "I've been wanting to try Tuck Shop for a while now and finally got the chance when my husband and I went there for dinner last weekend. Unfortunately, they did not live up to my expectations. I liked the vibe of the place but I wouldn't really say it was as homey as people make it out to be. For example, I liked the mismatched wooden chairs but they should have put some cushions on them to make it more comfortable. You know the cloth padded kind that you tie onto the wood spindles on the back of the chair? Just a suggestion. And it was pretty loud in there. They need some rugs or something to soften it up help with the noise level. The staff was friendly but it felt more like I was in a trendy bar rather than a restaurant famous for homestyle comfort food.  Of course the most important thing is the food and on that score only one out of the three dishes was a winner. I ordered the pork tenderloin. This was suggested by our waitress as one of the best things on their menu and boy was she right. The pork was fully cooked but still juicy and tender. And there was a lot of it. Even better was the sauce... sweet and fruity but not too syrupy. The menu said it was a ponzu sauce but it didn't have that umami flavor (which is good since I don't think that would go with pork). And I really enjoyed the spinach that was sauteed with green apples. You wouldn't think those two things would go together but all the flavors on the plate really married up beautifully. Hubby got the special which was a ribeye. Normally that is one of his favorite steaks but this one was pretty fatty and just didn't have a good flavor to the beef. He also didn't really care for the seasonings. And the only other thing on the plate was some sauteed onions, in spite of the fact that it was almost $30. We decided to order some dessert and went with the chocolate chip cheesecake. This was a mistake. It was pretty unappealing when it arrived looking sort of gelatinous and wiggly. It was served warm (like warmer than room temperature) but yet it didn't seem to be an NY style cheesecake that had been baked. Actually what it tasted like was just butter and sugar whipped together and had started to melt. The crust was made from shortbread cookies rather than grahams and had a coconut taste to it that was very off-putting as well. Even the \"chocolate ganache\" topping that the waitress had described to us was too thin and watery and tasted suspiciously like Hershey's syrup. I can honestly say that it was the worst cheesecake I have ever eaten and that is including frozen store bought.  I might give them another chance at some point in the future but I just wasn't wowed by the food the way the other reviewers seem to be. Sorry Tuck Shop.",

Grab a spot at one of the long rustic, communal tables and order one of their homemade Gin & Tonics - yum! Then have fun browsing the unique menu and ordering up some yummy dishes to share.   3 things not to miss:  1) Gin & Tonic - its not your average G&T! Tuck Shop makes their own tonic, so the drink has a lovely warm bitter flavor.   2) Beer Battered AZ Cheese Curds - they're perfectly crunchy on the outside and creamy & gooey on the inside!  2) Chicken & Waffles- This is definitely one of the larger dishes on the menu, and great to share. The chicken is crispy on the outside and juicy on the inside - perfectly balanced with the sweet waffles drizzled with warm syrup.",

    "text": "This was a major disappointment.  We ordered Cheese curds. Greasy and bland. Nosh plate would have been better if the only thing offered was the salami. The onion pickle was way too sweet.  The herb farm cheese had an Indian spiced flavor. At this point I'm not sure how all these flavors can cohesively compete. And that's it!  They can't.  Mac n cheese was grainy and not hot enough.  The chicken and waffles was very disappointing.  The waffle was difficult to eat with a fork. I cut it and it kept crumbling. The white cheddar tasted like it was a powder...the kind you sprinkle on popcorn. Not good.  The chicken tasted over brined mixed with the breading, it was competing. The one dish I did enjoy was the skirt steak.  Perfectly cooked, nice mushroom gravy and mashed potatoes. We finished with a chocolate and caramel cake. Good but not great.  I liked that it was not overly sweet.  It was a little dry. The service could have been better. It took some time to get drinks and to order.  The runner had no clue who ordered what. Slow on drink refill. The table could have been cleared before we received our cake. We had to ask for forks for the cake.  It was a cool space.  Too bad the food just didn't do it for me.",

    "text": "When they say neighborhood, they aren't kidding, literally in the Coronado residential neighborhood at 12th street and Oak, the restaurant lives in an old building that once housed the Arizona Showmen's Association. The rehab has been lovingly restored by its owner DJ Fernandes who is also not by coincidence an architect. When pulling up you can see such attention to detail and design from the concrete stamped handicapped spot, to the interesting lights and exterior brushed stainless door pulls. When entering the building be sure to check out the signage made up of letter building blocks, clever and grounding. Rehabilitation like this helps make the Phoenix area so interesting and original.  The inventive menu was designed by DJ, his girlfriend Jessica Ruiz and chef/consultant Mitch Hoverman, who interestingly also opened Palette. The idea is to share plates amongst a group of friends, though you can easily put together a traditional 3 course meal if that is what suits you best. We opted to share our plates so we could try as many as possible. To best describe the menu it would be eclectic, with Creole, French and Spanish twists. There are 3 sections to chose from, Start, Smaller Plates and For Sharing, the menu is accessible and interesting.  Starting things out, while the grilled baguette ($5) might sound ordinary, its crispy and light goodness comes from Simply Bread. Accompanied is a whole head of roasted garlic and finished with Bariani olive oil. The Bariani is essentially liquid gold with its grassy mild and pure unfiltered flavor. If there is any left in the bowl when you're done don't let the waiter take it away, it's to precious to be wasted and will taste great on just about anything. Together with the nosh plate ($7) it's all about simple clean flavors. Salted melon, Molinari &amp; Sons salami, manchego cheese and toasted pistachio's were so delicious it was hard to share though there was plenty for all. Panko walnut-crusted fontina ($6) was perfectly crunchy and with each bite the melted strands of the fontina cheese were delightful and satisfying. Patatas bravas ($5) are classic tapas however the Tuck version turns potato cubes into long thick planks served along side of 2 dipping sauces. The planks were lightly crispy and well seasoned, though dipped into the aioli and the spicy tomato sauce together was good, love came from dipping into the remaining Bariani olive oil.  Working into the Smaller Plates menu, the panini bites with prosciutto ($9) were so good we were squabbling over the last piece. A nice slab of ciabtta bread stuffed with grilled pear, taleggio cheese, arugala and honey was a sweet and savory combo that has to be tasted and savored. Order 2, one for the table and another wrapped up to go for lunch the next day. Another contrasting sweet and savory small plate would be the medjool dates stuffed with chorizo and topped with melted gruyere ($9). I've had many of stuffed dates, but never like this, spicy and sweet, chewy and meaty, very nice! The mac and cheese with crispy prosciutto, topped with breadcrumbs and lobster ($12) was sublimely creamy and tender, like a really good hug where you just melt into his arms, bury your face into his chest while you're enveloped in comfort and security. Who knew mac and cheese could make you feel so good?!  Turning our attentions to the citrus-brined fried chicken ($17) was a sight to behold. 3 large, generously battered pieces of deep fried passion caused instant salivation. I have to say that this was the juiciest tenderest fried chicken I've ever had the pleasure of sinking into. The crunchy coating, the moist flavorful chicken and the slight citrus after taste were absolute perfection. Along side was a large white cheddar waffle, slathered in maple butter and a bowl of pork laden collard greens. The waffle had a light, fluffy and almost mashed potato consistency that was fork tender and soaked up the chicken juices easily. The collards were nice and porky with that slight bitterness only tempered by salt and sugar.  This plate was simply amazing!  For the beef eaters there is a spiced skirt steak ($18) served with parmesan lentil mashed yukons and mushrooms, that was so hearty and delicious, I can't imagine having this anywhere else.  There is usually only one way to finish a good meal like this and that's with my favorite self proclaimed food group, chocolate. We all tore into the chocolate brownie and almond cream ($7) with a vengeance. You could tell with each bite that this was no box mix, crackly shininess on top, moist and crumbly, this was a great brownie. If this is too much you will also a receive a 1 bite postre with your check. On this night it was raw chocolate chip cookie dough with a slathering of melted dark chocolate, happy ending!  The stars are aligned for the Tuck Shop. With all of their elements in near perfect cohesion, this will soon be one of the coolest and freshest places to eat, drink, and of course share.",

    "text": "To say that this place was a disappointment is an understatement. We have tried unsuccessfully two times before to go there for dinner. Tonight we were successful but regretted it afterwards.   We ordered two bourbon and their homemade citrus soda that were the bomb!!  We sat down at our table after about a 20 min wait which wasn't bad. Our server Craig seemed super rushed right from the start, which is just annoying. We were a little limited to what we could eat because we don't eat cheese but we started with the chicken pot pie.  Which was good but it really could have been fabulous. There just wasn't enough veggies.   I ordered the lamb meatballs with spaghetti squash and my bf ordered the special pork ribs with sweet potato fries. We also ordered the brussel sprouts.  This is where it really went wrong.   I get my food and we wait 12 minutes for my boyfriends.  Mine was ice cold by time he got his. We got a sorry but as I said our server seemed rushed when we sat down and it never got better.   As far as flavor my bf's was great except the fries and cornbread were cold. Mine was just ok. I ate half and honestly I wouldn't have eaten it the next day if I had loved it. The flavor was just so so. It needed a little spice.   We ordered the triple chocolate mousse cake and I honestly think Betty Crocker and my old school easy bake oven could have done better. We told the server that we didn't care for it and it wasn't what we expected.   The server did take it off the bill but honestly after the chef screwed up our dinner as badly as he did its the least he could have done.   So yeah we won't be returning",

We originally planned to go to Lo-Lo's but it was closed, so we headed here (as I knew they had Chicken and Waffles) instead. The chicken was over done (just like my Mommy used to make) and the waffle, well it was \"fancy\" (not your normal waffle which is what I had kinda wanted). Don't get me wrong it was okay, just different and came with no syrup, 'cause it was cheese based and that wouldn't work so well.  Our real server was kinda pushed out by another server (thank GOD, as our \"real\" server looked like he had a few years of substance abuse behind him) and our new one was GREAT. We collectively assumed that that this our original servers last night at the place.  That said my girl absolutely loved the food so take my review with a grain of salt. Also it should be duly noted that the place is incredibly hip and beautiful, and drink prices reasonable (two great Four Peaks beers on-tap).  So here's the deal ... go here and ignore this review (sorry I wasted your time). :)  Oh shit! I almost forgot ... the free desert (chocolate cookie dough is the freakin' greatest treat any restaurant has ever given me ... EVER!)",

The tables and chairs are a modge podge of different styles, like it was all purchased from a garage sale and it just happens to all really work together.   There are candles everywhere and on the tables there are small vases with water and sprigs of rosemary.   They have a bar but we do not drink alcohol so we tried their citrus drink and lemonade. Both were delicious and light. I wish we could buy them at the store!  At our waitresses recommendation I had the pork loin with spinach and fennel with a spicy cream sauce. There was a pear and mango sort of salsa on the pork which was very good!  My husband had the waffles and chicken. The waffle is where Tuck Shop lost a star for us. The waffle came out burned, like parts of it were black. There was only one other couple dining there so it isn't like the kitchen was rushed and they could not have possibly missed that it was burned, like I said, parts of it were black.   My husband raved about the fried chicken. I had a taste and it was cooked perfectly. The coating was spicy and crunchy but very thin (thin in a good way - like not a bunch of flour gooped on and fried sort of way) He is one of the pickiest eaters I have ever known and he really enjoyed his meal too.   We shared a piece of chocolate cake with flan. I wasn't a huge fan but if you are into flan it probably would have been a winner. My husband enjoyed the bottom cake part of it.   The cookie dough balls at the end were a treat. I wish we could have ordered a little box of those yummies to go!   Our waitress was darling and attentive and I am glad we ventured into Phoenix to check out Tuck Shop. It was a treat!",

    "text": "I had been wanting to go to the Tuck Shop since they opened, but kept putting it off. We went with a group of six and started off with a few appetizers, The Chorizo stuffed dates were awesome as well as the Cheese Sticks. The Mac and Cheese was to die for. We had the Skirt Steak, Fried Chicken with Waffles as well as a special Pasta dish. We also had a couple of bottles of wine and a few cocktails. It really is the kind of place to share and try a variety of dishes. Even give a try things that you would not normally order because they are prepared in such a different way that you may be surprised to find a new favorite. The manager John is a good fit for this space. He is very friendly and a cutie too.  The prices are very reasonable with most of the dishes under $10 and none over $18. I found the portions very fair for the quality and the price. We were all so stuffed that we did not even order desert and even took a doggie bag home. It is such a treat to have a restaurant of this caliber in the CORONADO neighborhood. It may not be for everyone, but some people don't expect a playground to come with their restaurants.  Give it a try and thank me later.",

We ordered Fontina sticks that were different, but very good. We then at the stuffed dates. In a similar fashion, they were a little outside my traditional palette, but were very good. We finished by sharing the pork T-bone. The T-bone was probably the least inventive of the 3 dishes, but was nonetheless very tasty. I felt the whole meal was a little pricey for what was given, but the food was good. We decided to go somewhere else for dessert since it was early, but several of the options did sound appealing.",

    "text": "The fundamentals that produce great food in a restaurant will result in loyal customers that will go anywhere to enjoy it.  Here is a perfect example of just that.  Tuck Shop is nestled in the historic Cornado district and is surrounded by homes. No major cross roads, no traffic that can see it.  Yet when you do find this place and notice the details in the entry way followed by the modern decor you know you are somewhere different.    The restaurant seats maybe 60 people and has a great cocktail lounge to relax before you get seated for what is to come. Feel like reading, or playing a game just look at the neighboring shelf and you might just find it.  For drinks start off with some good craft beer or have some of their cocktails which they have several mixes that are awesome.  We started the evening off with the Baguette, my wife is a big garlic nut so we couldn't resist.  Next came Brussels Sprouts that to be honest are not something I eat regularly but here, bring it all day.   For dinner I cheat and order for two but why not this place is worth it! For starters the Mac and Cheese is AMAZING!  They even give it somewhat toasty flare with the proscuitto, sizzling!  YUM  Next we finish off with an order of Lamb Meatballs and my wife orders her favorite Chicken and Waffles which btw I will not say this too loud but probably are the best in town.  Desert? If you have room get a illy espresso and their desert bite that can vary depending on the day, me thinks.  Enjoy and believe me this place is it.",

The dim lighting and chill music was the perfect setting for an end of the week dinner. We had to wait for about 30 minutes for a table to open up, but in the meantime the lovely bartender made an aw-wesome margarita, and I am very picky about my margaritas... There's a long table in the middle of the room for a large group, surrounded by several smaller tables. I was actually pleasantly surprised with how nice and comfortable this place was considering it's kind of in an odd location.   We munched on the \"Pasta Fries\" that came with a raspberry jam-like dip and a feta cheese sauce dip. It was all a very weird combination (beer battered pasta, really?) but it was REALLY good. I loved it! I'd totally go back just for the margarita and pasta fries! Mmmm. We ended our food adventure with the mac and cheese with \"lobstah.\" This I didn't like so much. The lobster was too fishy for the mac and cheese, but with out it, it probably would have all been awesome. I needed another margarita after that one  :)",

    "text": "In a word, Tuck Shop is: Awesome.   If you just drove by, surely you'd miss it (I know, I know, I shouldn't call you Shirley). It's tucked away, no pun intended, so you've got to be looking out for it, but you'll thank yourself once you walk in.    It's small and cozy inside, with about 15 tables and a full bar. The decor and ambiance is like a 50s/60s house. The waiting area is cool, it's like a living room...Nice touch. No reservations for parties under six, so if you're in a party of five or fewer, prepare to wait for 20-30 minutes for a table. I was there on a Wednesday at 7pm with a party of four and we waited about 20 minutes. A plus side is that they'll come around and take drink and appetizer orders so you can eat and drink a bit while you wait.  For dinner, I had the chicken and waffles. Um...Amazing. The waffles were savory, with cheddar and some herbs, and the chicken was juicy. My wife had the fish and chips, which she liked but didn't love. Our table also had the Mac and Cheese, Pork Tenderloin, Brussels Sprouts and Cheese Curds. I didn't personally love the Mac and Cheese, but I thought everything else was really good.    Service was attentive, always around if you need something but not hanging around. One of the best things about Tuck Shop is the prices...Our tab top to bottom with 4 entrees, apps and wine was around $110 for the four of us. More than reasonable for the quality of food.   I'll definitely be back.",

Oh so cute inside.... modern 70's style.... great architecture.... love the little living room in the back.  We sat at the bar and ordered a glass of wine and the clam cake appetizer.  They were crunchy on the outside and so flavorful on the inside... and great dipping sauces horseradish and red pepper (we mixed them together!)  I was pretty hungry so I ordered the citrus-brined fried chicken, white cheddar waffles and braised greens. (see pic)  Oh.... heaven!!! so delicious!  I let my friend have a taste of the waffle perfectly crisp and fluffy on the inside.  The chicken looked a little dark, but it couldn't have been better.  I didn't hesitate to lick my fingers!  The greens were bitter so I would definitely see about a substitution for the veggie next time, but we had an awesome experience.",

The atmosphere and service are impeccable. If you are lucky enough not to get sat right away when you visit (no mistake, I said lucky), the waiting area is a little library where the host will bring you drinks. It is a great way to start the evening. The food was good, albeit not amazing, they definitely get their five star rating from atmosphere and service. We went for the first time about a week ago and got cheese curds, a cream of broccoli soup, the chorizo stuffed dates and the chicken and waffles. All were good, worthy of purchase on a future trip, but none of them blew our socks off. I definitely recommend, I just might try something else.",

Great combination of fresh wood paneling on the ceiling and weathered concrete on the floor. I like that everyone here seems to be having a great time. It's comfort food in the neighborhood, and you're invited. Esthetically, it's exactly what I look for in a restaurant: it can be packed but feel like you're the only one there. Perfect. The bar is spacious enough that I'd come even if the food sucked. Luckily, their gin and tonics -- with homemade gin and a cucumber twist -- are absolutely refreshing and just unique enough to warrant some serious excitement.  And the food? Stick-to-your-ribs good. The citrus brined fried chicken is something you have to taste to believe. The kosher salt on the skin (which, by the way, is not gooey and soaked in oil, but crispy like no skin I've had before -- Popeye's, take note!) sticks like a long-lost lover. It's a thing of beauty. And how about the baked garlic and crostini? Simple, yes, but the garlic is tender and not at all overpowering, so you've got a winner there as well.  I'm determined to try many, many more items here. And have many more gin and tonics.",

The ginger ale was not gingery or sweet enough at all for me. The homemade tonic w/ vodka was great though!   Fast forward a few weeks and a date takes me there. Despite me being mostly vegan, they accommodated me pretty well! We ordered the pasta fries which were good but too heavy and unhealthy for me. I got a lovely salad and then the grilled vegetables and hummus, which was awesome! Vegetables were perfectly charred. I stole a bite of my date's waffles from the chicken and waffles he ordered. So, so amazing with a tender crumb.   Dessert was a chocolate lava cake with creme anglaise which was to DIE for. Oh man.....   Service was good but hopefully they will choose to expand their menu a bit more before I return.",
