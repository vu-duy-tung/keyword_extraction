We had an awesome Philly cheese steak and sampled their chicken salad (which was amazing). I can't wait to go back and try more of their food. Extremely friendly and even suggested other great restaurants in the area.",

A girlfriend has been going here for years, was dumbfounded that I had never been, so we bee lined it here. First of all, the owners are from my neck of the woods in PA so insta-love fest. Secondly, warm and welcoming they were so nice to go through the menu and give me samples of the food to help make my decision (which didn't cause everything is so damn good).  I decided on the chicken salad sandwich, TO DIE!!! I MEAN SERIOUSLY!!! It was so damn good.    I love everything about the place. Next time, cheesesteak sandwiches; he's from Philly and they use real meat not the pre packaged stuff. I'm so stoked. Go here, spend the cash (cash only) support local businesses and fall in love. I did.",

    "text": "This was my first time going to this establishment. It came recomended to me by my co-worker who's brother went almost everyday while living here and in high school down the road. I had to go to the costume shop just next door and she told me to look for this place. Thought I would give it a try.  After reading several reviews on Yelp, it helped me to decide this was the place to get my lunch. I walked in and Tina was eager to welcome me and quickly take my order. I mentioned that it was my first time and knew they were a cash only establishment so I wanted to make sure I stayed within the cash that I had on hand.  Got a half Italian with onion and just the way they make it. Nothing extra or added. DELISH!!! The aroma from the oil blended with the herbs were the first thing that I smelt when opening the sandwich. The bread was soft and contents were fresh!  I opted to get a side of potato salad from reading the reviews of it. OMG!!! I don't know that anything can take me away from NOT ordering that every time I come back. The potatoes are cut almost like an au gratin type cut which makes it so nice and filling (even with the small cup that you are served). It was creamy and the blend of sweet and tart made it just a wonderful delight!! Who doesn't love a good potato salad!  Next I got a cannolli. Being born on Long Island, New York and going back to visit family, that every time you go you have to visit the bakery to get fresh cannollies to bring them home to the parents back in Arizona. THIS CANNOLLI WAS EVERYTHING THE REVIEWS SAID THEY WERE. The cream was just sweet enough filled all the way though the shell (the way it should be!!!) and creamy as can be. PERFECTION!!! I just found my new place to get my parents their craving for New York style cannollies!  When I get the craving for a sandwich, I'll be putting this place on the map of go to places first!! To get all that I did on just over $7.00 for lunch it was perfect!  My co-worker is now planning on visiting for dinner for her and her husband tomorrow night on her way home!",

The food is great, but the people running the place is first class, checking on you throughout the meal and engaging in conversation. Most of the food review has been hit already, but the chicken salad, Italian and pastrami were huge hits in our group.  Couple of tips: - Cash only! - If you're coming during a holiday weekend, be sure to call! We lucked out coming Friday before the Memorial Day weekend, but they're closed for the rest of the long weekend. - Try the cannoli. They fill as you order it (like you're supposed to) so it's not soggy like a lot of other places.",

I know this because it's been around almost as long as I have been and I grew up in the neighborhood. The Valley National Bank next door is long gone and the strip center has remodeled, but the deli is in the same spot. I have memories of being sent on my bike with a few bucks by my mom to pick up some subs for the family when she didn't want to cook. So how does it stack up today? Our family came back for lunch.   It has not changed much over the years. The same 1970s paneling is on the walls, and the Saguaro senior class photos still dominate the decor.   The primary difference between the sausage sub I ate in my youth to the one I had yesterday is the bread today is better: a solid crunch on the roll while still light inside. My wife's chicken steak was tasty, and the marinara is awesome. I didn't get to try a bit of my parents' cold subs but they finished them both happily.   Everyone behind the counter that I saw was a family member (again, I grew up in the neighborhood: if you went to Mohave & Saguaro in the 70s & 80's or you went to St. Maria's you knew or knew of the Casella's) and this means they will close for summer vacation in July and close during the Christmas holidays to take a break. And yes, it's still cash only. But coming here for lunch felt like coming home. I may live in Texas now, but my heart will always be in this part of Scottsdale.",

    "text": "Came to Casella's to meet with a friend, both first timers. Immediately when I waked in I was welcomed, and thankfully a table was available right away.  Reviewed the menu for a few minutes, and was asked by \"Chris\" if I had any questions. Went over a few and she was so helpful. Explained I was waiting for a friend, and was willing to take my order ahead of time and not prepare it until my friend arrived. I also explained I wanted a separate order to go, no problem!  I ordered the Philly cheese w/peppers and extra peppers on it, with an Italian to go and cannoli. Chris introduced herself, asked me my name and about me. Felt like home here, it was great!!  Shortly after my friend arrived, and he was treated the same way! Once we received or food, our conversation was stopped several times by how authentic everything was!  The bread was toasted perfectly, everything was fresh, hot, and tasted like these were recipes carried over for years by how good it tasted!  Every staple is an Italian sandwich, not mention the cannoli. I saved these for later. (Best for last!). I couldn't wait and had to try the cannoli while driving home for the day..IT WAS SO GOOD! I've had a few cannoli's, but this one was the topper!!! I can't even explain how good it was, you just have to go get one and try for yourself!!  Couple notes to make, this place can get packed very quickly. So try to get a table as soon as possible. No cards accepted, only cash.  In all, I paid for my friend and I's lunch which cost a total of $25. That included 3 sandwiches, 2 bags of chips, and a cannoli. Very good deal for what we got.  A must go to for anyone that wants to add another family owned, authentic Italian place to eat!!",

They have a limited menu on Sunday's (no steak sandwiches) but most of the menu is still available.   We decided for the meatball sub and the pizza hoagie, both of which were delicious.   The atmosphere is definitely retro (70s) but in a good way. Cash only. You don't see many places like this in Scottsdale anymore. They really care about the customer and want to make you the best sandwich you have ever eaten.   I will definitely be back in.",

The chicken salad sandwich. This is my favorite!!!!! Omg its so good! Freaking delicious.   Pasta salad. Great side order for your sandwich. Very tasty.   Biggest problem with the place (and the reason I don't give it 5 stars) is that they only accept cash. Come on, what kind of place doesn't take credit cards these days? First time there I didn't have any on me & i had to drive all the way back home & come back since I already put my order in. Annoying.   But give it a try some time. Very homey feeling too.

Found Casella's through Yelp, while looking for a sandwich in the Scottsdale area.   Plus: The meat, cheese, white roll, and mayo were very good on my cold Ham sandwich.  Plus: Locally owned/operated (not a chain). The woman that took the order was nice and helpful.  Plus: $6.10 for a full sandwich. Reasonably priced, especially for the size.   Plus: They sell Yoo-Hoo, which quenches your thirst!  Plus: The senior class panoramic photos of Saguaro High School almost made me wish I was a Sabercat too.  Negative: The menu isn't on Yelp, and it should be! A picture of the menu is on urbanspoon.  Neutral: The decor of Casella's reminds me of Sam's butcher shop on the Brady Bunch, but  without the butcher counter. Very 1970s.  Neutral: Should highlight the \"half sandwich\" more. The full is pretty large, and if I'd seen the half on the menu, I would have ordered it.  Neutral: Don't take credit cards, but most of the Yelp reviews say this, so it shouldn't be a surprise.  When I'm in the area again, I'll try the cheesesteak Marina. Sounds interesting.",

They care about you -- the customer. The whole Casella family is amazing (they run the joint).  Food: Their food is insane.  What I recommend:  Chicken Salad - I get this on the wheat roll with tomato and lettuce  Italian - leave it the way it comes on a white roll. It has some provolone, two meats, tomatoes, lettuce, oil/vinegar dressing, and some oregano -- trust me - leave it alone!  Steak w/ the works - so when I first heard of this \"steak with the works\" -- I was like \"Are you serious? Why the hell would I want to put your delicious home made marinara sauce on a cheese steak? That's poppycock!\"  (rant/tangent) Listen to them. They know what they're talking about. You want a freaking cheese steak in Arizona? Well get it from someone that lived in Philly and decided to grace us with his presence back 33 years ago and say \"HEY -- This! Is a cheese steak.\" (angels ahhh ahhh ahhhhh ahhhh). Which reminds me - they've been in the same neighborhood spot for over 33 years. Family owned.  Anyways, so cheese steak, I would get extra cheese, because well, I love cheese. You can order this to go and eat it at home, but I would rather eat it in the car, then let this baby depreciate. It is so damn good. GET IT  So they also have sides, pasta salad, bomb, fresh made lemon aid and iced tea (Arnold Palmer people!)  Cannolis - o wow - freshly piped - insane - delicious things  Pizzelles -- made fresh by a lovely lady that you'll usually find behind the counter! Chocolate, Regular flavor, I believe lemon. Bomb -- wow oh wow!  Bread: white or wheat roll - baked fresh by a local bakery  I have coined the term: \"So good, it's worth the drive\"  I haven't been here in about two months, I've been quite busy, but am going to make it this Saturday for the people I manage. Free lunch for the bunch! (I'm paying)  There is only one Casellas -- you must go here. You must try it. If you don't like it -- email me and I will refund you. I will also call you a moron in the process.  Oh and prices, jesus is it cheap!  menu can be found: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.urbanspoon.com%2Fr%2F22%2F260796%2Frestaurant%2FPhoenix%2FCasellas-Italian-Delicatessen-Scottsdale&s=467bed966976b57ab9688426e92dec6435903a02231966b4cd510d5822e2860c\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">urbanspoon.com/r/22/2607...</a>",

The menu at DeFalco's for example is much broader, and they have larger portions. I had the Italian sandwich and it was good as well.  As several have noted, this place looks like someone kept the dust covers on everything for 30 years and then decided to reopen it again. There is a lot more potential for this place, but they seem to be sticking to what has worked for the past 30+ years. While nostalgic it also seems a little lazy.   Bottom line is eat here.",

The owner came and sat with us a bit to make sure our sammies were to our liking and to tell us the history of his family business. I had the cheesesteak, my fellow diner had the meatball sub and both were solid. Also, ordered some chicken salad to go. They apparently sell 150 pounds a month of the stuff and after one bite you'll know why. It's classic and good! Yes the place looks like it hasn't been updated since it opened in 1977 but it all adds to the character. My only wish is that they would have a few tables outside.",

    "text": "Once upon a long, long time ago life seemed simpler. Neighborhoods were more stable, everybody knew everybody. When you went into a store, the shopkeeper called you by name and probably knew what you were planning to buy. For better or worse (and it certainly wasn't all good) those times are long gone - but we found a little slice of it last Friday.       When we walked into Casella's Italian Sub Shop at about 3PM, we were warmly greeted by Joe and Denise, a father/daughter team. Joe, originally from Philadelphia, opened the restaurant thirty-three years ago in this exact spot in a strip mall on Granite Reef, just south of McDonald in Scottsdale. Denise started working with him twenty some years ago. They instantly know if you're part of the \"family\" or a newbie. If you're curious about an item on the menu, you're given a taste. Most of the things are made in house. Joe cooks 70 pounds of chicken breast a week for his famous chicken salad. Mom makes the meatballs, and Denise the cannoli filling. I could go on, but you get the idea. These are genuinely nice people who care about their product and want to please the customer. Joe gets in every morning at 7:30 (although service doesn't start until  11 AM) and stays right through closing at 6 PM. He likes to know what's going on. Saturday closing is at 3 PM so everybody can spend time with their families. And there's a lengthy Christmas break for the same reason. Very nice.       Naturally, Philadelphia Steak Sandwiches ($6.60 - $7.20) appear on the menu. Joe's isn't your typical greasy, cheese whiz loaded, meat too-tough-to-chew sandwich (which, I admit, often appeals to me): here the meat is meltingly tender, sauced with a little marinara, and topped with provolone, served on an outstanding roll made by a local family baker.       We had to try the chicken salad sandwich ($3.70 fir a half, $7.20 full size) - we knew it would be fresh since Joe cooks up a batch most mornings. In the back cooler you can see huge jars of mayonnaise waiting their turn. The salad was very simple, not gussied up with lots of add-ins. I will say that when I ate the leftovers at home I added a dollop of cranberry sauce. I think I'll bring some to Casella's next time we go.       After 2 PM, if you buy two sandwiches, you get a third free. So I chose the Italian Hoagie ($3.70/$6.80). Ken was astonished to find that he actually enjoyed this one. What made it truly delicious, oddly enough, were the onions. Thinly sliced, and sweet enough to be eaten on their own, they also graced the cheese steak. Our side of homemade coleslaw was one of the best versions in town. Can't wait to try the potato and pasta salads.        Other sandwices on the menu include roast beef, ham and cheese, meatball, sausage, and pastrami (not made in-house). Also available are two entrees: Lasagna ($10) and Spaghetti & Meatballs ($8).        Now for dessert. Ken wanted a cannoli, usually not something I like. I'm now a convert, at least to Casella's version. Denise makes the silky filling, garnished only with a few chocolate chips, and the large, wonderfully crispy shells don't get filled until you're ready to snarf one down. Homemade rice pudding is on the menu. We had a taste and it, too, was delicious, but it had no raisins. We'll bring those next time, along with the cranberry sauce.       Not much to say about the decor. I think it came from that long, long ago time. Basic wood paneling. There are photographs of years and years of Saguaro High (I think that's the school) graduating classes. That's about it. But the warmth of the Casella's fills the room.",

    "text": "Tried this place out for the first time, and I believe they have a returning customer.  At first glance, you would likely overlook this hidden gem.  It is tucked away in the back of strip mall.  The interior looks like it is from the 70's with hardwood paneling.  However, don't let this fool you.  It has been owned and operated by the same family for over 30 years.  It is very cheap and is a great deli.  The chicken salad club is awesome.  Definitely try this if it is your first time.  The Italian sub was also good.  The bread is what makes these sandwiches so great.  The Philly sub also looked great, and I will return for that.    The service was spectacular and they treat you like you are an old friend.  Every member of the family chips in, and they go out of their way to make sure you enjoy your meal.  This is so rare in today's society.  If you buy 2 during the week you get 1 free as well...awesome deal!",

    "text": "Lots of regulars here, and it's understandable. The woman at the counter was greeting everyone by name, shaking hands with them, and seemed to know personal details about many of them. A feeling of genuine kindness and wanting to be of service prevails here. I'm guessing if it wasn't for the counter in the way I would have seen hugs exchanged. The look of the place is dated and nothing special, but the customer service makes the atmosphere a standout.        Prices are reasonable (cash only), even by fast-food standards. Under $7 for a sandwich, the most expensive item on the menu is the $10 lasagna dinner (I'm betting it's a bargain). They don't do fancy. It's simple food done well. Quality, fresh ingredients. I had the pastrami sandwich and a cannoli for dessert. Great stuff!       A family run shop that makes you feel like you are in your grandma's kitchen while you are there. Absolutely love it!",

    "text": "I nearly missed my flight for these sandwiches and it was totally worth the stress! I was in from CA to catch a couple Giants games and had an hour to spare before getting to the airport. I had seen this place on Yelp and thought I'd get a sandwich for the flight back.  Denise and Joe were the nicest, most genuine folks. They exuded warmth and pride of ownership and it certainly shows in their food. The roast beef was awesome, and Joe offered me some straight from the slicer while I was waiting. Denise offered me a taste of the homemade chicken salad which was delicious indeed. I would have loved to try the hot sandwiches, especially the meatball, but that will have to wait until next time as I needed cold options for the flight.   I couldn't resist the buy 2 get 1 free so I made it 2 roast beefs and an italian. I ate 1 before I reached airport and the other roast beef that night! The italian was my lunch the next day--very tasty, too.   The food was excellent but the customer service confirmed a legitimate 5 star rating. I will return whenever I visit Phoenix!",

    "text": "I was inspired to visit Casella's after a coworker told me about their authentically Italian goodness. As my tummy growled today, I was in the neighborhood so I knew just where to go. I walked into a simple yet clean deli. Immediately, I was welcomed by the entire staff (I believe they are all related or at least family through friendship). They asked me if it was my first time in and I said yes, so right away they started giving me a history of the shop and the tasty cuisine. Celebrating their 33rd anniversary (congrats!!), I learned that everything is homemade -- from the meatballs to the chicken salad. The owner said he goes through 40 lbs of chicken a week. He gave me a sample and the chicken was chunky and delicious. I'm not surprised he has to prepare so much chicken every week! The meatballs and freshly cut meat for Philly Cheese-steak sandwiches looked great too! The owner mentioned he is from Philly so better be ready for some authentic Philly and Italian style cookin'!   While I was there, the owner was slicing some fresh provolone, so I added that to the warmed turkey sandwich I ordered. The turkey was tasty, the provolone was yummy and the sourdough roll tasted like it was fresh from the oven. It was $8 for a sandwich and soda but the sandwich was hefty enough that I saved half for later. As I walked out, everyone said goodbye to me and I felt like I was leaving a family dinner.   In summary, here's what made Casella's stand out:   - The very friendly staff - It's a local family-owned neighborhood deli celebrating their 33rd anniversary. Gotta support the local businesses!  - Clean decor  - Tasty, homemade food that's on display for visitors to see  - A good family-style atmosphere that greets you the second you walk inside.   I'm not sure how it's taken my so long to find this local treat, but now that I've found it, I plan on becoming a regular.   Directions: Note that this is hidden in the Basha's strip mall (on the side of Granite Reef) but don't let that fool you!",

I had heard very good things about this deli, so when i finally got bored of the same ole lunch I bring to work every day it was time to get in on this following.  I had the italian sub on wheat bread.  Um, talk about Freshness!  I'm pretty sure I ate the whole thing in like 3 minutes because I just couldn't get enough.  The bread was so soft, the meat was outstanding, and the provolone was real!  Alll it had was oil and vinegar on it with lettuce tomato and the typical italian meats.  I normally cannot eat a sandwhich without mayo and mustard, specially some spicy brown.  That was wonderful, but now after reading these reviews, it's time for me to check out that Chicken Salad, I love chicken salad.",

I lived in this town 30 years and snooped and supped, looking for the perfect Philly Cheese steak and this is it. I just happened upon the place, walked in and BAM, Joe was on me like a bird on a junebug. Pumpin' my hand, meetin' and greetin'.. 20 minutes and it like old home week. $6.80 for the real deal, full blown sandwich. Steak Cheese with pepper and onions... I had the potato salad and a dill pickle the size of your head. My wife had the Pastrami with cheese and onions, heated. She's no heavy eater so half had to come home in a bag, but she thought it to be mighty tasty as well. Wow. I'm a goner. Thought Defalco's was good but since Greasy Tony's is no more this is tops in my book. It's a deli, so no valet parking!! It's cash only and that's okay by me 'cause it ain't pricey. They been in the same plkace 37 years and it's the first time I ever heard of the place. Shame on me and the Arizona Republic... The sauce is super... I didn't have the meatball sandwich, only because I was on a steak cheese mission, but that will be next. It will have to wait a while 'cause I feel like a Boa that ate a small pig. The place is hid out off McDonald Rd. , then south at Granite Reef, then it's just on the left by the Bashas'. It's all about the meat, the bread, the folks!!! I'll stop now or you'll think I'm a shill. Did I mention the chicken salad? Oooh yeah I did.... Enough",

I had the Philly Cheese Steak with peppers at the owners suggestion and we also ordered a roast beef sandwich.  Both were very good. High quality and flavors.  The cheese steak tasted like one from a small Italian run place in south Philly. I tried the slaw and chicken salad. The slaw was nicely balanced. The chicken salad will make anyone who wants a mayoe salad with subtle seasonings.  By the way. I am in that camp. I love a vinegary salad a lot but there is something comforting in a chicken salad that makes me think of my mom.  Go here enjoy the food.",

If you are in the area, stop by, nothing fancy to expect from the building itself but the food is what Lunch dreams are made of. Closed on Sundays and they deserve it...great sandwich/deli.

We couldn't help ourselves, and on the way out we just had to get a couple of the fresh-baked chocolate chip cookies made from grandma's original recipe. For a real treat, ask to see if Joe is around. If he isn't too busy in the back making chicken salad (he makes 40 lbs of it every other day) or fresh sausage, he will gladly come out and chat with you.   This deli is worth the drive from anywhere in the Valley. It is definitely worth a visit. One trip and you will want to come back again and again. I know I do, and I know a lot of people have. Plenty of regulars came in while we were there. I know this because each one was greeted with their first name as they came in and were all asked how their family was doing. Become the newest member of the Casella family and stop on by!  PS: Cash only, no credit cards accepted.",

The owner Joe brought us all a taste of the chicken salad. We all decided that we would return the next day to get chicken salad to go. Much to our disappointment they are closed on Sunday. If you are ever close stop and eat. They are friendly and the food is awesome.",

    "text": "Casella's is a wonderful neighborhood deli, run by a family that's been in business in the same spot for 38 years! It's where the locals go, and it seems they go often and know everybody else there. Good vibes come from every direction at Casella's!   When you go, here's a special tip: Order the pizza hoagie with added meatballs, which were cut up into small pieces throughout the sandwich. I have had a lot of hoagies in a lot of places, but I've had none better than this one. In fact, I'd venture to say it's the very best.   My wife had the Italian hoagie, which I tasted and also found delicious. We spoke with Mr. Casella, who with his wife founded the place.   For dessert we had a package of Denise's chocolate chip cookies. Get some!   We live about a 10-minute drive from Casella's, and we plan to return there many times in the future for genuinely authentic happy meals.  :-)",

    "text": "This was the first stop for lunch upon arriving in Scottsdale from Toronto.  I wasn't blown away but I will agree with other yelpers that the staff was very friendly and they seemed to know everyone who came in.   I'll start with the positives:  - very inexpensive...the hot Italian beef with jus was only 7 bucks!  - also got a half chicken salad sandwich (nice to be able to order half sizes for the cold sandwiches (note you can't do that with the hot sandwiches though) - the cannoli was delicious! - very friendly place that seemed to bring a lot of locals  The not so great if I am being picky - I really don't like when the person handling the money touches the food. After I paid (cash only by the way) she took the sandwich and cut it in half and arranged it in the basket for us without gloves or washing hands first - sandwiches were just ok, but commensurate with the price so I am not complaining.  All in all a cute joint and friendly but I likely would not be back.",

The roast beef, the chicken salad, and the cheese steak with sauce and onions were my favorites, but it's all good.   Since then, I've lived in Tucson, Flagstaff, Seattle and Honolulu and I've yet to find a sandwich place anywhere close to as good as Cassellas. I had chicken salad sandwiches flown out to Seattle 10 years ago, and visited the deli myself 5 years ago, and nothing had changed, it was as good as I remembered and just as inexpensive.   Those of you local to the area, enjoy it, cuz you ain't gonna find a replacement very easily anywhere else.",

They are responsible for what they put in their customers' bodies.    Now onto the food...if you can only stop for one thing, you have to buy the potato and chicken salad.  Both of these sides are homemade and delicious!    The steak sandwiches would make Philadelphia proud, I recommend the works sandwich myself.    God Bless Joe, Tina and family!!  -Kris Dornan",

Would have enjoyed a little more Oil in it.  The ingredients tasted fresh and it was a solid Sandwich.....not the best I ever had, but pretty good.  Will have to come back to try some of their other stuff.  They're not open on Sundays, so I'll have to try and squeeze in a visit during the week.  Return Factor - 85%",

There is something to be said about good food and a friendly atmosphere that stands the test of time.  It is easy to see why this family-run business has been open for 34 years and counting.  Since first discovering this local gem with my Favorite Yelper a few months ago, I have lost count of the number of visits we have made.  Each and every time, we are greeted like family.  Denise even remembers our order!  Well, to be honest, every customer is greeted like family.  That is one of the many reasons we can't stay away.  The decor is unpretentious, and the wood-paneled, nostalgia-filled walls tell the story of years of being a staple in the community.  Don't be surprised if you are offered a taste of whatever is being sliced behind the counter - thank you again Joe, for that Provolone!  :)  Ready to taste a little bit of heaven?  Order the Hot Italian Beef with Provolone.  Served on a soft yet slightly crisp roll with a side of Au Jus, I struggle to find words to describe how good this sandwich is.  Just try it.  You won't be sorry.    Maybe money can't buy you love, but it can get you a fantastic meal - Casella's is cash-only.  I have decided that I want to be adopted by the Casella family.  Sorry mom, but if you ever taste one of Casella's sandwiches, you will understand...",

    "text": "Eating at Casella's is like coming home to a home-cooked meal - if you live in Philly and have great cooks in your family.  No wonder they just celebrated 40 years in business. People: The Casella family is so unbelievably nice! I met Dad and the two daughters who were working that day. They are friendly and welcoming to everyone; he even came and sat at my table to chat. 5 stars for the owners. Food: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FOh.my&s=98edab0cb2c458afb9b59a25bbadcf0054149a3363212accbb9e496ac87121c5\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Oh.my</a>.word! I ordered a beef sandwich with peppers and onions. They showed me the paper-thin beef before they cooked it to perfection and served it on a beautifully soft white roll. My mouth was full of deliciousness. They also offered samples from their selection. The coleslaw was not too sweet and not overdressed, so very good. The chicken salad sample had a bit too much creaminess for my liking, but was still flavorful. They make everything from scratch (except the pickles) and I look forward to trying more offerings. 5 stars for the sandwich alone. Ambience: This is a no-frills environment, but it's light and clean and full of lovely people. One wall is covered with pictures of the graduating classes of Saguaro High School since the 80s - because that's where all 4 daughters attended - so 5 stars for hometown appeal. I simply can't wait to go visit again and say \"Hi!\" to my new family.",

    "text": "Casella's is an iconic family-run sandwich shop in Scottsdale - Joe, his wife, and daughters have been running the place for decades.   Just don't expect a typical \"deli\" - because it's not a deli, it's a sandwich shop. Reading the other reviews, this seems to confuse people who are expecting a wide array of meats sliced in front of them etc...That's not what happens here, the operation is much more simple than that, so curb your \"NY deli\" expectations...   The interior is a throwback to the 70's, nothing has changed at all with the decor. To be honest its a bit dingy and worn, but that is also part of the charm. If you ever get to chat with Joe, you realize that Casella's is like a classic East coast joint.  Home of the original Arizona pizza steak! If you ask Joe, or just listen (he likes to tell the story), he'll tell you he brought the pizza steak to Arizona from Philadelphia. And it was worth the journey - it's really really good.  They are also very famous for their chicken salad, and I don't know what it is about it - but it's also really really good.  I like their bread, it's a nice soft french-style hoagie roll - and you just can't go wrong with any of their sandwiches though the pizza steak and chicken salad are my two absolute favourites.   Aside from the hot & cold sandwiches, Cassella's also serves Italian dinners - spaghetti, meatballs, sausage etc..., and several sides like baked beans, and my personal favourite - \"the health salad\".  The health salad is amazing. I get at least a pint of it every time. Its basically chopped celery, bell peppers, carrots etc in a sweet vinaigrette. Very basic stuff and tastes just like the Hungarian side salads I used to eat as a kid, and just like back then, I always drink \"the juice\" that is leftover when the salad is gone.  A total 70's-style dive joint that serves the best pizza steak and chicken salad subs in the valley, with a smile.  It's no surprise you'll always find the place packed with families and kids, and Joe greeting everyone with a story.   NOTE: Casella's is CASH ONLY and closes at 6pm.",

Food was great, and the counter person, a daughter of the owners, was very helpful and friendly. I had an Italian Beef Sandwich, and being from Chicago where the Beef Sandwich is king, I enjoyed it a lot.  It's busy as hell at lunch time, but the family crew moved like a well-oiled machine to get everyone their food in a very reasonable amount of time.  My one, and only real con. Cash only. It's time to step up to modern retailing and accept credit cards. Luckily, I had cash when I went in, but I saw customers walk out because they weren't carrying enough to cover their purchase.  Definitely, check it out, and bring cash.",

Both were awesome.  I also love their salads.  I had the pasta and chicken salad.  The chicken salad receives my only small complaint, because it is a little too thick for my taste.  Maybe they need to ease up on the mayonnaise or something.  I don't know.  This place gets extremely busy around lunch time, but the service is quick.  Try to remember that they do not take debit / credit cards or checks.  Cash is king.  The Casella family is like a well-oiled machine: dad runs around, making sure everything is orderly and clean, while mom and the daughters handle cooking, food prep, and the front counter.  I simply love this place....even more than DeFalco's.",

Most importantly it is part of the fabric within the community. It is still owned and operated by the same family. The Husband & Wife along with their daughters work this well oiled machine to provide good quality and great tasting food to all those that walk thru the door. Everyone is treated like family weather your a 1st timer or a repeat customer like myself. I have eaten a many of cheesesteaks in what is the \"Capital\" of cheesesteaks. None and I have eaten @ all of them, make you feel welcomed as family. The food here is very good. I recommend everything! They do only take CASH! It is a no frills place that offers a good quality meal at affordable prices. You will not walk anyway hungry. It is nice to see a mom and pop place like this stand the test of time with all the crappy fast food chains near by. They have done this by making sure they serve a top quality product to all. Go enjoy a great tasting sandwich while experiencing some living history.",

    "text": "I'm not sure how to write this review without telling a story. I normally don't write dissertations, favoring the short and sweet condensed review, so if it's a little verbose, bear with me as it's a story worth reading.  We've heard about Casella's for years but have never eaten there, usually due to bad timing on our part as they close early on Saturday and are not open for business on Sundays.  We finally made it there today during normal business hours.  Not knowing what to expect, we decided prior to going in if we weren't impressed with the menu, or the joint itself, we'd give each other the signal and find another lunch place. Well we weren't impressed with the decor, the menu or the overall ambiance, so we gave each other the nod and started for the door.  That's when the owner, Joe Casella stopped us. Recognizing us as newbies, he told us all about his restaurant,  the menu, and even offered us a taste of whatever we liked. We declined, perhaps being a bit skeptical. But then something interesting happened.  Joe introduced us to his wife and two of his four daughters (who were on duty) and we were instantly enamored with this family.  Who does that in 2011? Seriously. He asked our names and even shook my hand.  Long story short, after talking with Joe for just a few short minutes, my wife and I gave each other a reverse nod, signaling our eagerness to try something...anything!  We ordered a couple sandwiches on Joe's recommendation. The food was superb. The bread was one of the best rolls I've ever had and is enough reason by itself  to keep us coming back. Crusty and not overly breaded, it reminded me of the rolls in Atlantic City where the bread is pure perfection.  Same for the sandwich ingredients, full of flavor and cooked just right.  But the best part was how Joe came over to talk to us after finishing our meal. He wanted our candid opinion of the food and service. If there's any single reason for me to frequent this place, it's the genuine heartfelt sincerity of the owner and his family, not to mention the food!  Sure, the decor is old and needs updating, but somehow, after meeting the family, and eating lunch, I didn't care about the decor, or the no-nonsense menu, or the layout. None of that mattered anymore.  What mattered was the overall experience of a True family restaurant, their wholesome foods, and being in the company of genuinely warm people.   In a time when most of us tend to rely on first impressions, judging the proverbial book by its cover almost caused us to miss out on the Casella's experience had it not been for Joe Casella taking our hand and welcoming us into his unique domain.  Casella's took me back in time today, when my grandparents would often take me with them to the Italian deli for lunch.  As they visited with the owner (in Italian), sipped espresso for what seemed like hours, and ate a slow lunch, I wanted to die. I remember sitting there in the booth fidgeting as they talked, hoping like hell we'd get out of there soon. I hated that experience as a kid. I loved it today as an adult, but more importantly, finally recognized and appreciated the gift my grandparents unknowingly gave me.  Thank-You Joe",

Tina, Joe and their lovely family couldn't be more welcoming and inviting.  They are so sweet!  We were visiting from Los Angeles and they made us feel like family.  Everything is homemade -the sauces, the meatballs, the bread, the rice pudding and cannolis. Absolutely delicious!  Our dogs report that the homemade dog biscuits are great! Highly recommend this Italian oasis in the desert.  Our next trip to Scottsdale definitely includes visiting Casella's - multiple times.",

I was handed a taste of their special chicken salad and I will never eat chicken salad anywhere else!

Canollis are hand made to order so they arent soggy. Gotta try it! Oh, cash only by the way. There is a Basha's in the center if you need to go grab a pack of gum to get cash back!

We both opted for the Italian Sub with two large drinks, which came to around $17.  I would say the sandwiches were about 10inches long and they came with no accompanying side dishes.  The meats on the sub were good with the perfect amount of dressing so the bread didn't get all mushy.  And the drinks came with free refills.  You can tell the place has been around for a very long time and the people who work there are very nice.  I thought the food was decent, but I lived in Europe and and an Italian neighborhood in NYC, so my expectations are very high when it comes to Italian delis.",

From all the reviews I tried a half chicken salad and a half hoagie.  The chicken salad was chicken, celery, and mayo. They bobbed it on a decent french roll. No lettuce, no tomato, no pickles or peppers of any kind.  The \"Italian Hoagie\" was also on a decent french roll and contained 3 slices of salami, a slice of boiled colorless ham, a slice of cheese you could see through, a little shredded lettuce, 2 thin half slices of tomato, and a small amount of dressing that was hard to find. Nothing else.  The prices are inexpensive, but it's no wonder. Italian Deli?  I don't  think so.  Makes me think all the reviews are phony.",

This is family owned, so you always get greeted with a smile and a hello. Quick service. The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is because they only take cash, they close at 3 and are closed on Sundays and for weeks in the summer, which for me is a little troublesome..But I gaurantee the food makes up for it!!",

Everyone on Yelp recommended the Philly Cheese steak. It definitely wasn't anything special, the meat was a little dry, the bread wasn't authentic cheese steak break but rather what you would find on any sub. I haven't had a cheese steak I like that uses provolone instead of whiz. The one awesome thing that came out of the experience was their homemade dog biscuits. My dog loved them and they were made of all natural ingredients.",

    "text": "Decided that no Philly steak should be cross-pollinated with red sauce, it just doesn't work well. The bread is soft and the meat is fresh, but this sandwich just is very average and just not that tasty enough for another visit in two years. First off, the setup is wrong - you should be walking past all the food in the tray's before you ever get to the register, otherwise how the hell do you know what they are serving? I suspect since the place is 40 years old, the setup doesn't matter due to all the regular's who support mom and pop stuff. Hey, if a chain is better, then that's where I'm going, no loyalty for me. Prices are also up a dollar as my last menu this sandwich was $7.20 and now we are at $8.20 and you still can't use your debit card. Cash Only only benefits the employer and too me indicates cheap owners who don't care about customers.",

But boy, their authentic Italian subs are just TO DIE FOR. You can tell that they have a TON of loyal followers because they were hugging every other customer that walked in the door and knew almost everyone by name. That just makes my heart sing!  As I mentioned above, it is cash only so make sure you have dolla bills in your pocket!! ;)   You can order two different halves of the cold sandwiches which literally made my day because I could not choose! They all looked so yummy. I ordered 1/2 chicken salad and 1/2 Italian both on an AMAZING soft hoagie roll that they get delivered daily. I honestly don't know which one I liked best because they were so fantastic. The owner said that he makes 40lbs of chicken every other day, totaling about 160lbs of chicken a week JUST for their famous chicken salad. WOWZA! Their sides also look fantastic and consist of baked beans, potato salad, health salad, coleslaw, chips, pickles, etc.   Of course, you cannot leave without purchasing Denise's famous chocolate chip cookies!   The entire family works here and they are all just the sweetest. Joe, the father, even chased us out to say thank you for coming again! We will 100% be back soon! It is worth the drive.",

As a business owner, paying your fair share of taxes and paying a credit card company a nominal processing fee per transaction are just realities of doing business in 2019. If you can't afford to pay taxes or small card processing fees, then you should close your business down. Obviously this business doesn't care about their customers, because if they did, then they would accept the form of payment that most customers carry in 2019.",

I hope to get another visit in for the Pizza Hoagie before I leave. Sometimes good things never change.  10/22/17. Today I had the Pizza Hoagie before heading back out to Florida.

You walk in and you see a restaurant steeped with history and tradition, with pictures of famous people who are there and the local high school pics. Your mouth immediately begins to water when you smell the terrific aroma of the food. Your heart is warmed when you are immediately greeted by the most friendly and down-to-earth amazing wait staff who were all too willing to give you free samples of their sides. They also told you a little about their family history (41 Years Wow ) and how all of the food is made by momma. Well, let me tell you what...we sampled all the sides and they were not only delicious, they were all unforgettable...the coleslaw was fresh and crunchy with just the right amount of savory seasoning (not too sweet or sour) it will make your palate dance. The winner for me was the potato salad. Creamy, perfectly tender cubed potatoes, a bit of celery, a dash of onion, and a mix of momma's special dressing was so insatiable, you can't stop eating it.   But wait, there's more...the sandwiches. We both had a steak works sandwich. The bread roll was light and delightfully crunchy and filled with fresh steak diced with peppers, light and incredibly well seasoned marinara and onions and folded into the fresh mozzarella that created strings that pulled away from the bread...oh man...I literally am dreaming of going back now. I will definitely only go to Casillas for my sandwiches in the future.",

    "text": "\"\"Family owned and Friendly\"\"  I've eaten here on visits to Scottsdale a couple of times now, and it hasn't disappointed me yet. The only problem I've encountered, is that feeling of being left out. Haha, this place is so friendly, and the clientele so loyal, that nearly everyone in here seems to be on a first name basis! I guess if I want to feel like part of the family, I'll just have to keep coming back. So what to order, well it's primarily an Italian Deli/Sandwich shop, broken down into a selection of Hot sandwiches, and cold sandwiches. I've not been able to move past the Meatball Sandwich yet, perhaps someday I'll try something different, but that's the one that draws me to this place, it's that good.  And for under $8.00 for a fresh, hot, smothered in cheese and fresh marinara, well, it's just pretty hard to top that. The sign on the wall says they have been in Business, owned and operated by the same family for over 40 years. So, my advice, if you've never been to Casella's, well, then you owe it to yourself to try it. What a gem!! Just remember, your going here for the experience, the friendliest service in town, and the homemade flavors, not the decor. haha, wonderful under the cheap eats category. you'll thank me, I promise! Thanks for the memories Joe and Tina, I almost feel like I know you. G",

The restaurant is about to celebrate its 39th anniversary. We got the cold Italian hoagie, health salad and Denise's chocolate chip cookies. The meat in the sandwich was amazing and what a bargain. You can get half a cold sandwich for just $3.90. My only disappointment was that the bread was a little dry. The health salad with marinated peppers, cucumber, carrots and celery was delicious and refreshing. The cookies were delicious and homemade (2 for $1!). Happy to support a great family business!",

I have Italian hoagie, chicken salad, and pepper & cheese steak...not very surprising (I over expect the tastes and Italian flavors).  The Italian hoagie I like the best, it has a lot of olive oil, but the half sandwich is pretty small, about 5\".  The chicken salad is ok, not much different from other deli (I expect to taste something totally different from Italian deli). The pepper & cheese steak is fresh made when u order, the taste is alright, I need to add salt and black pepper to the sandwich to bring up all the flavors..not bad.  Overall, the taste of the sandwich is alright, but it is fresh made, the staffs are super friendly, and I like to support local family owned restaurant, so I would give 4 stars.",

My usual here is the Philly Cheese Steak w Onions.. It's sooo good and pretty damn legit. Some of my coworkers like to get it with sauce. I haven't tried it but they are serious fans of it. Also, the chicken salad sandwich is great. It is made in house and you can definitely tell.   Only two cons (and minor ones) is that they are cash only. I don't get to come here as often because of this. Secondly, they don't have soda by the fountain, only in cans. But no worries, 7-eleven is across the street to solve both of those things. Buy your fountain drink and get cash back and you're set to grab a sandwich here after.",

I truly can't decide what I adore more, the amazing sandwiches, or the warm, friendly family that runs the joint?  Today I took two co-workers to lunch, and when we arrived, we were greeted  so warmly and sincerely, it was like we were family. This is not to be confused with forced corporate niceness that you see at Safeway- this is the real deal.  It gets better. One of my friends didn't think he was hungry, so I ordered a sub, and my other buddy ordered a cheese steak. The employee took or order and invited us to grab a seat.  A short while later, the sweet woman said, \"Hey boys- come and get it.\" When my other friend saw how good the food was, I ordered him a sandwich, and when I went to pay, the woman told me that since it was almost 2:00pm, the sandwich would be free, as they have a buy two, get one after two. I think it was like 1:45, and I thought that was SO cool. Where else does that happen? Let me help you with the answer- nowhere!  You and I both know there are places that won't give you a deal if you are ONE MINUTE early, let alone really early.  On to the food, the sub I got, the Italian cold cut combo, was amazing. Fresh EVERYTHING, great bread, etc. It was simple, delicious and clearly made with pride.  In closing, this place is just a gem, seriously. They are getting ready to celebrate 34 years, and my only regret is just now finding them.  Give Casella's a shot, you will not be disappointed. If you like great food, warm people, and interdependent businesses- this is your place!  Two quick tips:  1. Like many small businesses, they take cash only  2. They are located on the SE corner of Granite Reef and McDonald. Enter from Granite Reef, they are on the South end of the complex.",

I didn't write a review for a long time, because I feel bad since it's a family business, and I do wish them the best of luck.  However, I don't like when businesses have undeserved high ratings.  It's not worth the trip to the ATM beforehand to pay cash only.  If you happen to be at Basha's next door, and are hungry for a sightly better than Subway sub, and have some cash on hand, it's not a bad experience.  If you aren't already in the area, however, it's not worth the extra effort.",

    "text": "This deli is in the Basha's shopping center on the corner of Granite Reef & MacDonalds facing toward Granite Reef.  Went there based on the reviews from yelp and was looking for a good hero with Italian bread.  I will not go back.  The place is very dirty and not at all inviting.  They did not slice the meat in front of me like I am used to with deli's the meat was in a cooler with the cheeses and condiments.  The same lady who does the cash register also makes your sandwiches and she does not wear gloves or washes her hands, very disgusting to eat food which someone handles money and then makes your sandwich without washing their hands.  The cashier did mention everything is homemade by her father which I had to wonder since they have boxes of food in their freezer not home made but the cheescake comes from someplace else.  The salads and rice pudding looked disgusting.  I know they just celebrated their 38th year but I wish they went back to when they had the slicer out and sliced the meats in front of you and washed their hands before service.  Not a good place to go for fresh food.  The hero was good my friend said I told him I would not eat it because the lady had dirty hands, but he ate it and like it.  if you go ask the lady to wash her hands first, not sure if she will but then ask her to use gloves if they have none, then you know what kind of establishment it is.  Good heros bad etiquette. They operate the same way as subway except subway employees wear gloves.  Want an authentic NY Hero from Subway just bring in a Hoagie roll and they will make you a sandwich, it is all about the bread. Casellas also raised their prices now a 6 inch Hero with roast beef and cheese is $7.65... no more $6 Heros.  Not worth it especially since their are other options and the food or the employees wash their hands or wear gloves elsewhere. Bacteria is terrible to get from someone not have the decency to wash their hands and touch food.  Disgusting, Disgusting, Disgusting!!!",

    "text": "I'm sorry but who says a deli, any deli has to make their food the way you expect them to, or the way you've had it at other delis, or (shudder) the way the fast food chains make it?  Ok, I take that back, no I'm not sorry ... the whole idea of a small, local 42 year-old mom and pop deli is that they have the right to make their food any way they want to make it.  Your only say in the matter is if you don't like the way they make it you have the right to eat elsewhere.  I'm from the east coast where there is a corner deli on, um, every corner and some have been there a lot longer than 42 years.  What makes them unique is that they make their food their way just like their family has made it for generations. Each has its fans, diehard fans that wouldn't eat anyplace else.. When we stopped into Casella's recently for lunch we ran into someone we know who has been eating there since he was a kid and doing so for the very reason that this place doesn't change their family recipe every time an out-of-town first-time visitor happens to stumble on the place and whines because it's not what they're used to (and they swear they will never come back).  Which customer do you think Casella's needs most?  Here's the experience:  you walk in and the first thing is a family member greets you and asks if it's you're first time there.  They do that because you haven't been coming there since you were a kid and they don't recognize your face.  The second thing is they tell you (with pride) that they've been there for 42 years and the third thing is they give you a friendly heads-up that they're cash only.  That's a good thing (if you know that fact in advance - it keeps the prices low.  Then they offer to give you a taste of any of their salads while you decide what you want, which won't take long because they have a very simple menu.  Their sandwiches are big for the price but not super-size ridiculous.  They're made simple like your mom used to make them and not loaded with a lot of cheap fillers.  You can't help but notice how down to earth and friendly everyone is.  I make a point of that because it's not uncommon in some old mom and pop businesses to see family members at each other's throats and wishing they were anywhere but working for the family business.  I had a Philly Cheese Steak and it was made homestyle, which is to say with gravy. While the preferences in Philly sandwiches run very strong about the \"right\" way to make a cheesesteak this one was in a category by itself.  True the gravy makes it different but different can be good and this one nailed it at being good.  The place is clean and not fancy, in fact it looks like it hasn't changed much in 42 years.  There are plenty of tables and it doesn't take forever to get served.  Everything added together - price, quality, service, cleanliness - you really can't go wrong here.",

    "text": "Since I don't live in this area I don't visit very often.  However, looking at my previous review of several years ago, I would say things have changed.  First, I like family-owned businesses like this.  That's always a plus for me because you are more likely to get fresh ingredients, and custom ingredients (e.g. homemade sausage, homemade bread, etc).  And they have a stake in the place, so they're more eager to treat their customers well.  In this case the ladies behind the counter were very friendly and helpful. No problems there.  I ordered meatballs this time. My wife had the Italian hoagie, and we ordered a cold pastrami to take home (they had a buy two get one free deal this day).  Unlike another deli I know in Chandler, they do NOT make their own sausage here.  Which is why I didn't order that.  They also don't make their own bread.  Which is a shame.  Stuff like that makes a deli stand out.  The meatball sub was fine.  Nothing special, but I would order it again if I came back.  The Italian hoagie and pastrami were both very mild, and both a bit light on the meat.  I remember them piling the meat on last time, but apparently not any more.  Skimp on the meat, and a bit excessive on the lettuce.  Not a good way to build a sandwich.  The flavors were not robust at all.  Which was disappointing.  I don't think I would order either of those again.  Last time I rated four stars, but either I got lucky last time, or we ordered the wrong things this time, or they aren't what they were a few years ago.  In any event, I cannot get to three stars here.  Especially when I contrast to another four-star deli I know in Chandler (in fact, I was there just last week).  I want to go higher, but based on this meal I just can't.  I could get to 2.5 stars because of the service-with-a-smile of the ladies, but the food just didn't measure up today.",

It has a homey, small town, cafe/restaurant feel.  I was warmly welcomed and they explained the menu, the food, the family.  I felt like I was at home and loved (anyhow, i think that's how it would feel).  It was fantastic.  They have a sandwich menu and also a hot tray area filled with meats, pastas, cold salads, etc.  ask for a sample, they offered me one and I tried out the potato salad.  It was delish.  I just opted for a cheesesteak hot sandwich.  Cheese, beef, lettuce, tomato, mayo and grilled onions.  Mom grills it up fresh for you.  No precooked meat served for the cheesesteak.  Imthe sandwich was perfectly adorned on a crusty baguette.  I will be back, looking forward to taking my kids back.  Oh!!!  Best thing ever, they sold bags of freshly made Pizzelle(sp?) cookies.  Just like my BFs Italian family would make at home.  Out of this world!",

The meat was bland and like others have mentioned there was really nothing that made this even partially memorable... Just warmed unflavored beef on a partially dry roll with a bit of cheese that didn't do anything for the flavor...and the au jus which was sour and gross. I think a lot of the positive reviews are because it's a family business but like the others have mentioned, a bigger component should be the food itself...and also the lack of credit card processing. The service was good and the people seem nice hence the 3 stars. The above represents solely my opinion.  \"My review is strictly my opinion based on my experience and interaction with the business and/or persons while they provided me a service, food, or merchandise.

I had great conversation while waiting for my beef. This very adorable family owned restaurant not only offers fabulous customer service but there Italian Beef was outstanding. The best I've had in the valley. I have been searching all over Phoenix for a Italian joint like this and I've finally found it. I have not yet tried other items on the menu but if they are as great as the Italian Beef, I'll be spending a lot of my time and money here.

I have been going here for at least 30 years.  They have maintained this place meticulously over the coarse of years.  It has been in this same strip mall location for over 30 and some of its old neighbors that have come and gone include a skate shop \"Cheap Skate\" and a record store \"The Singing Dog\", both of which I would loiter on a regular basis back in the day.    First thing you will notice when you walk in is the awesome wood paneling.  Way old school, no frills decor.   They same meat cases, refrigerator....  you get the idea.  In fact, the little pin-up menu hasn't even changed either.  Still the little black style with the press in letters.  The menu is simple.  Sandwiches, chips and a drink.  They make the best meatballs for ala carte munching or sandy style.  This is my favorite...  but close on it's heels are the Hoagie and the Pepper steak works.  Buy one of those giant pickles in the back case.    I ran into a friend there, as I usually do.  He had a very tasty looking pastrami on rye.  Oh, be sure to check out all the Saguaro High School class photos since...  I dunno, maybe 1985?  Every year since!  I am in the 1990 one!",

I like that the place had not seen a decorator in 34 years.  Actually, I don't think it saw one then.  In a deli, I'm looking for a good sandwich for a good price.  I'm not interested in paying $17.95 for a turkey sandwich so they can recoup the cost of an overpriced interior designer.  And I got just that.  An excellent Italian beef sandwich as well as the biggest pickle I have ever seen.  And in following my new half-star policy, bumping up to 5 stars because the gals at the counter were so welcoming to everyone who came in.  And Mr. Casella himself took the time to say hello while we were waiting.  They also run a buy 2-get 1 free special during the week late afternoons.",

The italian sub was pretty decent, not overdone with dressing.  The italian beef was different than the style I'm used to (Chicago style), but it wasn't bad especially with the au jus that came with it.  The bread used in all these sandwiches were pretty good.  I wish they had more toppings - I like to get jalapeno or banana peppers on my sandwiches.  Seems like they have limited toppings that they would place on a given sub unless specially requested?  The sandwiches aren't bad and they're very nice people.  However, these are not $7 subs.",

    "text": "Don't be fooled by the simple decor and wood paneling, this deli can pump out some of the best food you have ever had, promise. Most of the food is homemade by the Casella family, like the roast beef, meatballs, lasagna, chicken salad, well you get the idea.  Along with great food it is a family owned customer service experience.  They know the regulars by name, everyone is greeted when they walk in and they strive to make you happy.  With its location close to the 101 it is an excellent location for lunch or to swing by and pick up some dinner, until 6pm.  A couple of recommendations: 1 - Have the steak works with sauce. 2 - Try the chicken salad. 3 - Bring cash, they don't take anything else. 4 - Have a canoli, best ever.  Just to drive my point home, they have been in business in the same location for 35 years, run by the same family.  Go, enjoy and support this exemplary local business.",

They were celebrating their 35th year anniversary and were thrilled to find out I was visiting for the first time.  I met the owner Joe and his wife Tina.  They make a point of introducing themselves and making you feel very welcome.  You can taste-test all of their salads.  (Their chicken salad and baked beans are delicious) I am so glad for yelp helping me find all of these little gems that would have remained hidden! BTW, cheese steak is amazing.

This is a real family place, owner and his wife and children all work here, its a small deli and it is a CASH ONLY place!  They are very kind people and really appreciate your business. The cannoli looked great but it wasnt until later that evening that we realized these are TOP NOTCH! The shell was crispy and even after having the filling inside they were crispy, no sogginess to be found! They were fully filled and super delicious.  They also make steak sandwiches and a yummy chicken salad we were given a sample of.  Thanks again Joe!",

Let's see what happens..... Didn't  get what i ordered...cheese steak with peppers...no peppers to be found. Nobody likes when someone  tells them they didn't do something when they know for sure they did. Customers hate it even more (being called a liar instead of saying oops miscommunication).  I didnt turn my car around in 105 degree weather to get 30 cents worth of peppers for free,  i did it cuz owner talked it up so much i had to try sandwich at traffic light to see for myself how good the sandwich with peppers would be. Okay. Enough soap boxing.  The cheese steak has a very oniony tomatoe sauce with some mozzarella and it was good. I love onions.   It's a decent neighbourhood shop, but not really worth a pilgrimage for.  However, if you do go, bring cash because they don't accept any form of plastic and make sure to have them repeat order back to you!! Giving 3 stars instead of 2 cuz i know miscommunication happens which is why they should write down the order for audit trail purposes instead of immediately assuming the customer doesn't know what they said.",

Yes, it is cash only but if you know that before you go, what is the big complaint? This is a family business.

The two women asked my name, welcomed me and I placed my order to go. I ordered an Philly Cheese steak with onions and a chicken salad sandwich. Both were delicious. The bread is the best roll I have had in Phoenix. Just like back east. Out here in Phoenix the bread they serve at sandwich places is...YUCK, kind of subway sandwich bread. To me the roll is important and this one hit the spot.   Very casual, limited hours, Monday Thru Friday, 11Am to 6Pm, Saturday, 11Am to 3PM. I am definitely a regular now.",

I obliged, and tasted the filling and it was satisfactory. I didn't want to be rude so I still ordered a few cannolis giving the establishment the benefit of the doubt that they would be better in their wrapping. Boy was I wrong... The wrapping was poor at best. It was much too hard and pretty much ruined my day. The bubbly women told me that if I wanted to order some for the holidays I would have to order them far in advance as there are so many people ordering them during the holiday season. Pfffff no need to worry about that, as I will not be back. I don't know if the people who are ordering these cannolis in mass are stupid or just have never had a proper cannoli. I guess I'll just choose to believe the latter. PS I am writing this as I sit on my toilet with explosive diarrhea, that I suspect was caused from the cannoli.",

The Philly cheesesteak and pizza hoagie were also delicious. Joe came out and sat with us and was so friendly. Definitely would eat here often if I wasn't from out of town!",

I had the cheese steak sandwich and my husband had the steak works with the sides of coleslaw and potato salad. It was heavenly and the family that ran the place were so friendly and kind. Clean facility, everything was fresh! A must eat!!",

This is an Italian Deli which seems to be frequented often by regulars and locals which is always a good sign. The customer service here seems to be very good as well in which it looks like a family run business. They only accept cash here though so keep that in mind.  I really liked their cheesesteak sandwiches and would definitely go back for them again.",

I watched the lady cash out someone before me touch the money and the register and than go make someone else's sandwich. I'd pass on that.",

They are all super sweet.    The cheese steak is out of this world.  It is not your Philly style cheese steak. But it is a must have for me.  The meatball and Italian beef subs are a close 2nd choice.  And the cold Italian Combo sub, also delicious!  And I dig the yummy potato salad.  And definitely do not miss out on the amazing cookies ... off the hook!!    They close at 6 PM, so hurry up and call in your order!",

I hope they never change that. it's like visiting my in law's house",

My favorite side is the Health Salad which is carrots, cucumbers and celery marinated in tangy sweet dressing that I dip my sandwiches in.  Above this fabulous place, I hold most dearly the kind people that work here. It's a family run business that has been around since the seventies. Every single one of them will say hi when a customer walks in and knows their loyal patrons by name and even, remarkably, remembers what they love to eat. This is a True gem. I recommend everyone to enjoy the deliciousness that is Casella's.",
