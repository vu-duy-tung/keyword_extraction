I miss it.   I would definitely recommend splitting a bruschetta plate. You could split it as an appetizer with 2-4 people. You get 4 giant bruschetta (you choose 4 different ones from a large variety) and then each one is cute into 4 strips because they are so big. I guess... It could be 2 people's meals (or one hungry person) or an appetizer for 3-4.  Service... was okay. They are really busy, always.",

Reasons why I love Postinos, and you may too :)  1) Great building with modern/chic decor - There's ample indoor and outdoor patio seating, and it's the perfect spot for lunch with the girls, or a date, or whatever! Parking can sometimes be tricky, but 9 out of 10 times, the valet guys will be there to help you (valet is free!)  2) Butcher's Block Appetizer - $14 and well worth it and perfect to share - It's loaded with an assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini - Yum!  3) Bruschetta - $14 for a choice of 3 - The bruschetta is made with beautiful thick, large slices of crispy, fresh bread, and topped with all sorts of delicious toppings. My favorites are 1) the Brie, Apples and Fig Spread, 2) Prosciutto with Figs and Mascapone and 3) Salami with Pesto  4) The Wines! Great selection of wines ; there's something for everyone.  5) Happy Hour! $5 glasses of wine/beer Everyday between 11am-5pm !",

    "text": "If there was ever a restaurant deserving 5 stars, this is it.  We met some friends here on our last night in Arizona and it made a great book-end for the trip. We went on Monday, when they have a $20 deal for a bottle of wine and a plate of bruschetta. The wine that they serve is their \"house\" wine, but it knocks the socks off of your typical house wine. The Bruschetta makes a great meal by itself if you want. There are 11 choices (various toppings) and you can have up to four different ones per plate (really a long-handled cutting board, which makes for a nice presentation). The Bruschetta is carefully sliced into smaller pieces so that several people can try each kind. Be prepared to eat and drink a lot; it is such a deal that you will have a hard time saying \"no.\"  I mostly stuck to the beer that was on draft. There were only two choices, both very good. The draft beer was fresh and refreshing, plus at $7.50 for a small pitcher anytime it was quite a deal. If you come for the earlier happy hour it is $5/pitcher or $5 for a glass of wine, so you can't go wrong. It makes sense to have a small draft beer selection since they are a wine bar and it helps them move through the kegs quickly. I ordered the prosciutto with brie panini, which I had no trouble sharing with my friends. You get the choice of ciabatta or focaccia bread and fresh-made chips or salad- the chips and ciabatta bread were great. Our server helped me pick the ciabatta bread, which she accurately described as the \"thinner, crispier\" one for my panini.  The service here is amazing. Our servers were very patient and helpful. The busser would give any Indian restaurant a run for their money with his diligent water-refilling, plus he was thoughtful enough to get our server's attention if we needed anything else. Everyone was dressed nicely and very friendly. At one point a piece of bruschetta fell onto the table or the floor. Without even mentioning it, out server brought over a replacement. She must have noticed from somewhere else in the restaurant and wanted to help.  The restaurant had a very appealing atmosphere. Lights were dim, but not dark. The colors on the walls made it feel vibrant. Chairs and tables were comfortable, well-maintained, and fit in with the style of the restaurant. It might have been louder if we sat inside, but we were on the patio. Outside we sat in the shade (we arrived when it was still daylight) and the water misters helped keep us cool. The bathrooms are in the back corner, opposite of the front door. You might have to ask a server to point out where to go, but they are glad to help. The fact that the bathrooms simply say \"Both\" could be an interesting conversation point if you have to wait in line.  The parking is valet, but you shouldn't be driving anyway. Take a cab if you can help it, or bring a designated driver. The experience is so nice that you won't want to leave, unless maybe you make a friend to bring with you.",

The former postal location with it's huge windows and open space.It's \"just off the beaten path\" feel-- just a couple streets away from the main streets Camelback and Indian School, yet feels so far away. The fact that it's in Milano's mega-plaza next to LGO and other great places...it just all works for me.   The wine is mostly good, although the selections could use a little more of an updating, but the prices are definitely right. Come before 5pm and all glasses of wine are only $5. Boyfriend and I have spent countless of lazy weekends lazing around this place with wine and their wonderful, orgasmic, bruschetta. The service is good and the people are friendly. The sandwiches are okay, but don't stand a chance next to the bruschetta and I wasn't a fan of the soup at all.   Parking can be tough at times, but it's not impossible. Truly, a neighborhood gem not to be missed.   Bruschetta favorites:  -Prosciutto,fig, and marscapone (which I have successfully replicated at -home!) -Roasted pepper and goat cheese -Smoked salmon, cream cheese, caper -Salami, pesto",

The special starts at 8pm, we got there over 45 min early one night and the wait was an hour and a half. I wish they would either extend the hours, get extra table or do something so they can accommodate all of their clients. They will accept reservations if you have a party of 8 or more. So last Mon. we called ahead and made reservations for our large group, we arrived 20 min early to ensure that they would have enough time to get our table ready and they told us that they just gave our tables away to 2 smaller groups.

Postino's Arcadia location is the original forerunner in the revitalization of the Phoenix scene. Postino. Cleverly located in a former Post Office. Thanks USPS.    If you find yourself here with a wait (not always, but sometimes) look about yourself. The patrons at this location are uber friendly. With a larger-than-average number of regulars, some of them have very good stories to share, and are particularly generous.   We waited one night and had two gentlemen with a high top table offer to let us share their space. It was a rousing good time full of mutual ease, and they left before our party of 3 had finished. When we went to pay, we found out they had taken care of the entire bill. Thanks guys!  It's that kinda place.

    "text": "Went back in the evening for some more of the delicious bruschetta!  This time I went with another friend and we shared that plus the artichoke dip and a sandwich.  We over ordered, but I wanted to try something new this time. He wanted the \"Nine Iron\" which has chicken, bacon, mozzarella, lettuce, tomato, and dijionnaise on ciabatta.  It was rather tasty, however, the ratio of fillings felt a little off.  I love tomato, so it wasn't a big deal to me, but the sandwich was full of it with one thin little leaf of lettuce and clumps of chicken that weren't evenly distributed between the ciabatta.  I ended up opening the sandwich and rearranging the ingredients myself in order to help it along.  Fresh produce, good flavors and amazing bruschetta!  Honestly, I don't think you can really go wrong ordering it.  The service we received this time around wasn't up to par, but decent enough.  We didn't get our water refilled and the waiter never came back again so that we could order more drinks.  It was a shame.  The food still salvaged the visit though.  I just hope it doesn't happen too frequently since I plan to come here more often with some more friends.  This time we sat on the patio since it was a little quieter in order to chat and despite the chillier weather (I say that loosely, since I'm from Chicago and shouldn't really complain...) I found the outdoor torch like heaters (no, I don't know the technical term for them and apologize for that) to be perfect along with my jacket. Next time around, I think I'll try the soup and salad!",

I would recommend a Tempranillo if you want a red wine that is more fruity but not as strong as Carbenet.  Be aware that gratuity is 20% for a large group and parking is limited around the restaurant (although they do have valet for $3).",

One of the walls is a giant garage door that they roll up so the whole place is open.  Little couches and coffee tables are mixed in with tables and high tops for a variety of seating choices.  The bathrooms are lovely, clean, and lit by candles.  The salads are my favorite in Phoenix and the bruschetta is out of this world.   Come early, get your table and enjoy!",

The four of us shared the Bruschetta SELECTION OF 4, so we all got to pick and share...  We enjoyed the Brie & Apple w/Fig Spread, Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, and Warm Artichoke Spread.  Their portions are very generous and each bruschetta is cut in 4 so you don't have to struggle with it yourself.  Anyone who knows me well, knows I ALWAYS slice my sandwiches in 4...easier to eat :-)  Wine by the glass 11am-5pm 7 days a week...yay!!!",

I was eager to order from their impressive wine list (definitely next time), but my friend influenced me to taste the sangria... which I'm normally not a big fan of...

First, for white wine lovers, go for the Emeri.  Sparkling Sauvignon Blanc. Amazing. Amazing. Amazing!   And I haven't found anywhere else that carries this brand. Forego the glass, just get the whole bottle if you have someone to share it with.  This is a good place for a dates or hanging out with a few friends (more intimate, smaller group), not as great for a big group.  My recco is not to do dinner there (though their grilled cheese and soup is delish and the apple & brie bruschetta rocks too) but go for the wine and leave room for dessert.  They are all delicious.  The portion sizes are just right for sharing.  Creme brulee is my favorite and the salted caramel sundae is also divine (chocolate covered corn nuts? who knew these were so tasty!).    If you aren't in a wine mood  - though why would you be at a wine bar then - the Mr. Qcumber Soda is a unique little refreshing beverage.    Enjoy!",

Appetizers took 30 min to arrive, then she asked if it would be okay the serve our main courses at the same time. We said no and continued. We finished our appetizers and about 20 min. later the server made to back to our table. Our main course meals were horrible both overcooked overcooked, reheated or whatever, not edible. We spoke with the manager, returned the food, paid and left. The bill would have been $100.+ for very substandard food but the manager did credit us for the bad food. Our server never offered to refill our drinks (beer and mixed drink) pure profit for the biz. We left once again disappointed with service and food.

My amore and I decided to give this place a whirl on a Friday night, and we enjoyed every second of our experience. Upon arrival, we were told that there was an hour and a half wait, so we ventured into the bar area to have a glass of Prosecco, which was DELICIOUS by the way. About thirty minutes later, we were seated and looking over the menu. The wait was cut in half! I would have waited 6 hours for their bruschetta, though. We sampled four of their bruschetta selections, and not one piece was left behind. Their portions are large, and definately made for sharing. We topped off our scrumptious experience with an espresso and a salted caramel sundae. Im pretty sure my tastebuds are still dancing around.....As far as the service goes, it needs help. Our server was horrible. He refilled our water glasses ONCE and relied on other staff members to bring us our check. At the beginning of our visit, we were greeted by the owner, and he personally brought us a wine list, took our drink order, AND opened our vino, table side. That is so refreshing to see when the owner of a place puts his own elbow grease into maintaining his business. This place has an amazing, simple menu. Its an ideal place to take a date!!",

Living in the area for the last several years, Postino's was my go-to place for everything from Saturday night celebrations to making a Monday just a little special. The wine is great, the menu is perfect, the ambiance is downright delightful. It's the staff that makes me cringe. On a recent visit, the snobby hostess told us the wait was 2 hours... But no one was there ... And there were empty tables ... Something did not seem right and when I asked her about it again, she rudely just stared at me. 2 hours later, we got seated and ignored. It took another hour (!) for our bruschetta to arrive to our table. We left feeling hungry  and  neglected. The worst part is that I started to ask around and I have three (3) other friends with almost the exact same experience. After so many happy years at Postino's, I won't go back to the Arcadia location. On the bright side, the Central location boasts the same menu minus the horrid staff.",

    "text": "I'm on a huge Postino kick lately and had another awesome dinner there last night with five girlfriends.  Since my last review of this place was in 2008, I figured it was time for an update, but honestly, not too much has changed since then - I'm a very loyal customer and have been for years!  My favorite menu items are still the same too: The artichoke dip (which actually comes with hummus too but I always special request double artichoke instead because I love it so much), the mixed green salad with added turkey, chicken, or prosciutto, and the bruschetta board... My top two bruschetta faves are Brie & Apple with Fig Spread and Prosciutto, Fig & Mascarpone. Mmmmm!  I'm not currently drinking (I'm prego again), but of course this is the perfect place to go for a glass of wine or four as well!    Service is always fabulous and the atmosphere rocks too.  So in my eyes, this place deserves five stars... even almost five years from my original review!  Of course, it is worth noting that it's not only a favorite of mine, there are plenty of others that love it too... so, sometimes you may have to wait a bit.  If you've got a large party (eight or more), I highly recommend making a reservation ahead of time.",

(Yes I know I am writing this review late) I had heard so much about it from friends that visited Phoenix and just from reading reviews of it on Yelp! When I saw that every day they had HH from 11AM until 5pm for $5 glasses of wine and $5 pitchers, I knew this was going to be at the top of my list for Phoenix and it did not disappoint. JTW and I split a BRUSCHETTA board as an afternoon snack and there was plenty for the both of us. We also got a couple of glasses of delicious wine each, which our waiter was extremely helpful with. He helped us narrow down our choices and even gave us samples of them before we finalized our decision. It was really hot and humid the day we were there so we sat indoors, but once the weather cools off, I definitely want to sit outside on their patio. They have few tall bar stool/tables, some tables in the center of the room, and couches to lounge on in one corner of the room.   Definitely a cute date spot or a girls night out type of place.   HH: 11AM til 5PM every day. $5 glasses of wine and $5 pitchers of beer Monday and Tuesdays: 8PM to close. $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta board. (DEFINITELY coming back for that one)",

My favorites:  ricotta and pistachios, white bean and tomato, Brie apples and fig, bacon buratta...well they are all so good!!   Go on a Monday or Tuesday after 8pm for Happy Hour and you can choose any bottle of house wine and 4 bruschetta for $20!! The best place for happy hour!! If you are going to go though make sure you are there by 7:30 or 8 at the latest or you won't get a table until after 9 because everyone knows about Postino's Happy Hour and it is legendary!!   On a side note the raspberry chicken salad is probably the yummiest salad I have ever eaten!!",

    "text": "My boyfriend and I just left the Arcadia location and by far had the worst service we've ever experienced. When our server finally came over we ordered a butcher's block to start, a bruschetta board, and a panini. She said she was going to course it out for us which is exactly what we wanted! Our appetizer took longer than usual but it was still great. Our server had not checked on us once. The last time we saw her was when she had taken our order and at this point we had already been there for an hour. A table that was sat maybe 20-25 minutes after us had already gotten their food and we still hadn't received ours. We called someone over to see what was going on and to just grab our check because it was honestly ridiculous that we still didn't have anything. He said he would check and grab it for us. When he came back he just put down our check and left. Since he didn't update us at all, we decided to just pay and leave. Finally, our server came over and picked up our check but she was confused when it only had our appetizer on it. I told her we were frustrated because we've been waiting 40 minutes for our food. I'm not sure if she just forgot to put it in after doing the entree or what. I get that things happen, because I'm a server as well. It was crazy that no one had even said anything or a manager didn't even come over to apologize. After she ran my card she came back with our food boxed up and apologized. But at that point we didn't even want to eat there anymore because it took so long. I'll be sticking to the Tempe location since I never have issues there. Just sad that this was my boyfriends first time at the restaurant in general and it was such a bad experience!",

Place looks like it could have been an old post office in another lifetime. Inside has been redecorated and there is a really nice patio for you outdoors folks. No need to check your mail here. Just order what looks good and they deliver it right to your table.  Started with the Butcher's Block Starter plate and an ice cold Italian Beer. It was beautiful and tasty at the same time. Decided to go with the famous Bruschetta next. What did we not try is the question. There are so many choices.  Brie & Apple with Fig Spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Warm Artichoke Spread, the yummy Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios and a few others that were not so great.  We all enjoyed anything with Figs on it. The plates were very colorful and the quality of the food was very high and fresh. Sounds like a good portion of their products come from right here in the valley. Nice!  Recommend coming here during the day and not at night. The lighting is very dim and we had to use a flashlight app on my phone to see the food and menu. Maybe I'm justing getting too old for the late night thing.  Seen other reviews saying that the best areas to sit are on the patio or right between the inside and outdoor seating area. Not sure how that works when it is a crisp 118 degrees outside. I bet the cheese starts melting rather fast.  Definitely a fun and enjoyable time. The Bruschetta is out of this world and a new favorite of mine. Looking forward to trying out some of the other locations. SALUTE!  4.25 STARS",

After waiting close to 50 minutes I decided we should walk back up to the entrance in hopes we would be called soon. After seating us - I received a text message about 8 minutes later saying that our table was ready. When in fact there was no one waiting/sitting around for a table- which makes me wonder had I just walked up sooner would I have been seated sooner. The food was fine, wine suggestion was fine.

I tried some of her Prosciutto with Brie panini, that comes with fig jam and arugula - that was really really good. Heavy on the prosciutto, light on the fig jam - an excellent balance :)  They also have happy hour drinks 7 days a week -- all wines $5/glass, draft beers $5/pitcher -- worth noting!  Overall I liked the place and the prices were great, but I think my expectations of a soulful renovated historic post office were maybe too high.",

I have been to all of the locations and my experience at this location has unfortunately changed.   When I first stated going to this Postino I loved it! Me and my roommate would visit every Sunday religiously. We always got great service! Food was fantastic and timely. But it seems as if the the 40th street location is either under new management or just has new rude employees. I no longer go to this location because of a couple negative encounters with servers. I had no idea it was there business how many women I take on dates there. You would think the business would be appreciated. I was shocked when a server made a snide comment about my dating habits right in front of a lady friend. I would have been pretty pissed if that was an actual date. Very unprofessional staff at this location!  I recommend going to the newer Central & Camelback location if you are planning on visiting Postino.   Pros: - cheap tasty bruschetta - reasonable wine prices - decent beers on tap - crazy fast but borderline annoying water refills - short wait times  Cons - rude servers - shallow menu - bad for taking dates",

Postino Arcadia is right down the street from where I live, I frequent here and have never had a bad experience.  One thing to keep in mind though is during happy hour, the wait can be a little long, but that is a good thing though, people enjoy going to Postino.",

    "text": "Came to this location back in March and was very disappointed with the service. First off it was extremely cold in the restaurant for some reason and when we asked if the air could be turned off or get moved the server just kind of laughed it off and didn't take us seriously. That already left a bad taste in my mouth. Second they server was not very accommodating... My dad asked if he could sub a soup for a salad and she flat out said no. Would not even check or anything. We were willing to pay a bit more for a sub but no she didn't care. Finally when we actually got our food the bread for the sandwiches and bruschetta were so stale and old. I don't usually write bad reviews but this time I was beyond unsatisfied and this was after talking up this restaurant to my dad visiting from out of town. Will probably just stick to the Tempe or Central locations from now on.",

Really, the best lunch in town.   Service is always on top of it and friendly. Really outstanding.   My one note was my last experience - I came in Saturday and had a very unpleasant experience with the valet manager -  Logan. He was being so rude and short with us we almost left ! All we asked was - since when they block all the spot when you turn in to Postino Arcadia as it used to be available to self part.  If this was my first time coming to Postino - I probably would have... It was still great once we went it. As always is :-)",

    "text": "\"Eat me\"  Yep, that's what everything (the food) said to me as it came out. That about sums up my experience.. but read on for more specifics.  Service: TOP notch service. Our waiter was patient and super attentive. He knew the menu and even said, that's why I work here because EVERYTHING is good!  Food: We started with the spinach artichoke/white bean hummus combo and the grilled cheese.. yes.. folks grilled cheese. This was by far the best grilled cheese I've had..ever and that says a lot. It was on a nice flaky break with the perfect amount of gooey-ness. It was served with a ketchup, fancy mustard, and pesto. Fabuloso!  For the entree - I had the tomato florentine - I felt like it was missing a spice, but it was still good. I had the chicken and mozzarella panini and the mixed greens salad. Albeit I was stuffed, it was amazing and tasted even better the next day.  The other perk is they have a focused menu. They aren't trying to be everything to everyone. Another bonus!  The open doors/windows, patio seating and coziness of the restaurant was a perk.  The only thing I wish there was more of was light. It was very hard to read the menu using a small candle. It wasn't enough for me to take this down a star though.",

    "text": "Postino Winecafe remains very close to my heart. In a foodie way, too.  My boyfriend and I came here on a hot humid Thursday night. The lightings were great to bring a date or to catch up with a friend and there were fairly good amount of room noise to keep your conversation on the privacy level. The service was just lovely. Oh, the little \"Gum\" note-card was utterly cute. You can either spit your gum on the note-card or exchange phone numbers. :)  The first time I visited Postino, I wanted to come back for more of their bruschettas. My boyfriend and I shared the various bruschetta platter:  1. Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - He quickly picked this because the first time he had it became his favorite and was confident that I would absolutely love it, and I did -- I loved the sweet taste of the fig with the crunchiness of the apples. yummm! The composition of the brie, apples and fig gives this bruschetta a sweet taste. 2. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - Since we had 3 more bruschetta options to pick, we went for something light and simple. Everything was fresh! The combination of the mozzarella, tomato and basil was simple yet blended wonderfully together.  3. Smoked Salmon with Pesto - This was probably my least favorite out of the four, but it was okay. Although the capers were mouth bursting with favors -- which was delish, but it didn't do much justice for the slight fishy taste of the smoked salmon. 4. Ricotta with Dates and Pistachios - By the end of the night, he declared that this became our favorite bruschetta, evar! I think they toasted the dates a bit or something of that sort, but it was perfect. The pistachios weren't dry and the ricotta wasn't an overload. All three components made it tasted like sweet heaven in your mouth. When I think of bruschetta, I immediately think savory, but there's nothing wrong with a dessert bruschetta, right? I think not. The texture of this was just perfect. No complaints here!  He and I tend to order enough to feed 4 hungry men when we dine out. So we also called for the Panini -- the Vegetarian Panini on ciabatta to be exact. We had the side salad with crumb goat cheese. Meh, I didn't care much for this panini, maybe because I was already full off of the tasty bruschettas!  There's a $3 charge for Valet. But it's all worth it! I am definitely coming back for their bruschettas once I fly out there.",

My favorite things on the menu are as follows:  The olive appetizer (I LOVE olives), the cheese course, the bruschetta (you get to pick a few ingredients to put on it and it's amazing), the vegetarian panini and the warm chocolate tarte. I've never had a bad food or wine experience at Postino, and I could tell that the staff is highly trained on all menu items and the wine they offer- which is a refreshing change.   Our server also recommended a really good dessert wine to go with the tarte, and it was fantastic. I wish I could remember the name of it, but I can't.",

Plus the night we were there, the doors were open which allowed an open, airy feel. The wine list isn't huge, which is surprising for a wine bar...I didn't sample any of the wines (I'm waiting to go back for lunch one day for the $5 glasses), but the beer list was good. You can't go wrong with a place that serves Stella Artois, one of my favorite beers.  We had the bruschetta and it was filling enough for dinner. We had a double order of the brie, green apple and fig spread (absolutely delicious); tomato, mozzarella and basil (my least favorite of the third we tried...not enough mozzarella for me); and the roasted peppers and goat cheese (I didn't try it because my husband hogged it, so obviously it was a winner with him).  Our bill was $40 which included the bruschetta, 4 drinks, tax and tip. Not bad at all!  Yes the parking lot is super small, so most likely you'll have to valet for $3. It didn't bother me since I was expecting it, and when our car had to be brought around, it was fast.",

After hearing so many great things about Postino, I was quite disappointed that night. My panini was just.   Yup. just.   Second time: I came here with a friend and it was his first time. Since it was our 3rd stop for happy hour that night, it was a bit hazy.   Third time: I decided to try this place again with my brother and my sorority sister who needed a ride to the airport. We did the bruschetta, and bottle of wine for $20, and it more than made up for my first experience here. The Grayson was such a good cabernet selection. My brother even bought another bottle to take home for our dad's birthday. It's also $9 off any bottle you buy to take home. We ordered our board of 4 bruschetta, and although they made a mistake on two, they made it up to us by bringing out the original two we ordered, so we tried 6 different bruschettas. They were all different, ranging from sweet to savory, but none of them were bad.   The service here is really awesome, and it's consistently good. I can't wait to come back to try the other bruschetta flavors!",

The salads are very flavorful, but I'd rather eat bread with goat cheese and roasted red peppers, or brie and apples, or hot artichoke spread...or...you get the picture. Double delight: you can walk across the parking lot and enter the back door of La Grand Orange and get fabulous Tammy Coe cakes and cupcakes, as well as big, yummy cookies and a variety of other delights.

After walking in and not seeing anyone seating, we sat ourselves. The ONE hostess on duty then scolded us for doing so. Then after being confused, within 15 minutes three diff servers approached our table. One with water, one for a drink order and one to take our order. None of them smiled or seemed to care to wait on us, probably bc we weren't drinking wine. If it wasn't for the remarkable bruschetta and proscuttio sandwich, I would have left.

Prosciutto, marscapone cheese and figs are Camille H's favorite. I could eat an entire plate of the salmon pesto bruschetta. The artichoke was amazing as was the roasted pepper and goat cheese. My mouth is watering, just thinking about it!!! Camille H and I have been here a few times and always do bruschettta and share the picnic salad - goat cheese, beets, bacon.....so so wonderful.   This place is loud - not necessarily a good place for a  first date if you want to get to know each other, unless yelling is your thing. Although, if you are both very hot, and love to see and be seen, this is a great spot for that!  I would NOT recommend bringing a child here. It's too loud and the food has too many \"adult\" ingredients.  OH and I learned (the $3 way) that you always say to the Valet that you are going to Le Grand Orange, and not Postino because then you don't have to pay for the valet service.",

Now that I've finally made it to Postino, my lamentations will only grow.  Yeah, it's wonderful.

She handed me off to Maya, who was also supremely patient with my many questions and general ignorance of wine.  Yeah, I'm not a wine snob. I have little patience for sniffing and swirling. I've good wines and bad wines, but I'm fairly convinced anyone talking about the boquet of light oak with a strong raspberry melon finish is making it up or part of a cult.  Didn't matter, though. Maya recommended a fantastic wine, and between her and Carla I sorted out which of their famous bruschetta I was going to try (proscutto + fig, salmon + capers, tomato jam + goat cheese, apple + brie).    The garage doors were open and the weather was fantastic. Loved the decor, loved the staff, loved the food, and loved the... what's that other stuff they served.., oh yeah, the wine.  (sigh) Between this place and LGO it may be cheaper for me to just move again further away.",

You can choose not to have the bottle opened and to go it home! =)   Bruschetta assortment is just unbelievably great!  Definitely put me in a food coma on the 7 hour drive home.   I rarely give 5 stars, but Postinos deserved it because the employees are soooo amiable consistenly checking up on our table. With such a long day in Sedona I had 8-10cups of water and there wasn't a moment I had to \"ask\" for water like other establishments.  Employees must of had very keen eye-vision because it was quite dark in the room and they kept my water cup filled at all times.    I did have a little sip of Moscato from my friend's bottle and it's bubbly good!    Postinos... seee ya on my next road trip... or you can open up a location in southern california =)",

Last week we had the fig and mascarpone, the warm artichoke spread, the jam and sheep's milk cheese, and the apples and brie cheese. I have had all of them and there isn't one I don't like. By far the board and bottle is the best deal around. Can't eat fast food that tastes this good, most of all I love the vibe!",

Postino's is one of those staple restaurant-wine bars in the Arcadia area that you come to enjoy casual yet delicious food, and an amazingly chic-cool atmosphere.  All the bruschetta's are delicious (my fave is the prosciutto fig), and their wine options are phenomenal.  The most fun is to come at 8pm on a Monday or Tuesday night when they have their board and bottle special ($20...a total steal!), but be prepared to wait as it can get pretty packed for that event.    They also serve brunch on the weekends, and to be able to sit out on the patio on a beautiful winters day (thank you AZ sunshine!) for a morning meal is always an amazing bonus.  If you're in the mood to get your carbs on with some bubbles or wine, definitely come and check out Postino's!!",

    "text": "Such a wonderful establishment! Great atmosphere, great food. Ever since laying my eyes on their bruschetta flights, I knew I had to come here. Service wise threw me through a loop because its a \"group effort.\" I think every waiter and waitress came to our table at some point. They were quite attentive, but it was quite a head scratchier first arriving.    I ordered a flight, as well as one a la carte. The wooden board the bruschetta comes on is so beautiful. The bruschetta was better than what I could have imagined. The bread slices are big but not unmanageable. The ingredients are fresh and full of life. The brie and apples smelled like herbal essence shampoo! The salmon capers combo one was so meaty and robust. The prosciutto cheese one was also damn good. I wish I could have ordered them all! I didnt try their french press, but the smell it produced was aroma therapy. I wanted to take a sip because of how good it smelled.   I will visit this place again, and will definitely be ordering more off of the menu.",

We came right when they opened for the day so we had the place to ourselves for a while and got awesome service. The food was absolutely amazing and way more filling than I expected. We got the cheese board to start, a couple glasses of wine, and then each choose 4 bruschettas. All of the food was amazing! We had so much food left over though that we easily could have shared an entree. We'll be back!",

The apple and brie not sound great, but it's flavors work in harmony and is delicious  Don't feel like bruschetta? Try the Butcher's Block, a Cheese Board, or The Bounty for you crudites loving fiends.  They also have paninis, soups, salads, and dessert.  To be noted, they also offer gluten-free bread for an upcharge.  Wine, beer, mimosas, and bellinis are served so have a drink while you eat.  If you're not into booze, I hear their Honey Cucumber Lemonade is refreshing.  All in all, I love Postino's.  It has become a great Tuesday night hangout spot and the Sunday brunches are worth checking out as well.",

If you don't try anything in your life...   This is a must!!! I know, I know it's toasted bread but it's not the bread it's the toppings on the bread......   I had the Brie and apples with fig spread: the Brie and fig melted in your mouth and then here comes the crunch from the apple... POW!!  Fresh Moz w/tomatoes you can't go wrong!  Smoked salmon with pesto.... Yummy  White bean with chopped tomatoes....round two please..  At first I looked at the price...$14 for Bruschetta but you get to choose up to 4 different varieties so that was great. Worth every penny!!!!!  The wine was delicious!! Before 5pm all wines on the wine list are $5 so keep them coming! (I had the Victor wine it's a red zinfandel with vanilla under tones)   I also order the mixed greens salad... Don't let the name fool you.  It's was soooooo good!   It had shaved pears, candied pecans, red grapes, Gorgonzola, leeks and mixed fresh greens...,this combo of flavor sent me on a tail spin... ( I know I'm a drama queen)   My husband had the turkey panini it was delicious but nothing to scream about.    Desserts was the creme de la creme of desserts....salted caramel sundae..... Vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate cover corn nuts and two pretzels on the side with a side of salted caramel to drizzle on top!!!! Yummy!!!!   This place has a warm and inviting atmosphere. The host was very accommodating.   Get there early!!! This place is always crowded and I see why!",

We chose four different kinds of bruschetta, the tomato jam and sheep's milk cheese, the warm artichoke dip, the green apple and fig, and the roasted red pepper and goat cheese, there's just nothing else like this in the world.  They also have great deals on wine and a half pitcher of beer. As long as it's from opening until 5 PM, most things are just five dollars. It's a fantastic deal especially for a Sunday afternoon  For our entrees, my daughter and I chose the prosciutto and fig jam panini- I had the raspberry salad as my side and my daughter had the roasted red pepper and Gouda soup. You can't even read that without your mouth watering!  The weather was gorgeous, the doors were all open. It was a gorgeous sunny Sunday in Phoenix. This will go down as a wonderful memory, and we will certainly be back the next time we're in town.",

I really like the vibe at this location. It's more mature and charming, nestled in the neighborhood, and the service is Amazing. That's right--capital A, no typo.  I generally try to avoid non-happy hour times because the way my bank account is set-up, I'm thrifty (cheap af, actually). But on this particular Zombie Jesus/April Fools Day monstrosity, the YOLO vibes were hitting hard.   The service was awesome. Just enough table touches--not so many that I felt like I was offending our server if I didn't need something, but I also didn't feel invisible. Also, I cannot ingest the best types of gluten or I turn into a pumpkin (a very sick one). I know how easy it is to miss the gluten-free note on a ticket, so it was no biggie when the bruschetta arrived on regular, very tasty-looking bread. I was just expecting a re-fire, but our server went above and beyond. This freed up the budget to purchase more wine, so I'm not sure who actually won in this situation, but I would like to think of it as a Win-Win-Win: I got delicious bruschetta and more wine, they got a devoted fan for life.   Quick Summary: Great service, delicious gluten-free options, and a beautiful atmosphere.",

If you love wine and bruschetta than this will be your own version of Heaven. Blasphemy? Then you've never been to Postino! Seriously, they have the best bruschetta you're likely to ever have in your entire life. My top four:   1) Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone 2) Brie & Apples with Fig Spread 3) Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese 4) Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes  Also worthy of mention are the amazing sandwiches. I highly recommend the Autostrada (Sopresatta, Italian ham, cappicola, mortadella, provolone, arugula and tomatoes with spicy pepper relish) and the Nine Iron (Hickory smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise). Fucking awesome.  As you'll read in most of the other reviews, Postino has a great Monday and Tuesday night special, a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board for only $20. But be warned, it'll be jam packed. Keep in mind they have two other locations as well. For you east valley residents there is a new Gilbert loction. If you are in downtown Phoenix or west valley, then the Central Avenue location a couple blocks north of Camelback will be more convenient.  With its outstanding food, decor, and ambiance, I'm going to give you a Paul V. guarantee that you will love Postino.",

Hostess moves us to the booth and then we saw the end of the bar with 5 seats open up and move again. Totally realizing we're being difficult, we apologized a bunch and the staff was cool about it. We had the special which is AMAZING! On mon tues they have a bruscetta board and any bottle of house wine for 20 bucks! 20 BUCKS! The board alone is 15. This is a fantastic deal! They also have gluten free bread which was great for Boston. We also got the Bounty which had a ton of fresh veggies (cauliflower, brussels, carrots, radishes) that were grilled and an almond hummus and some spicy almonds. Really great. Alaska got a mixed green salad with pears, grapes and crunchy leaks and a poppy seed dressing. She loved it! Two girls opted to get another glass ($9 each)but didnt realize that we could take the rest of the bottle home and the bruschetta! The bartender really went above and beyond to do this. We asked her after she brought the for the 2 glasses and she'd originally said no but made it happen eventually. My only complaint was the gf bruschetta was soft and my bread tasted a little stale and it was super loud. There really is no reason to have music up that high. Its a wine bar, where people like to hear eachother talk not a club. Its always ridiculously loud. We totally had a nice time and that bartender (thinner blond girl) was pretty cool!",

My visits have always been at night for a glass of wine and a bruchestta, which is clearly what Postino is known for! This time I enjoyed their delicious Bruschetta over lunch with Gabi M. and Lindsey F. I am amazed at how busy this place always is, but not surprised. The service was friendly and timely and that seems to be the standard any time of day.  We started with an order of the bruschetta and we each ordered entree sized salads, which was plenty of food for the 3 of us. The bruschetta is the perfect starter because of the variety and size. I am not sure if they always do this, but they cut each piece into 3 pieces, making it super easy to share and get a taste of each one! We enjoyed the Burrata and Arugula, the Prosciutto Fig & Mascarpone, the Tomato Jam & Sheep's Milk and the Brie & Apple with Fig Spread bruschetta. All of them were heavenly.  I went with the Italian Picnic salad and it was divine! )field greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette). Lindsey F. ordered the Mediterranean and Gabi M. had the mixed greens. Everything was lovely!  Postino seems to be a Phoenix classic and it definitely going on my list of Phoenix faves.   I look forward to returning to enjoy their patio over a glass of wine from their fabulous selection and a cheese board.",

We split the Bruschetta Board. My friend eats there all the time, so she picked the choices. I was 100% behind three of her choices and hugely timid to try the fourth choice -- the tomato jam. Let me say again. Oh. My. Bob. Words do not convey the splendiferously deliciousness of the tomato jam. Angels sang a chorus of hallelujah's and I'm pretty sure I had a mouthgasm on the spot. She barely got a bite before I horked the rest of it down. The rest of the food was great and the service was fantabulous but really it's all about the tomato jam for me. Tomato Jam! Tomato Jam!  Now I'm back in the desolate tomato jam-Postino lacking wasteland of a place I call home and am jonesing for a tomato jam fix!  Best friend, shmest friend, I'm going to get my butt back to Phoenix ASAP just so I can have more Postino and tomato jam!!",

At first this place kind of threw us off. It has a free valet which made us think our dirty hiking gear apparel would get us snubbed, and everything would be super expensive. I'm sure you have gathered based on the five star rating this was not the case. The gold diggers of Scottsdale were in attendance decked out in Lululemon, to class down the dress code.    To the food: We got two plates of bruschetta, and after basically licking the plate clean we got their meat and cheese butcher block plate. All the bruschetta was amazing--super flavorful and used very fresh ingredients.  We also got some wine and a mimosa, fantastic as well. One of our bruschettas was missing an end, the waitress told us that more would be out soon to make up for the missing piece. Soon afterwards, another server brought it with a little extra added, making for no complaints on our end.  I loved the ambiance. Its really cool and classy with lots of character. You can dress up or wear hiking gear. It also has garage doors to hang outside on those warm-weathered days (basically everyday in Scottsdale!). Complete with heater and misters for the summer.  Amazing all around, so chick this place out.",

Note to namers:  You could probably drop the Arcadio in the name because everything around is Aracdia this, Arcadia that.  Kind of like Florida where it is pelican or palm or sunshine whatever.  We get it.  Anyway, there was good,  live music somethere over there in the corner.  Servers were peppy and fun and informed,  The menu was largely small plates for small budgets and small appetites, which seem to fit in this hip, gentrifying neighborhood.  Organic and fresh all the way.  We had a choice of bruschetta and it was terrific.  Especially the fig and goat cheese with sauteed onion.  Decor is eclectic.  They kept the frame of the former federal post office, complete with delivery bay door framing, and put the required exposed ducts in the ceiling.  The wall next to where we sat at high topped tables was papered with a humorous, Brooklyn toile.   Parking is really limited, so expect to cruise the side streets for a space.",

My friends and I ordered a couple of bottles of prosecco  and 7 or 8 different kinds of bruschetta.  Perfect for 5 people and we had a great time talking and laughing underneath the heat lamps outside.  I loved this place and I will definitely come back every time I visit Arizona.

Strike 1: We got there, and it was a pretty packed.  I was a little astonished to pay $3 for valet.  I am not opposed to valet, but I like my options of free parking and valet.  Usually, you get your parking validated when you dine in the restaurant.    Strike 2: We had a party of 7, and majority of our party was there.  We have been waiting for 1.5 hours, and the hostess told us that it would look bad to seat us.  We were waiting more than anyone in line!  Strike 3: I asked for no cheese on my salad, and I got a buttload of cheese!  Strike 4: It felt like it was 90 degrees in there.  With the kind of money their business makes, they can keep the A/C at 80 at least!  Strike 5: The tomatoes on the bruschetta tasted kind of frozen or 2-3 days old.  I know there are a lot of great reviews, but I had a pretty bad experience.",

    "text": "Peace. Love. Drinks. Music.  What a mission statement!  And how wildly Postino succeeds!  I LOVE this place. lovelovelove.  Arrived in the afternoon prior to flying home to take advantage of the generous 11-7 happy hour with 5 dollar glasses of wine and pitchers of beer.  Was greeted by a lovely gentleman who asked if we wanted a \"proper table,\" but since we did not, he escorted us to a loungey area and seated us at two super comfy chairs with a nice table in between.  The place itself is a former historic post office; the space itself is funky and fun, with lots of natural light coming in and wonderful music!  We jammed to Bloc Party, Passion Pit, and so many other great songs.  As we sampled their libations, here were some highlights: -Bellini: so fresh and tasty and only 5 bucks! -Pinot Noir: can go so wrong, but was so right, especially for 5 bucks! -Pitcher of beer: a yummy, citrusy wheat beer; about 2 and a half glasses to these pitchers, but again, only 5 bucks! -Pub Board: yummy, warm, salted pretzel bites, excellent cheese, chorizo, and corn nuts. Great with beer. -Bruschetta: OMG so good!  One order gets you four large bruschettas (cut in half for sharing). We loved the goat cheese with roasted red peppers, brie and apple with fig spread (swoon!), white bean with tomatoes, and salami with pesto. Oh so yummy.  The service was amazing, the vibe was oh so cool, and the food and drinks were priced well and yummy.  To me, this place is like what many LA places try to be, but they actually succeed without being pretentious or overpriced. Seriously, do I need to move to Phoenix?",

I much prefer the Gilbert locale for the square footage and parking alone. The Gilbert shop is at least double the size of Arcadia, and there is wayyy more parking. Food/service/everything else wise, though, and these 2 are tied for quality.  Lunch was great today. We tried the creme brulee and it was to die for. So yum!  Really, my only complaint is the parking here. I don't like that valet is the ONLY option, especially when I can see nearby spots right in front of the restaurant. Made no sense. There's an overflow lot they directed me to about a block north.  Got to walk off some lunch that way, on the bright side. I still will not be able to let someone valet my car when I could park it myself, walk 3 steps, and then be inside the restaurant.",

The musician was talented and he played for about 2 hours. From Bob Marley, Jack Johnson, to Dire Straits. All summer type music, and all very well executed.   The place was busy so it did take a while to get food, but I was relaxed, had my sangria, and had good music so all was right in the world:) The parking could be a problem but I got lucky and was able to pull right in.

Well, I would consider it in poor taste.  I got drunk at Postino last night and had a wonderful time. The $20 Bruschetta Board and Bottle of Wine promotion they have Mondays and Tuesdays is a ridiculous steal. I didn't want to be the alcey to ask if that deal was limited to one-per-table as I was fully planning on consuming my own bottle of wine and possibly my own board of bruschetta. Luckily the guys across the bar had the same plan, so I didn't have to. FYI: It is illegal for restaurants to serve you your own bottle of wine. Don't ask how I know. I just know. However, you can split 3 or 4 with one other person and nobody says anything. Don't ask how I know this either. I just know.   All of the different bruschetta options are fantastic. The Prosciutto one tasted like Cinnamon Toast to me. That may have been the booze talking. Considering I kept referring to it as \"Cinnamon Toast Crunch\", I'm going to go ahead and say it was. The roasted red pepper & goat cheese and the apple & brie were equally delicious. Sorry, I don't have a breakfast cereal comparison for them.   To top it off, the service is fan-freaking-tastic. Everyone is extremely helpful and seems genuinely HAPPY  that you are there spending money. Clearly, from a business standpoint, this should be a given, but more often than not it isn't. Once I was there with a girl whose recently adopted Greyhound was somehow prompted to dart across the patio like a bat out of hell, knocking over chairs and wine glasses along the way. Not only was the staff RIDICULOUSLY nice about it, a few of the valet guys actually CHASED AFTER this greyhound and I'm pretty sure one of them got into his car to find it. The staff literally organized an impromptu search party for a dog that could run upwards of 60 MPH. That is some damn good service. And, we found the dog.",

    "text": "Had my second visit to Postino Winecafe the other night. Lets break it down.   The food? 5 stars - Well I've only had the bruschetta, let me tell you this, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, awesome. Trust me on this one. We also ordered the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone which is equally amazing. Don't waste your time with the White Bean with Tomatoes.   The parking? 1 Star - Why so much Valet and so little self park? I ended up hobbling (my cheap butt) down the street, two blocks, in heels to meet my friend inside. No bueno.   Regardless, I'll be back. Again and again. Great service, fun atmosphere and the best bruschetta in town.",

No fans or anything to move the air around and in this AZ heat, if you're gonna keep those garage doors open, help a sista out who's sitting on the inside.

The atmosphere is really cool - nice outdoor seating area, high tables, low tables, and a couple of booths tucked away.  The service was also very pleasant, with the waitress both attentive and friendly.  As for the food, I went for the bruschetta.  It's about $13 for four pieces, and I thought that it would be four small toast rounds.  Boy was I wrong - it's a meal in itself.  Each bruschetta is about the size of a hand and cut into four manageable strips.  I tried the tomato/mozzarella/basil (my usual standby), brie/apple/fig and ricotta/dates/pistachio.  Although I was afraid of the more \"adventurous\" ones, I wound up liking the ricotta and brie bruschetta even more than the tomato/mozzarella one, which totally held its own.  The quality of the food was great and the combinations were somewhat inventive but also worked really well together.    If I'm ever back in Phoenix I'll make sure to visit this location (or its other outpost where a buddy of mine saw the McCains).",

The Chicken and Mozzarella Panini is one of my favorites.  You can easily have a dinner for two, including an app, two entree's and a bottle of wine for well under $60.  Be aware that there WILL be about an hour wait for this quaint little restaurant. However, in the same center is a place called La Grande Orange that you can grab a decent bottle of wine at while waiting for your table. As well when you do that they validate your valet parking ($3) not including a tip.   Valet is a must usually around this spot since the parking is quite horrible.

    "text": "Postino's is my go-to carb-load-locale.  While the decor is rather industrial for my delicate Rococo sensibilities, it's always a warm environment for a rainy day--or the more frequent sunny day.  As for food, I always opt for bruschetta: great to split for a great price.  My personal favorite is the Sheep Milk and Tomato Jam.  A bite of this is like a bite of Christmas.  Try it and you'll understand.  Of course, everyone is nuts about the Pear and Brie, as well as the Proscuitto.  If your a vegetarian or keep kosher, opt for the Proscuitto without the proscuitto, as the figs and mascarpone carry boatloads of flavor and delectability on their own.  I'm also a sucker for the Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios.  The NYC Grilled Cheese is always a great choice as well--a savory treat that brings you back to childhood.  For non-wine drinkers, go for the Cucumber Honey Lemonade (and don't be intimidated by the icky sci-fi bright green color--the sweet and fresh taste is well worth it).  Of course, if you are a fine wine connoisseur or just a recreational drinker, hit up this classic Arcadia locale on Monday or Tuesday when you can get a bruschetta board and a full bottle of wine for just $20... incredible, I know.  Overall, everything at Postino's is pretty incredible, and so I highly highly recommend it.  Happy dining and wining!",

The only downfall to this place is that it's a little pricey (as in LA or SF pricey) -- a small sandwich was $10.  It was a little shocking since I was expecting PHX to be slightly cheaper than those areas.  Other than that, a great date place or a place to chill with co-workers.",

I read the reviews before going and I had high expectations, and wasn't the least disappointed.  Location and atmosphere is great, there's outside seating if you'd fancy that.  Great selection of wine list and the beer selection is surprisingly robust.  Try the Lion stout if you are into a chocolate-caramel-creamy stouts.  We tried a couple of glasses of wine, before we descended into the menu.  The real star is the brushcetta, the combinations are pretty tasty.  I loved the smoked salmon, fig/mascapone/prachuto, salami, brie/honey/apple, and smoked peppers/goat cheese.  They also have seasonal selections so don't forget to enquire.  There's a lot of stuff to check out, the panini selection is amazing as well.  Great place to hangout with friends or for a date.",

I lived in Phoenix for eight years, and Postino is one of the only places that I consistently went for anything from dates to meeting friends to dinner with my parents. Every single time (I probably went over 30 times), the service was great, the food was perfect, and the atmosphere was enjoyable.  A few tips: * If you order a panini, always get it on focaccia. Both breads are good, but the focaccia is amazing. * The tomato jam bruschetta is probably my favorite item on the menu. It's a perfect \"dessert\" bruschetta for after you finish the others. * The raspberry chicken salad is AMAZING. * There's really no way to go wrong with any of their desserts, but my favorite was the vanilla creme brulee.  Honestly, I really hope I can find a place as amazing as Postino where I'm living now, but it's going to be tough to beat.",

I can't complain about lingering in La Grande Orange while waiting for our table.  I was in a party of 3, probably took us an hour to get a table as we chose not to sit at the bar, ended up with cozy seating outside on the patio, where the tables seem perfectly spaced from each other, and the twinkly lights seemed almost magical. We ordered glasses of wine, then settled on a bottle of Tempranillo (wow!) to accompany our respective bruschetta boards. ADORED the mascarpone-fig-proscuitto (first experience with that combo) and spicy white bean hummus. I liked the fresh mozzarella-tomato-basil just okay, thought the hearty chewiness of the bread was a bit much for the delicate toppings.  Try to walk if you can- parking is a nightmare.   LOVE IT!",

    "text": "I've experienced Postino two different ways in the past two weeks: a late night visit for tea and sparkling wine and a few days later to grab pick up for my boss and myself.   The first visit was a nice intro, I like the location, tucked in on Campbell, and the interior design is cozy (fab chandelier!). The retail wine area at the entrance is awkward to me, because it's cramped and I frankly think you should all be buying wine at my shop so perhaps I'm a touch biased. Anyway, it is a great way for you to take home whatever you enjoyed with your dinner. Damn magnanimity.   I wasn't in the mood for drunk biking that night so I skipped the adult beverages for a pot of tea. I get that this is a wine cafe so really no one going here is going to review a cup of tea, except for me. Tea selection was sad. Tea has the same cult following that wine does, so three options seemed half-hearted. And my pot of hot water was only half filled, which, for $2.50 is lame.  Okay I'm done bashing PW.   The second time I drove in for a take out order of the bruschetta board. My order was ready, the place was packed and I was able to get in and out in less than 3 mins! We ordered the date and pistachio on ricotta, the fig and prosciutto, the mozz/tomato/basil and the smoked salmon pesto. Great value to order ratio, each slice was huge and pre-chopped into littler bites. The smoked salmon was definitely my favorite, with the runner up being the pistachio/date combo. The MTB was a little dry for me and I don't eat prosciutto so that was for my boss.  I love that they have neighborhood night deals and that you can friend them on facebook and get a special word of the day to get $5 glasses of wine no matter what time of night!",

Don't get me wrong, I like this place, and I oblige them every time they want to go, but I think 4 stars is just right for the rating.   We went there this weekend, and the typical scenario went down. Parking was cramped (lucked out to get a \"valet\" spot which I parked into myself as it was right out front by the entrance - no I'm not waiting for you Mr. Valet Dude to get into my car and pull it forward into the spot right in front of my face, thank you very much), and there was a short wait (maybe 10-15 minutes). We sat outside, which wasn't ideal since it was cold and drizzly, but we had patio heaters on both sides of our table so it was OK.   Sadly we didn't make their $5 wine special, which ends at 5pm, so we were paying full price for the glasses of wine - ranging from $8 to about $12-13. I don't know about you, but I really am not a fan of paying $10 for a glass of wine when I can pay that for an entire bottle. But alas, I had 2 different wines through the course of the night, both on recommendation from the servers, and both decent.   We ordered the infamous bruschetta, with the 4 choices being: smoked salmon (YUM!), warm artichoke (tasty), roasted red pepper (still good), and white bean with tomato (OK, but nothing to write home about).   For dinner, I had the half & half combo (where you get to choose 2 different items), and I chose the mixed green salad (REALLY delicious, with an awesome combination of greens, pears, grapes, gorgonzola cheese, pecans, & poppyseed dressing) and half of a turkey/pesto pannini. The pannini was QUITE boring. Didn't have much flavor at all. I think it was lacking on the pesto.   And honestly, this is what I come to expect at Postino. Some things are just unbelievable and you want to lick your plate clean, and other things are simply boring and tasteless (like the white bean/tomato bruschetta and the turkey/pesto pannini).   And hence my rating of 4 stars rather than 5. If the parking was easier, the wines were always $5 a glass, and the food was consistent, I would give it 5 stars. Fair enough?  :)",

The one thing I have to say about Postino is that the bruschetta is a must have. Most places give you a little piece or two for each of your selections, Postino gives you a whole large slice of bread for each choice that's sliced into four good size pieces. It was way more than we expected and both my date and I felt a little full going into the main course just from that.  Speaking of the main course, I had a panini type sandwhich with chicken, tomato and mozzarella that I really enjoyed.   The atmosphere and service is perfect for a date. Quite enough to talk, you get enough attention but not so much that it interrupts your night and the lighting, outdoor seating and ambiance is just right.  Oh and that beer? Loved it too.",

We sat inside but they had the \"wall\" open so it's was kinda indoor/outdoor which added to the nice atmosphere of the place.  They had $5 drinks so we all indulged (it was Friday after all). I had a mimosa that was made with freshly squeezed orange juice. Very tasty. For lunch I ordered a half prosciutto and brie sandwich and half mixed greens salad. Both were delicious. The sandwich came on ciabatta bread that was nice and fresh. It included several slices of prosciutto, a nice thick slice of brie, arugula and fig spread. At it was served toasted. The fig gave a nice sweet compliment to the salty prosciutto and the brie gave it a nice warm gooeyness. The salad was mixed greens with grapes, pear, and candied walnuts with a light vinaigrette dressing. I love fruity salads and this one did not disappoint. Everything was very fresh and the dressing was flavorful.  They also offer a good variety of bruschetta so it would make a great place for happy hour if you just wanted a drink and a little bite to snack on.  One minus - parking sucks. We did the valet, which is free but you know you gotta tip so it's not really free.",

Food: Brushcetta- We sampled the artichoke, pesto with salmon, roasted red peppers with goat cheese, and the fig spread with green apple.  I mean all of them were decent nothing was amazing.  In fact, i think I could easily put together a couple of them myself and have them taste just as good if not better.  Nine Iron-  Once again, it was OK.  Nothing special at all.  Just exactly as was described on the menu.  Italian Picnic Salad-  Once again, nothing special at all.  Could have made it myself.  Service: So on vacation we tend to eat out.  This was our 4th dinner out in a row and the first 3 had impeccable service.  This place did not.  I felt like it was a lot of waiting and waiting more.   We ordered something they did not bring and when we asked for that something we waited and waited....  Servers were nice enough though but they didn't seem that busy on a Sunday night so I would have expected service to be better.  Ambiance: Servers-Well, the servers I would classify as Arizona hipsterish.  Like not real hipsters.  They should go to SF to see those.  But definitely trying to be hipsters  People there- 30- somethings at birthday dinners mixed with 20-somethings on date.  And yes, we did witness a couple making out.  Once again this was 7pm on a Sunday. Spare me please.  The Place- First, we asked to sit inside because it was slightly cold.  Well they sit us inside but right next to the open half of the restaurant so it basically was sitting outside but without the heater.  Other than that it was cute inside.  Maybe this place was more like 2 1/2 -3 but I was so disappointed with the food and ambiance that I have to round down to 2.  This place is probably great during happy hour but when you're paying full price, it's just so not worth it.",

    "text": "Happy Hour Review  It's always fun trying out a happy hour in a new city - we know that happy hour is happy hour anywhere, from New Zealand to Memphis. So, when I set out for Phoenix to spend some quality time with family, my one goal for the low-key weekend was to hit up a local happy hour.  My great-aunt had heard good things about Postino's and Yelp confirmed it was a solid happy hour bet - coming up 2nd in the search queue. So great-aunt & grandmother in tow, I headed for Postino (quaintly named as the location formerly housed a post office!) for their Sunday afternoon reggae and white sangria. I first noted the full parking lot, which I came to find out later - has discouraged some other relatives from visiting Postino. But for an LA-kid, the fact that free nearby lots and street parking was available - well, ain't that a novel concept?  I also noted was that we did have to add our names to a waiting list; happy hour is not at the bar, per se, it's to be ordered from your seats. So we bopped around the adjacent La Grande Orange shop to bide our time - it also seemed like a good time with good food (albeit loud & busy). Thankfully, our wait was short and we were sat outside, which was fine in the 95 degree temperature - almost everywhere seems to have nice shading and misters.  My gang of three forwent the $5 wine and beer deals and instead opted for the Sunday special - $5 white wine sangria. I quite enjoyed mine, but my HH partners thought it a bit sour and added splenda. There are no food deals on the happy hour menu, but the prices are not too wallet-depleting. I got the  1/2 Italian Market Salad (greens tossed with roasted beets, goat cheese, bacon (no bacon for me!) and walnuts topped with crisped root vegetables in herb vinaigrette) and  1/2 vegetarian sandwich (grilled Asparagus, roasted artichokes, red onion, vine ripe tomatoes, goat cheese, and house-made pesto) for $9.50 and a cup of the Brocolli-cheddar soup for $2.50.   I didn't leave any room for the bruschetta, but it sounded great - you pick four options of toppings (including brie & apples with fig spread; smoked salmon or salami with pesto; white bean with chopped tomato; ricotta with dates & pistachios, and more) for $12.75.  The crowd was pretty homogenous - youngish professionals on family time listening to the one-man reggae band. I think it'd be a great spot to catch up with a girlfriend over the weekend. And I'd love to see what kind of crowd the early evening/evening brings. To me, it seems weeknights would be optimal for a date night.  I also wonder about the 11-5 happy hour, which is great for the weekend, but I wonder who can partake on weekdays...",

I came solo and had a leisurely lunch where I wanted to order both a selection of bruschetta and half-sandwich and salad combo, but upon the waiter's recommendation I just sampled one of the bruschetta - the warm artichoke spread, which was incredible, though I gotta admit it didn't come out that warm.  It tasted like it had been sitting in the kitchen for a while before waitstaff had gotten around to picking it up and delivering it to me. Ultimately it came out kind of cold, but it was still incredibly good, so I can't complain too much (except I can because I'm Korean like that and prefer it when my food is hot off the fire hot and my drinks are icy cold).  I also had a glass of white wine which was completely forgettable, Hannah's field salad, and 1/2 Tuscan Tuna Sandwich.  I don't typically go for tuna sandwiches, but it sounded perfect, and the pickles and the mustard added just the right hint of piquancy.  The salad was nice too, though a little sweet for my tastes; all in all, it paired nicely with the tuna sandwich.  I love the kale and quinoa combo.    This is a fun place to come with friends, so that you can share all of the different types of bruschetta.  If I came back and didn't order anything but a few different bruschetta, I wouldn't feel like I missed out. :)",

My favorites would have to be the Smoked Salmon and Pesto, Apple and Brie, Prosciutto and Fig and Warm Artichoke.  Plus, you cannot beat a bottle of vino and 4 types of bruschetta for $20 every Monday and Tuesday after 8pm!  I am also a huge fan of their Pretzel Pub Board and NYC Grilled Cheese that is companied by a Sierra Nevada Mustard, Pesto and Ketchup dipping sauces, washed down with a cold Stella Artois Lager Belgium.  These menu items have sparked inspiration for me to make similar dishes in my own kitchen more than a time or two.  So grab some good company, a bottle of vino paired with bruschetta and prepare for a relaxing-enjoyable night out.  Don't forget the Affogato (vanilla bean ice cream topped with espresso) to give ya a jolt for your car ride home.",

I especially loved the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes bruschetta (of course, you can never go wrong with BURRATA!).

They were literally playing Screamo music at 2pm on a Wednesday afternoon at the loudest it could be. We searched areas of the restaurant where it wasn't so loud but they have speakers everywhere. We asked them to turn it down but they said they couldn't. There were about 10 other patrons and none of them were under 40 years of age. I simply don't understand their music issue.  Everything else is fantastic. Sorry I have to leave a poor review.",

    "text": "So my coworker and I hit up this place a few weeks ago to vent about work and unwind over a bottle of red and both have been itching to go back very soon. I have known about their board and bottle deal for quite some time and just have never had the opportunity to go try it. Essentially you pick a board of bruschetta (pick 4 out of their menu) and a bottle of wine for 20 bucks. We both couldn't get enough of any of the 4 we picked. Service was friendly and adequate. The first girl who attended to us did forget to mention that the deal does not begin until 8pm so we told her that's what we were interested in, she said \"oh we got some time\" and walked away. My coworker and I interpreted that as in oh we didn't miss the deal yet, it's still active for some time. Luckily a different girl showed up to our table minutes and explained. No biggie, we ordered an app to share and munch on in the meantime. The ambiance is nice and casual, but still classy enough so that it puts you into that wine drinking mood xD. Dark yet lit up just enough, I can definitely see many people having dates here.",

The menu has a great selection of sandwiches, bruschetta platters and wine. Although the wine selection varies between different postino restaurants, they have amazing deals on specific days of the week. I would definitely recommend this restaurant for a relaxed evening dinner with friends and family.",

    "text": "Seriously one of the best restaurants I've gone to on my trip to Phoenix! We can during happy hour and our wait ended up being around 45 minutes, but well worth it! Two happy hour times, and on Mondays/Tuesday's (when we went) the late happy hour starts at about 8PM.  Parking is hard to come by during peak times; luckily someone pulled out not too long after we got there. Parking spot right in front of the entrance.   When we were eventually seated - we ordered their happy hour special - bruschetta board. It's a $15 board of four types of bruschetta -- you're choice of a variety of flavors and combinations. With it being happy hour - you get the full board plus $5 for an entire bottle of wine!! By the time we left we got 2 boards and 2 bottles of wine. Since we didn't even finish the first one, you can easily take home your open and unopened bottles! They even package it in a cute paper bag.  Our bruschetta board (the flavors we choose) were: First board - Brie and apples with a fig spread, prosciutto with fig and marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto, ricotta with dates and pistachios. This flavors were to die for! There's definitely something about a cheese and fruits combination. My favorites - Brie and apples and the ricotta with dates and pistachios. Second board -- Brie and apples again, fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil, burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomatoes, and their seasonal flavor which was a type of specialty ham and a lemon herb ricotta. By the way, their bread is gluten free!  The bruschetta board is a definite must, and if you're also looking for something fancy - try the butchers block. We also enjoyed this assortment of artisan meats and cheeses served with smoked almond hummus, olives, asparagus, nuts, and crostinis.  My meal was accompanied by a refreshing cucumber honey lemonade. I cannot fathom enough how much I enjoyed this restaurant and wine bar! It's perfect for a date night or just a girls night out. Outside seating just as beautiful like inside. A must try!",

He was spectacular and on-point with everything. Then when my friend told him it was still part of my birthday celebration, he brought out a chocolate cake with ice cream and a candle -- and sang to me. (At my request, at the TOP of his lungs so the whole restaurant knew it was my birthday. Lol.) THANK YOU, STEFAN!!! :) Oh, and to top it off, I got a kiss on the cheek... super sweet.

My friend ordered the bruschetta and I ordered the cheese plate to start, or so we thought. They brought out a bountiful display that was more than enough for dinner and we did not need to order anything more. The bruschetta portions were much bigger than what I'm used to. Each one was basically an open faced sandwich. I can't stand when a cheese plate comes out with barely two bites of each cheese. Thankfully, that is not Postino's style. Their s*** was on point, to put it bluntly.   Had I not been in town for business I probably would have cracked another bottle and hung out long enough to be hungry for more dishes. Next time!",

I arrived later than my group but was quickly brought water and asked about a drink order. Our server was attentive and promptly took our group's food order and checked in on how our food was.

I was really excited once I saw all the differenct varieties of bruschetta we could choose from.

I had the Ranga Ranga Sauvignon Blanc from New Zealand which was nicely chilled, crisp, light and a refreshing choice for sipping outside on the patio on a beautiful sunny day.     We chose the cheese board which was not the best I've ever had (although in all fairness I am a cheese snob!!) but definately good and I enjoyed the presentation and the different selection of breads served with it. We also ordered the bruschetta. It was hard narrowing it down to just four as I wanted to try them all. We settled on the following:  Roasted red peppers & goat cheese - My least favorite of the 4. It was good but I would have preferred more goat cheese and less peppers Fresh mozzarella w/ tomato & basil - Chewy bread, fresh tomatoes, ample basil, yum!  Smoked salmon w/ pesto & capers - Salmon was fresh, lots of capers, another yum! Tomato jam & fresh sheeps milk - my absolute favorite! I had to remind myself to share.   An overall great experience.  I can't wait to return so I can try the rest of the bruschettas!",

Highly recommend getting a reservation because it's always packed on Tuesdays.  The service is great, though sometimes, if they are having a bad day, they tend to complain about how busy they are.

I've yet to order anything else because I simply can't imagine a visit without it!!   Ambience- reason enough to come back as often as socially acceptable. The industrial rustic interior is full of character and all in all just a wonderful place to be!",

I always order the sweet tomato jam and sheep's milk, ricotta and dates, apples and brie, and salmon/pesto. Consistently great food & drinks. Service has more spunk and personality at this Postino location too. Try the cucumber lemonade if you don't like wine or just plain water. If you order wine and it isn't happy hour, you can easily spend more than $30 on yourself. However, I think it is worth it, and I always leave full and happy. Thanks Postino!",

You can't go wrong with a brushetta board and a bottle of wine, which is $20 Mon and Tues after 8. The staff was so friendly and the vibe was relaxed. I just love coming here to unwind from the work week. For chilly nights, bring a jacket as it's a somewhat open restaurant. And yeah, parking really blows.

    "text": "I'd been hearing about Postinos from some food snob friends of mine so I decided to try it out this past Friday night.  Got there at 7 p.m. and scored a table with no wait in the middle of the dining room.  Immediately I realized it was a little too loud for the audience with the music playing, but stuck it out.  I was meeting my friend's parents who were in town on vacation and thought it would be a nice, casual place with hopefully great wine and food.  They loved the architecture inside, with the exposed pipes and brick and large, open garage doors.  The patio was probably not quite as loud, but was full so we were definitely stuck inside.    I had a glass of $11 Malbec, which was fantastic.  We ordered the bruschetta and I im in love with the artichoke version as well as the apple and brie.  I was not blown away by the mozzerella and tomato, which I thought I had heard was a guaranteed good time.  I also got the turkey panini though which I got with a salad.  It was bigger than any panini I've ever had and I took half of it home.  It had  a pesto sauce that made it the best panini I think I've had in my lifetime.  (Maybe I've had ten paninis though in my lifetime so take it for what it's worth.)  The salad I was not blown away by and was not disappointed when the waiter took it away while asking if he could take it away.  Service was a little slow, but again it was a Friday night.  The wait staff is a friendly, helpful group and didn't rush us as we sat and chatted while eating for three hours.    Valet is $3, which is fair, but what is a riot is when you walk out, if you had your keys, you could walk the twenty feet and get your car yourself.  But instead, you have to wait behind five people for the valet to hand you your keys and THEN you walk to your car.  AFTER tipping of course:)  Overall, I will go back for the paninis, maybe try a few other bruschettas.  It will be hard to not to to LGO next door though...",

The converted post office has terrible acoustics and it gets REALLY loud in there. Unless you know someone really well, you might feel a little awkward yelling at them, or saying 'What?!' after everything they say. And, while the brushettas are AMAZINGLY delicious - i swear by the prosciutto, it is to die for - it is definitely not pretty to eat; capers flying across the table and gnawing through the crunchy bread like a rabid dog.  but, i love going there with good friends and my boyfriend. the servers aren't snobs and they will help you pick a bottle even if you just tell them, 'uh, i like red, yeah, red wine is awesome' without rolling their eyes. the crowd can look very scottsdale, but the attitude is not, so don't get discouraged when you walk in a see business men in suits and lots of tan legs and blonde hair. the menu is just appetizers, but i guess you can order pizzas from La Grande Orange (please don't call it 'LGO,' that's lame) which is right across the parking lot and owned by the DeMarcos as well. I've never had it but it comes highly recommended. oh! and they waive corking fees on monday nights, but other than that, i don't think they many specials- too bad.",

The only thing that tends to be lacking is the service, but only in speed. I'd say they need a few extra hands but that would just add more bodies to an already packed house ( I have never seen this place slow) so I'm perfectly content sitting back and waiting.

We weren't sure what to expect - we showed up early (around 6:45) on a Saturday, and the place was wide open - but we just beat the rush.  By 7:30, it was packed, but we were fine.   Service was great, and with one Vegan and four cautious stomachs in the group, our only regret was that we couldn't eat more!  The salads are extraordinarily good, and the panini's were fresh and flavorful - the fresh cheeses are really, really good.   We liked it so much, we went back on Monday before our flight left for Chicago.  Great atmosphere, good menu selections, good salads, and we only wish we had more time to drink....",

I am salivating just thinking about the bruschetta -- all different varieties for different pallettes.  mmm...  The paninis look delicious, too, but I haven't tried them yet b/c I always end up with the delicious bruschetta.  I normally have a hard time pairing it down to just four choices of bruschetta.  The vibe of this place is loungy and comfortable, which is nice.  And on a nice day, the doors/windows are open, so there is a very airy feeling to the place.  My only complaint is how small the tables are and how squooshed together everyone is.  But, if you are with a good crowd, you won't even notice.",

The garage door concept works well to blend the outdoor and indoor seamlessly.  The table set up is pretty roomy for a winebar.  The good stops there.  The bread on one of the bruschetta was SO hard that it chafed the skin off the roof of my mouth.  Bruschetta with epidermis?  I don't think so!  Now what really killed it for me was how limited the wine selection was (by the glass that is).  You only had 1 choice for each type...WHAT?!?!  Hello...did I not just see the name \"winecafe\" in its name?  I was really disappointed and the servers DEFINITELY don't have a clue about the wines.  I asked for a recommendation on a cab and she asked me if I wanted red or white.  Yeah...'nuff said.",

Everyone who works there is really sweet and one of the older bartenders is great to talk with.  I used to stop by so often the bartender would take a few glasses of wine off the bill.  Whenever people come in from out of town I have to take them here.  They have the best bruschetta!

    "text": "Went there with friend for a late lunch.  It was very busy for a Sat. afternoon.  People were very friendly and we spent the 30 min wait at the bar with a couple of glasses of wine.  The bartender was very much on top of it.  We ordered three appetizers: Cheese plate, olives and tomato+ mozzarella.   All was very good.  The prices didn't make sense though.  I think the cheese plate was a fantastic value considering what you get.  But the tomato and cheese version was prob. not worth the money.  The bowl of Olives is what it is.  I liked it, my friend wanted some salty olives in there too which was all oil cured olives.  I am a fan and will go.  Just a side note; it seems that you have to have many visible tattoos to work here, so if you don't want your wait staff to be very casual and with lots of piercing etc. be warned.  Also, we saw a person who must have been a mgr scold a couple of the staff in front of everyone which I thought was not necessary.  Mainly because they weren't doing anything wrong secondly I am sure this could have been done in the back of the house.  Overall, nice atmosphere and loved the garage door open walls which gave the open air feel.  I liked how the bartenders were on top of it even though they were busy.  Our tap for the three apps and 4 glasses of wine was $50 plus a $10 tip makes it not a cheap place to just chill in the afternoon but I will be back prob. later in the evening for a happy hour or something.",

    "text": "I try to like you Postinos, I really do but you make it so hard.  Came on a Tuesday for their 8 PM $20 Bottle of wine and bruschetta special and left disappointed and annoyed.  The parking lot disaster strikes again!  LGO now put up signs saying 25 min parking for LGO customers only and has a lot monkey stationed to chase away people trying to park in those spaces.  I was told by the lot monkey that I could valet ($3 charge) or I could park 3 blocks away if I didn't want to pay the fee.  Keep in mind this is a Tuesday and I have to pay to park my car because the restaurant blocks off all the spaces.  Once seated my friend and I tried to catch up for a moment when the server came over to take our drink orders.  Since we had just sat down we asked for some time to take a look at the menu.  Our server came back a few minutes later and asked if we were ready to order.  No suggestions on a wine, no questions if we had questions, just \"you ready to order?\"  We ordered a bottle and bruschetta and our waiter disappeared.  For the rest of the night.  I watched him refill wine glasses at other tables, ours was brought by another server.  Other tables had their plates cleared when they were finished, ours sat in front of us until another server took them away.  Our server obviously didn't want our business because about an hour after we sat down he came back to the table and asked if we were interested in any dessert.  We said no and he immediately dropped the check on the table and left.  No offer of another round of drinks, just here is your check.  The wine we had was amazing and was a steal at the price plus the bruschetta.  The bruschetta themselves were half assed.  3 of the 4 weren't even sliced all the way through but over all they were decent.  Yet again Postinos shows they want my money but not my patronage.  I don't understand how I am the only one who keeps having horrible experiences here?",

Well, while it was okay, I will not say it met my expectations and I will tell you why. Big plus\" Live music. Another big plus: Expanded beer selection including domestic beers in bottles. The food just was not up to par with Central. The Cranberry Walnut Chicken Salad, our old fave, lacked Gorgonzola and had WAY too much celery. too little chicken and too may herbs. The apples in it were the size of a gold ball (OK, I am exaggerating, but not much). It lacked finesse. I know the weekend chef may have been new, not skilled, whatever but come on, this is a nice place. We had a Panini which also lagged far behind the Central location. Lacked flavor and the pepper spread was not as spicy. The salad we ordered had almost no dressing on it, which I know is an easy fix, but COME ON this is not a young place...upscale crowd and decor. Great wait staff. They were not the problem. The beer was not the problem. But they should take their kitchen staff over to Postino Central for some training.",

The only friend I have that LOOOOOOVVVVEEEEESSS (you get the point)  this retaurant is currently filing for bankruptcy.  Hmmmm.  I brought a gentleman friend here, we sat on the patio, and ordered bruschetta and drinks. The wine was corky and very acidic, and two of the bruschetta were not pleasurable.  Then the mosquitoes arrived.  Hoards.  A military platoon of mosquitoes on a mission to EAT US ALIVE.  I talked to the server about the problem and she might as well have been a stuffed dress dummy for all the help she was--she didn't even offer to move us inside.  Wayyyyy too much moola handed over for less than stellar service and very 3 star food.  Second visit was a daytime weekend for wine and nibbles.  I tried several wines, only one was good.  I don't think they store it properly.   Becketts Table is the place to go for a good glass of wine.  Again, a very high bill for a low satisfaction quotent.",

I think the service is better at lunch, probably because they are less busy. Either way, the wine selection and food are great. I agree with other reviewers that the $20, Monday & Tuesday nights, after 8pm deal is awesome! You get 4 bruschetta & and a bottle of wine for only $20! The vibe of this place at night is neat. It's dark, & dimly lite with tea light candles. There are a few comfortable sofas, high top tables, regular tables, and a great patio outside. It has a very intimate feel and would be a great place for a date. It does get very busy & crowded in the evening so keep that in mind. There is usually a wait on Mondays & Tuesdays after 8pm. Service gets a little slow during their busy times. My favorite bruschetta is Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. It is very sweet! If you're desiring a salad the Raspberry Chicken salad is great. Very flavorful! I also really like the Turkey Panini, very tasty! The only bad thing I can say about this place is the parking is awful! More often than not, you'll end up having to valet your car because there is very little parking.",

This entire corner is now owned by an enterprising young couple who ingeniously converted the old post office to a wine bar featuring fresh aperitifs and lite gourmet pizza!  They did such a fab job on the remodel they were written up in Architects Digest some 8 years ago (or more) when they opened.  It's become something of a low key meeting hub with \"great date\" written all over the place.  Any given night of the week you will find this place a' buzz!  So plan on a wait, unless it's early in the evening or very early in the week - like Monday.  Open for lunch and open late; again with some candied confections that could make a girl on a diet cry.  Look cute, because this is where the beautiful people hang out in Phoenix, sans attitude.  Moderately priced.",

I had raved about it to a friend and we decided to go for lunch on a Saturday with the knowledge that it would be packed and we would have a wait before sitting down, and we were okay with that since we kept busy by walking through La Grande Orange.   Finally, we sit down, in a \"quieter\" part of the restaurant, near a small table on upholstered chairs. Sidenote: I'm a germophobe so it drove me crazy how much those chairs needed to be cleaned. But anyways... We order our food from a different server than our first one because she never came back after drinks. We got our food in a timely fashion, ate hungrily and it was totally worth the wait. As we walked in, we saw two ladies order dessert and both my friend and i decided it was necessary we try their salted caramel sundae. So when we finished our salads and panini's, we waited. and waited. and waited. no one checked up on us. which is okay, i guess. but that place isn't that big, even for three or four servers tops, so being busy isn't an excuse for me (I work in a restaurant, so i'm very sympathetic to servers, but some things just don't make sense to me). finally, our second server comes back..... with the check. and she left again before we could explain we wanted dessert and separate checks. it took at least ten minutes to flag her down again and she seemed a bit salty after that. In hindsight, I shouldn't have tipped as well as i did. It was more for pity than for being appreciative of her service.  So despite the disappointing service, the food is still superb. and that sundae? Never had a better one, even at the Sugar Bowl.",

Our waiter really knew a lot about the menu and seemed really excited to have us there.   My biggest gripe was the lack of AC. We arrived at 8pm and at one point I started feeling sick because there was no air circulation indoors and outdoors the misters were hardly having any effect. The place was packed and we had to wait an hour for our table. So, standing in a packed restaurant with no AC and no fans was miserable. We almost left, but because it cleared out quite a bit by 9, I was willing to give it a try.   I will never come back there during their weekend dinner rush and probably will not be back during the summer. Otherwise, it is a great restaurant.",

The patio makes you forget that you are in the middle of the desert, the waitstaff is friendly, knowledgeable and fun, and the food...wow. The bruschetta goes unmatched in the Valley and pretty much any other place I've visited. It's so good that I don't bother to order it anywhere else. Nothing compares. The chicken and mozzarella panini has quickly become my favorite sandwich in town. I sub the pesto in for the mayo, and I can't think of anything I'd rather have for lunch. The downfall is the parking situation, but with a little patience or a few dollars for the valet, you'll be seated and enjoying a delicious meal in no time. Whether it's soup inside on a rainy day or a life-changing sandwich on the patio in the springtime, Postino never disappoints.",

At least 10 combos of amazing bruschetta options including ingredients like salmon, goat cheese, dates, bacon, arugula, fresh tomato... The goddamn WORKS. You choose 4 bruschetta combos for your board.  Bottle: a wide variety of their otherwise pricey(ish) wine bottles.   AMAZING!! you will wait on Mondays and Tuesdays, but it is always totally worth it! $20 for a quality board and amazing bottle? YES.  Furthermore, other nights of the week also rock as this place has amazing brews and beer/wine. Cheers, Phoenix!",

    "text": "Looking for a place that fuels your desire for wine & bruschetta...small plates and great ambiance? Then this is the place for you.   If you are looking to chow down on heavy protein based meal...then I suggest you split a board of bruschetta and then head to dinner right after (at least that is what I did).   I had an interesting experience here..and luckily they redeemed themselves at the end, which I genuinely appreciated.   Being from out of town and hearing the best things about Postino, I bookmarked it immediately as I love small tapas type of venues.   Postino has a nice selection of wines, beers, paninis, meats & cheese , and they are best known for their bruschetta boards (they come in 4).  -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  LOCATION - Small parking lot, but the complimentary valet really made up for it. The gentleman doing the valet were prompt and really nice. Don't forget to bring a couple bucks if you are planning to valet to tip these young gentlemen.   SERVICE - They redeemed themselves in the end. The hostess quickly sat us which I appreciated. They work as a team here, therefore though you have one main server, you also have other servers bringing out your food, refilling your water, etc. Our waters were poured on point, as soon as it got down.   The only flaw I noticed, and I won't name names out of the respect of the gentleman that served us because he was really nice... was that I wished he checked up on us more frequently in the beginning. After we got our drinks we ordered which came fast, he did not came back to our table for quite a while. When he finally did, he took a couple's order next to us, took our order, then also took the order of another table near us (whom sat at least 10 minutes after us). I also watched him clean off a table, answer some questions from other tables, before finally entering our order in. No big deal... until the food from everyone came out..couples ordered multiple items while we only ordered one bruschetta board. I figured I should just be patient, did not even bother him when he walked through us a few times, but when I saw a couple get their food when we had ordered 20 minutes prior..that's when I had to flag our server down. I asked him if our food was coming out anytime soon, since it felt like a while and many others had their food prior to us. He said that it definitely should have been out by now and went to check on it. About 6-7 minutes later, he came back out with the food, apologized and said that the order was put in but the kitchen did not have the order. No idea what happened, but what I am guessing is that the kitchen saw our soup order and then threw out our ticket thinking it was done. Nevertheless, the manager did come up to us later and apologized and comped us the bruschetta, which again, I appreciated. However, my excitement and patience had already died down so unfortunately I did not enjoy the meal as much as I wanted to. I only wished our server was more aware of the situation without me having to announce it. I do believe each sever had a large amount of tables, so that may have contributed to the less attentiveness to each table.   FOOD - Got the \"soup of the moment\" which was absolutely delicious. It was a potato, artichoke and turkey cream soup. Ordered the bowl ($6) which was perfect for sharing.   Also ordered the bruschetta board (comes with 4 of your choice of the following):   Brie & Apples with Fig Spread Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone Warm Artichoke Spread Smoked Salmon with Pesto Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios White Bean with Chopped Tomato Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese Salami with Pesto Seasonal  I tried the following, and each bruschetta was cut cleanly into 4's which was great for picking up, and for sharing.   Brie & Apples with Fig Special- apples were thinly cut and the brie was nicely put on. Probably my favorite one. The flavors of the fig and apple went well together.  Burrato, Bacon Arugula and Tomato- Really tasty, and savory. A little salty, but it's the bacon   Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios - not sure if the spreading of the cheese was just rushed since our board came out less than 7 minutes when they realized our order was lost, but the amount of ricotta on this bruschetta was not tasteable...very thin, so much so that I could see the bread underneath. I enjoyed the pistachios. This is a really simple bruschetta.   Roasted Red Peppers with Goat Cheese - Nice roasted flavors on the peppers and goat cheese was nicely spread.   Also ordered the Bellini, which was Prosecco + fresh squeezed nectar. Very tasty and a bit stronger than I imagined! This is served all day, everyday for just $5. Go for it!   I am giving them a 4 stars, instead of 5",

Bruschetta is always on point and the only time I ever come to Postinos is for the $20 board and bottle night on Monday and Tuesday. The upside of this location is that there's a parking lot and the wait was only about 20 min, versus the Tempe and Scottsdale locations which had about 1-1.5 hr wait times. I split the board with my friend and we got the Brie and Apple with fig, prosciutto with figs and marscapone, smoked salmon with pesto, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, with tomato. Out of all of them the pesto salmon is always one of my go tos but the burrata, bacon, arugula with tomato was definitely my favorite! I would probably not order the prosciutto with figs and marscapone but my friend liked it! I think I tend to just prefer the stronger flavors. Overall I always have to recommend Postinos for board and bottle night but it took us about 40 minutes for us to get our check and pay!",

I like sweet things. :) Its was really dark and loud though, so after eating we walked next door to the La Grande Orange Grocery and Pizzeria. They have gelato there. It is super crowded inside, since it is also a shop, but out front they have picnic tables, and we hung out there for an hour longer.

I am a sucker for any dish that successfully combines sweet & savory!  Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil is delicious as well as the ricotta with dates & pistachios.   I also LOVE their NY grilled cheese and the mustard, ketchup and pesto sauces they provide you with for dipping. So yummy!  Parking at this location is somewhat of a PITA but that's typical Arcadia. The restaurant itself always has a great vibe and good service. I would likely give another star if their brunch options were just a bit more robust. The farm scramble is very tasty, but not having omlettes, pancakes, OR waffles on the menu is a serious FAIL.",

    "text": "Hubby and I have gone to Postino for years...first at the Arcadia location and now Central.  We enjoy Central's patio more, so we head there.  With either location, we've always asked ourselves, \"why didn't we think about opening a restaurant that just puts tasty things on bread and charge well for it?\"  let's face it...what Postino does is not rocket science.  Great composed salads, wonderful panini and bruschetta. but, there's no hard cooking.  What there is though is creativity, style and great service.   on our last visit, we headed to Postino Central on a Wednesday night, thinking that since it was the day before St. Patrick's, no one would be out.  well, we were wrong. first, we were turned away by the valet -- \"sorry, we're full.\"  The parking lot?  the restaurant?  Where should we go?  any tips?  so, i got on the phone and called the restaurant -- \"Your valet just turned us away, are you looking for customers tonight?\"  He was cordial and stated he would go chat with the valet about finding a better way to turn down folks who needed to park their cars.    hostess was very friendly and accommodating...giving us every option for seating.  but, given the spectacular night that it was, we wanted to wait for an outdoor table.  so, we ordered some beers with the very friendly waitress that happened by, and sat in the outdoor \"waiting area\" watching the sunset.  about 1/2 hour later, we got a prime table -- in fact the same table we eat at each time we are there.   same waitress came by.  hubby ordered a second beer (i was still nursing the \"shorty\" (only $2.50!) I'd ordered before.  We selected the bella postino platter with white bean hummus and warm artichoke dip, as well as a bruschetta board of four luscious creations.  \"bus boy\" brought water and small dish of olives (okay, really small -- there were two of us and he brought 3 olives -- not 2, not 4, but 3 --yes, we arm-wrestled for the last one.)  waitress was friendly, thorough, spunky and a perfect addition to this hip, vibrant, happening place.  admittedly, we in our 40s were either parental age of the young 20 somethings gracing the place, or children of the 60+ \"second go round\" set.  bruschetta -- golly!  we had pesto with salami (great quality), burrata with arugula, bacon and tomato (there was no bacon and PLEASE do not refrigerate your tomatoes), prosciutto with fig and mascarpone (oh so incredibly good) and the \"dessert\" one -- ricotta with dates and pistachios.  after polishing off the dips and the platter of breads (there are 4 pieces to each \"slice\" of bruschetta, we were stuffed.    was intrigued by the salted caramel dessert, but there was just no room.  perhaps next time we skip the dip and save room.",

It's like eating dessert.  The only negative is the parking.  You have to valet your car.  However they do have a secret parking lot up the road that is just a short walk.  It's a little north of Cambpell on the west side of 40th street.",

The only reason it gets four stars is because the music inside is really loud and difficult to talk over and the lighting is super low. No, I'm not old.",

(I'm referring to both the guy & the food!)  The wine list is incredible - and there are almost always specials going on so you can try something new without breaking the bank. The food is delicious - I always suggest anyone try the bruchetta planks, and any of their salads are a delicious choice. I love both the Arcadia and Central locations the same; Arcadia seems to be where I frequent the most just due to proximity of our home. If you haven't been, just try it! Great food, great drinks, great staff, and friendly customers.",

We go every Monday for the $20 board and bottle of wine special they have after 8 pm. One draw back is sometimes the wait can be 1-2 hours long (On these nights we go to LGO instead).  Postinos is also a great source for entertainment. People think it's a great first or second date spot. They are wrong. The one down town is significantly quieter and a way better date spot. But, there are always at least five new couples there. If you're a low talker or extremely shy you should probably try somewhere else. But don't worry, I'll be there every Monday night with my bottle of wine.",

They also usually have really delicious hearty soup and I love their salads and paninis. They have $5 glasses of wine before 5pm every day and their peach bellinis are perfect for Sunday brunch. My husband likes their mini pitchers of beer. We would eat here every day if we could. The only negative is the shortage of parking spaces, forcing you to valet.

    "text": "I joined a friend for lunch here last week and we were able to sit outside and enjoy our perfect weather.  We both had the Pick 2 special.  I had the salad and soup.  Soup (chicken &n rice) was perfect temperature and had great flavor.  Salad was fresh and I was able to pick from their long list of salad choices.  I LOVE THAT. Many places will match your soup up with a plain side salad, not here!   My friend had a scrumptious looking vegetable panini on ciabatta bread  with a side salad.    The other great thing about Postino's is their early Happy Hour.  Any, I repeat any, glass of wine is $5 until 5:00pm.  They have an extensive wine list with some great choices.   The ambiance here, well if you haven't been you are sorely missing out.  I love the old brick style building surrounded by lush flora.  The decor is modern yet comfy.  Don't miss this place!",

As all would say, get a bruschetta board and bottle of wine and call it a day, you and your date will have the perfect night.  must picks are the prosciutto and apple.",

    "text": "Okay; this place is pretty dang tasty and their most popular dishes are the Bruschetta! How can little pieces of bread with an assortment of toppings can be so amazing?   To name a few: Ricotta with dates & pistachios: The cheese is not over powering and the date gives it the sweetness whereas the pistachios give it a nice crunch.   Prosciutto with figs & mascarpone: Luckily it was fig season because you can never go wrong with prosciutto and figs!   Salmon and pesto: It's something that everyone usually gets but honestly this was kind of a disappointment. The salmon was a bit thin and I didn't like it with the pesto.   Brie & Apples with fig spread: Brie is literally the tastiest cheese. buttery, sweet and crunchy from the apple (another favorite)   The bruschetta does change occasionally but they keep some of the popular ones on the menu. Great place to hang out with your friends and drink wine from their extensive wine bar.",

Favorite slab consists of: Roasted Red Peppers on Goat Cheese, Warm Artichoke, Dates, Pistachios with Ricotta and Sheeps Milk below a sweet Tomato Jam.    The only *bad* (more so just personally annoying), thing I've ever come across here, had nothing to do with the food itself or even the servers..well not our server..was when one of the ladies walking around clearing tables felt the need to express to us that SHE has OCD therefore, we needed to remove the last 2 pieces of bruchetta from the board, so she could clear it..because it was making HER uncomfortable..   Never push your 'disorder' off onto someone else and expect them to abide, especially when your customers are deep in mid-conversation about serious things like puppies and the night's baking agenda...this customer will not yield and out of spite, leave a lingering, lonesome bruchetta upon the slab for your sake.   I, too, have a disorder - not caring about your fear of individual bread pieces on a plate.   Despite said occurrence, there are NO complaints, ever. A valley staple that I recommend highly, for all occasions.",

It was moderately busy even on a weekday, so I can't imagine how it would be Friday-Sunday, especially for dinner-packed I'm sure.  The only downside was parking, it seems valet is the only really viable option.  Great decor and atmosphere here.  We walked through inside, but opted to sit outside as the weather was perfect. We ordered the bruschetta and all the selections were great.  My favorite was the smoked salmon while my wife preferred one with peppers.  We also split a raspberry salad of some kind that was also excellent.   My wife had a Malbec that was near the bottom of the list that she really liked, while I was super happy they had Four Peaks Hop Knot on draft. Also great drink prices daily, I think till five o'clock?  This will definitely be a return often type place when anywhere in the area!",

The service is good and so is the food, but from a noise perspective (I'm a noise nerd and acoustician), I cannot deal with the acoustics in this joint. I believe this shares part of the old post office but damn if it wasn't filled with hard surface decor making all that noise reverberate even more.   I'm a social eater so where's the fun if it's too damn loud to hear your dining companions? Structural criticisms aside, the food is as good as my preferred location on Central. Just like the location on Central, though, I do not care for forced valet. Blocking off all the spots and not giving me a choice with what to do with my vehicle  really grinds my gears!",

    "text": "Postino Arcadia is one of my top choices for Sunday brunch.  Don't get me wrong - you can definitely go and have a rocking time for evening cocktails and snacks, but I think they shine the brightest for Sunday brunch.  If I'm in this area in the evening, we'll usually grab pizza from LGO instead.  First of all, the portions are great - some fancier places serve small brunch portions which can leave you a little hungry, but you won't have that issue at Postino.  Do yourself a favor and start with the farmhouse scone.  I'm not a huge scone fan, but this one is perfection.  My go-to meals are the grilled focaccia or the smoked salmon.  Order one (or both) - neither will disappoint!  For drinks, you can get french press coffee or treat yourself and have a mimosa or bellini ($5 each).  The atmosphere is very friendly (sit outside if you can) and the service is great.  I highly recommend this place (unless you arrive before me and take my table)!  Also, there is free valet during busier hours!",

    "text": "Postino is normally one of our favorite local spots to grab a drink and some dinner. Last night however, was a different story. I can honestly say that after our experience yesterday evening, we will more than likely not be going back to Postino for quite some time.       The first issue we had was witnessing a waiter take water glasses off of a table, dump them into a pitcher of water, then dump that pitcher into another pitcher, and continue to go around the restaurant refilling cups. I for one think this is absolutely disgusting, and refused to drink my (much needed) glass of water. This was all before we waited roughly 15 minutes before being seen by a waiter at all. We placed our drink orders, and a few minutes later our drinks showed up - great. At this point we placed our food order. About 15-20 minutes later our bruschetta showed up, we nearly finished off the board, and about 30-40 minutes later, we had still not received our main courses. I kindly asked the host at the stand behind us if he could tell us how long it may be, since we had an appointment we needed to be at soon. He came back to our table, and said that our waiter told him it would be just a few minutes. 5 minutes later our waiter came strolling up to our table, with no food. He said that he hadn't put in our order, and that it would be out within a few minutes. Again, we said that we had somewhere we needed to be, and were very polite. About 5 MORE minutes passed, and finally our food showed up. I asked for the check, saying once more that we had somewhere to be and needed to leave immediately following our very late meal. We finished our meal, and sat for somewhere between 5-10 minutes AFTER our plates were empty before our check arrived. Mind you - we watched our waiter walk around the restaurant the entire time, talking to other servers, the host, and anyone else other than us. We were never given a discount, and had to pay for the entire (completely unworthy) bill.      We were throughly disappointed in our most recent experience, and have already warned others of the poor service we received. Would definitely avoid this place if you have any hopes of having quality service.",

Bowl of water and constant affection from the staff every time my hound comes along. She's spoiled here and it make me happy.  Food is still fabulous and the wine...Oh the wine.

Expectations may have been off, as we came here for a nice dinner, but this place probably should be treated more as a trendy appetizer or drink spot. Great atmosphere and service, and at one point could picture having a large group together on the large seating area in the back. Not really sure what I'm missing though, the bruschetta was good-not-great, and if you don't feel like a salad or panini for an entree, your options seem limited. For a trendy drinking hole, there could've been a few more than 4 beers on tap. As tasty as Deschutes River Ale is, there are usually more options in most other bars that offer any craft beer. Didn't take a serious look at the wine list this time around. Trying many different kinds of bruschetta in one order was a nice way to taste many things, and appreciate that they were trying interesting ingredients such as the tomato spread, but again, nothing I'll be remembering or craving. Would like to try the butchers block if there's another visit. Didn't try the dessert, as La Grande Orange is right next door, and our loyalties are there for sweets. The outdoor patio looked inviting, and would like to kick it there when its not so Phoenix-y in the middle of summer. Would like to give it another shot some other time, but probably wouldn't wait in line to do so.",

We started with meal with the olives and then both had salads. I had the Hannah's Field Salad - Kale, quinoa, Fuji apple, apricot, toasted almonds, pecorino stagionato, and pickled red onion with apple cider-mustard vinaigrette. It was quite tasty, a little dry so maybe a splash more of vinaigrette, and the quinoa was cooked perfectly.  A nice blend of flavors and textures throughout. The place has a very nice wine, beer, beverage and cocktail list and you can even take a bottle of wine to go. The place looks like a converted gas station and they have outdoor seating and various seating areas inside.  Note:  Valet parking is $3 upon leaving.",

    "text": "I've been putting off writing this review for ages, mainly because I love it so much that I want to do it justice. You're intimidating me, Postino! You're intimidating me with your loveliness!  Just get your butt to the Monday/Tuesday happy hour special. Just do it and get it over with for the first time so henceforth you will realize that it is where you need to be on Monday and/or (yes there have been a few occasions I have gone two nights in a row DON'T JUDGE ME) Tuesday night.   You get any bottle of wine and a plate of the most decadent bruschetta, for $20. We're not talkin' a few little slices of bread with some chopped romas and basil... We're talking about full-flavored, substantially protein'd, tasty-ass bruschetta here, folks. You get to choose 4 of the 12 varieties they offer, and you get 4 slices of each. That way you and whoever you go with, can try them all. TWO PIECES OF EACH FOR ME AND TWO OF EACH FOR YOU, NO CHEATING. I'm watching you. And counting. And nomming.   Here are my favs: The prosciutto w/ figs and marscapone Smoked salmon w/ pesto Brie & apples w/ fig spread Tomato jam & fresh sheeps milk cheese  Good god I want it and I want it now.  Some of the wines I've had are excellent. Some are just ok. That happens when you frequent this place as much as I do, and their wine list is ever-changing. I have discovered some of my favorite wines here, and nothing ever that I would turn my nose up at.   I've now written so much about their food and wine that I am going to skip right over ambiance. It's awesome. End of story. And well worth the sometimes 1 hour wait.  Probably my favorite restaurant in Phoenix. Probably.",

They offer a seasonal which is always really delish! I like that the bread is rock hard, and everything is always fresh! This is one of my favorite meals, yes I said meals! I can eat an entire platter by myself! My mom LOVES the spicy jam and goat cheese!   They also have really great drinks, and I personally like their honey cucumber lemonade!",

I always come here for Board and Bottle in the evening, the ambiance is so cute, with the lights and the shrubs that separate the restaurant from the parking lot. Joseph served us this last week and we had a great time. However, the interaction with all of the other employees has been great. The only awkward part is when I get seated next to my friends like we are on a date, but we always make it a fun time!",

The other location being so close to ASU, you expect it to be a bit more...youthful and vivacious.   I can understand and respect that completely.  This Arcadia spot is more my speed: quieter, laid back, and the outdoor seating among the botanical-rich patio transcends me from my busy life.  Both locations deserve 5stars in my opinion.   Now I must try every location for a comparison...Central Ave or Kierland next?  I'm sure I can't go wrong!",

    "text": "Postino, oh Postino. You never disappoint. No matter what time I show up, Postino has my back.   I've been to this location twice: once for a group lunch on the patio and once with a friend for brunch. Both times were excellent.   Deal: They usually have a drink deal of some sort: a small pitcher of beer or a glass of wine for $5 during lunch time, or a glass of bubbly- champagne, prosecco or sparkling rose for $5 during brunch. My favourite of course, is the bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20. I've only gone to the Tempe location for this deal, however I'm sure it would be awesome here as well given my other experiences at this location.   Service: I've never had a bad experience here. They were attentive, but not overbearing.   Food: I want to give whoever created this menu a big hug. They basically use all my favorite ingredients in all their dishes like pesto, delicious bread, savory meats, artichokes... the list could go on forever. For lunch, I've had their 1/2 sandwich and salad combo. If I'm grabbing lunch with my boyfriend, we can usually split a whole sandwich- they're pretty hefty.   Brunch yesterday was also delicious. I had the country toast with Italian ham, dijonaise (is that Dijon with mayonnaise?), and gruyere. It had these amazingly fresh tomatoes tossed in pesto. That was by far my favorite part. I wonder if I can just order a bowl of that next time.   There will be a next time; the question however, is what time of the day it will be.",

    "text": "Bruschetta heaven! Postino Arcadia is a romantically decorated and very cute Italian wine bar in that I was dying to try during my short trip to Phoenix.  FOOD: 7/10 SERVICE: 7/10 ATMOSPHERE: 10/10  FOOD:  + Smoked Salmon with Pesto ($15 for 4 flavors): Yum! This was really great cause I'm a huge fan of smoked salmon and pesto. It wasn't particularly fresh or populated with salmon though.   + Almond Hummus & Tomato Bruschetta ($15 for 4 flavors): This was delicious as well! I highly recommend this if you like hummus.  + Salami with Pesto Bruschetta ($15 for 4 flavors): This was okay! If it was up to me, I would've gotten another order of the Smoked Salmon with Pesto. There was only one piece of salami, and it was very mediocre.  + Warm Artichoke Spread ($15 for 4 flavors): SO CHEESY. I can't particularly handle cheese, so I didn't like this at all. I do not recommend this if you don't love cheese.  + Turkey Panini: Good enough! Nothing spectacular but it was tasty.  + Brussel Sprouts Salad: Not what I was expecting AT ALL. It was mostly regular salad leaves with some brussel sprout leaves at the bottom. I was definitely expecting whole brussel sprouts or at least more of it. Not impressed with this.  SERVICE: Decent service. They were attentive and refilled my water a lot but weren't very friendly.  ATMOSPHERE: So cute! Very romantic. We sat on the outside patio where there was mist to keep us cool from the 107 degree Phoenix heat. Lots of lights and lush greenery. Good date spot.  Overall, would recommend it purely for the ambiance and bruschetta options. Not the freshest or best food I've had but pretty good for Phoenix restaurants.",

My personal fav would be the prosciutto with fig and mascarpone. The board comes with four different bruschetta choices all for only $15, and the bruschetta is big so you'll get full!  Highly suggest coming on Tuesday for their wine deal where you get a whole bottle of wine and bruschetta board for just $20.   Lastly, top it off off with their salted caramel sundae,ahhhhh-mazing!!  Chocolate covered corn nuts, pretzel and caramel topping vanilla ice cream, how can you go wrong?  Can't say enough good things about this restaurant, I go all the time! Oh wait one more thing, it's pet friendly on the outdoor patio :)",

    "text": "My husband and I went to Postino for a dinner date during a recent weekend trip to Phoenix. It wasn't quite what we expected--we'd assumed it was the kind of Italian place where you could get a glass of wine and a plate of pasta--but we had a great time.  Our reservation was for eight o'clock on a Saturday night, and the place was busy but comfortable. It felt intimate and not too crowded. The lighting was low, and the space was warm and charming. A great go-to date spot. Service was great. Our waitress was friendly and helpful, and we were well taken care of.  Postino is more a wine bar than a full sit-down restaurant, with reasonably priced bottles and a menu that consists of large format antipasti and paninis. We ordered a bottle of Canto Sur, a red blend of mostly cabernet and carmenere. You can get wines by the glass here, but the bottle prices are only three times the glass prices, putting most of the bottles in the high twenties/low thirties range. We were happy with the wine. We also ordered a few antipasti and tried to order paninis for our dinner when our waitress stopped us--she said what we thought were antipastis would fill us up plenty, and she was absolutely right.  Granted, we were planning to order a pretty big spread of appetizers. We shared the butcher's block, the pub board, and a selection of four bruschetta. Did not realize that each of these boards would be gigantic. Everything was delicious. The butcher's block came with plenty of meat--prosciutto, coppa, salami, and peppered salami--along with goat cheese and white bean hummus. There was crostini, of course, and a huge assortment of great accompaniments--olives, dried cranberries, almonds, asparagus, cherry tomatoes, smoked yellow tomatoes, and three kinds of pickle.The pub board brought another huge spread, this one of MJ's soft pretzels, Scrheiner's chorizo, cornichons, aged cheddar, and giant Spanish corn nuts. It was fun to mix and match everything on these boards, and it was all fantastic. The bruschetta seems to be the main draw of Postino, but I didn't understand why until our selection arrived. We opted to order four of them for $14, and were expecting bruschetta sized like bruschetta. These were more like full-on flatbreads, with the four bruschetta adding up to about a pizza in volume. We had the tomato jam and fresh sheep's milk cheese, the salami with pesto, the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, and the burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato. Not a dud in the bunch--loved all the meat, and the tangy cheese with the sweet tomato jam was perfect on its own.  We took great pleasure in our feast of antipasti and wine. We ate with our hands and enjoyed the variety. I'd love to go back to Postino next time I'm in Phoenix. I'd be a regular if I lived in town.",

Bruschetta is  tasty and ranges from light to heavy, something for everyone. Would order all the below again:  Smoked salmon / pesto - salmon was fresh and delicious. Just a smidge of pesto, not smeared Brie & apple w/fig spread - simple but refreshing. Thinly sliced Granny Smith on brie. Fig spread is jammy and adds the perfect depth. Burrata, bacon, arugula, tomatoes - the burrata was outstanding. would've preferred this w/o the bacon, which somewhat overpowered this bruschetta Prosciutto, figs, mascarpone - brilliant combination  The Pub Board is a great concept and cleverly presented - sliced soft pretzels, cornichons, aged cheddar (delish), giant corn nuts (so fun!) - just lacking stone ground mustard for the pretzels! Maybe they could add this...  Loved our server - pleasant and professional.",

    "text": "I've been a longtime Yelp lurker over many years, and have read thousands of reviews that have lead me to awesome finds and away from the not-so-greats.    Postino gets the privilege of being my first review! I have been in the Phoenix area for a total of 7 days since January and I have ended up at various Postino locations 4 times in those days. That says a lot from somebody who normally would always try a new place instead of frequenting the same spot over and over. Here's why:  Fun vibe - casually bougie without the pretense (it's possible!).  Awesome servers - attentive and personable without being annoying or overbearing. Amazing bruschetta - perfectly toasted with great combinations of toppings. I prefer the savory over sweet.  Excellent wine and beer selections - they've got your standards plus the locals plus some unique options that'll keep you busy. Price is right - I'll gladly share my student loans + interest with Postino, even after 5pm as I did last night with a group of friends.  I will say the cheap Asian in me isn't a fan of the valet parking (it's not always there, though). They are lucky I'm too lazy to walk in the heat of summer. My mother would be so disappointed if she knew I paid for valet.    As a new transplant just down the road, I have a feeling I'll be back many times.  For those of us busy during the day, I am so happy they have weekend happy hour and date night specials. Just need to find the date first, but I won't digress... ;p  Really though, other restaurants should take note.",

Parking is a pain (I'll park my own car, thankyouverymuch) but after that it was all good. It was a chilly Phoenix night, but the open wall seems to somehow work well -- the outside seating melds nicely into the inside. If the forecast calls for cool temps, I recommend that you bring a light jacket.  All of the staff I encountered were great. The first chick recommended a fabulous red which I enjoyed immensely. When my friends arrived, we had the Pub Board and a couple of Bruschetta boards -- fantastic!!  We had fig and apple, warm artichoke spread, smoked salmon and capers, roasted peppers and goat cheese...just delicious. The pretzels and spicy mustard were the best I've ever had, anywhere.   The atmosphere and ambiance are close to perfect. I'll definitely bring friends here!",

    "text": "Set up: girl that is almost always hungry or ready for her next meal + late flight into Phoenix the night before (thereby missing dinner) = ravenous girl @ Postino  Summer Delight (SD) and I were seated at a pretty perfect table, in the corner, next to the window. Which definitely came in handy in terms of hiding our slight shame when the onslaught of food and booze arrived at our tiny little table for 2!  In True fattiness, we ordered enough food to feed a family of 5! And of course with their happy hour offerings for wine and beer it was too awesome to pass up on!   1. Selection of 4 Bruschetta's: pretty good variety of options, ingredients were fresh, generously portioned and flavor combinations worked. My only problem was the bread to goods ratio. Even though I am a thorough carbivore, it was a bit too much bread for my pref and I tend to like less dense bread for my bruschetta. Nonetheless a great deal for $14!  2. Autostrada Panini - I am not one to pass up on any meat, on meat, on meat, on meat action (yes, 4 types of salty cured pig parts...especially in regards to the Soppressata, LOL!)! And the spicy pepper relish was a nice added zing to bring together all that goodness. LOL!!  3. Bella Postino (warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted MJ breads) - Probably...no...definitely could have done without this given the amount of food we already ordered but still a good staple to order if you're here with more than 2 people! Haha!  And then on to the best part! They have a great happy hour where their wine by the glass and PITCHERS of beer are just $5!! Loved that there were so many options! You seldom see that here in San Francisco. So it was quite glorious! There was definitely some remorse that I stuffed myself so much I didn't have more capacity to fully take advantage of it!   SD also introduced me to a locally produced beer, I believe it was the HopShock? Pretty freaking delicious!  Good food/booze and wonderful company certainly made this a very memorable meal! If I ever find myself in AZ again I will definitely revisit this place. Especially now that I have learned from my mistake of not properly allocating my stomach capacity for happy houring here! ^____^  \"I am not a glutton, I am an explorer of food\" ~ Erma Bombeck",

Everything was wonderful and service was friendly, fast, and efficient. The building is also quaint and in a trendy location that provides a solid vibe.  Only complaints, minor ones: First, management has still not redone the wine list to reflect the absence of a selection which we know they haven't had for some time, as we visited the Gilbert location weeks ago; secondly, the on-tap beer selections are a tad embarrassingly underwhelming for a nice place like this. Yet, on the whole, a definite keeper.",

The Salad was amazing, although the panini not so much.   On a side note, I say it isn't good for kids because it's a wine bar, not a restaurant really. However, they do have highchairs available for those that need/want them. It's probably more safe that if you're going to have a glass of wine, leave the kids at home. That's my opinion, but I've found it's more enjoyable without the wee ones. (I have one, so don't think I'm antichildren)  Also, I say it's trendy because it is. I guess depends what spot you are heading to. I always feel like I'm not cutsie enough when I go in, but you know what? I'm paying and relaxing and that's all that matter... I say go casual if you're brave like me, and don't mind a head turn from one or two noticing your shoes don't match your ____.",

Parking is valet like pretty much all of Arcadia but valet is complimentary during lunch, Nice!   We were seated within a few minutes of arriving.  Checked out the wine list and was pleasantly surprised to find that all wines by the glass were $5 until 5 pm. The selection was good and I really enjoyed the 2 I tried. Service was friendly and attentive throughout without being annoying.   We ordered a board of bruschetta of course. We chose the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, & Tomato, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, and Prosciutto with Figs & Marscarpone. I liked the sweet/savory combo of the Prosciutto one best and my BF said the Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, & Tomato was everything he wanted and more. All were delicious tho! Can't wait to try the others on my next visit!",

    "text": "First of all I'm starting off by giving it three stars because I think it is crazy that the parking lot is as small as it is and that it is valet parking!! Our waiter had absolutely no sense of humor whatsoever and had to make the comment that he was leaving shortly as if he was glad not to have us as customers.  Seriously, we were 3 50 year old women!! Since it was 4 o'clock in the afternoon we decided that we would just have some wine and bruschetta.  The wine was a Moscato and it actually was very good but I wish the waitress would know enough to put it on ice. My cousin who is a pretty aggressive person, asked for a bucket with ice. It has been quite a few years since I've been here and the bruschetta was definitely not as good as I remembered it.  There were a couple of standouts and then there were some that were just meh. Are tab was ninety dollars, and for that amount I would have expected a lot more. I think this place is a great hangout for people who live in the area or for those who want to be seen in a trendy restaurant. With so many new restaurants opening up I don't think I will be visiting this one for a long time.",

The 5 dollar glasses of wine for happy hour are great.    The ambience in all of the restaurants owned by this group are amazing.  Its similar to Windsor, but with different food.  It's the kind of place you have a great time hanging out on because the clean/modern/hip atmosphere rubs off on you!  Highly recommended",

A cute wine bar reportedly set in an old Post Office- hence POSTino, but is not apparent with the trendy decor and lively yet intimate atmosphere perfect for a date or group of friends.   The Happy Hour on Tuesday really is a steal. I came on a double date, each couple ordering a bottle of wine and bruschetta (arguably pronounced brush-ket-ah) totaling a mere $20 a pair!  The wine selection is fairly eclectic. The BF and I rather arbitrarily picked the Carro Red Blend from Spain, a \"Postino Exclusive\". When it came to the taste test the waitress did not assume the man would decide and let me taste for satisfaction (yes- I felt empowered). Fantastico! Perfect mix of smooth with a kick that's not too bitey or intense.   The bruschetta came in generous portions of 4x4, 4 slices of 4 different selections, the perfect amount of food to complement half a bottle of wine. Each was amazing but the gold medal goes to the White Bean and Chopped Tomato. The savory, sweet and tangy flavors will make your tastebuds dance for joy.   TIP: avoid the crowd by arriving before 6:30 or after 8:30. Our 7:00 arrival left us waiting 40 min for a table but my 4 stars says it was well worth it!",

    "text": "I have been to this location on 3 separate occasions. Food is consistently delicious!! Parking is consistently crappy. You have to be one of the lucky 5 people to get a non-valet spot. If you don't, good luck finding street parking that isn't resident-only. Sometimes your only choice is valet. I guess I'm cheap, but it makes me angry that I have to tip a guy to walk 10 feet to get my car. Oh well. 2 of the 3 times I have been the service was great. This last time, was not so great. I was in a large party (~10 people) and they sat us right away, which was awesome. The place was not very busy as we were there for a very early dinner on a Sunday (4pm). Our waiter took our drink orders at 4:15, they were delivered and then disappeared until 5 (which is, you guessed it, then end of Happy Hour). He came back at 5:01 on the dot. Kinda sucks. As we were all hungry and eager to order, but it was not until sometime later that he re-appeared for the food order. \\  He did the whole, \"I'm too awesome to write down any of your orders\" bit. Even though we were each getting an order of Bruchetta (which gives the option to choose 4). Luckily, he got our orders correct, but if he hadn't? I am not going to tip you more because you didn't write it down!  Even if you get it right 95% of the time, it's really crappy for that 5% that you mess up! Anyway, our food came and it was delish!   When our bill came, I realized why he didn't show his face more than the few times over the 3 hours that we were sitting there....they pre-added in his tip. 20%! He was made whether he gave us good service or not.   I will be going back because, like I said, I usually have great service and ALWAYS have great food....but this one encounter did put a sour taste in my mouth.",

The valet boy and one of the other men waiting for a table gave us good reviews so we said, why not?  It's been a long while since my friend and I saw each other so we were talking a lot in-between trying to figure out what to order.  The waitress had to come back 3 times before we settled on something, but she was cool with it.  Known for their bruschetta and sandwiches, that's exactly what we ordered.  The bruschetta came with 4 different options so we chose Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil (good), Chopped Tomato with Pesto (very fresh and tasty), Salami with Pesto (slightly salty but very good), and the Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone (my favorite).  Thinking we weren't going to be full on just some bread, we also ordered the ham & cheese panini (nicely toasted and yummy).  It comes with a salad and the waitress split this w/o us mentioning it.  We ended up only eating half the sandwich and half the bruschetta.  The bruschetta were big (about the size of your palm -- not mine, because I have small hands) and thick as well.  The toppings were generous and all very fresh.  I'd definitely come back next time I'm in town.",

I really like the atmosphere...very urban-chic feel.  Lovely interior design.  Makes me feel like I stepped into a restaurant you would find on the streets of Manhattan or San Francisco.    We shared a bruschetta plate that allowed 4 options from their extensive \"toppings\" menu.  It was a lot food for two people, so I had the privilege of taking home some leftovers for dinner.  All I can say is, \"Yum!\"  I liked the variety of options and the rich, organic flavors (and if you really think about it, it's just toppings on some good, crunchy bread.).    I also tried their cucumber lemonade drink.  Very interesting and different...but definitely refreshing.  I would say that I'd order it again because after I left the restaurant, I found myself wanting more of it.    Parking is the only thing that sucks about that place...hence, just giving it 4 stars.  Thankfully, valet is complimentary during lunch (but we still left a tip).  :)",

I've been here a trillion times (okay, maybe not that much), but have always had good experiences here - even when I accidently lit a napkin on fire at the table.   I have very little patience for waiting anywhere, but I will wait a half an hour to be seated here, which is pretty often on busy weekends with a party more than two. The wine list is hand-selected and always amazing. The bruschetta is TDF (which, is one of the things I miss most about being #glutenfree), I recommend the ricotta and pistachios and the apple one. Their sandwiches are amazing (although I don't actually like their focaccia bread, I always went with the cibata). The waiters generally remember who you are, and some of them even remembered the wine I get so much so that when they rotated it out of the menu they were genuinely concerned and addressed it as soon as I arrived!   On Sundays and (I think) a weekday night, they have live music. SUCH a great ambiance! If you love olives as much as I do, you have to try the olive sampler platter. It's brilliant. Even their soups are delicious. If I ever move, I will miss this place for sure. Oh, and try the creme brule. It's a must!",

The proscuitto and fig is my absolute favorite, followed by the artichoke, brie and apple, and salmon and capers. The restaurant has a great interior and patio with a huge wall glass garage door that opens up to connect the interior to the exterior when the weather is nice. If you join their mailing list, you get a free bruschetta board on your birthday and the restaurant's birthday. I also love their sea salt caramel sunday - it's the most delicious dessert ever.

    "text": "This place is great!  I love it, not only for the ambiance and decor, but the food is great too.  Some people might not like that there aren't a lot of menu choices (mostly salads and sandwiches), but that is perfect for me because I am too indecisive if a menu has too many choices on it.  LOVE the bruschetta.  I get it everytime.  Share it with friends though, it's pretty big, even as a meal.  My favorite choices are the Tuscan White Bean and the Prusciutto and Fig bruschetta- but they're all pretty good.  If I had one complaint, it would be the parking situation.  It's really tough to find a spot to park so you pretty much have to valet.  They added some parking across the street, but it's still not enough.  Other than that, this is a great place to go and chill out, have a glass of wine or two, and enjoy some nice light food.  Saturday afternoons are probably the best time to go if you want to avoid the rush.",

But come on, people - IT'S ALL ABOUT THE BRUSCHETTA! Holy cow - what delicious topping combinations! Ricotta w/dates & pistachios. Prosciutto w/figs & mascarpone. I could go on...   Great time here - my two small complaints were (1) the sauvignon blanc by the glass is one of those \"SB w/semillon\" concoctions - not our fave by a long shot, and (2) i like my bread a bit crispier for bruschetta, but understand it's a house style.  When next in Phoenix, we'll be back.",

Being from Washington I was surprised I had never tried it before but I'm glad I know about it now.  I went with 4 kinds of bruschetta first the smoked salmon and pesto one of my fav's then keeping with the pesto theme I had the salami and pesto, then the traditional tomato mozzarella and basil, and last a new one for me tuna and olives which was amazing.  I love this place if you have never been your missing out and if you have been you know it's always a great meal.",

Had the olives and pub board as appetizers along with a very nice Spanish red wine that was suggested by the server. The Pub Board was fantastic with Portuguese chorizo, cheese, and a very yummy homemade pretzel. The olives were a really great sampling of many different types and they all complimented our wine well too.   Hubby had the Autostrada with the potato cheese soup, I had the 9 Iron with soup, friends split the Proscuitto with Brie with chips. All were positively perfect!  For dessert, we ordered a bottle of a white Spanish wine Fuente Milano and it had a nice grapefruity after taste that was very cleansing on the palate before we had the Chocolate Bouchon, the Creme Brulee, and the salted carmel sundae. OMG...all were so yummy and the wine went perfectly!  The nicest part about Postino is that it isn't on a main Scottsdale Rd. drag....it's actually nestled on a side street off of 39th St. and Campbell. You'd never know it was there if you weren't looking for it but apparently plenty of people know about it because it was hopping at noon yesterday.  If you haven't tried it....go. You won't regret it. It was hip, fun, and the food was realistically priced and absolutely DELICIOUS!",

We could not believe how delicious the food was at Postino, and the service was incredible too! The artichoke dip put Houston's to shame, and the bruschetta, and vegetarian panini were all mouth-watering.  We greatly look forward to going back!

While there were large portions, it still has the vibe of a cocktail hour that happens before weddings, with more appetizer food.    3 things you need to know:  -Split the bruchetta and maybe order an appetizer for u two.  $12-13 -My favorite was the smoked salmon bruschetta.  2nd favorite was the apple brie. -Order the vanilla ice cream topped with salted caramel and...get this..chocolate covered cornuts.

Mandatory parking sucks, because my truck is usually dirty, inside and out. I'm taking a star off myself for that.   Conclusion: The bad isn't really bad, I'm just cheap. Someday when I'm rich and famous, I'll look at the check, laugh, and throw hundred dollar bills at the table and be like \"Shut up and take my money!\"",

With a drink in hand, it was a pleasure to check out the wines and the milieu of this place of business. It's quite nice, it is however not very big and it can get quite loud in here. Not too loud for a simple conversation, but loud enough for me to take notice.  Once seated the service was great. Our server was a knowledgeable and energetic gentleman that gladly helped out in any decision making regarding the menu. I tried their beer selection as well as had a cheese tray. Note: For being a wine place, they sure do take pride in their beer selection - however I must say that I was not impressed by their cheese. They seem to take pride in their cheese diversity, but I was simply not impressed.  The service was great, the ambiance was relaxing, and the patrons were nice.. I truly enjoyed my visit and will be returning to this establishment. It wasn't expensive, but it isn't cheap nor should it be. (But they have unbelievable early weekdays specials) I give this place a 4, it has 5 potential - but then they have to step up the food a notch, and by food I mean cheese.",

This is a great place for a get together with friends or an intimate date night.

Walking in, there's absolutely no indication that Katz was ever here, even though the shell of the building remains.  That said, mad props to Postino for preserving this landmark.  Too be fair, I'm not a wine expert nor a frequent wine drinker.  If you are, you're more than covered at this neighborhood hangout.  The food, while a limited selection, is excellent.  I've had a couple of the paninis and the bruschetta and I've never been disappointed.  My favorites are the Turkey Panini and the Smoked Salmon and Pesto Bruschetta.  Light and flavorful and a nice complement to the Syrah I had.    The atmosphere is very urban and industrial and is absolutely jam packed at night.  A little noisy at times for my taste as sometimes I've had to yell at my friends for them to hear me, but I pretty much expected that with the crowd this place draws.  All in all, a nice addition to the neighborhood.  Postino's reputation in the Arcadia neighborhood brought me in, and the good food and relaxed atmosphere has made me a believer.  If you're a nightlife fan then come here at dinnertime or after a movie.  If you're a foodie (like me) I recommend coming here for lunch (or Sunday Brunch) when its more relaxed and not as crowded.  If you're a wine buff, then you're good here at all hours.  RIP to Katz, but a nice new chapter for this historic location",

I  enjoyed my cab: slightly smoky and full flavored. Mr H enjoyed his pinot noir.  we split the bruschetta,  it was tasty and the varieties of the bruschetta were unique and fresh.     The parking is crazy here!  valet is 3 bucks. I am a fan, however the ambiance felt a little generic in my opinion (too trendy).   Overall the wine was great and bruschetta was memorable.",

The wine selection is amazing here but it would be nothing without the educated, considerate, polite and helpful employees.  i have never had a bad night at this establishment.  My favorite night to go is on Tuesday's because they have the best deal in town-a board of Bruschetta (4) and a bottle of wine from their special menu for $20.  Plus if you don't finish the bottle-you can bag it and take it home! My favorite Bruschetta are the roasted peppers w goat Cheese, the Apple and Fig and the Prosciutto and Mascarpone one...Mmmmmmm Delish! If you haven't been in yet and you love to lounge, drink wine and listed to good music-GO HERE.",

    "text": "Another one of those Camelback places where they basically force you to valet park or head a few blocks away and take your chances in the residential neighborhoods, which is of course what I chose. Valet parking ain't for me anywhere. Try building a parking lot Phoenix before you cram your little fancy wine bars, etc into the area. If you don't like the snobby crowd than steer clear of Postino. Luckily, I arrived before 5pm and squeezed out one glass of $5 wine. If your late, prepare for the $12 wine glass fee ripoff rate. Seems to be a place where all they serve is Brushetta at crazy prices again. It's 14 bucks for 4 pieces of toast with various stuff on them. Personally, brushetta will always just be olive oil, tomatoes and basil on grilled toast. Never tried the food because they have no Happy Hour food deals. Wine bar brings out the gay crowd too, not that there is anything wrong with that, but I will stick to sports bars in the future.     Oh there are no TV sets at all. Had to mention that. NO TV's. NO sports.",

Hostess:  Super nice. Greeted us with a smile. Added our names and told us how long the wait would be without asking.   Atmosphere:  This place really wants to be swanky with rows of wine bottles, a bar and a lounge type area. I felt like it was too dark. I was reading my menu by candlelight and I hated it. I wanted a flashlight or something. My eyes started to hurt!   Service: Our server was great and gave us suggestions, was very friendly and brought everything in a timely manner. She checked on us every so often which I appreciated.  Water was refilled by someone else without asking.   Food:  We only had the bruchetta and wine. The hubby picked two and I picked two for the sampler: prosciutto with figs and mascarpone tomato jam and fresh sheeps milk cheese  smoked salmon with pesto burrata, bacon, arugula and tomatoes  1 thing you have to know about me is that I do not like sweet tasting food. For me, sweet is for dessert. Knowing that, you can probably guess I wasn't a fan of the 1st two which were the ones my hubby picked. But I ate them anyways. I liked the one with figs better than the tomato jam. The hubby really liked them both. I liked both the savory ones and am determined to make them at home.   Clientele: People are way too dressed up to come here. Take that as you wish.",

    "text": "Having a late night dinner last night at Postinos with two friends passing through town once again confirmed my love for this quaint wine cafe.  Do not pass up the bruchetta.  You can mix it up by choosing four over sized pieces for $12.  I love the arugula/buratta and mozz/basil/tomato but fig and cheese is the winner!  All sans meat but positive feedback on the meat selections.  We shared a generously plated cheese board ($14) and the pub board consisting of fresh pretzel-like bread, spicy nuts, cheese bits and a tasty mustard.  My friend also like their broccoli cheese soup.  I've had the vegetarian panini in the past which I enjoyed although the humus was a little overpowering and messy. I'd get it on the side next time. The salad served with it is phenomenal.   The wait staff at both locations are great.  I felt bad for walking in 15 minutes before closing last night but I really, really wanted my friends to eat there.  We were greeted with a friendly face and our waiter was very attentive and conversational despite the time. We weren't rushed and were able to enjoy catching up over a bottle of wine and tasty meal on a perfect for patio evening.   Downside is parking. The place was bare last night so that wasn't a problem. Friday/Saturday night is going to be a fight.  Also, they will not take reservations of less than six and WILL NOT seat you until your whole party is available.  Not so good for the group I usually go with but we're all learning to be more timely!  It can be a long wait but worth it!",

We had the red peppers and goat cheese, apple brie and dates, classic bruschetta, and the smoked salmon. All were delicious!  The atmosphere is pretty trendy, and you have to valet your car cause there is no parking around the area.  To be honest its a little hard to have conversations in there as the music was pretty loud.  I could see how they would have that cause it seemed geared more to a younger crowd.  That was the only drawback.  I also had one of their Panini's, the Nine Iron.  It was good but could of done with out so much lettuce and had more meat.  Overall a great experience and coming back again to enjoy the bruschetta board.",

    "text": "I have been a regular customer of Postinos Arcadia for about 2 years.  I initially fell in love w/ the ambiance and wonderful bruschetta but to make it better, it is within walking distance of my home.  Unfortunately I have been disappointed by my last two visits to Postinos.  Most recently I went Tues. evening (5/10/11) at about 6 p.m.  I ordered a Bruschetta and bottle of wine.  The bruschetta came out quickly but tasted stale.  Really, it seemed like it had been assembled hours earlier and sat on the counter waiting for the order.  So sad.  I thought, \"this is mediocre at best\".  The service was ok, but again, pretty mediocre.    I hate to say it, but it seems like Postinos Arcadia might just be getting comfortable with their reputation and has stopped caring about the quality of food and service they were so well known for.  I want to acknowledge that Tues. evenings come w/ a coupon for a reduced board and bottle of wine after 8 p.m.  I was there at prime dinner hour and felt like I was treated as a customer coming only for the \"Special of the Day\".  I could go just about anywhere in Arcadia and find mediocre bruschetta and service and pay a whole lot less.",

    "text": "Ok, so it was kind of funny. I have a friend in visiting from out of town and her parents are here also visiting family. So on Wednesday night I decided to take her to Postino, because I went to the one on Central and loved the food (hated the service, but the food was great). So I took her to this location. Much better! The place was way less busy (i guess that's because it wasn't one of their special nights) and we were seated right away. We even found parking over by LGO. Whoa. So, anyway, We shared a bruschetta board with the brie and apple, the goat cheese and bell pepper, burrata and bacon, and prosciutto and mascarpone and we each got a glass of wine. (I got the Haart riesling.... *drool* that has got to be one of the best rieslings I have had). So the bruschetta was good, I thought the goat cheese one was not all I had hoped for, but the apple and brie was wonderful and so was the burrata and bacon... I think burrata is my new favorite cheese.... that stuff is good! Anyway, it  was a nice night and everything was fine. So fast forward to the next day. I went with my friend and her parents to the botanical gardens and then we were going to get lunch, so I list a bunch of places we can go and they decide they want to go to LGO (Now I've never been there but really want to try their pizza, it looks amazing). So we get there and realize A) there is no table service and B) there is no pizza. Lame. So my friend says.... we could go back to postino..... haha! So we ended up going again! two days in a row.   So the second time we all got paninis and salads (and wine.... yum and 5$). I got the half and half with the turkey panini and the italian picnic salad. The turkey sandwich was pretty good, it had tomato, greens, pesto, and provolone on it. It tasted good, but nothing too special. The italian picnic salad was also just ok. I couldn't taste the vinaigrette that's supposed to be on it at all... maybe they forgot to put it on... or maybe it is ridiculously light. The other ingredients were good, it had beets, greens, goat cheese, walnuts, and some crispy things in it. My friend got the prosciutto sandwich, which I tried and it was delicious. Her dad got the nine iron which looked really good. Anyway, this was not as good an experience as the night before, but it evens out to four stars. Yay postino!",

The rotating wine menu, the bruschetta, the fantastic house salad, the delectable desserts, the bruschetta, the fantastically crafted sandwiches - did I mention the bruschetta?  Definitely try the prosciutto with figs and mascarpone!  The service here is very good as well, and their hours are fairly accommodating for late evening diners.  On Monday nights there is also the added bonus of being able to order pizza from the pizzeria across the parking lot, and there are a few nights you can find a DJ there mixing it up if that's your thing.  My only (small) issues with this place?  Parking absolutely stinks, and the acoustics leave a lot to be desired.",

The $20 deal is good value (bottle of wine & bruschetta). Full price is not. The bruschetta ingredients are cold, served on cold, un-toasted bread. I have heard they just have a George Foreman grill back there. So, I find stocking up on the antipasto bar items at Sunflower market & grabbing a bottle of wine more enjoyable at home.",

After signing up for prism and internet, I had to reschedule installation. that process took over 20 minutes because they could not find my account and had to do it manually (whatever that meant). I then rescheduled again and it took nearly 30 minutes. I finally cancelled because I was growing increasingly weary of the customer service quality. After I resigned on to Direct TV, I wanted to give the internet a try as I was quoted 30.00 for 40mbps service which cut my cost in half!  After a week, I called customer service as my modem still had not been shipped. I gave the rep my account number they sent me and he could find NO record of my account. he looked for my name, address as well...nothing! he told me I could either do another new enrollment or \"Take this as a giant red flag and go somewhere else\". I opted for the later. Cunsumer beware!",

It's a great place to hang out with friends and chill. I am over most of the nightlife in Phoenix, but Postino is one of those places I don't mind coming on any given day.   One downpart is the wait. A couple years ago, it was pretty easy to stroll in around 8pm on a Friday night and get a table. But, this is more a testament that Postino is a great place to hang out than anything else. Another disappointment is the fact refills are not free.   Postino is one of my favorite places, and I hope this place doesn't fall victim to becoming a Radio Milano or now LGO (which has disappointed me as of late).",

I am not a big bread eater unless its bread on a sandwich and one of the specialties here is their bruschetta, strike 1. I have tried bruschetta and have never been a big fan. I have heard there is no parking and that you had to get the valet to park your car, strike 2. Ok so I do love my wine and so I gave in and agreed to try it. The place was packed on a Thursday afternoon and we were seated at a high-top table by the door, strike 3. Turns out the the brushetta was outstanding. We ordered a combo of four selections, Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios & Smoked Salmon with Pesto, all were excellent and all for 12 bucks. I also ordered, against my will, instead of wine the Cucumber Honey Lemonade. It really sounded disgusting and ended up to be amazing. For desert we ordered the Vanilla bean ice cream with chocolate covered corn nuts, a pretzel stick and salted caramel. They must make the caramel fresh as the unmistakable smell filled the restaurant a couple minutes after ordering it. Oh and that table by the door turned out to be a great spot for people watching and the valet was friendly and quick. I can admit when I am wrong, I can't wait to go back again!",

    "text": "After hearing raves about Postino... I finally got a chance to go check it out. I'm not too much of a drinker, but the $5 Wines By The Glass Happy Hour is great, especially since they've extended it to 5 PM!   It was a leisurely early dinner, getting to Postino about 4:15, and the place was already starting to fill up! (By the time we got our food, around 4:45, it was completely packed!!!) I wanted to try the bruschetta, but my dining companion (my lovely sister) didn't want to split it (due to allergies, more on that later), and I couldn't take home leftovers, so I decided on the Select Two, going with the Autostrada Panini and Italian Picnic Salad without walnuts. I also got a glass of the Ca Del Sarto Pinot Grigio (I only drink whites). My sister had been to Postino multiple times and knew what she wanted to order, knowing it should be allergen (aka nut) free (also the Select Two, the Prosciutto with Brie Panini and Mediterranean Salad). She informed our waitress though of her condition and thankfully our waitress was very responsive. We sat and talked for about a half hour before our food came (watching the mimosas float by our table sped up the time), and I dug right in. However I was alerted to the shaky voice of my sister that she had found a nut in her salad. We called over our waitress and she was super apologetic about it, and quickly set out to resolve the issue. My sister thankfully didn't eat the nut (which turned out to be a walnut)!!! She got a new salad and sandwich and checked everything over, and everything came out a-ok. Our waitress was really great about the whole thing! My food was quite yummy! The sandwich was full of delectable salty meats, but I wished it was a tid bit warmer. The salad was top notch though! I've always avoided beets in my food endeavors, I don't know why, even though I had never tried them, but the Italian Picnic salad has opened my eyes to the glory that is the roasted beet! The different flavors and textures all blended together so nicely, especially with the crispy bacon! I wish I could have pinpointed what was in the dressing so I could recreate it at home! Ah, I guess I'll just have to go again!",

Great for lunch, happy hour, or dinner. Great for clients, friends or dates. Fabulous ambiance inside (always have fabulous music) or on the patio (Central location is my fave). Love the simple modern decor peppered with mid-century touches.  I've used them for catering and it's been a delight and clients LOVE Postino! Nothing on the menu is the wrong choice, absolutely nothing. Incredible ingredients, impeccably chosen. Favorite Bruschetta choices (you choose 4) are: Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, Brie & Apples with Fig Spread. Yum! Best starters: Pub Board, NYC Grilled Cheese (I die for that mustard), and The Butcher's Block. Favorite salad is the Mixed Greens, better than it sounds! I've been known to come in and just have wine and order the bowl of olives for dinner, they are that good. This is one of my happy places, if you haven't been, you must!",

It is an awesome little hangout spot with a great selection of wine and beer and you can't go wrong with any food consisting of bread, brie, prosciutto, figs and the like.  The valet parking and the Range Rovers out front made me nervous for the clientele that comes here (as my boyfriend and I pull up in my Kia) but I have never had such excellent service.  In fact when we walked in we were slightly overwhelmed and didn't quite know who to talk to about a table when the hostess walks up to us and asks if we needed help and my boyfriend blurted out \"we don't know what we're doing!\" and without even smirking she said she'd take our name for our table of 4 and then come find us when one was available, in the mean time we could get a drink and wait at the cocktail tables. Not 30 seconds from when we walked over to the table another waiter walked up to us and asked if we needed a drink and showed us the drink menu. All this at 6:30pm on an already busy Friday night! About 15 minutes pass, our friends show up, we have our drinks and then a section of the bar opens up at the end that nobody else has taken so another waitress/hostess/whatever asks us \"are you a table of 4? would you like to sit here?\" We aren't fussy so we just sit and here we are the rest of the night. My friend even got a free Fish Head (Dogfish?) beer for just being right there when they accidentally poured the wrong one for another patron. I'll definitely have to check this out again on one of the happy hour nights, our waiter got me with the \"Bruschetta Board and bottle of wine for $20 on Tuesday nights\"!",

    "text": "Once an old post office, this cozy little wine cafe brings a rare beauty to bruschetta.  New visitors to this establishment, I have only two suggestions: Skip the paninis, and opt straight for the bruschetta. Do not hesitate to order the \"proscuitto with mascarpone and figs\" What I love about the menu is that one can order up to 4 selections of the bruschetta for $12.75.  This is a very filling choice, but with groups of four you can extend up to 8. I cannot do these delectable eats any justice if I don't give them a name. Recommendations below are my tops, my do or dies:  fresh mozzarella with tomato and basil smoked salmon prosciutto with figs and mascarpone brie and apples with fig spread  the flavors are bold and fresh, even the flavor combinations seem daring on some.  soups and salads are available here, as well as paninis.I am not a fan of paninis, but the prosciutto with brie was very well done.  Best night to come: Tuesday after 8p  ($20 tuesday, where you can enjoy a bottle of wine and bruschetta for only $20)  Happy Hour: Not exactly, but wines by the glass are $5, seven days a week, from 11-5  Dessert menu: Tammy Coe Cakes is next door, so you can sample a selection of her decadent cookies and cakes. Postino also has my favorite, the creme brulee.  The Wine Program: it changes seasonally, which makes coming here again and again a happy surprise.  French, Australian, Chilean, South African, diversity is well represented here in everything from tempranillo to nero d'avola.",

    "text": "Postino Arcadia was better than expected on a recent  visit.  On the way back home from the airport my friend and I decided to stop for a nosh and wine.  When we got there late afternoon, we were welcomed immediately and cheerfully and seated promptly.  As soon as were seated, one of the wait staff brought us water and took our order for a bottle of Caparza.   It was a lovely Italian, a fill bodied Sangiovese Tuscan but not as murky as a Chianti.  It was delicious from the first sip to the last drop.  If you like Italian reds, this is a really good one.                                                                                           We next ordered our food and my friend ordered the bruschetta, I wanted a panini and settled on the autostrada.  One of Postino's delights is to choose your favorites when ordering the bruschetta s there are some wonderful choiced. He ended up with the salmon, caprese, artichoke and the green apple toasts. Each one offers a unique blend of flavors and no one does it better than Postino.  The Autostrada panini has all the right meats and cheeses but I am not a fan of the arugula and tomato.  I took those off and added them to my side salad and took a bite.  Each bite took me back to a stop I made on the way from Naples to Salerno where I had a similar panini with such wonderful flavors.                                                                                                                  The food and wine would earn this wonderful restaurant five stars but the Postino service by committee is not my favorite.  It creates uneven service and no one seems totally responsible for your table.  Other than that, Postino continues to be a wonderful gem in the Arcadia neighborhood and highly recommended.  This was a great improvement from my last visit.",

We had 2 glasses of wine, one of which was Brent's pick. Pretty awesome. Also had some Bruschetta. You just have to try it! Lots of unique offerings. Also had the salted carmel ice cream dessert. Yum!   Would have given it 2 more stars had the service not sucked! Really recommend their waiters and waitresses spend more time at the tables, check up more often at the tables, and do a bit of up selling. Not once were we asked if we wanted anything extra.

    "text": "I love this joint... Postino has become one of my favorite places to grab a bite.  The bruchetta is probably the best I've had in this area next to Armitage, and the size is amazing for the buck.  Out of 10 or so you can choose 4 (fav's are the pepper and goat cheese, the fig and the seasonal), coming out on huge pieces of foccacia cut into fours so you get to keep taking delicious nibbles of each.  Their wine selection is pretty good too, I've fallen in love with the Acadia white that I cant seem to find anywhere else.    Though well priced for the most part, you do have to watch your tab - you can leave with a 30 buck tab up to a 150 tab for two people.   Only negitives I'd say would be the seating, particularly the outside, where they absolutely CRAM you in to the point you might be uncomfortable if you dont like snuggling with your neighbor.  Its great for dates, great place to impress out of towners, and just a great gem of Scottsdale.",

I didn't realize the portions were so huge but my friend and I each ordered four different kinds of bruschetta plus the salmon carpaccio for a starter.  I tried the Tuscan white bean, the prosciutto with figs, the roasted red pepper with goat cheese - phenomenal -- and their seasonal/daily selection, golden beets with goat cheese and mint,  which was just okay.   I wish this place existed in New York; I mean, I'm sure something similar does exist, but probably would NOT be similar in price!",

They offer a wide selection of bruschettas. Each selection is more delicious than the next! I especially love the prosciutto with figs & mascarpone and the ricotta with dates & pistachios. Their salads are tasty and are a perfect portion. I love their Pub Board with a nice cold lager. When they have tomato soup you should get the grilled cheese panini. Soo good! Good prices on wine and other drinks. I've never had to wait very long for a table, maybe 5 mins at the most. The only downside is parking. The last time I went valet was mandatory and felt a little ripped off to pay $3 for someone to park my car three feet from the valet stand. Oh well!  Can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I came here on Thursday before my company and I were going to head to LGO for dinner. I have been wanting to try this place for awhile now since I have been hearing and reading great things through yelp. I mean how great can panini's and bruschetta actually be? More on that later.  The actual building itself was pretty cool. A nice chill vibe that wasn't overbearing with pretentiousness. Always a breath of fresh air. What kills this place is the crowd. I showed up about 2 PM. and the crowd was casual and just having a good time. As the time got later the typical Arcadia yuppie / trendy crowd began coming in. Totally killing the atmosphere. I don't know why so many people in Scottsdale and Phoenix are like this, I don't get it. It's not attractive, you look like douche bags. I swear it seems as though there is a clan of people on yelp all yelping together to write great reviews, because it's what they like, so gay.  OK, now for this food review, it's strictly for the bruschetta's. Honestly I don't know why people praise somethings. I tasted four of them. Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil. Tomato Jam and fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese. Burrata, Bacon, Arugula, and Tomatoes. And Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Let me get one thing clear, they all tasted good, and yes some were more impressive than others, but come on it's a slice of bread with a topping, not really a culinary masterpiece. Although I will give props to the Tomato jam, that was delicious!  As an all around value of Postino, you really can't go wrong. The prices match what these items should be priced at, and solid drink deals. I would definitely go back if fellow friends suggest going there, but I don't think I would go out of my way to come back here.   But with all this being said, they have 2 locations and are opening up a third one.  So props to the owners, they have marketed a concept and people are loving it so they're doing something right in many people's opinions.",

I didnt get the Monday special, but even so the wine was 30 for a bottle and another 30 for food. Valet was 3. Reasonable.  Romantic wine bar delievered and I took the girl home to seal the deal.

Taking something so simple (Brushetta, A Cheese Plate, Soups) and turning them into \"works of art\" is an art in itself. Have eaten mostly everything on the menu at one time or another and am NEVER disappointed. They even changed my mind about liking brie - well of course their \"Triple Cream Brie\" had a lot to do with that - heavenly!  Their Brushetta, in addition to being beautiful to look at is absolutely FABULOUS Haven't had one I didn't like, in spite of the fact I am NOT all that fond of Smoked Salmon or Tuna, but loved their preparation!  Did I mention the \"Grilled Cheese?\"   Don't ask - JUST ORDER IT!   $6? Are they nuts?   No, it is worth it!  Kind of what I think each time I order it!  Lots of fun to have many for a great selection with several people sharing. Probably ALL but the soups should be shared and even the soups can be, if you are with someone you really care about!  Go, don't wait! Wonderful for lunch, nice for a casual dinner and the wait staff is generally terrific!",

It's more of a wine bar than a restaurant and the menu reflects that - with the heaviest of items being their paninis.  The autostrada panini comes loaded with several meats (soppresatta and prosciutto among them) and cheeses and is amazing.  UPDATE - Great service just recently.  A bit of a wait, but forgot about it because of the great servers - Michelle I think, was one of them.  Just had a Tobin syrah that was incredible...",

Of course, I was right about these concerns when I actually tried the place.  However....that doesn't mean that it can't be enjoyed with the right company.  The wine choices are unbeatable and they have a great app menu, of which I highly recommend the bruchetta (you can choose different several different toppings for one order and they were all equally delicious).  It's a great place to chat with friends, or go on a weeknight to grab some vino.  I'm not dying to go back anytime soon, so it's not a favorite for me.  However, I can see how some people would make this wine bar a regular stop.",

The wine selection however  is good, there should be no problem finding something you like  To boil it down, we have a decent meal with a good wine selection, in a super trendy place to eat... Perfect for people who care more about appearances than food.  That being said you should try Postino out, it is fun and maybe you will think the food more inspired than I did.",

The atmosphere, the food, and the wine all measure up at Postino, the place that started the uber-urban renaissance at 40th and Campbell.  Postino is upscale, but not pretentious. The bruschetta really is out of this world, but the salads are incredible, too. Went there for lunch on a Friday and loved the diversity of the crowd. I also liked it that the noise level was reasonable, even when the place was packed.",

    "text": "One of my favorite places of Phoenix!  Although I often clown on Scottsdale and their wannabe NYC / SF spots, Postino's is definitely a place I will return to on my next visit to the desert.  Set in an old, renovated Post Office, the dark decor and hundreds of candles set the mood. We were fortunate enough to score the large couch set into the  corner of the cafe when another party didn't show. Our server was fantastic, and the manager was extremely helpful with our wine selection.  Des and I had a bottle of their house Cab, Pennyfarthing, which was so good we bought a bottle to go! We also had a sampler of their famous bruschetta, which was exquisite! The boast a variety of bruschettas, and we tried 4 of them; apple/date/brie, tomato/mozzarella/basil, salami/pesto, and classic.  Unbelievable!!!",

    "text": "Postino has really evolved their restaurant for the better over the past 5 or so years since I began going there.  Their wine list has always been, current, going with the latest trends in grapes ... from Cabs in the early 00s, to Pinots in 03-04, and now featuring Malbec and Tempranillos.    While this is slightly frustrating as a wine (whine?) snob, i have to give it up to Postino for making available the varietals that people like me want to drink when they're spending $11 a glass at a wine bar.  I'll always pretty much have a soft spot for this place, as it was the site of some magical shit between me and my gf (Iknow, I'm romantic) on our first ever date.  So, if you ever need an idea for a first date, or a 50th date, this is your spot.  My favorite thing on their menu is the Bruschetta board (and please say the freaking word right), and all of their choices of toppings.  Mmmm, Brie and Granny Smith apples, Mmmm, prosciutto, Mmmm, white tuscan beans ... etc  This place gets super packed to the point of claustrophobia, so thats my only minor annoyance ... oh and the smoking area that is nearly in Peoria.",

My favorite things: $20 night, although Mon and Tue after 8 are busier than a weekend up in here, be prepared to wait and get drunk; brushetta in all it's glory - always fresh, always perfect; the ever changing wine list, always fun to try them all and order for others; the soups in winter; the prosciutto and brie sandwhich, I die.  One more confession, I actually picked my current condo because of it's proximity to Postino.  Less than a mile.  Sold.  xx",

    "text": "Imagine if you took an Italian deli and dressed it up and put the sandwhiches on menus instead of a chalkboard and provided mood lighting and had a metrosexual waitstaff bring the sandwhiches to your table.  That's essentially Postino in a nutshell.  It's next to the ever trendy La Grande Orange which just adds to its hype.  Seriously, I could start serving twinkies and pbj's  next to La Grande Orange and i would have 91 reviews with 4 stars too.  The food was unspectacular as I felt like I was eating lunch but paying 3 times for it.  The service was average. The waitstaff was not rude but they were not helpful either as we had to constantly remind them to bring items; they took nearly 20 minutes to take our order and you had to ask them for anything extra like water or silverware.  It just seemed like the owner walked into Six lounge and asked some people to be servers; they just seemed as if they had no experience waiting on people.   Furthermore, it's not a \"winecafe.\"  It's just a cafe. The wine part makes it sound trendier than it is. The wine selection is a joke and there are hardly any \"by the glass\" selections. The servers have no clue about wine and if you ask them a few questions, you will see they do a really good job trying to b.s. you but if you have any knowledge about wine like I do, you enjoy the spectacle of seeing them trying to sound intelligent: \"Er, do you like white or red wine\"   The food was good but again, why am I paying a lot of money to be served this for dinner. There are several panini Italian lunch delis that i could get this same food at.   This is a great place for a light meal or a cocktail or a great place for friends to meet at for a quick drink before heading out to the clubs or lounges.  It's also a great place to impress a date (if you are less than 25 years old).  However, Postino should not be viewed as serious fare in regards to dining.  I would say Postino was a nice experience but I certainly wouldn't return unless I was meeting a group of people there.",

We found this \"wine bar\" not far from our hotel and thought what a great way to wind down the evening.  We arrived a little after 9pm and the wait was 20 minutes. (I now know that they have specials on Tuesday nights!)  Anyway, the place was a mad house!  And it seemed to me more like a restaurant that sold wine by the glass rather than a traditional wine bar where you could taste and sample different wines.  I tried a temparnillo and the other girls had a verdejo and a chenin blanc.  All were fair, but nothing spectacular.  I just enjoy a little education about the wine, region, winemaker, etc. when I'm trying something new.  Postino did however, have a very cool contemporary design and a great atmosphere.  It seemed like the hip place to hang for the mid 20's to 30's set!  I'll definitely give it another try, next time I'm in Phoenix.",

The happy hour is fantastic any day ($5 glasses of wine?! can't beat that) Postinos is probably the main reason we didn't want to move away from Phoenix. It's a great date place with a great atmosphere. It can get quite crowded so, go early. But even if you have to wait, I still think it's worth it. There is no bad seat in the house. Parking can be annoying, but they do have valet. We usually parked on a side street near by (but be careful, some of the side streets you can't park on). Both locations are just as good.

Food and wine are always great. However, the music is questionable. My last time at Central was for lunch; they were playing rap. Really? Rap at lunch??? But I have to give them points because once we questioned the choice in music, they changed the selection. My after work business meeting at Arcadia wasn't about the choice of music but the volume.  The place was packed ( which says a lot for the place) but the music was SO loud you couldn't hear yourself think.  People trying to have conversations were having to yell over the music.   Note to Postino's - your food is great, you are busy all the time, Why do you have to drown out people's conversations with overly loud music?",

Postino has a great selection of wine and the epic bruschetta menu is fitting of the parking experience-- long, complicated, and worth the wait.  I deducted a star because I find that the selection of other food lacks variety.  For example, they offer many salads that are terribly similar.  Yes, I know there are only so many variations on a salad but these just all blend together and become forgettable.  If you're going for wine and cheese and bruschetta, you won't be disappointed.

We have been to the Monday/Tuesday 8pm special before and that gets extremely busy. Make sure you arrive a little before 8 and you will probably wait a bit for a table but it's worth it! A board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20... can't beat that anywhere! Maybe one of the best aspects of this restaurant is that they do not upcharge bottles of wine 90% like many others do.

    "text": "Good food and wine, especially on a weekday before 5 pm ($5 wine).   First, if you're going to call yourself a wine cafe, have a good selection of wine to choose from. I think The Cheesecake Factory has a wine list with more variety. With that being said, I did find a couple of good wines to quaff on a 97 degree day, and the service from the bartender was great.  Second, if you're going to attempt to be a quasi-Italian restaurant, play good music. The music wasn't totally offensive, but it certainly didn't match the ambiance.  Now for the food. This place clearly prides itself on their bruschetta. Here are the 4 that I chose:  Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese  Smoked Salmon with Pesto Ricotta, Dates and Pistachios Traditional with Tomato, Basil and Mozzarella  The bread they use is excellent. Perfect for bruschetta. My favorite was the salmon, and the roasted pepper one was quite delicious. I even enjoyed the dates and pistachio bruschetta, but probably wouldn't order it again.  Traditional brushcetta is an appetizer for which I measure any Italian restaurant. The fresh bruschetta here was way too salty, could hardly taste the fresh tomato and basil, which appeared to be fresh and of good quality. Why would you over-salt fresh brushcetta? Major fail, and one of the reasons this place is getting 3 stars instead of 4.   I may come here again though, I just know not to order the fresh bruschetta.",

Mon and Tue they have the special where you get a bottle of wine and bruschetta for $20.  This is a great deal.  The place was crowded so if you go make sure you go early and get your name in.  The nice thing is that you can start drinking your bottle while you wait.  We were waiting for around 45 min before we got a table but we were having fun nonetheless.  The bruschetta was amazing and there were many different types to choose from.  We also tried the grilled cheese which was delightful.  We will definitely be back again and I am excited to try more things on the menu.",

    "text": "It's a Postino, which means it is quality.    I usually go to Postino on Mondays or Tuesdays for the $20 bottle of wine and board of bruschetta deal.  The problem?  So does everyone else!    At this location, there is often a long wait.  It is not bad in the cooler months, but in the Summer it can be unbearable.    I've noticed that a good attitude gets you everywhere here.  If you're sour, expect a longer wait.  I don't know that there is a formula to that, but it seems to have rung True on every occasion.  :)  My favorite wine here is their Tempranillo, though honestly I cannot remember the name or the year for the life of me.    My favorite bruschetta is the ricotta and fig.  It has pistachios, which I am slightly \"sensitive\" to, but I like the saltiness they add.  If I wasn't splitting the bruschetta with anyone, I would order a WHOLE BOARD of ricotta and fig.  Yum.  I also like their paninis and their pub board.  The pub board is about $12 (if I recall correctly) and it has cornichons, pretzel bread, corn nuts and cheese.  The corn nuts are so yummy!  And the cornichons!  And the cheese!  The bread?  Meh.  This location is considerably louder than Postino Central.  I have noticed this on EVERY visit.  Are the patrons different perhaps?  Not sure.  But having a conversation here requires near-shouting or leaning in VERRRRY close (which is not a negative IMHO).  4 stars because the parking situation here is a nightmare.",

My husband got the B.E.L.T. panini and we both agreed it it needed a bit crustier bread and some melty, stringy cheese. The service is super friendly and non-pretentious, which is a pleasant surprise considering the hipster vibe... I usually expect a too-cool-for-school feeling from establishments with lots of beards and flannel. Overall, it was delicious and fun! Give her a go!!",

    "text": "We decided to visit this place while in the area based on all of the strong reviews from our fellow Yelpers.  We went on a Sunday afternoon (right around 12pm) and had no issues with parking.  We scored a spot in front of the restaurant just as someone else was leaving.  The place was fairly busy and our party of two was immediately seated at a low table in the front (right by the acoustic musician).  Postino was well decorated and has a ton of seating options.  We wanted to fall in love with this place but just ended up liking it slightly.   We ordered the butchers block and the bruschetta plus cucumber lemonade and iced tea.  While everything was okay, I wasn't knocked out of my socks.  My favorite part ended up being the butchers block rather than the bruschetta.  I think the issue that they have is that it is not crispy enough.  The bread was under-toasted and it made for a very chewy experience.  We ordered the Salmon pesto (the smoke flavor is weak and the pesto is strong so it misses there), Burratta, bacon, arugula and tomato (while our waitress claimed this to be her favorite, we were underwhelmed here too.  The bulk of the flavor came from the bacon and the arugula), tomato, basil and mozzarella (my favorite combo done wrong!  There was NO flavor to this and they should have at least provided an olive oil or balsamic drizzle to give it some pop.  The tomatoes weren't fully ripe either and were at the pink stage so they hadn't developed their True tenderness) and Prosciutto, fig and marscapone (by far our favorite since the flavor profile gave us a little bit of sweat, savory and salty).  All-in-all the place wasn't bad.  Based on the reviews though I just expected a wee bit more from my experience here.  I liked that they have live entertainment on the weekend although it makes it hard to hear when you are seated to close.  I saw some folks sitting outside although I am not sure of how they survived in 110 degree weather.  On cooler nights though, I can see that being a nice place to hang.  Oh, I also didn't appreciate having to battle flies for my food.  They kept the door open which meant every critter wanted to beat the eat and join the tables.   Not sure about returning as I've had this food concept before except with better execution.",

I do wish the salmon would come with something other than pesto.. maybe herbed cream cheese? It just tasted like it was missing something.  My husband got the peppers with goat cheese, which he loved.   I love brie, so I was determined to try the prosciutto with brie panini. I was so impressed.

Postino has got to be one of the busiest places in town on Monday and Tuesday nights because of their killer $20-for-a-bottle-of-wine-and-bruschetta deal from 8-11 p.m. They're busy every other night, too, simply because they're one of the hippest places around-a hot staff, a huge wine selection, a pretty patio, wonderful food and pretty ambiance. There's also a location in central Phoenix, which offers up all of the same.  When I went there for dinner, I had one of my favortie paninis, the Nine Iron ($9.50), which came with a small side salad and was topped with tomato, mustard and mozzarella. It's very filling and tastes super-fresh, and the regular one comes with chicken and bacon, too.  My pal got the Italian Picnic salad ($8.50) and Tomato Jam and Sheep's Milk bruschetta ($12.75). This was the first time I tried that type of bruschetta (my favorites are the White Bean with Chopped Tomato and Warm Artichoke Spread), and I thought it was amazing-really sweet, and it could even work for dessert.",

BRUSCHETTA:  - brie and apples with fig spread - smoked salmon with pesto - mozzarella with tomato and basil - burrata, bacon, arugula, and tomato  PANINI: - autostrada  hands down the highlights are the brie and apples bruschetta and smoked salmon. the apple brus was crispy from the apples, sweet and the body of the flavor was excellent. the smoked salmon was blended perfectly well with the texture and flavor of the pesto. the best part was the bread. in the bay area, the best bread i've come across is acme bread. this bread is VERY close and if i didn't know any better i would have mistaken the two. the exterior of the bread holds together well and is very thin. the interior of the bread is just strong enough to hold in one hand with all the ingredients on top but soft and fluffy on the bite, making it easy to take a clean bite from the bread. our second stop after that was to get more bread and pastries from mj bread who is their supplier of course.   the servers were around but they didn't hang around u so much that u thought they were invading ur space. they would frequently walk by just to see if ur doing ok. i'm guessing we got very lucky because i overheard the servers talking about how it's usually crowded by the time we walked in. lucky us. =D   if u get a chance u should definitely eat here. great service, price, food, and the environment is well designed for inside and outside seating. we ate at 6 other places and this was the best and most memorable one. if i'm ever in town again, u can bet i'll be here.",

They had a nice selection of $5 wines and pitchers of premium beers. For $5 you really can't go wrong, but despite the low price the quality of everything I had was fantastic.   You must also try their bruschetta. We tried a selection of them and they were all amazing. My favorite was the goat cheese with roasted peppers. The service was great throughout, especially since we took up a prime table for about 4 hours. Our goal was to taste everything and we almost did it before our flight!

I wound up feeling like an idiot for talking it up so much.  We got seated quickly, and were given water.  The waiter asked us if we'd like drinks while waiting for my partner, and I ordered an iced tea. That was the second to last time we saw him.    10 minutes later, still waiting for my partner, and for my iced tea.  Finally, she showed up, and he came back to take our order. Still no iced tea -- he told me it was on the way.  We ordered.  My soup came out first (I had wanted it WITH my grilled cheese), and finally, 30 minutes after having sat down, I got my iced tea.  The food, as always, was amazing. The veg friendly broccoli cheddar soup was soup-er tasty (haha...sorry, it's early), and as usual, the bruschetta and paninis were good too.  The problem arouse when we wanted to leave. My bestie wanted a box for her other half of her sandwich, and our server was no where to be found. Upon further look, he was seated at a table at the back of the restaurant. Now, when I used to work in the service industry, even if you were going on break, you'd either finish your tables first, or hand them to another server and let your tables know. He did neither.  We flagged down not one, not two, but THREE different people trying to get a box and our bill.  The table next to us, who sat after us, got both their dessert AND their bill before we could even get ours. All three people we asked said they'd bring box and bill right out; no dice.  FINALLY, we got the bill. It took another 5 or 6 minutes to get the cards back to sign.  My friend, while she loved the food, was surprised I'd recommended a place with such poor service.  I explained it had never been that way before.  Regardless, it's going to be a little while before I go back; I don't usually have 90+ minutes to waste.",

    "text": "I've been a fan of LGO for years and yet had never been to Postino's.  On this trip to Phoenix, my friend J thought it was a must to experience Postino! We arrived around 8pm and thought it best to use the valet.  We were so happy that we were able to get a table.  Postino's is absolutely darling.  Our server recommended an earthy red wine that J took advantage of and loved.  I had the sparkling Sauvignon Blanc (delightful!) and our friend R had Framboise.  This is a wine and beer place, so those hoping for other spirits are out of luck.  For those that love wine... this is an excellent place to spend some quality time.  Fabulous wine selection!   As for the food... we were happy with everything we ordered except one thing, which I will save for the end of my review.  Postino regulars recommend the bruschetta and everyone seems to have a different favorite.  This is a fun food to order because you are able to choose 4 of the selections.  Fun decision to make with so many great selections!  My top two faves were 1. bacon, arugula and tomatoes (loved this combo!) and 2. warm artichoke spread (excellent!).  R + J loved the prosciutto w/figs and mascarpone.  So highlight of our night was the fun and delicious bruschetta! We also shared olives (meh) and the prosciutto panini.  I enjoyed the panini but my dining partners were crazy about it.   The best and worst of the night were our desserts.  We couldn't decide which one to order, so we got two.  One rocked our world and the other was ho-hum.  The Creme Brulee was the BEST Creme Brulee I have tasted.  Beyond words delish!  The Chocolate Bouchon was not noteworthy.  As my friend Beti would say, \"It wasn't worth the calories.\"   I may have mentioned the word \"fun\" a few times in this review but that is such a perfect description of Postino.  If I lived in Phoenix, you would positively catch me here on a Monday or Tuesday night for their amazing $20 house bottle of wine and bruschetta special.  Oh and the Creme Brulee!",

Our best friends told us that this place in the Arcadia district was now serving Brunch from 9AM and to check it out.  We arrived like 9:15AM with much apprehension as we were the only couple in the place.  The menu was limited but looked decent.  Oh My Goodness!  My wife ordered the Ciabatta French Toast.  Now she claims to just hate Ciabatta bread, but she was not in the mood for eggs.  ***** That was the 5-star rating she gave the dish as it was (as she admitted) the best French Toast she ever tasted.  I on the other hand always go for the biggest dish, so I ordered their Farm Scramble - Eggs, potatoes, onions,  \"secret\"  herbs of some sort and two kinds of cheese.  It came with a  salad of mixed greens and cherry tomatoes.  I had to take the salad even though I don't \"ever\" have salad for breakfast.  I moved the salad to one side and licked off the fork .... The best tasting dressing I had tasted in years.  So I finished off the salad (that I never eat) and dug into the eggs ... Yum Yum Yum, I now have a new favorite breakfast dish.  You want a Mimosa to go with the meal?  Order  up.  We are going back this Sunday with our friends and I would highly recommend it to everyone.  A couple at another table told us that if we thought that the Brunch was good, we should come in for dinner as those meals were out of this world.  Oh .... by 9:45AM every seat in the restaurant was occupied.",

It's a great place for any occasion really... My sister and I ordered the bruschetta and split a panini and the food was most definitely AMAZING in every sense of the word. The  burst of flavors was exactly what I was looking for and totally hit the spot! If I had not had to be up at the crack of dawn the next morning I would have definitely split a bottle of wine with sis but we didn't have much time and were just wanting a bite to eat.

If you don't order the bruschetta, shoot yourself. K don't do that. ALL of them are delicious. DEF pass on the Tuscan bean though (mush), and the Mozz Tom Basil is pretty plain. MY TIP! Order the Chopped Tom and Pesto and ADD mozzerella. BOOM! Soooo good we order double of that everytime. Original...yes and perfection...yes. I could give details on more of the choices, but really ALL of them are wonderful, so order up. And don't worry about their \"Choose 4\" you can do whatever combination you want, pretty much a la carte.  Panini's are awesome for lunch too. LOVE the Chick & Mozz, and if you're up for something a little more rich try the Prosciutto with Brie.  Only a couple small issues. 1. wish they would upate their seasonal more often or rotate some new ones in once in awhile. 2. would like a little more of a selection on their by the glass wine options. 3. add some more Spanish wines por favor!  The set it up is awesome. Clean and open, nice patio seating, cool corner booth table for larger parties. Great music! Contemporary little accents all around. Sometimes a little wait, but no big deal. We're there a couple times a month!",

There's nothing quite like this in Ann Arbor, which is too bad. There are some great places here, and even a couple of nice places to sip wine, but the feel of Postino is totally different.  The warm weather enables the front of the cafe to be pretty much totally open (nice garage doors), and though that's not something that would work too well in Michigan in the winter, I have a feeling the the wine selection and food quality offered by Postino would go over famously here in Ann Arbor and elsewhere.  I'm not into big chains, but maybe they'd consider a satellite location?  The bruschetta is a dream -- perfect to share with a group. I especially enjoyed the roasted pepper with goat cheese; brie, apple and fig spread; and the wonderfully salty roasted artichoke heart versions.  And of course, I enjoyed the wine.  In warm weather, I'm a white wine kind of gal, so I sipped a nice glass of Pinot Grigio. I was totally charmed by both the food and the company. Oh, and extra charm points for playing some Otis Redding. The service was just fine -- attentive without being intrusive. If they can't open a Michigan location, then I guess I'll just have to come back the next time I'm around Phoenix.",

Now this doesn't mean the service was bad, the food was mediocre, the wine selection limited, the decor unpleasant. It wasn't any of those descriptives. It simply wasn't above above average.  I went there on a weekday night, late, and had a dinner date. We were seated next to the wine selection since we ended up at the tail-end of the busy dinner time of Postinos. The place is really beautiful-well designed, warm, full of sophisticated, cultivated people tinkling upscale laughter. There aren't much options for the lactose intolerant vegetarian, so I went with the bruschetta sampler. And while it was tasty, I wasn't quite blown away. The combinations were good...but is it really good date food to chew on crispy crunchy bread loaded with crap that falls off all over the place?  The wine selection is overwhelming, but was pleased with the server who helped us out on a bold, juicy cab in a reasonable (read: cheap) bottle.  I really liked the look of the bar and if I went back here probably would hit that up with wine and maybe some dessert after dinner somewhere else.  This place is beautiful. The patio especially looks elegant and reclusive enough for your next affair. But the ambiance is just off. I can't quite put my finger on it, but it seems to lack a kind of personality or quirk. Kind of like when you visit a perfectionist's home and it feels rather cool or crisp, but then you love your messy, quirky friends home b/c you can relax and not use a coaster.   It is a perfect date place...but in a rather generic way. This place, in fact, SCREAMS date place. I imagine it was booked for upcoming valentine's day back on Feb. 15, 2006....which to me, just isn't any fun.",

For my recent birthday dinner, I chose Postinos because of all the wonderful things people have written before me.  I love the atmosphere most, and the food is a close second.  Upon calling for a reservation, I was told that a manager would call me back to confirm the reservation.  I thought this was strange, but went along with it.  The manager called me shortly, but told me that she needed my credit card number in order to hold the table.  I have never been asked to do this before, and felt strange about it but did it anyway.  Dinner was great-our waitress was attentive and it was a great experience.  However, about two hours in, the hostess came over and was quite rude to us about how reservations have a two hour cap on them.  I was a bit confused by this, as we were a party of ten and I was never told this very strange stipulation when the manager was taking down my credit card number.  It didn't sit well with me because the hostess was pretty rude to us, and it has left a bad taste in my mouth.  Just something to keep in mind when making reservations there.",

However, I had a less than pleasant experience at this restaurant on my Birthday & I was very upset & disappointed. Why I give them 5 stars is, because the District Manager himself replied to my Comment & was humble enough to apologize profusely on behalf of his staff & put it right. I did say I would never go to this restaurant again, however much I loved the food there. But Mr.Cox was so nice, that I couldn't even be angry for too long. He made it special & thanked me for giving them a 2nd chance to do things right. I didn't expect anything or even expect anyone to read or reply to my comment. I was so touched when The District Manager himself had replied the very next Day. I will certainly go back & I thank Mr.Cox for being so kind to me. Your Kind words meant so much, at a time I was so sad & upset. This world needs more people like you. Your staff is so lucky to have you, & if they decide to take you as an example, I am sure the Manager who was there that night, would learn to be nicer to his customers & not laugh at them. I appreciate Your kindness & Your way of making someone feel better. It means a lot. Thank you very much.",

    "text": "Oh heck yes.  I really like Postino.  The atmosphere is laid back (the dress ranged from t-shirts and shorts to sun dresses and collared shirts) the wines are good and the food is really good.  I do wish the wine list was more extensive though, especially for a wine bar.  The service is really friendly and attentive, although my husband didn't really go for the wine our server suggested to him.   The bruschetta is fantastic and the cheese plate is ginormous.  Its good to try to get there a little early (think 4pm or earlier) because it does filly up and the parking lot is tiny.  (Or you can fork over the $3 for valet)   Seriously though, I think it must be the tiniest parking lot in Arizona, its like something you'd find in Boston!\\  Update:  I chose to have my birthday dinner at Postino because I wanted something casual and fun.  Postino fits the bill.  I called and made a reservation for 12 which was no problem.  (They did take my credit card information which I am totally used to doing for large groups)  We arrived and were seated promptly with great service throughout the night.  I was told when I made the reservation that if I wanted to bring in cake there would be a cutting charge but I could bring in something from Tammie Coe with no extra charge.  I purchased cupcakes and completely forgot about them until we were at Merc Bar later that night!  I called Postino and they were nice enough to hold them for me (again- they had held them from when Tammie Coe closed that afternoon until our reservation)  and I was able to get them the next day.  Cupcakes for breakfast!  I've eaten here several times now and I'm never dissapointed....not in the bruschetta or the salads.  One day I'll try a sandwich I'm sure....if only the bruschetta wasn't so yummy!",

I recently visited Postino with two friends and had the Bruschetta -- we selected the Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato and Basil, the Smoked Salmon and the Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. Thumbs up on all of these yummy appetizers! The clientele is a hip, diverse crowd reflective of its gentrified, charming neighborhood of mid-century ranch homes, and yet just a hop from the Biltmore and Arcadia neighborhoods. Ah... Phoenix is growing up! Wish I knew more about wines to tell you more about that. It appeared to be a nice selection and there were bottles you can buy to take home as well. Parking is a challenge, however I will definitely be back. <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.postinowinecafe.com%2F&s=8c92d3ff661fa1d8ebae278d15e5d170888224cbf7bc3d3c0bb9aacb47037cb7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">postinowinecafe.com</a>  Update: Postino's is one of many restaurants/bars in AZ that permits concealed weapons without permits and is noted on the Arizona State Rifle and Pistol Association in their CCW Cafe page: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.asrpa.com%2Fccwcafe.html&s=835758ed6e13987a734e98cfc8628b9fb1cd910fc9c9a7569d23010cd47a39f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">asrpa.com/ccwcafe.html</a> For that reason I am reducing the previously 5-star rating to 1-star.",

We also ordered a vegetarian panini and a turkey one with romain salad.  We were so full after the bruschetta.  I managed to finish half of my sandwich and the salad.  The panini's are fine, not amazing, but yummy.  I think next time I'm in town I'll have the bruschetta and a salad.   What's nice is they let my well-behaved dog join us on the patio.",

We arrived before 8pm to get a table (around 7:40), as it gets packed at 8pm for this deal on Monday & Tuesday. The waitress was great about asking for our wine + bruschetta order before 8pm so that she could put the order in right at 8 when the deal started. The bruschetta, by the way, is pretty massive and awesome. You get to choose 4, and each one is the size of a small brick.  We sat outside and the weather was pretty nice. Plenty of outdoor heaters just like everywhere else here--but living on Ohio I have no idea why they run when it's over 55 degrees :)  I would definitely go back and try some of the other menu items.",

I have been quite a few times and I find that the lunch time spread is better than dinner for some reason. Usually they're pretty packed no matter what time of day I visit, but for some reason my plate always seems to be better looking and more plentiful at lunch time, than when I have gone at dinner time. Either way, the food is amazing, I always get the bruschetta- the mascarpone fig is my favorite, the almond hummus comes in second, and the pesto salami third. SO GOOD. I've visited a few times with friends who have gotten a panini and the verdict always seems to be \"meh, it was okay\". I think when you come here the thing to order is the bruschetta if you don't want to be disappointed and trust me you wont be.   They also do $5 dollar pitchers (small) and $5 glasses of wine till 5pm and you can't go wrong with that! The service here has always been great, will definitely be back. They also have an outdoor patio which is my favorite and i always request to sit outside, it also seems to be dog friendly.",

Sometimes they have live music here. Always a plus...love live music, I wished more places did this.   Anyhow besides the snooty staff, this place is pretty cool.   I'd give it five stars if I looked like I walked out of a JCrew catalog or if  had the latest thrift store Macklemore look going on, maybe I could relate better to the staff...but I grew out of that trendy shit in like 2004. I look like I came from the gym when I come here...and I just assume the staff assumes I have no money and give me attitude.   I just don't care. But still a good time.",

    "text": "This place has an amazing selection of wines and he bruschetta is delicious! We ended up ordering a bottle of wine and two bruschetta platters for 3 people.  The white bean one was delicious! Definitely one of my favorites! The apple and Brie was on the sweeter side, the mozzarella and tomato was also good, on the simple side.  The bacon and tomato was a superb flavor and the prosciutto and fig was also good.  I think the one with pesto was also wonderful and may have been my second favorite! The bread was soft, wish it was a little crispier but it makes for easy eats cause it's not hard to bite into! They also cut each bruschetta into quarters so it's easy to share all the different ones! Great for a wine night and bites where you just want to hang out and chat! The atmosphere is also good.. Very dark and candlelit inside and there are misters on the outside to keep it semi cool!",

We used to look forward to your potato chips that came with the sandwich. They were thick, well seasoned, almost like freshly cut potatoes.  The new chips you added are worse than ruffles. At least get Tim's or something close. Posinos is a special, artisan  restaurant and can do much better. All of your food is well made. The chips take up half the plate and represent 1/4 the meal. The devil is in the details. These new, hard, unflavored chips are a disservice to customers and the meal. They detract and are a waste of space, they may be cheaper but we noticed and were disappointed. Bring the old chips back.",

Try to make it during the time they have the special for a bottle of wine and bruschetta board for $20. If you are reading this review right now you probably have the ability to find out when that is, so do it, because I can't remember.   The Bruschetta board comes with 4 types of bruschetta, you have to order this. I have tried all of them and each is great in its own way but, you must have the Brie & Apples - to die for.   Get the Nine Iron panini.   The cheese board is my favorite appetizer.   Any or all of that with a Hop Knot and you might just forget you are on planet Earth.",

They have the best deal in town. $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta on Monday and Tuesday starting at 8pm. $5 dollar glass of wine deals all the other days.  I've also had their breakfast sandwich and salads. I hope they open one closer to North Scottsdale.",

My favs are the white bean, the apple/brie, and the fig. $5 glasses of wine from 11-5 pm.  Say whaaat?   Yup.  However, today I branched out and *didn't* get bruschetta. Say it isn't so.... I got the Tuscan Tuna panini.  I don't know how you make tuna taste sinful, but they did.  This is fresh, high quality tuna on either a ciabatta or foccacia. I opted for the ciabatta.  Delish!!  Seriously though... what the heck do they DO to that tuna?  I never get this jazzed about tuna. ;) You get a choice of chips or salad and I opted for the salad. Simple, light, with a touch of goat cheese. I actually had to take half my sandwich home because it was so big. Yay for branching out!  Did I mention I loved the tuna?",

The place we initially planned on eating lunch at was closed on Sundays so we picked Postino after a quick Yelp search. So clutch!  Postino has the craziest deal (which we unfortunately didn't avail of because we weren't in the mood for alcohol): $5 glasses of wine or PITCHERS of beer until 5PM every day of the week. Honestly a steal, in my opinion. I'd be here frequently if I lived in the area.  My mom, brother and I stopped in for lunch with empty stomaches so we were ready to feast! Waited a quick ten minutes before being seated. Shortly after, we got a board of bruschetta to share and each ordered \"Select Two\" for our entrees. My mom and I got Arnold Palmers to drink which really hit the spot - free refills, too!  The warm artichoke spread and the burrata, bacon, arugula & tomato selections are a MUST if you order a bruschetta board.   For entree, I ordered 1/2 of the chicken & mozzarella sandwich on *focaccia* bread and 1/2 of the \"soup of the moment.\" The soup I had was tomato based (I believe) with corn, mixed vegetables, rice and chicken - yum! The focaccia bread was toasted beautifully and the sandwich was packed with flavor. My brother got two halves of different sandwiches while my mom got half a sandwich and a salad. We were all so satisfied with the meal!  Service was great, everyone was so warm and welcoming. Wish I had a Postino in Jersey for me to frequent!",

T H E    B A D - If I had to pick something negative to say, I will say the wine seems slightly overpriced, but the food is reasonable, so it balances out.

I mean, the food (bruschetta boards obviously), beer & wine (especially during HH) are fantastic.  From an atmosphere standpoint I think this is my favorite location (I believe it's the original?). I can't put my finger on why exactly, but it just seems to have a more homey/inviting vibe (there's a part of the restaurant where they have couches). It's kind of right in the thick of the neighborhood here, so that might be part of the reason why it feels this way.  That being said, it also (seems to be) one of the smaller locations and can get crowded.   Still, I love it, love Postino & will be back!",

I heard about Postino from a few friends and of course, Yelp, so we made it there for New Years Day brunch before catching our flight.   We sat outside because the weather was amazing. The outdoor patio is a great place for wonderful vibes, a nice view and good service.   This location is in a neighborhood and definitely would be a frequent stop for me if I lived nearby. Tons of people coming in to buy wine to go because you can and it's $9 off bottles!  We ordered the Farmer's Scramble and the Roast Beef Panini (on ciabatta).   Both were outstanding! The Scramble was so moist, cheesy and earthy. And the greens on the side were so simple and tasty.   I ordered a glass of the French Rose and it paired perfectly with the Scramble and the weather.   Service was a tad slower than I hoped and that's why they didn't get a 5 star review. But overall, they seemed to have the flow down.",

Each bruschetta is cut in 1/4 so it's easy to share.   The grilled cauliflower was a great surprise. The sauce is out of this world. Whatever they put on that works perfect. The cauliflower was grilled to a slight crunch.   They only serve beer and wine.   They need a little more lighting- too dim. They are creating the ambience but it's a little too dim.   This was a great treat. Go for the food. You will not be disappointed.",

The drinks, food and service are always excellent. And they play that music I like. Great vibes...  Thank you for being wonderful, Postino Arcadia. I heart you.",

I will say that most of the olives were quite small in size but still tasty. The bruschetta board was delicious as we ordered some of my favorites like the 'warm artichoke' and the 'fresh mozzarella/tomato' bruschetta. They have made some changes to the menu but everyone at our table was pleased with their choices. The only complaint I have is that the night was quite chilly and they had all their doors/windows open which made the temperature inside a little more colder than it needed to be. Other than that, lovely experience as always!! Wine was also great!",

Misters, shade, cozy tables and tons of added greenery to create a private space to have a snack. This specific trip we stopped just to have their bruschetta board. We got an assortment of different flavors and also got the veggie board too. Both were exactly what we needed. The veggies were fresh. The hummus - I don't know what they did to it but it was divine!    I typically only do water but today I tried the cucumber lemonade and wow talk about refreshing on a hot day. Warning it is not free refills and you will want more so just be ready for that come bill time.   A great relaxing opportunity thanks Postino!",

After 8pm you get a a whole bottle of wine and a whole board of bruschetta for $20 and let me just say that they aren't your average Barefoot or Yellowtail wines. They are nice wines.   Now for the bruschetta because this is the thing I truly believe sets Postino's apart from the majority of restaurants that I've been to in my life. First off, you get to choose 4 from a list of about 10 I believe? They have a seasonal, which is always great. They have ones for people who are meat eaters and for vegetarians like myself. In my personal opinion, the spicy pepper jam and goat cheese and the warm artichoke spread are the best ones by far! Also, to top everything off, they have gluten free bread that actually taste good.  It doesn't stop there either. They have a great brunch, awesome deals on Saturday and Sunday for happy hour, $5 glass of all day until 5 and the paninis are amazing as well. All in all, have no shame and indulge fully into the deliciousness no matter what day of the week!",

Nothing wrong with Salmon , I just don't care for Salmon period, but I'm sure its exquisite.  My husband I split a board with a Mediterranean Salad and Wine . All pairs well with wine or beer .

I did find my service a little odd tonight, given that our server, Jenna, told us we could not split our check when we were ready to pay. My friend also manages a local bar, and we have both used all of the common POS systems, so I'm unsure how us splitting a check was not possible. Her reaction was also very bothered and actually somewhat rude. To accommodate her, I said I would just pay the bill with my card so she didn't have to split anything. But I think the hospitality is supposed to go the other way around. Just saying:)",

The service was super friendly and not in a fake, cheesy, over the top way. The people are real and just as hipster/classy as the establishment. The music, AMAZING. Nothing better than great jams while enjoying yummy food with good company. Everything from Tegan and Sara, Interpol and Broken Bells to Manchester Orchestra. My kinda jams.  The food gets its own category because holy miss moly, this stuff is good. We ordered their bruschetta appetizer where you choose 4 different types of 11 different bruschetta creations they offer. We went with 1-Brie and Apples with Fig Spread, 2-Ricotta with Dates and Pistachio's, 3-White Bean with Chopped Tomato and 4-Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese. FOODGASM. When we ordered this, we were under the impression we were only geting 1 piece of each type of bruschetta that we chose and when it arrived at our table we were pleasantly surprised to see we actually get 4 pieces of each flavor. Lots of food!! Great price point for what you get. Presentation: Rocks, Flavor: Unreal, Price Point: Totally worth it. Because we originally thought the bruschetta was going to be a \"side\" we also ordered the Vegetarian panini with a side Mixed Green salad which was also super delicious. Lets just say we were super full.  The atmosphere here is laid back and beautiful. If you want to dazzle your friends from out of town or take some one on a first date, you can't go wrong with Postino Arcadia.",

We usually get the bruscetta, especially when they're on special (mon and tues), but if you want to branch out, try the pub board, or the butcher block.

To this day, I have never had anything like their bruschetta.  Don't order it as an appetizer; it's definitely a meal.  Large and luscious, sweet and savory, served on a slightly rustic wooden plank, topped with amazing things like apples, soft cheeses, figs, and pistachios.  It's the stuff dreams are made of.  I wish they would hurry up and open the one in Gilbert.  I'm never in Arcadia at the right time anymore.  Also, do not expect to find parking here; you will definitely have to valet.  That's not just a Postino's thing, though, that's an Arcadia thing.",

THAT good, people. i gave up meat for a salad.  as for the atmosphere... yeah, it's loud and dim and trendy (perhaps not the best place for a first date), BUT the waitstaff is really nice, and they were lightning-quick to refill our teeny water glasses with mostly-ice water. but they were so nice about it, that we just smiled as we chewed our ice like thirsty camels. the decor is truly fabulous, and the crowd isn't TOO snobby. the weather is nice enough that walking down the street to park isn't a huge pain. would i go back? definitely. but i'd probably only order the bruschetta. and that side salad...",

I ordered a board of bruschetta, planning to split it with my friend, but then remembered she is unable to have gluten! It was so delicious that I finished the whole board by myself! I just couldn't say no to the brie, apple & fig, or red peppers & goat cheese, or prosciutto, fig & marscapone, or the burrata, bacon, arugula, & tomatoes.

We love all their different options but our favorite is the tomato jam w/ sheeps milk and the burrata bacon w/arugula and tomato. The tomato jam doesn't sound exciting or unique, but it really is! It's a must! My husband and I got turned on to the tomato jam by our server who recommended it, assuring us that we will not be disappointed. She was right, the first bite was so dangerous because we were hooked immediately! The taste is so addicting and the flavor is amazing! The burrata bacon is also amazing, you can't go wrong with bacon and it is everything you will hope for from a bacon bruschetta and more.  We love their happy hour $5 for a pitcher of hoegaarden! However, lately we have been skipping this amazing offer for their honey cucumber lemonade. It is perfect in sweetness, taste, and it is so refreshing!! It makes water incompetent for refreshment and it makes Gatorade look stupid.",

As big wine folks, they know that after the hour and a half drive from Tucson, they just want to relax and have a glass of wine and some bruschetta.  While there isn't a HUGE menu to select from, the bruschetta, soups, salads and paninis are perfectly portioned, amazingly tasty and refreshing, no matter what time of year. Their unique selection of bruschetta includes apple and brie with fig spread, proscuitto with figs and mascarpone and salami with pesto (plus a few others). And their wine list makes up for it. They have an extensive selection that they change out regularly, and you can buy a bottle on your way out to enjoy at home.  My favorite that I discovered at Postinos is the Hey Mambo.  Tucked away in a charming neighborhood in Phoenix, Postinos is a great place to enjoy some wine and bruschetta. They usually do have the garage door open, so you get the fresh outdoors no matter where you sit. When the weather is perfect out, the outdoor seating is great too.  Although 90% of the time you have to valet park due to limited parking, it is only $3 and very convenient. It is probably one of the only places I don't mind valet parking at in Phoenix.",

It wasn't very busy for a Friday night, but I've tried to go here during the day a few times and gave up out of frustration due to the parking situation. It wasn't a problem last night.   The place is beautiful. I really like the decor and the layout. It's comfy and fancy without being too pretentious. It helped that it wasn't at all crowded and that the weather was perfect.   The service was friendly and VERY accomidating for both of our special needs ordering. I was impressed.   I went into this without reading any reviews or knowing much about the place other than that it exists and people like it. I have to be honest here - I wasn't that impressed with the food. It's a simple cafe menu, so perhaps I'm being too critical, but I just didn't love it. It was decent, but not my taste.   The food is good... I'm just not going to go out of my way to eat here. The wine was good though. Maybe they have a larger list somewhere, but the wine list I saw was pretty short - particularly for a wine cafe. Still... what we had was delicious.   My only other gripe was that it was a pretty spendy experience - even with a discount. I much prefer Kasimierz - which is probably an unfair thing to compare it to - but I do. Maybe My Florist would be more appropriate of a comparison, but I haven't been there in years. I think this place is great and has mass appeal... My not being totally on board with it probably says more about my taste than this place.  I would definitely eat and drink here again, and I would recommend it to friends and strangers.",

    "text": "For those of you who know me, or can tell by my reviews, I love love love me some wine! And Postino's is about one of the best places in town to get some. It is difficult for me to venture out away from my usual wine drinking whole.... but I need to through this place back into the rotation more often.   The girls and I had a nice late dinner and wine the other night, to catch up over the Thanksgiving holiday. We had two great bottles of wine, the Malbac and the Teprinillo, a cup of amazing spicy corn chowder, artichoke dip, and the brichetta (apple and brea, smoked salmon and pesto, fig and prosciutto, roasted red pepper and goat cheese). Their brischetta makes my mouth water just thinking about it! Our waitress was awesome! Very nice, and took very good care of us, even though there was a miss-hap with out food, we didn't care, we had wine and it was fun!   We also just found out about a special they have going on Monday and Tuesday's starting at 8pm..... $20 for your choice of brischetta and a bottle of their house wine. (PS: by house wine they mean any bottle that is on the menu!!!)",

    "text": "If you enjoy wine-bars and you don't fall in love with Postino, you're crazy!  The first time I walked into Postino, I felt like I'd stepped into a different world. Having lived in NYC for a while, I became a bit spoiled and was pleasantly surprised to find Postino comparable to places I loved out there!   Nighttime is the best time to go as it's dim, loud and full of energy. Postino is one of my favorite places to go for a light dinner and drinks with good friends year-round; however, on a fall or spring night, when they have all the doors and windows open onto the patio, it's perfection.  As many have mentioned, the bruschetta is great. It's a good option for an appetizer or sharing for a main dish, especially if you'd rather focus on filling up with wine than food. ;) The grilled cheese appetizer is tasty, but a pretty small portion. If you're looking for a small compliment to wine, they've got a \"cheese course\" and a meat and cheese \"plate\". The cheese course comes with 3 different cheeses that they switch up frequently. It's a pretty decently sized dish, but the last time I ordered it, the \"fruit\" they mentioned on the menu was basically just dried apricots, cranberries and nuts. It wasn't bad, but with the crunchy bread it came with, there were too many dry things on one plate for my liking! If you like olives, I'd recommend splurging on the $5 olive bowl. It's a generous portion of mixed olives that will not disappoint.   My all-time favorite item at Postino is the \"Prosciutto with Brie\" Panini, on Ciabatta bread, with salad. The sandwich is soft prosciutto layered with brie, arugula and figs, drizzled with a little balsamic and olive oil and served on a super crunchy ciabatta roll. If this was the only item on the menu, I'd still make the 15 mile drive to order it. The sandwich is big enough to share, but I love it enough to eat the whole thing and suffer the consequences later. :) All of the paninis come with potato chips or salad. Rarely would I choose salad as a side, but I actually look forward to this salad almost as much as the sandwich. It's romaine lettuce, pine nuts, crumbled feta and a very light oil dressing (from what I can gather).   The two negatives, which is what drops it from 5 stars to 4 are the following: The service is often lacking. There are some really nice, attentive servers and there are some rather pretentious servers (which isn't unheard of at a wine-bar). It's really hit or miss, but I take it with a grain of salt and don't let it deter me from going. After all, a pretentious server can become great material for dinner-time laughs.   The second negative is the parking situation. This is an issue with any of the many LA Grande Orange establishments located on that corner. Pretty much any time you go there, you will have trouble finding parking. They do offer valet, but call me cheap, I'd rather not HAVE to pay for valet.   To make a long story short (I know, too late), go to Postino if you're looking for an experience you're unlikely to find anywhere else in Phoenix.",

The quaintness of the surrounding neighborhood, the fact that it is housed in a old post office, the modern, organic ambiance....what can I say (oh, I already did...) I LOVE this place!  The bruschetta flights are fabulous! So diverse and tantilizing to the taste buds when paired with a complimentary glass of wine. My two favorite salads are the Raspberry Chicken and the Mixed Green...both delicious in their own right.   I love that between 11am-4pm ANY day of the week, they offer $5 glasses of wine.  Whether you are dining with a girlfriend, your significant other or a few friends, this is a perfect place to meet. (Just note that this place is packed almost 24/7)   Although the parking is a nightmare, the simple ambiance of this establishment, paired with the phenomenal food/drink, keeps me coming back for more!",

I also ordered for our table the Mozzarella and Tomatoes which was really tasty and was the perfect size appetizer.  I ordered my fave, The Autostrada, which was perfect, and the bread was crispy but not over done.  We had a bit of mishap with when it came to the check, as someone had made a mistake, however another member quickly resolved the issue without question.  That is why I return again and again to this place, also the vocal entertainment that was there also provided a great Sunday lunch experience.",

There were 4 or 6 of us, it was relaxing and we were able to eat some yummy bruchetta and chat and drink some wine in a cute little stylish place.  Then I thought it would be fun to have my little birthday soire there. So I scheduled a party of 15-20 for a Thursday around 8pm. They reserved me the little area just to the right of the entrance. It happened to be really, really busy that night, but, they managed to keep drinks in everyones hands. So although a little chaotic, it was a fun night.  Warning: good luck parking.",

Parking is still rough, but if you know what you're getting into then you park a little bit down the street and hoof it up to the corner.  Bruschetta is still amazing. If you have a group of 3+ get two orders and a big mix of them so everyone can try something new.   I come for wine lunches because the 5 dollar glasses are great. The beer list was also surprisingly good the last time I visited (Late Nov 2008). Including some great imports and domestic craft beers.  I usually stick with a salad or a sandwich for lunch and I've never been disappointed. Nothing specific to suggest, go with something that you generally like and I'm sure you won't be either.  Wait staff has always been pleasant and available when we needed them to be. I always make an effort to ask how their day is going, be friendly and engaging on the initial introduction. This usually helps ensure that they look forward to serving our group, rather than cringe at coming back.  You cannot go wrong with a lunch date here and I'd venture to say that dinner is just as good. Don't miss this gem tucked away in the east/central Phoenix area.",

I am more of a drink and mingle kind of girl, but there is no mingling to be had at Postino.  On the other hand, I can also be an intimate conversation kind of girl, but I didn't feel that was to be had at Postino either.  The room was loud and bright - hence the lack of intimacy.  Maybe it's because I went around happy hour?  Maybe better at night?  As stated in previous reviews, the bruschetta is truly awesome!  I love the fact that they let you choose up to 4 toppings - very original idea.  The service was fabulous, we had more than 4 people attend to our table throughout the evening and our waitress was very helpful with wine & food recommendations.   I will be back - that's for sure. And definitely for the $5 wines when I get the chance from 11-4.  But maybe I'll have lower expectations which will likely result in a better experience.",

This restaurant serves up some of the tastiest bruschetta in town, which appeals to the masses. Seriously, it's hard for me to eat bruschetta anywhere else because of how amazing it is at Postino.  They've also got some other good items on the menu like paninis, salads, and a variety of appetizers - I'd recommend the cheese board and/or the olives to start.  Mondays & Tuesdays you'll need to get here early because they dish out the deal of $20 for a bottle of wine and a bruschetta board. The wait will easily be an hour if you get here late in the evening, not to mention the parking situation here is less than ideal.  A great place for some casual conversation, a bottle of wine, and delicious food...but it's good to catch them at lunch or off peak hours when the whole neighborhood isn't in line to grab a table.",

Not too many drawbacks I can think of other than parking being limited, and since it is a fairly small location, it can get crowded quick. Oh, and I must confess I did find it just a smidgen on the hipster side, but not enough to keep me away thats for sure.",

The happy hour is super and seven days aweek. $5 wine and thats any wine they serve not just the house wine. The food is amazing too. The brushetta plate and the butchers block are a great addition to the wine. Enjoy!!",

Since I don't live in AZ, I orginally heard of this place by Meghan McCain who I follow on twitter and listed this on her blog as one of her favorite Phoenix hang outs for those that are not native to the area.  Although she listed Postino Wine Cafe, I was brought to this location and I was pleasantly surprised when I arrived.  The staff was knowledgeable on their wine selection and provided great service.  The cork on my bottle of Pinot Noir had \"Wine Crystals\" or Wine Diamonds\", nothing I had seen before.  The server was very informative on explaining what it was, turns out I did my own research and the information provided was very accurate.  <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwinesworld.com%2Findex.php%2Fwine-crystals%2F68%2F&s=ca902ab167329f76714073c2ba790f928621bb934f046b0977783b3b19198474\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">winesworld.com/index.php...</a>    Also, If you are a fan of music, on the Friday night that I was there, they played music by The Whitest Boy Alive, The XX, Phoenix, Hercules & Love Affair and Band of Horses to name a few.  I was tapping my toe as some of these are on my own personal playlist so it instantly gained a few stars for the music alone.   Next, I'm coming back for Sangria Sundays and reggae.  Overall a very unique experience, great ambiance and delicious food.   Cheers!",

For our appetizer we got the bruschetta. Salami&pesto was not my favorite from the ones I tryed befor. Spicy tomato jam on goat cheese, omg this one is to die for bye far my favorite. Prosciutto with figs & mascarpone this one was also very tasty The sweetness of the fight just topped it off. Fresh Mozzarella with tomato basil witch is a classic yumii. For my on tray I got the half soup and saled. The saled was amazing head had a really nice presentation. It was the raspberry chicken saled it had organic chicken saled with pecans apples gorgonzola and mayo with fresh mixed greens with raspberry vinaigrette.the food quality for the price is awsome. Very reasonable for this area. Their services though was not up to par. Our server was kinda rude and it took forever to get out food. At lest 45min witch seams a bit long. Was very disappointed in that. Last time I came here every one was so nice and friendly. Mabye it was just an off day.",

The couch area is great to reserve for bigger groups. I usually opt to sit at the bar, especially when Zander is there. He's friendly, great service, and always love catching up with him.   Also, definitely don't pass up their bruschetta boards. You pick any 4 flavors and they're all so delicious it's tough to choose just 4. One of my savory favs is their salami & pesto. Some sweet favorites are their apple, brie, and fig, as well as their ricotta and dates with pistachios. But honestly they're all so scrumptious!",

Postino Arcadia was originally recommended to us when we visited Phoenix in Jan 2018 when we were visiting for our 40th anniversary by hotel staff.   We deviated from highway just to come here for an early Happy Hour/Dinner en route to NM for the night.    We arrived before 5 p.m. which was great since I love wine.  All wines are $5 per glass prior to 5 p.m. I opted for a Chilean Cabernet Sauvignon, De Martini, normally $12 per glass.  I scored 2 glasses for $10.  YAY!   Meanwhile, my husband, as designated driver, got to enjoy Diet Coke and water.   We ordered Bruschetta (choose 4) for $15.  They had a dozen to choose from but we ended up selecting (1) Brie, Apple & Fig Spread, (2) Fresh Mozzarella, Tomato & Basil, (4) Prosciutto di Parma, Fig & Mascarpone and (4) Smoked Salmon & Pesto.   OMG, they were ALL delicious!!!  All the ingredients were super fresh making the bruschetta that much more enjoyable!!  I wish we lived closer. Too bad we live in San Antonio, Texas.  Just too far to drive for Happy Hours.  But, we will be back in October and November so we will make every excuse to come back.",

All I have to say is, the bruschetta boards at Postino's are truly amazing, choose four from twelve selections for only $15. This was the best brusvhetta I ever had. I cant wait to visit again and try other menu options..  Go to Postino for the food, for the wine, for the relaxed, open atmosphere, for the service, you will not be disappointed.",

All the locations are always busy (so there's almost always a wait) but the atmosphere is still relaxed and perfect for a big group of friends or for a romantic night out.  My friends are especially crazy about the Monday & Tuesday bottle and board special, where after 8pm you get to choose any 4 bruschetta options and any bottle of wine for $20! It's such a great deal since their bruschetta board is normally $15.  My favorite thing to order here is the veggie sandwich, which doesn't sound impressive but it's AMAZING. It's packed with fresh veggies and goat cheese, and you get their delicious side salad with nuts, feta, and balsamic dressing and it's all only $11! I LOVE Postino.",

    "text": "Oh Postino, how I miss thee. I moved to Washington but every time I go back to Arizona, I always make time to stop at Postino! This place just makes my heart happy. The atmosphere makes me feel like one of the cool kids & even though the wait times during prime times can be bad, it's worth the wait. Trust me.  Some of my favorite bruschetta's are: smoked salmon w/ pesto and capers, prosciutto with figs and mascarpone, ricotta with dates and pistachio and the salami and pesto. If you're feeling frisky, try the nine iron panini and raspberry chicken salad.   Service has always been great & although I've tried 3 of the 4 Postino's in the valley, I'd say even though Arcadia is smaller in size, it's the best one.  I have dreams and that dream would be for a Postino to open up in Seattle ;)",

I've been to Postino multiple times at the Arcadia and the Central locations, and I love the vibe, the amazing Bruschetta boards, and the good variety of wines. The food quality and taste are consistent across locations, and different locations have unique decors, which add more flavor to the whole dining experience.  My favorite Bruschetta options are: Warm Artichoke Spread, Prosciutto with figs & mascarpone, Burrata bacon arugula & tomato, and Almond hummus with chopped tomato. Will need to come with more people so that I can order 2 boards with 8 options next time!   Don't forget they have the $20 bottle + board happy hour on Mon and Tue after 8pm! Is today Monday yet?",

The place is also dog friendly if you want to bring your pet with a very nice relaxed patio.    Several of the staff came to check on how we were doing...This is truly a gem in Arcadia...",

Even though it's hard to top the bounty board I previously mentioned, but I have to admit they have by far the moscato I have ever tasted and believe me I have tried a ton. Make sure you make your visit during happy hour the wine is half off!",

Unfortunately, this deal doesn't start til 8PM (which seemed later than I remembered) but the boards were just as delicious. Honestly, though their offerings of bruschettas are varied, from brie and apple, sweet and spicy pepper jam to smoked salmon the bruschettas tend to be on the sweeter side of things. But paired with their pub board which bring you pretzels, cheese, and chorizo, you have a winning combo. We opted for a moscato, riesling, and a red wine combo of sort, cause how could you not get wine when you're at Postino's and we were not disappointed. And though I wish I caught the board and wine deal, Postino's is always a treat.",

Anytime someone asks me what my favorite place to eat in Arizona is, Postino is my answer. All my out of town guests have been wined and dined with a board and bottle.   It's such a simple concept but Postino does it so well. I can't pinpoint exactly what makes their bruschetta so delectable but it's legitimately mouthwatering. I frequent this location and the newly opened Highland location and always have a fabulous experience each time.   Top bruschetta picks are the mozzarella & tomato, warm artichoke, prosciutto fig, and red pepper and goat cheese. However you can't go wrong with any choice. And $20 boardand bottle on Monday's and Tuesday's? You just can't beat it!",

That was kinda frustrating, but it's obviously a popular place!    The bruschetta was huge and amazing, as was the cheese plate. There was a great selection of wine (and beer I think)  however they don't have a full bar.  (no liquor).  Parking was all valet out front because every single space in their tiny parking lot was filled.  The neighborhood around is all resident only parking, but I managed to find a spot at the end of 39th street where the end few spaces were not just for residents.      I deff want to try this place again, just hopefully on a not so crowded evening to really get a feel for it.",

I will come here anytime and be toally content.   Consistantly high quality, great service and even better atmosphere.  I am obviously not alone in this thinking because Postino can have a hefty wait time, especially for the bruchetta and wine special on Monday nights.  Its WORTH THE WAIT though.  The goat cheese and tomato jam bruchetta is the BEST!  I always try to get a double order of that one instead of picking four different kinds.  I do believe 'sharing is caring' but I have my limits and not when it comes to Postino brushettas.    The wine list is extensive and there are always helpful recommendations for any palatte or budget for that matter.  I have sat at the bar and sampled various wines before choosing and the bartenders have all been very knowledgeable and friendly.    Postino is a perfect place for a date, girls night out, or family dinner.  It is hard to find a singular place that is so appropriate for any occasion.   Parking really isn't a terrible problem. There is a 'free' valet to help you out, which I truly appreciate instead of having to fend for myself in that crowded cramped lot.",

I came to the area for Le Grande Orange Grocery but Postino was right there.  My friend and I had a late lunch here and got to take advantage of the $5 per glass wine deal from 11am-3pm daily.  I love that the wine is served in mini-carafes.    I had the Pick Two deal for $9.50 and had half an Autostrada Panini and a bowl of chicken noodle soup.  The Autostrada was simply marvelous - proscuitto, sopressata, cappicola, mortadella and provolone with a balsamic vinegrette and olive oil.  The bread was incredibly good.    The restaurant is housed in an old post office so it has an industrial feel to it.  The decor is hip and the waitstaff is very friendly.  The atmosphere is very chill and there is a diverse crowd.",

I called them on the 29th & asked if I could make a reservation. They said they don't take reservations & since it was a party of 3 it would be ok & won't be too full either as it's  a Tuesday . We went to Postinos on College Avenue Tempe. They said our wait was 1 hour. We got there at 8.30. Then I called Postinos in Arcadia & told them we were at College Avenue & the wait was 1 hour & it was my Birthday & we didn't want to wait here outside in the heat & I asked if they were full as well & if there was a wait there as well. The guy who answered said there was no wait & they were not full & that the restaurant at College Avenue is always full. I told him we were heading  there & if we could put our name on the list. He said they don't take names over the phone. We took 17 mins to get there & with parking I would say 20 minutes.  When we went in the lady there tells us the wait will be 40 minutes. I had my old Mother also with us. She is 82 years. There was no place to even sit & wait. My Husband went in again to ask if we could sit somewhere & they tell us we can sit at the bar. The bar stools are so high & my Mother couldn't sit there, but we thought we will try as anything was better than standing in that warm air outside. When my husband came out & went back in with us, the lady says Oh! Someone just sat there so there's no space. She then says she will ask the Manager to talk to us. Then we asked if we could sit at the table outside, at least while we wait. We waited there for 25 minutes & couldn't take the heat anymore. Someone was nice enough to give us 3 glasses of water. The Manager never came out to talk to us. I was so disappointed & fed up. Tears just rolled down my cheeks as it was my Birthday & this is what I got.  I couldn't take it anymore, I told my Husband let's just leave. I just wanted to go home. I went in & cancelled my wait & I told the lady please thank whoever answered the phone & said there was no wait. Thanks to him my Birthday Celebration was a total disaster. I asked her what happened to the Manager who was supposed to talk to us. Then she says she thought I said I didn't want to talk to the Manager. Everything was an excuse made for their benefit. She says she didn't answer the phone & there was nothing she could do about whoever told me anything. I told her it was not her fault & that I was only telling her what happened, as she was the only one there. I even showed her my call log to prove I had called them. I then requested to speak to the Manager & explained to him what happened. He really didn't seem to care. He said from the time I got from College Avenue  to Campbell Avenue, they could get busy & there could be a wait. He said maybe when I called there was no wait but it got full in 20 mins.  It seemed unbelievable to me that in 20 minutes a whole restaurant just filled up so much inside & out & also caused a wait of 45 minutes. Just cannot happen. He was not apologetic or didn't even try to check if he could get us a table or offer any options at all. He was very off handed & just couldn't be bothered. He didn't even check how long more we had to wait or ask us if we would want to wait a few more minutes. Nothing at all. He just seemed happy that it was 1 group less & he could wash his hands off. He Just said it is what it is. I walked out then & heard the Manager & the lady who seats Customers having a good laugh. It might be a laughing matter to them, but I want them to know that they ruined my Birthday. I planned so much & wanted to go there as that's always my special occasion restaurant. We went there for our wedding Anniversary for brunch & last year my Husband had a surprise party for my Birthday also at Postinos. I wanted it to be my Celebration there this year too. Instead I am now going to bed hungry as I just lost my appetite & I am so very sad. I came home & cried so much. It was past 9.30 & too late to get dinner from any place & I was not in the mood to sit & order. We went to a drive through & got some food for my Husband & My Mother. So thanks to The lovely people at Postinos my Day, I planned so much for was ruined. I will never go back, as it will be bad memories.",

Usually we have made this a dinner spot, but a few weeks ago I went for Saturday lunch with my mom and her friend.  It was the perfect spot - they had the back walls opened up to outside and the atmosphere was fabulous for a social midday meal.  Other favorites on the menu are: prosciutto and brie panini and the mediterranean salad, add turkey.  Additionally, the wine selection is wonderful!",

Tried this place twice now and you get the feeling that they really don't like you or don't want you there. Egos are massive, service was shat. If you like GOOD or even half way decent service, stay away from this place.",

Postino has an extensive wine list and also offers an awesome variety of beers. Their beer list includes your basic domestics, higher end domestics, and a handful of tasty imports.  The food is amazing as well, with the highlight being the bruschetta. When ordering the bruschetta, you choose any four of eleven yummy choices. None of the eleven are bad, however my favorites are the brie and apples with fig spread, Mozzarella with tomato and basil, salami with pesto, and the warm artichoke spread.  The outdoor seating area is the place to be and the prices are very reasonable.  Great food, awesome wine list, good beer selection, nice ambience, and reasonable prices give Postino five stars.",

The only downside of loving something so much is that I hardly venture out and trying something else on the menu. I think my favorite is the red peppers - I don't know how they get so much good flavor in a tiny little piece.   The only other thing I have had their is what I call the \"magic sandwhich.\" Also known as the chicken and mozzarella panin but I sub the mayo for a pesto sauce. Yum Yum Yum!  Plus they have an amazing selection of drinks and a great happy hour (if only it went a little longer in the afternoon it would be perfection).",

No but seriously - it's amazing, and it will ruin you for any other restaurant's interpretation of bruschetta. Period. I did have to ding one star simply for the fact that this place is impossible to get into during any time of any day, and they will not take reservations for groups under 8-10 people. The service here is great, beer/wine selection is wonderful, and it's a great atmosphere. LOVE that they offer valet, or else parking would be an absolute nightmare.",

We had been to Postinos before, but never to this location. We sat outside and the lighting of the place was perfect for a romantic night. The service was incredible. I believe our server was Mark. We were in between two types of bruschetta for our last pick and he ended up bringing the other one we didn't order just so we could try it - on the house. It only would have been an extra $4 for us to try, but it was the gesture that really impressed us.   We will definitely be back again for the food, but we loved the service at this location!!",

When asked for more they brought us a bowl of the hard stuff, it was quite frustrating since the service overall was bad for us. We had a server who left right after taking our initial drink order and no new server took us on.

    "text": "By now, I'm guessing that everyone has been to Postino Winecafe. If for some cosmic reason you haven't made it, you really should.  Sometimes you just aren't ready to go straight home from work. That's when it's time to tap your local neighborhood eatery, pull up a chair and unwind.  Postino Winecafe is one of those hangouts. Its first location opened in 2001 by the same folks subsequently responsible for La Grande Orange and LGO Pizzeria. Even if either location isn't in your 'hood, you'll quickly feel welcomed by an attractive and friendly staff.  At the Arcadia location I visited, parking is at a premium, so it's a good idea to come early or late. Checking the car into the valet (only $3) will save potential aggravation. Parking is complimentary at the Central location.  As I sat taking in the crowd and the space, I couldn't help but ponder: Should I order beer or wine? With a worldwide and world class selection, there is plenty to choose from.  I was feeling like a Belgium beer, so I went for the Chimay Grand Reserve ($8). At quadruple the flavor and double the alcohol content compared to domestics, this beer has a certain yeasty earthiness that's surprisingly not heavy or thick.  A small bowl of olives came to the table so I could start chowing down with my drink selection. They're smart by teasing with a small bowl because after one olive you'll want to order a full bowl ($5) with a blend of Luques, Picholines, Gaetas, Red Cerignolas, Arbequinas and Castelvetranos.  Snacking and sharing is key to the menu, but if you want to compose dinner out of salads and sandwiches, that's just as easy.  The Pub Board ($10) severs up a soft, hot and steamy pretzels made from local bakery MJ Bread. Alongside are a selection of Schreiner's chorizo, cornichon pickles, aged cheddar and giant Spanish corn nuts for a major snack attack.  Panini, a grilled Italian sandwich, has many varieties. On this visit the Nine Iron ($9.50) was just all right. Filled with hickory-smoked bacon and layered with grilled chicken and fresh burrata mozzarella, it sounds like a hole-in-one, but the soggy lettuce left me in the sand trap.  The salad that came along was dressed well but it was composed of too many pieces of white and bitter romain cores. After mentioning this to the server it this was quickly addressed with apologies. It's OK to share your expectations with any establishment, whether good or bad.  Bruschetta ($12.75), four to an order grilled bread covered with a choice of preparations, scored major kudos. It was love at first bite! My choices were Prosciutto with Figs and Mascarpone, Tomato Jam and Fresh Sheep's Milk Cheese, Albacore Tuna with Gaeta Olives and Salami with Pesto. Salty, creamy, sweet and chewy -- this was a full-on taste party!  The Salted Caramel Sundae ($5) was the grand finale. Vanilla ice cream with chocolate-covered corn nuts and a pretzel stick with a salted caramel shot was all I ever wanted.  This is food that I love to eat -- clean, simple and fresh. When paired with my favorite beer or wine, I could easily stop by on my way home from work every night.",

My friend and I shared the brushetta sampler [Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil, Tuscan Tuna with Gaeta Olives, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, and Salami with Pesto].  The bruschetta was delicious.  It was baked to perfection!  For two light-eaters like my friend and me, that filled us up quick!  But what's a cozy dinner without dessert?

Because it's such a great deal, there was always a long wait.  But no worry, because wandering through the store at LGO is a perfect way to kill some time.  The bruschetta and bottle is usually enough for two, but we like to add in the Butcher's Block which is a selection of meats, cheeses, olives, and asparagus.    I love Postino for providing a great place to be with friends, wine, and great food, at an excellent price on a Monday or Tuesday night.  I think it starts the week off right.",

That is what I half expected about Postinos.  Instead, this place EXCEEDED the already high expectations others had set in place for it.   I came here on a Friday evening a couple of weeks ago after a wine tasting at LGO. It was 6:30-7:00pm and we only waited a couple of minutes for a table.   It was just me and a girlfriend and since we have the same taste in wine, we decided to order a bottle to share.  We had the RIckshaw Pinot Noir which was delightful.  For food we had the Cheeseboard and the mozzarella and tomato jr.  AMAZING.  I love cheese (as do most wine lovers) and their cheeseboard was delicious.  It features a great variety of cheeses from mild to strong in flavor.    In my eyes the best combo of foods and flavors is the ever simplistic tomatoes, mozzarella, and basil.  Postinos does it perfecto. Everything is fresh as fresh as can be, my mouth is watering just thinking about it!  I had major food envy when I saw the table next to us get served an impressive plate of Bruschetta.  I will definitely be trying that the next time I come.   Here is how much I loved this place: I just found out my schedule is changing and I'll be getting off work at 3 instead of 5.  Literally the first thought that popped in my head was \"I can make it to Postino's for their amazing happy hour!\"   I literally can not wait to go back to this place.",

I was actually reluctant bringing my 2 and 4 year old to a hipster wine bar but when we arrived, we were greeted warmly and they were very nice and welcoming to my kids. So I was immediately put at ease.  They have an awesome kids menu with food kids will eat but upscale - PB and J bruschetta or grilled cheese, both accompanied with grapes, apple slices and chips AND a cute little bendy toy - nailed it! There was a 3rd option but it escapes me at the moment.   I ordered the same thing I had on sunday - white wine blend and bruschetta, soooo good! I crave it.  I have to say, the customer service is superb. I actually was able to have a relaxing lunch with a wiggly 2 and 4 year old. Fantastic!",

We sat at the bar with a stranger and had a memorably delightful time. The food isn't the most filling, but it is DELICIOUS. Everytime I think of Postinos Arcade, I'll always remember the fun conversation we had with that stranger, and the good food.  PROTIP: We went there on a Saturday and if you want to park you need to valet, which is a whole $3. Do you know what I could do with $3? I could buy bubblegum, get 64% off a DVD at the Walmart $5 bin, and I can even buy a used book! Outrageous!  The only problems was there is no post office to drop off your mail, nor is there an arcade. I think that's False advertising.  Aree Va Dare Chee!",

Have to say I think I like the Gilbert locale better and I'm almost a little sick hearing myself say that. Not sure what was up with the rap music on this visit as I am in love with the music at the other locations. Not a great fan of the valet either as they don't seem to know how to dive manual cars or operate emergency  brakes.   So, I'm giving this location 4 stars based on the whole concept and the food (and assuming it will be better next time) but in my heart it gets 3 stars.",

He used to work at the joint and said that it is amazing.   When my friend and I arrived at the door the hostess said that it would be an hour and fifteen minutes for a table, on a TUESDAY! WOW! That says a lot about this place. Instead of waiting we just grabbed a side table in the lounge and had the most Amazeballz Salted Caramel Sundae!  Our server was prompt with waters and our order. I went to the bar to meet Josh, the bartender. I told him that I was friends with Peter and he said that he was expecting me to come in. He said that this was a slow night! HA! Josh seemed like a really nice guy and a fun person to have serve you.   I love the open concept, eclectic mix of music, hip scene and beautiful crowd.    I'm telling you what, if I ever moved to Phoenix I'd love to work at this place! As an experienced industry person, I could tell that this place has it's shit together. :-)",

I really do think you can be full and satisfied by ordering just the bruschetta. Another tip is that you can order half boards. So you can say, \"half salami & pesto, and half brie and apples\" if you want to sample as much as you can in one visit.  Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil - yummy, a classic. Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone - definitely my second favorite!!!!! Salami with Pesto - delicious!!!! Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes - delicious. Ricotta with Dates & Pistachios - MY #1 ABSOLUTE FAVORITE White Bean with Chopped Tomato - yum! Warm Artichoke Spread - unimpressed. didn't live up to my expectations. I ordered this once and didn't bother to order it again on subsequent visits. Brie & Apples with Fig Spread - I'm allergic to apples (weird, I know) so I cannot comment on this one. But my friends loved this.  Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese - never tried this. Smoked Salmon with Pesto - never tried this. Tomato Jam & Fresh Sheeps Milk Cheese - never tried this.",

    "text": "Postino. Oh, how you bring love to my heart with your bruschetta boards and interesting atmosphere.   Love this place! Here's some tips; everyday before 5pm the glasses of wine are $5.. You may have a tough time finding parking so make it easy on yourself and bring cash to valet. Make sure to stop by the LGO grocery store after you eat at Postino.   Now, onto the food at Postino. Pretty much the best thing you can order is the Bruschetta board because its SOOOO AWESOME!   As many other Yelpers with great taste have mentioned, a couple of the best bruchettas (although it's tough not to just order 2 boards and get them all- except the artichoke, that one should be avoided).   Highly Recommended (I don't have the exact names down, but here's the main); the salami one, the one with fig, apples and brie (****BEST*****), the roasted red pepper and mozz/basil/tomato.   The first time you go, you may just have to order 2 boards if your party is big enough, because they are all so good, except for the artichoke one- that one is NOT good.   The wait staff does a great job, and I love everything about Postino! After writing this review I need go, like this weekend... Like now, wait, \"Can we go to Postino for lunch?\"",

I ordered the bruchetta (one each of the apple and brie, prosciutto and fig, burrata and bacon, and warm artichoke). The bruschetta was incredible. I'd go back just to eat it all again. Maybe tomorrow.  Parking was open and available when I got there, but it looked like it was exclusively valet starting at about 5pm.",

I was not wow'd by much even at places that had good reviews, and disappointed I couldn't find a decent meal. And then I came to Postino! It was bustling on a Sunday morning with nearly all the tables in the restaurant filled. Luckily we were able to snag a table out on the patio. The air was filled with live music and the atmosphere was relaxed and exciting at the same time.   Everyone on Yelp mentioned the bruschetta. Definitely get the bruschetta!!! You can choose 4 different types for $13.50. The bread was perfectly soft and all the toppings were excellent. If I had my way, I could eat this all the time. The two of us also shared an Vegetarian panini which was very good but too filling to finish alongside the bruschette. Mimosas are only $5 too.   Postino's is worth it!",

Meaning the table was so low you have a lot of distance to the mouth and more opportunity to spill. Lost a star because I don't like eating in my living room. Why are restaurants now making their dining room a living room? If you want to do the sofa and chair thing do it outside. Not fond of high tops either.

    "text": "Postino will forever be my favorite wine bar outside of California , I am 100% convinced of this fact. Having lived in the PHX area permanently now for a few years, I can honestly say that Postino has set the standard on the bruschetta bar.. and it is high very hard to find one that compares! I have not found any other place that even comes close on the bruschetta variety and taste scale . For $14 you can get four different bruschettas that are generous and on the perfectly, freshly baked bread.. not soggy and not too crisp! I actually don't have a favorite one and I like that Postino has a seasonal bruschetta now that changes from the usual. It's always fun as a group to order all of the bruschettas amongst a few boards and sample them all! The cheese board is always good; the salads you can't go wrong with , either. Monday's and Tuesday's after 8pm, bring your date or your friends and $20 gets you bruschetta and a bottle of vino! Or how about brunch for $5 mimosas or sangria on the weekend ? I've also ordered catering from Postino and they always get it correct! Sometimes I just NEED that amazing bruschetta variety in my home for entertaining ! This is always my favorite place for a date night with my new hubby. I introduced him to wine, ( okay not really!!)  and thus, Postino Arcadia being in my old pre-marital hood, we cultivated some of our 3 years together right here in Arcadia at this very Postino.. and if wine isn't your thing, don't worry, they have a great selection of brews! After wine there are lovely, yummy desserts or for brunch , Postino offers cappuccinos and lattes. The patio is dog friendly and the ambience is all lit dimly with candlelight and hip beats for your sipping. Since this is about my 9000th review for Postino, I think it's safe to say, I rate it on the highest PHENOM level!",

I also ordered the tomato jam and artichoke spread flatbreads to try. The flatbreads are more of a bruschetta (served on toasted baguette) rather than a traditional flatbread. I was actually pleasantly surprised and ate those up like nobody's business. I do wish the tomato jam had a tad of spice to it, because it did get too sweet in a weird way. Regardless, I can't wait to come back and try more flatbreads. Come early because by 11:45am the parking lot was full (though there is mandatory valet).",

Be sure to get the Apple, Brie and Fig if you are getting the bruschetta and save it for last.  Also outstanding was the Smoked Salmon with Pesto. My girlfriend also had a cup of the soup of the moment which was Tomato Basil.  She said it was fantastic. And of course when discussing an evening at Postino you have to talk about the wine.  The selection is amazing and the staff is knowledgeable about the selection without being pretentious like I've seen in similar places.  If you are intimidated by the selection or just don't know what you would like they will be able to assist you with finding the perfect match for your meal and your tastes.",

    "text": "On a Monday/Tuesday night, if you time it right, Postino's is a neighborhood staple in Arcadia. The $20 for a bottle and board of bruschetta is a *steal*. As one of employee said, \"How could you not order this?\" while we waited for our table.    My friend and I arrived early to request a table for four. Perched on a tall side table we enjoyed a full view of the restaurant. Sipping not so daintily we quickly passed the 45 minute wait.    Once seated Bethany was a wonder. Our bill was seamlessly transferred and waters arrived. The neat thing about traveling in a pack of four is that, Yes, You Can drink three bottles of wine. What could possibly be better than that? It removes the need to think hard about the bruschetta menu. (There are 12 options so we had one of each brought out.)  We surprised the fella in the group. He doubted that three bruschetta boards would be sufficient to feed his hungry belly. If you haven't been before, a bruschetta is palm sized and sliced into four pieces. Trust me, there's plenty.   But if you're still hungry this is a wine bar and they have food. The panini selection is wonderful, I beg to argue the Nine Iron is the best.  (Bacon layered with grilled chicken, burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and dijonnaise!) Another approach, perhaps on another visit, is to order the Butchers Block (big assortment of meat and cheese) for $14 and/or the Cheese Board for $13.  If for some reason wine is not up your alley, Postino's offers pitchers of beer. If you need to drink a cocktail...suck it up kid. That's not happening here. The Mon/Tue special begins at 8pm. I'd recommend scoring a table before the start time, even if that means buying some appetizers beforehand.   Make sure to ask for Bethany! She's the sweetest thing!",

    "text": "I truly love Postino Arcadia! I visit this spot often to enjoy their gorgeous patio. The food is consistently good and you can choose from a delicious variety. My favorite bruschetta pieces are the prosciutto, fig and jam, the ricotta with dates and pistachio and the goat cheese and peppers. Delicious! If the mood is striking in the direction of a salad, go for the chicken walnut salad. It doesn't disappoint! Happy hour is daily from 11-5pm with $5 glasses of wine. Tuesday nights you can get a board of bruschetta and a bottle of wine for $20. This is a great deal! Cheers!",

Amazing...although, the next time, I'd switch the artichoke for the apple with fig jam one! We also got the green mix salad which I thought may be just a tegular greens salad with pear but no. The fried leeks on top and dressing...yum!!  All so good.",

The service was not good. Our waitress was aloof and barely waited for us to speak before she was walking away. Our appetizers came out with the main dish and took longer than what seemed necessary given the number of customers and what we ordered. Ambience is good...light and airy.

You can't go wrong with any of the Bruschetta choices such as warm artichoke spread, Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, Smoked Salmon with Pesto, Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato. Come early to beat the rush hour of happy hour or you will be forced to wait a while. Come here on Monday and Tuesdays to enjoy the $20 bruchetta board and a bottle of wine!

And since I can't get here on the light rail I have to drive. And if I have to drive, I have to park. But when I can't park, it's a hassle.   However, once you achieve parking success, Postinos is awesome. I love that it's in an old post office. I love how the garage doors open, like a giant Arizona room. I like the drinks, I like the laid back lounge atmosphere, I like the service. It's a little pricey, but hey, this isn't McDonalds. I remember that I really liked their bruschetta. I've gone to Postinos to welcome friends back to Phoenix and sometimes to say goodbye. It's a great place for both.",

Now granted, I am personal friends with Brent (and Matt) so I want to disclose this upfront, but I am elated with the new direction of the wine program as I think it is superior to most in its consumer friendly format. Grab a plate of bruschetta and $5 glass of ABC (anything but Cabernet) at the bar. Ask Brent or the chilled staff to help you pick something great.  Like the mythical Arcas, you can bear the budget bacchanalian orgy right in the heart of Arcadia",

I love this place, and if you're looking to go out with a small group of friends, and need a place where you can have fun, but eat too, then this is the place for you.  Beware though, if you go during regular dinner rush, expect to wait at least 30-40 minutes before being seated.  I have eaten at Postino's on several occasions, and have never received bad service, that's of course after you have waited for 45 minutes.  If you want to try a place very similar without having to wait so long to be seated, but you can sacrifice a little bit of the quality than I would recommend The Living Room in South Chandler.  Otherwise, enjoy the food at Postinos and have a great time.",

Postino knew we were coming and set aside a great little arrangement of couches, tables and chairs for us all.  I had two glasses of wine, Grayson Cabernet (which was really good) and a Reisling (I can't remember which one, but I liked it).  My friend and I also split the selection of four bruschettas.  We had the brie and apple (my favorite), the caprese, goat cheese and roasted red peppers and salami and pesto.  They were all amazingly good!    Simply put though, I love this place because it is consistently good. The service is always great, it is reasonably priced, the food and wine are delicious and the ambiance is wonderful.  Right now is the perfect time of year for them to roll up their garage doors and let the fresh air in off their patio.  And the dimly lit bar is the perfect place to get a little tipsy on a Tuesday.  ;)  I will continue to go back time after time because I am never let down.  PS:  After reading their menu front to back, even though I have it memorized, I noticed that on Mondays and Tuesdays for $20, you can get a bottle of house wine and a plate of bruschetta.  This is definitely enough for two people to make a meal out of or for three to four to share as an appetizer.  What a great deal!  My only complaint remains their monopoly on parking and the pretty much mandatory valet.  Just let me park my own God damn car!  If you don't mind walking a bit, though, you can skip this part.",

With at least 8 selections to choose from both my husband and I found bruschetta that we enjoyed.   For dinner I had the mixed green salad and he chose the tuna panini. My salad was much better than it's very ordinary title. With grapes, Gorgonzola, tiny fried onion strings and a wonderful vinaigrette I left feeling satisfied but not overfilled. My husband's tuna panini was also excellent with a perfect amount of flavor.  The best part about the restaurant for me, was the ambiance.  We went late in the evening.  The soft flickering candle light and open dining room created an atmosphere that would be wonderful to dine with either friends, or a date. It would be a perfect place to spend a few leisurely hours sipping wine and talking.  We are excited to go Sunday from 12-3 for $5 Sangria and live reggae!",

The sun was shining, music was playin, and Postino's was happenin.   We started things off with some Mimosas (it was still only 11:30) along with the bruschetta. This bruschetta plate was the best thing ever. You had four large pieces of bruschetta, topped with whatever you wanted, and then sliced into four. So we had 16 delicious pieces of warm bread with amazing stuff on top to go with our first round of Mimosa's.   Noon time came, and it was time to switch to beer. What's this you say? 5 dollar pitchers of beer???? ALL DAY?!?!?! Sign me up! And this ain't no Bud Light sports bar pitcher, this is Hoegarden baby, and Odell's IPA. This is good freakin beer! So the wife got a cup of the soup, and we drank beer, and life was pretty freakin great.   The sun was shining down on us pretty hard at this point, so we moved onto the couch area to beat the heat. There we sat for another couple of hours, putting away pitcher after delicious pitcher of beer, when the hunger bug snuck up on us again. No matter, PUB BOARD to the rescue! Pretzels and mustard and nuts and cheese and chorizo, and MORE BEER!   All this food, mimosas, pitchers of beer, more food, and more pitchers of beer, and our entire afternoon cost me $55. That's not bad.   Oh my oh my. This place is really fun, really cool, and the 3 super cute waitresses don't hurt anything either. Best valentines day ever, and thank you Postino's for facilitating our drunken afternoon! I will be back soon, and back often!",

The bruschetta was phenomenal and I could say the same about our sandwiches. The staff was friendly, helpful, and came by just often enough to make sure our glasses were never empty. We were here in the early afternoon and, with the garage doors open, there was a great breeze throughout the restaurant. I didn't notice one open table yet it didn't feel crowded nor did we have to yell over one another to have a conversation.   Next time I am in Phoenix I will definitely be coming back here. Each and every time.",

    "text": "I won't even venture to guess why so many people like this place. But a few notes: no, it is nothing like a European cafe; no, it is not an actual wine bar; yes the service absolutely sucks.  We came here for a friend's birthday party. Her mother had arranged ahead of time for 10 of us to be there and to have wine brought to the tables and poured and some appetizers brought out while we were waiting for the guest of honor. But before that, let's start with parking.   You can't park in the residential streets because you need a permit. Fine. I heard they had a valet and there's nothing on their website about parking so, whatever. I head to the valet who asks me if I am dining at Postino's or La Grande Orange. I say Postino's and he says \"Ok, that's $3.\" I asked if they seriously were charging me for valet parking based on which restaurant I was going to and they wouldn't answer. I asked if there was an ATM since I had no cash and they told me there is one but it doesn't work. I got back in my car and drove around looking for a place to park for about 15 minutes. Fantastic.  When I get there, about 6 girls from the party are standing at the front waiting for someone to notice them. Finally, a very unfriendly gentleman pointed to two tables and said \"Those are yours. Those other tables where people are eating are also yours but they're not done yet. We told them when they were seated they needed to be done in an hour but they're still there.\" Ok, so now we only have two of our four tables. Great. Finally they seat us at our two tables. Another unfriendly staff member comes over and plunks down a few wine glasses and asks if we want a glass of temperanillo. She pours one of the girls a random taste and then walks away. Upon her return I asked if this was the wine we were supposed to have because it was a Malbec. She argued with me about that for a few minutes until I pointed to the label. She said \"Oh\" and walked away. I never did find out if we were supposed to have the Malbec.  At this point, the other two tables had been cleared. No one brought any other glasses or put the tables together, so we did it. Also, no one opened the other bottles, and yes they were screwtop, but still. So I opened them. Finally, everyone else arrived. We still only had 4 wine glasses. After trying in vain for several minutes we finally managed to flag down the unfriendly woman and asked for more wine glasses to which she responded, rudely \"We don't have any more.\" and walked away. I had to ask three different rude, uninterested staff members for wine glasses and managed to finally get another few but still, not everyone ended up with a glass.   Seriously? Anyway, the bruschetta came out. While the menu offers a lof of different ones, they are all so deplorably bland and under-seasoned that they felt unfinished. The fig, marscapone and prosciutto should have been good but the poor pig that gave its life was disgraced. Dry, flavorless. Most of the bread pieces weren't even cut all the way through so we were all man-handling the pieces to get them apart. The bread was obviously just grocery store bread and I doubt anything is truly hand-made. The issue is, the quality of their ingredients sucks. They obviously buy the cheapest grocery store crap they can and then mark it up. Everything, even the apples on one of the bruschettas were lacking in any real flavor when they should have been tart and crisp instead of dull and mealy.   And as for a wine bar? Seriously. A joke. They have a half of a sheet of paper, one side, as their wine list. No flights, no tastings. But for the audience it attracts who are easily impressed by over-priced glop and wine in a trendy area, they'll continue to do just fine. I will never be back.",

I've had bruschetta at other restaurants but none compared to the ones from Postino.  I think when they spread that topping on those yummy bread, they are thinking good cheer and loving thoughts- how else can you explain the addictive qualities of toppings placed on top of pieces of bread? Love this place and I' would go back again and again.",

Everything I have eaten there has been top notch, and I would specifically recommend the cheese plate, as well as the prosciutto with brie panini.  The one downside is the completely unnecessary valet parking.  While not that much money ($3), it feels like the restaurant is trying to squeeze a few more bucks out of you and is not a nice way to end the evening.",

What a relief to see a trendy, cozy, but still airy sort of place. Exactly what I wanted in a nice wine bar. My friend and I felt fine in nice jeans and cute tops.  This particular day they had a great special. We got a bottle of La Posta wine (I think that was the name) and 4 pieces of bruschetta for $20. The wine was recommended by the waiter...he knew what he was talking about. We got the bruschetta with apples, figs and brie; salmon and capers; prosciutto with figs & marscapone and the last had salami on it. The apple bruschetta was my favorite.  I'll be back and will take more friends to experience the food, wine and atmosphere.",

I can't say enough good things about it so I will try to be as concise as possible.  My friends and I usually go on Friday and Saturday nights and it is understandably busy.  We all usually grab a delicious glass of wine and don't mind the short wait at all.  I cannot say enough nice things about the staff here.  They are always very polite, friendly, and conscious of getting us seated as soon as possible.  We always order one or two planks of bruschetta to start out.  I have had them all and love them equally.  To follow that I usually order the prosciutto and brie panini.  All the ingredients taste so fresh and the bread is equally delicious (I have to admit I am picky about bread, coming from San Francisco sourdough land) I have to admit that all the food and wine fill me up so I have never tried their desserts but I am sure they are amazing as well.  The food is amazing.  The service could not be better.  The ambiance is nice and casual. The price is more than reasonable.  I have no criticisms for this restaurant and encourage everyone to go!",

They have live music on weekends and I've heard its packed on sunday afternoons as well. They offer valet parking and free parking on the streets and nearby parking lot.

Started off with a glass of champagne just because I was on vacation and I could :)   We also had some champagne mixers they were making specially that day that were really nice. I had some trouble deciding what to eat since the menu all looks so tasty but i went with the bruchetta.  I mean, come on, you get to choose 4 toppings, how could I not!  I even had a hard time choosing only 4!  I had the apple with brie and fig spread (my favorite), roasted red pepper with goat cheese (very good), prosciutto with figs and marscapone (wow) and salami with pesto (great).  All of this for $12 and HUGE!  Four heaping pieces of bread cut into four pieces each.  My friend also got the roasted artichoke one which was just as delicious.   Three glasses of champagne and more bruschetta than I could possibly eat I was extremely satisfied.   I've been actually thinking lately...where can I get this delicious food in LA?",

The staff is very knowledgeable about the wines and food ... I never ask a question they can't answer! The atmosphere is chill and classy, without being stuffy. My first time was for a bridal shower ... the staff managed it fantastically, always quick in bringing more food and drink and never, ever seeming overwhelmed. Whether you're a party of 2 or 20 try Postino ... you're gonna like it.",

Not alot of parking, but that is pretty much the only thing I could possibly complain about. Nice intimate atmostphere to just have good solid fun with good people. Customer service was good (server took my beer/glass - without asking me if I wanted another). The bathroom is very clean and can probably be described as very zen-like. Food wise - the bruschetta impressed me alot, actually the whole place did so I will definately be back. Mostly to participate in the 11-4 5$ wine!!",

Didn't feel like I was in Phoenix, which, no matter where you live, on occasion, can feel like a really good thing. More like being in Ess Eff...very urbane. Their crostini were great--brie and apple (not super imaginative, but still good), and ricotta/fig/pistachio--excellent. If you go on a 110+ day, be aware that their a/c system isn't up to handling it. We sweated it out last night until enough people left to help cool the place off. We're new to Phoenix, so we'll be trying the other La Grande Orange eateries on that corner.",

I honestly only took away a star because most of the people you'll be surrounded by are douchebag yuppies and it can get really annoying.  It's not the restaurant's fault, just... be prepared.  Their panini are really good, but it pisses me off when restaurants offer potato chips or some bland salad as their side.   Offer a real side, don't just dump half a bag of Miss Vickie's, or whatever, next to my sandwich and call it a day.  Otherwise, have the decency to go balls-deep, abandon the kettle crisps, be honest, and just load the plate up with Cheetos or Doritos Cool Ranch.

My personal favorite is red bell peppers with goat cheese. I really like that you can pick for different toppings for a single serving - it's a great way to sample all the different types of bruschetta. The bellinis are also really good if you're not in a beer or wine mood.  I really need to go back and try more of the menu. Can't wait!",

    "text": "CIAO! =)    Beautiful bruschettas.  Huge yummy paninis, decadent desserts, and great service....ah.. perfecto! =) Add in a dash of dim lights, open air, and casual jazz music and you have romance in the making!   Postino reminds me of tapas...but Italian styled. They only serve a few items on their menu ... a few appetizers, salads, soups, bruschetta, paninis, and desserts.   BRUSCHETTA is what they're known for... I agree that they are quite expensive $13 for 4 pieces of large varied bruschetta but they use some good stuff!  I ordered : - Brie & Apples with Fig Spread -- FAVORITE! crisp tart apple contrasted with a light sweet spread, soft brie and toasty baguette. drizzled with a bit of sweetness for a perfect touch.   - Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone -- who knew I liked fig so much??? Delicious. Loved the light olive oil drizzle too. I appreciated that the prosciutto wasn't salty.   - Salami with Pesto -- not as unique , but still tasted great  - Fresh Mozzarella with Tomato & Basil -- -mm.. fresh~! My sister ate almost all of these...=9  hubby + sister ordered paninis ... didn't really try those but they tasted fine. didn't really leave a huge impression cuz I was concentrating on my bruschettas. my bro-in-law got a customized salad w. soup. good portions!!! The people on our next table over ordered a cheese board ... looked delicious. I'll have to order that next time I'm around!  Oh ...and wine! $5 for wine before 5pm on Sunday!  There is plenty of parking in their lot! =)",

    "text": "So many people have had amazing experiences here. Whether its the service you get , the food quality, the ambiance or the amazing deals... its all been said. But hell, I will say it all again..  ~Fud/Drink~ I have had bruschetta many times, at many places. They do bruschetta the RIGHT WAY. They give you so many different options to choose from, and each one tastes as good as the next. I am a salmon fan, so their salmon bruschetta was exquisite in my eyes. They have so many amazing wines to offer you as well, so many its almost impossible to not find the right fit for your meal. I have yet to try other main entrees on the menu, but do not worry I will. Just remember, you can taste the quality. They take good care of their product and make sure the kitchen pumps out quality dishes.  ~Atmosphere/Service~ The Servers really know their stuff. They understand why you're their and they seem to really rock to the vibe of the place. Hipsters love it, I love it, and the servers are awesome at what they do. The suggestions they provide prove to really help make the night a better one. The atmosphere is great, a real hipster vibe for sure. I enjoy a relaxed calm spot personally, especially after a long day at work, and  they nail it. Its just quiet enough to sit down and relax with someone special, yet loud enough that no one can hear your conversation.  ~Extras/Rating~  Regarding the $20 Bruschetta/Wine deal: GET-THERE-EARLY. Or else you might find yourself waiting for an hour to get served. I do not fault them for having to put you on a long wait-list, especially because its such an amazing deal and so popular just suck it up and get there earlier or 30 minutes earlier than what you would normally want. Their $20 Bruschetta/Wine pairing is the best happy hour item I have ever seen. No lie. That alone puts them in the upper echelon for date night go-to's and perfect chill happy hour locations in the valley here.    No one can lay claim to such a unique and perfect option, despite the fact that numerous other bars have attempted. They may try, but the quality of food and vast selection of wines, paired with the ambiance they provide, blows all competitors out of the water. The only thing I hate about this place, is that I didn't think of it first.. :) 5 stars because they deserve it, enough said.",

    "text": "Postino's is a great place for a date or evening out with friends.  The Arcadia location is in a cool neighborhood and the building opens up on one side to an outdoor patio... which is awesome on an evening with nice weather.  I have to admit, I haven't tried very much from the menu.  Every time I come, the rest of the table and I order bruschetta to share and some wine.  Although I'm sure the rest of the food is great, I really do recommend bruschetta.  There are 12 different varieties to choose from, with everything from the classic tomato, mozzarella and basil to brie with apple slices to prosciutto.  Every single one is delicious.  They work well for one order for two people, so order accordingly.  For our group of 4, we got 2 orders.  With four varieties each, we got to try 8 of the 12 available.  It was easiest to say that we'd try one of everything, with the exception of the ones that had an ingredient someone at the table would prefer to skip.  We also split a bottle of wine, which complimented the meal very well.  Our server was knowledgeable enough to recommend a bottle based on what we were in the mood for, and he really hit the mark.  We were amused that the woman whose job it was to fill water glasses would come around so often that the glass never got below half empty.  It was almost too much, but hey, we stayed well hydrated.  The atmosphere is very \"cool\" with dim lighting, modern decor, and a definite wine theme throughout.  Service has been excellent each time I've dined here.  Those are perks for sure, but the bruschetta would keep me coming back anyway!  Check out any of the Postino's that may be near you!  If you go in on Monday or Tuesday after 8, their date night special is a bruschetta platter and a bottle of wine for $20.  Can't beat that!  Keep in mind that Postino Arcadia is valet parking only ;)",

I went to Central last week, loved it, and thought I'd be in love with this spot too. Nope.  Definite five stars for the food - the best bruschetta I've ever had and a bottle of wine for $20? You can never beat that.  Three stars for the service. They were slammed, and I understand that. However, the waitress wasn't friendly. My girlfriend was trying to place her order and the waitress blatantly ignored her to talk to a guy at another table. We didn't even have silverware or napkins at our table and she didn't bring any when we asked her.  One star for valet. Central location offers complimentary valet and Arcadia charges three dollars. That's fine, but I didn't have cash on me and asked the guy to return my car so I can park it myself. He STILL charged me and said something along the lines of, \"The owner makes us charge everyone - liability reasons.\" Uh, what? My car wasn't even in your lot for more than 30 seconds! Anyway, tacky.  Central location has my vote and my five stars.",

    "text": "I can't say that I would fight for a parking space at many places, but Postino makes the list. Will I ever steal a parking spot? Not at all, but I will look long and hard for one here. The wait is worth it yelp friends. Postino does a great job luring customers in and keeping them. With their incredible happy hour, I wish I could sneak away to dine on a glass of wine before 4:00 PM on a weekday and for those who can, I salute you.   Every time I wine and dine at Postino, I leave full, happy and satisfied. The original Postino location will also be my favorite based on it's location, ambiance, character, service and quality products. The wine is obviously top knotch here at Postino. Bottles line the walls and the staff knows their selections inside and out. They offer bottle specials all the time and you can enjoy a bottle at a reasonable price practically every day of the week.   Their food competes with the quality of their wine. I long for their bruschetta. You chose four different flavors and for a reasonable price under $15. My favorite bruschettas are the prosciutto and fig, and tomato paste with cheese. The tomato mozzarella is also a classic. But, it really just depends on your taste buds because any bruschetta you choose will be excellent. Many times, I got for the half sandwich/salad combo. I like to order the Market which isn't on the menu. It comes with pesto, tomato and mozzerela. I make sure to add chicken. The Mediterranean is my go-to salad but I vary between all of their salads. You really just can't go wrong with anything on the menu here. And it tastes even better with wine. Doesn't everything?",

Similar establishments, with great ambience, also ask if you would would like another bottle. This Postino's service does not and their bottles aren't cheap.   Granted, plenty of servers milling around.  Bored support clean off tables but forget to wipe off chairs and at least one appears literally stoned.  I guess the real question is why the server recorks the bottle with a temporary cork after the first and only service pour. Doesn't the Red wish to breath?  There were a few service highlights: tastes of the wines freely offered and a quick response for heat for any desert rats (hey! It's 60 degrees, brr.)  Butcher block is always a highlight and I won't give up on this fun place just yet. It simply needs some good floor management.",

The soups are so warm and delicious i love them on cold dzys and its great if you get a half panini and u can dip your sandwich in it and it makes both the panini and souo that much better...they have paninis for everyone!! The desserts are fabulous my favorite is the salted caramel sundae...i like the caramel ontop of their chocolate cake and ice cream its amazing...of course leave it up to me to love two desserts and combine them...or if you want a good drink other then wine try their bellinis and mimosas...they are delicious at anytime of the day hahaha...just dnt drink too many and drive have someobe get you a cab...

Postino makes me feel like I've enjoyed an evening out, like I've gotten full on yummy food made from quality ingredients, and *almost* like I don't miss New York (my home for the past 6 years). The atmosphere is lively and the service has always been friendly and attentive. The pub board and bruschetta (esp prosciutto & fig) are delicious and cut into portions perfect for sharing. Go with friends, enjoy the wine list, don't over-order on the food, and Postino will make you feel good, too.",

    "text": "I spent a great deal of time looking for places myself and my girlfriends would enjoy for our winter escape to Phoenix from Minnesota.     I found out about Postino and had to try it.  SO glad I did!  Enjoyed the eclectic atmosphere and the great adjectives my server used to describe the wine.    I had the pick two  - prociutto/brie panini with a side of roasted pepper/gorganzola soup.   All to die for!   The ladies at the next table ordered the mix of baguette with different toppings.. looked amazing.    I was there for happy hour and sat on the patio.  I love the atmosphere, very comfortable and non-pretentious.   Very good value.  My bill after eating and having two glasses of wine at happy hour was $21.    My girlfriends arrive tomorrow.  Postino is a definite stop.   Love it!",

The bruschetta is the best in town--period, end of discussion.  The salads sometimes aren't my favorite, but there are plenty that are delicious.  I'll admit that the cheese plates also sometimes leave me wanting, but that is a rare occasion.  It has been interesting to see the wine selections evolve over the past several years.  When it first opened, Postino seemed to have nothing above $35/bottle, and that selection was good.  It stepped up its game in the past two or three years and now boasts a more diverse and more expensive selection (e.g., Sea Smoke pinot noir).  I appreciate the addition of even better wine, and am happy to say that the glass list remains reasonably priced.",

    "text": "I have to say, I DO like their food and the service is always pretty good. The atmosphere is great. HOWEVER, making reservations there is a different story.   They only take reservations for 10 or more. I had 7...  My grandparents are in town, and can't really \"wait at the bar\" until a table is ready. They are old and tired. Hence, I tried to make reservations here, called 24 hours in advance... they told mebthey couldnt do it, but  to come in anyway and 'wait at the bar' for a table. I told them I was going to be with some older people, and asked if there was anyway we could just call in 20 minutes beforehand and put our name on the list, so my grandparents wouldnt have to stand at the bar. They said they didnt do that. Seeing as it THE EXACT SAME THING as coming in to put my name on the list and wait twenty minutes there, I dont see the problem. I asked them politely if they could make an exception considering the situation... they said absolutely not. Where I come from, restaurants will try everything they are capable of to accommodate their guests. This IS NOT what Postino's or the LGO owners do at any of their restaurants. After talking to Postino's, I tried Chelsea's and LGO and got the same answer.  I also tried Chelsea's, which takes reservations for less then 10 but got the same story, they were booked and we could wait. Also asked them about calling in when we were on our way b/c I was with two older people who could not stand long... they said no way.  I own two restaurants, I can tell you-- this is not appropriate customer service. Its also not very moralistic. If a frequent customer explains a situation, seeking a little help, and its not ridiculous, the restaurant shoud be happy to do it.   Seems as if the LGO owners have taken a cue from Houston's... which is the type of place that gives Scottsdale a bad reputation. The type of service that scares out-of-towners away from Arizona because we are too \"snooty.\"",

I am partial to salty and sweet flavors mixed so I go with the proscuitto and fig jam one and it always hits the spot. But, with all that said... my favorite thing at Postinos...the one thing I can not leave without eating even if I have just stuffed myself into an uncomfortable food coma... is the salted caramel sundae. OMG... ice cream with think, rich, buttery, and a hint of saltyness caramel...the little bites of chocolate covered pretzels. Holy cow... it might be on the list of possibilitys for my last meal.",

That said, the place is a really interesting, urban space with either a social or a cozy vibe depending on which table you get.  The bruschette is what they are known for and it's pretty good, given that it is not your typical diced up tomatoes with olive oil and balsamic. We had one with ricotta and pistachio and dates (big hit), one with tomato jam and goat cheese (yum), one with spinach and artichoke spread (pass), and one with apple and brie (good combo).  Side note: seems like they use grocery store brand bread (like a vienna loaf) and then just put some toppings on it and make a killing. Nothing uber authentic about what's going on here, just to warn you.  It seems to me the rest of the menu is just okay.",

I don't think you can go wrong with any of the 8-10 choices on the menu.  I was very impressed with the food. I ordered the Nine Iron Panini and really enjoyed my meal. The panini was cooked perfectly. The chicken, bacon, mozzarella and dijonnaise went very well together.   Often at trendier places, I'm not full after my meal. Postino filled me up though.  The service was very good. Our waiter was attentive to our needs and provided the check in a timely manner.  I can see why this place is popular. Very good food, nice atmosphere and a place to enjoy some wine with friends in a casual setting.  . The only downside is the limited parking and valet parking.",

Each bruschetta slice is probably the size of maybe your hand with your fingers outstretched -- if you're a petite girl  :) ...  They then cut each slice into 4's.  Perfect for sharing!  We went on a Monday night after 8PM and ordered 2 bottles of wine, the 2 orders of the bruschetta (which were 8 slices for those that can't count), and a bowl of olives.  The total came out to about $50...that's a little over $13/person w/o tip!!  AWESOME!!    PLUS, they have complementary valet parking.   Everything was just fantastic, I've never had fig before and they made my experience there quite memorable.  I definitely recommend you come in, regardless if it's for their $20 deals on Mon/Tues or not.  They've got GREAT food and I WILL be back.",

We tried to go once during their happy hour one night and it was packed with a super long wait so we ended up not being able to stay. You could tell it was definitely the place to be. The bruschetta board was awesome and their salads are great too. The service was great, and they really want you to have the right wine that suits your tastes. You can even taste a little of the wine before you make a decision to choose one. I've been collecting wine corks for art projects and they gave me a whole wine bag full of them that I could take home with me. That was pretty awesome. I am definitely coming back to this place the next time I'm in Phoenix and definitely recommending it to my friends who visit Phoenix too!",

It didn't take long before we were raving about our choice. Postino's nailed everything. The setting was casual yet sophisticated with outdoor seating heated via lamp. The wine (or mimosa for me) were delicious. The main sell is their bruschetta. For $14, you can choose four different set of toppings out of a list of eight or so. Each one is spectacular from the prosciutto & mascarpone to the salmon and pesto. The butcher block is an equally tantalizing option--quite possibly the best goat cheese around. Finally, if you aren't convinced yet, the happy hour specials are more than a mere $1 wells. Stop by, you won't regret it.",

The waitresses and waiters are always very attentive and make sure that you are comfortable and satisfied. Because of the wait, our waitress brought us four varieties of bruschetta paid for by the restaurant! After we ordered we got our hot and delicious panini that were flavorful and perfectly portioned. The service continued to be great just like it should be with a private-owned business. If it were possible, I'd give 6 stars!!!! SO awesome!:)",

    "text": "Wow.  I am surprised at all the positive 'over the top' reviews of Arcadia. My experience on June 24 was quite different.  We found the service to be unprofessional and borderline rude. This is a place where you are supposed to relax and enjoy your companions and converse and enjoy a drink in peace.  Instead, the servers (and I don't mean just one but I mean all of them) hover over your table giving you the impression that they want you out of there. This is not good service on any calculation. It is not attentive at all but rather annoying.  Amanda, one of the servers, must have been either bored or not focused, because all she did was swish past the tables about every 1-2 minutes. It was so annoying that we started to time it and sure enough she went by again and again and again. It was as if she was on ice skates--or perhaps even more so was trying to get someone's attention.   NOT attentive but rude.  The others were abrupt in their interactions with us and frankly not very helpful. One of them just starting ripping all the glasses off the table when it was obvious we were in deep conversation. Back off! She just came up and interrupted our vibes at the table by reaching deep into the table to get all glasses. Was Postino's short of glasses? Really? This is beyond abrasive. I can not complain about the food since we enjoyed the food and the beer and the wine.  But I can complain about the service and lack of manners and lack of sensitivity to your customers. I want to emphasize that this complaint is only directed at Postino's Arcadia. I find the other Postinos to be quite well versed on customer treatment and policy. Thank you.",

Other than that, on any given Monday or Tuesday, you won't find a better place filled with friendly staff, a collection of mesmerizing characters diversing over delish carbs that would destroy your waistline but then who's counting when you can lock eyes with the hottie across your bottle of wine? At $20 for a bruschetta board and bottle of wine, you really can't go wrong in kicking off your week on a happy note. During the rest of the week, it's good food with the ambience of a quaint spot reserved for good friends over long conversations. Noise level might be challenging for first dates, but I think it's fail proof if all you have is radio silence :)",

    "text": "A cousin I'd met in Madrid 12 years ago came to town last month, so I decided I'd take this opportunity to finally try Postino after all of these years and take her there.  It was on a Tuesday, and I was fortunate enough to stumble onto the online menu beforehand and find that Postino offers $20 bottle of wine AND bruschetta on Tuesdays after 8pm.  I was a little wary that it seemed very noisy inside, but there was no way I'd have my cousin steam outside in the patio after she had just recounted how perfect the weather was in San Francisco, a stop she'd made before arriving in PHX.    We had a blast!  For $20, the two of us enjoyed a nice bottle of Heron chardonnay and a platter of six HUGE bruschetta halves (ricotta with dates and pistachios; smoked salmon with capers and herbs; roasted red peppers and goat cheese; and prosciutto with figs and mascarpone). <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?userid=M9rRM6Eo5YbKLKMG5QiIPA#oGjoq-y0BpTf_Ug6K6vmgQ\">yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ...</a>  My non-sweet-toothed cousin's fave was the peppers and goat cheese.  It was good, but I always have red peppers and goat cheese, and since I have a ROARING sweet-tooth, my #1 fave was the ricotta, dates, and pistachios.  Tied for 2nd place were the mascarpone and salmon.  I'm not much of a prosciutto fan, as I find it a tad too salty, but the sweet mascarpone cut through some of the saltiness.  The salmon and capers were so tasty!    Nice atmosphere- lots of positive energy.  Our server was efficient, friendly, and never overbearing.  Cute restroom.  My only complaint is that it is so dark indoors!  I know I've said this before, but I'll say it again- I like to feast my eyes on the food's presentation!  Please, add more light!  <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ5QUwrNquL9VnXwl8cg?select=zsIkd6EUxXYbejAx8Srdeg#zsIkd6EUxXYbejAx8Srdeg\">yelp.com/biz_photos/u-SJ...</a>  Cousin has made me promise her I'd take her back to Postino (or perhaps someplace similar?) on her next visit.  If that isn't glowing praise for Postino, I don't know what is :)",

They have awesome happy hour specials - $5 for the equivalent of 2 glasses of wine (if that's your poison) or a mini pitcher of beer which comes out to about 2 1/2 glasses of beer. That little for booze?! Sign me up!!! Mondays (I think it's Monday...) all bottles of wine are half off! They feature a lot of local wines and hard to find wines. This is the place where I first fell in love with Moscato. I can't say enough about their Moscato except that it is delicious!  Their bruschettas are very tasty and hands down the best I've ever had. They get creative with their toppings and there's something to please palettes of all kinds. If I had to narrow down my top 4 favorites, I would choose: the apple, brie, and honey; fig, marscapone, and pistachio; the mozzarella, basil, and tomato; and finally the prosciutto and fig.  Downside - parking can be tough since this place is usually hopping. But they offer valet at a staggering price of $3. That's right - 3 bucks. Not too bad to have someone park your car 20 feet away. Also, the service can lag at times depending on how busy they are. But obviously those 2 things did very little to sway my 5 star review.",

I had looked up reviews before going and was all about ordering the bruschetta but my friends were feeling the brunch items. Everything looked so tasty! I ordered the prosciutto and Brie panini and chips. Oh my gosh soooo very flavorful!!! It was in the sweet side due to the fig but so many flavor profiles in each bite! I can't wait to come again.

My absolute favorite is the fig, prosciutto, and marscapone but they're all delicious. We were there on July 4th and it wasn't crowded but the ambiance was still great. Service was so so (our waiter forgot my husband's beer multiple times and like I said, it wasn't crowded) but we've found the service to be really good every other time we've been there. I think it was just fluky.   If you're only in Phoenix for a few days, I think Postino deserves to be on the short list of local restaurants to try.",

    "text": "I am loving the vibe of Postino! All of the locations have a real chill type setting with chill music in the background. I have now been to this location twice, first time was with a friend during their \"5 before 5\" wine deal, and while that visit was pretty good, one of the servers was obviously uneducated as to all the wines they serve there because I specifically asked if they had Moscato and he said no, but the second time I made a stop here, they most certainly did, and by far the BEST Moscato I have ever tasted if I might add! Also on the first visit, my friend and I had way too many different servers to tell who was our actual server and who we should be tipping, so that was quite odd.   My second visit here was way more enjoyable I would say, it was on a Monday evening and I was with a bigger party, and on Monday's they have a deal where you can get a bottle and a full bruschetta board for only $20! That is a great deal! Now because of such an awesome deal one should expect the place to be packed like sardines, and in this case it was no different. We all arrived at different times but it was generally around 9:30PM, unfortunately there were no tables available for 6 people even when the first people of my party arrived. So we did have to hover around the bar for a bit. One of my coworkers and I decided to share a bottle and board deal, so we ordered at the bar. About 20-25 minutes later we were finally seated and the rest of my party showed up. Here we are finally seated with our wine and bruschetta boards. My coworker did not want any bruschetta so me having limited food choices, I went with the Almond Hummus and Tomato bruschetta, and I was not disappointed one bit!! I would highly recommend that to my fellow vegan/vegetarians and even someone who just wants to try something different! This time we had only ONE server, so no confusion as to who to tip, and he was very friendly and helpful with any questions we had. All in all, I will definitely make another trip here, whenever I come back to visit Arizona!",

I did ask for the manager to see about at least turning the obnoxious music down... looked at me condescendingly to say I'll turn it down.... geez... thanks... NOT!!

    "text": "Nice surprise.....  On a way to Four Seasons from the airport we Yelped lunch restaurants and was intrigued by the reviews and menu so decided to stop by.    It is in a more industrial area not a great part of town and for a little while thought we were lost by GPS leading us to wrong direction. only to come up to a place with tiny parking lot, jammed w/valet parking only- so good sign:)  Place is very cool looking, loud (would suggest some noise cancelling options like area rugs or ceiling /wall padding), very granola like feel (reminded me of Portland and Seattle a bit), wooden tables, beautiful central vase w/amazing fresh flowers, plain bar. The best \"personal touch\" is the stamped toilet paper- def clever idea. The bathrooms are unisex and frankly when that busy should be catered to more- papers on the floor, overflowing trash, etc.  Food- started w/the butcher's block- cured meats and cheeses- very good but not very much hard cheese at all. Bruscheta tried two- the burrata, bacon tomato is fantastic, the smoked salmon average. Prosciutto panini is OK- not warm/pressed enough and bread too think so that is mostly what you taste.  Waitress wasn't that friendly (unfortunately) and did not know the wine list that well so could not describe the actual wines by the glass. Also did not offer wine list per bottle which we would have ordered as better selection.  Overall nice place to come experiment if you are a foodie.",

Ate here on a Sunday after church,  not to busy as compared to dinner time.  Valet service for the car which parking is very limited.   Not a drinker of wine or beer so automatically limited our choices of the place which very much revolves around the wine selection.   Had the Autostrada Panini with the salad and the food was just not that great tasting. There was barely any meat in the sandwich. The Panini was ok but the combination of dressing and meat was not to my taste.   I could see how this place could have a great concept with the wine bar, but for food they need to put more effort and expand the menu.",

We were served, but never checked on. I ordered a salad which had NO dressing at all, so I flagged down another waiter and asked him for salad dressing, but everyone in my party (7 total) was already done eating by the time I started eating. The salad was gross. They put the inedible type of letters and sandwich sliced turkey in it! Yuck. The bruschetta was actually good. Not coming back.

At times service can be a bit slow and inattentive; sometimes it takes a bit to get water refills and occasionally drinks take a bit of time. However, this place is rockin' and there's a wait for tables for a REASON.

The beverage I enjoyed was the cucumber honey lemonade. It was good, but it tasted a little more on the cucumber flavor side which is great if that's what you desire! For the appetizer We tried the Bruschetta which on its own was a lot of food! You get to make four selections. We went with Brie & Apples with Fig Spread, Warm Artichoke Spread, Ricotta with Dates and Pistachios, and Salami with Pesto. My favorite out of them was oddly the Ricotta with Dates and Pistachios, it tasted like a desert to me and was very yummy! For the main course I tried the Smoked Salmon. It wasn't what I was expecting but it was still good! I took the toasted marble rye and spread the dill cream cheese on it and topped it with the salmon and gastrique onions. If you love trying new things, then Postinos is a place you will love! I have a very open mind when it comes to trying new food, so I'll try anything twice! This is a place I would enjoyably return to! The service here was also perfect! I came with my fiance, my son, Dad, Mom and Brother. The waitress never let us get low on drinks and she was very polite. If you like to drink, they also have a full bar and almost as many wines as a grocery store! Don't let anyone live your experience, come eat at Postinos and experience the positive energy yourself!",

I got an order of four: salami and pesto, smoke salmon, prosciutto, and dates and pistachios. The best was salami and pesto. I could eat that all day, in fact I make it occasionally at home after having it here. Need to find an place in my area that has these.",

I met my girlfriend there for my birthday lunch (gifts on table, etc.) and nothing was ever mentioned about a possible occasion we were celebrating, etc.  That was just the base layer of the cake in what was to come in terms of horrible customer service.  We ordered a tuna panini and their raspberry salad.  I lost my appetite halfway through my salad when I bite into something that almost broke a tooth and didn't touch the rest of my meal (again nothing mentioned/or inquiry made by our server as to how our meal were!).  My friends tuna panini was dry and she only ate a small portion of hers as well.  As we sat there enjoying conversation, we had a different server come up and tell us if we were going to be staying longer, they'd have to reseat us because they had a party coming in at 2.  Really?!  Isn't that a bit rude!  How about REALLY rude!  I asked her if we could have 5 minutes and she replied \"she though she could allow that to happen\".   Well sure enough, right at the 5 minute mark, she came and told us we'd have to be reseated if we were going to be staying longer.    In any case, I won't be frequenting Postino's anymore.  There are wayyyyy too many good restaurants in Phoenix and even in the corridor of 40th and Campbell to go back to a place that honestly doesn't care about its customers.  Way to go Postino's!",

Monday and Tuesday they offer any bottle of wine and a board of bruschetta (any four choices) for $20. It's an outstanding deal and very worth it. Highly recommended bruschetta options include: the fig, mascarpone, and prosciutto; the bacon and buratta; the smoked salmon and pesto; and the roasted red pepper and goat cheese.   Additionally, while their Monday and Tuesday deal (and the bruschetta generally) is what they are known for, their brunch is also top notch. I absolutely love the BELT breakfast sandwich and the farm scramble. Outstanding.   I prefer the downtown Phoenix location myself, but both offer lovely indoor and outdoor seating, trendy vibes, good group space, and attentive knowledgeable service. I no longer live in the area but always make a point of coming when I'm in town.  Highly recommend.",

If you come in for the bruschetta board and wine night, prepare to wait, but know that it will be worth it! (It's a great deal, and everyone that's tried it comes back for more..) Brunch there is my favorite, and on a Saturday, it's not too crowded. $5 glasses of wine, pitchers of beer, mimosas and bellinis make it a reasonable meal, and the food is incredible! If it's your first visit, absolutely try the bruschetta (it's a LOT of food to order 4). My fave is a tie between the prosciutto + fig and the bacon + tomato. They're so delicious, you can't go wrong!! The paninis are well-made, hot and (like everything at Postino...) fresh! I love the turkey one with a small salad instead of chips.  If the food doesn't make you smile, the polite and prompt service will! We already can't wait to go back and dine with them again soon.",

Searching for a spot for lunch while tooling around town I stopped in and found this nice little spot.  There is a fairly well appointed wine selection here as well as a good assortment of food.  The Turkey panini was quite tasty, consisting of smoked turkey, provolone, tomato, fresh greens and house-made pesto. Service was friendly and reasonably quick.  The general atmosphere of Postino Arcadia is one of relaxation with friends on a leisurely Sunday morning, getting out and just enjoying a bite with friends. I generally prefer the Kierland location simply for the patio area, but whenever in the downtown area, this is an ideal spot for an outing.",

In Gilbert, you can't get wine to go unless the bottle is opened so the Arcadia location is useful for picking up something on the racks to take home.

Come to find out they could only do olives truly gf once they found out it was a True allergy.  We were told by several different people that many items were gluten free; such as the sandwiches, but upon further questions about the meats, cheeses, etcetera being GF, they took back their reassurances. Close call to being poisoned!",

    "text": "Postino has 3 locations around the Valley!  I've been to 2 of them now and the one thing you can say about Postino, they are an amazing place to dine/drink and they are very consistent with service, quality and ambiance.    We typically go the Postino on Central, however we dined here a couple of weeks ago with some friends and found them to be fantastic! I really like the patio area!! It was too cold for us on this trip however this is a \"must come back\" kinda of place just to enjoy a great meal on their patio!!  Food~ if your dining for lunch go straight to the salads and/or bruschettas!!  Their portions are actually larger than you think and after you pick and choose some of the different ones to eat, you'll thank me for passing on the apps!!    However if you re dinning for dinner or have a larger group or a huge appetite, then go ahead and order some apps.  I suggest trying their Bella Postino~ warm artichoke dip and white bean hummus with assorted breads or their Butcher's Block~ with different artisan meats and cheeses served with Tuscan beans, olives, nuts and crostini.  Both are DELISH!    Bruschetta's~ here are some of our faves;  Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone, the Smoked Salmon with Pesto is my go to!! The Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomato is also a go to!  We also like to try their seasonal burchettas as well!    Paninis~ go for the prosciutto with brie or their Nine Iron with smoked bacon layered with grilled chicken, fresh burrata mozzarella, lettuce, beefsteak tomato and special sauce = nom.nom.nom!!   Service~  our service was a little slower than what we are used to at their Central location however our server was very friendly, knew the menu well and tried her best to keep up.  All in all it was a FANTASTIC experience!! My friends and I are looking forward to coming back on a Monday or Tuesday when they have their $20 special, a bottle of wine and burchetta ~ put me down for 2 please! I hope to see you there.",

Although I don't believe they are associated with the restaurant I think they are outsourced. The tomato jam is great! The iron skillet sandwich and all the bruschetta and mixed green salads are great. I didn't get a chance to try the Cream Brule because I was overly stuffed but, that's next. They also had a cute brunch menu and since I do love a good brunch I will check them out.",

    "text": "I didn't think I could love anyplace as much as Postino Central... but I stand corrected.  After finally making it to the Arcadia location, I must say that I loved it equally, but differently.    Arcadia seemed a little more comfortable with a relaxed vibe.   The perfect spot to have a casual chat and some noshes, without having to get all done up or break the bank.    My favorites are still: bruschetta board (especially prosciutto with fig & mascarpone), mixed greens salad, and the salted caramel sundae - all are perfect for sharing!  the parking situation is a bit of a nightmare.  The valet is free, but only if you are going to LGO... So as a Postino's patron, you will need to pay $3 for this service.  you might be better off in the free parking across the street near the Arcadia Room.  TIP - Be sure to sign up for their email list for birthday & anniversary specials!",

    "text": "So, I'll keep this short and sweet, since reviewing Postino's is like writing a review of your best friend - there is never enough space and there is no doubt I will forget something!   But in general, I always have a great time at Postino's! Love, luv, luhv the brushetta with my favs right now being fig and prosciutto, brie with apples, the white bean and pesto and salami! You also can't go wrong with their salads and sandwiches! Plus, I heart that the GF BF can make his own brushetta experience by ordering the platter off the appetizers list! It's basically a deconstructed brushetta platter with all the fixins!!   The by the glass wines are usually very good, although they mostly will be ones you have never heard of! Never a bad thing to try something new! Their by the bottle selection rocks and I so appreciate their few nods to Washington wines like DeLille etc!   Finally, what makes me love Postino's aside from my wonderful company, are the servers! I have to show some love for Dominic, who is simply wonderful and always takes such good care of us (thanks for picking out all the bright green olives for us yesterday!) He is GF too so he feels the plight of all of you trying to avoid that evil flour! Also a treat to see Troy as well!   Finally, don't miss the $5 glasses before 5 pm on all days, including Sat and Sunday! It may make me slow on Monday morning, but at least I'm still smiling from the memories!! Thanks Posties!!",

Our attentive servers brought us water right away. I started with fresh squeezed lemonade then had a mimosa. My friend and a bellini and the guys had some IPA (I think it was $5 a pitcher??)

The parking lot was packed so we opted to valet which was only $3. We got here at 7:30 and although they quoted us about a 25 minute wait, we only waited about 15 minutes.   The outside patio is pretty cute with the lights and bushes and they have heaters to keep you warm on a chilly night.   You can choose ANY bottle on their menu and get a board of bruschetta for $20. We went with a bottle of a California Cab (delicious, I almost drank the whole bottle myself), a board of bruschetta, and the nine iron panini. Mike is a pretty picky eater, but I thought I was going to have to fight him for one of the pieces of prosciutto with figs & mascarpone he liked it so much. I love getting him to try new things and even more so when he actually likes them. The smoked salmon with pesto and warm artichoke pieces were also delish. The nine iron was also very tasty. The bacon and mozzarella were definitely the stars of this dish. The mozzarella just melted in your mouth.   The staff here was so friendly. Our water glasses were never empty and someone was always checking in on us. I was also walked to the bathroom when I asked where it was.  Thanks for making our first visit so great!",

A few other sisters vouched for their bruschetta, so the bf and I didn't think we'd go wrong there. All of the different kinds we tried were delicious! So much that we ordered another 4 with our 2 favorites. Can't go wrong... just pick one! Or 4... since they come served that way.

I mentioned a few places like the Vig, El Chorro, even Tee Pee for a few libations.  She texted back that simplicity was the goal and wine was needed.  Postino, here we come.  Only a minute walk from home (had to through that in!) and never a need to find parking!  Waited only 5-10 minutes for a table.  Miles is always quick with water and olives for starting off.  We ordered the bruschetta, of course (Brie & Apples 2x, Prosciutto/Fig, Salmon.)  She was craving a spanish tempranillo and I settled on a zinfandel.  Talking, eating, drinking, lounging ensued...  Then, the phone starts ringing, a few different calls lining up the weekend, climbing etc.  Dhargya called and he mentioned that he and friend were heading to Postino Central, a quick re-direct and they were on the way here.  Wouldn't you rather join good friends?  They arrived and of course Postino staff is very accommodating.  Chairs were brought over immediately, wine and champagne ordered quickly.  Another great evening with great friends at the best Wine Bar in Phoenix!   Try the happy hour special one day soon and avoid waiting for a table or attempting to find parking, 11am-5pm $5 wine glasses.  Perfect place for catching up with friends at 3pm in the afternoon.",

On a beautiful sunny day the doors of the old post office are open ,creating a breezy inviting atmosphere.  Begin your meal with the plate; an assortment of goodies all piled onto a cheese board. Next enjoy the brie and prosciutto sandwich with fig spread. Pair it with a $5 glass of Prosecco or a big bold Cab and you have yourself a relaxing and enjoyable day with buddies. You can't beat it!  After lunch you can even walk next door to LGO and shop for goodies! Gifts, Children's books, Candles, deserts by Tammie Coe, and wine!",

    "text": "Last night I made my second trip to Postino and was in the company of a very lovely young woman. Lucky me :) I had been to this location one other time, but I wasn't there very long and I forgot what I ate. SO, i was really looking forward to this trip. Plus, Amber W was kind enough to give me a gift card for Christmas. Thanks Amber!   The parking here is sort of on the ridiculous side because the lot is so small. You have to valet your vehicle. I think it was $3. It was busy when we arrived and were quoted about 25 minutes. So we went over to the waiting area to start with some wine. We didn't even have a chance to order because our table was ready already. We were seated outside and I feared for my date's life because it was a little chilly and I don't think the dress she was wearing was really made for winter nights. Thankfully there was a heater planted right behind her.   Our server took our drink orders promptly. I had the Tierra de Luna Malbec. Very good. She had a Reisling, which was very sweet and fruity. Started with the bruschetta and holy schnikes! I could have eaten this all night. We opted for the Smoked Salmon with capers and Pesto, the Tomato, Basil, & Mozzarella, the Ricotta with pistachios and dates, and the Brie with apples and fig spread. All of them were amazing! I am not a salmon fan, but this smoked salmon was delicious! It was also my first attempt at Brie. This too was good.   For the meal, my lady friend or special lady, (Big Lebowski random quote) had the Raspberry Chicken salad. It was chunky chicken salad on a bed of greens with a raspberry vinaigrette. I was told it was good. I went for the half panini and soup combo. I had the Vegetarian with the Tomato and Gorgonzola soup. Originally the wrong panini came out. The server got it replaced and put the wrong one in a to go box to take home. Thought that was nice for the mix up. The soup was excellent. It is a very close second to The Roosevelt's tomato soup. The Vegetarian panini was good, but could have used a little more veggies on it.   Unfortunately there was no room for dessert, but they all sounded amazing. Overall, a great experience with great food and drink. Service was great and the atmosphere was perfect.   Again, thanks Amber W for the gift!!!",

Fantastic bruschetta, amazing little chocolate dessert of yumminess, and glorious vino. Not to mention that the wait staff is super friendly and they \"share\" tables in a way that seems to work well!   Even though the $20 deal for a bottle of wine and bruschetta was amazing, the wait was pretty long (upwards of an hour) in the 100 degree heat on Monday/Tuesday evenings. We learned after one time to avoid the crowd after 8pm on Monday/Tuesday and stick to Sundays or Wednesdays at Postino.  I highly recommend it.",

The only downside to this location is the the music is louder inside so an intimate conversation would be difficult unless your on the patio. However I will continue to come back over and over again!",

    "text": "So, you're saying that I can get ANY bottle off of the list AND my choice of bruschetta for only $20. What's that? I can start my bottle now and easily move with my meal and my server once my table is ready? And you say that I can do this on Monday and AGAIN on Tuesday, starting at 8pm? Every week? Can this be True?  Thank you, Postino, for having the best wine and food deal in the valley, and creating a great atmosphere in which to enjoy wine with friends.   I love wine. So do lots of other people that show up at 8pm sharp, rain or shine, to take advantage of the awesome Monday/Tuesday special. So be prepared to wait for a seat. If you are sharp like a hawk or stealthy like a fox, you might catch one of those coveted bar seats, but otherwise you'll stand at small tables, casually drinking your wine and doing some people watching until the host finds you and guides you to your table. You will love your wine selection. Your bruschetta will be made with the the freshest ingredients on crusty MJ bread, in the perfect proportions. Do try my favorites: Prosciutto, mascarpone, & fig; Red peppers & goat cheese; Ricotta with pistachio & dates; and Pesto with smoked salmon. Happiness served on a wood-cutting board. I paired my bruschetta with a spicy corn chowder, and it was just the best meal for a rainy night.   The servers are very cool and know what they are talking about. They will not steer you wrong with a wine selection. If you order a bottle that is not to your liking, no problem! They serve all wine by the glass, so you can easily send it back and try another! They want you to enjoy your experience and selection, and thus have built in the flexibility for people to take risks and try new wines. Have fun with it!   My suggestion is to find a friend or two, valet the car, put your name in for a table, get started on a bottle, make laughter and conversation, and finally take your seats, enjoy your food, and order more wine. You will be fully satisfied and will have had a great night. Do recommend it to your other friends, and definitely make plans to return again soon.",

    "text": "As the great Adam Richman says, \"Oh my goodness..oh..my..goodness\" Hands down the BEST restaurant Ive eaten at in Pheonix thus far! Had no idea what to expect coming to this restaurant while attending a conference over the past week, but a friend (who is now a local---tear) suggested this restaurant because of thier great happy hour. (Every Monday and Tuesday night after 8pm, $20 for a bottle of wine and bruschetta) We missed the happy hour but now that Ive had thier homemade bruschetta...who cares! I would come back again and again even without the discounted food.  This restaurant is quaint and cute. Sort of small and tucked away behind a random street (obviously Im not a local Phoenix-er) But they have this cute little outdoors area with a fireplace and bar, and when you are in a hot little town in the middle of the dessert, its nice to be outdoors and enjoy the warmth at night, something we dont get to enjoy too often in SF. Im sure many of the other plates at this restaurant are delicious as well, but their specialty by far has to be their bruschetta! Almost any type of concoction and combo you can think of to go on flaky/crispy baquettes, this restaurant has come up with. None of the bruschetta's that I tried were dissapointing. Let me start by saying, this place is a \"share with everyone\" type of restaurant, which, I have no problems with because then I get to pig out and taste everyones's plates. haha! So, I literally tasted almost every type of bruschetta that was on the menu. Let me start with the Brie and Apples with Fig spread- this almost tasted like a dessert because the tangyness of the apples. The Tomato jam with fresh sheeps milk cheese could also be had for dessert. This actually may have been my most favorite out of all the bruschettas! The cheese was sooo creamy, you could eat it with a spoon. That mixed together with the sweetness of the tomato jam------heaven..... Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone The Warm Artichoke Spread was mighty tasty and fresh and this coming from a girl who grew up in the \"artichoke capital of the world\"  Burrata, Bacon, Arugula & Tomatoes- Adding burrata to anything cant be anything but delicious! And knowing that, I, a corndog/bacon LOVER think that this combo will rock anyone's world. Um, hello.....bacon! Salami with Pesto- the salami was tasty and spicy and together with the homemade pesto was the perfect combo for a warm night.  I will come back to this restaurant next time I am in town for spring training, hell Ill prob eat here every night Im in town!",

It is such a cute little place in an old post office that opens up so there is an inside area and also a patio area but the inside area is breezy and still sort of outdoors. Their bruschetta is soooo good! My favorites are the apple & brie and also the roasted peppers with goat cheese. Their sandwiches, salads and soups are all really good as well. I never leave here feeling grossly full or guilty about what I ate, everything is fresh and the portions are good. There is tons of different wine and they are very informative and thorough if you ask about the wine selections! Well priced, great place to meet up with friends or go on a date. I've never had a bad experience here--service, food, wine, all good.Cute location too. I would suggest doing the Valet parking because spaces to park are extremely limited. There is a small parking lot across the street but it fills up fast. Also, if you sign up to be on their email list, you get a coupon for a free plank of bruschetta!!",

Keeps it fun and exciting! Now don't even get me started on the bruschetta! My boyfriend and I crave it all the time and could probably eat it seven days a week. Last, if you go there between 11am-5pm any day of the week any wine is $5. What could be a better deal than that?",

    "text": "Love the Postino Arcadia location. If you are in Phoenix and like wine, this is a hidden gem. Located right off of Campbell and  40th. There is a small parking lot and most nights it is Valet. Try the Bruschetta Board or the Proscuitto and Fig sandwich, on Chibatta of course, you will not be disappointed. It's $5 glasses of wine any day (including weekends) until 5pm... did I mention this deal was EVERYDAY?  I also love the ambiance at the Arcadia location, it's what the Central location is just missing a little of. The music is normally alternative and hip, on any given night you will see several patrons using their smartphones to run SoundHound or Shazaam apps to find out what music they are playing.  Since I moved away from Phoenix and down to Tucson I really miss this place, but whenever I am up I make a point to get to Postino. As the bumper sticker says \"Drinking Wine at Lunch is Not a Crime.\" The only reason I'm giving it 4 stars and not 5 is due to parking.",

    "text": "I finally made it to Postino! Nobody ever wanted to go with me and I was finally able to talk my friend into going to the one next to my hair dresser. Arcadia!    Like I said, I went with a friend for lunch and it was so freaking delicious!  I ordered the Prosciutto with Brie Panini, which includes...  Prosciutto with triple cream brie, fig jam and arugula. I think they spread honey or something else on the bread.   I would like to say my friend was really hesitant to go because she just didn't like Postino based on past experiences.   However, she had gone to the location on central, not Arcadia. This info will be important later. Back to my yummy panini.   I have never been crazy about prosciutto but Brie...one of my fav cheeses. Add sweet fruityness to it and I'm sold!   Based on the options on the menu this sounded like the best choice for me and I am so glad I know myself so well.  The generous amount of meat combined with the perfect amount of cheese on great bread all brought together with this amazing sweet spread and some healthy greenage.   I mean it was probably one of the greatest things I have eaten in a long time.   This was so True that 3 days later I told my husband we are going for lunch as I must eat this sandwich again! This time we went to the central location.   So not the same. :(  The meat portion was half and the brie was just off and my sandwich was just not spectacular. Hence why I think my friend was against Postino for so long. She had only ever been to central.   So I highly recommend Postino but I can only recommend the Arcadia location and it's the only one I will go to. Even though it's far for me, it's worth the drive past the central location onto Arcadia.   Not joking....Amazing! Eat it!",

I am always left satisfied and with a smile. My top favorite panini i the Roast Beef, which is basically wood roasted beef with aged port salut cheese, onions, and the crispiest pickles ever. My second favorite is the Chicken & Mozzarella, which has grilled chicken with mozzarella, arugula, and spicy sun dried tomato mayo. I'm not a fan of the tomato mayo so I got it with just regular mayo. But hands down you gotta tr the Roast Beef.  If you put in an order of bruschetta, you get to pick 4 categories. My top 4 are White Bean with Chopped Tomato (i thought i was going to hate it, but it actually turned out to be my most favorite now), Warm Artichoke, Roasted Peppers with Goat Cheese, and Tomato & Basil.  This place can get kind of loud, but nothing too wild to make me annoyed. The service was friendly, although I will say that I wish they had checked up on us more than just once. Coming by our table asking how everything is while I'm in the middle of my first bite doesn't really count.",

As far as locations go, I think Gilbert has the best food overall followed by Postino Arcadia and then Postino Central, but I would give all of them 5 stars except Postino Central which I gave 4 (due to freshness of ingredients).    If this is your first time trying Postino, you MUST try the bruschetta. It is out of this world. I've been to a couple of different other places that seem as if they are trying to copy Postino's bruschetta, but it is never as good.   Aside from the bruschetta, the salads are wonderful, all of them, my favorite being the italian picnic.   Most importantly, the wine is amazing at Postino. If you are not sure which to try, ALWAYS try the Postino exclusive. It will never let you down. All the locations except for Gilbert will let you take home an unfinished bottle which is really nice also. Even better, on Mondays and Tuesdays if you come at 8pm they have their special - any bottle of wine AND a tray of bruschetta! It cannot be beat!!",

Didn't know exactly what to expect but I walked away knowing i would miss it.  My friend and I ordered the sparkling Rose wine along with an order of their Brushchetta.  Oh delicious!  The way their bruschetta menu works, is you choose 4 toppings for $12.75. It is served on full, thick slices of delightfully soft, perfectly crusted Italian bread.  My favorite was the Prosciutto with Figs & Mascarpone (favorite).  Although I also ordered the mozzarella and basil....I didn't care for it as it sat next to the first variety. :) Yummo!  The best part is...on Monday and Tuesdays, there's a special! Our total would have been about 45 bucks (bottle of wine roughly $25 and Brushchetta $12.75), we walked away paying a little over $20!  Can't wait to come back to Phoenix for this little haven. :)  If you are a local patron, stop by.  You won't regret it. :)",

    "text": "Time to share some opinions here that the majority might not agree with...  Sandra Bullock is a horrible actress  High School was NOT the best time of my life  Postino Winecafe does not live up to the hype  ...while I write this, I of course realize that most people sadly somehow enjoy Sandra Bullock films, think High School was a blast, and...at least according to the reviews on Yelp, adore Postino Winecafe.   The food is decent enough...bruschetta was flavorful (although on our last visit the bread was a little hard) and the Pub Board appetizer is amazing. The main gripe we have with this place is the service. Do you have to spend a lot of money on alcohol or look like a hipster here to get good service or what? We went for a light meal...nothing more. I don't see a sign on the door that says 'must buy wine', so why did our waiter treat us like a couple of vagrants while he was overly friendly to tables around us who were spending more money? I get it...higher bill, higher tip...this is no excuse for bad service though. A paying customer is a paying customer. The disparity in service couldn't have been more painfully obvious, and that's a shame. Maybe we went on an off night...or maybe Postino is getting cocky...who knows?  We had a decent meal, but left feeling like outsiders instead of valued guests. Maybe next time if I wear a 'deep V-neck' and Katrina wears some 'jeggings', we'll appear wealthier and get better service. Eh.  3.25/5.",

I mainly go here for the Bruschetta on Mon and Tues nights after 8pm for their $20 wine bottle and bruschetta board (feeds 2).  Favorite Bruschetta:  1 - Salmon, 2- Apple and Brie with Fig Jam, 3- Prosciutto, fig, and marscapone, 4- White Bean.  Honestly, I could eat there every single day.",

    "text": "There's not much more I can say about Postino than hasn't already been said... the food is incredible, the wine list is extensive, the menu is reasonably priced, the ambiance is delightful, and the service rocks!  I was there last night and enjoyed the $20 bottle of wine + bruschetta deal after 8 p.m. The portions on the bruschetta deal were surprisingly generous, and amazingly delicious! I went with the mozzarella with tomato and basil, the goat cheese with roasted peppers, the smoked salmon with pesto, and ricotta with dates and pistachios; I loved the first three, but I would not order the date and pistachio bruschetta on my next visit.   I also ordered the \"pick two\" panini and salad/\"soup of the moment\" combo, with the Brie and prosciutto panini and a healthy serving of tomato soup. The panini was scrumptious! It was perfectly prepared, and tasted amazing ... I wish I had ordered the full sandwich! The soup was just OK - it wasn't bad, but it was nowhere near as exciting for my tastebuds as the panini.   I would liken my dining experience at Postino to \"If You Give a Mouse a Cookie\" -- after I had one phenomenal item, I had to have them all! After polishing off a bold and zesty Syrah from California, I ended up leaving with a bottle of the Reunion Malbec from Mendoza, Argentina. Restaurant patrons receive $9 off bottles of wine to-go, so I mean, I wasn't gonna not... (perfectly acceptable use of double negatives).  Although it is a trendy spot, Postino has somehow managed to remain friendly and unpretentious - both staff and guests alike. The servers all know their stuff and are more than happy to provide recommendations based on your preferences. Even the least sophisticated palate will feel comfortable dining here on account of the helpful service and charming atmosphere; hence why I hereby award Postino with my first 5/5 star review!   Aproveche, my friends!",

The prosciutto and brie, apples and fig spread, warm artichoke spread, and the baratta and bacon brisket are amazing. those are the ones i will always order.  2. For 20 bucks you can get this Delicious food AND a bottle of some of the best pinot noir (which usually costs 11 bucks a glass!!!)  3. Its the perfect place for a date, and a cheap one at that, on mondays and tuesdays. or a girls night out.   the only complaint is the wait on mondays and tuesdays. the hostess told us it was an 80 minute wait. it only ended up being 40....wtf. haha",

The prosciutto, cheese and fig is my favorite. This is a wonderful date spot and is perfectly lit for a romantic evening. Maybe a tad loud and the wait may be long, but worth it!!! Check this place out. There is one being built on Gilbert Rd in Old Town Gilbert so no more long drives to my favorite spot!!!",

I think that's a good menu for lunch, but if you dine there for dinner they should have a few entrees to choose from like a pasta dish or something more flavorful. When you eat sandwitches at dinner it just feels wrong, especially if you just have time for a dinner date. However what keeps people coming is the dim hip atmoshere, the open layout, the wine and the twinkle lighted patio. Parking is a bitch, so bring cash for the Valet.",

The only reason I didn't give it 5 stars is solely because there's practically no reason for me to go here, which may be my own damn fault for being a relative homebody given my employment (concierge). I wouldn't go here for an after-shift glass of wine, just because I know it will be swamped. And especially if I'm alone I will avoid this place. And if I'm looking for romance, well, the packed thing nixes that idea and they don't take reservations. I would suggest this place, however, for cougars and other single types.",

Cute lil place...very romantic if you were on a date.  The menu is very simple ranging from paninis and salads.  Since Danielle and I wanted the same two paninis from the menu, we decided to get both and split it.  We ordered the mozzarella/basil/pesto panini and the chicken/mozzarella/spicy mayo.  We loved both and the side salad that accompanied the meal was delicious.  I also highly recommend the mimosa with the fresh squeezed orange juice!  It's AMAZING!",

We got there just in time to get happy hour drink prices,$5 for wine so we each grabbed a glass real fast and sat and chatted. Happy hour ends at 5 btw so go early. The crowd was light at 5 and we chatted for a good hour or so before ordering our first bruschetta board. You get 4 pieces of each selection and you can select 4 different types. The apple fig one was amazing of course the classic tomato mozzarella was to die for. The prosciutto and date melted in your mouth! We gnawed on that for about 30 mins then ordered another to try 4 more! We sat and chatted drinking just water and they kept filling our water glasses and in the 3 hours that we were there and while their waiting list portables grew they didn't rush us out of there at all. This is definitely going to be a staple on my hang out list now that I live closer!",

They don't have it on the menu, but they do have moscato d'asti for all those who like sweet and fizzy wines! :)  The bellinis are delish, with lots of yummy peach puree waiting for you like a treat at the bottom of the glass.  The bruschetta is ALWAYS on point!  My favorites are the smoked salmon with pesto and the tomato jam with sheepsmilk cheese.  DELISH!  For dessert, they have a salted caramel sundae with fresh, homemade salted caramel!  If you're a fan of salted caramel, you will absolutely LOVE this!  I haven't yet made it out on Sunday to try the sangria and listen to the reggae, but I plan on doing so soon!

Parking was kiiind of a pain...not many spots to park in. They have valet parking but when you don't have a bill on you it makes valet diffifult (valet guy was nice polite and friendly).
