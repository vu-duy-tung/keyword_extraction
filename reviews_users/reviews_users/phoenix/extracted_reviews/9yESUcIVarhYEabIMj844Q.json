The service can be hit or miss, with some being attentive and others not so much. I do enjoy that it is part of the Yard. They do have ping pong, foosball, and cornhole games. I personally like coming on weekday nights when it's far less crowded.",

I never really write reviews but my friend was so impressed and loved this place he encouraged me to. The food was absolute amazing but one of the reason I come in there is to see Sara the bartender.  I think her last name starts with an S. She always has this bright smile on her face and laughing and welcoming. Love that she remembers my name and face and says hello.  She went through the menu with my friend and made some great suggestions on what to order. He picked the Ribs and I got the Korean Ribeye. Both were delicious. Sara was quick with the order and getting us our drinks. Never had an empty glass and she was on top on everything the whole time.  I am a big foodie person but the main reason I go back to places is because of the service I receive. I will come back and def make this place a suggestion mainly because of the customer service I receive from Sara.",

    "text": "I went here with my girlfriend for Valentine's day. We made reservations for 730pm. When we arrived we asked to sit on the patio, the host told me he'd text me in about 5 minutes and we went to the bar to wait. 20 minutes later I went back to him to ask about the seat. He didn't know what I was talking about and had to re-look me up. They then immediately sat us.   I ordered the meat loaf and tomato soup, she ordered salmon. The soup was awesome. My meatloaf was really good, but the mashed potatoes were watery and cold. The green beans were cold as well. The prices are a bit high ($15 for a single slice of meatloaf and a small cold pile of green beans and mashed potatoes.)   Her salmon was weird as it sat on what tasted and looked like oatmeal, but she seemed to like it. Our waiter (William) whom never greeted us or checked on us, was too busy socializing and taking pictures of tables, to even ask if she wanted a wine refill or if I wanted a beer refill. He continued to socialize and BS after he took my card for about 20 minutes before I got it back.   My suggestion to the restaurant: keep your food hot, your customers drinks full and maybe invest in those vibrating pagers rather than offering a \"text message\".  The valet guys were cool though...  My suggestion to other customers: don't.",

We often go as a big group, sharing several of their appetizer options (veggies and hummus, chips and cheese, pretzel bites, etc.) and the pork belly nachos (LEGIT)! The place is huge and has very trendy/hipster vibe. They've generally got a lot of great beers on tap, so check out the draft list if you're into it. My only real complaint is how slow service can be sometimes. It's been pretty hit or miss for us, but if you can get someone that's on top of their game, it's a great experience!",

I don't know you, please get up and back away!  A few of the waitresses were dressed cute enough, but one girl looked ridiculous!  We actually saw her walking south on 7th St on our way to the restaurant and both my husband and I commented that it was a little early in the day for that type of enterprise. Imagine our surprise when a few minutes later we see her seating guests in the restaurant!   I had the Pub Burger. It was cooked perfectly, with just the right amount of grill flavor!  My husband had the Prime Rib sandwich.  He liked it except for the cheese.  The fries seemed fresh, but could have been served hotter.    I do not believe I will return, nor would I recommend to others.  Too many good places to tantalize my tastebuds to waste my time or money coming back to Culinary Dropout.  Maybe they should have stayed in!",

The food here is mediocre & to be honest, overpriced.. & their best thing on the menu is the Beer Cheese Pretzels.  The thing that irks me about the games is that there is always long wait times & people can check out the equipment & then go back & sit at their table for however long without even actually using it.  I'll keep coming back because its a cool place to hang out, especially if youre with a large group, but I'll probably make sure to frequent the Tempe location since it seems like that one is a little more organized & well kept.",

Our waitress was extremely patient with our somewhat unorganized group of 7. The food was amazing! Our group ordered the fried chicken, pierogies, nachos, wings, pretzel bread and cheese. Everything was super tasty and hit the spot.  Our cocktails were also delicious... one star came off due to waiting on drinks.

It took another 15 minutes and she came by and said do you need anything else or any boxes since most of our food was not eaten. Told her know and why. She then said the kitchen must of spilt the aju because I'm always careful and that the fish is a big seller.. Do you need anything else I said yes my check and the manager. She said okay but we're really busy. Walking away waited BTW we told her leave our plates to show manager. But no such luck no one came left my cash and no tip with a note on receipt to be called by manager.. Never got a call. I really didn't think I would but wanted someone to know the issues.",

Shared antipassi.  Had we understood more about how blockbuster good it is we would have selected all the options and just had that.  I asked the waitress to recommend Shrimp salad vs tuna salad and was shocked when she said shrimp because if tuna salad is served seared normally kicks shrimp's ass.  Two of us ordered it and were terribly disappointed.  I agree with another yelper it was a tiny fried popcorn shrimp salad.  I also agree with another yelper - the place is inconsistent.  They need some mystery diners to fine tune their offering.  All that being said I will go again with another group of people and have a totally different experience because we will choose to sit at the bar and drink, snack on the antipassi and listen to music.",

I think the menu price is high since there is no soup or salad or potatoes included.  My friend had the barbequed ribs served with fries and slaw.  The slaw left a lot to be desired as it was dry and I prefer my slaw creamy and no vinegar in the sauce.  The ribs were just OK as the sauce was not up to my taste standards nor my friends.  I thought a little spicy whereas I prefer mine to be sweet.   Tried the tomato soup but did not like whatever spices they used. For dessert we shared a chocolate tart which was great.   Since my friends does not drink and I do not drink alcohol I had one of my favorite beers (Kiltlifter).  They do have Moose Drool but were not serving it that afternoon. I may try this place sometime for lunch as prices may be more afordable then. My favoites tastes were the crispy bread, trout, and the tart.",

    "text": "This Culinary Drop out is a really fun location. Connected to two other restaurants and a common area with sitting areas and games like ping-pong and bean toss its a really fun and energetic place to go. I love it, I really do and have been a couple times now. The staff and management are fantastic and do a great job with serving and keeping people happy. I only have two complaints. One is that the menu seems to have allot of sweet dishes. I'm a girl who loves sweet things but not on my main dishes. The meatloaf that my fiance had ordered came to our table with a sweet tomato based glaze of some kind, and my fried chicken was supposed to be drizzled in honey, which I ordered on the side. When we asked about why the meatloaf was sweet we were told that it was \"traditional\" meatloaf..... Well, I grew up having my mom's meatloaf being savory, not sweet. So maybe I'm not aware of this being common. Needless to say they removed it from out bill to accommodate us which was very nice. My second complaint is the cost of the drinks. 10.00 a pop across the board for mixed drinks is awfully hefty in my opinion for being a place that clearly attracts people in there 20's-late 30's. for a group of five, each having two drinks each is 100.00 dollars? ouch! Although there is nothing to say with the quality or quantity of the drinks. Overall I can say I will keep going back despite these two things. The pretzel bites are probably my favorite app to order and you can stick to cheaper beer and wine. They have bands on the weekend and its a place a cant stay away from.",

We were seated at 8:50 it took us over an hour to get 3 sandwiches. I had the grilled chicken club and my chicken was burnt and bitter. The bun was so soaked in whatever sauce they had on it that it fell apart when I picked it up. It was a mess. My fiance got the prime rib dip and his food smelled just like dog food. Our friends split the Italian sandwich and they were happy with it. The fresh pretzels are the only reason I give this place 2 stars. The staff was nice but it's so hard to distinguish the difference between employees and customers. Very casually dressed no name tags. Might give the Las Vegas location a shot assuming service might be a little better but won't be returning to this location",

It used to be a motorcycle dealership and they should win an award for best redesign and reuse of a building in Phoenix. It's totally a great place to meet with friends and just drink and hang out. The food is alright, but more diversified than the Scottsdale location. My only gripe is you cannot go on the weekend nights without a reservation (have to call a week ahead and have a large party) but that's what happens when you open a successful new place. Also, ask for Austen, great server!!!",

Fried chicken at $5 a piece is dry with heavy coating and once again sweet.  I know it is hot in phoenix but having so many customers fanning themselves from heat is not a good sign. Disappointed",

    "text": "We had a debacle at this place, so I'll go start to finish.    We made our reservations 2 weeks ago for a party of 20 for a Birthday.  The day of, Management called to let us know someone needed to be there at 530PM for our 6PM reservation to check in,  We arrived at 530PM.  They advised us that the table wouldn't be ready until 6PM.  That was fine, we were just checking in.  6PM came and went and although there was plenty of room in the lounge, we weren't seated.  They wanted to seat us in the yard.  Unfortunately there was a crowd at our section that wouldn't leave.  Management and the server advised them numerous times they needed to move their party, but they didn't budge.  Then management even gave them free appetizers and their bills to get them moving.  About 630PM they moved us to a partial section next to these people.  There was only enough room for half our party and the other half had to stand while waiting for this group to move.  They were very drunk and had been there since 2PM.  I only know this because they made sure to tell us it was wrong of us to make them leave since they were there since 2PM.  They finally started moving out and a guy in their group came up to a women in our group holding a baby and started a fight.    Management provided us with free qpps for the inconvenience.  Not enough to feed 20 people.  But the food and our server were good.  The drinks and food are overpriced.  They do offer a brown bag special beer for $2.  It varies from Natural light to Old Style.  My aluminum bottle of Coors Light was $5.50.  The pretzel bites were really good.   They came with cheese fondue.  We also had fresh chips with onion dip.  That was really good too.  We ordered the Chicken meatballs and they were a great twist on chicken wings.  Lots of flavor and moist.  We also shared the beef dip.  It was really good too.  Again, over priced for what you get.   The idea of this place is there.  They have a fresh clam/oyster bar in one section.  They have the yard which has lots of outdoor seating with heaters and fire pits.  They also have corn hole, ping pong and shuffle board, and a fun photo booth.  There is a lounge area and the bar is between the lounge and yard.  There are too many young, young people working here.  They need more of a variety.  We would go back, but only for dinner and games.",

It's nice to park and walk into a restaurant without the annoying valet parking.  The killer:  NOISE.  The afternoon dining experience was awful.  Live music and everyone in the restaurant shouting in order to converse.  People in a restaurant want to speak to each other, but at this restaurant, don't bother.  The management explained that they like this idea--drown out conversation. We celebrated a friend's birthday there.  They have a nice menu with a wide selection of soups, salads, sandwiches, and main entrees.  Very interesting variety.  Lots of good craft beer choices.  If this place was quiet enough for us to carry out conversation, we might try it.  But the noise is too much.  We checked with some friends---same observation.  If you like the \"buzz\" of a loud restaurant and valet parking, this place is for you.  Sure not for us.",

I'm not a prude by any means, but they could take it a little easy on the makeup.  I wouldn't even have an issue with it if it were properly applied, but the it's too much for a daytime shift.  They look ridiculous outside where you can see all the mistakes.  Walked in and there were three women, from bad to worse with their make up jobs.  And, again, there is something to be said for appearance because these people represent you.  If these women are working on the day shift, they should wear more appropriate clothes.  Maybe something that fits them properly.  Nobody wants their food served with a side of ass.  There are kids here during the day, maybe think about it.  Women shouldn't have to look like a stripper clown to make some tips.",

Special kudos to Alexia and the entire staff for making this a memorable night.",

A lot of restaurants could take a lesson from this place. Good food, good atmosphere, GREAT service.",

We had a table on the patio right by the entrance and the weather, crowd watching and total experience was first rate!  Our waitress was exceptional and as we had some questions about the wine selection, the manager came to our table, explained the wine choices, let us have a taste and also provided us with an appetizer to pair with the wine.  Five stars isn't enough of a rating as our experience was awesome.  We usually eat here for lunch on the weekends but now we will come back more often for dinner as well",

    "text": "I had the opportunity to visit Culinary Dropout at The Yard earlier this year as part of a Yelp Elite event and I have been looking forward to coming back ever since. If you've never been to The Yard, then you need to check it out. Located in Central Phoenix close to Missouri and 7th Street, The Yard offers three distinct restaurants and a common patio area - a GREAT place to hang out with friends. On this recent visit, I took a small group of customers there for lunch. While I was leaning towards Barrio Urbano (SO amazing!) one of the guys in our group had just had Mexican food so we decided on Culinary Dropout. We were glad with the choice!  We started off with a few small bites: brussels sprouts, roasted beets, and truffle cheddar potato chips. The brussels sprouts were perfect roasted with a nice char on the outside. The beets were small cubes served with light balsamic finish. They  had a deep, earthy flavor that hit the spot. The chips were also very good, crisp and salty with shaved cheese on top (can't go wrong with that!) All in all, the snacks were very good - only $3 each but a little on the small side. I'm glad we got them all as starters.  For my lunch, I went with the seared tuna salad, a large bowl of greens served up with a light ginger vinaigrette, cashews and crunchy wasabi peas, topped with petite, delicate seared ahi medallions. The smooth taste of the tuna mixed with the fresh greens and dressing (with the occasional crunch) was wonderful and I was very satisfied.  The sandwiches also looked very good. One of my customers ordered the chicken club and it looked like a monster bacon cheeseburger with a grilled chicken breast in lieu of a beef patty. Cheese was oozing down all sides and it looked amazing. I might need to try that next time!  If you are in the Central Phoenix area and are looking for a cool place to hang out and enjoy some great gastro-pub fare, then look no further than Culinary Dropout at The Yard!  Enjoy!!",

When we first sat down, I asked about the happy hour specials and was told what they were but that we couldn't get them and would have to pay full price because we were seated inside. I told the hostess three times that I wanted outside as he was bringing us in, but I didn't want to make a fuss about it. We asked to be moved and the girl said that would not be possible, but what we could do is go to the bar. My friend and I went up to the bar to get our happy hour specials while our third friend who doesn't drink waited at the table. While we were getting out drinks three different people came up to my friend who was still at the table asking what the problem was and where we were and what we were doing. They were so rude to her she wanted to leave.  Pro-tip: if you offer different prices at different spots in your restaurant people will go for the cheapest.  The rest of the time the waitress was very rude to us and even ignored me several times when I asked for our check. I don't want to come back here if I can help it.",

There were a couple nice veg options, so I didn't feel like I was forced into any dish. Our table got a variety of dishes from salads to meatloaf. Everyone was happy with what they got. The decor and vibe is cool- Edison bulbs aplenty with that rustic yet elegant thing going on. Our server was super knowledgable and friendly.  There is a cool yard space with games too, so brunch can easily turn into an all day drinking event.  My only real complaint- don't force people into valet. After we got inside, I realized I left my sweater in the car, and it was such a pain to go and find it.",

It had a slaw + horse radish in it and was served with a pickle a side of salad (you could have chosen chips or french fries). They have different salad dressing toppings but I went with champagne vinaigrette which tasted nice and light. I tried the chicken and waffles with biscuit and mashed potato and thought the chicken was cooked perfectly. It wasn't overly salty or overly cooked. The meat was moist and tender. The pretzel bun on my sandwich was super unique but filling. They had a live band play tonight called Vinyl Station. They played awesome cover songs including some songs by Oasis, Beatles, Cold Play and Black Keys. Our waitress was friendly/cool and the manager comp'd us on the chicken because no 1 actually ordered the chicken. They left out our fish and chips order on accident but it didn't take long for them to whip it up. The tartar sauce was perfect and the fish was great. I'd come back here again with friends for sure. The space is super hip, well decorated and fun. Music can be loud so conversing can get difficult.",

The atmosphere here is great, the outdoor seating and activities out back were nice. Live music going on by local artists. And the food is amazing both times I stopped by. Very friendly staff, look forward to my next trip to Phoenix!",

I appreciated the complimentary valet and the super nice waitstaff. My waitress helped me pick out an Arizona IPA that I ended up loving. And she recommended the antipasti happy hour above all, which was a SMART move! I feel kind of hit or miss about antipasti plates, but this was fantastic. There was a nice (but smaller) portion meat and cheese, but the plate was filled with all sorts of other goodies that I loved! I was traveling solo and the plate was a great meal on its own. They never made me feel bad for taking up a table and I never had to wait for water! Overall, one of my favorite restaurant experiences while traveling.",

Since it is not their busiest time of day they are generous allowing us to spend a few hours \"grazing and sipping\" as we work through business plans. It's great to have the yard there for when we needed a break or to use game of corn hole as the tie breakers for the  decision of the direction of the company:-)  They have a good variety of mixed drinks and our waiter was good at proving suggestions. Our table found humor in the fact that their \"rotating tap\" was Miller highlife:-)  All of the appetizers we ordered were great: hummus, pretzels, and antipasto plate. I love the pretzels with cheese fondue. Lots of delicious warm pretzel balls and good cheese.  Parking can be tough at busier times. They offer complimentary valet (obviously need to tip)",

I stop in for lunch every now and then and even with the businesses close by coming in, the service is always faster than I would expect. Tonight was my first time stopping in to see how the night life was, and it's quite the scene! They have ping pong and corn hole toss out back, definitely a fun time after a few drinks. I was able to meet the manager, MK, to tell her how well of a restaurant she was running and she was extremely gracious of it, and does and excellent job running the show. Definitely check out the culinary drop out!",

After waiting at the hostess station which is outside and in the sun to be told the only thing available was in the bar only got worse from there. The hostess said any table in the bar was open. I clarified it was a table and not the bar and she said yes. We proceeded to sit down  only to be approached by the waitress asking who sat us. Explained the hostess did. She then came back and told us we couldn't sit there because there was a reservation and could we go back out to hostess and wait for a table. We said no we are leaving. If they can't even get a table right who knows what the food would have been like.",

The bartender was amazing... she helped my wife with her cocktail selection meanwhile I had to try a LoneStar beer from old Texas. Because we were meeting for lunch we grabbed some cheese and the Iberico ham which is sliced fresh. Having been to Spain this Iberico was right up there and a generous amount considering how expensive this ham is.  Once seated our drinks did take a little longer to arrive as the apps arrived prior. This could have been because they had a party going on and the bar could have been backed up a bit but all the drinks we got including the mule I got was really good.  We more or less picked at appetizers that were fresh and really good. My favorite had to be the sweet peppers and the assortment of cheeses and meats.  Would def recommend the location. The only negative is what I call \"forced valet\". I understand that it is \"complementary\" but you always feel obligated to tip. And believe me it isn't the money, it's if I believe you are like me you are more than capable of parking your own car.",

Like is there multiple restaurants in one? Just different seating areas? Seemed like a big hodge podge in an amazing way.   A few takeaways - drinks: first round is very light on the alcohol until you start asking for doubles and then they start pouring (just to make sure you're serious, I guess). The appetizers were phenomenal. I don't know what it is about Phoenix and their obsession and expertise in deviled eggs, but WOW so good. For my entree I ordered the pierogies and now that I'm thinking about them I want them right now. They were very creamy and hot.   The only downside to this was that our server didn't even notice that one of the members in our party didn't receive their entree. Literally for about 10 minutes and then we had to tell her about it. We eventually got it but it was also still included in the bill. Didn't seem very professional for us to ask to have it removed when one member of our party was sitting without a meal for 10 minutes for the server to not even notice.",

I was addicted to their fondue pretzels.  It was soft and chewy and the fondue provolone cheese that accompanied the pretzels were out of this world.  It added to the texture of the pretzel making it creamy and sticky too.  If I wasn't so stuffed from the pretzels,  I would have enjoyed my prime rib French dip sandwich more.  It was so good and it came with an au jus dipping sauce.  The place could get loud but it wasn't too loud where you couldn't have conversation.  A great place to catch a sporting event on tv as well.  The game area has shuffle board and corn hole.  You would have to sign up with the host and they will hold your I.D.  The game area even had a free photo booth.  Valet parking is offered.  Good for big parties and birthday events.",

There was a shift change, the bartender leaving asked us to close out, but didn't communicate with the new guy, so we ended up ignored for a while. Then we ordered nachos that came out cold. We asked for new ones, but instead we watched them just put the whole plate in the cheese melter oven, then bring it back out, so the guac and sour cream were baked and warm. Ew. Then the bartender lied and said that they didn't, even though it's an open kitchen and we literally watched it happen. I feel like if not for that, it would have been a decent experience.

Service was pretty good, servers were attentive enough.  What I had: Pretzel Fondue Pretzel balls can be a little more chewy and softer, but the molten cheese for dipping is quite fun.    Port Salut Semi-soft, creamy, and delicious with their baguette.  Jamon Iberico Acorn fed, free=-range, black hoof pig....so they say...It was delicious and thin, but were sliced with a machine!!  They weren't hand carved by an experienced jam on handler...but then again, this is Phoenix.  What do I expect?  Grilled Cheese Sliders These were \"slider\" sized or personal size grilled cheese that were not so mini.  Crispy outside, fluffy and cheesy inside.  From their happy hour menu.  Korean Shrimp & Chicken Stick I don't know what's \"Korean\" about this, but the marinade was spicy.  The veggies were also very spicy and good.  The chicken could've been more juicy, but the overall dish was pretty good.  Smoked Salmon Bruschetta My fav item.  With pickled pink onions, tomato, capers, and olive oil.  Tangy, smokey, crispy.  Addictive!  36-Hour Pork Ribs Full rack of baby back ribs that are slow cooked for 36 hours and basted with sweet and spicy jalapeno and molasses sauce.  Served with fries and yummy coleslaws!  The sauce was very tasty, but there were some spots on the rib that were too salty for some reason.  Then there were other parts that weren't salty.  Perhaps the chef literally threw a handful of salt on the ribs!?",

Second of all, be wary of the bathrooms because they're kind of confusing. All I'm saying is, you don't want to be buzzed and have to go to the bathroom because you'll most likely go in through the wrong door. And I feel like they did this on purpose for laughs. On to some actual food reviews though... my friend got the sweet corn ravioli, which unfortunately about 5 min after the waitress left, we were informed they didn't have any more left by the manager. It was fine, they gave her a cheddar mash ravioli, which she said was really good. They comped her meal for her. Two of my other friends got the club. It looked like a burger to me, so I was confused, but they said it was delicious! Another person on our table got the fish and chips. I have to tell you, I watched her pick up the first piece of chicken and it literally fell apart like butter! Finally, I got the fried chicken. Oh em gee. It was so good! It came with mashed potatoes, coleslaw, and a honey drizzled biscuit. It was like an upgraded version of a meal from kfc but it is exactly what I had been craving! All in all this place is good. Be aware since they are a scratch based restaurant, they may run out of what you are ordering. Also, the wait staff does tend to take a long time to come back and check on you so you may be there a while.",

    "text": "This place is the anchor restaurant for the Yard, another solid Sam Fox Restaurant.   Went there on a Thursday night and was packed with the young business crowd but still was seated within 5 minutes.  Ordered the Pretzel Fondue,  Famous Fried Chicken and Kurobuta Pork Ribs which were all amazing.  The Pretzel Fondue was fun and very good but did not want to eat too much since the entree was not out yet. The fondue would be good for up to 4 - 6 people. Gotta try this! The Famous Fried Chicken was well prepared and glazed with honey to torture you with finger licking goodness. Also the Kurobuta Pork Ribs were very tender and the sauce was very unique in a good way. Was very happy with our selections. Was too full to try any dessert.   2nd time at the Yard and learned to valet the car with limited parking in the area.  Last time going to Little Cleo's we parked in the neighborhood at night and did not see the no parking sign",

She was super accommodating to help us achieve the event we wanted by being able to customize the menu and drink options. We had a reserved area out by the bags boards with several large tables set up for us.  Two waitresses took care of the group but there were several other staff who were THE most attentive staff people I have ever experienced at a restaurant.  Filling waters, cleaning up a broken glass, clearing finished plates, and more - they really made us feel cared for!  We all really enjoyed our set menu for the evening which was two different appetizers, a choice of 4 (I think) entrees, and a few desserts.  Before and after eating, everyone had a blast playing bags and shuffle board, and just standing around mingling.  I don't know what The Yard is like for a regular pop-in dinner, but I do have to say that for an event like this we couldn't have asked for anything better.  Truly a memorable experience!  (and sadly it was SO fun I didn't even take pictures!) - Note: also posted this same review on The Yard's yelp page.",

Later that night when we did, we were not disappointed! I loved how big the bar was-made it easy to find a spot and get some drinks. The bartender was kind and professional and he refilled our drinks in a timely manner. My friend's boyfriend ordered a burger-which he loved. After a few drinks we ventured to The Yard portion of the establishment. I love how you can bring your drinks over to play bags, fooseball, ping pong...you name it. They had a photobooth which was utilized quite a few times. Overall, Culinary Dropout was a great time! I kept telling my friends that I wish Wisconsin had a similar restaurant. Check them out!",

The service was fine, but the food was less impressive. EXCEPTION: the pretzels with fondue! I'm not a pretzel fan by any means, but these are pillows of perfectly salted, fluffy goodness paired with warm cheese fondue! Incredible! I would come back for a beer and the pretzels!   I ordered the broccoli cheddar cannelloni  as my entree. I would definitely skip this dish. Kind of reminded me of broccoli cheese casserole stuffed into pasta. The server willingly exchanged my entree for the fried chicken. The fried chicken and mashed potatoes were pretty good. Several people at the table ordered this popular item. Another person ordered the black muscles as an entree, which were served in a delicious white sauce with bread. The muscles are a nice portion!   Overall, some things worked. Some didn't.",

My spouse and I split a burger and a chicken entree salad, and both were really good, although the salad was a little shy on the chicken.  I ordered an old fashioned (my favorite cocktail), and they did it right: No muddling or splash of seltzer water, just bourbon, bitters, an orange peel and a Luxardo cherry (not one of those highly processed neon cherries) on ice. But it was a little watered down. My guess is the bartender made our drinks and they sat too long with the ice melting before our server brought them to us.  Loved The Yard, with games like ping pong and Foosball. I played with my niece's and nephew's kids until an employee came up and told me that kids aren't allowed in The Yard after 6 p.m. Really? Not even with adult supervision? That kinda sucked. They had to go back to the table and watch other people play games they wanted to play.  I would come back for dinner but not with kids. It was too heartbreaking to tell them they couldn't play the games.",

The atmosphere at Culinary Dropout  is really trendy and cool, even our server had a cool name \"Slade\". We decided to eat outside in order to avoid a wait and to take advantage of one of the rare occasions when you can eat on the patio in Phoenix, Arizona, in August.  My friends and I were famished, so we opted to order some of the house-made potato chips and the pretzels with provolone fondue.  Both of these appetizers were excellent.  I couldnt get enough of the pretzels, and if I hadn't had an entree coming, I probably would have polished off the whole order by myself.  As an entree I ordered the chicken club sandwich which came with a chicken breast, ham and bacon.  It was quite good.  My lunch companions had the meatloaf, fried chciken, and mac & cheese burger and they were equally delicious.  The service was perfect-our server was friendly and there at the right time every time.

Seeing that there was a line for parking (which is valet by the way) we assumed this place was going to be crazy busy but luckily it wasn't.  We got seated right away in their patio and got our order taken within a few minutes.   Our server, Grace, was awesome. She kept coming to check if everything was alright, always had a smile, and made my sister and I feel welcomed.    I ordered the breakfast burrito, which by the way is amaaaaazing! It came with tasty potatoes and salsa on the side. My sister got a burger and she said that was pretty good.   Aside from our food, the patio apparently has some games we can play with but there were a few large parties that were in the area so we avoided it, but it looked pretty cool. Also, they have TVs with sport games going on, which I love!   Overall, this place gets two thumbs up from me.",

The food is divine comfort food and of course the pretzels & fondue are a must!! Delicious cocktails and a paperbag beer are a fantastic accompaniment to any dish. Staff is always friendly and accommodating. A must for all.",

    "text": "By pure accident, my husband and I wound up at The Yard last weekend. We were originally planning on eating somewhere else, but that restaurant went on a spontaneous vacation so we had to come up with another game plan. Honestly, it was no hardship since we've wanted to try The Yard since they opened but have been putting it off.  When we arrived, it was around 5pm on a Saturday. Since it was July 4th weekend, the place was packed but not too packed. There was still some valet parking available and some spots on the streets. (The first time I came here, they were so packed we had to park about 10 minutes away and then the wait was over 45 minutes. Needless to say, we didn't stay that time.) When you arrive, you have the choice between dining at Culinary Dropout or Lola's. For this trip, we decided on Culinary Dropout.   Happy Hour runs from 3-6pm M-F. Since it was a holiday weekend, they extended it to Saturday. During Happy Hour, they have some appetizer deals and $4 well drinks. We decided to order the olives and crusty bread with olive oil dipping sauce. The olives came in a large bowl - they were both delicious and a great deal. The crusty bread was good but I really enjoyed dipping it in my main dish.   For the main course, my husband ordered the meatloaf and I ordered the sweet potato cannelloni. The meatloaf was extremely tender and flavorful. It came with a side of mashed potatoes and gravy. My dish was tasty as well. If you don't know, cannelloni is similar to ravioli except longer rectangular pieces. (I was unaware until the server explained to me.) The cannelloni was stuffed with delicious sweet potato puree then topped with roasted mushrooms, shallots, sweet potato chunks, and fresh snap peas. There was a light parmesan sauce that everything was lightly coated with. (Good bread dipping sauce.)  Overall, the food was pretty good. The location is unique and has an interesting vibe. We didn't check out the actual games area, but the inside was nice with plenty of space for dining. I'm not sure if we will be back since it isn't really in our neighborhood, but it's definitely something to check out if in the area.",

Then, my brother brought me here to Culinary Dropout... where RIBEYE CAP is rightfully an entree all to its own.  The ribeye cap had an Asian flavor with slight oyster sauce - not overpowering though.  The veggies with it were excellent too!",

    "text": "Dining out can be very costly no matter what a person's financial situation is. A recent study from Expatistan shows what the cost of living is around the Phoenix area. It illustrates, on average to go out and enjoy some entertainment i.e. basic dinner out for two in a neighborhood pub is $42.00, and dinner for two at an Italian restaurant is $70.00 (Expatistan). Whether being out at the neighborhood grill or enjoying a dinner for two at Applebee's, paying for entertainment can be difficult and hard on the pocket book. However, every once in a while even on a tight budget it's good to take advantage of culinary style food with an outstanding atmosphere. It's not very often a place with excellent culinary food is available at a reasonable price. And when the opportunity to go out arises, it's recommended to try something a little different, something the taste buds will enjoy, a place where friends and family love, with a great overall environment. In conclusion, get all you favorite people together enjoy live music, great food, and an overall excellent dining experience throughout their multiple locations. From Phoenix, Tempe, Scottsdale, and Tucson the locations are not far away. Try some of the many local breweries they have or some of the specialty drinks they can make. However, if indulging in adult beverages isn't in the cards, have fun playing a selection of lawn games, relaxing next to the fire pit on couch, or even work on that favorite yoga pose. Either way, Culinary Dropout will not be a disappointment and will definitely not break the bank. Fox Restaurant Concepts did an amazing job creating an atmosphere for all to enjoy, which makes you feel at home, and has proven to be perfect dining concept for all ages.",

It's located in the Yard which is confusing when you haven't been there. Everyone is quick to point you in a direction that doesn't help.   2. It so crowded and loud and this last time the entire patio was closed for private party.  I wish the valet mentioned that when we waited in a long parking line with the idea to eat outside.  Both time we ended up leaving and going somewhere else.  I won't try it again it is sooo ANNOYING  They did reach out after this review and offer to have is back on them which I think is great.  I live in San Diego so not possible but still like that they responded",

If you're having second thoughts on food from the Microbrewery, you have Little Cleos (seafood) and Barrio (Mexican) all within a few feet from the entrance. The atmosphere is really cool!   My girlfriend and I chose to come here for a Friday night date night. We arrived around 8 and didn't have to wait for a table which was nice. We were sat inside, by the window. The noise level inside was extremely loud and my girlfriend and I had to sit next to one another so that we could hear one another. Even then, we struggled to hear each other. They had live music playing which was likely the reason for the noise difficulty. Vinyl Station was the band that performed. Incredible. Though it was loud overall, vinyl station set the mood. Peaceful, acoustic vibes. I had just mentioned the band to my girlfriend. Really cool to eat dinner and listen to some local jams.   We ordered the pretzels & Fondue as an appetizer. Always a win if you get these. The cheese is outstanding and the pretzels are soft, warm, and delicious. The bowl is huge so make sure you don't fill up on these before your dish comes out! The food came not long after ordering.  We were impressed. I ordered the Sweet Corn Ravioli and my lady ordered the Prime Rib sandwich. I really enjoyed my ravioli. Sweet. My girlfriend enjoyed her sandwich but she felt the sandwhich had to much mayo.  The mayo was good tasting there was just too much for her preference. Still enjoyed her meal as did I.   The service was exceptional. Our waiter was gracious, speedy, and thorough. He offered to box up our food but we graciously declined the offer as we were still slowly working on our plates. Our waiter knew what he was doing. Always made sure our needs were met. Great experience.   If you're looking for a little fun, different then your typical Applebee's, or Sizzler, this is your place. They have ping pong, corn-hole, massive Jenga, and a huge outdoor patio. They have a great local selection of beer and live music on the weekends. Well done Sam Fox, well done. .",

I was surprised to see the menu consisted of really generic, run of the mill food. Sandwiches, soups, and some diner favorites like meatloaf and fried chicken.    Started with the garlic hummus, which was pretty good, however, they give you about 2 cups of hummus to enjoy on 6 pita slices.  Had to ask for another round of pita bread since that got us through half of the hummus on the plate.  My husband ordered the pub burger and my daughter split an order of pierogi and grilled chicken club.    Pierogi were (at one time) considered peasant food in Poland due to their affordability...that said the order consisted of 3 of them atop some really overpowering fraiche. Overpowering and overpriced.    Husband enjoyed his burger and my daughter and I agreed that the chicken club was good....average but good.    Finished the meal with a Smores type dessert, which was very good but was soon too sweet to finish.    Perhaps these culinary dropouts should go back and finish culinary school to be able to create a meal that will truly pack a punch and leave a lasting impression on its customers.",

We had a blast playing ping ping, listening to their live band, and taking photos with their selfie photo station that we forgot that it was an hour wait. We finally sat down, ordered some amazing drinks, and had some delicious Pretzel bites with cheese and Perogies! (Fiance LOVED these). We had their famous Fried Chicken (The biscuit that comes with this is to die for) and the Pub Burger.  All in all, Amazing atmosphere and food.

Waitress lacked personality and messed up multiple orders at my table.  Wanted to play games and the equipment is all broken (ping pong paddles with torn and floppy rubber, bean bags with holes in them).  Only gets 2 stars due to the ambiance/atmosphere, cool manager or whoever he was getting the orders right and staying on top of our drinks, and the homemade ranch.  Won't be coming back.",

I would say that you do need to go here with a group of people if you're going to be able to enjoy the outdoor games (you could just go with one person on a date-- that'd be fun). They had cornhole, foosball, table tennis and a fun photo booth (where you can email pictures to yourself for free!)! They even had live music when we were there and the band was really good. We found ourselves staying longer than we originally intended just to listen to the live music.   I recommend the pretzel fondue-- that stuff is so good! My friend got a hamburger and split it with his wife and they were both stuffed by the end. It looked very delicious! The drinks are great too.   The servers were also very kind and attentive to all of our needs. I am glad that we ultimately decided to go to the Culinary Dropout. 5 stars all around. All in all, great servers, great food and a great place to make memories with those you care about.",

I cannot stop thinking about the turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll. Like now that I decided to write this, I will most likely have to go there now and get a turkey pastrami on a pretzel roll sandwich. The turkey pastrami itself is perfect .... but but then they add this amazing ZESTY coleslaw and instead of mere bread... or a bun... or even a roll... they put it between A PRETZEL ROLL.   I'd obviously give this place a five star review based alone on that sandwich (and their other delicacies & their service & such) but I hate the atmosphere in here. If you are sensitive to bad lighting & the high ceiling/bad acoustics/everyone having to raise their voices == migraine inducing stuff, it kinda sucks. You'd think, as I hoped, that sitting outside is better, but it really was only slightly less brain clangy. This goes double for if you have to be there enjoying the most delicious sandwich ever on a day when sportsball is on.",

The inside is really loud but the outside \"the yard\" is sooo cute!  Nice lounge-y couches all over, different games to play, and on the Fri night we were there, there was a live band playing.   Food was solid for a bar. Deviled eggs seasoned well (though the whites were rubbery), a lovely starter of strawberries and Brie (the strawberries were phenomenal!), pretzels with cheese fondue was nice...  For dinner we had the fried chicken which was ok but not great. The mashed potatoes and gravy was reminiscent of elementary school lunches (but in a good way!).   Overall a really fun spot.",

The food is made from scratch on site which is a definite plus.  It is a very fun atmosphere and the food is not only fresh but imaginative.  The servers are attentive.  Both trips the food was well prepared and there is a bar, pool tables, cornhole, and just simply a lot going on.  It was very popular with the college crowd for sure.  It can get a little noisy though so it probably wouldn't be a great place for a romantic dinner but certainly worth a trip for some fun group activities.",

First, the bathroom washing station at the hand/sink levels had a straight-line views right into the women's bathroom and vice versa. Hard to get past this one! The table we had was dark and hard to see your food for a reason. Meal one, the pork belly nachos-had a pool of grease when you got to the bottom of the plate. Two, the fried chicken plate tasted good but the chicken was completely burnt on the outside.  Three, the ravioli plate was under completely under cooked. Four, the burger does not come with tomato.  The only meal that was fine was the french dip sandwich.  We arrive at 8 PM and were so hungry that we didn't care to return any of the meals back to the kitchen.   Service was fine.  We just shared the food we had and left.",

I split the fried chicken and full rack of ribs with a friend and ate way to much! The ribs were ok, not incredibly tender and way to saucy. The fried chicken was juicy, crispy and soooo tasty! The chicken came with mashed potatoes and gravy with a honey butter biscuit, I could have eaten a dozen of those biscuits man!!!  The atmosphere lacked nothing to be desired at all!

Much to our disappointment they were far from good. Our burgers were burnt, not charred. I can honestly say that in and out tastes fresher and better. Not to mention our tiny patties were swimming in bun. The fries were over cooked, or cooked in old grease, not good. Asked for ranch, was greeted with chive sour cream. Finally, the service was awful. Our drinks were empty the whole time and we patiently waited for a check but our server never came. We had to ask someone else so we could escape this awful place.

Room service is a great one if you don't like the taste of alcohol and prefer juicy drinks.  Also, they do have a nice reservation policy for companies, so great for large parties.",

The place has a great vibe with a younger professional crowd at this time of day.  We sat at the bar had a nice cold beverage and started with their fondue with pretzels.  You get enough in to share with 8-10 people.   They were soft and fresh and cheese was very creamy blend of mild cheese.  For lunch we opted to share two dishes based I. Our servers Rex's- the French dip Wichita came with the best salty au jous you could ask for. We got the side salad cause we had so much for our spritzer. It was a modest sized salad with heirloom tomatoes and s house made ranch tossed perfectly to coat each leaf.  Then we got the house made ravioli with a corn filling- These were on the sweeter side like most creamed corn dishes.  Had a smiley undertone that I was not expecting but was very happy about to balance out the flavor.  Ithe pasta was perfectly made and very beautiful to look at.  A nice environment that seems like it can be a great place to hang out all day eat drink and have a great time with friends. Their outdoor area has games and there is free valet, no atm so bring a few bucks to dip the guys in the heat all day.   It's a large space but they do a great job at making you feel cozy despite the concrete floors.   Great job will be back again their menu had a little bit of good for most everyone, not sure if there were vegan choices.",

Our server was excellent but my problem was the food we got and our bill. Our bill was close to $80 for 2 of us and all we got was 2 $10 cocktails, the pretzels and some antipasto which was the smallest quantity I've ever seen. I was very disappointed and feel like we wasted our money. We would have been better off getting a meal or each an appetizer. We also had to deal with people constantly smoking near our table which could have triggered her asthma. I was more than bothered by the smoke. Needless to say, I wasn't impressed on many levels and won't be back :(",

After waiting about 10 minutes someone apologized for the wait (without us even mentioning anything about the wait) and took our order.  Less than five minutes later a manager came up to our table and profusely apologized for the wait and offered to comp several of our items. We ordered several appetizers for our dinner and they comped half of what we ordered! We never had to complain or say anything, but they were proactive about seeing a blip in service and made sure they didn't lose a customer.  That's what I call service! The food was on par with other similar restaurants with a large happy hour crowd...it wasn't the best, but wasn't the worst (thus the 4 stars).",

I've had a business dinner here and while the spot is definitely geared towards young professionals and a hangout spot it turned out to be a great location for our purposes. The restaurant overall is a modern-fun atmosphere, the restaurant is a large indoor space that opens up through roll-up doors (yes they're open) to a giant roofed outdoor space with lounge chairs for dining and an open space with lots of games (cornhole, etc) to choose from for entertainment and hang-out. Great vibes!  What surprised me was the food as everything we ordered was very tasty and the flavor was spot on! Not what we expected but a welcome surprise. The menu is a more classy/refined twist of a pub menu. From all items we ordered the wings are what stuck out - probably the best I've had anywhere so far! The nachos were mean and loaded with well made pork belly. My seared tuna salad came out great and as raw as tuna is supposed to be - well balanced.  I'll definitely be back here on my next trip to PHX and highly recommend this place as a spot for a casual hangout in a fun atmosphere and good food!",

There were a few things that were missed during drink orders and meal service, but quickly remedied by our waitress. The service was good, especially considering there were many large parties in addition to ours.  Our table split a few appetizers - I tried only the soft pretzels with cheese fondue. Fantastic!  My lunch was fried chicken which included 3 smallish pieces of chicken, mashed potatoes and gravy, cole slaw, and a biscuit. The coating on the chicken was hot and crispy with tender moist chicken inside. Yum. The potatoes were warmish but tasted great. I forgot to ask for no gravy, but it was okay (I'm not a fan of gravy). The cole slaw and buscuit were good too. The servings are generous - I ate about half of my meal.  Nice place for lunch for a group.",

Still having a hankering for seafood I leaned toward the fish and chips.   I ordered a local amber and kicked back.   Unfortunately, there was an issue with my order.    Timeliness apparently wasn't a factor.   One amber led to another.   Eventually the bartender realized it hadn't arrived and he lit a fire under the folks in the kitchen.   He was apologetic and took care of me.   When it did arrive the fish was lightly breaded, perfectly salted and delicious.  The chips were also nicely done and obviously recently cut.   All in all the meal turned out welll.    Props to these guys for their ability to roll with the punches and still keep all their customers happy.",

I have tried a few things on the menu but by far the best thing I've tried has been the pretzel bites with the white cheddar fondue! I can put that fondue on anything and eat it. If you come on happy hour, the price of this dish is discounted and is still a huge portion. Happy hour is the time to go to this spot. Good drink specials and food is pretty good too.

And the drink menu is as extensive as the food. It's quite impressive. Also they do have a kids menu just ask. Our water was never empty and she made sure I liked the drink I ordered and offered an alternative in case I didn't. The noise level is loud. We were outside at a high top and it was still loud. We also then played baggo (cornhole) after dinner and had more drinks which was fun. There are heaters all around and they'll turn them on/off at your request. So don't let cool temps deter you. They also had fans with a mister system for warmer months. Would definitely return.",

Then our food started to arrive. But only 2 dishes out of the 4 ordered. Our friends urged us to eat, thinking their food would be out soon. When we were halfway through our food, someone brought out 2 dishes but one of them was wrong. By the time all 3 of us had finished our meals, my friends meal still hadn't arrived. During that time my husband pointed to my lemonade and asked if he could get one as well. Our server brought my husband the cocktail my friend sitting next to me had. When my husband said \"honest mistake, I should've just said lemonade,\" our server said he would go grab the lemonade and come back. He never did. He didn't take the cocktail he left on the table off the menu, or my friends dish that came after the rest of us had eaten. We asked for a to go box we never that we received. The worst part was this guy was training a new server! Hopefully she doesn't pick up his weird ways.",

There is outdoor seating, TVs, and games, like ping pong tables and bean bag toss.    We ordered Thai Chile wings as an appetizer and I ordered the Gorgonzola chicken salad. I really liked the wings, it was flavorful and the sauce had a kick to it. The salad was good as well, the only complaint I had was that there was too much dressing in it, and I usually like salad with lots of dressing, but this was like drenched in dressing. Service was ok. I would come back here next time I'm in Phoenix.  Parking here is valet only because there is 3 restaurants plus the yard under 1 roof, and their parking lot is kind of small. Our car was like literally 15 feet from the valet stand. But I guess since the parking lot is small, they would rather have valet service versus people double parking or parking illegal.",

Our server (I can't remember his name but he is from Spokane) was so friendly, professional and attentive. The manager Jorge just happened to be walking by as I was trying to give someone directions over the phone and he has got to be one the nicest guys we met on the trip. Customer service at this place was top notch! They not only talked to us about the menu, but engaged us in other conversation...nothing deep, but they made us feel like welcomed guests and not just \"party of 2 at table 19\". Our server and Jorge gave us great recommendations and I ended up with the fried chicken which was well flavored and just the right amount of crispy and very juicy and tender. My friend had a the ribs and the were falling off the bone. Both were SO good! We also started out with the homemade chips and Onion dip and anti-pasta. Also very good. The environment was so welcoming and exciting. So much going on, yet not too crazy where you feel like you can't be in your moment. So glad we stopped here because not only was the food yummy but the service was AMAZING!",

This place is well below the many other options in north central Phoenix. They appear to have tried a party place as an infill but it has flopped badly.  For a good time try Postinos, Windsor or Federal Pizza.  WAY more classy than this central phoenix wanna-be party joint.",

    "text": "Alright, so I've been in to Culinary Dropout twice (at this location) and the first one was pretty good worthy of 4 starts. I came in the other day with my buddy and we sat at the bar and had good service, our questions were asked, nothing took too long to come out and we had people checking on us frequently to make sure we were alright. That was fine. The food is where we had trouble. Started off with the pretzels (my favorite appetizer there) and while the provolone was melted perfectly and the temperature was fine, I only found one pretzel that wasn't kinda stale and didn't taste super great. It seemed as if they had been cooked like a ballpark pretzel, which I was not a fan of. For entrees we had the Korean style ribeye cap and the Bistro steak, and I will never order either of those again and would not recommend them. The Korean style ribeye was ok, rather tasteless and had very little actual steak to the dish. Was not satisfactory as a meal. The Bistro steak was recommended to me and I was hungry and didn't finish it because I could not get past the overwhelming charred flavor. My steak was charred so much that it over powered everything about the steak and the rest of the dish and was completely unpleasant to taste. The rest of the dish was average if that, with the exception of the mushrooms that were cooked nearly perfectly, so cudos to the chef on saute that night. Because of my good experience in the past I am giving a rather favorable review. However, if just based on this experience there was nothing to bring me back except the drinks and kindness of the bartender.",

    "text": "I've always had a love/hate relationship with the old culinary dropout on camelback. Totally a style over substance place from the wait staff to the food, unfortunately this location is no different.   The boyfriend and I decided to see what all the hype was about with the opening of the Yard and grabbed dinner last Saturday night. The place was PACKED and the space is huge so you can imagine that it was a massive amount of people. However, it looked like most people were on the patio/outback either socializing or playing corn hole; the actual restaurant space itself didn't seem crazy packed. We gave our name to the hostess, who informed us it would be a 45 minute wait and took my phone number to text us when our table was ready. So fancy.    I must say the actual yard complex is a very cool spot, will def need to come back in some casual clothes to just hang out. although, with a few more dining spots slated to open soon I wonder how long before the courtyard turns into a cluster of people waiting for their tables mixed in with people just drinking and taking up space.  We tried our best to grab a spot at very full bar and got lucky to catch a spot that had just opened up. I got the after school special (my fav from arrogant butcher) and the boyfriend got an old fashioned. Props to the bartender for making some good cocktails.   We were called to our table in way less than 45 minutes and the hostess led us to a four top which was missing two of the chairs. I found this extremely unprofessional and messy looking and asked the hostess if we could sit at an adjacent table and was told that it was reserved. Whatever, I wasn't going to make a big deal out of it but no one ended up sitting there for the entire time we had dinner. I ordered the bistro steak and the boyfriend ordered the shrimp salad and we also started with the pretzels and fondue. Our waiter seemed super out of it/overwhelmed when he was taking our order and it was definitely a foreshadowing of things to come. My steak and French fries both came out cold and dry, which I found very strange since the other item on our order was a salad which shouldn't have required any wait time for prep. Some rando dropped off our food so I had to wait about five minutes to track down our waiter to tell him my food was cold and I needed more drank! He was rather nice about everything and someone I am assuming is his manager later came by and told me they were getting me a new steak. We had to wait awhile for the new steak and the waiter guy never brought me my next cocktail so I sat there with a dry throat picking at the boyfriend's salad. My steak arrived before my drink, clearly because the waiter had forgotten to put the order in and was only visiting our table every 45 minutes. When he finally showed back-up, the boyfriend let him know I still didn't have my drink. Eventually he brought me a new drink, but without a straw... such a tease. I get that the restaurant is new and they are still working out the kinks but with another location and a vast amount of wait staff to source from other restaurants, I would expect that Sam Fox would assemble a more professional experienced team to open this new restaurant. Our waiter looked like it was his first day every serving. Our bill eventually came and I was surprised that no one thought to compensate us for the disruption caused by the poor kitchen execution,,, a free round or dessert or something to wash the bad taste out.   Honestly, I'll probably return to Culinary Dropout just for the atmosphere but I will definitely be sticking to drink and apps for awhile until I forget how bad their service sucks again.",

    "text": "Stopped by Saturday for one drink before Little Cleo's opened at 4pm.  A group of seven, three of us started at the outside bar and when another couple came one of our group asked at the hostess station if we could to a high table right behind us. She said that would be fine.  We understand how this works and we wouldn't have just moved what checking.  Another one of the party went to ask for drinks at the bar, and he couldn't have been more rude when he told her 'you can't order here'. We had to wait for our server.  So no drinks and when a server (ours?  We'll never know) finally stopped by the table she said \"you know you can't just sit here. You need to be seated\".  We said yes, we understood and told her we had checked with the hostess.  She walked away. Still no drinks so one person goes to to bar to ask for drinks again, telling the bartender we have no server, and the first guy went back up and told the group of hostesses that a server yelled at us for sitting at that table.  We were confused since we tried to do everything correct and we had suggested this spot to our friends.  A nice ending though because a great guy came over, maybe a floor manager, and said three of the drinks we ordered where on him for the trouble.  I'm still baffled as to why two separate people were so rude.  It was busy but no more than any other Saturday.  My friends won't be back and we'll avoid the server that acted so put out that we were there. BTW Little Cleo's was fabulous!  Sam couldn't have been nicer and had no trouble getting us drinks and food!",

Atmosphere & ambience is very cool...outdoor ping pong tables, shuffleboard, fire pits outside or sit inside and you still get the same flavor.  Great waiter, helpful, attentive.  But most of all, GREAT menu.  We started with their antipasto board with an array of choices...meats, cheeses, hardboiled eggs, roasted aspargus, beets.  What a great way to start.  The bistro steak on a bed of melted gorgonzola was mouth-watering.  And hot carmel monkey bread with apple filling and vanilla bean ice cream, on the house, to end the birthday celebration.

It took us over an hour to get our food. Hey, that stuff happens, but when it does do something for the customer.  Me and my buddy make our living in the food service industry so we are pretty easy going about stuff especially when it was one of those things.  Just because we didn't kick up a storm doesn't mean you should save the free round of drink for the ones who do.

The place holds itself out as a bar, but the game area is constantly overrun with children whose parents use the game as a substitute for watching their children.  The first time I went for brunch, the place was packed, but my friend and I were able to snag a seat at the bar. It took forever for the bartender to acknowledge us and get our drink order, and even longer to place a food order. The breakfast burrito I had was really good, especially the potatoes that came with it. My friend opted for the basic eggs, bacon, and toast breakfast. When her food came, she asked if they had any jam for the toast. The waiter said she wasn't sure and would check. How can you serve toast and not have jelly? Makes no sense. Fortunately, they did have some freshly made strawberry preserves that were really delicious.   Drink prices are also pretty steep. $6.50 for a 16 oz for an Oskar Blues Pale Ale? I can go to Windsor and have a pitcher to myself for $7, and $5 if it's happy hour.  Had an early brunch a few weeks later and had no problem getting a table outside. I opted for the breakfast burrito again, but it wasn't as good this time. My boyfriend had the Captain Crunch Crusted French Toast, which sounded really good, but it was actually pretty bland. Our server was also just okay, which was disappointing because we were one of the only tables there.  My best experience was on a Thursday night. We got a great spot at one of the couches on the patio, and for the first time, I had great service here! Our waitress was awesome and never let our drinks get empty. She even put up with our drunken (annoying) party with a smile. And the Sweet Corn Cannelloni dish we ordered was excellent!  I came again yesterday for a late lunch. There was no problem getting a table, even though it was Memorial Day. Despite the fact that it wasn't that crowded, our waiter was pretty MIA. All of our drinks went empty at one point, and I would have definitely ordered another beer if he had bothered to ask. Thankfully, the food was excellent! We shared an order of grilled cheese sliders, and then I had the fried chicken because calories don't count on a 3-day weekend. My entree was amazing, and the portion was huge! I had a solid amount of food to take home for lunch today. My boyfriend said his double cheeseburger was great, evidenced by the fact that he didn't offer me a bite.  Although I enjoy gambling, I don't like to do it with my restaurant experiences. Until Culinary Dropout can become more of a sure bet, it won't be my first choice for dining in the area.   P.S.:  The bathrooms are setup unisex style, so don't be alarmed if you enter the bathroom and find the opposite sex in there.",

The staff was quick to deliver our drinks, but four salads, a burger, a meatloaf and 50 minutes later meant my lunch hour turned into a lunch two hour. I didn't exactly expect a ten minute turn around on our food; but really, almost an hour to deliver these dishes is seriously extreme. Even though my boss was with me, by the end of our lunch I was itching to get back to the office as to not waste any more time.  The burger I ordered was on the menu at $12, not exactly cheap to begin with. The waitress asked if I would like fries or a salad with it, but I asked if there was a vegetable I could have instead and she was happy to bring it out with asparagus. Regrettably, she failed to mention an added charge to make that swap from spuds to veg. My $12 burger, now $18 after fees, tax, and tip, is why I usually skip lunches during the week and bring in my own from home. :-(  I did; however, like the food itself, the company, the location, and the waitress was nice enough as well as apologetic about the long wait. I like the LARGE outdoor patio complete with shuffle board, corn hole, ping pong, and foosball. Seems like it could be a fun place to come for drinks in the evening hours with a couple of work buddies.  On my previous visit, I had the meatloaf, the meatloaf itself was good - and I did really enjoy the green beans, but not awesome and not really worth the price IMO, especially when adorn with what can only be described as fancy ketchup, really, ketchup on a $16 meatloaf (after tax-tip). Honestly, I feel the food on the menu is priced about 20% too high for most of the items. I wouldn't mind returning for happy hour, but outside of that, I'll likely just stick to \"grabbing a drink\" or two with friends if I'm ever back.",

Yeah, that happy!  A small group of us went here for brunch/lunch on Saturday. Having been to the Scottsdale location before, I had an idea of what was on the menu. However, what puts this Culinary Dropout stand out is an awesome patio. We started with the crusty bread and olive oil (with a balsamic vinegar syrup) and the 12-hour roasted tomatoes. Both we excellent, and super inexpensive. We also had their bacon bloody mary (of course) which was divine (of course). My meal was the biscuits and gravy with two sunny-side-up eggs and home fries. The gravy was so good, I could have sucked it up through a straw. So good! We all agreed this would be a perfect spot for a first date. If any of us were actually going out on dates.  We're planning on riding our bikes back here soon. As an added bonus, an oyster bar is slated to open in the complex within the next month. We peaked in the windows, and it looks like another great spot for a first date (with the added benefit of eating oysters, so I might have a chance to get some!!)",

    "text": "Yes, I'm a Dropout. I stopped in yesterday to visit with David Fox and see the new place. I have been looking forward for this venue to open for several months now. Right off the bat Props to Noel and Luke my servers. Two awesome young ones.   So think of The Dropout and The Yard as a backyard, front porch and kitchen all rolled into one. This is Fox Restaurant Concepts' biggest project yet. It transformed an old motorcycle shop near 7th Street and Bethany Home into the most distinct restaurant. The property is just beautiful. A very large patio, or small park with various seating vignettes, including picnic tables and adirondack chairs. Lawn games for those devoted to ping pong, bocce ball and Pig in a Hole, all under a metal canopy.  Inside and outside there will be the two live music venues . If you have seen people like \"Blues Man Mike\" these shows are excellent. The little stage in the house is set in a wooden niche that provides an acoustic sound board. There are car bay doors for a great open air atmosphere.  The interior design has a western chic but modern ambiance and beautifully restored architecture. The bar is made of oak unstained but finished, a beautiful piece. The huge historic  Indian Motorcycle mural has been renovated and is a stunning piece of art. The kitchen is open and in view.  The beer on tap will range from $6 to $12. I'm looking forward to bellying up to the bar during an evening date to have a brew and laugh with my friends. Today I was allowed to try two drinks and they were superb. A crisp malt stella artois belgium brew and the second a mix called \"The After School\" Think Boilermaker. This drink was superb.  I was very fortunate to have the kitchen make a little dinner for me while I was speaking to Jason the very cool as hell manager. They cooked me up a pound of  French steamed mussels with garlic, white wine, butter and little bites of sausage to spice up the broth. Came with toast. So Good.  And thank you for the culinary dropout, beer can sleeve, stealthy yet stylish.  Grand Opening is Monday 2/11/13",

The food is absolutely phenomenal and there is a full bar inside or outside. The pretzels and cheese fondue is a must anytime you visit and is super cheap on happy hour too! All the entrees are delicious, but even my grandma can't stop raving about the battered fish she got. For dessert, I'd go with the monkey bread which is enough to share with the table. The had to deduct a star because the wait is soooo long a majprity of the time, they don't accept reservations, and it's mandatory valet :(",

    "text": "From the street when you're driving by at night, this place looks like the spot to be! It is so eye catching and the location is huge! After we parked and approached the building, I noticed three different names. I couldn't figure out if there were separate establishments and menus but we allowed ourselves to be seated by the first peppy man to approach us.   We were seated right away with Culinary Dropout menus. Not much later and we had our blonde waitress asking if we had any questions. The menu was....rather boring, unexpected, and...lame. I don't know how to put it other than those three words because it honestly just didn't feel like enough options or descriptions. It could just be me...  Anyways, we couldn't settle on meals so we ordered drinks and appetizers instead. We went with the pretzel balls and cheese dip and buffalo chicken meatballs.   The pretzels were fine and the cheese was just OK. The cheese was rather processed tasting and the meatballs SUCKED. I guess it was our bad for ordering chicken meatballs but ew...the outside of the meatball was overcooked and the inside was just a tablespoon of spices. Waaaay to much spice!   We can't complain with our drinks. How can you mess up a double vodka with a splash of cranberry? You can't. And the Angry Orchard with Licor 43 and lemon sour was very tasty. If you like vanilla and apples then this is the drink for you!   Lastly, the service was garbage. Our waitress was inattentive and during more than half our visit, she was seen in the corner eating and when she was seen serving, she was still chewing and swallowing her food. Gross.",

The food is always spot on; very fresh, made in house, and their main entrees are definitely my favorite part of the menu. Whether I sit at the bar with or sit at a table I always receive great service, both in and outside of peak rush hours. Their happy hour has great specials both for drinks and food but their regular menu has great pricing as well for the quality and quantity that you receive.   I have made friends with several servers and bartenders while visiting: William, Jeffrey, Wyatt, and Chase are the best in business and I won't sit anywhere else except in their sections or at the bar while they are working. They always go above and beyond to take care of me as a regular and I enjoy watching them interact and entertain heir first time customers as well.  This is one of my favorite restaurants to hang out at and I hope everyone gets to experience the same wonderful atmosphere and customer service that I do!",

We also had the 36-hour pork ribs and the fried chicken, both were pretty good. Those two plates had pretty large portions so if your not a big eater I would share it with someone.

    "text": "Sooooooo(oooooo...) delicious!  I came with a pal and his 3-year old daughter. Clearly, this isn't a super child-friendly place, but everyone - our waitress, the other waiters and waitresses, the hostesses, and the kitchen staff - did everything within their power to accommodate the wee one...including making a chocolate milk from scratch.  Ridiculous, and it got applause from the kiddo!  Being at the pre-opening, we had the opportunity to try a lot of different things...like a gross amount of food.  I'm not exactly proud of how much I ate.  We started with the crusty bread and oil, prosciutto (a HUGE pile), another pork meat I can't recall, manchego and prairie breeze cheeses.  While eating them, I wondered why our server didn't tell us which meat was which...and then we noticed they are actually written on the plate paper liner.  Duh....  I had the \"healthy\" salmon entree, which was cooked to perfection and the farro, cooked apple and fennel side flavorful enough that I wouldn't immediate think it was super healthy.   My buddy wanted the Korean Ribeye Cap but it was not available (noted on the menu that it has extremely limited availability), so he got the pork ribs instead.  It was a TON of food again, with a side of cole slaw that I ate.  For kids, we were given the option of grilled cheese sliders, burger sliders, mac n cheese, and chicken tenders, so slightly more options than I'd expect for a not-so-kid-friendly type of place.  My pal had the Bacon Bloody Mary and guzzled 2 of those.  I had only 1 cocktail - the Maria Pepino, which is basically a bloody mary with tequila instead of vodka, and garnished with a pickled pepper.  It was the perfect blend of savory tomato, spice, and acid.  The only \"misses\" for me was the iced tea (no one has plain iced tea anymore...no biggie, but please freaking tell me it's some nasty sweet shit) and the monkey bread, which was overly sweet and had a ton of apples that we picked around.  Our bill was an astronomical $110+ for lunch...which included 3 cocktails, a few appetizers, 3 entrees, and a dessert.  Would I be back for the whole she-bang?  Hell no...unless it's another gratis meal.  But will I be back for the sweet patio and a great cocktail and apps?  Most definitely!  FYI, the large patio space is deceiving...it is actually shared with the coffee shop and oyster bar (not yet open as far as I know), so I cannot imagine there will ever be a time without a large wait for group patio seating.  Lots of parking in the back.  Clean restrooms, but odd how they're set up... They are outside of the main restaurant portion, with separate doors for Men and Women.  But both doors take you to the communal sinks.  Why not just have one door to the restrooms?    Our meal benefited Make A Wish Arizona - the founding Make A Wish chapter, if you didn't know!",

Many a Sunday, I have made the long trek to the Culinary in Scottsdale and now I have my very own right up the street! The service here is always great and I love to watch the food preparation with the open layout providing a great kitchen view. Since I am not a meat eater, I tend to order the sweet corn cannelloni for dinner or the tuna sliders for lunch. However, regardless of the time of day, I am always able to eat my fair share of the pretzels and fondue....If it was socially acceptable I would drink this provolone cheese sauce.   If it is time to get your happy hour on, try the Singapore sling and drink it on the open concept patio. They make the best I have ever had. The patio is huge and has enough games to keep you occupied while sipping on one of their many fabulous concoctions.",

I then had the kale and corn salad with shrimp and it was amazing.  The dressing was tangy, the shrimps were smoky and filling, and the lemon zing made it all harmonize for a good half hour of bliss.  All this paired with a Sauvignon Blanc that was perfectly dry yet pineapple-fruity on the nose sent me to s happy place despite the hellish heat just outside.  I will be back soon to try the games next door and other delights.",

    "text": "I am so disappointed that I actually set up a yelp account for the purpose of reviewing this place. I've been here a couple of times. The first time, it was so loud that I couldn't hear my dinner mates. Moreover, I ordered a salad with chicken and the chicken came out pink. Not sort-of pink. Really-not-yet-cooked-pink.   Figuring I'd give it another try, I ordered the salmon dish on a different occasion and it was actually really good. Pleasant surprise. This was from the Scottsdale location, which was also so loud you couldn't hear each other despite sitting next to one another.   Today, wanting some good protein and veggies, my girlfriend and I ordered takeout from the culinary dropout at the yard. Each salmon entree was $22.00. And the container held a piece of salmon, approximately eight thimble-sized parsnip pieces, four tracing-paper-thin apple slices and four Brussels sprouts halves. For $22.00. And I'm the first person to spend money of good food, so am used to large restaurant bills. This, however, in presentation and substance, was pathetic. We actually called the manager to let the restaurant know about the poor take out orders, and he was apathetic, at best. I will not be back to this restaurant, especially given all of the quality food  available in the valley.",

    "text": "First off, this is a very cool place.  They have huge, covered outside area with ping-pong tables, gas fire pits, sofas and, of course, heaters.  The managers did a great job hiring and training the staff.  Everybody is so friendly. Even staff who are not serving you will make eye contact and smile.  That is pretty rare.  I think they actually are having fun working there!  They make it such a fun place you can go there by yourself and have a good time.   Despite being a new place they really know   their menu and give great suggestions.  I  didn't listen to the bartender's advice about a beer and she was right, I didn't care for it.  Another bartender noticed I wasn't drinking it so he replaced it with their excellent Prohibition lager.  The trout is excellent.  So were the mussels.  The seared tuna salad is pretty good.  Our server said they are known for their fried chicken so the next time I ate there that's what I had.  I was impressed with how much chicken you get.  Huge pieces! Funny thing thought was they only gave you 2 tablespoons of slaw and a quarter cup of mashed potatoes.  Better than skimping on the entree!  The taters were tasty but a little on the runny side.  The biscuit was not that light and fluffy but did taste pretty good.  Interesting that the chicken has honey on it but none for the biscuit.  I probably could have asked for it though.  Only one complaint, which I mentioned in a tip.  I do not like valet parking and that's all they have. The parking lot is right behind the place!  Why would someone want to valet and then have to wait 3 times longer to get your car that just to walk a few feet over to it!  I must not be alone here because I used to park in a little shopping area next door, but they recently put up a sign, \"No restaurant parking\"  so I had to park a couple of blocks away in the residential streets behind the restaurant, which was also pretty crowed.  I wouldn't be surprised to soon see a sign not to park there either.  Come on guys, this is not the type of restaurant that should have valet!  You have a very nice, down to earth, friendly place, not some snobby place!",

Do not waste your money on the fried chicken or the pretzel/cheese fondue... (overpriced and for the ones that now how to cook, me, we can make this way better). Live music on Fridays and Saturdays!! =) Oh! and it is the ONLY place in Arizona where I can find Pisco Sours! If you are South Americans, you know what I am talking about.

My biggest gripe however is when I went there, it was taking forever and a day just to get get my car into the parking lot. They were having valet parking. I ended up just driving thru the neighborhood and parking on residential street. Literally took me 15 minutes to drive my car 100 yards due to this stupid valet parking. Just end the valet parking and let people park their dam cars in the lot and get on with their nites! How frustrating that was!!!",

I like it. Anyway, it won't be a frequent stop, but it's part of the rotation. :-)",

As someone who works in the service industry I understand the stresses that come with large parties, but he handled it very well. Our table shared the roasted Brussels sprouts, prosciutto deviled eggs (worth killing over), soft pretzels & provolone fondue (wish pretzels were a little more salted), ma...the meatloaf?!, shrimp & pork belly ramen (can't you tell I love pork belly?), prime rib dip, and some other stuff I can't remember the name of. Overall, loved the cool fusion of foods going on and how well they maintained an abundance of flavors in all their dishes. Especially thought it was cool my ramen came with chopsticks, that's how you know this place is legit! And one last shout out to our cool ass server",

    "text": "For decor alone, Culinary Dropout gets 5 stars. Lots of natural elements with sparkly chandeliers and a huge patio space with all of the aforementioned games. I really love that they paid homage to the auto-body or motorcycle shop that it was formerly on the sign out on the street. The open concept is fabulous.  Me and a girlfriend of mine came here for lunch last week and got there early as I've heard from friends who work there and other people who have visited that there can be quite a wait both at lunch and at dinner which I totally understand as it's a new spot in a great location. I'm glad we did as there was little to no people there so we were able to get a seat quickly.   We started out with the pretzel and provolone fondue...YUMMY! I totally indulged my inner fatty but we split it so I didn't feel quite as guilty.  I ordered one of my favorite drinks to try at different places just to see how each place mixes it up (literally), the Moscow Mule. It was pretty good...not the best I've had but it was good. After pigging out on pretzels, we both ordered the Spring Salad which we were told had just been added to the menu and that was the first time they were being debuted; It consisted mainly of asparagus, beets, green beans, greens and a vinaigrette. The salad was tasty and light..perfect for the warm weather.   While we should have stopped there, we decided to get the salted caramel corn that came in a glass with caramel pudding I believe on the bottom layer. So good! My sweet tooth was satisfied.  I will say, it's a pretty pricey lunch at $75 but I'm definitely gonna come back on a Sunday Funday biking kind of day to check out the bar and the patio.",

This location is awesome. Specially with the weather we had today.  Another positive point is the service. Friendly and professional.  The food is my main complaint, which is pretty serious if the review is about a restaurant.  We had the chips with the onion dip. This should be ordered by at least 4 people, they're good but super grease and the serving is way too much for 2 people (given the quantity of oil).  I had the tuna salad which was absolutely uneventful.  The kids burger was OK.  At least it wasn't extremely overpriced, otherwise I would take off another star.   The location worth the visit, specially with great weather, but would't go for the food (at least what I tried).  BTW, the Arnold Palmer was pretty good.  Cheers",

They were so soft and the provolone fondue was creamy and serious perfection! My friend and I accidentally filled up on these and hardly ate any of our entree.  Whoops...but we didn't care, it was sooooo worth it!  And as for the Bacon Bloody Mary I had...well, THAT was something to remember!  I will be coming back just fo the pretzels and the bloody mary.  I'll probably be judged by everyone sitting around me as I scarf the pretzels and wash it down with the BM.  But who cares?!  That being said, I didn't love my entree as much.  I got the shaved prime rib dip.  While the prime rib was cooked and shaved just right, it wasn't something that jumped out at my tastebuds.  My friend had the Italian Grinder and didn't' feel partial to it either.  Neither one of our sandwiches were gross, but they just weren't what we were hoping for.    Loved the bathrooms here!  They are communal and tripped me out for a slit second.  But it was even funnier to watch a man come in as I was getting ready to walk out.  He turned around faster than he could zip his fly up.  He was so embarrassed and thought he had walked in to the women's side.  Hee hee.    I love the atmosphere Culinary Dropout has put together here.  It has this awesome yard vibe but with a modern and stylish fun.  Not sure I'd go here again for an entree.  But I'd love to come back for the pretzels, BM, and to sit outside and take more of the restaurant in.",

The outside portion of the restaurant is always fun and has ping pong tables, corn hole, and a free photo booth that emails the pics to you.

There were five of us and we tried five different menu items but the stand out items were definitely the bread with balsamic vinegar and oil as well as the bbq pork nachos. The wait did take a little while but the waitress kindly let us know that the wait we were experience was not typical. Overall, very good experience. Definitely would go again to try different items if I was in the area.",

My pet peeve was despite it being daytime and pretty slow there was a line of 8 cars to valet park which took 30 minutes. The valet parking also seems completely unnecessary, just let me park and go inside.  Other than that this is a great location at The Yard with awesome game area that has cornhole, ping pong and a really cool outdoor area to hang around in. Prices are not too bad and great food and drink here. This is a great place to hang out with a large group of friends and do a little bar crawl as there are several fun spots in the area.",

My friends did the $1.95 brown bag surprise which is a beer in a brown bag and u don't know what type of beer it is. They also did the 2 for 1 brown bag special which is the surprise beer with a surprise shot bottle, really fun idea.The food was good not great but not bad either. I would come back because of the fun energy and would get the snack boards with cheese and meat, and the perogies were so yummy with the cauliflower.",

    "text": "I feel like this is a place where I could hang out with my bros, i.e., if I knew any bros in Phoenix. You know what I mean by bros? Those are the dudes you chill with as you down pints and swap stories about the ladies, man. But I was recently in Phoenix for a business trip, and this cavernous place was the chosen location for our pre-offsite team dinner where we were supposed to bond and talk shop. So no bro talk...and someone would have had to teach me how to talk like a bro anyway. Old dog, untrainable. The proprietors appear to be attracting party-hardy types, the kind who leave big tips without calculating the percentages, as well as big families with kids who like to run around among strangers.  This was a huge space at 53,000 square feet, a lot of it taken up by covered patio seating, ping-pong tables, foosball tables, and corn-hole tosses. Fun for the kiddies but pretty much taken over by the bros. I met my colleagues at the mammoth bar where they had beer on tap for days (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2nF78og&s=4986752e09a404466c51b468eac67f5e1f65dbcd964424fe9936d39a7881d5fe\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2nF78og</a>). It was Happy Hour, so I took advantage and ordered a $4 Sangria which was refreshing no matter how you slice the lime (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2FOPncB&s=3ba0a9752c56ce4537d8419ab74c8eb741463523fb3f5b2f9184a89e4c1c8260\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2FOPncB</a>). A couple of us ordered the $7 Antipasti Plate, a generous portion of Kalamata olives, balsamic-drenched asparagus spears, peppers, prosciutto, honey almonds, cheese toast, breadsticks, and Parmesan cheese wedges (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2FNfRes&s=4f625e487a051604318d9a8590c184fda3b95b496aa9d7efa1f14c1d25be4f8d\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2FNfRes</a>). Tasty treats abound.  When the rest of my team arrived, we were seated at a table that appeared to be in the middle of all the activity going on in the restaurant. I behaved and ordered the $16 Kale Salad with big slices of grilled chicken breast, heirloom tomatoes, avocado, asparagus, pine nuts, and Parmesan cheese. I had them put the lemon tahini vinaigrette on the side, a good thing since it turned out to be quite a creamy concoction (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2E5fD6l&s=0f0dab6f4d43855c0b85163745b4c9f6ab05708e6335ee1c604e01de09f4d8a9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2E5fD6l</a>). It was TGIF-good but little more. Ready for a band to play, there was a small stage at the back of the main brick wall with a big sign that said \"Four Wheels Move Your Body But Two Wheels Move Your Soul\", a shoutout to the badass bikers since the building was once a motorcycle garage (photo: <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2F2E8mx6J&s=7cf7a9e43a7573e9f0db49c047d33e129e5de9ea49d6c14fcd2ef2e7d059e4cf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bit.ly/2E8mx6J</a>).  FOOD - 3 stars...the bar bites are familiar but decently satisfying AMBIANCE - 3.5 stars...a whole lotta space if you need it SERVICE - 3.5 stars...pretty good given the number of people flooding into the place TOTAL - 3 stars...I kinda get why it's called Culinary Dropout",

Upon arrival to Culinary Dropout I was told that if I wanted to bar hop later on in the evening, I would be more than welcome to leave my car in the valet parking lot overnight. So, I did in fact bar hop, and left my car in Culinary's parking lot over a friday night and did not come back for it until Saturday night, around 5pm.  When I returned to get my car, the valet team had taped bags over the windows that I foolishly had left open, and apologized for not seeing that the windows were open the night before. It was getting cloudy that day, and although there was no surefire sign it was going to rain, the Valet team decided to tape up my windows just in case. I was very pleased at this act. On a side note, when I told them I was leaving my car overnight, they gave my keys back to me and even locked the car for me as i stood and waited. Very, Very happy with what the Valet team does over their for their guests cars.   Oh, and Valet is complimentary, as well.",

The pretzels and fondue are insanely delicious, \"Ma the meatloaf f*ck\" is delicious and hearty if you're looking for a full belly. As far as drinks go, there is a wide variety of craft beers and cocktails to choose from. The burgers are usually good, but my last visit on the 12th of January resulted in a very dried out, over cooked burger. It was later in the evening, so who knows, maybe the chefs were just ready to go home, but it was not great.   Minus 1 star for the overcooked burger. But everything else was great.",

Their patio is probably about twice as big as the dining room and complete with foosball, bags, and ping pong.

    "text": "I'm glad I finally had the chance to try Culinary Dropout. Their Tempe location has been bookmarked for a while now but I have not been getting a chance to head their way. A couple of days ago, our team's Christmas dinner was held there. It was chosen because of the Yard that's kind of attached to it where people can hang out, play games and just have a good time.   We got there at around 3:45pm on Tuesday. There is a complimentary valet service. When we arrived, I noticed that the place was slightly busy considering it's mid-week. I reviewed the main menu. They also have a happy hour menu which has a good selection of items for a good price.   With all my food intolerances, I had limited choices on the menu to select from. This was pointed out to me by the waiter who senses that I was asking questions related to food allergy items so he made sure he clarified whether I had any allergies so they would assist me in picking the right thing for me or making adjustments to any menu items I may select. I started off with the bread with oil, balsamic and basil. I also ordered French fries. Other members of my team ordered Nachos and fondue with pretzels. Feedback on all those items was very good.   A little later the waiter came back to take our orders for main dish, after going through the menu many times and crossing out things I couldn't eat, I was left with the salads particularly a chicken salad and the Shrimp Caesar salad. The waiter made sure he checked if the batter they dipped the shrimps in had eggs and suggested that he would replace them with sauteed shrimp if the batter had eggs. A few minutes later, the salad came out with the fried shrimp. The salad tasted great. There were so many shrimps, I was impressed. Never have I had a dish hay had so many shrimps outside my house! The portion looked small initially but by the end of it, it felt pretty generous, I was full.   Overall, good service and food. Prices are reasonable too with some menu items being on the more expensive side. Worth a try.",

    "text": "The CONCEPT is cool. I came here about 6 or 7 times during their 1st year. I tried the ramen, and while the ingredients were authentic and fresh, the broth had no depth. Good ramen is about broth flavor.  Later, I brought kids along. The waitress was clearly uncomfortable with kids. The food was great, the courtyard with games was great, but the service was not friendly.  Another day, I invited an associate with me for a business lunch and the waitress (different waitress) kept staring at or reading the paperwork each time she walked by. She didn't  hide it, so I am not mistaken.   Finally, I drove back again, expecting to get a gormet pretzel&cheese. I found it odd that, ahen I tried to park I was intercepted by valets who literally would not allow me to park my own car.  I can't park my car? No, ma'am.  So I went home. The clearly heard the elderly couple behind me and they left too, for the same reason.   There are things I love. I love the atmosphere, decor and co-op feel of \"THE YARD\". I appreciate the kitchen staff. Like I said, cool but not solid.   I'll have to try them again soon to see if anything has changed. My guess is the service was not that great because everything, including the staff, was still new.",

He recommended Culinary Dropout for our large group (2 other families celebrating with us).  The cliff notes version is he chose wisely.  We sampled nearly all the apps.  The deviled eggs were simple, but probably my favorite.  We split the grilled cheese sliders as well.  A few of us enjoyed the special kale salad they had, while the rest went large with the either the pub burger or pastrami.  The salads came in good portions and were full of flavor.  Those going with the sandwiches didn't leave anything on their plates.  Of course, we also enjoyed a few drinks.  Some seemed a bit pricy, but they came quick and it was a day to celebrate.  I tried the After School Special beer cocktail and was happy with my choice.  Once the meal was complete, a few of us stuck around to play some games and enjoy the atmosphere.  I could see myself frequenting this place if I lived in the area.  Therefore, from a tourist perspective, I say go for a visit.",

It's truly a great place to hang with some friends and put back a couple drinks and some pretty tasty bites. Much of their menu does not interest me as far as some of the Antipasti and cheese offerings, but I love some of the classic dishes they offer like their fried chicken and the fish and chips. I've had both and was very impressed with the quality of the dishes and the portion size (you should get a decent portion for the price you pay for some of their dishes). My favorite thing about going to Culinary Dropout though is hanging out and enjoying the nice beer selection and some of their cocktails. While sitting inside, it is pretty neat to see the open kitchen operating. I do plan on going back for brunch, which I realized as I read the menu again prior to writing my review lol. This Culinary Dropout is a solid place, especially if you're going with a group of friends!",

I had the Green Pork Chili, (Not starred), but it should have been.  Very delicious, served with awesome most Corn Bread.  The service was a bit slow, and not necessarily in sync.  For example, hour appetizer arrived, but we were almost done with it by the time they brought small plates (about 10 minutes later), so that was odd.  Definitely will be on my list to go to when I am back in town.",

We stayed at a nearby resort for our (kidless) anniversary weekend and took a lyft to the yard/culinary drop out. We were lucky to team up with a couple playing cornhole while we waited for our table. Two games later (losers!!!) We were seated.  Jeffrey, who was so awesome, was our server. He had recommendations, knowledge and a great personality. We had Thai wings for app (yummy!!) Some of the cheese/meat/veg/bread suggestions (garlic something or other goat cheese!!!) and split an entree, it was the ribeye (some special cut I don't remember) with delicious veggies and a few cocktails. We actually had dessert also. It was a caramel vanilla custard which sounds a little ordinary but was absolutely amazing.  What a perfect evening. It was our 13th anniversary celebration and couldn't have been better. I want to come back for my birthday! Great food, awesome wait and extraordinary service. Thanks!",

    "text": "The only reason this place is getting any stars at all is because the food is legit. Sadly, the horrible service out shined the very decent menu. Our server, Wendy, was the opposite of friendly. We dined on a Saturday for lunch and our party was in a fabulous mood when we sat down! 80 degree weather, a fun atmosphere and great drinks on tap...perfect. Sadly, our experience didn't play out that way at all. After sitting down at our table we waited 15 minutes to be greeted. We ordered drinks and waited another 10 minutes minimum. At this point we still didn't even have so much as waters for our parched party. Never were we approached with a smile or apology and that would have gone a long way. We ordered our food (traveling with 4 small children) and that took an hour from when we placed it. It was going from bad to worse.  During all of this nonsense our server was nowhere to be found! No check in at all! Finally the food arrives and she isn't even the one to deliver it. That's neither here nor there but she also never stopped back to see how we were doing. In fact, our children were getting to full meltdown mode at this point and when i finally saw her I asked for the check. I was again met with an annoyed stare. I can only hope that some outside circumstance was controlling her mood. I can't help but think that if you are in the service industry and your restaurant is backed up, a sure fired way to keep the customer happy is with a friendly attitude or a touch of sincerity/accountability. Note to future customers: have patience and low expectation, order the pretzel appetizer and request to be seated with a congenial person who is willing to make your day better and not worse.",

Especially at a concept style restaurant!  Yes the concept draws people in but the service and food needs to keep them coming back.  Waitress greeted us promptly took our drink order. From there 10 minutes for 2 beers and a 2 mixed drinks; it was only 4:30 so it wasn't that busy.  We ordered an appetizer and our entrees together.  It was about 35-40 mins. From the time we sat down until our food came... out waitress was nowhere to be found to ask what was going on.  Then our food arrived; however we never got our appetizer (the pretzel fondue everyone raves about) the food runner didn't know what we were talking about.  She didn't apologize just stated she'll get our waitress.  Before the runner left my sister in law noticed she didn't get dressing with her salad.  The runner just stared at her for 30 seconds we started looking at each other thinking it was some joke... she then says with an attitude umm I need to know what dressing you want.  We told her then she brought it back and with a smug tone she says \"Here's your dressing love bug!!\"  WTF if you were my employee I'd fire you in the spot!!!!! At that time our waitress shows up, didn't apologize about the pretzels ((acted like this happens so much that they were used to it; they've become calloused to kitchen mistakes) we cancelled the order due to our entrees being out.  Didn't offer to comp it nothing just said ok and walked away.  Dinner was done we were getting our check still no acknowledgment of the pretzels not coming out.  Didn't thank us for coming and walked away.  WOW!! I am in the food service business and can't believe this happened... seems like it happens often from other reviews too!  Might be back to try the pretzels one day but most likely try a different place to eat.",

So nice to find an establishment that takes customer feedback to heart.  I hope we can return soon....  Food was amazing, but we couldn't hear each other talking.  We went on a Sunday at 1pm...why is there a DJ with crazy loud music on a Sunday afternoon?  We asked our waiter if there was a place where it would be easier to talk, but he didn't think so.  He said there is a DJ there on Sundays starting at 12:30, so if we wanted to come when it was quieter, we could come between 11am and 12:30.  Back to the food...the cheesesteak is crazy good!  Melt-in-your mouth, just the right amount of cheese, yummy au jus...best I've had anywhere.  Others in our party got the kale & sweet potato salad, ahi tuna salad, pub burger, and kids' meals with chicken fingers and mac and cheese.  Everyone said hands down that the food was incredible.  We all agreed, though, that we won't come back unless the loud music is toned down.    It's a fun place with great games to play and a wonderful vibe...I really think it could be just as hip if the music was tamed.  I hope it does get turned down, because I'm going to be craving that cheesesteak!!",

    "text": "Probably some of the worst service I've ever had. After being seated and waiting over 20 minutes to get a server to acknowledge us, I finally asked if someone was assigned to the area we were sitting. One waiter finally assured meThat someone was coming. No one came. I finally caught the attention of two servers and asked if they wanted us to leave. Finally our drink order was taken. A third server brought our drinks and hurried without asking or taking our order. Finally a fourth pleasant woman came and apologized, took our order and treated us very well the rest of our time there. She Comp'd most of our bill, which I was pleasantly surprised. I would have bumped this up to three stars except for when I was leaving I decided to use the restroom. For a nice establishment it was completely atrocious. Toilet paper everywhere and wipes on the floor empty toilet paper rolls in the stall. I'm not looking for things to be picky about but at this point all I can think to myself as if I was the owner of this establishment I would be horrified with my staff. Decent food great ambience really cool concept terrible staff.",

Several coworkers and myself decided to try this place after a long day and to put it lightly the service was not up to par. I ordered a grilled chicken sandwich with no bacon and a side salad. What I received was a chicken sandwich with bacon and fries. The server didn't write any of our orders down and rarely checked the table. He did not seem to notice that I really didn't touch my food while they were simple mistakes it was enough to make me lose my appetite. I removed the bacon and had a couple bites the food tasted delicious however the service was truly awful. I hope they improve considering this restaurant was highly recommended to me by locals I feel I need to try another location and hope for better!",

We ordered the house potato chips that came with an onion dip...yummy!  I ordered the kale and sweet corn salad and my husband ordered the meatloaf. Both meals were fantastic and more than we could eat!  Both the manager Kyle and the server Calvin came over several times to check on us.  Kyle not only saved the evening and our opinion of the restaurant, but his actions and kindness convinced me to use the facility for an upcoming event.  Kyle is a True manager. He took control of a bad situation and completely changed the outcome. I admire his abilities.",

I live near the Biltmore and saw there was one in Phoenix while browsing Yelp and so I wanted to try it out ASAP! Hubby and I went for happy hour and we were beyond impressed. For as nice a restaurant it is, and for such high quality, the happy hour prices were beyond exceptional. Drinks no more than 5 bucks and food no more than 6. Hubby and I got only the happy hour specials, I must say the pork belly nachos were phenomenal. This might sound odd, but the best part were the chips! They tasted house made. My husband totally agreed too. Everything was cool. Loved the atmosphere. We'll be back and can't wait to bring friends!",

So 4 stars as a place to drink, 2 stars for food which is how I arrive at 3 stars.  I was going to give it 4 stars but went somewhere afterwards that had an amazing kick-ass meet & cheese spread for $8.",

I gave this place 3 stars due to closing at 12pm. Really?! It was still packed and everyone was enjoying themselves playing the yard games. Also, we got there about 9 and couldn't find parking. Valet was full and they have signs stating you will get a ticket if you park on the street. We ended up going to a bar down the street for an hour or so since we couldn't park there. I'm glad we gave it a second drive by and got parking at 10:30pm because we had a great time until it suddenly closed at 12.",

Otherwise, I've either felt let down because I expected too much or I didn't let myself have a good time because I nit picked everything. Well for whatever reason I couldn't help but have high expectations of this place. Thankfully, it was one of the times where I was not let down! I came here around 9 one night recently. I had heard about the long waits, so I had held off for a while but finally broke down and dragged a friend with me after work one night. She parked on the street, I valeted. For as busy as it was, my friend said there was plenty of street parking, I just wasn't paying attention. There was several cars in front of me, but the line moved fast, and I only had to wait a couple minutes before it was whisked off by some kid who probably just got his license last week (not complaining about skill, he just looked barely old enough to drive). We walked right in and put our name on the list and had about a 30-45 min wait (which turned out to only be 25 min) so we walked to the bar ordered a couple drinks and went and sat in the Adirondack chairs by the ping pong tables. We sat, talked, watched people playing ping pong and having a good time. The atmosphere was loud, fun, and happy. Once we received the text that our table was ready, the hostess walked us to our table and introduced our server who was friendly and sweet. we asked for recommendations and wound up ordering some cheese and pickled peppers to start which where delicious. For our entrees, I had the fish and chips and she had the corn cannelloni. Wow! Seriously, some of the best fish and chips I have ever had. Light, buttery, flaky fish with flavorful, crunchy breading. My friends cannelloni was delicious as well, I only tasted a bite (I was surprised I was allowed that much) so I can't go too in depth about its deliciousness, but I would definitely order it for myself next time. The portions were big, I took one piece of fish, half my fries and all my cole slaw home and she took almost half of her dish home. For pickled peppers, cheese, fish and chips, cannelloni and 4 glasses of wine, our bill was $68. I don't know what people are complaining about. I really don't. The prices are typical, the portions were good sizes, the drinks were big, the service was impeccable and valet is pretty standard for central and downtown Phoenix. I absolutely loved the Yard and can't wait to come back. All of you haters can go back to your suburban Olive Gardens and Applebees.",

The reality: Waitstaff is hired based on clothing size (nothing over a size 4) and looks. Which means, if they manage to get your order right, they will probably drop it at the wrong table; or dump the food and run, not bothering ot see if you have/need utensils. Also do not have the audacity to be thirst. ever. There's no 2nd pint of beer/glass of wine/ice tea refill to be had here. You will have better luck finding water in the desert.  Lastly, if you make it here long enough to get dessert - If you'd like a clean utensil to eat said dessert you have 2 choices: 1 bring your own clean fork,  Or  put your hands behind your back and have your own 1women/man tarte eating contest.   The food - Its hit or miss. The \"hit\" is firmly in the land of 'meh' and the miss, is when you start having that debate in your head ' should I send this back, or should I leave'; this makes the food feel very over priced and stuffy. Clearly we are paying for the eye candy waitstaff, not the food.   I've given them 2 separate tries to get it right and they failed miserably on both, I'm out.",

They should put in more seating around the patio so people can chill while waiting. It's loud and fun. Good place to hang out with a group of friends. Food and drinks are pricey for the environment though. Be prepared to wait if you come during peak times. Tip: Don't be rude by keeping game equipment while you're not using them; give them back if eating/drinking so others can enjoy.",

He had a little attitude. About the food, I ordered a Moscow mule, an IPA beer that was fruity, artichoke hearts dip, pretzels with cheese fondue and \"Soup from the day before.\" The artichoke hearts were pretty good. The presentation was good also, definitely not the average artichoke hearts. The pretzels with cheese fondue was pretty good. The pretzels were soft and the cheese was also delicious. Lastly, my soup was okay thought it could have had more chunks of veggies and seafood. Maquel our bartender was pretty awesome. She was very good about explaining the food and beers! This place is good for crowds and catching up because of the space and outdoor areas.",

Still no fondue despite asking bartender 3 times. I also ordered the most delicious spring veggie salad about 35 minutes ago (thinking it would come quicker) but still NO food. And I finished my drink 20 minutes ago and no one has asked if I want another. There are 5-6 bartenders and the bar isn't that packed. What gives??? Oh, and let me mention that others at the bar who ordered after me are already done with their food. And let me make clear: neither my dining companion nor I are ugly or rude!!!",

Our server, Raegan, was excellent  - upbeat and  knowledgeable  She checked back several times to see how our food was. This is unusual, anymore, an upbeat, attentive server.  The food was OK , yet pricey- not the usual Fox Concepts quality that we have come to expect.   All in all, except for the server,  a disappointing experience so we will not be returning here.",

We started out with a few beers, decent selection. Bf got a jack and coke which was very watered down. We sat out in the Yard, which is very nice open area with TONS of games. Service was friendly and fast. So, for the food:  Started with pretzel bites and cheese fondue. This carb filled, melt in your mouth guilt trip is DELICIOUS. Definitely a must order if you're not watching your weight.   I ordered their 36 hour jalapeno molasses ribs. I was pretty disappointment. The ribs were dry and had a strange flavor. Expected something way better for $23.   Boyfriend ordered the prime rib dip. The au jus was really good and the meat to bread ratio was decent. HOWEVER, they put a bunch of mayo on the sandwich, which they do not mention on the menu. Boyfriend hates mayo. Who puts mayo on a prime rib dip? He opted to the soup of the day as his side, which was actually fantastic. It was a bean, sausage vegetable soups.   If you do not like big crowds, do not come here on the weekends. Great atmosphere. Hit or miss food. Will be willing to come back to try other things before giving a higher review.",

    "text": "So this is probably the weirdest place for food best for drinks and entertainment. Their valet is terrible when I pulled up I got out of the car and the valley gave me a ticket and then walked away for a few minutes meanwhile my car is running and the door open with no valet near it. What's to keep somebody from stealing my car while waiting to be parked? Then my friends and I go back to valet when we're leaving and there's a bunch of drunk guys just hanging out with the valet so it's unclear where the valet is so I go around the drunk group of guys give my ticket to the valet he gets my car brings it over said bye to my friends and once again leaves the car door open and running by itself and one of the drunk guys gets in my car and revs my cars engine. I was livid. Some drunk stranger in my car I'm so upset with the poor service and lack of respect Culinary Drop out has.  this was already my least favorite place because of the parking situation only being valet but now I will never recommend this place to my friend and family.",

Today, we came for a Friday happy hour and had a great time! Our waitress, Izzy, provided great service and always made sure our drinks were full. She even was accommodating with moving us to a larger table when an extra friend joined us! The vibe is great for laid back, social people that are looking for a fun place to play games, eat great food, and hang at the bar. I recommend grabbing a drink and some food at the bar before heading over to the yard for a game of corn hole! Be careful on the weekends though, it can get super busy!! However, this place is definitely worth a wait.",

Server said they were told it was because it may \"overload the staff/management wifi,\" and that a lot of employees \"use laptops around the restaurant.\"  LOL.  2. Valet parking only. Street parking mostly limited to residents.  3.  EXTREMELY EXPENSIVE FOOD AND DRINKS.  4.  Small TVs, most of which have a glare.  5.  Poor bar service. Bartenders talk amongst themselves rather than serve the very few customers at the bar.  No wonder this place is mostly empty.",

We had drinks while we waited for a table. Nice selection of beverages. The food and service were excellent. We ordered the meatloaf and the honey-drizzled fried chicken. Both plates came with more trample sides and all of it was delicious. Although the restaurant was really noisy, it was still a comfortable atmosphere. Definitely a place I want to visit on a week night to compare the experience to a Saturday night..",

    "text": "This place is exceptional!!! Since moving back to the area I've driven by a few times and was always intrigued by what was behind those walls. Well let me tell you heaven my friend, heaven is behind those walls.   From the get go at valet, where my door was opened for me (I was the passenger) and greeted with a smile.  I knew this was going to be a good time.   Seated quite quickly outside, 'cuz it's spring in Phoenix and if you are not sitting outside at every opportunity you are crazy!  The Yard is so fun and such a relaxing atmosphere.  But it was our server Jeff that truly made this an incredible experience.  This kid, was fun, attentive and knowledgable. I normally have to ask my waiters what their top three favorite items are on the menu.  But NOT so with Jeff.  He quickly have us a tour of all the menus pointing out his favorite in every section.  You could tell this boy knew his stuff and enjoyed it.   We started with cocktails and the black mussels... OH MY!!! DE-lish!!! I try to stay away from starches but this broth made me break down and eat a half of the thick cut amazingly baked bread (on site! everything is made ON SITE) I had another artisan cocktail and the Shrimp Ceasar Salad... oh my!  I have no idea what they put on the shrimp or in the dressing but, I'll be back for more of that! My husband had the Italian Grinder (highly recommended by Jeff) not a thing was left on his plate. We asked Jeff a ton of questions, which he knew the answer to most and if he didn't he went and asked.   Had to order the Salted Caramel Custard for dessert because Salted! AND Caramel!!! Hellooo!  I shouldn't have eaten as much as I did but OH my tastebuds were in their happy place!   Kyle the manager came over and check on us... great guy.  You can tell the people who work here, really love their job.   Needless to say we left stuffed as if it were Thanksgiving. We will surely be back!!   Thanks Jeff!!!",

With The Yard just walking distance from our dinner table it made for a really fun night out.  The food however was ok.  Three of us ordered salmon dishes which could have been part of it.  Maybe fish isn't what you should get when you go there but it wasn't anything over the top that I would drive back there for.  I would however go back for the experience.  I will say though the pretzels and smoky cheese fondue was my favorite part of the meal.  A must have if you are stopping.  Music, games, atmosphere were all great.  One of the people with us ordered a sandwich that looked well done but for sandwiches I'm always heading to Ike's in Mesa from now on.  Overall a fun spot with ok food.",

Makes no sense to me to pull something off a hot grill, stick it in the fridge then serve it on a plate. Long story short, I like my grilled asparagus hot.  Sweet potato cannelloni with mushrooms was simply delicious, but scarce. The dish wasn't terribly expensive, but for the amount of money I would have liked more. I am not a fan of mushrooms, but ate those just because I was still hungry. I came really close to licking the plate instead I just nibbled on my husbands fries.  Our waiter was also the bartender. Water glasses were never refilled because he was busy at the bar. Lastly, the music was too loud for a lunch crowd.",

The valet parking was a very nice touch, We were greeted by 3 very friendly hosts at the door and were seated right away. Decided on inside, but will go out on the patio next time. Isabella was our server and she was great. Very attentive and very patient as we had an older gentleman in our group of 4. Wife and I first split the house salad with ginger dressing. It was fresh and the dressing livened up the salad superbly. We then split the Summer Corn Cannelloni. This dish is beyond belief. While the noodle was more like a traditional ravioli, the stuffing of corn, mascarpone cheese and a touch of truffle oil made this memorable. Our friends had the fish and chips and they enjoyed every bite.   This is another FRC restaurant and Sam Fox has another winner. Since we moved to the Valley in February, we've visited several of the FRC places and have loved each one of them. Please come to the West Valley ASAP, please. I think my wife and I will make our next visit to The Yard a progressive and visit all 3 restaurants, taking in the best of each. Looking forward to doing that very soon.",

We usually go to the Culinary Dropout in Scottsdale, but last night decided to check out one of the other locations, and chose the one at The Yard in Phoenix. The band playing was fantastic, the staff happy, friendly and uplifting as always, the food mouthwatering exceptional, and my scotch pour was on par. Nothing is ever chincy or half done at any of the Fox restaurants we have gone to, and as a result have decided that Fridays are our Fox nights! In our conversation with the waiter and then the manager, we commented that everyone is always happy; everyone - the staff and costumers! It's also so wonderful watching management helping, the manager Ezekiel last night cleared the table for our waiter - an act of True leadership. We chose the French dip, potato chips and onion dip for our entree, which was out of this world perfection. The french roll was the perfect texture, not too dry, not too soft; the roast beef beautifully flavored and prepared; the au jus - wonderful beyond words. The confections at all of the Fox restaurants are consistently  magical delights that I suspect are conjured up by fairies incognito.",

Sat there for five or more minutes before anyone came to out table, fifteen minutes for drinks, ten minutes later gave our order, food came out nice and hot. Sat for the longest time with empty plates in front of us, fifteen minutes to get one to go box. Ordered dessert then, twenty minutes later it finally arrived.

It was delicious and our taste buds were happy.  Here's what we had.    A share plate of 5 Antipasti items (small portions packed with flavor):   - Jamon Iberico, truffled crescent and crusty bread, garlic oil & balsamic - delicious combo of flavors and texture - Korean-style brussel sprouts (with sauce on the side) - crunchy, crispy, charred brussel sprouts with a little spicy and sweet chili paste sauce to balance the slight bitterness of brussel sprouts. - charred broccoli, red chili oil, parmesan breadcrumb - with a squeeze of lemon juice, it was crunchy, crispy and savory with a tiny amount of tart and spice.    BBQ PORK BELLY NACHOS - It was exactly what you would want in a great plate of nachos. Great to share, so you don't overdo it.  BISTRO STEAK with horseradish cream, peppercorn bordelaise, herb fries - Steak portion is small (that's not a bad thing necessarily, since it's built in portion control!) and it was cooked to perfection at medium rare and the horseradish cream sauce was awesome, as were the herb fries.  Drinks:  The old fashioned and manhattan cocktails were citrus infused and nicely presented, stirred, on the rocks.    Excellent menu and drink selection.  Great customer service by the wait staff (very important factor in a restaurant).  They have the right balance and know how to make the customers feel at home.  Two thumbs up to the management, kitchen and service staff.",

    "text": "This was a horrible experience. We selected Culinary Dropout because we've had so many good experiences here. My husband's boss was in town with his family - our job was to find a fun spot to go for lunch on a Sunday with kids - Culinary Dropout seems perfect.   We were a table of 9 - 4 adults and 5 kids. Management wouldn't move us inside (except to a high top, which doesn't work for small children), even though the outdoor area was literally BAKING under the metal roof. They didn't offer to move us if we waited 15, 45, 120 minutes ... nope, they literally just said no. It wasn't just the hostesses - there was a manager at the host stand too.  When our server finally comes along we order drinks - drinks take forever. She told us \"I'm just rolling with it today - the bartender is new and keeps losing tickets. I hope you get your drinks soon\". REALLY? Drinks sit empty on the table for no less than 20 minutes. Server comes by to see if drinks have arrived, we report that they haven't (as evidenced by empty glasses on the table) and she says ok, and wanders off to another table (not to the BAR where she could OBTAIN the drinks from).   Then the food takes forever. Icing on the cake: they fail to deliver the boss' wife's salad with the rest of the food. We alert many employees to the problem. Server comes back to the table and says \"that's weird, they have it marked off as delivered\" and then wanders around aimlessly - doing nothing about the missing salad. We lose sight of her for a bit, and she comes back 10 minutes later and says the kitchen is remaking it. All the adult food is cold at this point, because we're waiting for the salad to be delivered before we start eating. Another 10 minutes go by - still no salad. Server comes over and says the kitchen is still working on it. It's a freakin salad with salmon - how long could it possibly take to make? Manager finally delivers salad, w/server trailing closely behind him. Manager offers a muttered apology, says he will \"take care of the salad\" and says he will come back around in a few minutes to check on us. Of course he doesn't. I've never had such apathetic service in my life.  PS - Forced valet sucks.",

I'm a meat eater, but I would definitely have the butternut squash with chicken on the side, which was offered by our amazing waiter. That was our second time going to this establishment and once again, they did not disappoint. Highly recommend.",

    "text": "Unique gastropub this is not.  Any restaurant that needs to specifically state on it's website the following:  \"the chefs on the line with silver-studded ears and mohawk hairdo, to the inked-up, decked-out bar staff mixologists shaking and stirring some of the most creative cocktails, we're all dropouts here.,\"  I find to be totally ridiculous marketing nonsense.  Silly me, I didn't realize that those individuals with multiple earrings and tattoos should be considered dropouts.    In that case, I guess I should give up my M.S. degree and professional career because I have a lot of ear piercings and tattoos as well.  Now, onto the food.  I had the garden kale salad.  It was uninspired.  Nothing I couldn't have easily made at home and probably would have done a better job.  For an appetizer, I sampled the pretzels with the provolone fondue.  As expected, they were just as dull as they were when I tried them at sister restaurant Arrogant Butcher.  The atmosphere is loud and you can play games here.  I guess cause that is what dropouts do.  They have mohawks, mix drinks, and play ping pong.  Maybe its just me, but I just find it really stupid and annoying that Fox restaurant group specifically created a concept and restaurant idea based around this notion.  Instead of trying way too hard to be clever, I think they should focus on improving the mediocre service and the boring menu.",

They don't have anyone walking around to order drinks or get any kind of assistance so the only option is to walk up to the bar. Blonde bearded Bartender seemed annoyed or inconvenienced any time we came to the bar to order a drink- lots of eye rolls and sighs. Then after we closed out the bartender called me over to ask why we didn't tip him more. Seriously called out to me from across the room and waved me over. Our tip wasn't over generous but was fair for our total bill. I was shocked, it was a Wednesday night and wasn't incredibly busy. Wish this wouldn't have been my first experience.",

I eat gluten free due to a health issue, and our server walked me through the GF options on happy hour menu. We didn't make it past that because once I saw their nachos were GF, I was decided.  I asked if the fries my husband ordered were cooked in a designated fryer.  I was told his weren't, but they do have a designated fryer for cooking gluten free fries!!  They have a decent hard cider offering.  I tried the prickly pear, which was pretty good.  Later when trying to figure out if a certain liquor used in one of their cocktails was GF, the server was very helpful in helping me identify the specific manufacturer and liquor so I could google.  Everyone went above and beyond what I expected.  It was a great experience.",

It's well lit, not overly loud, and spaced for just the right amount of movement and interaction. It's further from downtown than I usually venture, but for dinner and a full night out with a group, it was worth the trek. As a cocktail gal, I wouldn't come back just for drinks.   For dinner, I ordered the pierogies, which were covered in a delicious, creamy, vinegary sauce and served with some veggies. It wasn't a huge portion but it was worth it and I'd go for it again if there weren't so many other appealing menu options.  I was really disappointed that they were out of bread pudding, but friends and I shared the buttermilk pie instead and it was good. Fans of cheesecake with a fruity touch will love it.   My one issue was service in the larger outdoor area. When I arrived, I met up with friends sitting by the bar and was told by staff that I couldn't bring food outside. I sat there for my dinner, but this restriction turned out to be inaccurate and another person served us dessert outside at the one area where our whole group could fit. It seemed a little understaffed at the beginning of the night but I appreciated the help in keeping my friends hydrated.",

Never been there before I just read Yelp reviews like everyone else and decided let's come here instead of a fancy shmancy place... so we did! Well we got there they seated us after 20 minutes when we already had reservations. They were still setting up a lot of group tables. Completely understand it's probably one of the busiest day for restaurant business. Food... Level 3, In n Out has better burgers! Salad no taste, Id rather go to Salad to go. The only tasty thing on the menu were the pork ribs. There was 8 of us so I probably got to see a lot of the dishes. So we were joking bc maybe the reason the name of the restaurant was \"Culinary Drop Out\" is because they dropped out of culinary School  I just loved their play area... that's all folks!!!",

    "text": "Also known as part of \"the yard\" this is a really cool spot. Most of the space is a giant patio like area with different seating set ups, ping pong and cornhole, and just space to hang out.   Valet parking is your only bet basically, but it's a smooth process and worth tipping the guys for.   While waiting for everyone to arrive, we grabbed a beer at the bar outside. They have beer in a bag for $2 which is a random can of beer. My friend ended up with a Milwaukee's best, but hey that's a deal! I grabbed a can of four peaks peach.   We came with a large group to just chill with and had a reservation for 7. Granted there were 15+ in our group, but they planned to seat us at two smaller tables pushed together and one of those tables was not remotely close to being done/ready to leave upon our arrival. After some confusion with management around the table, we were finally seated at two separate tables close to each other, with about ten of us at one. They actually sent us out a couple of appetizers to apologize for the craziness.   The pretzel bites were awesome. Seriously, they are huge pieces and the cheese dip isn't too cheesy it's just right. I would order these again for sure.   When it came to main courses, most of us were just drinking and after the appetizers were weren't looking to order full entrees. I ended up ordering the tuna tartare which came with some bread. It was a mix of tuna, avocado, cashew and spicy mayo. It was light and tasty, a perfect app to share in you're in the mood.   The service was on the slow end BUT we had large groups and were spending lots of time chatting. We were in no rush so it worked for us. This is a laid back environment to have some drinks and enjoy your company. Our server was so nice and handled all of our separate checks perfectly.   I'd recommend this place for drinks and apps, a happy hour kind of place. I can't speak to the entrees but I would assume they are tasty as well.",

    "text": "Let's get one thing out of the way at the start.  The Culinary Dropout is not particularly the kind of place to which I'd be drawn.  I rarely consume alcohol, never beer, and have a deep-set and abiding dislike of pretentious establishments.  That said, when driving by, the construction of the Yard makes it intriguing.  Enough to make me research it a bit online and want to try it at least once.  Not enough to make me hand over my car to valet parking - \"free\" or otherwise - but enough that, when walking past on a Sunday at around 11AM my wife and I decided to give it a try.  I'd like to review the food first, but since it took us a long time to get our food, it seems only fair to put the food near the end.  At 11AM, the restaurant was not busy, with about 75% of the seats empty, both inside and out.  We were warned that only one server had shown up yet, so we had an expectation that things might take a while.  That said, there were at least 10 or more staff (of some kind) running around the place - at least four seemed to be visiting tables for various reasons.  Despite the seating being quite empty, their seating strategy seems to be to pack 'em in together as closely as possible.  In our case, the corner was packed in first, which put my wife and I about 18\" away on either side of two largish (loud, but not unruly) groups.  Perhaps they were expecting to be very full in the near future, but they never passed 50%.  It's clear this would be a good place for a large group of people, but not so much for intimate dining.  It seemed to take an unusually long time for us to get our menus.  We learned that they didn't have any menus to spare.  The table next to us had 12-15 menus and were taking their jolly old time deciding what to eat.  Perhaps they were hoarding all the menus?  While waiting for them to order and have their menus re-distributed to the menu poor, we ordered soft drinks and an appetizer, Cheddar Pork Cracklings.  As I'd previously researched the place online, I had an idea of what was on their menu, and what I might be interested in trying.  I was caught by surprise when menus finally did arrive and they were serving the brunch menu.  Nothing that I specifically wanted to try was being served.  I settled for the fish and chips, which can be very hit-or-miss in restaurants.  My wife had the Smoked Salmon Avocado Toast.  Let's talk about the service.  There's no getting around it - it was slow.  Everyone was very pleasant and very friendly, but things were just really slow.  While we didn't experience any particular problems with our orders, the gang next to us did, and, as we were practically shoulder-to-shoulder with them, I got to see how the staff handled the problem.  Both the waitress and her manager handled the problem extremely well - at least from my standpoint, and, based on their reactions, the customers were satisfied, too.  One note about the restrooms.  They use that trick of having two side-by-side doors, labelled \"Women\" and \"Men\" but both lead to exactly the same room.  That room is further subdivided by gender; however, if your timing is just right and you're caught unaware, you could find yourself walking into the \"men's room\" only to come face to face with a woman - or vice-versa.  Cute joke or cruel way to make you think you just had a stroke and can no longer read signs?  You decide.  And now finally the food.  The Cheddar Pork Cracklings were really enjoyable.  They were still warm when they were served, which I'm going to assume means they just made them and not that they just dumped them out of a bag and nuked them.  The white cheddar cheese was more of a crumbly dusting and added a nice counterpoint to the flavor.  Would recommend again.  The fish and chips were not bad.  I didn't think to ask and I'm not sure what type of fish they were.  It's not always a given that fish and chips are cod these days, and I couldn't tell.  The batter was quite nice and almost delicately flakey.  Considering how light the batter turned out, there was a fair amount of grease forming up under the fish, though.  They're not putting any chippies out of business with this dish, but it was perfectly serviceable.  The chips/fries were fresh, with skins.  They were a bit soft for my liking, but they were clearly good.  My wife was trying avocado toast for the first time and while she wouldn't give me an in-depth review, she said she was \"...glad she tried it once.\"  Read into that what you will.  I'm a bit conflicted on this review.  We were warned that they were short of wait-staff, so I can't fault them much for delays in that area. The staff were great.  The food good, but not extraordinary.  The ambience was definitely more \"big group of co-workers stopping by after work\" than \"quiet dinner for two.\"  While we won't be heading back anytime soon, I certainly wouldn't discourage people from going there.",

It's a high energy place and although we didn't take part in any of the yard activities, we still enjoyed the fun atmosphere.  The appetizers were very yummy, particularly the (yellow) beets w/goat cheese and the crusty bread. The salmon entree was spectacular. It melted in my mouth and had a wonderful, flavorful crusty texture on top. The rest of the plate was delicious, too (black rice, cauliflower, pea pods, etc.) My mouth is watering as I type this! It will be very hard for me to try something else after having that dish.  The monkey bread dessert took awhile and was good, but I'm glad it was \"on the house\" due to our long wait. It would've taken an AMAZING dessert to top the salmon entree. We will return!!",

    "text": "I've been to Culinary Dropout at the Yard a couple times for happy hour with friends since the venue is pretty large and has good number of outdoor games like cornhole/bags, ping pong, table shuffleboard, and foosball! Today, however, we came for a birthday lunch (mine!). After a morning hike on Camelback, we were starving, so we ordered the pork belly nachos to share. I was incredibly impressed by the crispness of the tortilla chips! The toppings (queso, guacamole, salsa, and black beans) were delicious as well, but there definitely could have been a little more pork belly to match the amount of chips present. For my entree, my roommate and I shared the pub burger and the kitchen was kind enough to split the order so we didn't have to do it ourselves! The burger was delicious! The BBQ sauce was savory and tangy, the bacon was crisp, and the patty was moist. The brioche bun was also perfectly toasted. The side of fries were crispy and a great accompaniment to the burger. My boyfriend ordered the meatloaf and I was able to try some of his dish. The meatloaf was flavorful and moist, the green beans were cooked and seasoned nicely, and the mashed potatoes were so smooth and mixed well with the gravy. For my birthday, dessert was on the house. I decided on the monkey bread. The monkey bread was topped with apples sauteed in brown sugar and cinnamon. The vanilla bean ice cream that was served on the side was delicious! While the monkey bread had so much good cinnamon flavor, I think the monkey bread was not fully cooked in the middle.  I will definitely be back for more fun and games!",

We also had chili soup and it was full of flavor and just the right amount rod spice!   I would get both dishes again!

The portion is so large (good thing) that we took the extra home with dreams of using them for home made sliders. We also ordered the deviled eggs which have a delicious earthy flavor that I believe comes from truffle oil.  Just order them! Our last app was the beet dish.  Not a fan and I love beets.  They just were not anything special and were drenched in a balsamic dressing that was lack luster at best. Dessert rocked.  We had the carmel corn and the salted carmel custard. Yum. The room is large, noisy and conducive to having a good time.  Ask for the corner table for the best people watching,  Oh and order a mule to get things started!",

Haven't been entirely impressed w/ Fox Restaurant Concepts in the past, but decided to try it out after seeing the roadside transformation during our frequent drives home, along 7th Street.    Parking situation is ridiculous.  Blocking off the medium size lot to valet only clientele is annoying, considering The Yard (the covered bar area mostly belonging to Culinary Depot) is looking to be lined w/ several more businesses, including a coffee shop/bakery.    Gave up my cell number at the hostess station and informed of a 25 minute wait, which wasn't too bad for a new, buzzed about Phoenix location.  By the time they texted (an impressive 10 minutes quicker than estimated) we'd already found a place at one of the bar tables out back and been served drinks by a polite waitress.  Sipped adequately potent 10$ drinks as we waited for our third and received no attitude for excessive lounging.  Crowd ranged from upper class urban to downtown hipsters, all ages, including kids, but the latter disappeared after dark, replaced by scantily clad ladies and their young gentlemen friends.   Food was unimpressive, considering they're touting themselves as a gastropub (Meatloaf: Terribly ketchupy, Grilled Cheese: A bit crusty, Cannelloni: Inhaled, assumed okay.) but all in all the ambiance was all right.  Wouldn't necessarily return for dinner, but might hang out having a few drinks w/ friends on a lazy Sunday evening.    Bar section is open and wheelchair friendly, free of steps.",

In all reality this place is great for hanging out and mingling with single people, or for a first date. The restaurant has good size and live music, and a huge outdoor section with multiple outdoor activities that attracts the younger crowd, such as foosball and ping pong tables. The younger crowd can get rowdy like at any bar.   However, the parking situation can be frustrating with their vallet parking. A lot of their patrons resort to having to park in places where they risk their cars being towed or across the street. The professionalism aspect is not there, due to all of their employees wearing regular casual cothes. You can imagine the lack of customer service this could create when problems arise. Finally this is a restaurant that closes at midnight on weekends, but they have this huge yard for entertainment while they have a full bar. They could get more revenue if they kept the bar and yard open until 2 am.",

    "text": "I survived through a 9-month hellish short sale process just to live closer to the numerous eateries that engulf this area.  So, \"Hello, Culinary Dropout, we are both new to the neighborhood.\"    To be honest, I wasn't expecting a lot from the new Culinary Dropout because the original one on Camelback did not impress me that much.  (There is a certain smell to it that just does not work for my senses. Sorry!)  BUT, the new one is BEAUTIFULLY renovated with a fun atmosphere and is quite aesthetically pleasing in every way.  From the game area outside to the warmly lit dining area inside, the new Culinary Dropout mixes Olive 'n Ivy's charm with the Vig's outdoor concept.    The Yard will soon become the \"go-to\" place for those who need a break from the reality that is happening outside the fence.    The only reason why I am giving it 4 stars instead of a solid 5 stars is because it does not deserve it yet.  I have been to the Culinary Dropout for the last two days just to give a quick and fair assessment, and the timing of the food is not all there.  I understand that your name implies you dropped out of culinary school, and it is my fault for going to eat at your place despite this issue.    However, you cannot serve me cold food.     The first day, I ordered three items from the appetizer section, the fried chicken platter, and the meatloaf dish.  The entrees and the appetizers came out about two minutes from each other.  The mashed potatoes and the biscuit were cold while the fried chicken was hot - indicating that the side dishes were just sitting there waiting until the chicken was deep fried.    The second day, I sat at the bar to get the feel of that area, and the appetizers took FOREVER to come out.  How long does it take to warm up some pretzels and melt cheese in a bowl?  Apparently, it takes about 45 minutes to an hour.  The bartender (who was awesome) felt bad, so he entertained me for the time being.  Overall, the food is a solid OKAY.  Food was never Fox Concepts' best trait in comparison to the better restaurants in the area, but I know that the company focuses on creating delightful hangout spot for its patrons.  I will definitely visit again soon to see how they progress through the upcoming months.",

Wonderfully comfortable seating and they had a whole area dedicated to games like ping pong and bean bag toss. I want to go back just to enjoy some of that! They get kudos for the whole setup.  I decided to get the (what I considered expensive) roast beef au jus. Let me say, I do not know WTF they were thinking. First off, not enough meat, then they decided to butter the bread inside (wait for it...) and then put mayo along with onions and the beef. YACK, it was so greasy. I compare eating that to eating the nasty mayo-ey ultimate cheeseburger from Jack in the box. You end up not wanting to eat everything because the greasy mayo-ey mess is nauseating. To top it off, not enough fries either and to be honest I wish they offered a healthier side option because that was too much fattiness.   I will go back and give them another try, but that sandwich alone put me off. I think I want to just go drink and play ping pong...sorry CD.",

It took so long for our waitress to come we started to think ordering food was \"self-serving\" as well. That being siad, our waitress was very pleasant and interaction was great however we spent a lot of time flagging her down. Maybe service would have been better if we sat indoors? As for the food we got the ribs and the pretzel/fondue dish. I found both well made and tasty I would say I found my ribs a little too salty and they combined with the salty fries were a little much but the ribs were still one of the most tinder rib dishes I've ever had so if you'd don't mind the salt I'd say get it.",

    "text": "Friday night, four of us went to the pre-opening event at Culinary Dropout benefiting Local First Arizona. The place has a wonderful upscale, casual feel were you would be as comfortable in a business suit or shorts and flip flips.  Prices were what I expect from the Fox Restaurant Concepts. The most expensive entree on the menu was the Korean Style Ribeye Cap. I had the Shaved Prime Rib Dip. It was a solid, tasty sandwich, but I felt it was a bit pricey at $17.  Their posted happy hours are Monday to Friday 3pm to 6pm. Several of their sandwiches and appetizers are $3 or $4 their regular prices. Mug beers are $3 and well drinks are $4.   I will be back, likely riding my bike over with friends for a few $1.95 brown bag mystery beers and a few games out in \"The Yard\"",

    "text": "I'd like to start by thanking \"Local First Arizona\" and \"Culinary Dropout\" for throwing a great (and free) grand opening party!   For our appetizer we chose the Burrata which is a mixture of mozzarella and cream. It had a very mild flavor and a texture similar to ricotta, but slightly creamier. It was served with a grilled bread, diced pears, and chopped walnuts then drizzled with a bacon syrup.  I was not overwhelmed with this dish, and would have preferred a healthier serving a pears and more sauce to add additional sweetness.   The entrees for the evening were the pork ribs and trout. The meat on the ribs was plentiful and tender and sure to satisfy the greatest of carnivores. Although, the standout of the dish was the barbecue sauce. It was deliciously spicy and sweet, finger-lickin' good. Barely worth mentioning were the lackluster fries and coleslaw. Both were just passable and definitely expected more considering the price of the dishes.  I have mixed feelings about the trout. It looked rather lonely on the plate, with a dense line of green beans and almonds accompanying it. It was slightly overcooked, with one side being nearly perfect and tender, while the other was slightly crispy and just a bit dry. This being said it was still quite edible and the buttery sauce accented the filet nicely.  We finished the meal with the cinnamon apple brioche and vanilla gelato. The brioche was served in a cool mini cast iron pan. It seemed to be immersed in cinnamon and sugar, and just far too sweet. The gelato was just okay and was one small sad scoop. Not too much flavor or sweetness here, and that may be a good thing. The brioche was definitely begging for a bit of mellow.   Lastly, we enjoyed a couple cocktails as well. I had the El Matador and the Smashed Irishman. While I almost exclusively drink beer, these drinks were excellent and I would happily order them again. Both seemed to have nearly the perfect balance of sweetness, bitterness, and alcohol. My favorite of the two would have to be the El Matador as I am partial to tequila. If the meal were not comped our bill would have been exactly $100 (excluding tax and tip.)  Almost forgot to mention the venue, which may be the most appealing factor of all. It has a massive covered patio with modern decor, trees dispersed throughout, very nice heaters, and an assortment of games which included ping pong, cornhole, foosball, and shuffleboard. I could definitely see myself going back, brown baggin' it (the beer special) and playing some drunken games. Get it!",

They could not have been more accommodating, and everything worked like a well oiled machine.  We brought gifts for everyone, the valet people helped unload.  The bar - restaurant people helped take empty boxes from our section after we unpacked everything, and were super attentive.  The food was on point as always.  Even with a pretty big group,  our waiter remembered the kind of beer I'd ordered. We all had a great time!",

Unfortunately, I feel there is no longer a management presence and the staff is completely allowed to do as they wish. I will no longer visit this location due to lack of hospitality. I used to like the laid back vibe of the staff, but it has turned into a slew of partially impaired \"hipsters\" who feel they are \"too cool\" to stop their banter amongst themselves to help the guests waiting to patiently pay for food and drinks.  I apologize in advance if valet parking and waiting for dinner makes me seem entitled. Like I said before, I previously liked the staff and experience, but recently felt like a number, not a guest. I wish the staff actually cared about my experience as much as I did when I drove there.",

I ordered the prime rib sammie (sandwich) and the wife got the trout plate. It was wonderful. The service was top notch and the food was just as good. Dan even stopped by to say hello and ask about our Easter plans and talked to my kids.

I would say that some of Fox's other Concepts need more time on the drawling board, but Dropout is a judgement free zone of piercings and tattoos and Burts Bee's Beard Wax and skinny jeans.   Where statements of individualities are clash and blur like Saragossa sea of trends.   All ironies forgiven.   But I like it here.   And why not, their menu is an unapologetic assortment of Gutsronomy / Fusion ' esque recipes pulled from other tried and True places not here.   This place has just that right sort of atmosphere that allows you to eat well and socialize with music provided but not to disrupt the luxuries of either.  It's good for families or just a night out with the babysitter. ------ take that however you want to.  :-)  And they have games for drunks. It's like if your frat house decided to open up a restaurant.   And that's not terrible. The path of least resistance has lead to more then a few comfortable seats here.   I give them great credit for that, they are comfortable.   I don't know where this old-is-new trend in restaurants came from--you know, where the sit you in Circa 1940's hardwood, Boarding School, desktop chairs--but if I wanted my ass to go numb, I would've purchased 2 Groupons for that \"Discount Dominatrix\".   . . . Aaand.   And... that's all I have to say about that -- Forrest Gump.",

But if you are under the age of 21 then you can't be in the games area past 6. Which is garbage because little kids come here to play with there parents. There is also a lounge area for you to watch tv. Also for the bathrooms you can walk into whatever gender door. You will see when you get there. Overall it's pretty good and I recommend trying it out for yourselves.",

No way to tell.  So a cool dude who no doubt is a rebel in a leather jacket and ponytail brought us drinks, so I guess he worked there. A different awesome fellow with purple hair and a trilby hat and a cardigan took our order. All the jeans were so tight and torn and so cool I assumed that meant they worked there and/or were in a band.   I'm not sure I was cool enough to eat here. Even the menu was cool and told me the chefs all wore cool earrings.  I seem to recall the mini fondue was alright, but I was too intimidated by how cool and rebellious this place was.  I'm not sure if 'The Yard' is the property of this place, but they were the only restaurant there. It was both too crowded with drunk people to enjoy with kids, but also too family friendly to be good for a drunk party.",

Luckily we found two spots that could accommodate about 15 people. It was a little warm at first, however once the sun was setting it was cooling down and it turned into a very pleasant evening. FOOD! Well, we ended up purchasing the pretzel bites, potato chips, cheese burger, and nachos. No, we didn't eat all of it, huge portions and we shared most of it. All of it was great, servers continued all night to come by and made sure we were taken care of. We all had a great time, food was great, drinks kept on being filled.",

I parked my car using the valet (no other good option) and walked in to locate my group. So many people, tables, games, and noise. Granted, we did come on a Saturday night so it's probably one of their busiest times. We started with their pierogis appetizer which was great. I ordered the \"cheap house salad\" and pretzels and fondue appetizer. I loved those little bites, and the cheese was good even the next day. The salad was okay, I would've preferred a different type of salad but in the same size that I got.   Service was good when we got it, it took a while for our food to come out but the place was packed. The check was easily split and it was nice of our sever to pack our leftovers. I'd consider coming back for breakfast or lunch with a less drunk and noisy atmosphere.",

There is valet parking which is free.   We ordered the nachos, pretzels & fondue, & wings. The nachos weren't  special. It was okay. The pretzels & fondue was good. The wings were different then other wings but it was good.   I ordered the 36 hr ribs and i changed the coleslaw for green beans which is an extra charge. They gave me my order without fries and asparagus instead. But after I told them they brought the fries and green beans. My brother likes his rainbow trout fish. My sister and brother  got the grilled chicken sandwich it was okay cause they only finished half of it. My brother got the prime rib sandwich, it was okay but still hungry a bit after.   We also got dessert but the s'mores one. Not impressed.  Also the bathrooms are interesting there's a women's and a men's and but when u enter the sinks are for both and there's a separate door for the girls.",

The pretzels were not fresh, nor very warm.  Sort of stale and hard.   For dinner, I ordered the steak grilled steak salad.  For $17, I received salad out of a bag with a few onions & carrots and some about 4 ounces of mediocre steak.   Was seriously bad.

It was recommended to my sister, so I wanted to honor her suggestion, and knew we would get good food.   I made a reservation, and when we showed up, despite having available tables, we waited for almost 15 minutes. It is a young, funky space and we had our parents with us. By the time they finally got around to seating us I think we were almost ready to go.  The volume in the restaurant is loud. My Dad had a hard time hearing, which makes conversation difficult.  Our server went out of her way (IMO) to explain a menu item to my mother, who ordered it and then complained about it being too spicy.   The rest of us were very happy with our food. I started us with one of their anti pasta boards, and if I'd known how much help I was going to get with it, I'd have ordered more!  I did the brussel sprouts, asparagus, manchego, prosciutto, and one more cheese. They add the honey and nuts and raisins on the side and we devoured the tray.   For entrees we had:  A french dip and fries Two orders of the steak tacos Meatloaf Fried Chicken  It was all really good. They make good food.   We did order two desserts, The S'mores dessert and the bread pudding.  The S'mores was really good, the bread pudding left something to be desired.   I'd recommend Culinary Dropout as long as you have open minded people in your party. I thought my parents eyes were going to fall out of their heads a few times.",

Soft Pretzels and Provolone Fondue $12: The Fondue isn't super flavorful, but this is a great appetizer for sharing. There's something super comforting about dipping bread in melted cheese.   Bread Pudding French Toast $4 (kids' menu): They were kind enough to let me order a kids' portion of this, which was still plentiful for me since I also had the Fondue. I still couldn't finish because it was extremely sweet. It came with maple syrup, but I didn't even need it because of all the sauce from the apples. The malted vanilla custard was really good, but overall this was too much sugar even for me!   Final thoughts: Although food was just alright, the atmosphere feels spacious and good for groups to hang out. Great service as well, and they offered to split our check by seats even though there was 5 of us.   *****  My Star Ratings:  1 Star - Terrible. Just thinking about it makes me angry.  2 Stars - Meh. Unlikely for me to return.  3 Stars - OK. Open to coming back, but wouldn't go out of my way to.  4 Stars - Yummy! Will definitely return if I haven't already.  5 Stars - AMAZING!!!

I have been busy with two littles the past three years but have stopped in when I could- always great. I'm a certified soft pretzel fanatic and theirs  check every box. Soft, yeasty (that doesn't sound ideal but it is) and salty with a great cheese dip. Their play on a Big Mac is always perfection.  Please never leave me.",

First the beer selection was pretty good and I would rate that a 5 star but then again I like IPAs.  The menu seemed to skew towards standard bar food but did have some different items.  I was torn between the fish and chips and the meat loaf and mashed potatoes.  Staff recommended the fish and chips.  They were good, may a 7 or 8 out of 10 with long John silvers being a 2.  I have had some better and a lot that were worse.  The taste was a 4 out of 5 but I would rate the food a 3 out of 5 because I was looking for something a little different.  But it definitely was a happening place.",

I was seated right away and am very thankful this place was one of few open at 9 pm on a Sunday. The interior is very beautifully decorated with a lot of trendy and modern  aesthetic decorations and furniture. The restaurant also offers a beautiful outdoor seating area with full mister coverage which is a must for Phoenix. Our waiter was attentive and friendly but not annoyingly so.  All in all the food was very delicious and reasonably priced. I had their fried chicken, substituting cole slaw for fries with mash potatoes. I highly recommend this item. The chicken was hot and crispy with a nice honey drizzle that was to die for. It also came with a biscuit which was unfortunately a little cold and uninspiring. They have great cocktail selections and a lot of beers to choose from. I will definitely be coming back.",

The menu had some interesting items on it. I ordered the Korean Style Shortrib Cap. The flavor in the initial bite was quite delicious. It didn't last throughout the entire plate, however.   The portion size was OK for a later evening meal. However, if I were eating Dinner at a normal time of night, I would probably have been hungry a few hours later. (I think I needed just a little more balance with carbs).   Our waiter was quite nice at the initial of the dinner, however he forgot items for the rest of my party. Then he brought items that we didn't order. He seemed distracted, and I never really saw him after he asked how our first taste was.   Overall... mediocre and not really bad, but not worth the hype. And the parking was annoying. I almost got run over while walking to the door... which is in the rear of the building (in a weird back alley) - weird experience.",

Very poor service, food came out cold, my mussels didn't taste right and the server didn't bother to address the issue.   They took way too long to clear the table and get us our check.  And we weren't alone, the table next to us was complaining of the same things.  Just a general lack of concern and care for our experience.  I certainly hope this was just a one off rather than a once great place becoming a victim of its own success.  May give them another chance down the road, but if I do it will be the last one.",

Well, I happen to like chicken curry so I ordered it.    It was quite good.    I asked for chili peppers on the side since I like hot.    It had big pieces of chicken, potatoes, julienne cut green beans, onions, mushrooms and plenty of sauce that could easily be mopped up with the rice.    Definitely would give any Thai restaurant a run for its money.   He had the grilled cheese sliders.     I don't normally like bread, but I saw it was bathed in plenty of butter or ??.    Anyway, it looked good, so I had a couple of bites.    Plenty of flavor to cover the fact that I don't like bread, and just enough cheese and bacon that I MIGHT consider ordering it.    I had a glass of their merlot.    I can't remember which one it was, but it was at the top of the wine list.   I had had the pretzel bites in the past with the cheese.   That is really good if one likes soft pretzels.    Yummm for sure.     We sat away from the crowd, since happy hour was still going on.    It was a bit noisy, but we could have a conversation without having to say \"What??\" or shout.   There is seating on the patio with plenty of misters.    I didn't feel like taking a shower so we sat inside.   Anyway, it was cooler since the temp for the day had been 114.   Would I go again?   Probably if I was on a date.    I don't care for the fact we  have to valet park our cars, but it wasn't my problem, and they do make it especially convenient.",

Had the fried chicken which was not good, no seasoning. Sub the coleslaw for Mac and cheese and tasted like it came from a box, mashed potatoes tasted instant. The biscuit was pretty good. My friend hated her meal the same as mine, sent it back after 2 bites. At the end the waitress packed our food and she didn't end pack all my food, I had one bite of my biscuit and half a piece of chicken on my plate and i ended up paying $25 just for myself.

We went outside to The Yard and I ordered the modified Moscow Mule at the beer garden area.  Modified, I believe meaning, they use lemon juice instead of lime and there was no copper mug, but that was unnecessary as the drink was more than appeasing.

These were late coming to a table, apology was given and we were told they would be taken care of.  The cost was still on our bill.

Frustrating- Making us \"sign in\" by giving them our phone number, which they're already texting to get us to sign up for their mailing list. Frustrating- Over-priced, mediocre food. Frustrating- A server who was more interested in the game than in our order. Frustrating- Waiting all night for our order. Frustrating- Getting our entree completely wrong. Frustrating- Apologizing by buying us a Kiltlifter, then charging us $7 for it. Frustrating- Waiting ten minutes in a disorganized crowd for a valet to let us leave.  If a restaurant that won't let you in or out, won't give you the food you ordered, can't cook decent food, lies to you, and tops it off by spamming you succeeds in CenPho because the \"ambience\" is trendy, then it reflects poorly on all of us here.

    "text": "I had a relative in town a couple of weekends ago so decided to meet up with some other friends and family at the Culinary Dropout on 7th Street on Sunday morning for brunch.  There were 5 of us in all and we are seasoned \"brunchers\" , so we were excited to try it out.  The first warning sign came with my call the day before; I got someone on the phone who was downright rude when I asked about whether I should (or could) make a reservation.  I was apprehensive about the next day and surprised because this is a Fox restaurant and I expect better from them.  We arrived the next morning in different cars and were greeted by the valets, who were really nice.  I stopped in at the Ladies room and found that both doors to the restroom go into the same place.  I'm no prude but it felt awkward to me.  We were shown to an outside high table which proved to be uncomfortable to one of our party due to back problems so we then moved to a regular table but still had hard chairs.  I was eyeing the sofas but was told that they were \"reserved\" for large parties.  Amazingly, those \"large\" parties somehow shrank when the guests began showing up.  The food showed up promptly and was enjoyed by everyone.  I had the biscuits and gravy, my visitor had the breakfast sandwich, and others had more traditional egg dishes.  I had coffee which was decent but had trouble keeping it, and our water glasses, filled.  I suspect the service will get better once the team figures things out.  So, Culinary Dropout, here are my suggestions for getting me (and all the friends who rely on my suggestions), back again:  1.  Central Phoenix is NOT Scottsdale.  There are a ton of great restaurants very close to you who are really service-focused.  This is a crowd who wants a good meal and to be treated well.  When that happens, you get fierce loyalty and repeat business...just ask the Windsor about that.  2.  Focus on doing what you're good at.  You cannot be all things to all people.  There are other restaurants in Central Phoenix who are having the same issue and it is hurting them, in my opinion.  Try to focus on the neighborhood locals; they are the ones who will keep you healthy.  So I didn't want this to sound so harsh but you have little time to \"make it\" in this neck of the woods....I sincerely want this to work for you and the neighborhood.  Until these things improve, I won't be back.  Just sayin'.....",

I mean, if you want to meet well dressed, well groomed, hot looking men, go here.  Culinary Dropout has managed to create an environment where drinking is not the end game. Yes, I did get drunk here. (After I met a lovely guy. But that's an entirely different story.) But there is stuff to do! Lawn games! (Granted, the ping pong tables were dominated by the 8 year old and under crowd, but, still.)   There is ample seating (couches require reservations). However, bar stools fill up super fast. However, with so much real estate you don't feel like you're on top of someone if you don't have your own table. I can't wait to go back.  (4 stars only, as the food was 'feh'. I shared the tuna salad and had to go on a hunting expedition to try and find very much. The pretzel balls were yummy.)",

It was mentioned that they would be adding more AC units and that they would be handling other issues as well. In all honest this is what I call great service, people who are aware of the voice of the customer and I greatly appreciate this which is why I edited my rating to reflect this. Culinary Dropout has definitely earned a second chance!   The service is also very great and they do offer free Valet as well which is always a bonus. The ambiance and the lighting is also great for dates or it can be as casual as hanging out with your friends in shorts during the day in the outdoor area. Definitely a fun place.",

    "text": "Disappointing visit. Not as good as the Scottsdale restaurant. Ordered the pretzels and fondue, 36-hour pork ribs, and bistro steak.  The cheese for the fondue tasted processed. I liked the concept of the appetizer and the plating was fun. It's a great social food. However, the quality was poor.  The bistro steak was OK. I didn't feel that it was a great value. Small quantity and all you get for a side is fries? It looked like a sirloin cut. I would have rather gone to [a popular family steakhouse] and got their 8 oz sirloin meal. It would have been more meat, better quality, tasted better, and more sides for a well-rounded meal. I swapped the fries for green beans and they were served under-cooked. They still had a pretty fibrous texture.  The 36-hour pork was the greatest disappointment. The meat was overcooked. Extremely chewy. I had a hard enough time breaking up the ribs with a knife.That was really sad because we came back specifically for this meal. Last time, at the Scottsdale location, the meat simply fell off the bones. The sauce was still great.  Parking at this location is horrendous. There is no self-parking nearby. The three restaurants share a complimentary valet service, which is a nice perk. If you'd rather park yourself, plan on parking across 7th St in the Basha's lot and walking.  This is just my opinion, but I feel that the meals are overpriced. I think you're paying for the location and atmosphere. Definitely a fun place for a night out. Since there's three restaurants at this location with combined seating, it's a huge and loud crowd. It's a trendy restaurant with an urban feel.   The only compliment I can give for this trip was the service. Our glasses were always full and we were able to pay quick and get the heck out.",

I sampled the shaved prime rib dip sandwich that a friend ordered, it was very nice with perfectly rosey prime rib. I loved my pub burger and fries. Fries were hot, crispy and flavorful and my burger was one of the best I've had. Next time we go to the valley we know where we'll eat.",

    "text": "We would definitely come back and I was lobbying to go back sooner than later since we had such a great time out with our friends (who are also family). Great food, great drink, and a great time!   PARKING:  It is Valet parking only or you need to park across the street. When you come in, they ask for your cell phone number and txt you when your table is ready. they also immediately send you a link to see your position in line on a web page. It was really cool.  WAIT TIME:  On a Saturday night the wait was about 45 min for the six of us. We went out the the giant patio area and walked right up to an empty table. I think they are hard to come by, but we lucked out.  We had a drink or two before being seated.   BAR:  I think the bar part is called, \"The Yard\" and the restaurant is called Culinary Dropout? I didn't pay that close of attention and there was actually a third area that looked like a sushi bar. This place is huge and made up of 3 or 4 distinct areas.   There are games under the giant patio in the Yard, such as ping pong, corn-hole and shuffleboard, but we did not play any. they all looked busy and we were fine just talking.    There is a small bar behind the games, but they only have 3 beers on tap and a few in cans, so we went to the main bar to get more choices...and they do have a TON of choices. you can also get a Brown Bag Special, which is basically they give you a beer like Hamms or Bush in a paper bag. Kind of funny, but I prefer Kilt Lifter, which they have along with a lot of other great beers. A really great thing about this place is the patio area is so big, you can get a drink and don't have to be standing shoulder to shoulder with other people like seems to be the norm at other trendy restaurants.   The crowd ranges from teens to 50+, but certainly most are in the 20's and 30's.  Us, being in our 40's still fit in.  I suppose it would be ok to bring younger children, but there were none there. ...actually, I did see a woman walking a baby around. We also ran into a friend's teenage children, but I do not recall any other.   RESTAURANT:  The restaurant was very nice. They had a live band that sounded great and was not too loud. We all tried each others food and we like it all. We were really impressed at how great the food was.   FOOD:  The Pretzel fondue was to die for. A MUST have!  The meatloaf was better than my mom's!  (Sorry mom.) My wife and I shared the Pastrami Turkey (Turkey with seasonings on the outside like beef pastrami) with coleslaw on a pretzel bun. I would definitely get that again. REALLY good. The mussels were just \"OK\". Not great, but not bad. The bread that came with them was really good.",

That being said, it was very frustrating trying to separate the staff from the customers because they wear their everyday clothing. I also didn't care for my server having his shirt halfway unbuttoned with his chest hair exposed; I don't think they make a hairnet for that. Besides that, the staff was friendly and like I said prior, the food and drinks were good. However, the only reason I'd go back there would be if my friends wanted to go.",

    "text": "I've been here probably a dozen times and have always had a good time but there needs to be clearer signage that tells people you can't bring any food or drink from Barrio Cafe or other places in the Yard into Culinary Dropout. We were sitting at CD at a table of 7 for 4+ hours ordering food and drink and 2 of our party went to Barrio for food not realizing it was totally separate and were scolded repeatedly by CD staff. I won't pretend to understand the dynamics of how each business at the Yard works, but I can say as a regular customer that whatever separations there are are unclear to people walking around and after spending several hours racking up a tab at CD that it seems like nickel and diming and totally poor form to pass that angst onto customers. Figure out a better way than telling customers \"it's a health code violation\" guys, it's totally bush league customer service, especially when the whole concept of the scene is the communal element.",

Started with the prosciutto deviled eggs, which I thought were really good, and the roasted beets, which I thought were too simple and disappointing (I would skip them in the future).  Thought the sweet potato kale salad was really great, with a nice amount of goat cheese that was not overwhelming. I do wish they put more strips of sweet potato in the salad, but overall portion size was good.  The grilled chicken club was delicious. Accompanying fries were not very good. I would substitute a different side in the future.  I thought the drink prices were all pretty high. I tried the tap wine - would definitely skip it in the future. Just tasted... Muddled.  This place gets so packed during the summer. I'm glad I could enjoy it without the crowd. I recommend grabbing a jacket during the cool months and giving this place a try.",

    "text": "Let me walk u through the Culinary Dropout experience from some first timers.  First it is a Sunday night....  We walk in and are told about 20 minute wait...not bad.  They text u when the table is ready, which I loved.  Once we sat this is when everything is downhill.  The server was obviously extremely overwhelmed and busy.  We are understanding people,  so we waited.  First he comes over and says \"I'll just get everyone waters\"....well ok then, guess water it is.  He eventually came back...got our drink order and then off he goes.  We did stop him to order apps...which is a whole story.  After waiting 40 minutes and the people who sat after us got their apps we decided to ask.  Mind you at this time we already have ordered our food.  He forgot the  apps....great!! 4 hungry adults and a starving kid...no food 40 minutes in.  Finally food shows up after complaining about it.  The pretzel fondue was delicious.  The chips and famous onion dip were ok.  But the star was the deviled eggs with prosciutto were a show stopper!!!  Amazing!! I will come back just for those little babies!  1 hour and 7 minutes...FOOD comes!!!  Hmmm...majority was good.  I personally got the turkey pastrami....this burger has a identity crisis.  Majority of pastrami sandwhiches I have had are hot.  This came out with melted cheese on top and looked delicious.  Took one bite and ice cold in the middle.  Seriously ice cold!  Ask the server if it's a hot or cold sandwhich, his response \"half hot and half cold\"  Are you kidding me?!?!?!  At this point I am annoyed!  Husband ordered fish and chips.  Fish was awesome!! Everyone else ordered burgers and there were no complaints.  Overall the food was decent...but service was miserable. The guy tried...but was a epic fail at the end.  Overall the dinner trip was over a hour and a half....not sure that's worth it....",

The menu was interesting yet simple, I had a mule which I absolutely loved! It was called pistol something I don't know I forget but it had bourbon and was top with cab! Never had a mile with red wine but I loved it! For an appetizer we had the pretzels and fondue, which was good however our fondue was not warm at all! For our entrees I had the trout which was absolutely delicious! Flavors were on point, &cooked perfect! I forget what kind of nuts were on it which kind of scared me because I'm not a huge fan, but it actually meshed well with the dish! My friend had the fried chicken with mashed potatoes, he's a very picky eater and was actually quite impressed with his dinner! We totally would of got dessert but we were stuffed! Our server also was quite lovely, don't know his name but he had a pony tail haha. He was very attentive when he wasn't busy, and was very helpful with the menu.! I'll definitely be back!",

Unfortunately, that was the end of our luck. The server stopped by and offered us more time since we had never been there before. Good right? Wrong, he disappeared for over 20 minutes, and only returned after someone at our table flagged him down. We finally ordered our drinks and dinner, and enjoyed the many TV's around the restaurant. About 25 minutes had past and we had not received our drinks. One of my co-workers was about to walk out when the drinks arrived. About a minute later our appetizers and dinner arrived at the same time. I have to admit, I had the Italian Grinder sandwich which was excellent, unfortunately the service ruined the evening. I am sure if the service was better I would have scored at least a 4. Maybe next time???",

Service ultimately was slow but friendly. The pretzel app was very yummy and the dinner was good, sliders.  The place is too big for efficiency or they need to hire problem solvers. If you have time on your hands the food is good, loud and live music too. Only 2 stars for ruining the surprise party.",

Roberto was a fantastic bartender, attentive and remembered everyone's names. He joked with everyone and created a great atmosphere.   I ordered a Moscow Mule, it was strong and delicious. My friend and I also ordered the nachos and soft pretzels and shared them. They're always yummy!   One of my fav local places.",

We ordered the pretzel and fondue for an appetizer which everyone enjoyed. For my meal, I ordered the grilled chicken club. The chicken was flavored really well. It also comes with ham on it. I'm not a huge ham fan but it's a nice addition to a club sandwich in addition to bacon.  Another cool thing is that our back there is a patio where you can play things like ping pong and corn hole. You just have to give an ID to the hostess and it's so easy to get the equipment. It was pretty empty outside when we came on a Thursday afternoon so we were able to play ping pong for a while which was fun.",

I just wish that it had been hot. We also ordered the chips, ribs and perogis which were all scrumptious as well. Our server was very bubbly. My husband said that he felt like he was talking with emojis as he was very exuberant. We would definitely go back! Oh and it has the longest walk to the bathroom that I've ever experienced!

    "text": "I say 4 out of 5 stars. Here's why. It's actually partly my fault for not looking more into it, but it's hecka noisy in here. I came here for my birthday on Friday night and none of us could really hear each other. The music was great though. Which added on to not being able to hear each other. The second reason why I am giving 4 out of 5 is it's really expensive and they don't have a lot of choices. Again my fault. I forgot to do my friends are vegetarians.  I'm an awful friend. So if you're vegetarian, there isn't a lot of choices. I spent $22. I could have easily spent more money. That was on 2 appetizers and my meal. I almost got a drink and/or dessert. But decided against it. The drinks were pretty expensive too. I got the smoked salmon avocado toast. Holy crap it was amazing. Everyone loved their meal. Which is why I still say 4 out of 5. The place is really big and really cute. The service was great too. Just the level of noise became sorta bothersome. The price I was okay with since it was my birthday but I have my friends to think about too. I also got two snacks as appetizers. I got the balsamic asparagus and the deviled eggs. Both were very tasty. I'm glad I came here and got to try. I recommend trying but just forewarning it's a bit more expensive and a bit louder. Expect to just listen to music or have to talk over the noise. I'm still impressed with this place otherwise.",

Within five minutes they were seating new parties, without reservations as our party grew over our original size. Our birthday party was downgraded to picnic tables. Without water. I cleaned. No table service.  We had to go to the bar for food.  we were also presented with a check that wasn't ours - not sure how that happens since we didn't have table service.   I used to love this place.

The antipasti was yummy and fun, we could have kept ordering off it and nibbling all evening. Parking had to be valet but it was very quick and efficient.   Cons: Too loud for having a business meeting. Entrees were slightly better than average.   I would go back with friends and hangout in the couches or play in the game area.",

The Italian Chop Salad was perfect in texture and flavor, and found a perfect balance in the amount of lettuce versus other ingredients.  Then it became the Italian Wedge, which turned it into a labor of love, you had to wrestle with it.  Then they changed it back to a \"Chop\", but changed the ingredients, added corn, and turned it into a bowl full of chopped up slop with barely any lettuce. Just horrible.  Once a place ruins my favorite dish, I don't go back.",

The back is a giant indoor patio with lounge seating near tvs to watch sports and the end is full of games like shuffle board, corn hole, ping pong and fooseball. Real cool vibe in central Phoenix.

If you have to have the live band at that time of the day, maybe on the outside patio would be better.

I ordered the Kale salad - it listed a number of ingredients which the salad did include, but they were incredibly sparse.  The roasted cauliflower was microscopic and I only found about three itty bitty pieces - about 1/4 teaspoon, same with some of the other toppings.  For $13 I would think it could be more generous, I left hungry and feeling a little ripped off, although what little salad I got was still good. The service was fine - I noticed a lot of reviewers complaining about that, but then I went during a slow time.",

    "text": "Took the family out to this one- of- a- kind watering hole and restaurant as part of Valentine's Day treat. Aside from the rustic outside look, the ambiance was less formal but very welcoming and had an open and airy feel to it than the Scottsdale location. Although it's in keeeping with the area that's not upscale i.e. 'Snotts'dale. Everyone seemed to enjoy it and the place was understandably busy. The play area outside with the four ping pong tables, bean bag toss, fooseball and shuffleboard has to be a nice touch. At the time we were one of the few to indulge in the activities but more and more patrons began to venture out and try it. Since I was the one springing for this one however, I noted it was a bit pricey but not over the top. I say that considering the location they could have kept it down a smidge. Seems to me Sam hit the nail on the ear and skimmed the head. I wouldn't say it's out of reach however and would be an easy fix if they addressed a couple of things. They need, with all the help they have, one person assigned to the Patio area for the activities, with nothing other than to help patrons take part in this unique, fun aspect to a nice place. We are a sporstsminded group and took our own ping pong paddles and batted it around before and after the meal for a bit. The other thing is to direct people to try some activity and liven it up with something other than just sit around and chat. Great place for a date, groups(business/private) and sports minded people who are not just foodies but more multi dimensional. I suspect that Sam Fox has a very nice concept here and am inclined to do it again. It may be a good idea if the bartender 'Brittney' or someone as nice as her could periodically announce and promote the outside dining/activity and organize friendly competition that most people are kinda shy about on their own. Draw em out YKWIM! Something like \" Hey for the more adventurous among our guests here, look out at the patio area and see if it appeals to ya. The activity person out there will hook you up......enjoy and please be sure to let us know how you liked it. Thank you again!",

    "text": "I graduated from ASU this week, and when deciding where to take my mom for a celebratory lunch I could think of no place better than Culinary Dropout. Since this restaurant opened, it has quickly become one of my favorite places to dine, drink, relax and entertain.  I wanted to bring my mom (who is visiting from New England) somewhere special, somewhere that wouldn't disappoint and that not only satisfy our stomach's but also our elevated moods. We were escorted promptly to a lovely corner table inside the dining room by one of the beautiful hosts that are always welcoming you in as you enter from the parking lot. We were immediately greeted by our brightly smiling server Regan. She wasted no time charming both me and mother, speaking easily to both of us, as if we were old friends. After explaining our appetizer options, and offering to get us drinks, I remembered a beer I had tried once before and loved. Unfortunately, I couldn't remember the name, after giving her a brief description, she guided me through the drink menu until we found what I was looking for. After taking our drink order, I watched her as she gracefully moved from table to table offering the same smile and genuine friendliness to those seated around us, I was amazed and instantly comforted knowing I had chosen to celebrate at the right place. Throughout our meal, Regan was never absent for more than a couple of minutes, making sure to check in every chance she got, to make sure every second of our stay was absolutely perfect. I commend Culinary Dropout for its outstanding service as well as its delectable food and drink! I can't wait to bring more of my family and friends here, and I encourage you to try this place out if you haven't, it's worth the wait that can accumulate in the evening hours. Trust me.  Even our goodbye was personal and special!",

First of all, we got there about 11:45 (party of 3) and had to wait 15 minutes, the place was not even very full. They 1st said all the 4-tops which surround the bar  (in & out)....about 10 ( which were empty) were reserved. Then after I went back to ask if we could sit there they said they were short staffed! We ended up sitting inside & not one of the 5-4 tops (inside) was ever used?? Don't get this! They definitely need to up their staff! Next thing is that while one person ordered the meatloaf which was a decent portion, another ordered the buttersquash ravioli which had about 8 small ravioli. I don't need extra large portions but felt it was quite lacking for the price (also feel the food is a bit overpriced for lunch). We ordered bread & olive oil which is $2.00, feel this should be complimentary (think the delicious bread & pesto at Olive & Ivy)...it was very good but this is flat out chintzy!  Service was just ok, the server would come then be gone for a long time. A little too loud as well, with concrete floors I had trouble hearing the person across from me.  This place has a ton of potential, cool vibe, lots of space....hopefully they get it together & provide better service!",

The roasted salmon was creamy and delicious. The steak and potatoes were awesome as well. For dessert, we all chowed down on the caramel corn and the monkey bread. YOU HAVE TO TRY THE MONKEY BREAD!!!!! The second time I went there I had the sweet corn cannelloni with grilled chicken on top. The cannelloni is a great vegan option, I just added the grilled chicken for added protein. Oh, and of course we had monkey bread. It's addictive! Everything I've eaten and drank here is great.

I haven't been to the other locations in Scottsdale or Vegas so I'm only speaking for the 7th. Street venue. Everyone engages with you and they all seem to be really into the kind of food & beverages that they're serving. You already know you won't get a conversation about whether they have lox or nova salmon at a chain restaurant, but you can talk that sh*t here with servers who can riff on it with you.  Pretzel bites with fondue are a mainstay. So is a sampling of their cold cuts and some crusty bread with olive oil. They pour sweet balsamic vinegar into the oil so dip it deep, y'all, and hit that spot.  Seared Tuna Salad is my favorite for lunch, followed by the French Dip sammich. I've tried the fried chicken and it wasn't the move for me. First of all, it's got a sweet tasting crust and some Indian or Mexican spices rubbed into it which together make me believe that they batter the chicken in Frosted Flakes and Coriander with a lil chili powder. I'm all for trying stuff, but I think as a Southerner that I am a fried chicken purist who expects savory, not sweet.  Ask for a booth if they have one open. Tell the girl in the red top sitting by the stage who accidentally smacked me as I walked by to call me because she was fine as hell and I would sop her up with a Culinary Dropout biscuit.",

Our waitress was nice. I liked this restaurant overall and have no complaints about the restaurant, but it didn't seem super extraordinary to me, just another restaurant.   Also, I was kind of confused about where to park. There was a sign that said complimentary valet. Seeing as there were no more spaces left on the street to park, we used the valet services. But since it said \"complimentary,\" does that mean you give a tip??? Kind of confusing...And we felt so bad because we had no idea there would be a valet and we had no cash on us for tip. Sorry guys :(",

Plus, the Yard is the best place to segway for an after party.    My biggest problem is that I have not yet tried the restaurants next to Culinary, but the entire place is amazing and a good time.

We had the hummus and pretzels. The hummus was ok with an interesting olive tapenade and the pretzels and cheese fondue were delicious. Definitely a good shareable portion.  For dinner I had the ribs which were highly recommended and delicious. Slightly on the sweeter side but delicious. I must add I ordered a side salad which was similar to a caesar and that was perfect. Often not done well this was a highlight.  The Manhattan was ok and could have used less ice cubes. Overall a great garage dive with good food",

If you've read past reviews, you know my opinion regarding children in drinking establishments. Parents, get a babysitter. It is not appropriate to set your little urchins free on the unsuspecting public while you order pitchers and shots, pretending to be interested when they stop in to tell you what they have been doing. Kid friendly places: Fuddruckers, Chili's. Anyhow, we tried the Yard but were over run by kids set loose, tossing bean bags from the Corn Hole onto our table. I love kids. Not when I am having adult times with alcohol. Sorry, moms and dads, you gave up your ability to be free and drunk when you decided to procreate. There are great babysitters available if you need a night out. But don't set your wild children free on the public. Back to the Drop Out. We found the pretzels to be undercooked, very doughy and did not eat them. We also ordered other items that did not quite measure up (we all agreed). There is just a lot going on here with the multiple areas. The service was not on par with the other location, we had to wave out arms and yell for our check because we were being ignored.",

Surprised with live music. Really cool outdoor area. Last time I had mussels but this time I sampled the delicious soft pretzel rolls with cheese dip and the salmon bruschetta! I have to recommend the Deschutes IPA, very hoppy and tasty. Parking is less convenient than at Tempe, but they do offer complimentary valet parking if you so wish. This is a great Phoenix spot for drinks and some good bar food.",

For starters we got the salami, dulce gorgonzola, and crusty bread.  Salami was OK, shaved thin, not my cup of tea but good.  The cheese, take it slow if you get the gorgonzola, it packs a punch.  In the good way.  Crusty bread was perfectly toasted, nice and crisp with a good center.  Light garlic oil and balsamic on top went well.  My wife got the kale and butternut squash salad.  She said it was wonderful and the one bite of kale she convinced me to eat was not bad.  I got the fried chicken.  I never thought I would find some of the best fried chicken outside of the south.  The outside was a little greasy but when I bit in!!! Great breading and perfect on the inside. Mashed potatoes were mashed potatoes,  in other words, good.  Slaw was light and crisp, thinly sliced, making it one of the few slaws I have not instantly hated.  Service was ok.  The place is super busy.  Nice staff but not super attentive due to the vast amount of people.  It is very loud inside so you may have some communication issues with the server.  Not a place for a quite date",

    "text": "I have previously been to this location on a casual day, was not that impressed at the time. However when I went back and took my children as it seemed more like a kickback family type vibe, I was much more impressed. The staff was above par, and probably my favorite part of the establishment. From the hostesses in the front, to the waitstaff bussers and management, they were all amazingly friendly and accommodating. Whenever someone has been a server or hostess in the past, I think we critique other waitstaff that much more, but also are understanding of issues. That being said, everyone was so welcoming and it made the experience very fun and easy for my children and myself. Some of the menu can use some tweaking, but it's affordable, diverse, and appropriate for the crowd. I will be back. Super chill and great for adults and kiddos. To note, I don't think this place would be appropriate for those people reviewing this who intend to allow their children to run crazy and unsupervised. This is largely an adult establishment, and a few older children if properly supervised, would not be an issue, mine are 11 and 13.",

We ordered the couples 3 course meal for $44.  My buddy ordered the salmon bruchetta, meatloaf, salted caramel custard.  I ordered the salad, ribs, salted caramel custard.  By the time I got thru the salad I was done because I had already ordered nachos as an appetizer we both ended up taking our food home.  Culinary Dropout amazing service.  Now this was our 1st time there & it's amazing 3 restaurants in one Phenomenal idea.  Our next visit will be Little Cleos.",

It probably would have been more fun if I hadn't gone during the summer. It was way too hot. But the hummus and pita bread were good. Drinks were nice and cold. I can't really say much about the service since it was non-existent. Our waitress brought our drinks, took our order and never returned. We had to constantly ask other waitresses for refills. And every waiter/ waitress we asked seemed really annoyed. It was so frustrating. At least come and check up on us. We finally saw our waitress again when she brought our check. Not a single smile or \"have a goodnight.\" I don't know why we still tipped. Oh well.",

    "text": "It's a basic American restaurant, but it's done WELL.   As a mainstay of The Yard, you can opt for the raucous, outside seating. I opted for something a bit more dim. Intimate, even. It's man-cavey with all the sports playing, even if there's no sound. The bar has plenty of space, and is comfortable as well.   Beyond the appetizers (I swear I'll try those pretzels!) it is going to be sandwiches, burgers, and salads all the way down. Nothing really jumped out to me screaming \"try this!\" so I went with their Pub Burger. It was simple, but delicious and filling. I'd grab this again, but not before their salmon avocado toast or something like that. I need something more millennial to keep my Yelp-savvy superpowers, after all.   You can wash anything down with the generous beer selection, or even the cool cocktail menu. La Vida Verde is cool, but probably just because I have a bias toward all things with jalapeno. Others, like \"Between you and Me\" with just vodka and grape juice are just plain lazy.   Overall, I don't think you can really go wrong here. Service is nice, and the menu is capable of pleasing many picky eaters. For some reason, I am very partial to the atmosphere and will definitely be back with a couple friends.",

She helped us manage some lounge spaces to gather our group together and kept us in food and drink the entire time we were there WITH a smile and chatted with us to be sure everyone was happy.

    "text": "Culinary Dropout is one of those places where the food is good, and I could have given it 4 - 4 1/2 stars but the service unfortunately is always a hit or miss.   I always start with their meat and cheese plate which consists of some solid items. Some of the meats and cheeses are the same ones you can find in Arrogant Butcher (and AJs) which are delicious. For the cheese, my favorite is the prarie breeze (cheddar). I love getting the crusty bread with balsamic vinegar, and the prosciutto for the meats. I have had their chicken noodle soup before which I loved.  My friends and I come here often and when we do, our go-to is the house potato chips with onion dip. The onion dip is amazing! My sister likes getting the bbq pork belly nachos, and she likes to have the pork belly on the side. It's not amazing nachos, (The Vig has better nachos to be honest) but it's pretty decent. We have ordered the crispy shrimp caesar salad and it is tasty. The breaded, fried (?) crispy shrimp surprisingly pairs well with the salad.   For entrees, I only ever get one thing - Culinary Dropout masters their fried chicken dish. I order it even when I am at home through Uber Eats or Postmates. The chicken is perfectly crispy with the right level of saltiness. The buttermilk biscuits are so good. I don't get anything else. I've had the meat loaf before which was not worth the $15. My boyfriend has ordered the korean style ribeye which he thought was just okay.",

But, you have to enter through the back parking lot. No entrance on the front or the sides.  Big parking lot but, I can see where it would fill up fast. This place is absolutely huge inside. We choose to sit outside as it is finally cool enough to sit outside now. There was a beautiful huge Patio with massive tables and spaces everywhere. We had just missed the lunch rush so it was really good. The menu is on the small side. But, that is what Gordon Ramsey always says, Do just a few things but, do them really well. I have to admit that everything we got was really good! I mean actually excellent. I was driving so I only had water. My friend had a glass of wine. I got the fish and chips with Cole slaw. The fries were incredible. I do not know what they fry them in.  But, whatever it is it works. Both of us thought the same thing. I had to ask what the fish was, as it was firm and flavorful.        Our server said that it was Rock Fish. Rock on because, it was great. Julie Ordered a Burger with bacon. Not my cup of Tea. But, she thought it was great and ate every last bite. Giving it wonderful praise.  I think we came at a really good time of day. Because, it was not busy and it was peaceful outside. I had not heard great things about this place. However, we thought it was amazing. They only have one type of soup though. But, our server too was also really grand. Very much worth a try if you have not gone before.",

If you are craving something savory, you can't go wrong with either of these options! Also, the portion sizes are super generous. I split each dish with a friend and each half serving easily could have passed for a full portion.  I'm not personally a fan of Culinary Dropout's dinner options. Compared to their brunch options, the dinner choices seem a tad overpriced. However, they do have good happy hour deals and their outdoor games make it a great place to decompress after work.  Try to keep an eye out for events here--last month they had a free series of yoga class from CorePower Yoga. They even gave out free drink tickets just for going to the event!",

    "text": "This location is beautiful! Our service was very quick and accommodating from all aspects.   I'm not really sure if there is regular parking but there is complimentary valet (yay) up front! This restaurant seems to be sharing a building with a couple other restaurants so they all share one hostess stand.. smart!   There are tons of tvs and even games outside to play like ping pong. The inside is super elegant but not formal. We ordered black mussels, side salad, and trout.  The black mussels are delicious and come with bread for dipping. The side salad was surprisingly intricate! I was expecting simple greens with a tomato or something but it was truly all out with tons of veggies. The trout was so soft and juicy. I loved it so much I saved some to eat the next day.  Our server was quick, funny, and accommodating. All out a great experience.",

    "text": "I went to culinary dropout today with a party of eleven for a corporate lunch. I recognize parties of 8 or more can be challenging as I myself was a server for five years but this is why planning and being attentive is important. It started off with us waiting at least 20 minutes for our appetizers. When the appetizers of pretzels and kettle chips finally came (before the drinks did, mind you) it only was delivered to one side of the table and not the other. We then waited at least 45 minutes after we ordered our entrees to have it delivered to the table. When I finally received my chicken, of course it was pink on the inside. I did alert the server and she did order me the salmon dish to go. The funny thing is since it was on the company's tab, I'm unsure if the server just charged us an extra entree and didn't actually remove the initial chicken entree. I just want this experience to be known in hopes that other patrons can have a better experience than I did. Thank you.",

The food was good, but our server was either too busy or not that interested, as it took a long time for our orders to arrive; when they did, the temperatures were cooled just enough that we felt they'd been waiting a bit before being delivered to our table. It's also very loud, which may have led to the waitstaff not hearing the order correctly and thus not bringing the right beverages to a couple members of our party. Having to shout across a small table wasn't what we were looking for.",

    "text": "I have to be honest  I love the idea  They do a good job on letting people have a good time  But sometimes there more to it than just fun   Each Star will be a category   Culture - one star * As mention they do good entertaining people with women, food, drinks and games. It's a social warehouse. But don't come alone. Arizona people are not friendly unless they are getting pay to entertain you or you are in a group of people.   Food - no stars  Starting with my first visit. I was set where ppl play game and hang out it's in the very end of the building - me and my group was told that if we sit there we can't order food - if we want drink we have to go and get the drinks at the bar.  More than once other tables  would get their drinks and food deliver to them  So we didn't get food - on my second visit I had a 12 dollars Italian sandwich w a salad. Very basic with nothing special. Here is the sad part lol on my 3rd and last visit I order the limited quantity Korean steak ribeye  Which was the only item on the menu with no description.  So I gave it shot  And I ask the guy what does it come with and he said \"I don't know\" \"but like most steak\" \"it most come with veggies\"  The stake was presented to me cut in 5 skinny pieces, Korean sauce and not much onions, not much zucchini and sadly bean sprouts. Not only cost nearly 30 dollars. They had the guts to ruin the plate with bean sprouts. My heart was broken.   Drinks - one start * Best old fashion I had so far. Had it 5 times and taste the same. Liquor felt off and poor quality but handle well when mix with the other ingredients.  It was their own way of making it because it was a signature way. I didn't taste sugar or sugar syrup. But I liked it anyways.   Service - no star Unless you are sitting by the bar or table by the bar you are not getting food or drinks  I notice they had a lot people working so I don't know why it was har to get someone to at least get water.  The guys tho I like talking to. He wasn't very knowledgeable about the food  TIP:  Close the restaurant for a day or hours and make every dish so all your emp have a tasting event of all your wines beers and food   Parking - no star I didn't drive but the whole valet parking it's old fashion, waste of time and brain cells   Verdict  Cool place  Not a place to meet someone  Needs better menu but drinks are good  2 starts out of 5",

You have pre or post dinner activities in The Yard, ping pong, foosball, and corn hole.   The food is delicious comfort food. We have went twice, just the two of us and then with friends. Both times we enjoyed the small plates. It was a great way to sample a few dishes. I would highly recommend the green chili cornbread and the prosciutto deviled eggs. I've had both the crispy shrimp caesar salad and the beer battered fish and chips. Both are great, depends whether you are looking for something healthier or to treat yourself.   Also there is often live music, which was also on point.",

Food is funky but nothing super special and you definitely pay for the experience. I had the steak sandwich and it was bomb. Would recommend!  Update after eating here:  - steak sandwich is YUMMY I would eat this as a guilty pleasure lunch all the time if I had the chance.   - potato chips w dip were tasty-  nothing super unique though.   - Cesar salad w shrimp is delish",

Even though we were told we could sit in the area where we were sat, no one came to give us a menu or anything. We finally got up to ask a waitress/hostess who informed us we weren't supposed to be there but if we could clear the table in 45 minutes it would be okay-so we said okay. After 15 minutes no one came to take our order, bring water, anything. We finally got up and left, after wasting 25 minutes hoping someone would help us. It was actually really embarrassing. I just can't believe how rude she was. Really sad since it looked like it could be a fun place. We left and went to Central Kitchen, where the service and food were great.",

Over all the noise of customers was extremely loud music, so loud we could hardly hear each other talk and ended up yelling all evening. I actually woke up with a sore throat this morning. I had heard about Culinary Dropout from quite a few friends, they said it was amazing so I was pretty excited to try it. The menu looked amazing, if took me quite a while to make a selection. I event settled on the turkey pastrami sandwich on the pretzel bun with fries. The food came out pretty quickly, especially considering there were a couple large parties there. The fries were really good, maybe I was just hungry but they were perfectly cooked and had the right amount of salt on them. I could have eaten them all day. The sandwich, which the waiter said was one of the house specialties was good, not exceptional but good. The turkey was a little dry and the bun was crispier than I would have loved. I did enjoy the flavor of the sandwich, but it wasn't anything spectacular. We ended up ordering dessert as well. It was monkey bread with ice cream. It was really good, we split it three ways. I will definitely try the restaurant again, there were other things that were very appealing on the menu, hopefully on a night when it isn't so loud.",

Tried their version of the Moscow mule and it did not disappoint. Had the turkey pastrami on pretzel bread as it was highly recommended by our waiter. Give it an 8/10.",

With that being said, their fish and chips was great and you have to try their buttermilk pie (which they didn't have to comp for us) . Great ambiance, great drinks, great food, and amazing service!

In terms of food, the pork belly BBQ nachos were awesome-great homemade chips, pork, sauces (including a great queso) make this something to share...or not.  I had the M.A.C. burger, their version of a certain famous burger at a large chain, and it really shows the difference in quality of meat and imaginative sauce-making.   Chips and onion dip were a great side.     Atmosphere is a mix between a craft brewery/gastropub/local joint, so it doesn't feel like a chain but has their act together.   When I'm in town next, I'll go again for sure.",

I had made reservations for 14 and I showed up about 15 mins early to get set up but was told by the girls up front I could not be seated until half my party had arrived. I am 8 months pregnant and standing even for 15 mins at this point isn't fun. She then said the bar was open seating and I could hang out there until half my party arrived. Again, I'm very pregnant and \"hanging out at the bar\" is not ideal. Honestly they could have just let me get seated. What saved the rest of my experience here was the DELICIOUS food and the awesome service our server Megan provided. This place is BUSY and she was calm and kept all the orders together and had drinks refilled and was extremely pleasant and accommodating. My only complaint would be the hostesses up front, smile a little more and try to be a little more accommodating because you set the tone for the restaurant. Beyond first arriving the rest of my experience was great again because of the food and our awesome server, I would recommend this place for sure.",

I have tried the salmon (10/10), fish and chips (8/10), ahi salad (5/10) , vegan curry (10/10) and the pretzel and cheese appetizer (8/10). Everything I ordered were extremely delicious. So full of taste and flavor. My favorites were the vegan curry and the salmon. The salmon has just so much taste. In the vegan curry, the sweet potato is the winner. It was the perfect thickness and cooked in a way that absorbed the sauce of the curry. These two dishes were seasoned to perfection. The vegetables that come with both dishes is just amazing and compliment it very well. The prices for culinary drop out is a little on the pricey side but I have to say it is delicious and worth the money. If you're like me and don't get full as fast and is always hungry, this place might not leave you extremely filled. Portions are decent size and to many people it might be perfect or even too much but for me it's not enough.",

The food was not memorable at all. We ordered the pork belly Nachos and expected more than 4 small pieces of pork on the plate. Also the cheese was more of a sauce and the plate was super pork greasy. Not impressed. My husband and I ordered the french dip. Almost no flavor. The french fries were so over salted, we couldn't eat them. My son had a burger and he said it was good but not something unique. My daughter had the pork ribs and she said they were pretty good and fall off the bone good. The waitress was very attentive and nice. The bus boys were almost stalking us to take away plates. We were half way through our nachos and one of the young men tried to take it! The food is ok, but nothing to write home about, sadly. I guess I expected something less run of the mill.",

With an underwhelming selection of brunch items that are average at best take your brunch appetite elsewhere.  The only reason to pick this place is if you are more into the alcohol/beer selection and fun atmosphere than quality of food you are getting.    I tasted a couple meals today ( I ordered the eggs breakfast and tasted a friends frittata).  The eggs breakfast was pretty standard -eggs cooked about right (ordered them medium well and got them more over easy), I subbed sausage for bacon (sausage was not great and I got about one piece if that - see pic) and the potatoes came out of a bag and were awful.  They really need to change the potatoes to homemade hash browns. Who doesn't have wheat toast nowadays?!   The frittata was not any better.  Looks like someone just poured a cup of egg whites in a pan and threw some veggies in it.  It was lacking both creativity and taste.",

If we had more time we would have been all over one of those ping pong tables.  Cons: - Loud atmosphere, but again football Sunday...rowdy crowd ;) - Mandatory valet parking - I have valet parking my car...I have no good reason, just don't like it and don't love being forced to do it   Overall: B+  can't wait to go again and chow on pretzel bites with dip",

We also had to have the pretzels and fondue cheese for an appetizer. It was good but I wish the cheese had maybe some spice, jalapeno maybe?, to it as it was kind of bland. We came at 2pm and it was still really busy but we were able to snag a cornhole game. The only bad things I have to say is our server forgot some things when we asked for them special but it was busy and there were 11 of us with only one server. And I'm guessing he was a manager but another guy that was bringing out food was quite rude when THEY had messed up one of our guests orders.

The reason I give only two stars is, the food is EXTREMELY over priced. I had the trout, which was very good, but came with just the fillet and some green beans. That's it. And it was $19. This is way over priced. And the other reason is the bathrooms. I really HATED the fact that, while I was trying to use the sinks, there were woman walking around behind me. I am not a prude by any stretch, but I was not comfortable with this AT ALL. They should change that. I will not be coming back because of this.",

I have always been a frequent yard goer more for the distinct atmosphere and creative food and drink menu. But lately what has had me coming back nearly every weekend and only sitting at the bar is the bartender Sally! She has taken care of me the last 4 or 5 times I have been in and every single time she has gone above and Beyond the call of duty. Service with a smile is just a bear minimum for her. She is always so pleasant and attentive. At this point she remembers exactly what I drink and exactly how I drink it. She anticipates my needs like she has a 6th Sense! I very very rarely write Yelp reviews but in this case I just had to let it be known that Sally at Culinary Drop is probably the best bartender I have ever experienced and that is not a short list! Keep up the good work and good hiring Culinary!",

It's admittedly VERY crowded during lunch and brunch (on weekends), but so far I've never had to wait more than 20 minutes. So, no complaints there. I do think it's overpriced for both drinks and food. $10 for most cocktails and $15 for a salad? Kinda steep, but it's a Fox Restaurant so not shocking. The food is above average like all his other restaurants, but nothing to write home about. The staff was very friendly, attention and tattooed! Holla! But like I said, it's the actual structure of this place that I really enjoy. Lovely natural light shining into the building, kick back with my $10 beverage and watch people play cornhole. Yeah, I'm good with that.",

We came for lunch around 2pm, the hostess told us we could seat ourselves in the \"yard\" area.  We did.  We watched other tables get service. We finally said something and the server apologized and explained the communal seating area is where we were supposed to sit when seating ourselves. Lunch was ok, but bill for two drinks and two lunches with tip $92 for two.  Our server wanted to leave for the night and we stayed so we cashed out so she could leave, but we were catching up as old friends do and three hours we served ourselves by going to the bartender.  So will say, service great from Chelsea after bartender talked to manager about our situation.  Manager never came to fix anything however.  Needless to say I think we will go else where.  Great concept though.",

The menu was small, but everything sounded great. I ordered an antipasti appetizer and the sweet potato kale salad. The appetizer was soooo small and way overpriced for what we got. The salad, which I imagined being a healthy serving of kale topped with radishes and sweet potato (from the menu description), was tiny and the \"sweet potato\" was literally potato peeling shaving as a garnish. I was not expecting to pay $12 for a bowl of lettuce and a few pieces of kale. The other dish we ordered was the turkey pastrami, which was okay, but the fries were luke warm. After just two beers and the above food items we ended up paying almost $70 for a dinner that could have been made at home for under $20. I say don't waste your time or money going here unless its happy hour and not packed.",

    "text": "Well, let me say that THE YARD is GREAT!!  Also, the pretzel bites and cheese fondue!!  But as far as the other food I've had at the Culinary Dropout, well the chef must have really been a dropout.  Fried Chicken: REALLY greasy. Ribs: taken out of a pre-sealed plastic.  Meatloaf: REALLY dry and just awful! Green beans: Cold and under-cooked.  I just go now for the drinks and pretzels",

The turkey pastrami is my favorite meal, I'm a purest and prefer it without the mustard and coleslaw. The pastrami is delicious and the yummy pretzel bun is always nice and fresh. I always get the pretzel balls and fondue it's so delicious and served piping hot sometimes it has a plastic cheese taste to it, but none the less still pretty good. The house salad is also delicious, the house made dressing is like ranch, but with a lot more kick and flavor not your typical dressing. The shrimp and chicken skewers are delicious as well, but a little pricey, lots of flavor and even a little spicy. They are $6 for 1 skewer and you need about 2-3 for a meal or appetizer to share so it's not very cost efficient. My waiter on our last visit was Boston and he was AHHHMAZING! I've never had bad service, but he went above and beyond for my friends and I. Very attentive and helpful with menu selections, he even helped me choose the wine I couldn't remember getting last time and got it right yummy Prosecco! This review has made me hungry, think I'll be stopping for lunch today!",

    "text": "We went for dinner on a Saturday evening and thought we would go a little early. It's a very popular place and lots of people were already hanging out by 5:30. There are multiple venues in one location and to the novice a little confusing but after we walked around a bit we figured it out. We were seated inside because it was a Phoenix scorcher but it wasn't much cooler inside than in the outside area. The noise level was way over the top with the restaurant at only 50% capacity. It was so difficult to hear each other and the server. The first server dropped off an antipasto order sheet and didn't really explain what it was. It wouldn't matter couldn't hear her anyway. The second server greeted us and gave us great customer service. He acknowledged that it is always loud and gets louder as the evening goes on and noted his ears ring at the end of his shift and his throat is sore from having to yell to be heard. But he noted that there is a live band that shows up later. Really? You can't hear your table mates as it is. We ordered the fried chicken and steak and potatoes. The fried chicken was good but the steak and potatoes were not. It was too fatty and flavorless and the potatoes were burned. The server noticed i didn't like the meal and offered to get me something else. At least I think that was what he was saying. :-) Three drinks and the meal above came out to $80 of disappointment. All in all it's a hipster hangout and a cool scene but not a place for great dining and not a place to catch up with friends or take a date. We probably won't return.",

    "text": "First time at CD this past Saturday. The noise level was ridiculously loud, Came to hear the live music, which was great, but hardly anyone was listening. Food was ok - nothing special. Fish and chips were ok but the fish was a little greasy. Tried the antipasti and paid far too much for what was served. Customer service was fine. The menu could have used more descriptions about the brews and the food. Surprised the crowd is so young given the prices. Won't rush back here anytime soon.",

    "text": "I was so excited to try this place when it opened, as it's right down the street from my house. I didn't get around to eating there until February. I was pretty disappointed :/  For starters, we called WAY ahead to reserve a table for 10, but it wasn't ready when we got there and we had to wait quite a bit. And parking was ridiculous.  The service was APPALLING. The servers were dressed in clothing so \"hipster\" that it was just inappropriate: see-thru shirts, shorts up to the crotch, etc. They did not use trays and would walk glasses back and forth for refills ONE AT A TIME (for a table of 10, that's pretty time consuming.)  We had to flag our waitress down to even order.  TWO glasses came with obvious lipstick on the rim.  For all this, the food was only so-so. And I took my husband's visiting family, as I thought the place would be awesome. Kinda embarrassing.   Will not be returning.",
