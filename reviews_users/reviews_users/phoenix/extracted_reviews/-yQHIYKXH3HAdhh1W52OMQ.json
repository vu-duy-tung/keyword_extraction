I had the bratwurst which is cooked in four peaks kiltlifter beer (my fave beer!!)  with sauerkraut, onions and bacon topped with swiss cheese and sweet delicious bavarian mustard. I asked for their homemade chips which were super good. They also had Four Peaks beer on tap, which is pretty awesome as they're supporting local breweries. The bathrooms are unisex, which was totally different from what I'm used to, but somehow it worked. There's a nifty little pie spot right next door that I'm going to have to try at my next visit. I will be coming back here for sure.",

It's really saying something that one place can appeal equally to a family full of ravenous meat eaters just as much as it can to vegans (we had both at our wedding and both were in love with what the ordered.) Their catering menu is somehow even more interesting than their already robust and dynamic truck menu, and their prices are fantastic for what you get. We ordered their salad, mac & cheese and awesome potato salad as our sides and people almost literally couldn't get enough.   Every time I do business with this place, I come away impressed with how awesome they are. It's a delight to have such a dynamic, interesting and delicious place right in the heart of Phoenix.",

I am not really a hot dog eater (I read The Jungle and haven't been able to eat them since) so I ordered home fries which were delightfully delicate and crispy (it tasted like they were cooked in duck fat) and a breakfast sandwich. Which was also delightful and delicious. The menu had lots of items that catered to my vegetarian friends, and everyone seemed super happy with their orders.   I've been looking for a better brunch spot since I moved downtown and I finally found it! Good drinks, great service, wonderful food. You should go!",

However, this time around I only enjoyed the delectable cans of beer here at Short Leash because we ate elsewhere before stumbling over to this place during First Friday.   I had the Coconut Porter in a can and it blew my hair back. I also tried a yummy Pilsner that they have in a can as well. Their beers on tap or not that adventurous or exciting to me so I opted for can and was very happy. I will return to eat the food there; it smelled and looked amazing as the servers walked the food to the tables behind me.",

A very tasty chicken dog with spicy mustard and lots of sweet relish - just the way I like it!   All dogs are served on naan, a tasty and less bready alternative to a bun! Well done Short Leash.

So, I was really happy to find out they now have a restaurant!  A large group of my friends and I ate here before heading out to enjoy First Friday.  Supporting a local spot who uses the finest locally made hot dogs and sausages is where it's at.    Their fried pickles are certainly worth an order and perfect for sharing with friends.  Another friend ordered the funnel cakes with chive remoulade and capers...they loved it, while I didn't seem to adjust to the taste combo.  Meh.    I had myself a regular Igby.  Cole slaw. BBQ Sauce. Blue Cheese.  And of course the best thing a hot dog could go in...their flat bread.  I'm not sure why I didn't like this one since all I've ever heard about is how delicious their dogs are.  But I was a bit underwhelmed by this one.  Dang!  Somehow the coleslaw was too well...cabbagey, while the BBQ sauce was not tangy enough.  It overpowered the blue cheese too much.  I was too chicken to try the Bear with peanut butter and cracker jacks.  So, I am going for the Devil Dog next time!  Or I'll possibly create my own, but I don't consider myself a hot dog flavor combo connoseiur and would rather rely on Short Leash's expertise.    If you are a fan of their food truck, definitely step in to Sit...Stay.  Or better yet, if you've been waiting to grab a bite...get in there!    P.S. I did have the pleasure of devouring their sausage stuffed green chiles at the Chile Pepper Festival this year and it was totally tasty!",

Are they the best tasting hog dogs I've ever eaten? Well... no when compared to a few places in Chicago but they are the best hot dogs in Phoenix with out a doubt.  Your first step is to find the Short Leash Dog truck.  You can find them at the downtown public market on Friday's and I believe on Saturday's too or look them up on Facebook to see where they are set up.    I recommend the Igby with their spicy beer hot dog ~ very flavorsome sausage grilled to perfection with a topping of coleslaw with crumbled blue cheese and some BBQ sauce.  The combination sounded a bit off when I first read it but it was awesome!  I love the flat bread they use to hold their tasty hot dog creations. I also recommend the Aiko with mango chutney, jalapenos, onions, cilantro and some mayo.  It is also scrumptious but with a little kick!  If you don't like their options you can create your own delectable dog anyway you like it served on their yummy flat bread of course.  They have bottled H2O and soda in bottles. I found the diet black cherry goes well with any hot dog. They are open for breakfast, lunch and dinner at different locations around town.  Look them up on FB, find them and enjoy a creative and delicious bite to eat.",

Our original dinner plan was to order Chinese from China Village & run across the street for a drink at Shady's while we waited.  We lucked out big time!  The parking lot of China Village was full, so we went right to Shady's and were introduced to Short Leash.  All it took was one look at the menu and I knew I would be hooked.  I was tossed up between the Aiko (mango chutney, jalapenos, red onions, fresh cilantro and mayo) or the Lady (chipotle cream cheese, sauteed onions and fried pickles) - but went with the lady.  I have not stopped thinking about the deliciousness of that dog since it touched my lips.    Speaking of fried pickles - I have always loved them, but the fried pickles from Short Leash were hands down the best fried pickles I have ever had.  I need to find out what they put in their batter to give it the spice and crispiness that lasted through the entire meal - no soggy pickles in the end.    So if you're a hotdog fan or even if you're not (they will convert you!) find them on Facebook, track them down in the Valley and get some goodness!!",

    "text": "After hearing I could get a Vegan Hot Dog, I finally made it down to food truck Friday.  Let me tell you the anticipation was killing me. I saw the long line and knew it must be amazing, none of the other trucks had a line like theirs.   I really had my heart set on a Vegan corn dog but was told that unfortunately the Vegan dogs don't stand up to the heat of going into the fryer, it was a sad day.   I opted for a vegan dog with sauerkraut, relish and mustard, and although I was told that the bun/bread wasn't completely vegan as it had trace amount of egg in it, I went ahead and got it anyway.   WOW, one bite and I saw the face of DOG!   This was by far the most sinful experience I've had in a very long time, words cannot describe the magnitude of flavors that were dancing around in my mouth, it was completely euphoric.   Short Leash Dogs are simply amazing, and as I write this, I'm already plotting my next visit and you should too!   P.S.  For all you non-vegans, don't worry, they have a fine selection of meaty wieners just for you.",

I ordered a veggie dog with green chilies and pinto beans but they have a great unique assortment of hot dogs and fixings. The hot dog was wrapped in a sort of pita bread. It was delicious. The service and the experience was great. I highly recommend them!",

Who could ever imagine that mango, cilantro, mayonnaise, jalapenos and a hot dog, served on nan bread, would ever go together?  I'm so thankful that Brad and Kat did, because that concoction is one little slice of heavenly dog.      I actually hired Short Leash to cater a party I had at my house for 70 people and it was the talk of all my friends for months after.   I'm pretty certain that Short Leash saw an increase in visitor's the month after my party from all the guest that were introduced to their marvelous food :)  And, I'll tell you what, the price point was so reasonable (never mind the benefit I gained of not having to cook and clean up).  Brad and Kat are great people who care about the community and support the local-organic trend that is sweeping the nation.   Go catch them for dinner on Wednesday evenings (along with other food trucks) down at the Phoenix Public Market, or at Food Truck Friday's same locale.  You won't regret it!",

They have some unique signature hot dogs that I wasn't brave enough to get. The bear has peanut butter and cracker jacks. One of my friends got it and they said that it was good, minus the cracker jacks. I personally really liked the two dogs I got, but I wouldn't say that they were the best hot dogs that I have ever had. I like hot dogs in a bun, not a pita.

They have a variety of meats to choose from, from veggie to brat to spicy beer dog, and a huge list of unique toppings like mango chutney and chipotle cream cheese. My absolute favorite part is the warm fluffy pita bread that your dog comes on instead of a plan old bun.  If you're a Short Leash newbie, try one of their combos like the Aiko, which Brad recommended I try with the spicy dog for a perfect sweet-and-spicy combination. Or go for their featured Dog of the Day, which today was a Greek-style dog with feta and homemade tzatziki sauce. Yum!",

    "text": "I'll admit...I've always seen the hot dog as the lowest possible form of meat there is. Even as a kid, hearing playground rumors of what was actually in hot dogs struck me with fear and made the hot dog's more attractive cousin...the hamburger...a much more appealing option for stuffing into my gullet. Sure...I'd have a hot dog once a year or so when I was in the mood, or at the occasional baseball game. But for all intents and purposes, the hot dog was dead to me. Now, thanks to Short Leash Dogs my mild disdain of the hot dog has made a miraculous 180, rising from the recesses of my palette like a phoenix from the ashes.   How could a hot dog be so amazing?   Maybe it's the fresh and local ingredients...or the high quality dogs/sausages they use...or maybe it's the Naan bread. Whatever they're doing...they're doing it right, because when you bite into one of their unique dogs, it's like an explosion of flavor that can't even be compared to the type of hot dogs I grew up on.  So far we've tried a few different styles and they've all been uniquely tasty in their own way. My personal favorite is Beer Hot served Lady style...it might just be one of the best things I've ever put in my mouth.  Oh...and if it wasn't enough that their food is orgasmically good, the two owners are some of the nicest people you'll ever meet. Someone with a product this good has no right being so genuine and friendly. Honestly, they could be assholes and their food is good enough that it would probably still sell like hot cakes. When a restaurant (or food truck in this case) has amazing food that is matched with friendly service, it creates an environment you want to keep coming back to. Did I mention the prices are pretty cheap too?  Thank you to Short Leash Dogs I am now craving their hot dogs on a weekly basis, at the very least.  We love this place if you can't tell. If you haven't tried it already...GO NOW. My only hope is that they continue to expand and trek to more places around the valley more often...maybe even open up a brick and mortar location somewhere close to where I live; hey I can dream can't I?  5/5.",

I chose a hot beef dog as my \"dog selection\" here. Overall very good, but I could have done without the mango. Not that the mango was bad just that it seemed a bit too much as it kept falling out of my flat bread!   Always excited for whatever creation I can have next time I go.",

    "text": "I'm always down with hot dogs..................  Decided to come down here to check this place out.  I had read about it on Yelp and it sounded right up my alley.  I grabbed a parking spot about 100 feet away, walked in and took a seat.  I browsed over the menu for a bit and decided to place my order for 2 dogs.  I went with an All Beef \"Lady\" and I went with one of their specialties \"The Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel\". You get your choice of chips or salad so I chose one of each as my sides.   I had water to drink (they hook you up with a huge jug of water on your table...awesome!)  A few minutes later, my food came out.  Here is how everything shook out.........................  Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel ($9.50)-  Um....interesting?  This is more of a sandwich type entree instead of a hot dog per say.  A knife and forker for sure.  I dug in and honestly, was not that impressed.  They pile a huge mound of sauerkraut, bacon, onions and mustard onto their pretzel roll.  Somewhere in there was a bratwurst ;-).  This thing was too jumbled and messy.  The bratwurst was super small....reminded me of a breakfast sausage.  It was just decent.  I did not really like their pretzel roll either.  It was too light and airy and I prefer my pretzel breads to be dense and chewy.  It wasn't horrible, but I would never get it again.    The Lady- ($8.50)-  Winner!  With their regular dogs, you get to choose what kind of tube steak you want.  Regular, All Beef, Bratwurst, Polish, Beer Hot, Veggie or Chicken.  I went with the All Beef.  This \"dog\" (they are served on flat bread...kind of like half naan and half pita...it worked well) came with chipotle cream cheese, fried pickles and sauteed onions.  An odd combo but I'll be damned if it didn't work perfectly.  The dog itself snapped when you bit in, had great flavor and was rather large.  The chipotle cream cheese was damn spicy and it melted down into a sauce like consistency.  The fried pickles were perfect and the onions were plentiful.  The whole combo of flavors worked well.  If I ever come back, I would get this again.  It was a really really good dog.  They give you some homemade potato chips too.  They were pretty darn delicious.  It's a decent sized portion too.  Service was excellent!  The 2 ladies that helped me out were super friendly and all smiles.    3 stars because of two things.  The price was ridiculous.  $18.00 for 2 hot dogs is nuts.  I could go to my favorite hot dog joint, get 3 sausages, a drink and fries for around $16 bucks.  This meal was JUST 2 dogs.  My Andrew Jackson frowned when I told him what he was being exchanged for.  The other reason was that the Bratwurst dog just wasn't impressive.   The \"Lady\" dog on the other hand, was excellent.  If I had just gotten that by itself, I might rate this a star higher.  Cool concept and extremely friendly staff....just too dang expensive for my taste!",

The food is good. If you're a fan of the food truck, you'll love the brick and mortar restaurant.  Our young ones liked the choices on the kids menu. On this visit, one opted for the corn dogs, a pretty filling choice. The other opted for the Frito Pie, messy goodness playfully presented in a Frito chips bag. It was more fun, but not quite as filling. Both were fairly priced at six dollars. The more mature in our group all loved their choices as well, but with the numerous wieners and toppings available, how could you not? Everything under ten bucks. I'm a fan of the Mac Daddy.  I'll confess to not really liking hot dogs. Odd, I know. A childhood farm experience in the Midwest involving older cousins and the making of sausage. No more need be said. Still, Short Leash has won me over. I enjoyed my Mac Daddy beef wiener and the pop it made as I bit into it. Perfectly prepared with the juices preserved.

Playing off the \"dog\" theme, patrons actually encouraged to send in photos of their furry friends in sponsorship of specials, it was just after 8am that I approached the small Vernon Avenue kiosk housing Rollover Doughnuts and greeted by a pair of friendly young woman I was sadly informed that the savory oft-cited \"Bear\" was no longer available due to 'lack of interest,' a half-dozen other options selected at the $11 discounted price.  Truly a \"cheaper by the dozen\" - or half dozen - space, doughnuts usually billed $2.00-$2.50 each, it was at a stone table nearby that seating was found for indulgence, items spread out and the New Year special \"Champagne\" offering glimpses of brilliance as the springy brioche pocketed rich cream custard beneath vibrant Strawberry glaze.  Attempting to taste in mild to bold fashion, a light ring of citrus topped in chopped pistachios strongly resembling a cannoli next to grace my tongue, it was unfortunate that the fritter was anything but a typical crunchy apple experience, the texture closer to a bready pull-apart without a lot of flavor beyond cinnamon to be found.  Back on track with Maple Bacon, the nearly ubiquitous modern-classic better than most as a result of natural tasting frosting and a hint of woody smoke, the best bite of the morning was next found in Chocolate Chip Cookie Dough, both the base and frosting studded with dark chocolate that helped to anchor Salty Brown Butter Glaze.  Impressed to this point it was with \"Coffee Cake\" that the Rollover Doughnut tasting did end and although rarely a 'fan' of filled options the execution was every bit on-point with the fruity version prior, custard the flavor of lightly sweetened espresso quickly flooding the palate and dissipating slowly to nutty notes amidst subtle vanilla bean.",

Tried a lot of them, but the orange pistachio one was my favorite! The worker was extremely friendly and helpful. There was a little cute side room where you can enjoy your coffee and donuts. It has the cutest decor and was filled with a few board games to play and books to read while you were there.   If I ever get the chance to come back to Arizona, I will definitely be returning here.",

When I got to the restaurant I found out they had pretzel buns and asked about that too. The cashier was really nice and went and asked about that too. I ended up ordering a veggie dog in a pretzel bun with sauerkraut and mustard. The whole thing was so good especially because I was so hungry that day. It was one of the best pretzel buns I've ever had. The cashier was a little confused when I first asked about vegan options but she was really nice and kept checking things for me. Would come here again. It's right by some bars downtown and by a bunch of murals. They have a donut place attached. I didn't ask but I don't think they have vegan options. It's an open space with indoor and outdoor seating. I liked the decor, it was greyish-black with art work and signage. They also had a foosball table  and we played a game. Fun experience, really like this place.",

High demand is always a good sign. The Thai coconut custard donut looked intriguing. We quickly inhaled the sweet, yeasty bit of gluttony and thoroughly enjoyed it.   We were tempted to patronize the establishment because of the unique rose cognac latte we perused on yelp.  Unfortunately, to our immense disappointment we were told that they were out of the sugar to make the drink. We were cheerfully offered a not so exciting vanilla latte as an alternative but opted for the cold  brew instead.",

We asked, \"What's in your veggie chili?\"   The response, \"I don't actually know. Beans\"   Ok dude. Then there was confusion asking if they used the veggie dog in the chili (my bad, you don't know yeah) and the dude thought we were ordering a veggie dog.   He answered the phone twice while taking our order.   If you have a kids menu, and high chairs, a changing table in at least one restroom would be appreciated. Not excited to change my kid on the floor next to a urinal that is filthy and caked in urine.   The food: the only saving grace. I got the Chicago dog with spicy beer option. It was really good. Significant other and baby boy got the veggie chili fries (which we had mass confusion over when delivered- thankfully the only competent employee in this place, the cook, came out to assure us we got what we wanted) and the Mac n cheese (which is really good)   I ordered an iced tea, but realized after I left, I never even got the iced tea I paid for. Probably because I was so involved with the cluelessness of the staff. He did carry the high chair outside for us (which was the one helpful thing he did during our experience)   Was really craving this place today but after this visit I think I've gotten my fill for quite a while.

I don't like the lack of service though, you're constantly ignored and always having to chase and flag someone down. The staff are friendly when they finally can be bothered with a customer. Forks are the only thing available, no other flatware, and they get dumped in a can on the table or counter where everyone can lick, handle, sneeze on, and generally get dirty past well handled dirty menus constantly rubbing on them. Regardless of someone thinking they are just so clever to ignore traditional restaurant standard health practices or just not caring at all about cleanliness, it's disgusting to just have forks stored like that at the tables and bar counter. Not sure how that got a pass in health inspection. Napkins are also just stuffed in the can. If you can get past your fork being used as a butt scratcher just before you use it to eat and have nine dollars burning a craving hole in your pocket, you'll get a delicious hot dog here.",

I had heard a lot of good things about this place and figured I'd give it a try...despite the LONGEST line ever.  As we approached the menu I felt this wave of anxiety wash over me.  I mean how many different toppings can you put on a hot dog.  Wait? Did I read that correctly? Cracker Jacks? Peanut Butter? BACON? GOUDA...on the same hot dog?  Um...yummy???    Ok. so I wasn't as adventurous as my best friend...I opted for the spicy beer dog with sauerkraut, spicy mustard, cilantro, jalapenos, tomatoes, and smoked gouda.  Wrapped in not a typical hot dog bun, but in this soft pita type bread.  I was in love.    My best friend went for it though...she ordered THE BEAR!  Beef dog, peanut butter, bbq sauce, smoked gouda, cracker jacks....I took a bite and instantly had weiner envy!  (hehehe)  The peanut butter gave it this asian/thai/korean type of flavor.  It was delicious! Next time I'm going back to have the mango chutney/cilantro dog.    Ok...I know I keep rambling and this review is poorly written, but as I write I keep remembering all of the goodness that goes on in this little food truck.  As for the weiners...(the following has a rating of PG-13 due to some innuendos and connotations that could be inferred) they have that casing that as soon as you put the weiner in your mouth...well, it kinda snaps/pops!  Then all the flavorful goodness just begins to take over your tastebuds and well, I can't speak for everyone here, but I got this warm and fuzzy feeling searing through my body!  I had to take a moment to savor this feeling as I wasn't sure when I would experience it again!  Woooo-sahhhhhh.  This was like being on a date with Shemar Moore...I just wanted to take that dog in my hand and say \"Hey baby girl...how youuuu doin?\"  Ok so I mixed a little Joey Tribiani in there as well!  Anyway...the dude at the window was super friendly and very patient with my inability to just make a damn decision!  The line moved fairly quickly and the wait for the food wasn't long at all!    Oh did I mention that their corn dogs look like a giant fried piece of heaven?  There's always next time....",

Just looking over the menu takes a while because everything looks good. We started with corn dog bites which were good and then we ordered dogs. I had the bear which was different but in a good way. The house made chips are good too. Everyone loved their food. The brat stuffed pretzel and regular pretzel dogs were good too. The real star at this place are the donuts! We tried a strawberry cheesecake, a root beer float and a chocolate chip cookie dough. All were excellent and I would come here just for the donuts. Add in the uno cards at the table to keep kids (or adults) occupied and the great beer list and you get a great joint I can't wait to go to again.",

Our appetizer  never showed up and when we asked they said it would take 20 minutes because they were chaining their oil... in the middle of dinner service?

Therefore, the toppings and bun of a veggie dog must be really spectacular to make it an enjoyable. Short Leash succeeds at this with all their creative combos and delicious naan. I've tried a few at their truck, but I'll always be partial to the first one I ever tried, the Igby. The spicy barbecue sauce, coleslaw and blue cheese makes my mouth water.  At the restaurant, I was finally able to try the green tomato stack, something I've been seeing on instagram all summer. It definitely lived up to the hype, and I'm sure the bacon I left off takes it over the top. I'm glad they had some Dos Cabezas wine on tap, but it would be great to see their 4 item wine selection expanded.  Sit...Stay is a great option for downtown dining. If they could somehow come up with a tasty, housemade veggie dog, I'd give them a million glittery stars.",

Their food is unique, to say the least, and is definitely a niche. They're located right on Roosevelt Row in downtown Phoenix so given the amount of regular foot traffic it is tricky to stay in business there.  On our visit I was stunned how silly and goofy the waitress was. Maybe it was just me and the long trip we just returned from but it was refreshing that she was just as interested in chatting with my girlfriend and I as she was in taking our orders.  Honestly we ended up getting the appetizer, dinner, and dessert for that very reason.  Service is big for me, having worked in the food service industry myself in the past. So I can't speak highly enough about great service.  Again it's a unique joint but worth the drive into downtown and certainly worth the price.",

I don't have to repeat things 50 times and the service is much quicker than I expected.  I ordered the Lady dog which has onions, fried pickles and chipotle cream cheese sauce. I got it on an all beef dog. I added mushrooms to it for something extra.  When I got it, it was piping hot in bread that I think is naan, and if not, is something pretty damn close. It was so good, I didn't want it to end. I didn't want to admit that I had an empty dish in front of me. I wanted to get in line and buy another. But it was enough for a complete meal and I knew I had no one to roll me into my house even if I managed to make it to my car.  It was piping hot, which was good but that combined with the bread made it a little hard to hold. I'm not complaining though. Next time I'll just have to knife and fork it, which is completely fine by me.   Additionally they have pepsi in a bottle, which is hard core. I'm a fan!",

I had wanted to get the Oliver (Reuben-esque), but when I heard there was no bread I opted for the Aiko which has red onion, jalapeno, mango... It was good And spicy! I also picked up a Miko for the roommate which looked tasty and she didn't seem to have any complaints. Dogs are $5. I think Maui dog is a better deal for what you get.

They always have the longest line too. My coworkers and I try to make it out to the food trucks every 3rd Thursday in front of the Whole Foods off of Raintree Dr. They always get Short Leash and after seeing them order the corn dogs every time, I caved and had to see what all the hype was about. Let me tell you, their jalapeno and cheese corn dog is the best I've ever had. I was a little skeptical because I'm not a huge spicy food person but I was told that it was pretty mild (which it is). The batter definitely made it, it was nice and crunchy (not soggy like your usual corn dog). I may have to try one of their dogs next time but the corn dog was so good I don't know if I can stray away. If you do decide to make a custom dog, you can put on as many toppings as you want without an extra charge. I think that's pretty neat since places usually charge you for every little extra thing.",

It feels just like you would expect the inside of the food truck to feel. The owners have clearly put their stamp on every inch of this establishment, and it shows. I had the Sunny and my husband tried their pulled-pork sandwich special. I was not blown away with the bread to topping ratio. It was a bit too much bread for my liking. However, it won't stop me from coming back in the future and supporting this awesome local business!",

A trip to the Urban Grocery store for some wine tasting yesterday provided a perfect opportunity.  There were four specialty dogs up for grabs, but after subbing out my blue cheese for cheddar, I decided to go completely original and ditch the coleslaw for pinto beans.  I went with a beer hot based on the guy's recommendation.    What can I say?  This dog was magical.  I think I loved the bun best.  I don't know what it was, but it was soft and fluffy and held the dog and fixings well.  Beans, of course, went tremendously with the slightly spicy dog.  And all for just $5.  Phoenix, you need to try this place.",

I have to admit I overlooked it many a time at Food Truck Fridays, having a hard time imagining paying $6 for a hotdog. But the people kept lining up, and I started seeing these glorious creations and figured I'd take the plunge. The Igby is my absolute favorite. I always get it with the spicy beer wiener, and it includes coleslaw, blue cheese, and bbq sauce! YUM! It never gets old! I keep telling myself I'm going to get something else, but I'm hooked! I am so excited to get down and try their brick and mortar place! Short Leash Dogs are worth every penny!",

The other was spicy filled with icky cheese and hard to chew.  $8.69 with tax....should of ordered the pretzel dog which my daughter enjoyed for about the same cost.

He found his to be just the right crunch and mine tasted so authentic I was almost concerned it was meaty.  We also got a starter of fried pickle chips, with two tasty dips.  Fried pickles were very sweet so beware if you are not a sweet pickle fan.  The ambiance was very hipster and the staff were super friendly.    We also bought donuts per the recommendations and yet to eat them- but you can't go wrong with a pistachio orange cream cake donut!  Mmmmm....",

It's counter service, so you order and sit- with plenty of tables inside and out to pick from.   As for the food, it was sooo good. I don't eat meat, but my boyfriend does. I got a build-your-own veggie dog, with mayo, relish, onion, ketchup and mustard. It was exactly what I was craving.  My boyfriend got the Moki (I believe) with all beef dog, which is similar to a Sonoran dog. He absolutely loved it.  They use naan instead of traditional buns, and I will say it's a little excessive as the naan is so much bigger than the hotdogs. It was very delicious, though, and well worth the left over bits of bread.",

The ingredients were tasty and clean. There was no oil, grease or butter overkill. The naan was warm and soft. The sausage was good too.   Their drink selection is far better than I would of expected. Regional beers in the high numbers and who can say to no to a big red?   Dessert: I need Anne Robinson to tell them that this is their weakest link. The strawberry cheesecake doughnut tasted imported..imported from Tim Horton's that is. Bad Bad Bad.  Service was clean just like their dogs.  I love businesses that can put a twist on things the way that Short Leash has. A worthy stop for anyone to make. And if you're one of those people that skips dessert, for once I won't consider you stingy.",

It's especially easy to overlook a place where you had special memories and that place is gone. It's also easy to forget about a location where you may have had a lackluster experience. The Melrose district is not very forgiving. LET ME TELL YOU, YOU ARE MISSING OUT IF YOU HAVEN'T BEEN HERE! This place is doing things with food I didn't even know that I didn't even know about. Everything I've had on my now 4th visit has been phenomenal and all in a cozy, non-pretentious little restaurant. I don't believe they're hurting for business but the experiences I've had lead me to believe they should be packed with a line out the door if people really knew about the food here. Go get some.",

I ordered bakers dozen($21) which with fees set me back 26 bucks. Not a problem, these were supposed to be some pretty amazing hipster donuts.  I have 3 lids 11, 9 and 4. Once a week they get to indulge in donuts, they were super excited to get 2 boxes of donuts to choose from.  The donuts are huge! We decided it would be best to cut the donuts in pieces so they can try all or most of the ones they wanted.  I took one bite and it was cold, hard and had zero flavor. I didn't say anything out loud so as to not ruin the experience for my kids, my 4 year old tasted 1 put it down tasted 2 more and didn't finish any of the pieces,  turns to me and says \" mooom, why did you get these gross donuts?\" She tried almost all of them and did not like one of them. The 14, 11 and 9 year old took bites of a few but tossed them in the trash and decided to eat some left over brownies that were made 2 days earlier.   I stopped trying after donut 4, since they didnt seem to be getting any better.  In a house of 9 people, all ready to eat donuts with thier coffe or tea I came back to california with 3 whole donuts and 1/2's or 1/4's of all the rest, majority of them went into the trash.  These donuts came home to my mom who is a very non compliant diabetic who gorges on donuts most of the week and she tried one and said \"why did you bring these home, are they for the dog?\"  Based on the cold, hard, stale tasting donuts I received I wouldn't recommend or return to this donut spot.",

    "text": "While visiting the metropolitan Phoenix area I decided to post a message on Yelp talk to enlist the assistance of local Yelpers in helping me locate and identify places to pick up some hot dogs during my stay. One of the first places suggested was \"Short Leash\" which apparently has a much longer title of \"Short Leash Dogs Sit.. Stay Restaurant\". A day later I was off in search of this eatery and further more on the hunt for a good hot dog.  After driving past this place several times I eventually spotted the food truck associated with the restaurant on the outside and realized I was there. There wasn't any immediately noticeable signage from Roosevelt street indicating that this was the right place which threw me for a bit of a loop. There is a door to enter from the side near where the truck was parked. I walked in, verified I was at the right place and got a menu.   After looking over the various hot dog options, all around 8.50 to 9.50 I asked for a recommendation from the lady there and settled on the \"Devil Dog\". I had an option to try it with different types of sausages and went with the all beef hot dog. One interesting note about this place is that it's a waiter/waitress style dining establishment rather than a typical order at a counter and grab your food when it's ready hot dog joint. This place also seems very bar oriented, but because I both don't drink, and it was around 10:30 AM, I stuck with water to compliment my meal. With the Devil Dog, I was offered a choice of chips or salad. Being a straight male I went with the chips.  I snapped a few pictures of the inside while waiting for my food, and in under five minutes the \"Devil Dog\" had arrived. It came wrapped in paper with a toothpick with a pickle on it, the chips being off to the side. I dug into the chips first. These were kettle style chips that were hard but tasty. After eating a few I unwrapped the hot dog from it's paper prison. The hot dog was wrapped in a tortilla, it was a long hot dog that was skinless. The Devil Dog had a red peppers, green peppers, cheese, onions and some seasoning that I can't immediately identify. This tasted very Southwestern and was quite good.  Unfortunately, the tortilla wasn't quite up to the task of holding all the peppers and other ingredients on the hot dog as much of it slopped off, I scooped up some of the remaining peppers with chips.  Overall I found this to be an excellent and non-traditional hot dog. It was a bit on the pricey side but was well worth the money. I was both impressed with and enjoyed my trip to Short Leash and would recommend it. I'm going to give this place a full five star review. Thank you Phoenix area Yelpers for recommending this place.",

    "text": "To say that I love Short Leash is an understatement. In fact, they will be catering my wedding this November because I want to share the wonderfulness that is Short Leash with all my family and friends.  But enough about me, what you really want to know is why you should eat here:  1) I have never had a dish that I didn't like from Short Leash! It's hard to narrow it down to few favorites, but I definitely recommend the Aiko (add Sriracha if you like spicy), Moki, and Devil Dog. And definitely get the chips for your side. They are homemade and delicious! The fried pickles are also a great choice if you're looking to start with an appetizer.  If you happen to be here for dinner,  get the bacon-wrapped cheddar brats since they only serve it after 5 p.m. and also because it's amazing.  2) Not only are the toppings unique and interesting, but there is enough variety to satisfy everyone in a group. I have vegetarian friends that love Short Leash, and if you happen to have friends who eat gluten free, they can leave happy too.  3) You can definitely taste the freshness of your ingredients, and I love that everything comes from local vendors.  4) The staff at Short Leash are always super nice and welcoming, especially the owners Brad and Kat.   5) Booze! They have a great selection of craft beers and they also have local AZ wines on tap. The truck was great on its own, but now that I can have a beer with my hot dog, it's just that much better.  6) Brunch! You might be wondering how a hot dog could possibly taste good at breakfast. I'm not quiet sure either, but Short Leash has found the secret, and it is damn delicious.  At this point, I don't know why you are still reading this and not at Short Leash!",

    "text": "I've always loved Short Leash Dogs, so Sit... Stay is just more of a good thing. I have to say that they found a great location for their bricks and mortar restaurant. And the ambience is clean yet eclectic with lots of clever little touches... like the fire hydrants on the outside of the bathroom doors.  The beer selection adds to the already stellar fare (who doesn't like a beer with their hot dog?) and is appropriately focused on craft beer and local breweries.  As for the food, I've raved in the past about their signature dogs served in flatbreads... but now I've found a new favorite.  The beer hot sausage done up as the Bear is amazing.  Imagine smoked gouda, peanut butter, BBQ sauce, bacon and caramel corn all together with a spicy sausage, and you have the makings of a gourmet classic.  I can't seem to order anything else when I visit.   Sidenote: I tried the currywurst and was a bit disappointed. Maybe I'm overly critical having grown up in Germany, but the curry ketchup on this dog (while seemingly house-made) lacks the sweet and spicy punch that defines the True German street food classic.  The corn pups are also a great starter. I like that they seem to include a mixture of the traditional hot dog and Schneider's jalapeno cheese sausage in the corn pups.  It makes each one a little bit of a surprise. If they really want to elevate this dish (even though it's already great), they should consider sourcing the jalapeno cheese brats from Von Hanson's in the East Valley. If you read my review on Von Hanson's, you will find that I have an undying love for this particular sausage.  I'll sit... and I'll stay. As long as I get my fill here on the legit dogs and beer!",

Short Leash is a food truck that offers gourmet hot dogs, sausages, and brats all from a local vendor - Schreiner's Sausages. They can be found where most food trucks convene around town, but I enjoy them every third Thursday of every month at Whole Foods Raintree. They have 5 regular \"combos\", a weekly special, and build your own. The build your own is rather daunting, as there are so many toppings. I love that they come on Naan bread instead of hot dog buns. (The Naan bread is super soft, so you know it's fresh.) They also have corn dogs for the kids or young at heart. (They are delish.)   The line can be long, but the actual service is quick and friendly. Also, a long line indicates how good the food is! And let me tell you, it's good! I've had a brat, an Italian sausage, and the \"adult\" corn dog (jalapenos and cheddar). My friend had the veggie dog and said it was delicious. I would definitely recommend this place and look forward to trying everything on the menu!",

First let me say, these are no way even close to what a Chicago dog is. I'm not sure if anyone here actually has had a real Chicago hotdog, because what they are serving certainly isn't it. Almost $20 for my \"Chicago dog\" and the dog my date got. As another review has written on here, I can't think of anywhere in Chicago that charges that for 2 hotdogs. The only reason they are even getting 2 stars is because the pita bread was great, maybe they can start making gyros, and the beef hotdog was good. Besides that, unless you want to be overcharged for hipster style, so called hotdogs, just keep walking and save your money",

The same popular dogs are available, but the expanded menu is just as good!  On the most recent visit, I had the Fried Green Tomato stack.  As you might guess, it is a stack of fried green tomatoes, with avocados in between each tomato layer and sitting upon a salad of greens, corn, bacon, and possibly some kind of nut.  The whole thing is drizzled with a mayo based dressing.  OH my gosh it was good.  I washed it down with an ice cold coke from a bottle, and supplemented with a couple bites sneaked from my husband's Bear dog on naan.  The atmosphere is active and busy, and a little hipster.  Everyone is super friendly and laid back.  Apparently there's pie next door?  We'll have to try that next time!",

    "text": "Iv'e been here a few times now, sampled a handful of things off the menu and still don't want to come back. The place just isn't for me.   My first experience was a takeout order. My friend ordered the bear and the corndog bites. The bites were delicious! The bear was weird. Peanut butter and hot dog was just too odd of a combo for me. And I should have realized then what I was getting into eating a hotdog on a piece of naan bread.   My second try was on July 4th - hot dog day pretty much. They were out of the pretzel buns - bummer because that eliminated my two top choices. Ordered a build your own with all beef hot dog, ketchup, mustard, mayo, relish. WAY too many condiments and way too much bread. I get they're trying to be original with the naan instead of buns, but the dog was sliding out with every bite, and the condiments were spilling out the back. The dog had good flavor but I stopped eating because it was seriously messy. The beer was great, but it didn't save the night.   Third try. Finally got tot try the pretzel bun with bratwurst and sauerkraut. Huge letdown. Again way too much bread. The pretzel bun was huge and not what I was expecting. The bratwurst was tiny! And dry, and not very flavorful at all. The only flavor I could taste was the kraut. It was such a disappointment. The only upside was the coleslaw. I thought it tasted fresh and light. You could still taste the cabbage, but it also had enough mayo/creaminess to it.   Overall, I will not be back again. I just haven't had anything that would REALLY bring me back. Nothing I can't find at other places - except naan bread, and I think I'll just save that for Indian food. You guys can have Short Leash, I'll just buy all the ingredients from the store and make my own the next time I'm having a hotdog craving.",

So awesome, I can't imagine better street food, and I can't wait to try the one with cream cheese and fried pickles.

You can even chose the type of wiener you're in the mood for...regular, beef, beer hot and brats.  And the flatbread instead of a bun is just the right combination to let you know you're having something special.    Igby is my favorite.  Well, honestly, it's the only one I've had because I like it so much I order it every time.  I'm planning on trying the Moki next and then maybe create my own.  After a couple more Igbys, that is.

I really liked mine and the jalapeno cheese stuffed corn dog bites were my favorite. I almost wish that the app only included these and not the plain hot dog filled bites. Luckily for me I think they know this and I think only 2 out of the 6 were the regular bites. We didn't have a beer this time and I spent quite a bit of time regretting my decision because they had such a stellar selection. Great local and not so local craft beers are available. Must drink next time! Also- I miss the fried pickles and the lady hot dog I tried on a prior taste at the truck, so I will have to visit more often to work my way through the menu! Aw, shucks.",

When we got here the guy asked us if we minded sitting \"community style\" which is a table that seats 4 and then we sit shoulder-to-shoulder with two other strangers like on the subway. That's totally weird but okay. I got a Moki dog and the dog itself was just a normal boiled-in-water hot dog. They took some barely cooked naan and some shredded cheese and beans and rolled them together and that was what I got for $8. I can make that at my house in a few minutes without much effort. Wife got a pig in a blanket that was a deep fried kielbasa that tasted like it was heavily rolled in sage. We didn't even finish that. Fried pickles were awesome. Our tab was the best joke of the night-$30 for two hot dogs and some fried pickles and a \"special\" root beer. They ran out of the good kind so he brought me a bottle of IBC and hoped I wouldn't notice the difference.  If you're a hipster looking for a good atmosphere with other androgynous and edgy hipsters then this is your spot. You can wash your hot dog down with a $7 small coffee from Luxe a few blocks away and then go home and wonder where all your money goes. I'm poor and not cool so $30 for two hot dogs and a root beer and fried pickles was not a good value in my opinion. If the food was good then I wouldn't worry about it but the food here is nothing special. If you want a good hot dog go to the new El Guero Canelo in Phoenix or Morenos. They have Sonoran dogs for $2.50 each that taste amazing! Even Portillos will give you a HUGE meal for $30.",

I got the Chicago dog with a bratwurst and my dad got the Devil dog with a bratwurst and we both agreed that they were the best hot dogs we've ever had. (And we have had many ballpark dogs to compare them to!) We also shared an order of jalapeno poppers but we were too full to finish. They were the best jalapeno poppers I'd ever had and completely different than the traditional method. Instead of feeling like a deep fried chunk of cream cheese they tasted fresh. They slice a jalapeno in half fill it with smoked gouda and put a light batter on top of the cheese. I don't ever want jalapeno poppers a different way. We also saw a customer order the most glorious cinnamon roll and if we had any room left we would have ordered one to go! Check it out!",

It was sweet and in combination with the cheese the slider just melted in my mouth. When I think of sliders I think of small portions, but this one was rich and filling. I highly recommend Short Leash Dogs. I can't wait to try their other menu items.",

When my boyfriend and I got to Rollover for the first time, we were at first very pleased: the building is super cute, the separate \"lobby\" (study/table room) is well-decorated and clean. But when we got up to the main building to order....  There was a huge swarm of tiny flies in the corner of the pastry case. RIGHT where all of the doughnuts were sitting. A few flies were buzzing around and landing on the doughnuts, but most of them were crawling over one another in the corner. I asked the cashier if there were any doughnuts that hadn't been sitting there all day, and he said with a very bored expression, \"Nope, that's all we have.\" Ummm, no. My boyfriend and I left.  Like I said, I really wanted to like Rollover....but that's absolutely disgusting. Isn't that a health code violation?",

For those that are hot dog traditionalists, this might not be a good hot dog for you, since they wrap the hot dog in a naan-like flatbread, and the selection of condiments for your hot dogs is more unique.   I tried the Aiko, a hot dog with some sweet and spicy flavors. You have your choice of different meats for your hot dog, and I chose the spicy hot. Overall, each component in the meal was good, but it was generally just a little too sweet for my tastes.   Service was fast and friendly.  Oh and they offer veggie dogs too for those that are vegetarians. Very nice!",

Is it that hard to add a splash of oil and vinegar? I can eat plain lettuce at home.   Other than that, I love this place. Again, don't let The Bear scare you. Do it.",

I went a couple of times and even took my cousin on her birthday (who is vegan btw) and she enjoyed it. I recently went after being at work all day and they were quite busy which I understand and I patiently waited 20 mins to get a to go order. I asked about what best goes with chicken sausage because I do not eat beef or pork and have not ate a hot dog that was not turkey since 2014. Nonetheless that should not matter I got home got comfortable and got ready to eat and it was a hot dog after me asking for recommendations for chicken sausage ordering a chicken sausage and being there in total about 30 minutes! When I gave them a call I was told by two people on the phone that I have to specify as if I was expecting them to read my mind when I ordered. I considered going back to get my a remake but after the phone call with the rude staff I settled for a refund. Your food may be great but if you don't have great service than what are you here for ? You should try to help and assist your customers and if you make a mistake own up to it apologize and do what you can to make the customer happy. The girl rushed with me the whole time I was there I had to stop her because she didn't add my fries I asked for them I had to ask for a bag then I had to stop her to order a donut. You should treat every customer like they are valued. I was the only woman of African American decent there and it felt as if they did not care to serve me in the same manner as others. This morning I called to confirm my refund and they lady was very rude yet again. I will never be supporting this place again the girl that worked downtown was so nice and I seen her a couple times since I moved now she hasn't been there you guys should take notes on how to treat customers from her. Also how can you have rude employees and an even ruder manager? Please do better !",

So I called and a nice woman told me to reorder the order on uber eats and she would take care of the rest.   A few minutes later she called me and said everything was taken care of and that my new order would be sent out.   My food arrived, with an additional donut! Which was awesome.

Oh, and there's naan (think pita bread, only better) instead of a regular bun.  I ordered the \"bear\", with a very sweet BBQ sauce, peanut butter, and bacon. Sounds weird enough to work! I enjoyed it, even if the toppings outshone the bratwurst itself, probably because it was small and actually kind of bland.   Toppings usually complement the meal, but an easy criticism here is how toppings BECOME the meal itself. On the other hand, in an age in which everyone wants to innovate staples like pizza and burgers, they insist on limiting hot dogs. You've got Chicago, Sonora, chili or good ol' ball-park-style traditional. That's it. Short Leash changes that.   Also, the house-made chips suck. Half of them were soggy. I won't really hold that against them, though.   Overall, Short Leash is doing what most restaurants don't--take ONE very simple concept, and focus on executing it. It's not perfect, but they've got the best hot dog selection in town, so I can't be too hard on them.",

Definitely one of the must eats if you are in Phoenix.",

I ordered the Oliver with a brat and fries with green chilies. The fries were COLD. So cold in face that the cheese wasn't melted at all. The green chilies were from a can and the fries appeared to be from a freezer bag. Unimpressed.  The presentation of the dog was great but that was it. The \"brat\" was skinny. The cheese wasn't melted again because as we all know food must be hot to melt the cheese. The menu lead me to believe that there would be a small amount of 1000 Island on the dog and it was drenched. So drenched that it was everywhere.   The server was very attentive and helpful at first but as the end of the meal approached she disappeared. First Friday is busy and I get that so I stood up to help her with a visual cue. I stood for over 20 minutes and I ended up having to find her myself. Luckily, she was kind and offered to buy my drink for me.   The atmosphere and cleanliness and kind staff are great but the food is cold and mediocre at best. You can prepare a better dog at home. Owner please reach out because I expected better from an award winning place and would give it another shot if you respond and give me some answers!",

But when we asked our friend to take us somewhere delicious in Phoenix, she suggested Short Leash, so we threw caution to the wind and went with her.  This is definitely not your typical hot dog place. There are all kinds of flavors to choose from, and you can choose the type of wiener you get. During this visit, I opted for an all beef Bear -- peanut butter, smoked gouda, bacon, BBQ sauce, and Cracker Jack. Yep. Cracker Jack and I also don't have a good relationship, but it sounded like a good day to give things a second chance. When our orders came out, each wiener was wrapped in fluffy naan rather than the traditional hot dog bun. I was absolutely blown away by the flavor combination in the Bear. The sweetness of the BBQ sauce, Cracker Jack, and peanut butter mixed perfectly with the savory gouda and meat. I never knew a hot dog could taste so good.  Seating at this brick and mortar shop is also pretty spacious. Plenty of seats indoors and outdoors.",

I was never an adventurous hotdog-er but this place proves my fear wrong everytime I try something new. I usually get the devil dog, because it's a classic. Peppers and chilis with cheese and jalapenos, it is not for people who dont like spice. Skip the fried green tomatoe stack, its bland (but this is a hot dog place- not a cajun restaurant). Definitely dont be afraid of any of the dogs. You wont regret it. Yes chipotle cream cheese on a hot dog is scary..but...YOLO right?",

We ordered the bratwurst stuffed pretzel with a spicy beer hot sausage - $9. The sausage came out encased on a what appeared to be a pretzel boat. It was loaded with sauerkraut, onion, bacon and dressed with swiss + sweet bavarian mustard.   It was a little difficult to eat because it was so enormous, and the sausage to bread ratio was a little off, but other than that, it was good. The spicy beer hot sausage was delicious - hot, and the casing had a nice snap when you bit into it.  My favorite of the night was something call the aiko with a bratwurst - $8. Listed under the signature dog list, it comes enveloped in naan bread and topped with mango chutney + drizzle mayo. This dog made me a naan believer - I don't know what it is with the combination of the bratwurst + naan bread, but it was unlike anything I've ever eaten and it was good.  Short Leash's innovative approach to take an old American favorite into a foray of new flavors won me over. Kudos to them and their sausage game.",

On top of that, they have Uno cards at the table, and are always putting on fun/silly events.   The only less than perfect experience I've had at short leash was an understandable mix-up where our dinner service took longer than I would've liked. When I mentioned this to Brad, he immediately took ownership of the situation, made sure amends were made - even though I made it clear I wasn't asking him for anything, and that I, in fact, love Short Leash - and turned what could've been a bummer of a situation into one more reason why I constantly tell people to go try Short Leash.

You can't ever go wrong with anything on their menu.   If I could eat here every single day I would.   The beer selection is great, I love the sides and I am currently working my way down the menu to try every hot dog.",

Ordered the fried pickles they came with dragon sauce (Sriracha and mayo ) and ranch! Loved that the pickles were sweet and they were crunchy and not soggy! We also ordered the pimento cheese dip that is served with deep fried naan bread ( so good)!   I ordered he pretzel dog (pigs in a blanket on steroids) with a side of Mac and cheese! Large portion I could only eat half! The pretzel was hot and soft and the dog was large and cooked perfect! The Side of cheese is perfect to smear on! Boyfriend got the Bear, woah that was too intense for me but it did come served on the naan bread he said it was a really solid combo! Lastly wanted to say staff there is awesome checked on you cleared plates and helpful.    Small spot but defiantly worth a shot to check it out - we will be back! FYI 2$ cans of beer on Tuesday's!",

It's very unique food that's delicious, and the service was good as well.

    "text": "I wasn't particularly impressed. Food wasn't bad, but it also wasn't super great.  My friends both got the bratwurst stuffed pretzel which tasted good. Both agreed they would have liked it more if the cheese were melted. I got the Sunny (and was SUPER excited bc it hits pretty much all my food buzz words - prosciutto, arugula, pear!?!?! Goat cheese!?!?!?!? Does life get any better?). Anyways I was a little disappointed bc the naan was far bigger than the toppings filled in so it seemed like I wasn't eating very much. The flavors were good, but I did feel it was a better hot dog conceptually than in practice.  We also split the fries - poutine style. I do have to pipe in that I'm from Montreal so I like my poutine. This isn't what I would call \"poutine\" but rather just fries with some gravy & cheese on top (not cheese curds). They didn't taste bad whatsoever, but don't go in with the expectation of getting something spectacularly poutine-like! It's just a topping here.  I'm actually wondering if I had done this place wrong - maybe this is more of a day time place? Maybe there should be more dogs around? Maybe it's more of a food truck thing? Overall, I wasn't impressed and wouldn't come all the way back to Phoenix (esp for a $7.50 hot dog). If I saw a food truck around wherever I was though, I would consider stopping by!",

    "text": "I've visited the Short Leash truck several times now, and I have to help spread my love for this place.  I love this place!!      First off, the customer service is top notch.  Sometimes you have to wait a while to get your food, but that's what happens when there's a line and clearly the kitchen is tiny.  It's in a trailer!  Even when the line has been long, I've always been treated warmly and felt appreciated, which I think is charming.  Some eating establishments are more focused on turnover than character, and I think the opposite is True here.  Once I showed up when they were closed (or just about to be, at least) and they still took the time to churn out a hot dog for me!  My favorite variety so far has been the Igby (cole slaw, blue cheese, and barbecue sauce.)  The naan used instead of a bun really helps hold all the toppings in place, and it's less crumbly tasting than a regular hot dog bun.  I'm not a vegetarian, but I just don't like sausage casing. Fortunately, the veggie dog used at Short Leash tastes just like an actual dog but without that gross crunchy texture.  Awesome!    If you're a Facebook fan, you can get updates of all their fantastic sounding weekly specials and cute pictures of the dogs they're named after.  Great food, excellent service, Short Leash Dogs definitely has me on a... SHORT LEASH!  (Couldn't resist.)",

Sure, the other dogs look tempting, but a hot dog with BBQ sauce, blue cheese, and cole slaw is too good to pass up, and I crave it before I go. The chicken itself is high quality - slightly spicy, but not too much so. And the side of fried pickles ($3) is excellent and I have a hard time passing that up as well. Thankfully Short Leash goes to Urban Cookies every Tuesday for lunch, and that's just a couple miles from where I work. Of course, that means I may just have to stop in for a cookie as well...",

I go back to visit Chicago a couple times a year and it won't be as exciting to go back now because half the reason I like going back to visit is so I can stuff my face with Chicago style hotdogs, and I'll be disappointed eating there now because Short Leash is so good.  I also enjoyed the little hipster bar set up that they have and also have a good beer selection.

I really enjoy hot dogs, but I rarely eat them because the regular store bought weiners kind of gross me out. Short Leash's franks come from Schreiner's, so you know they're quality.    They were super helpful in explaining how everything was served and I couldn't decide what to try so they offered to make me a half Aiko and half Moki. They're served in flat bread to hold all the delicious toppings. The Aiko's main ingredient is mango chutney and jalapenos (almost reminded me of a sweet salsa). The Moki had green chilis, bean, and cheese. They were both so tasty, I couldn't decide which to eat first and which to save for my last bite.   I can't wait to go back and try some other great combos  (you can create your own from a long list of inventive toppings).",

Anybody can open a kitchen and a dining room and have people walk the food out to customers but when your server practically sits down at the table with you (after invited to) and jokes around with you, telling you her favorite things on the menu and secret treats that they serve, that the difference. I first learned about short leash from their Biltmore Fashion District location in \"The Union\"  which is a neat little shopping district in the middle of all the huge brand name stores. When the friendly ladies over there told my girlfriend about their original downtown phoenix location, i didn't hear the end of it until we visited. When we drove down there to try it, our minds were blown the second time, even more than they were when we first found this hidden shop at the Biltmore. WOW! Basically Willy Wonka of Hot dogs and beer floats. That's right! Beer Floats! First i've heard of those as well!!! Overall, i would say that if i was moving i would probably consider downtown phoenix just because this place would be my regular stop! Go Here! Its not a review, or a recommendation, its an Order!

Well, there's really no comparison actually, except for its approximate 12-inch size.  The fusion of a simple, yet tasty Indian bread and the ever so popular American sausage really worked.  Upon ordering, you decide on their pre-set toppings, like 5 of them OR you can customize from 20 or so toppings.  The hot dog itself with any number of toppings is only $5.  The tricky part about customizing is understanding the flavors of each ingredient! So I had to carefully choose ones that made sense! :)  I was glad to see mushrooms on the list so I had them sauteed it.  Other ones I was happy to see were the spicy mustard and siracha!  My meal came with a bag of sea salted chips and a bottle of cold, pure sugar cane ginger ale, which was quite refreshing! My total was just $8.  If any personnel from the Phoenix Suns organization is reading this or have heard, I sure hope they would consider opening up one of these in their arena.",

    "text": "Yes, I get the hype, Short Leash is a welcome addition to the Phoenix food scene, but I don't think this is the perfect food cart by any means.  The dogs are delicious, I love the local-organic focus, and the cart itself is very attractive.  I just can't seem to justify 5 stars, here's why:  The dogs are much smaller than the naan, leaving lots of bread and toppings left over.  The naan could be adjusted for the dogs a bit, I mean, if you're going to go to the trouble...  The naan is good but mine was kind of undercooked, leaving some bites overly chewy.  The toppings don't all fuse together that well, leaving much of them to drop out of the bread.  I wasn't given a fork and was left scrambling for beans.  I welcome Short Leash and wish them well, but don't go thinking it's going to revolutionize hot dogs, it's just a good dog.  Worth $5?  Maybe if the dogs were a bit bigger.",

Fried pickles are a must. Their salads are fresh and the entrees are inventive creations that leave you with a full stomach and a stupid grin.  Short Leash's Signature dogs feature meats from Phoenix's historic butcher Schreiner's Fine Sausages. The meat is grilled along with innovative and daring ingredients and then cradled in a warm naan flatbread.   By marrying fresh local ingredients with savory hot dog flavor, Short Leash has created a refreshing, fulfilling and truly transcendental hot dog eating experience. I would eat here daily if I could and I recommend it to all who enjoy life.",

However, if you're looking for a gourmet experience where loving care is paid to  every dog they cook, then this is your place. Hot dogs with gouda cheese, bacon, and even peanut butter as toppings. I had the bacon-wrapped bockwurst with german potato salad and it was delicious. Even the kids dogs with basic ketchup and mustard are wrapped in a pita rather than a bun and my boys really enjoyed them.  Additionally, at least at the Central and Camelback location they have a firepit and sell Smores kits which made my boys very happy and will be enjoyed by adults as well.  Finally, the service was great! Despite the crowds, service was friendly, attentive, and very prompt - which is something you don't always find at food trucks.  Short Leash Dogs - we will be back!",

    "text": "I've wanted to try Short Leash for a long time, but I never got on board with the food truck trend. Why would I want to sit outside in the hot downtown sun when there are a hundred actual (air conditioned) restaurants in the area? When I heard they got an actual brick-and-mortar location, I was stoked, but had already moved across the country so I didn't get the chance to experience what everyone was going on about until now.  It's right next to a gallery in a very artsy district of downtown (I think it's now literally called the Roosevelt Arts District), so lots of murals and public art, which gives it a nice feel. The parking lot is shared with a lot of other businesses so it looked really busy when there was still plenty of seating inside. They have a nice patio, too, which was perfect for this December afternoon, but I'm not sure how much use it gets during the 9 months of summer. I tried the Mac Daddy, which is a beef hot dog in a naan topped with chili mac. The macaroni and cheese was good, though not as cheesy as \"three cheese\" would suggest. The chili was typical bean and beef chili, could have come from a can as far as I could tell. I loved that it came in a naan rather than a bun, so it had more toppings than your typical dog. I didn't like the tray it was served in - it keeps the taco/dog/thing upright for the toppings but when you start making a mess, the metal triangle just gets in the way. It should have been covered with a paper wrap under the dog, rather than being on top of the tray paper. It was also served with house-made potato chips which were a little too thick but decent enough. I'm not a fan of chips so I would have rather had fries or coleslaw, but I didn't see those options on the menu.  They had a ton of drink options, including bottled sodas you don't typically see in Arizona, especially in restaurants, like Cheerwine and Faygo. They also have alcohol options with a full bar.  Overall, a really great hot dog, but I felt it was a little over priced at $9.50. Hot dogs, no matter what you slap on top, are still hot dogs. With my bottled root beer and tip, a bit over $15 for lunch. It would have felt more worth it if I liked the potato chips.",

That said, the hotdogs here are very inventive, and there's a rotating hotdog of the week, named after a local pup. They have exciting names that I can't quite remember, but they run the gamut from laden with spicy goodness to laden with sweet goodness. The Bear has peanut butter, jelly, and even cracker jacks. It also happens to be a favorite of most of my friends who go there. Fun fact? The hotdogs are wrapped in naan instead of a bun, which is a huge plus in my book! Get them with chips or a side salad :)  When I come here, as a hot-dog-hater, I love ordering a smorgasboard of apps. This is one of the few places in Phoenix where you can wrangle yourself an order of hushpuppies, and boy are they worth it. They've also got fried pickles, pimento cheese dip, and jalapeno poppers. The jalapeno poppers are pretty spicy and I do not recommend them as a solo meal!  The sneaky bit about Short Leash is their expansive beer menu. I've heard mixed reviews on the mixed drinks (see what I did there?!), but as a beer patron, I can say I'm consistently happy.

    "text": "I have always been a huge fan of Short Leash Dogs.  I just recently had dinner there with a close friend. The \"Brick and Mortar\" Short Leash dogs is located in the historic artsy Roosevelt District with all of its eclectic shops and gallerias and beautiful murals on buildings sprinkled around the district.   I have traditionally ordered the Bear Hot Dog at SLD.  It has been my staple.  When you look at the ingredients, you think... \"Who puts peanut butter, bacon and cracker jacks on a hot dog\"?  But once you give it a try, you realize, these flavors are amazing together.  I usually enjoy the fried pickles, however the last batch (see below) were a bit different and not as appetizing.  On my most recent visit, I went off script and tried the Bacon Wrapped Chedder Brat with the warm potato salad.  This was a bit of a let down.  I didn't care very much for the brat because the skin was a little thick and the taste wasn't there for me.  I definitely disliked the warm potato salad for many reasons, starting with the fact that it seems like a saucy-soupy mess. If I had known it would be so saucy, I would have passed.  There was a kid in the bunch, so we ordered a Strawberry donut.  The young child took one bite of the donut and said \"Bleh\" and pointed to her tongue.  YIKES.  Maybe those donuts are for adults only?    I had to kick them down a notch for the last meal.  Albeit, this is one of my favorite places to dine in Phoenix and I will definitely be returning.  Return Factor: 90%",

This was a monster event which included free budlight branded booze and food trucks that were changed twice each day the event was being held.  After we literally just picked up an order from the brick and mortar short leash dogs location, stopping at our condo, and coming back onto the Whatever grounds, the short leash dogs truck was also there -offering up free food. Of course.  Well I sampled the crispy dog which was a jalapeno cheese filled dog, with some cheesy spicy sauce, wrapped in a crispy corn tortilla and fried up. It was delicious. My hubs who isn't typically a fan of jalapeno'd fare also expressed the same omg this is bomb face.",

I also had a coffee cake donut with coffee cream filling. That was delicious as well.  Nothing here wow'd me as much as the indoor space did.  I wish they were opened later hours because they offer such a great indoor study/work/hangout place. They have games, free wifi. Their chai tea latte & coffee cake donut were delicious. Just a good spot, overall.  Final thoughts: yes, it's worth checking out. I've read in other reviews that they tend to run out of the \"good\" donuts towards their closing hours. It makes sense. Luckily for me, I came 2-3 hours before closing and still got me a cool donut! Also.... not a single person walked into their indoor seating area so I had it all to myself for 2-3 hours. If you need to get work done at earlier hours of the day. Come here. They even have free wifi! It's cool, nice, and really quiet :-)",

We were hungry and my hubby had been here before and liked it a lot so we decided to eat here.  Walked in, it was a bit busy but no line. Server at the walk up counter was super helpful explaining the food and nice. I got the devil dog with a chicken frank.  Hubby got chicago dog and devil dog both with all beef franks. Got our number and headed outside to grab a seat and people watch. I really wanted to love this place as I love hot dogs. I must have missed the memo as the hot dogs came out in flatbread? Te devil dog was nice and spicy because of the jalapenos but it wasnt a knock it out of the park meal.  Got a bite of hubby's chicago dog and it was better.   Service was definitely on point and the location is great.   Best part was there was a little entertainment with live music and the singer they hired sounded just like Adele. I will come back and try another dog...i hear pretzel buns are available too but I am not a pretzel fan.",

It was different to have a hot dog on a pita-- but I didn't hate it! I had the Lady dog? I can't quite remember the name. It had grilled onions, chipotle cream cheese and fried pickles. I had originally ordered the dog without the pickles-- but the chef came out and said I have to try it with the pickles since that's what makes the dog what it is! And she was totally right-- the pickles were fried perfectly. They weren't mushy or overly oily-- instead super crisp with a perfectly fried batter. Yum.  The only thing I would recommend is for the staff to be a little more aware of the customers coming in-- maybe it was just a weird day but I felt like some customers were standing around a little longer than necessary waiting for the gal at the front to help them.",

So I tried the Mayokoba.  Their own chocolate, cinnamon and other secret ingredients potion.  It was good enough that I went back and asked for another concoction, this time included cayenne pepper.  First sip had a bit of a kick that worried me if I would need an antacid before I was finished with the cup, but it ended well.  Now, on to the doughnuts. Decisions, decisions.   Plethora of flavors does not begin to describe what is found behind the front window and I was very fortunate to talk to the creator of the bundles of joyful dough. Talk about someone that loves the work and it shows.   Coconut Thai was amazing.   The second day's visit was the chocolate with spiced walnuts. If you like the chocolate doughnut - you won't go wrong with this one.  Lastly, I left them with the suggestion of having a sampler plate.  If that's available on your visit, you have me to thank.",

First let's start with the protein, all their meat is nitrate free...YEAH for healthy. You can pick from beef, brat, chicken or veggie dogs. The buns are naan patties. The ingredient list is killer. Just take a breath and jump in. The Bear had peanutbutter, gouda and crackerjacks...somehow it just works and I totally dig it. The sunny has fried peaches or pear, prosciutto arugula and honey, equally delicious.  Price/Service: 8/9 bucks for agourmet hotdog is reasonable. Service is always great.

    "text": "I've been excited about this place from the first time I saw they're \"coming soon\" sign in the window and was even more excited when I finally had a free moment to stop in and check them out earlier this week. I loved the restaurant! decor and ambiance was great, though not at all what I expected. I was expecting something far more casual. Kind of a order at the counter, it comes in a to go container and be done with it. No its very nice, decorated modern casual, cool. I sat at the bar, talked with the bartender a bit. I ordered the sausage sliders at his recommendation and they were delicious.  The reason for a four star review, rather than a five-star one is this: 1. Prices. Sliders (two small sausage sliders and a side salad) $10, glass of wine $8, piece of pie $4.50 (from Mamma Toledo's which is attached to the restaurant) and tip $6. Total bill for 1 person = $30. Did I enjoy myself? Yes, Would I have enjoyed myself even more if it was a few bucks cheaper? Definitely! Hot dogs from the food truck are $6. Here at Sit, Stay they are $8.50 and 9.50. (Yes I understand than in a brick and mortar restaurant, there is much more overhead costs, but I wasn't expecting such a big difference in price.) 2. Pie is on the menu but wasn't available. I had to go to Mamma Toledos to order my pie. As I said previously, it is part of the restaurant, so it's not like its inconvenient to get there or anything, but it means separate bill, separate tip. Just a minor inconvenience over all. Oh and it wasn't air conditioned.   Would I come here again? Absolutely! And probably frequently. It's in the perfect location for me, barely a block from the light rail. Though higher than I'd like, the prices won't deter me and I hope they don't deter you.",

    "text": "Finally caught up with the Short Leash Dogs Truck. Thanks to Twitter I have been able to track down this hotdog heaven on wheels. We caught up with the truck at the Phoenix Market this Wednesday. This is a usual stop for Short Leash and they are joined by other food trucks. Very cool scene for a Weds. night.  We pretty much ordered the left side of the menu. We ordered the \"Lady\" and \"Moki\" both hot dogs are nestled into pita like buns (delicious). Absolutely the best hotdog I have had west of Wrigley Field. Sorry, Chicago dog will always be my fav.   We also ordered a couple of the corndogs. Love their batter. Has kind of a cornbread consistency to it. I would recommend getting one or two of these.  We also ordered the fried pickles. I have always heard about fried pickles, but I have not found a place to try them. So glad Short Leash was my first. Would much rather have fried pickles than fries.   The meal was awesome. The price was awesome. The Owners are awesome. We will be supporting this food truck regularly and will make sure we spread the word with our friends.",

I got that strange dog with caramel corn in it that my friends love with a brat. It was too weird!!! I'm sorry! But the second time I got the Mac Daddy and it was like something clicked. Service can be a bit slow but relax people. The servers are working hard and they also happen to be some of the coolest people. Haha People who say the dogs are pricey don't understand the value of love. I also hate sweet pickles. But the fried pickles were bomb! Give it a try! Meet some cool people have a yummy meal for once in your life.  OH! and HOLY crap is the brunch on weekends good. I will never be the same.",

The Igby my friends should have a street named after it I would kiss that dog if I met him they start with a delicious flat bread (pita-ish) with your choice of hot dog (spicy, regular or bratwurst) I go with brat they then layer with a fresh coleslaw they add BBQ sauce to it and then layer it with blue cheese I know what ur thinking but trust me it works. I also love the fact that they put a slice of a hot pickle on the top. And the dum dum for dessert is classic.",

I already knew going in that I wanted the Bear, but there were so many other tempting things on the menu (Sweet Republic ice cream, Mama Toledo's pies, their new donuts and fritters!!). The service was great and I enjoy their homemade chips. We opted to try a donut before we left, I had the cinnamon sugar and my friend had the orange and pistachio one. I had no idea what brioche donuts were and I learned that they are much thicker/denser than your typical donut. They'd go great with a cup of coffee or tea. I with these guys the best of luck, especially since they just opened up another location.",

There's a reason why people would stand in line for 25 minutes for one of their dogs.  They're THAT good.    I was ecstatic to hear that the owners were finally fulfilling their dream of opening a sit down restaurant!  Thus, the Sit Stay Restaurant was born.  Everything that made Short Leash's food so good has carried over, and they've added even more!  The dogs are phenomenal!  Whether you go with one of the Menu items (Igby, Oliver, and Devil Dog are my favorites), or decide to build your own, you can't go wrong.  A couple other favorites:   Polka Dot Casserole, a gourmet twist on comfort food, and it is incredible!    And one I didn't see coming, the Fried Pickles!!  I didn't know what to expect, but I don't have the words to describe how amazing these are!!  You need to experience them for yourself.  There are plenty of other things on the menu to amaze you as well!  The restaurant is clean and comfortable.  The wait staff is super friendly, and the service is excellent!  You can't go wrong with Short Leash Hot Dogs, either the mobile version, or at Sit...Stay!!",

The corn dog bits were cooked perfectly with just the right amount of batter, and the hot dog wrapped in flat bread was an amazing mix of spicy flavors.

    "text": "I thought I was over hot dogs.  Short Leash has proved me wrong.  I was impressed with the concrete and tiled bar, the sleek and curved wood barstools, the gray and white wallpaper, the cute mantras of good living with fun orange and turquoise colors.   My wife and I were greeted by a very nice young lady who sat us at a community table.  Maybe it's just me... but I am usually weird about this kind of thing.  I hate to eat in public anyway, since eating time is when I get a chance to relax and not think about putting on a smile or selling something to someone.  You know?  Someone serving me.  Well, this was not the case. In this place, I saw a few people I have known from years in the Phoenix area, and then realized that the community table is a new concept that I actually enjoy.  I look forward to sitting at this table and possibly have a conversation with Alice Cooper, the Mayor, my neighbor, my teacher from 2nd grade.  This concept is especially great for a neighborhood full of artists and college students!  Thanks Short Leash for making me get out of my comfort zone and appreciating my community over great tasting food (at a community table, you are more likely to be offered a bit of someone else's appetizer...)  I am going to keep this leash short - THE FRIED PICKLES are one of the greatest things I have ever stuffed in my face.  The pickles are thick-sliced and prepared with a slight spicy kick (what they put in their brine is a mystery to me).  The panko outside is chunky, crisp, and dry!  Each bite was deep-fried magic  The staff was nice, casual, knowledgeable, and not afraid to make substitutes to give each customer what they are looking for.    The hot dogs are incredible and range from classic styles to new spins and ingredients with a unique flair that could only be born from a very competitive food truck market!  I ordered the Mac Daddy, and although the meal was not what I expected (I expected macaroni noodles but was surprised to find cheesy penne on my hot dog) I felt that it was a smart move and was probably a healthier and more tasty alternative.   The chili had black beans in it, and I give it a thumbs up too.  When we left, I felt great.  Usually when I consume a meatbrick from a pub or bar I feel like a tub of lard wallowing out into the street.  At Short Leash, I feel like they have really created something fun and savory for Phoenix that left me satisfied, relaxed and entertained.",

As mentioned by other Yelpers, the vegetarian dog isn't spectacular--however, I am always just happy that there IS a vegetarian option, and that it's available as any menu item. So nice! I had the Lady, which our server recommended, and it was so delicious. Those deep-fried pickles really get me, you know? My boyfriend had the Mac Daddy, and he couldn't stop talking about it. Seriously, the next morning he was still telling me about it and I kept having to remind him that I was there.   Overall, awesome food, awesome beer, AWESOME service. I left a note for our server, Amanda, and after the large Chainbreaker I had, I think it read like a love note; hopefully I didn't scare her, because we will absolutely be back!",

    "text": "Not the biggest lover of hotdogs, unless it is an Italian sausage with extra spice and or a Sabarette in NYC, I find myself contemplating why I have been wanting to go here for like, well, forever! Okay, at least as long as they opened their non food truck restaurant. It all started at the Neil Gaiman book signing. I am sure he is thrilled to be associated with this new addiction to food truck love. lol. I heard all about Short Leash from my downtown working and Food Truck Foodie friends. Then of course I have to continue to hear about it from all my Yelpie buddies. \"Afterwards, The Joy!\" They actually open a restaurant. I continue to hear all about it as if people were just rubbing it into my face on purpose. Okay, then what? They joined up with Momma Toledo's Pies too? The horror! Looks like a visit is a must. Finally, they are at the Downtown Revival and dare to not even serve any hotdogs. WHAT? What's up with that? ( In my best SNL singing voice) However, redemption is close by since they offer me and my Foodie Buddy this Fried Green Tomato dish with corn and bacon and a very mild Blue Cheese dressing. It was the most Delish, surprising,\"twist treat\" of the entire night. (And I hate Blue Cheese) Okay, I am convinced. I promise to go visit their permanent location now.  I swing by today after an appointment in the neighborhood. (And to digress, how much do I adore Roosevelt Row? ) I ordered the FGTs of course, again. However, I now have a foodie dilemma. This item is listed as a salad not an App.It is a meal in itself. I was hoping it would be just a small plate App so I could get a dog too. I decide to get both anyway and split the meal as leftovers for tomorrow. I can not see any way out of it. I had to have the FGTs. I dream of those FGTs! lol. I decide to get the pretzel dog too. I am still not brave enough to get the Cracker Jack and Peanut Butter one just yet, although I hear it is \"to die\" for. Maybe next time. I tell the server that she can bring a box since I will have half now and half for lunch tomorrow. Wishful thinking. Out comes this huge monstrosity of a hot dog smothered in Sauerkraut. I start eating. About half way done I am stuffed. I then look inside the box and did not notice the waitress had already split the meal for me. How sweet of her but seriously? More food. What is on my plate was only half of the dog?YIKES! So instead of two meals I got more like four out of it all.   Anyway, the food was great and the service even better. I had a revelation on the drive home. ( Not a surprising one) I am still not a huge hotdog fan, just saying. However, with Short Leash, who knows? It could happen. I most certainly am a new Short Leash and FGTs fan for life now. ;) If you like dogs check it out. I read they even have a Veggie option. Hmmmm, that sounds weird but I heard it is good.   See you next time Short Leash. Maybe with a four legged patio dining companion. Did I mention I like the Fried Green tomatoes?",

This was a new experience for him.  He loved it though.  He said the fruit wasn't sweet, it was more like a chutney.  The goat cheese and Naan is what made this dog.  He liked the salad on the side but did say his was wilted too.",

    "text": "My husband and I are in Phoenix this week for business and tried out Short Leash Hot Dogs at their physical restaurant (\"Short Leash Sit... Stay\") on Roosevelt St. It was absolutely wonderful! We saw the great reviews for both the restaurant and the food truck here on yelp and figured we'd give it a go. I'm so glad we did! Even though we're only here for a few more days, we definitely plan on returning. Walking in the atmosphere was very relaxed and slightly artsy - very cool. We were seated promptly by a very friendly, pleasant employee (I think she was the bartender) and given water before even having to ask for it. Each table was set with a metal basket containing napkins, silverware, flowers, and Uno! The game! Of course, this totally distracted my husband and he became almost more distracted by winning the game than ordering food!   We each had a drink besides water - I had the Blackberry Cobbler cocktail and he had a locally brewed peach beer from Four Peaks. Both were so good and came out shockingly fast! The cocktail was slightly tart with hints of vanilla and cinnamon and chunks of real raspberry. The beer was sweet-ish and very peachy - just what he likes! I'm not a beer connoisseur so I'm sure that I am describing the taste wrong. I loved that Short Leash takes pride in serving local food/drinks. It introduced us to a brewery that we probably wouldn't have known was here! Now that we know about it (and he loved the beer) we'll probably try out the Four Peaks tasting room!  The food also came came out extremely quickly and was very unique, filling, and delicious! We started out with the fried pickles which ended up being the best we've had. The pickles weren't overly battered and were served VERY quickly with ranch and a delicious concoction they call \"Dragon Sauce\" (order it by the gallon - it is that amazing!). For the main course I had the Vegetarian Lady hot dog with a side salad and the hubs got the Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel with house made chips.  They both were totally different dishes but each were wonderful in their own way!   The Vegetarian Lady was a vegetarian dog with chipotle cream cheese, sauteed onions, and fried pickles served on naan. Oh. My. Goodness. This was seriously a magical creation bursting with flavor! I loved the fact that their dogs are served on naan - it definitely makes eating a lot less messy. The side salad it was served with had a delicious house vinaigrette that was bright and flavorful.   The Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel was a monster of a meal - a brat slow cooked in local beer and stuck through a round housemade pretzel bun topped with sauerkraut, onions, bacon, Swiss cheese and sweet Bavarian mustard. Wow. The sauerkraut/sweet Bavarian mustard combination was honestly the star of this dish. My husband and I agreed that it was the best sauerkraut we've ever had - I think the sweet Bavarian mustard was what made it amazing! The house made chips were really yummy especially when dipped in the Dragon Sauce.   Overall, writing this review is making me crave this awesome local eatery! We will definitely go back during our time here in Phoenix and be sad when we return to Kansas City and aren't able to become regulars.",

The food was so sloppily prepared and presented that you wore it more than ate it. No forks or knives in sight and it could not be eaten by holding it without all the toppings falling off onto the paper plate. What a mess. there is a hot dog vendor working out of a little room at the Oak Creek Brewery in Sedona that puts Short Leash literally on a short leash...and to shame. Try it next time you are in Sedona. Sorry Short Leash lovers but you are busted as far as I am concerned.",

If they had a better veggie dog, the concept is fun so I would probably have given them a 5 star review.   Other than the dog, their fried pickles were awesome, and we had great service. I also indulged and had an orange glazed pistachio donut.... AMAZING!",

I will start by saying the actual hotdogs themselves were tasty but nothing spectacular. However, the chilli that was on top of the hotdog had no flavor and tasted like it was out of a can. The Miko hotdog was good but all didn't provide any flavor. The fried pickles were sweet and the breading was hardly on them though when brought out. Furthermore, the mac n cheese was horrible and lacked flavor all together and was NOT cheesy. Certainly will not be going back here.",

    "text": "So I am usually short leash's number one fan but I had to share this outrageous experience I had today. I ordered food on Grubhub as usual to deliver to my apartment. Keep in mind that my apartment is two blocks away from this place at most. On Grub hub they have short leash and rollover listed as two separate restaurants, so you cant order them at the same time. So as soon as I put in my order for my hot dogs, I called short leash immediately and asked if I could place an order for doughnuts and I would pay for them in cash so they could bring both orders at the same time. The evil girl on the phone (who sounded miserable with her life) told me no and that I would have to go back on the app and order it separate. She then proceeded to tell me that they would make sure both orders were delivered together (after I expressed that I didn't want to put them through the trouble of having to come here twice). Next thing I knew, my hot dogs were delivered and there were no donuts. Before I could even call them, I received a phone call from grub hub telling me that the restaurant had cancelled my order because \"they had no donuts left.\" So being the detective that I am, I had my boyfriend call rollover doughnuts and ask what donuts they had left for the day, and the girl (miserable as usual) read off numerous donuts they had left. Therefore they basically cancelled my order because they didn't want to bring them, after I had tried to make it easier for them, and they blatantly lied and lost my service due to being lazy. It's sad because the food there is so good and I've been such a huge customer and big fan. Shame on this place and the terrible employees.",

The staff seem really happy to work there, which says something. Our waitress was super knowledgeable about different beers and the menu. We MAY have overdid it with the corndog appetizer AND a hot dog meal each, but I have no regrets. Those cheddar jalepeno dogs have my heart, and so does Short Leash.",

Like a little girl, I was giddy and big-eyed to walk up to the cute little window with a stunning display of doughnuts. I stood there for awhile trying to decide what to try. Boy, it wasn't easy. I wanted to get them all but I knew that I shouldn't. I went with the strawberry glazed and their featured doughnut of the week - cookies & cream. Oh wow. Their doughnuts are so fluffy and soft. I could tell the strawberry glaze was made with so much love and the filling in the C&C was amazing - perfectly creamy and not too sweet. Essentially a cookie in cream form, lol. I hope they make this one often. So good. This is what I love about local businesses. Although I may not have been eating the most fresh doughnuts at 2pm, they were quality to me. I picked up a bag of their dog treats for my pup - $1/2. She loved them! They have a small counter/bar with water available for you to enjoy your doughnuts as well as a cute studio next door with places where you can sit or do some work.  I'm not sure if Short Leash food truck is always parked there but they were when I came in. I am loving downtown Phoenix more and more because of gems like these.",

Let's face it, real hot dogs have a je ne sais quoi about them because you pretty much don't know what is in them. While I can't speak to the quality of the real meat hot dogs which are probably higher quality that Oscar Meyer and likely consist of real meat, I can tell you that buying veggie dogs from the store will never suffice again. No it's not that the roll of mystery non-meat is a superb mockup of actual meat, it's the furnishings. Who the heck thought of delicately and lovingly wrapping this cylindrical American staple in a fabulously plush piece of exotic non-American naan? These guys.   As for the toppings, I am so indecisive about choosing among the incredibly delicious options that I typically just tell them to surprise me so long as it's not bacon. Blue cheese? Well usually I'm vegan, but for this...yes. Cabbage? Um yes. And whatever that is on that guy's hot dog before me, I want that too. I have never finished consuming one of these hot dogs wanting anything more from life at that moment. So while \"it goes without saying,\" it's worth being said over and over. This is yum.",

I am so happy that I woke my arse up early this Saturday to get down to the Phoenix Public Market to try SLD. For a mere $5 I got what a lot of people will call a gourmet hot dog, but what I would call an ingenious new take on American street food. It was filling, flavorful and a perfect way to start my day. Not only that, but the owners were super friendly and happy too chat with me!   Do yourself a flavor and read the other reviews on Yelp, look them up on Facebook, find their schedule and be at their next location to get yourself a damn-good dog. I can't wait to go back!",

    "text": "I was really excited to give this place a try.  I hate to be a bit negative but I will be honest.  Rollover does have quite a few different doughnuts to choose from and the names and descriptions seemed very tempting to me.  I decided to buy a few so I can share the goodness with my family.  Bought 6 (pricey) but thought it would be worth it. They looked so good to me. The description of each doughnut was sounding good. Took them home and everyone had a taste of each doughnut.  There was no mmmm, there was no OMG. Just ehh ok.  So I believe it is the dough itself that just killed it.  The variety that I picked were the maple doughnut , pistachio,coffee cake doughnut, chocolate, and vanilla. To me the dough was very heavy. These doughnuts tasted like they were literally a week old. Everyone at home said that.  Maybe we did get old doughnuts.  I don't know. So a lot of people asked me at the office what I thought I said I didn't like them.  I didn't tell anyone not to try them. But no one wants to pay for a pricey doughnut and be disappointed.  Especially if you have that craving for just a doughnut. Just with that being said when we went to Food Truck Friday everyone went for the pies.",

    "text": "While waiting for the Lunar New Year festival to open at Hance Park, J and I scoured the vicinity for some breakfast. We saw a sandwich board advertising breakfast, so we decided to stop in. The decor is super hipster, with fun doggo decor and trinkets. I do like what I call 'the quiet room' to the side of the main restaurant area. The food trucks are parked outside, and I totally need the baby vintage ice cream truck in my life! It was adorable! When we came in, there was no one else there. We waited at the counter in silence, looking around like lost puppies off the \"short leash\". The blue-haired gal at the counter made it super weird by looking at us and asking if we were just there for a doughnut. After stuttering a while, we told her \"breakfast\". We also ordered a maple bacon doughnut from the case. This doughnut was fantastic. #1, bacon. #2, icing. And #3, bacon.  The menu had a few breakfast items on it. I got the breakfast corn dog, and J got the breakfast sausage bowl. We also ordered a plain coffee for J, and a chai for me. The gal takes our order and disappears into the kitchen. And we wait. She comes out and ignores another patron, then eventually hits him with the same awkward doughtnut line. As if asking a question, seemingly as taken aback as we, he replies \"um, breakfast?\". Before running his order back, she looks at J and says \"the drip coffee's over there\", geaturing with a nod to the coffee stand, where there is no sweetener, no stirrers, and sparse half & half, while dropping an empty paper cup on the counter. She says nothing about my chai.  The corn dogs on sticks were served with a warm syrup and apple slices. I really liked them, although I found that the casings of the sausage made them really difficult to bite through and eat. J didn't care for his bowl too much, and the jalapeno sausage was very, very spicy. The gal must have seen him sweating, because she asked if we wanted water, bringing us a bottle and glasses. She also tells me that she'll make my chai \"right now\". To my chagrin, the Oregon Chai mix box came out, and it was steamed and poured. She then added the almond milk and foamed it. I took a sip, and it was cold. After a few minutes, I was able to get her attention to heat it up. It was underwhelming, as the mixture was clearly more milk than chai. We left without thanks or fanfare. Nobody cared that we were there anyway, so... For our meal, it was NOT worth 30+ bucks,  and we will not be back.",

Peanut butter, gouda, bacon, bbq sauce and CRACKER JACKS on top of a hot dog (all beef is my fav), rolled up in a piece of fresh naan bread. I didn't believe I'd like it until I tried it myself. I dare you to order the Bear, and if you hate it, call me and I'll eat it and buy you something else. I'm sure the other unique options are just as delicious as the Bear, but I can't stay away. That being said, Short Leash Hotdogs isn't a restaurant you can frequent every day or every week. Too rich, too many calories.  I've yet to try their donuts, simply because they are always sold out when I come in. They've got a breakfast menu so I'll have to stop by earlier in the day. Cocktail selection is intriguing, and I'm looking forward to the day I'll have time to grab a drink here.  Despite being downtown, there is ample parking adjacent to the building. Service is quick and friendly. Definitely worth your time!!  5/5 delicious eats 5/5 service 0/5 no donuts available late in the day :(",

I enjoyed the food and selection and wanted to try a donut the next time, so I came back the following Sunday with family, we got there 10 minutes before closing, I didn't realize they closed at 3pm on a Sunday. Although what kind of restaurant closes at 3pm even on a Sunday. That's neither here nor there, however we arrived BEFORE closing. We were about to walk in when one of the staff stopped us, telling that they were about to close, you could tell she didn't want to seat us and she didn't even offer to let us order takeout, she just wanted to get rid of us. I was disappointed in the experience. Since it's about 30 minutes from where I live, I don't think I'll be coming back or recommend it to others.",

Had the \"Mac daddy\" hot dog covered in macaroni/cheese and vegan chili, amber beer and for dessert..  2 donuts!!!!  Orange pistachio and a coffee type donuts.   So scrumptious and excited it's in my neighborhood.  Parking is in the back.   They have an array of specials weekly.  Meatless Monday's, tasty Tuesday ($5 canned wine), weiner wine Wednesday ($6 whiskey drinks), thirsty thursdays (tasting of wine, beer and spirits), fry days ($2 off beer pitchers and loaded fries), etc",

Looking at the menu alone, there are SO many options. A lot of combinations and flavors offered. They also have several different kinds of hot dogs offered...including a veggie dog.  I ended up having the chili Mac hot dog with a veggie dog. It was $9 and I had it with a side of fries. I shared it with my partner, and it gave our stomachs enough to be full for 3-4 hours. So why the three stars? For a $9 hot dog - I expected more. The veg chili was okay, the Mac n cheese was good, the pita or as they call it...naan was probably not homemade, AND the veggie dog was for sure store bought (Smart Dog). I'd rather buy a pack of smart dogs and save $10.  Sure, may be worth it for meat eaters. For vegetarians...pass. May come back for cheese curds and beer, but no to the hot dogs.",

    "text": "Pretty cool idea, lots of different options on the menu to choose from. The beer selection was decent for canned beers but the only had one brand on tap and the one I wanted was out.  (typical)  We ordered the loaded fries as an appetizer and each got a hot dog. The dogs actually came out first which is super annoying, but what was more concerning than getting the main course before the app was the fact that the food came out in a matter of minutes.   The brats, dogs, and fries have to be sitting back there already cooked and ready to go. I'm all for quick service, but I'd much rather wait and have freshly made food.   I got the Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel. Although it looks huge, its basically 90% bun. The inner bratwurst was very thin. I also would have enjoyed it a bit more if the swiss cheese on top was melted. The pretzel bun was delicious and overall the sandwich was good.  I would come back again but I'd be lying if i said I wasn't a bit disappointed after reading all the amazing review on here.",

The sides are all good--fries or cold slaw---and everything is served in this amazing metal tins with compartments. I also like the hotdog with sauerkraut and thousand island dressing. On the donuts side, come early or the best, fresh made choices might be gone like the coconut spicy Thai one. Overall, a fun place to have lunch and sit outside on the patio or inside when it's too hot outside.",

The sausage was tasty, the bun held up well, and the plating was pretty. Added on a side of fried pickles, and they were thick-cut and clearly fresh-made. There are local beers on tap, and we had a great amber ale. They serve several of their dogs wrapped in naan, which is a fun twist we were looking forward to trying with another order.   The pickles were amazing but the dog was served at roughly the temperature of the sun, and had so much mustard on it that it was a terrible mess to eat. And then we saw a hair on it. At first I thought it was probably my own from rearranging and photographing my food, but when we cut the dog to share it, my guy found another that clearly was not mine. We didn't touch our food after that, and opted out of the donuts at the adjacent shop as well. Staff didn't say a word as we left after ten minutes and only half our meal.",

I ended up choosing a chocolate one which I think had some hint of heat in it. There was no real chocolate flavour and I was trying to discern the other flavour nipping at my palate.

I got the custom build your dog: Bratwurst, cheese, and mayo with chips.  It was disappointing to be just OK.  I have had better Bratwurst.  Maybe I should have gotten the Bratwurst Stuffed Pretzel, it got great reviews.",

    "text": "I've been here twice and both times the staff and management shit the bed.  First time I came, they didn't have enough competent wait staff to handle the patio at half capacity. When I went inside to grab a brew, the staff informed me that I had to stay with my group and order outside. I asked to just order one beer. Denied. Screw you, I'm not spending money here.  About four months later, I came for killer prices on craft cans and $2 off appetizers. Seems like the place is trying to make amends, right? So, they decided to make the place counter service only, and you have to wait in line (the kitchen opens directly into the line which is annoying). They tell me that the credit card machine is buggy, but I got 40 bones in my pocket. No problem, right? Well, after waiting 15 minutes in line, and hungry for some gourmet corn dog action, I finally learned my lesson about this TERRIBLE business.  Here's why the CAPS. The manager decides that, as my hungry ass gets to the counter, and after having served 20 people in front of me, that her register is broken, and cannot serve me. But, I patiently waited about 10 minutes to see if I can get some dog. And yes, I know it was the manager, because she said \"my employees.\" I even offered solutions. I told her that I have cash. \"Nope. It's broken, can't do anything.\" I asked her to write down my order and I'll pony up when you get the register fixed. \"Nope, can't do anything.\" What, you don't have the tech to WRITE my order and charge me later?  Even though you served 20 people in front of me? Nope, \"I know this is frustrating for you.\"  Ok, lady. Like the 40 people behind me in line who left already, I'm not \"frustrated;\" I'm annoyed. My $40 will be spent on food somewhere. I don't give a crap where. I'm a seasoned professional, and you're a foolhardy and patronizing manager of a glorified hot dog stand. I'll get food. You won't get my money. You're too dense to write down orders IN A RESTAURANT. Not my problem. That's not \"frustrating\" to me.   TL;DR:  the staff is arrogant and idiotic. Apparently they don't like making money. The owner should fire everyone, but apparently doesn't read reviews.",

    "text": "They've got the hot dogs. You want the hot dogs. This is where you get the hot dogs downtown!   Unfortunately the hot dogs do not taste very good and that is putting it politely. I have tried several variations including the chicago dog and the moki and each time i am less than thrilled.  Per their website: \"At Short Leash Hotdogs our mission is to create a unique twist on a classic favorite\".  I think this is part of the problem; No one asked for a hot dog served in naan bread, it's strange and unwelcome. The issue for me is the ratio of naan to hot dog, it is completely and utterly out of whack. The dogs themselves (you can choose between beef/brat etc...) are small, particularly when placed at the bottom of a parachute-sized naan.  I recently gave the chicago dog another shot. Their food truck was situated at Hance park for an event. I was let down again, I was also figuratively let down as all of the toppings fell out of the naan as I picked it up to take a bite. It seems to me that they just don't really try that hard and it shows in the food.   The staff is always polite and the actual restaurant is in a good location on Roosevelt Row but I think the concept is where they went wrong. I will not eat there again, there are far better options in the area.",

The reason I gave 2 stars was the coffee... I don't think I could buy or make worse iced coffee.   I asked for liquid sugar and he said he didn't have any (which is weird because regular sugar cannot dissolve in ice), but he was nice and offerred to add \"flavors\" then listed the names starting with carmel. I was thinking it was carmel cane sugar which is liquid sugar so I asked for \"a half a pump of carmel.\" I left without noticing he just put a whole spoon full of carmel in the bottom. If I enjoyed very sweet coffee this would have been nice, but I do not. Luckily he didn't mix it in so when I got home I just dumped the coffee in another cup without the carmel. The second I tasted the coffee I realized the low quality. It's almost like you need tons of sugar and cream to mask the actual taste.   If you like a little coffee with your sugar and cream I suggest you come here, but if you like good iced coffee, this is absolutely not the place to go.  A couple side notes:  - I have asked other coffee shops for liquid sugar in downtown Phx and on a couple occasions the worker had no idea that their vanilla cane sugar was actually liquid sugar.  - I thought that specifying \"a half a pump\" and motioning my hand as if I was pumping the sugar would indicate I was talking about cane sugar. - I was so sad because I threw away my coffee and just made a fresh pot of my coffee at home :/ I was really looking forward to it.  - Lastly, the guy working there was really nice and I liked the place. I just know now... never get the coffee lol",

    "text": "Finally made it down into this part of town to check out what everyone else was barking about. Really love the Hot Dog and they do a totally different kind of spin on this puppy.  The restaurant is in an older building that has been around the block a few times. They definitely did a fine job fixing it up and giving it a nicely revamped interior. It is simple yet modern in a unique way.  Ordered the Devil Dog with an all Beef Hot Dog and then a Bear Dog with the Spicy Beer Hot Dog. My eyes were apparently bigger than my stomach and I could barely finish the bear. Lions, Tigers and Bears ... Oh My!  The menu has plenty of choices and different ways that you can build your own Dog. They even have several appetizers and some tasty beers on tap when you need to wet your whistle.  Both the food and service were delightful. Everyone there was having a great time and even saw plenty of families getting together on my Sunday visit to break Naan.  This place is really popular. So popular that I had the special occasion to meet Mr. Laz C and his lovely family at the adjacent table next to me. Noticed he checked in at the same time and had not met him before. Looked around and there he was finishing off his tasty meal. Couldn't resist a quick shout out and a handshake.  Bring the family and a good appetite and you will not be disappointed. Parking is a little sparse and the weekend crowd was not too crazy. Most of all don't forget to check in and see who else is there eating at the same time. WUZ UP BRO!  4.75 STARS",

The great thing about the sit down restaurant from Short Leash is the beer. I mean really. What goes better with that all American dog than a frosty cold American style IPA from a local brewery? Uh... Not a damn thing! Plus this place has appetizers and a dollar on the wall. Can you get that from your other hot dog place? I think not! It's great for groups, as long as you're not a group of buttheads. Or a super large group. Ain't nobody got time for that...   Only thing you should definitely be aware of is that the price is a tad higher than if you ordered the same thing from the truck. So I always try and stray from my usual and venture out onto the rest of the menu.   I have yet to try breakfast but I will soon!",

The \"apple fritter\" - and I keep using quotes because they just can't be serious - tasted like a stale Circle K discard. And it was super tiny. Also had the pistachio, chocolate cinnamon, maple bacon, Thai coconut and black and blue...  Which reminds me. The black and blue was actually good. Not amazing. But original, and pretty good. That donut, along with the super sweet but ultimately misguided about what constitutes a \"good donut\" cashier alllllmost earned the place a second star, but the abysmal failure of the only two things that truly matter - value and quality - keep this joint in one-star territory.",

The whole menu was available which meant that our guests with dietary restrictions (vegan, gluten free, etc.) were taken care of as well. My father in-law was INSTANTLY obsessed and ate at least four hot dogs. Our guests could not get enough. We originally looked at caterers that would have cost a minimum of $50 per person. Short Leash ended up costing about $10 a meal. You can't beat that. If we ever do another large scale party, we will definitely be giving Short Leash a call.",

I think I might have even cheated once and eaten a chicken dog. Things have changed and now I have to say that I am enjoying even more. It was hard I stray from the Moki because it was very yummy, but I've tried the Igby, Oliver and the Lady with either a beer hot or polish. All of which are fabulous. To my surprise, the Lady on a beer hot is my favorite (I was scared off by fried pickles at first). What I also love about this brand is how real, authentic and grounded the team is. Brad and Kat are so genuine and they've attracted a motley crew. I wish I could eat here every day.",

It is fresh and moist. I could eat the bread alone, but topped with a juicy chicken dog, and all the toppins', I could not ask for a better lunch on a beautiful, sunny, Phoenix, Friday afternoon.",

    "text": "Absolutely Amazing Hot Dog! As a matter of fact, calling it simply a hot dog is an understatement. I had the Beer Hot- Aiko Style and was really happy with my choice. I would've never thought to put that combination of ingredients together on a hot dog but it works! The warm Naan bread was so good, I'm suck a sucker for warm bread. I visited them at Food Truck Friday's in Phoenix and the whole time I was there they consistently had the longest line of all the other food trucks yet their service was relatively fast. I'd say to go out of your way to hunt them down at least once because they are worth it! As far as a food truck is concerned I don't think they could've done any better! They have great food, an eclectic drink selection and friendly service.",

I had the pleasure of experiencing this tasty treat before a recent Secret Cinema Event.  I was excited to give this food truck a try, as it's been on my \"to try\" list for quite some time.  Now down to business... the food...  I ordered a regular wiener \"lady\" style and shared a side of fried pickles.  The fried pickles were everything a fried food should be and more.  Perfectly seasoned, fried golden, and served warm with a side of ranch.  YUM.  I could eat those babies all day.  As for the dog, it was to die for.  Loved the pita bread, the spicy mayo, and of course more fried pickles.  The dog had a great \"snap\" and was extremely flavorful on it's own.  The Hubs had the spicy dog with the style that featured peanut butter.  It was surprisingly sweet, but also very good.  Though we had to wait awhile for them to cook up our order, it was surely worth the wait.  I can't wait to try some more of Short Leash Dogs amazing offerings!",

    "text": "I wanted to love this.  I've been a fan of the food truck for a long time now.  So when they opened up a brick-and-mortar restaurant, I couldn't wait to try it out.  I visited on a Friday night, and the place was packed.  It's not a very large place to begin with, but it was busy.  We sat down to wait and, while waiting, the hostess brought out glasses of ice water to help keep us cool.  Finally, we were seated in one of their few tables and ordered our meals.  My wife ordered the Sunny dog & salad plate and it was perfect... peaches, grilled chicken sausage, goat cheese all wrapped in the naan bread with a salad on the side made for a delicious dinner.  I tried the Pig in a Blanket, and the mashed potatoes & dog were fantastic.  The green beans were a little on the raw saw, but overall a good dish.  Overall, the food was good.  The hot dogs and sausages were still the stars here.  The only problem with this is that I could get those from the food truck at a reduced price.  If I'm paying $9 or $11 for an entree, I want something better than just a good hot dog.  And unfortunately, the ambiance was only so-so, as it was a loud, open room with no air conditioning.  It didn't feel like a place that I could settle down and enjoy for a night out.    In summary, good food but nothing that stands out compared to the food truck.  The service was wonderful at the restaurant, but I've always received wonderful service at the food truck as well.  And given the price difference for a sit-down meal as opposed to just a quick food truck stop, I'd rather stick with the food truck.",

I took some suggestions in the line and I got a Spicy Beer Dog on the \"Lady\" set up. I also splurged on the fried pickles and a bottled water. 10 dollars even steven.

The meal was great, well-cooked and just greasy-spoon enough for me to enjoy without feeling like I was about to birth some other-worldly creature. The decorations inside are cool, one might call them industrialized-modern like many of the other new spots popping up around the downtown area. I'm fine with that.   They also had Chainbreaker from Deschutes Brewery on tap, big plus in my book. It was clean and well-lit. Nothing really out of the ordinary as far as hot dogs go, it's worth mentioning that you can get anything you might get on the truck here, as well as a bevy of other options that aren't available on the truck. Definitely worth a try for lunch or maybe a super-casual dinner.",

So, that inspired the 22+ mile trip for a hot dog.  We started with the fried pickles. They were good and unique but I was satisfied after two or three and there was a big basket for 6$. I ordered the Oliver with a spicy beer hot dog. When I picked it up, water literally ran out of it for lets say 20 seconds. Too late, my naan was now soggy. Clearly no one even attempted to drain the sauerkraut. The taste was there  and the salad was exceptional. Partner had the Moki. That was divinity wrapped up in a naan. What a crazy good combo of deliciousness on a spicy dog. We would definitely order this puppy again....with a salad. The chips were boring. So we drove 22+ miles, spent $42 on hot dogs (with two delicious tap beers and tip) and will do it again. The restaurant is darling and funky!",

I was excited to try it out however, the whole experience left me pretty underwhelmed.  The restaurant's atmosphere is really great. A lot of seating both indoor and out as well as a small bar area. We sat outside by choice which was lovely. It took a little while to get rolling with the waitress as she really took her time to take our order/bring it out. The bloody mary/beer fusion that I was amped to try was not on the menu (even though it is online) so I ordered their regular bloody mary which was overwhelmingly spicy and had no traces of alcohol. All the beer which my boyfriend inquired about was also not available.  The food itself was tasty but with the tiniest portions. I ordered a hot dog with a tiny side salad for $8.50! The salad itself I finished in about three or so bites and the hot dog was so small inside a huge naan outter layer and toppings. I was hoping for that amount of $$ I would be getting larger portions. The particular hotdog I ordered was the \"Lady\" and was covered in way too much cream cheese with fried pickles which were cold with all of the outter layering having fallen off. The donuts my boyfriend got ($2.25 a pc!) Were also tiny.   Overall if your looking for small portions at cost and spotty service go here. Otherwise, I think there are better places to go in that area.",

All in all, it's the type of place you feel good about supporting.  As far as the brat, I went with the Moki (roasted green chilis, pinto beans, tomatoes, cheddar, etc.). The brat and the toppings individually were solid, but I wasn't sure about the combo, which was my fault. I might go for one of their signatures next time, which eliminates the selection of the meat. Comes with a side of greens or chips; the greens were a tasty way to break the whole thing up. Afterward, they offer a few types of pie from Mamma Toledo's, or you can just walk over to the pie display (connected inside the restaurant) and pick from any of them. $4 for a slice is definitely worth it.  You should go here.",

    "text": "\"How will Short Leash be able to translate all the good things about their food truck into a sit down restaurant?\" was my only question when I ventured over to Roosevelt Row last week. Imagine my surprise when I had all of my expectations topped.   Upon entering their new establishment, my mom and I were greeted by a host. Totally unexpected. In fact, I walked right past the stand and in to the dining area. A bit embarrassing! Oh well!  We were promptly seated at a community style table we shared with another family. The furnishings were all clean, modern, and not fussy. We loved the geometric wallpaper on the north wall. Very cool.   Our server was low key and likeable, and showed us around the menu I know so well from patronizing the truck for several years now. My mom was less familiar, and he helped her build her order patiently.   We were served our food with cloth napkins, glassware for our beverages, and metal silverware. This all made for a great dining experience.   The food was delicious as always, and they still offer a wide selection of bottled sodas to pick from. We didn't order desert, but the selections from the Pie Hole looked and sounded tasty too.   As I said, my expectations were definitely exceeded! What a great business this is. I enjoy the owners and the company they are building. The care and deliberation they are showing is very apparent.",

I like the pita bread/tortilla idea and it was good, but I suppose it's more of a novelty thing, and I like the traditional bun. Next time I'll try their pretzel dog. I had the Moki, and reminded me of a chili cheese dog.  The thing that bumps them up a half star if i could is their fried pickles. Id come in any day for an order of those bad boys",

    "text": "Wow...I consider myself lucky to have had the opportunity to try this place the other night and sad that I hadn't made it over there before!  I love hotdogs, but rarely do I have one that lives up to the hype.  For instance, I had one a month or so ago that had been written up in a couple of magazines, and I was very disappointed because, although the meat was very good, the bun was too big, so really all I tasted was bread...definitely not the case with the Short Leash dogs!  I love, love, love the fact that they are served in naan instead of a bun.  Like the example I mentioned, buns too often dull the taste of the dog.  I ordered the Oliver, an all-beef dog topped with melted swiss, sauerkraut, and Thousand Island, and I added fried pickles!  Holy hot dogs, it was amazing!!  My friend and I had split the corn dogs bites to start with, and they were very delicious and sizeable--definitely more than \"bites.\"  So, I figured there was no way I would eat my entire hotdog.  But it was so delicious that I just couldn't put it down!  My friend had the Mac Daddy, which she loved.  I took a bite of it, and the mac 'n' cheese and chili combination was fantastic.  The only thing I didn't like was my drink.  I had some sort of sangria, but not the raspberry one, and it just tasted very odd.  I will not order that again, but I will definitely be back to Short Leash as soon as I can for the food!  I want to try almost everything on the menu :)  One more thing, I saw someone else's review that said that the corndog bites were undercooked and \"bizarre\"...they must have had an off day at that visit because they were wonderful when I had them.  I've actually never had corndog bites outside of the southeast that I've been happy with, and these were perfect.  They were perfectly cooked and a perfect ratio of meat to batter!  They are quite large and filling, though, so, if you have a small appetite, you might want to skip them, split them, or have as entree.",

    "text": "Sit....Stay and you won't be disappointed. Short Leash takes a great American pass time food, the hot dog, and turns it into a dining experience to not miss out on. Their gourmet style hot dogs will thrill your taste buds in the moment and leave you salivating for more after. I am getting Pavlovian just writing this review.  The dining atmosphere is cozy, the wait staff is very friendly and knowledgable about their products.  There is a small area for bar seating and several tables for larger groups.  The decor is minimalist which adds to the charm.  There is no outdoor seating which is great for the hot summer months.  I went with some friends and arrived after walking a mile in the 115 degree afternoon sun. The first we ordered was water and lots of it.  Our server was so nice as to not only leave the pitcher of water but brought out two more.  They were all gone by the time our dinner was done.  And she provide waters in Togo glasses after hearing our story when our meal was done. That was great thoughtfulness.  My friends who had never experienced the food truck were dazzled by all of the options available for a hot dog so they each chose a create your own.  I ordered the Bear because they didn't believe that bacon and peanut butter with crackers could be delicious on a hot dog.  They were eating their words once they had one bite of the deliciousness.  Dave H. ordered the deviled dog and thought it was the most amazing gourmet dog he'd ever eaten.   If you have never tried the food truck I recommend trying the restaurant you won't be disappointed.  If you have tried the food truck try the restaurant as there are added delicious treats that await.  Treats like corn dog skewers for appetizer and a delicious key lime pie for dessert. I already have plans to return with more friends.",

The donuts have to go back from whence they came.  Good idea. Good flavor combos. Bad execution.  If any, work on the dough part of the nut.  It just doesn't taste right.  Toppings aren't bad, at least the orange one that I tried...but alas did not finish, as the rest of it (all that was not topping) just couldn't happen in my world.  Please work on the dough and try again. I really want to support the donut.  It is chewy and odd and sour-ish and leaves a horrid aftertaste on the buds,  and just all-around not very nice...kind of like weird yeasty, sourdough bread dough that had been deep fried.

    "text": "Short Leash Dogs is obviously a front runner in the relatively small but beautifully thriving food truck scene in Phoenix.  Their truck had one of the longest lines today (Food Truck Friday @ Phx Public Market), and since I wasn't feeling adventurous enough to try Cajun, I went for the dogs.  The Igby dog I gleefully munched was spot on - the acidity and fresh crunch of the coleslaw balanced well with the richness of the blue cheese and the sweet tang of the BBQ sauce.   It was just messy enough to be satisfying without making you look like a sloppy fool while milling around the lot.  And chasing it with local prickly pear soda = heaven.  It was a satisfying meal and not too expensive for the quality delivered.  Their menu is well-rounded, always important for a food truck since the menu needs to be small.  With five combinations of toppings, all with wildly differing flavor profiles, six choices of dog, plus the build-your-own option, there is something for everyone.  Their meat dogs are from Schreiner's, so you're golden with any choice you make there, and there is a veg option, as well, which I will never, ever be commenting on.  They also have a special of the day dog, which you'll have to arrive early for, since the devotees generally gobble them up.  And more power to them - the special I saw on the board looked amazing, and I was sorry I had missed it, having arrived an hour and a half into service.  The only reason I am daring to knock a star off this rating is that there is one tiny thing that needles me: the bread they use.  Don't get me wrong, the flatbread is delicious, inventive, and conducive to a not-too-messy eating experience.  It's a crucial part of their style of hot dog, and Short Leash's followers are nuts about it.  But...for me, I felt that they have a slight packaged quality to them that reminds me of Trader Joe's, which is not a horrible by any means, but it leaves me craving something more....  I can't help but wish they would add just one more option of bread/bun - in my opinion, a pretzel bun would make a killer addition.  Short Leash Dogs is a gem in the food truck scene and is absolutely not to be missed by local foodies.  I'm looking forward to trying all of their combinations in the years to come.",

I opted for the Chicago dog, a classic. It was fantastic and served in True chicago style. I chose the chips over the salad (worth it) and got a cheerwine as my drink. They also had many other \"vintage\" soda options. Didn't get dessert, but they had a ton of delicious looking doughnuts. Will be back here at some point to try more on the menu.",

    "text": "Finally saw their truck at The Willo Home Tour event. And I was hungry so I got two dogs: a regular wiener with coleslaw, Swiss and thousand island dressing. The other was called the \"Bear\" and seemed to be named a \"7th inning stretch favorite\" since it included peanut butter, Cracker Jacks and nuts. both very good but would've been better with melted cheese. The warm flatbread is a great touch and allows more toppings to surround the dog.  Service was friendly and efficient. I'll be keeping them on a short leash in the future...and look forward to trying more of their concoctions!",

It was really good! I loved it. The inside of the restaurant is your standard modern hipster look. I like the menu layout, easy to follow and choose. Definitely will be back.",

And if you can get to Tempe, you can get a better hot dog for half the price at Ted's. I guess this is a hipster place, and if you are not a hipster, it is not for you.",

Today we went to their sit down location because we were in the area and what a disappointment. The waitress brought us water but never asked if we wanted something else to drink. Brought kids waters 20mins into service. We asked for a high chair twice and ended up having to get one ourselves. It was not busy. We were one of four tables (others each were only 1 person). Food took forever. My hush puppies were awesome. Corn dog poppers great. Never offered ketchup only mustard. The Aoki is normally my fave but the mango chutne was actually just a mashed up mango. No flavoring. Before it was almost like a chopped salsa. The mango was so fresh before but this tasted canned. Also the mixed green side was under seasoned and wilted. I almost sent my meal back but never had a waitress check on us so it was pointless. We sat for almost 15 mins with cleared plates and finally got our check. Took another 15 mins to close out. Asked for lolly pops for the kids and she rolled her eyes and then brought them out after mentioning it again.   Again I love their food truck. And their hush puppies and fried green tomatoes were great but the service and Aoki was so disappointing.",

Talk about service with a smile.And, as a vegetarian that loved hot dogs in my past life, it is wonderful to have so many tasty options in one spot to satisfy me and my meet loving husband. The Igby is my personal fave, or was, until I tried the Bear. Served on delicious pita-like flatbread, it is covered in peanut butter, gouda and cracker jacks.......OMG!!! Had one Saturday and going today for another. Yeah....that good! Also, try the fried pickles! The fried pickles are a delicious side to the interesting dog combos they offer.   I can't say enough phenomenal things about their unique take on hot dogs or the flavorful concoctions they have come up with......My mouth is watering and yours should be too.

They did make us an order right away.  The Hot dogs were good. The Moki is like a bite of chili on your Hot Dog, kinda.  :)  I like that the offer so many toppings. Lot's of interesting ones, peanut butter? lol.   They also offer different hot dog choices, including a veggie dog!!     I would like to try the Olive Combo next.

The food is good, and they have interesting menu options.  Everything from saurkraut and swiss to peanut butter and bacon.  They also sell a hand battered corn dog, coleslaw, fried pickles, and kettle chips.  A highlight are the fried pickles.  They are great by themselves or as a topping on your dog.  I was underwhelmed by the coleslaw--It was good, but not great.  If the coleslaw had more flavor, and the batter on the corn dog was a little sweeter, I would give this place a solid 5.  4 stars ain't bad though.  I will definately be back to try the \"Bear.\"  Bear (7th inning stretch) Peanut butter, cracker jacks, smoked gouda, bacon and BBQ sauce.  It takes stones to have something like this on your menu, and perhaps equal stones to order it.  I love it when a solid business has a challenging menu item for the public to wax and wane over trying.",

The venue is small but cool and we will definitely come again.   I had the Bear and my daughter had the Lady. We ordered two sides of the fried pickles but the server shared that the restaurant serving size was larger than that of the food truck so we changed to one order to share (kudos to the server!).   Sadly, our food did not live up to our experiences with the food truck. Perhaps it was an off day or the hour (late afternoon, between typical lunch and dinner). We both though the flatbread in our dogs was dry and tough and wondered if it had been sitting out. Likewise the fried pickles were off a little and not as crunch nor tart as those we get from the food truck. I am a huge fan of the local beer and they had a good selection and mine was fresh and cold.   We have gone to the food truck a number of times since visiting the Sit and Stay location and have continued to be thrilled with the food from the food truck. I am thinking we caught them in the brick and mortar on a bad day or at a bad time. For that reason, and because the customer service was excellent at Sit and Stay, we will definitely be back at least one more time.",

It had a nice crisp skin and it truly was a great tasting dog. They have a ton of toppings to choose from, and I liked the combination of the Moki. I also liked the fact they have several options to choose from for their dogs. And they had a great selection of 'old school' soda.   A+ for service! While there was a huge line and they were definately working very hard and on a sunny spring day - the service was extremely friendly. I was not a fan of the pita bread, it was very good bread, I just would prefer my dog on a roll. I also thought the price was reasonable - $5 for the dog. (I didn't get a drink, I didn't see the selection of soda until after I had paid and I didn't want to hold the other people up, there was a huge line that day).   A+ for presention. It's not just a dog slapped in a pita - it's neatly placed and rolled in the pita with a toothpick and pickel (check out my pictures).  I am looking forward to trying their other selection of dogs!

I love the tap wine selection; 4 different wines.  There are also 4 craft beer selections.  We ordered the Moki, which was a delectable mix of beans, tomato, mayo, cheese, and a few other yummy items on a bratwurst, all enveloped by the best \"bun\" I have ever eaten around a hot dog.  It was more like a thick tortilla.   It was warm and soft and pillowy.   The chips that came with it tasted like they had just been made in house.

Knowing that Short Leash has a cult following and others would probably be lining up to eat here too, we came early at about 5:30. I'm so glad we did because by the time we left at 6:45pm, there was a wait almost out the door!   The hot dogs are exactly what you would expect: delicious Schreiner's sausages sandwiched between fresh Naan with a variety of different delicious ingredients on top. There are several unique hot dog entrees to choose from and you can also build your own dog. We started with the corn dog bites which come on skewer sticks and are accompanied by a ranch and a spicy sauce. The corn dogs are amazing; freshly made corn dog batter and cheese infused sausage. For my entree, I decided to go with a class Short Leash special, the Sunny which is a chicken sausage with grilled fruit, goat cheese, prosciutto and arugula. It's one of my favorite hot dogs and the perfect combination of ingredients. Besides the hot dogs that made them the local celebrities they are today, this restaurant has some new additions to the menu including salads and sliders. They also have beer on tap so you can have a beer with your dog!   As for the environment, it's very neighborhood friendly. Everyone is encouraged to be friends while they eat and this is reflected by the communal tables. Be prepared to dine with a couple strangers (who might become new-found friends!) if you come during peak hours. If you don't feel like taking the chance to have to dine at a communal table, then I suggest that you eat at the bar. It's simple sophistication inside with a cool feel to it. Brad and Kat's friendly personality comes to life as Brad welcomes you inside while Kat cooks up a storm in the back.   I am so happy that this successful food truck has turned into an adorable restaurant. Their food, service and charm has rolled over nicely into their new restaurant! I will happily return again soon to get my Short Leash fix.   *****  After dining on our hot dogs, we headed next door for a piece of pie from another food truck success story, Mamma Toledo who opened up The Pie Hole next door. Look for that review coming up next!",

    "text": "Last night was the grand opening of Sit....Stay the sit down restaurant for Short Leash Hot Dogs. I have only had Short Leash one time before this at a UYE that Jon H. hosted. From first bite I was in love. So much more than just a regular hot dog. Then I heard that this restaurant was opening, I was super excited. Had to show up for the first day. So did a lot of other people but that is a good thing. When I got there I muscled my way inside and got my name on the list. I was told the wait would be about an hour and a half. That is understandable. First night. Ton of people. The place is not that big. Nice cozy spot. So many people it took me awhile to realize there was a bar as well as tables. I thought it was just a bunch of people standing in one corner. The wait was awesome. Best wait for a table at a restaurant I have ever had. The owners were also running around handing out hot dog pops. Little corn dogs on sticks some with Jalapeno cheese in them. It was a surprise as to which ones did. Also the nicest girl was handing out waters and refilling them for those standing around. She had the best attitude, I think, ever for someone filling up water glasses. As busy as it was she was super happy and excited to be refilling water. Plus she was genuinely happy that you had shown up. The owners were very nice too. Everyone was. So after my awesome time of waiting I finally got called. Felt like I won something. Got seated at a table with several other people in various stages of their meals. Again understandable with so many people. Waiter came over, also very nice, took drink orders. Nice girl with the water showed up again. The menu is changed slightly from the food truck menu. All the regular dogs are there and you can build your own. Plus they have new entrees and salads. You can also order pitchers of beer which is great and they have Kilt Lifter on tap another plus. Had a little trouble picking which dog I wanted. So many great choices. Finally got the Bear. Which has the oddest list of ingredients that you would think would not work at all but it just does. Peanut butter, cracker jacks, smoked Gouda cheese, bacon and BBQ sauce. Crazy right? But soooo good. The fact that all of their dogs are served on naan bread pushes it over the top. Drinks took awhile coming out. Again no problem. I love the little tin trays they bring the food in. All dogs are served with chips or a garden salad. It was one of the best meals I have had in a long time and the hot dogs were really good too. This place is awesome. If you go here and just get a plain old mustard and sauerkraut dog you are doing yourself a disservice. Also don't miss out on Mamma Toledo's pie shop. Hidden in the corner. Turn left instead of right when you head towards the bathrooms. They will Shut Your Pie Hole. Didn't try the pies but the cookie bars were really good. If they are any indication the pies should be great. I had an awesome time. No one else can have as awesome of a time here as I did, it is impossible, but you will get a great hot dog though. The best around. Even if you have to wait for it trust me it is very worth it. There is a reason there is a wait. They are that good. Your mind might just be blown. It is possible.  This place has the possibility of becoming very special for me but that is just me. Only me. I don't want to build it up too much for everyone else.",

These guys truly represent what local business is all about: they serve up a unique, high quality product and it is obvious that they love what they do.  The unique, high-quality product to which I refer is of course hot dogs. But not just hot dogs. They have brats and a choice of different wieners.  I prefer to build my own so I went with the all beef wiener with sauteed onions, mushrooms, bacon, tomato, bleu cheese and chipotle mayo served on flat bread. SO good. They also have their own creations which are pretty unique and creative.  What's nice about Sit....Stay is that they have a nice little bar with draft beer and wine. They also have an expanded menu that includes appetizers and salads as well as some entrees like Polka Dot casserole and Pig in a Blanket which both sound awesome.  The people that work here are all super nice as well and that is what makes me happy to spend my money here and support this business. Definitely worth checking out and supporting. They are close to where I work so I see myself in here often for lunch.",

    "text": "I've unearthed hot dog Nirvana!  I've been Yelping on and off for about nine months and during that time never --- I say NEVER ---  have given five stars to any restaurant.  Much to my surprise and delight, I've found the perfect quick serve meal in the most unlikely of places: a food truck!  The local food trucks and specifically, Short Leash, have had their fair share of \"ink\" recently and I'm so glad my curiosity got the best of me.  The long line in the hot Phoenix weather during last week's Food Truck Friday was long forgotten once I bit into a \"Regular\" (pictured) with \"Lady\" toppings.  The hot dog was cooked to perfection with it's slightly crispy casing and flavorful meatiness.  I had no idea it would be served on naan, but loved the soft, light freshness of it all.  And the toppings?  The Lady includes Chipotle Cream Cheese, sauteed Onions and fried Pickles ... all of which created a wonderful combination of flavors, though did not overpower the flavor of the meat.  I was so impressed with Short Leash that I made a point of visiting again THE VERY NEXT DAY!  This time it was The Chicken (pictured) with Aoki toppings (Mango Chutney, diced Jalapenos, Red Onions, fresh Cilantro and Mayo) which blew me away.  Whoever came up with these flavor combinations is a genius!  And as for the staff, let me just say that they are genuinely THE nicest people around or deserve an Academy Award.  (And remember, they're working hard in the heat, ya know!)  Thank you, Short Leash, for doing it right.  I'll undoubtedly be back for more hot dogs --- and smiles.  But don't worry, I won't complain about the long line.  ;)",

Short Leash is known for their funky combinations/toppings but have no fear... they are just as complex and delicious as they are strange. My personal favorite is the Devil Dog (green chiles, jalapenos, sriracha, onions) but when vegetarian chili is available the Mac Daddy (mac n cheese & chili) is going to happen.  Congrats to the owners on such success!",

Our server was decent, not exactly friendly but not rude either.   We got fried pickles as an appetizer and were slightly disappointed as there wasn't much there. Maybe we were used to bigger portions but it seemed like they skimped out a bit. However, they were absolutely delicious.   I was a little upset when I saw the menu, for hot dogs these are some pretty high priced meals. Either way, I ordered the Bear Dog while my friends ordered the Devil Dog. I wasn't too sure the Bear Dog sounded good but it seemed to be popular so I thought I'd go for it. I was glad I did - somehow it works I promise! The dogs came with baked chips which I thought was great. They tasted good and were a nice change from the cliche fries.   My friends ordered doughnuts for dessert (I was too full) and were satisfied with them.   Overall, very unique place and I would recommend it to anyone going through Phoenix. However, quite pricey so keep that in mind if you're deciding where to stop.",

They have a hot dog called \"The Bear\".  it has bacon, barbeque, gouda (sounding good right...just wait this is the weird part), peanut butter, and cracker jack.  Okay now I am intrigued and stay with me people! I nervously waited in the endless line which included some weirdos who were not in the line just standing by it to confuse everyone.  I was still questioning this crazy concoction, but as an adventurous eater I had to try it.  When we FINALLY got to the front I ordered.  They did not have gouda, but no matter I order swiss instead.  They were also out of most of the types of hot dogs, but luckily I just wanted a regular anyway.  Then you stand in a line to wait for your food.  This was lots of time to second guess my sanity on this one, but I am glad I did not. The hot dog was REAL GOOD!  i took it over to where the band was playing (Blueshounds were also a really good addition to my hot dog experience).  WOWZA!  This thing was good!  The dog was served up in naan bread instead of the usual bun.  The salty sweet and spicy combo was unlike anything I have ever tasted and good too!  The peanut butter gave it a kind of pad thai taste and the cracker jack crunch sealed the deal.  This was a winner.",

While they do employee the tofu Smart Dog (which I previously have found bland), their take on how to dress the dog drove me to buy my own pack that same day.  They have very eccentric toppings, the themes of which are inspired by the personalities of their favorite dogs.  My husband, who is not a vegetarian really enjoyed their hand-breaded corn dogs.  I believe there are 4 (?) non-veggie dog/brat choices.  We are considering having them cater our next big event!!  We also plan on visiting them much more often and with our pups in tow.",

Every Wednesday during June & July (I think?) they are located at 335 W McDowell Rd (which is about a 2 minute drive from where I work) from 11am-1:30pm. My girlfriend Renee is in town for the summer so she met me there for some lunch & girl talk. We were warmly greeted by Brad (1 of the owners) & he explained it all since this was our 1st time. I decided on the Lady (chipotle cream cheese, sauteed onions & fried pickles) with a regular wiener, a bottle of good old fashioned coke & a corn pup for us to share. Renee decided on the weekly special Tyler (beef & bean chili, French's crunchy fried onions & cheddar cheese, sans the fried onions) with a regular wiener & a bottle of coke as well. We loved our wieners & the corn pup, so damn good! I loved that they used Naan bread instead of a bun, so clever! My only complaint was that I wished they used dill pickles on my wiener instead of the sweet ones. It was also a cute touch that they give you a lil dum dum sucker, brings me back to my childhood days. Total for 2 wieners, a corn pup & 2 bottled cokes was only $16 & some change, awesome deal. I will definitely be back!",

I had the special of the day, it was fresh and hot, served on soft warm flat bread that tasted like it was baked that morning.  I know they travel around the valley, the best location for me to catch them is the Urban Market downtown - they are there Saturday mornings, Wednesday evenings, and for lunch on Fridays.  Will be back this evening for round two!",

I always get the same thing--the dog with the sauerkraut--but everyone I've dined with has loved their selections too.  Ask the owners what combos they suggest for the various toppings.  They are incredibly nice and knowledgeable.  You will have to wait for your food longer than if you get a hot dog at Costco (which I also love), but it will be worth it.

    "text": "There is a reason why Short Leash Dogs is the Number ONE Phoenix metro-area food truck and there is a reason why you will often find them to be the only truck with a line at all.  They are CRAZY GOOD!!!  Gourmet local dogs on warm naan flatbread with unique toppings - who would have thought?  I am not typically an adventerous eater, but this is a MUST TRY for everyone!  My husband and I are crazy for Short Leash Dogs and we are satisfying our cravings now an average of three times a week!  Really!  I am smitten about an \"adjusted Lady style dog\" - I order a spicy beer hot Lady with pinto beans and green chillis.  Yum!  The spice of the chipotle cream cheese and the crunch of the fried pickles are perfect with the snap of the spicy beer hot.  Unbelievably good I tell ya!  My husband has tried all of the suggested combinations and frequently orders the Featured Dog of the Week.  He has loved them all.  We have only gone wrong when we tried to make up our own - they weren't bad at all, just not as good at Kat and Brad's creations. They have deep fried pickles.. the good kind!  They start with local fresh pickles, batter and fry them to order.  We always share a side!  If you have never tried fried pickles, this is where you need to try them.  If you have had them other places, this is where you need to go to get them!   We only tried our own creations at our first visit and have since left the culinary creativity to these professionals!  We follow their schedule on Facebook and are excited to see that they are adding more regular locations in addition to their Phoenix Public Market days/nights... You can find them at Urban Cookies at lunch time on Tuesdays now, Urban Beans for dinner on the 3rd Thursday of the month and now EVERY FRIDAY NIGHT at their own spot behind Frances & Smeeks (Central/Camelback) called SIT...STAY.   They have a little dining area set up and a fixed sample menu.  (We have been there every Friday since they started.)  Great way to try different options in an inviting environment that makes you want to visit, sit and stay!  We luva-luva Short Leash and enjoy bringing friends and out of town guests to experience the Phoenix vibe that they have helped to create.  Again, I am not an adventerous eater.  I expected a weenie, standard bun, mustard and kraut from a hot dog truck.  I am sooo glad that I didn't find that here and I gave it a try!!   I will never have a regular dog again and I won't miss it either!",

Alas Short Leash has surpassed even her expectations. Great service, fast, friendly, and too many variations on toppings to list.  I cant even pretend to know what hers was like because i greedily devoured mine ( the igby: coleslaw, bleu cheese, bbq sauce ) with reckless disregard for my fingers. Going to make it to Short Leash as often as possible....i only gave it 5 stars because i cant give it anymore.",

It sounded awful to me but \"living in the moment\" got the better of me.  The first few bites were interesting. After a while, I concluded that the cashier played a cruel joke on me.

The dog itself was from Schreiners and it was top notch.  So fresh and yummy!  I don't do well with chemicals and additives and this had none at all!  It was served on grilled naan with sauteed onions, fried pickles, and spicy cream cheese.    I was a little leery as I have not had a dog in at least 5 years and don't have the digestive power anymore but this went down really well.  The guys on the truck were very welcoming and helpful and I cannot recommend this truck any more highly.  Their menu is really diverse and has a lot of different option, including vegetarian.  This little company does SO many things well...give them a try, you won't be sorry!",

The donuts  are really good made from scratch and if this was just a rating based on the donuts they would get five stars. However, we ordered coffee  and breakfast. We ordered vanilla lattes and they were not very flavorful, in fact they kind of tasted like burnt beans (the espresso machine probably needs to be cleaned). That being said I am a coffee snob and love good coffee/espresso. The breakfast options are inventive. My husband rated his breakfast doughnut sandwich a 2 for taste and a 5 for creativity so over all 3. I had the breakfast wrap which was filling but almost too much like hotdogs and eggs I ate as a child. I would rate it a 3 for taste. The breakfast fries were a 5. I will definitely give this place another try b/c I like supporting the little spots and the donuts were amazing.",

When I asked if this was the Spicy Beer Hot dog to both the chef and the server, the response was a shrug of the shoulders.

    "text": "\"The noblest of all dogs is the hot-dog; it feeds the hand that bites it. \" - Lawrence J. Peter.  After having Short Leash numerous times at events around the valley, I finally gotten around to visiting their place and boy am I full!  Strolled in today after a dramatic parking adventure with Linh L. and we ordered a delicious meal.  Between the two of us, we had a root beer, a ginger ale, corn dog bites, the Igby, and the Sunny.  Our bill came out to about $30 before tip for the both of us.  Admittedly, it's a bit of a splurge for wieners on naan bread but hey, it's Friday, I paid my student loans, and I wanted some good eats.  It's always good eats with Short Leash!  The Bear caught my eye but I was thinking I wanted something with some greens.  That Sunny... pure bliss.  It had pear with some honey, prosciutto, goat cheese, arugula, cracked black pepper, with a chicken wiener on fluffy warm naan bread.  Savory-sweet [with a hint of bitterness from the arugula]  wins me over every time.  I think it's more than just puppy love...  Other yummy items that have crossed these lips:  The Bear, Mac Daddy, fried pickles, jalapeno poppers, the pimento cheese dip, and the brat-stuffed pretzel.  Yum!  Try to save room for their dessert items.  If I didn't feel like passing out right on the spot from that food coma, I would have loved to split the orange-glazed and pistachio doughnut or the maple and candied bacon.  Gimme gimme!  More reason to arrange lunch again with some friends, right?",

They were organized and they kept the wine chilled well too. I didn't get to try anything more from the menu due to time restrictions but the food I saw coming out looked great.  The idea of these event is to introduce new people to these places; I really enjoyed the food sample they offered at the event, the Spinach Artichoke Stuffed Pretzel Knots, however, upon reviewing the menu online, I don't see it even listed? Fail. I'd go back to this place just to get more of these - they were so good. Get these on the menu for goodness sake!",

    "text": "Rollover Donuts is the latest venture from Brad & Kat of Short Leash Dogs!  Housed in the former Shine Coffee location, they have freshly made donuts and outstanding coffee! The coffee is amazing, and you can get anything you can think of, from a fresh drip, to salted caramel latte.  While the coffee is great, the doughnuts are the stars of the show.  Try the chocolate chip cookie dough doughnut- it will knock your socks off- so wear two pairs! I also tried the chocolate iced with walnuts, and it was sooooo good.  These doughnuts are brioche based, so they are different than old school cake donuts, but in a really good way, much like fancy wood fired pizza is different than more pedestrian types of pizza.  As with the other Short Leash ventures, Rollover Doughnuts has an outstanding since of community. It's really cool to be in the sixth biggest city in the country, and it feels like a small town. Brad, Kat, & Co. go out of their way to make you feel welcome and comfortable, and its a very nice touch.  Long live Rollover Doughnuts, another great reason why Phoenix is a great place to be.",

The one issue it still does not solve is: is a hot dog and chips worth $8.50  In a hip urban down town spot which was the easily forgotten tedybertos is Short Leash sit and say, what happens when a food truck graduates to a food storefront.  There are a few bar seats, several 4 person tables and a larger table to accommodate small groups.   The menu consists of hotdogs with unique toppings server on naan bread, and some other items, and even a few dinner only items. There is beer and even a local little it shop to the side.  I oped for a veggie dog in the seasonal style with a roasted pablano and pumpkin cream. I was skeptical but it worked well. I think the veggie dogs them selves could use a bit more character however.  The chips were home made and quite good, maybe the addition of a seasoned salt or aoli would be nice.   If you want to flex your hipster muscles and show off to a guest take them here, then cruize the hood on your fixie as there are a few other spots to grab a drink near by.",

    "text": "I've been going to their old location for years downtown before it closed, and have always enjoyed their fancy hot-dogs.  I mean, each one is pretty awesome and fairly priced at $8.  I've even had them come out with their food truck to my work location to serve up some great grub to co-workers!  I hadn't been to their new location though.  As an example of how amazingly talented this chef team is and how great this little restaurant is in terms of how it treats its customers and run it's business, on Valentine's Day they did a special appreciation cocktail dinner for an embarrassingly low price that ran in the face of every other operator serving bland food for inflated prices on the Holiday.  That's how you create love from your customers, and I applaud them!  While they may not be ready for a Michelin star, each course was phenomenal and honestly shows them to be on par with many of the great kitchens in the Valley, from St. Francis to many others.   Clearly a talented chef that rose to the occasion when allowed to get creative with this menu!   I mean... seriously... I would easily pay $8-15 for each of the courses they served.  They were amazing.  Anyway, I'll be back with the family for future meals, as their menu looks great.  The cocktails were all delicious, their beers are frankly inexpensive to fairly priced, they have daily specials that are better than many restaurants, and their new space is beautiful.  Lots of games to play while enjoying some good food.  I'd thank the owners for one of the best Valentine's Day meals I've ever had, and encourage anyone to come here for a $8 fancy hot dog with mind-blowing toppings, $8 apps, $9 pitchers of microbrews, or dozens upon dozens of different canned beer options.  And just auto-sign me up if you do any future special tasting menus!",

Which is a hot dog, smothered in gravy, served with French fries and cheese curds all wrapped up in a flat bread. It's probably not going to show up on any heart healthy menus but boy was it delicious.  Very flavorful gravy, which is not always an easy task.   For dessert we had a chocolate chip cookie dough donut which was delicious but a little stale. Flavor was good so I bet it's amazing when it's fresh out of the oven. The spicy Thai coconut donut was delicious. A great blend of sweet with some heat coming up the back.   There's lots more delicious sounding dogs and donuts that I will be back to try!",

They have so many possible combinations for hot dogs that I'd be surprised if you could not find something that you like.  Very vegan-friendly. They have a vegan veggie dog and vegan veggie chili. Although their quirky Naan bread used as the hot dog bun contains egg and milk, they have a more-than-satisfying pretzel bun that they make in-house free of animal products.  I ordered the Chili Dog with the veggie hot dog on a pretzel bun, no cheese, and added Fritos. I needed a fork and several napkins, but this meal was mind-blowing. The chili consisted of lentils, (at least) three beans, pickle slices, and carrots - very delicious, only thing I'd change is a little more spice. The Fritos were the perfect addition, although the pretzel bun was so thick and filling that it would've been just fine without them.  Unfortunately, since it was a work outing I did not dive into the craft beer selection, but hope to return at a later date to enjoy the drinks and the games (foosball, pool, Uno, and several other board games)! The food, atmosphere, artwork, knowledge of dietary preferences, willingness to accommodate, and service were all on point.  Highly recommend and definitely will return.",

(Focused heavily on craft beer) They have specials every day of the week. (Whiskey Wednesdays!) And of course, the hot dogs are out of this world. We tried the Poutine and Cubano dogs... still happy and full 4 hours later! We also tried the mac n cheese, which melted in our mouths. Best lunch we've had in a long time!  I'd also like to mention how incredible the owners were. Not only are they the creative minds behind the menu, but to me, they are the face of the company. Very kind, humble people who brought such an amazing concept to the neighborhood and Phoenix overall. As Phoenix continues to grow and revamp, this company and their owners will continue to be a staple in the community. I cannot wait to go back! Thank you, Short Leash!",

I've eaten way more of those than I probably should have. As far as the hotdogs - I've tried and liked the Crispy Dog, Monika, Devil Dog and Bear (I wasn't sure about that one, but it's really good!)",

I was a little scared because of the wacky food combos, but decided to be adventurous and give it a try. While waiting, they had uno cards on the table so we played that until the food was ready. The food came out in a cute little tray. It was pretty hefty and boy was it good. I'm not a big fan of bbq sauce but the sauce mixed with peanut butter is pleasantly good. They offer a variety of unique hotdogs thatll explode your tastebuds! I'll definitely be back to try out their donuts  Their doggy wall of fame is also very cute",

My friend had told me just how good the hot dogs this truck offers are & he wasn't kidding! He had the Oliver; I had the Igby. We each got an order of 2 Roll Over donuts: Cookie Dough & Chocolate with sprinkles.   I am not a sauerkraut fan at all but my friend is & loved his Oliver. He has ordered that one a few times now since he likes it so much. I really enjoyed the Igby. It has great flavor and with the coleslaw, barbecue sauce, & bleu cheese, the blend of flavors was heavenly!   The Roll Over donuts were okay; a bit sweet for my liking, but good nonetheless.   I will DEFINITELY do Short Leash again! You guys have not seen/heard the last of me or my friend Mark.",

Portions are quite large- we shared fries and each got a hot dog and were stuffed by the end. It looks like they have an incredible beer list but we stuck to water while we were there. Plenty of parking around the area so you shouldn't have trouble there. It looked like carry out was also very common so if you need to grab something quick or to go you are in luck!

FRITOS...*drool*...  I couldn't decide! Seeing my dilemma, and not being too busy at the moment, they offered to do half of each the Aiko and this daily special.

Whether u want spicy, savory, or something completely bananas they have it. I got the bear dog which had peanut butter, BBQ sauce, bacon, gouda and cracker jax. Sounds weird, tastes awesome. Also, the fried pickles are pretty bomb, albeit a little more sweet than sour (if you're really into sour pickles you've been warned). The chips that came with my dog (which I chose over a salad, duh) were the only shitty part. They appeared homemade and we're warm but really needed salt or some kind of flavor, besides dull potato. But who cares, fuck chips!   I'll definitely be back, although I wish the prices were a little lower for a hot dog place (8.50!) Probably create my own dog next time from their endless list of options. Live down the street, two thumbs up.",

Our server was very nice and made sure to point out the featured hotdog for the day, which was an Italian sausage with bolognese sauce . We ordered one, as well as the Oliver to share. So good! It was easy enough to split each hotdog for sharing, and we each got the delicious chips. We both also enjoyed the atmosphere and friendly staff.

    "text": "++fried pickles, shepherd's pie special, local beer on tap, patio - - currywurst (the worst)  Things started out well. There were two of us, and we sat on patio. Waitress couldn't remember everything on tap (only a few) but offered to bring a sample of the type of beer I was interested in. We ordered the fried pickles, which were excellent - sweet pickle, savory batter and dipping sauces. The portion was large for two people (I think four could split it and be satisfied).   So many items on the menu sound interesting. I ordered the currywurst.  This was described as knockwurst slow cooked in a tomato & onion curry sauce served in a flatbread bowl with a mixed green side salad. It is basically just as described (except the bread was flat, not in a bowl shape) but it tasted pretty awful. It was like slightly watered down tomato paste with a little onion and sliced hot dog on top of some naan, oh and some curry powder sprinkled on top. The sauce was so thick and plentiful, you could barely see the wurst slices. I ate about half the bread under the sludgy sauce and fished out the wurst. I had to remind the server that brought my dish (not our waitress) that it came with a side salad. It tasted alright, nothing special.  The person I was with went with the featured special - shepherd's pie dog. It came with a side of chips. I tasted it and found it to be what I was thought I would get from this place - an unexpected and impressive twist that completely worked. My dining partner wasn't expecting much from the restaurant but was sold upon biting into this. He was already planning a repeat visit. I wish I had ordered this as well, but, b/c this was our first visit, I wanted to try different things in order to get a feel for what was on offer.   I really hope the currywurst is the only miss on the menu. I wish I had noticed the other yelp reviewer who panned it and ordered something else. I also wonder if anyone does like this or if the cook just didn't do it right (given it didn't look like the photo short leash has of it on a website and that the salad was forgotten).",

    "text": "Overrated.  I got one of the \"supreme\" hotdogs or whatever which was a dollar more ($9.50ish).  It sounded good, brat cooked in beer, covered with saurkraut and bacon.  The brat was as big as a pointer finger and the pretzel bun was slightly larger than a dinner roll.  So picture pig in blanket with much larger roll and a pig that's just a little bigger.  Not proportional, and kind of messy - people get this off a truck and are able to eat it without a fork and knife??  The pita bread with pimento cheese was actually very good, however, the bread was SO greasy.  We were thinking we should go back for this and beer, but realized its probably not a great idea.  Maybe the dogs off the truck are a little bigger?  It would definitely have to be several dollars cheaper for this to work..  The beer selection was pretty good though and value priced.",

Many times, being seated has been an ordeal, the service is slow, they haven't had the soda I want, the wait staff is extremely awkward and they seem really anti-social. They are not overly welcoming.  I always come back for the food, but my biggest and most recurring complaint is the service. Considering the food combinations are based off of different hot dogs and sausages, in my opinion it takes a little longer than I think it should, especially with the service itself.   Otherwise, it's a great new, unique place with great food. I have never tried the food truck, but have never heard any complaints about the food.   They also have a good selection of \"hipster\" drinks, local products and alcohol, if I remember correctly.",

We saw several catering trucks parked at a farmers market on Wed night and popped in.  So glad we did! I had a dog with mango chutney and other yummies.  Serving them on flat bread... Genius!!!! My brother ordered the corn dog.  The breading actually tasted like corn!  The owners couldn't have been more friendly and outgoing.  When they told us of their breakfast dog on Sat mornings....  We happened to still be in town on Sat and it was a given that we'd be going back!  Breakfast was insane!!!!  We took one to go for our family at the hospital.  All in all, utterly fantastic. If I should be in Phoenix again, you can bet I will make it a point to seek out Short Leash!  Thanks again, -John from San Diego",

Our group had everything from the Bear dogs, Pretzel dogs, Polish dogs, fries, and mac and cheese. They tasted a variety of the beers as well. It was all delicious and the whole group raved about the food, atmosphere, and the staff! Because it was a book club we stayed there longer than a typical dinner and everyone was so gracious and kind about the length of our stay. At the end of the evening we even had the opportunity to taste their donuts and they were delicious too! I appreciate the hospitality and wholeheartedly recommend the short leash!",

Just so you know, there is not a lot space in the restaurant or parking lot. I had to use a meter down the street, but don't worry, meters downtown take credit cards.

    "text": "Sometimes in life you just need a bratwurst stuffed pretzel loaded with sauerkraut, bacon, swiss cheese and some sweet , sweet bavarian mustard to make a lousy day better.. oh and maybe a side of loaded fries and a doughnut to top it off with.  Now this may seem like a bit much for one person to eat, but I promise you, it totally was.  Yet, I could not help myself.        The combination of juicy bratwurst absored into a soft, warm pretzel covered in melted cheese and sauerkraut topped with a sweet yet tart bavarian mustard was too much to handle.  It was everything I had been waiting to eat but it left me wanting more.  After finishing it, I immediately regretted not having ordered another dog, but it was ok, because I had ordered some back up items.      Along with my main, I had an order of the loaded fries which consisted of crispy french fries covered in chilli, cheese, sour cream and japalenos.  The chilli was quite yummy and would have been good even on its own.  I would highly suggest this if you like your fries messy and delicious.  The next victim after the loaded fries was the orange glazed, chopped pistacio covered doughnut.  It was a light, airy, full flavored mess.  The orange glaze was not too sweet where my brain had to shut down due to sugar overload, but it was still upfront enough to let me know, I should only eat one.  The mixture of orange and pistacio was aromatic and very prominent in the taste.  The pistacios themselves gave a great texture, and really added that \"wow\" factor.        I really cannot find fault in my meal, it was freaking GOOD and I was completely satisified with it.",

    "text": "The C-Clan went to Sit-Stay on grand opening night.  We got there just in time as we took 2 of the last seats at the community table.  The wait was the better part of 1hr to get in afterwards.     We decided to order some corndog bites (though J wanted to order the Scotch Eggs) as a starter.  Mini versions of the jalapeno cheese corndogs...drool!    J's order - The Mac Daddy, which he raved about!  My order - A salad for which I can not remember the name.  Had grilled peaches, chicken sausage, and 2 slices of fried goat cheese.  Perhaps it was the Sunny?  Salad dressing was pretty non-existent.  Though the dog was flavorful, I probably wouldn't order the salad again.      Baby Cs order - Kids polka dot casserole.  A penne pasta with a cheese sauce and slices of hot dog.  Baby C enjoyed the pasta and bites of dog.    Other than my salad, the only thing that would make Sit/Stay better is if they had high chairs.  Baby C had to sit in my lap because unfortunately they only have booster seats.  Baby C is a too small for a booster.  And there's a big difference between going to a restaurant and having a 13month old sit in my lap vs visiting the truck at the Phoenix Public Market and having the baby lap it.   So hopefully they'll have a highchair or two by the time we go again, or maybe we'll just bring our travel highchair.  But all in all, it was a great experience!  We don't have to stalk, er, chase the food truck for our dog fix!  YAY!",

Eating a hot dog is generally associated with good memories from your childhood, from being at the ballpark, or out at the pool on the 4th of July. Why wouldn't one enjoy a good hot dog?? Maybe because no one is really sure what's inside of those Oscar Meyer weiners. If that's the case, I can understand your hesitation.  Enter: gourmet hot dogs. You get all the pleasures of hot dog nostalgia, sans the mystery meat, but with delightful toppings added on. Everybody wins!  My only \"beef\" if you will, is that I've had better gourmet dogs elsewhere. Not in Phoenix, but in my journey across the land. On this particular vacation, I had just come from Denver, where Biker Jim's set the bar incredibly high.  But I'd definitely return to Short Leash again!",

The most delicious and unique variety kind too!   Short Leash offers lots of different variety on plain hot dogs but their \"build your own\" takes the cake! I made my very own concoction of a spicy and savory veggie dog. I love coming here and trying another variation of it. It's definitely worth the 30 min drive! Every time I come, I have to double check that my hot dog is a veggie because it's that good. It doesn't even taste vegetarian. I ordered a salad for the side but I enjoy the chips better. The salad had a bit too much dressing for me.   The price is very reasonable too! On Sunday we came for brunch and ordered jalapeno poppers (homemade, none of that frozen stuff) a mimosa, Mexican sprite, two build your own dogs, AND two delectable donuts  all for under $40 bucks! I love this place. Thank you for existing and catering to us vegetarians. We really do appreciate it.  Now for the service: It's been very good so far. There was one incident where they gave me the wrong hot dog, real vs vegetarian, but they gave me a new one quick. My husband got my veggie dog and he didn't even notice due to the delicious flavors.   Definitely my favorite place to go eat hot dogs! Try it just once. You will not be disappointed.",

We are giant fans of the Bear, but today there was so much bacon and bbq sauce that it ruined the experience. Usually that wierd but wonderful mixture of peanut butter, gouda, bbq, bacon, cracker jacks, and spicy dog leave your taste buds awed, inspired, and feeling confused, however today they were crushed by the weight of the salty bacon. No finesse to the flavor combos, just a mass of bacon which when scraped off 2 bites in amounted to more than the hot dog and peanut butter combined! So we will come back but not sure if my husband will dare his beloved Bear again, at least not without saying light on the bacon. He also misses the crumbling of the cracker jacks from years past.  My crispy dogs were delicious though, as well as the fried pickles. The jalapeno poppers were tough though.",

While donuts don't fit in to the revolving office diet, at least I'm assured to have a delish sweet treat throughout the day.  Can't wait for their downtown location to open!",

You start with your type of dog and go from there. They had pre-made specialty combinations, or you could add your own personal toppings from their EXTENSIVE list of options.  I went with a spicy dog, sauerkraut, and mustard. Simple yet elegant, and these guys NAILED it.  Working on a food truck - no matter how GREAT your food is - it becomes boring. So we trade food with other trucks.  Let me just say this: I'm looking forward to seeing them again and getting a delicious hot dog - you should too.  Keep up the good work!!",

    "text": "Oh my gosh!!! You are unholy goodness! My favorite hot dog was the Costco Polish Sausage. I've had many other hot dogs, including those New York chili dogs, but this place makes them SUPER unique. My boyfriend and I walked in, looked at the menu, and both agreed to order three to share. We weren't even that hungry!  What we had: -The Sunny: This was our favorite. It's such a refreshing combo of light ingredients. The chicken is amazing, do yourself a favor and do NOT substitute it with any other type of hot dog meat. The pear that was in there gave it some nice crunch and freshness. SO unique. SO GOOD. Will 100% order again. -The Bear: At first I wasn't sure what I was eating. It is a 'salty' dog (doesn't mean that it's too salty though, but that the flavors were more geared toward that). I was really unsure about the Cracker Jack popcorn, but it actually gave it a nice crunch without being distracting! The BBQ sauce gave the entire dog some zest and the peanut butter worked really well with the bacon. It wasn't at all overwhelming. -The Poutine: Very savory. I like the balance of gravy and potatoes. Though it was good, it was my least favorite out of the three. Would I never recommend it? No. I think it was just overshadowed by two other really outstanding hot dogs.  1000% will eat here again!  Also, the nice cashier guy raved about their donuts. I don't even like donuts, but he gave us the last cookie dough donut and IT WAS AMAZING!!!",

I didn't realize they had such a great beer/cider/wine selection either! Mostly canned, but they have a lot that I want to try :)   We got similar hotdogs - he got the Monika and I got the Crispy Dog (the Monika minus the bacon) - and they were so good! $9 seems a little expensive for a hotdog until you see how huge they are, and for both of these hotdogs you even get two! We both loved them, they were spicy without being too spicy, and a hotdog fried in a corn tortilla is super unique and actually really good.   I of course got a donut on the way out which was good, too! Not the best old fashioned cake donut I've ever had (it didn't seem like a cake donut to me and was kinda doughy in the middle still), but one I would eat again for sure! I'd love to try some more of their fun flavors, I just wasn't feeling any they had left that day.   We also got one of their homemade treats for our puppy, and he loved it! I can't wait to bring him to the restaurant and sit on the patio when he's older. It looks really nice out there :) the inside is really cute, too!",

I did lol I also ordered the fried green tomatoes, I love fried green tomatoes but these just didn't do it for me. Not that it doesn't have potential to be delicious because it does, it's just sliced too thick for my liking. They have an outside covered patio with misters which is great! I had my dog with me outside. If it's not service it can't come it, but you can place the order from outside, they will work with you! I would definitely suggest coming here and hanging out And grabbing some good food!",

Their employees are all SUPER friendly... like no joke... As for the food, the price is very worth it for the quality and taste. I got their oliver hot dog and it was served with naan instead of a traditional hot dog bun. I LOVE NAAN so I think that using it as their bread is GENIUS. It was very tasty and filling, and I will definitely be back again!   I saw some of their doughnuts and that is also one of the things that's in my list to get from their menu as well. They looked so tasty and appetizing!   Oh and they also have treats available for doggos, which I thought was pretty neat! Anyways, A+++++ restaurant all around for me, and I cannot wait to bring my boyfriend, family, and friends in one day with me!",

The place is a medium size inside with a fairly spacious patio (which will be great during the fall-spring season).  They have some games, regular seating and bar seating.  The ladies that greeted me and took my order were friendly.  I opted to try the BEAR - with an all beef hot dog and it contained peanut butter, smoked gouda, bacon, BBQ sauce, cracker jacks and added a side of deep fried pickles.  Interesting combination but hits all the sensations for the palate and it works well together.  The pickle were fried with a light batter and still fairly juicy.  Just a word to the wise, not sure if their AC was out or if they only have evaporative/swamp cooler.  I was not comfortable (heavy and sticky), but that could just be me.  Don't get me wrong, I will be back, but might wait until the monsoon season is over...",

The choice of using the flatbread instead of a traditional hot dog bun makes a lot of sense to hold all the toppings.  I got the Cubano and it was covered with so many toppings it was almost too much food for me.  My boyfriend got one that was unexpectedly amazing: hotlink, bbq sauce, peanut butter, smoked gouda cheese, and topped with cracker jacks! The person in front of us in line vouched for it so he got it and we were all impressed with how well it came together.  We finished our meal by splitting a doughnut. It was tasty but we were disappointed by the lack of selection by the time we arrived around 1 PM.",

I stopped in the other day. The Chicago dog was delicious as always.   My friend tried the Cubano and I took a huge bite of it (much to his dismay). I think he won lunch, the Cubano was out of this world and what I am getting when I crack again on my way home from yoga.  As though inhaling one huge dog wasn't enough I also got the fried pickles. They were good, but almost a bit too sweet. I washed it all down with a Mexican coke and drove home basking in my guilt.",

First of all the food is awesome, they have fantastic hot dogs that you can have vegetarian.  They are really good veggie dogs if you are a vegetarian.  They have an awesome selection of starters including Cauliflower buffalo wings, which are totally amazing and out of this world.  The beer selection is fantastic and if you go for happy hour the prices can not be beat. I sat at the bar and the service was also top notch. The owner was there and talked with us for quite a while, just adding to the great experience. The building has plenty of seating and also they have some foosball tables for fun. All I can tell you is stop in and try it out,  you will not be disappointed.",

    "text": "Short Leash Hotdogs is sort of a free-for-all of hot dog places in the sense that - well, pretty much nothing appears to be off limits. Many of their dog creations are unique and downright strange, but I'm pretty sure you're bound to find something that works for you.  I wouldn't go so far as to say that these are chef-driven creations. They're merely just creative takes on traditional dogs that are unlike anything else you're bound to find in Phoenix.   I ordered a Mac Daddy, which consists of mac and cheese, chili, and a beef dog that's stuffed into a naan-type bread as opposed to the traditional bun. My girlfriend chose the pretzel dog, which is wrapped in pretzel bread and allows you the option to choose between either cheese or mustard dip. Although since we weren't asked what we wanted, I guess cheese dip is the default.  Both dogs were fine, but addressing mine in particular and to channel another Yelp review, there comes a point where the toppings become less of a compliment to the dog and literally become the meal itself. It's a bit excessive, although there was indeed a dog buried deep within the mountain of mac and chili when I went searching.  The starter of pimento cheese and chips that we chose was fine. We both enjoyed the chips, while the pimento was average and nowhere near the level of the mind-blowingly great pimento you'll find at a place like LGO.  The doughnut = A disgrace.  I could care less about creativity when it comes to donuts. A great straight-up raised and glazed or traditional cake donut is all that's needed to win me over. Since neither of these options were available, my girlfriend chose a single vanilla glazed. I'm not sure what this thing was, but it definitely wasn't what we'd call a legitimate donut. It tasted like soft bread, somewhere between a croissant and an old biscuit. It was a big disappointment.   In summary, I see this as late-night drunken food that's incredibly heavy and something that I'd probably never eat regularly due to the wrath it might invoke on my sensitive stomach. On the plus side, I really like their wall of dog photos - because seriously, how can you not like it?  Recommended to try, but probably not for everyone.",

Sadly they only had one doughnut left which was really why I said yes when my fiance asked to go here but I took that classic doughnut and had them box it up and we ordered drinks so I was happy. The naan like bread for the dogs/brats etc were perfectly warm and soft yet with a little crisp to them. The portions and items where perfectly matched. I loved it so much I couldn't finish it all. The poutine fries would have been perfect if they put them under a salamander to melt the cheese and warm the gravy. I haven't been back yet but probably will at some point and when I do I will ask for them to do that which would probably make me want to come in even more. Great place, guy loved everything the brought and the doughnut we took home and shared made the night. It was an amazing doughnut! Ok, just writing this makes me want to go back.",

    "text": "I got some small gripes about this place. Overall I think its great though. I got a poutine dog and the bratwurst stuffed pretzel. I also tried a classic doughnut and doughnut holes.  The poutine dog was everything I love about Phoenix food. Different and interesting . The hot dog itself was majorly impressive in its own right. I actually loved the Nann bread as the \"bun\"  The stuffed bratwurst was a a major disappointment. The brat itself didn't seem that fresh and kinda gross. The pretzel bun was not salty at all. With the sauerkraut and the mustard which was super overpowering in the sweet department needed the pretzel bun to be salty. The cheese on it was good.    Maybe it just wasn't my style.  Now the doughnuts. The classic Doughnut has some \"weight to it\". Very cakey. No glaze just a homemade style frosting. They get points for their dounghnuts not tasting like every place in AZ. Though I definitely felt like these were 2 days old at-least. The doughnut holes which were chocolate had just the faintest chocolate flavor in the dough. No glaze just powdered. They also did not leave a oil aftertaste.   Will go back to try the mac dog. If I didn't get my order to go I would have asked to have my bratwurst comped because it was kinda gross.",

I mentioned the dressing error, and no fork thing and asked for only the check. She runs in the back trying to remake the salad, or repair the error, which took another 5mins.

I know, quite unusual from me, so yes, I was a little nervous! haha Small place with a full bar and huge beer list! Whats the story here? Gourmet-Simple Sausages! They have 3 types of Sausage(Beef Brat, Hot Beer Sausage, Chicken Sausage) served on a piece of Naan(Indian flatbread) They offer about 10 of their own creations as far as topping combos, but they also have a Build Your Own option with probably 25 different toppings to choose from.  I decided to go for their Special of the Day(Week maybe) which was Bleu Cheese, Bacon, Arugula. And chose the Hot Beer Sausage. It was delicious! Great flavor from the bacon and sausage, and the bleu cheese just brought it all together.  They also have another specialty here, Insane Donuts with a kiss of artistic flair!  I was so tempted by the dessert menu that I went for an Apple Fritter with caramel! It didn't disappoint at all!  While I was leaving, I noticed they also have a Food Truck! Actually, 2! One looked to be Donuts only and the other was much larger and seemed to be their Mobile Sausage Delivery Unit for the hungry people of Phoenix!  Check this place out if you want a modern twist on the age old Cased Meat!",

Kinky, cute idea you won't find any place else. Don't think this is some cheap hot dog place as 2 gourmet dogs, 2 beers, one fried pickles and one corn dog appetizer with tip came up to $45.  The corn dog appetizer is HUGE, so the son took it to his girl's afterward to share.   The fried pickles were great to me, so I'd come back just for that being the big fried pickle fan that I am....and darn, if it isn't hard to find good ones and these are good! Very good!!! They have a wide variety of canned beers for $3 which was fun to choose.  I got something peachy which was decent. This is a cute place for a date I think, however, I saw people here with little kids and for $8.50 a dog not sure if I would take little ones here.  Another adult, tho, you bet. The food is good, the service was great, the concept is beyond clever considering this place is a little tiny room with a minimum of decor.  Someone who owns this place is mighty clever as a marketer.  I admire them anyway for their creativity if nothing else and taking a very simple product (hot dog) and spiffing them up, serve a few good sides, cans of beer (no glasses, no washing) and charge healthy prices = clever. This one is a \"gonna return\" to....I really liked it overall alot.",

Placed our order, (Preztel dog and Mac Daddy bowl w/ Beef and beans) the scotch eggs were pretty good, not the best I've ever had, will have to come in and try them when they're fresher.  Entree's came out, one was spot on and correct, mine had to be returned to the kitchen as it was incorrect.  When it arrived, it was correct and very tasty.  The restaurant went above and beyond, imo,  to ensure that we were pleased with our meal.  It being a First Friday downtown would be why I expect the service was somewhat slow, they may have been understaffed or just swamped.  Server was very nice and I look forward to going back again.

The pita bread they use for the bun puts it above the rest. It's different for sure, but so worth the money. It's filling for sure!  They feature a dog of the week sent in by customers which is pretty cool.  I never thought anything gourmet could be sold out of a truck, but Short Leash proved me wrong!",

    "text": "Let me start by saying that I don't typically like hot dogs....honestly, I hardly EVER eat one. The only other place I will order a hot dog is at Pinks in LA or Vegas.  We tried Short Leash for the first time Thursday night. For the month of October they are parked at Jam Market in Old Town every Thursday from 4PM-8PM. Since they mainly set up shop in Central Phoenix and we live in Arcadia, we decided this would be our best bet!  Holy delicious. It was honestly one of the best things I've had in a long time. After drooling over the menu for a few minutes, I decided on the Aiko with a chicken dog. Brad was taking orders and when I told him I wanted to sub the mayo for spicy mustard, he was quick to offer up his suggestion of trying sriracha instead. I always appreciate when people give you their suggestions on what can make your meal that much better and the sriracha did just that...it was AMAZING. Now I like my food super spicy so I also added pepperoncinis and even got a little spicy mustard on the side.  Next up....fried pickles! These were awesome too! Thick cut and breaded perfectly! Now I'm a huge fried pickle fan (I like the chips VS the spears) and with not many valley spots offering up these tasty treats, I was super stoked they had them. I actually ended up dipping these in the spicy mustard...and sriracha. I know, I have problems.  Now my boyfriend on the other hand is a major hot dog fan, however, he typically doesn't stray too far from the standard hot dog with ketchup. Thursday night he decided to go with their featured special which was named after an adorable pup named Desi. This one came with a smoked Italian sausage, peppers, onions & garlic all slow cooked in a red wine tomato sauce and topped with shaved parmesan. He LOVED it. Cleaned his plate. I was somewhat skeptical of how he would like the naan that it comes on instead of a bun but it didn't phase him one bit!  Overall, we were two happy campers! The only thing I would love to see are french fries or tater tots gracing their menu!",

    "text": "I sought this out because Yelp caught my eye with it being on their \"Best of Yelp Phoenix Restaurants\" so I made a deliberate drive to get there, ate what I though was representative and think Yelp has this one wrong.  First of all Yelp, it isn't a restaurant that you claim but a food truck, a very small food truck.  But I had read the Yelp reviews and knew that.  I stepped up and had trouble finding the ordering line through the people.  While there wasn't a big group ordering, about 6 people were clustered around blocking the window, apparently waiting for their orders to appear.  Turns out it would be a long wait, but good things are worth waiting for, right? I sorted through those waiting, politely asked and found there was no line and made my way to the window.   I ordered the Beef Moki and because of the positive Yelp comments, added a side of fried pickle.  Total was $8 without a drink (I got one of the fruit drinks at the other trucks there).    Window guy said it would be about 7 mins, which caused me to look at my Droid - 1:22PM.   At 1:38PM my Moki arrived but there was a few minutes more wait for the fried pickle which wasn't ready yet.  Took 20 mins total and this was well past peak lunch hour.    Sat down and looked at what I got (see photos I took).  Other Yelpers are right, the dog is small. The Moki is listed as having green chilis, onions, tomatos, pinto beans, cheddar & mayo. I was anticipating a nice SouthWestern style blend of flavors, but that was absent.  I bit in and none of these flavors jumped out, no chili heat, no flavor burst, no taste of fresh veggies melding.   What I did get was a sensation of the tough skin texture of the dog, very thick naan bread and a pinto bean absorbtion.  Turning to the fried pickle, its breading kept falling off just leaving the limp, soggy pickle.  I finished the 7 pieces of fried pickle that I had paid $3 for and wondered why the ratings were so high.    The dining area I sat in was very windy, blowing fiercely which made the experience forced; a hand off between eating and holding down anything that I had ordered.  Hours later, my iron stomach is still getting belch tones from the dog's meat spices and oil based aromas.   This isn't good.  Unless you're working right across the street and this place was the utmost in convenience, I'd pass.  The flavors didn't work or even stand out, the service was incredibly slow, and the eating area was dumpy and windy.  Spending $8 for \"a dog and pickles\" then add an additional cost of a drink beyond that, you are already at sit down restaurant prices found elsewhere nearby.    I just don't see what the ravings are all about at this place.  Heck, I saw a Pita Jungle a few blocks before and wondered why I would pass that up to come here.  SIDE NOTE - I went back and read some of the prior Yelp reviews.  I just don't get how reviewers are giving this place such high ratings. Here is a review that rated 4 stars but stated it was only held back from 5 stars because;  -small dog,  -undercooked naan,  -toppings flavors don't fuse together,  -neglected service,  -overpriced <a href=\"http://www.yelp.com/biz/short-leash-dogs-phoenix#hrid:_FrRd1SiaPMV5-sIcTWu1A\">yelp.com/biz/short-leash...</a> wtf - Yelp, you've let me down.",

We started off with the Scotch Eggs that we all shared and I would highly recommend.  Delicious.  We all tried different hot dogs and all loved them.  I like that many are served on naan bread and others served on quality rolls.  The side I chose with my dog was the cole slaw and it was really good.  It's a mayo based dressing but not heavy.  Good beers and a friendly staff.",

My company sponsors a weekly \"Food Truck Wednesday\" event and ever since my first experience, I wait in anticipation to see if Short Leash Dogs will be there. Literally like a kid waiting for Christmas.   I ordered my own hot dog creation, I don't remember what was in it. But it was so good, I had to put the hot dog down after the first bite to make sure it was real.   I rarely eat hot dogs and I primarily consume them twice a year during a typical Labor Day or Memorial Day BBQ but I will travel for Short Leash Dogs. Yes, I said, Travel for a Hot Dog!

The first thing you will notice when approaching Short leash is their huge line, while virtually every other food truck doesn't have a line. Don't be tempted to leave. The lines are long- but completely worth it. Just a mustard dog kind of person? Don't be boring! Shortleash aren't just any hot dog...don't be afraid! My first glance at the menu, I was intrigued. Mango Chutney? Mayonnaise? hmmm...  After my first Short Leash- I was sold! I love trying their special of the day in order to try the latest and greatest concoction. I just had one that I still talk about that included a pretzal bun and apple cole slaw. Yum! Try it once, and you'll be hooked!",

Simple casual decor with a nice bar - seating for 8-10 and several tables, including a community table.   Started with the fried pickles, nomnomnom, and some local brews.   I ordered the veggie lady - such a simple thing, but I am seriously addicted. My husband ordered the spicy beer hot devil dog with a side of mango chutney and he loved it too.

    "text": "I will start with, if today was my first day ever eating here, I wouldn't come back.  I started coming to short leash almost a year ago and fell in love with The Bear, so much so that I always get it.  The way the crumbled cracker jacks meshed with the Gouda and the PB with the BBQ sauce with just enough bacon to sit up and say hello.  Something recently has begun to change.  It started with the Cracker jacks being not so finely ground and even som left whole which detracted from the flavor.  Then, they stopped even attempting to crumble then and just dropped whole ones on so that a when you take a bite you either get the flavor of The Bear or just a mash of either BBQ or PB depending on which was slathered on more that day.  The proportions were so different on some days that I couldn't finish it.  When you order a food based on playing off unique flavors, make sure all the flavors are always there or you muck up the experience.  Today, the dog was entirely bacon, not kidding, so much bacon that I felt like I was eating a bacon dog.  I love bacon, but I didn't want a bacon dog, I wanted that lovely mash of flavors that makes me smile.  This was trash.  With the ever changing formula of this flavorful dog continuously changing for the negative and a waitress that simply smiled when I voiced my concern I will have second thoughts before coming back.   I miss you The Bear, I hope we can meet again one day, but today was not that day.",

First off I will note I am vegetarian so I am only reviewing the veggie dogs but they were spectacular.  I had the Aiko ( Mango Chutney, diced Jalapenos, Red Onions, fresh Cilantro and Mayo + added sirracha), Igby  (Coleslaw and crumbled Bleu Cheese drizzled with tangy BBQ sauce) and we shared a side of fried pickles.  By far my favorite is the Igby and I wasn't that big of a fan of coleslaw before I had it even.  It's a perfect blend of crunchy, tangy, and sweet. The staff running the truck are extremely nice, friendly and very fun to chat with while I waited for the food. They made excellent suggestions so ask them what they think if you can't decide.  You are doing yourself a disservice by not tracking them down ASAP.  TRY: - Igby - Aiko",

    "text": "Friday night, not enough food left at home to feed 3. It's Friday! We all wanted something different, delicious (healthy is optional). Yelp to the rescue.  THE PLACE: It's right in downtown Phoenix; SE corner of 1st Street and Roosevelt. I've lived in the Greater Phoenix area for over 10 years, but I can't say I'm familiar with the history of the area. The vibe to me, up and coming, beatnik. Lots of graffiti on the surrounding walls by the parking lot that it shares with other small establishments. Not vandal type but the good kind of graffiti. More artsy if you will. The restaurant is not really big, but it has ample seating inside and plenty of outdoor seating.  The decor is very casual, with an industrial feel to it. Best part, right by the unisex restrooms is a wall of photos of dogs -- the barking kind. With endearing notes of who their loving mommies and daddies are.  Quite cool.  Oh, and before you take the correct turn to the restrooms, make the mistake of turning left and not regret it -- takes you to Mamma Toledo's Pies.  THE SERVICE: The server was friendly, helpful and happy to help with recommendations. The service was fast and efficient.  THE FOOD: I would recommend the Fried Pickles. Not a big fan of pickles? Don't knock it until you try it. Pickles tasted like they were a mix of sweet and dill dipped in delicious batter. Comes with 2 dips, ranch and chipotle. My daughter is a not a big fan of pickles, but you couldn't tell by watching her eat it. Hubby had the Mac Daddy -- mac n cheese, beef & bean chili, beef wiener. I had the Sunny -- grilled fruit, prosciutto, mixed greens, goat cheese, honey, chicken wiener. My baby girl had an Aiko - mango chutney, mayo and her selected wiener was a polish. What sets the experience a part?  All are served on Naan versus your traditional hotdog bun.  I looked at my plate of food, and thought I could have more than 1 for sure.  Not so much! It was surprisingly filling. I was getting full, but it sure did not stop me from savoring every morsel and making sure none of my Sunny was left behind.  Definitely, coming back -- I want to try the Oliver next :)",

Great, try the Crispy dog. 3 hotdogs filled with cheese and jalapeno, wrapped in in a crispy tortilla and deep fried. Even better, ask for it Monika style (wrapped in bacon) and a chipotle avocado cream sauce. The house made chips are a great pairing, and it about as good as it gets.

I was not very excited when I heard their would be a restaurant because I kind of like having to track down the truck and find them when I have a craving but the restaurant is amazing. I really love the new additions. The pig in a blanket and poka dot mac and cheese is amazing. I also really enjoyed the fried green tomato stack.   I don't understand the lukewarm reviews at all. The flat bread they use is amazing, I love that they have many hot dog options (and the veggie dog is amazing), as for the hipster vibe...well it is downtown but I am the farthest from hipster and have never been shunned so maybe something was going on or it was a fluke. I can't imagine anything like that ever happening. In fact, I am someone who gets forgotten. I am shy and I don't tend to talk to people I don't know yet Brad remembered my name, my order, and never stops being polite and accommodating.   Back to the food though. If you have not tried short leash you really need to! I don't even like hotdogs but I crave their hotdogs like nothing else. Also, they use local venders for pretty much everything and support our community better than any other business I have seen. It's really refreshing to see.",

And a portion size enough for two meals- or one if you're hungry. Good price, too. If they're busy, order one and shop around- it doesn't take too long anyway, but also gives you a chance to explore the rest of the Market. It's not on the menu, so ask for it!

A little too much for me, but that doesn't mean I would not, say, try another donut to see if it suits me better. I mean, you have to find the right one! The coffee was also good. Not bitter like some other establishments.",

    "text": "Ok, I admit I was skeptical when someone from the office suggested going here for lunch.  Just hot dogs, I asked?  But I'm a foodie, so I figured I'd try it.  Boy, am I glad I did.  I never saw so many exotic combos of dogs...not only toppings for them, but what was INSIDE them!  I wound up going for the more healthy turkey dog, with simply kraut and ketchup.  Wow, even that was great.  It was served on warm pita --genius---that was less bun to impede the flavor of the dog!  The dog was crispy on the outside and delish on the inside.  I got it with a little side salad, which is the option if you don't get their chips.  I also tasted their chips...quite good also.  The waitstaff were very helpful and explained all the different choices.  And if you have a sweet tooth, they offer their own doughnuts.  There is also a good selection of bottled drinks to accompany your dog.  If you like dogs or brats, you owe it to yourself to check this placed out!",

In fact, I've tried to recreate at home and I try to make it to the Short Leash Hotdog truck as often as possible.

Smooth and not too sweet, i.e. you can actually taste the coffee as opposed to just vanilla and milk. Plus they have both indoor and outdoor seating. Nice location, not a huge parking lot but there seems to be easy access to street parking. Right across from the Heard Museum and near a light rail station. I'm really impressed at how this neighborhood has grown and will definitely be back for the coffee and to try a donut (which looked amazing!).",

We walked in at 12:30 and the dogs didn't come til 1:05. I get that these are upscale dogs and all, but it may be hard to satisfy big crowd with that sort of lag time. Still, great little place.

The obvious: These dogs are delicious. Pairing creative, delicious ingredients with Schreiner's products is a no-brainer and the result is one phenomenal hot dog. I've never had a sub par meal at Short Leash, everything is tasty and perfectly cooked every time I receive my order.   What I think should really be mentioned is how good Short Leash is at bouncing back from getting swamped, or making a mistake on an order. When my partner and I placed our orders yesterday, they were knee-deep in orders with a line of 12 people behind us. While we waited, I popped into Urban Cookies for a cupcake, and when I came back out our food was already made and ready to go. Through some miscommunication we received pepper-jack corn dogs instead of the pepper-jack hush puppies we thought we had ordered. The dude handled it like a pro despite being super busy, and was really nice about the whole ordeal. What I thought was going to be at least a 10-minute wait was barely even five. Kudos to the Short Leash team for that, I'm always impressed by how friendly you are despite being stuffed into a tiny truck in 106 degree heat.   Amazing food, awesome service.",

They were so dry and chewy that we weren't sure if it was made the same day or not.  Flavors tasted artificial at best.  We took a single bite of each donut and threw them away.

We were looking for breakfast and she offered us a breakfast menu...we were not sure what to have for breakfast so we ordered espresso drinks while we looked over the menu as she was making our drinks....after we received our drinks, we asked if we could order breakfast-to which she said. \"The kitchen stops serving breakfast at 11:00\" Why would you offer someone a breakfast menu and NOT mention that the kitchen stops serving breakfast in 15 minutes? Based on all the reviews here, it's really more of a hotdog & beer joint which it gets great reviews for....

The fried pickles were different as they used bread and butter pickles but they were very good, somewhat spicy, as well as the devil dog dipping sauce. My sister had the hot dog on naan bread with BBQ and coleslaw - delish!! My husband and I split the maple doughnut with chopped bacon on top. Would definitely get that one again. I did try the crumbcake one and wouldn't recommend it. Tons of cinnamon and not that sweet. The kids had mac and cheese and the corn dog bites and were thrilled. Definitely coming back to this place.

The only complaint is that my husband expected more toppings (cilantro, red onion), but instead thought the little bit there was had been mixed in to the mango chutney.

Shared the Peanut Butter Dream as I am a peanut butter lover. The peanut butter cream filling was rich, but not too rich and delicious, but the cake/dough was dry and not very flavorful. I would probably stop in and try again sometime; this may have just been a less than stellar batch. The doughnuts are beautiful no doubt; hopefully next time they taste just as good as they look! Customer service was fantastic!",

You still get fly saliva at not extra charge on your donuts. The service was still the same, slooooooow. Customers were cleaning their own tables and picking up the used napkins off the floor. You have to order at the bar and pay for your food prior to getting it. They have the suggested gratuity on the receipt. I like to be served prior to giving any tip. Looks like we won't be going back here.",

I'll be honest and say I didn't really like it. It looked like a pizza. It tasted like sliced up hot dog in prego sauce with curry sprinkled on top. Plus it was lukewarm. I really wanted to like it but I didn't. I would be open to trying more items on their menu though.  I had some of my friends homemade chips and they were sooo awesome! I like it a lot. I also liked the fried pickles! Those were great too, and I highly recommend those items.  Btw, also, frosted glasses with your beer!!",

We werent exactly in business for a dozen donuts but what the hell...we went a little nuts.   The only reason why im giving it a 4 stars is because their chocolate seems cheap.

This momentous decree of great bacon, sausages, naan bread and gourmet toppings will be seared in the flames of delicious. But years later we face the tragic fact that we are still not free, not free to eat Short Leash when we want it.  But there is something that I must say to my people who stand in the long lines which leads into the palace of delicious. I have a dream that one day this nation will rise up and eat Short Leash whenever we want. I have a dream that one day we will be able to sit down together at a table inside a restaurant. I have a dream today.   It's not every day that dreams become reality, but the dream of dining at Short Leash on a whim, whenever we feel like, without waiting in lines has come to fruition.  I had the privilege of visiting during their friends and family preview, and left with great conviction to visit over and over again. They've got a few restaurant only items on their menu like Scotch Eggs, savory Funnel Cakes, and a few other gems I'll let you discover for yourself. They're serving beer and wine on their menu now, with a pitcher costing you just $7.50  Short Leash Sit...Stay will be a great addition to Roosevelt Row's way of life.  Happy Yelping Phoenix, I can't wait to see you there!",

I was so hesitant to try this place based on all the hipster reviews and and the preconcieved notion that is overpriced stuff that appeals to granolas and hipsters. Well, that may be True, but I think it appleals to everyone as well. I ordered the Noki, a dog with green chiles, pintos, cheese, and an all beef Schreiner's hot dog. They serve the dogs on flatbread which is awesome beyond belief! The taste and quality was definitely there and the portion is enormous.   Where I really want to give this place more stars is the service. I want to say they have worked in high levels of service industry before because name usage was constant. They took my name for the order and used it at least three times in conversation with me. I noticed they had a catch for bottle caps from the sodas they sell, so I asked if my girlfriend could have them for an art project she is doing. Not only did he say she could take them, but gave her a ziplock bag for them, offered to save them from future days, and tried to refuse when I recognized the great service and gave a tip.   in short (get it?) these guys get how to run a business. They are friendly, helpful, serve high quality food, and go above and beyond what the customer wants or needs. They take credit cards as well through a Droid app the guy has on his cell phone, and you sign with your finger on the phone's touch screen. I don't go to the market much, and I try not to eat hot dogs, but if I'm ever out and about when this truck is there, I'll definitely stop by again.  One hundred stars, thanks again guys!",

We  had a great time.  As a bonus the waitress/bartender who was the only one working went out of her way to interact with my 3 year old.  It was around 4 I think and we were the only ones there, the food came out exceedingly fast and fresh.  One slight negative that didn't effect our meal.  The outside patio had the strong smell of liquid gasoline because 2 of their food trucks were parked in the driveway.  I was going to sit out there but the smell was strong as soon as I opened the door, so we sat inside.  Oh yeah the chips are amazing!",

Amazing, creative, unique and delicious are only a few descriptions I can say about these dogs.   I was first introduced to Short Leash Hot Dogs through the Yelp science fair when they were handing out samples of their corn pups to everyone in line and thought they were super delicious, little did I know what other creations they had up their sleeve! I came across them again at the Devoured Culinary Classic where I got to try different samples and I also saw they encourage you to send them pictures of your dog so they can feature them with a special hot dog! Being the dog lover that I am, I sent one of the owners, Brad, an email the next day with a picture of my Siberian Husky named Sky.   At the end of May Sky was the featured dog of the week with his own special hot dog made up of grilled pears, romaine lettuce, bacon, and blue cheese dressing. I was told it was hit, so I decided to take the pup with me downtown and get a chance to meet them and try the delicious hot dog!  I have also tried other hot dogs on their menu, and you may be a little hesitant about some of the combinations of different ingredients, but trust me... they know exactly what they are doing and you will not be disappointed with any choice you make! I definitely recommend anyone and everyone to try Short Leash Hot Dogs just once, even if you are not a hot dog kind of a person!",

I love their food, and Short Leash shows in their handcrafted selections that they Love serving it even more.  They'd make a Jewish Person give up being Kosher.  A Muslim give up being Halal.  A Vegetarian take down a cow with their teeth and bare hands to help provide beef for the sausages!  I first sampled their scrumptious Jalapeno Cheese Corn Dogs and their ever so savory Spicy Beer Beef sausage at a Yelp Play Date at the Phoenix Children's Museum.  Immediately I sprung into action, liking them on Facebook  and following on Twitter so that I could stalk this cart of deliciousness wherever they went like a psychotic ex-girlfriend.  Fast Forward to last Friday Night at their weekly Sit and Stay behind Stinkweeds on Central and Camelback..  My Wife decided on the tried and True Jalapeno Cheese Corn Dogs and I tried the Moki Dog.  This decadent dog, is loaded with roasted green chilies, sauteed onions, fresh tomatoes, pinto beans, cheddar cheese and mayo, then served on a warm flatbread instead of a bun,  Also, upon my wrapped dog came a spicy pickle slice that smacked my taste buds around and made them it's bitch.  I was tempted to order a whole mess of them as a side.  Then I moved to the sausage in question.  Upon my first bite of the Moki... instant Foodgasm!  The Spicy Beer Beef was my sausage of choice and I can definitively say that any other way is just Blasphemy and you should be beaten with reeds should you deviate.  But that's just my opinion.  Since that last bite on Friday continuing through to these past few days, I've been wanting a Moki Dog so badly that I'd fistfight a Nun, a rabbi, a priest, an imam and my own grandmother if any of them got the last one!  Thankfully, Short Leash keeps a detailed schedule of where they will be and makes sure to alert their Facebook and Twitter followers to any special events and menu items.  So, getting another dog shouldn't require an ecclesiastical or familial melee.   I could go broke following Short Leash, and be happy for it.  But, Short Leash is so amazingly priced for what you get, that it won't break the bank hounding them for their Treats Of Ultimate Tastiness.

If I could give them 10 stars, I'd still bitch that it wasn't enough.  Sit.  Stay.  Good Dogs!",

Second time I went was with Julia T. and I think \"yeah I kinda get it, if you are into hot dogs...\" Third time...something just opened inside of me...something magical and warm and I felt like Belle in Beauty and the Beast, my heart opening up and for the  first time not viewing it just as a hot dog (There must be something there that wasn't there before) but as a sandwich, a meal, a real step above what I am used to in the hot dog department.  The actual hotdog...it is...How do i put it?...the texture and flavour are like BAM. Then the toppings...pick your own or go with one of the choice combinations they list...also they run specials with pet dog namesakes. You probably aren't going to get it wrong no matter what you go with.  The toppings are fresh, tasty and they are not stingy with em. It all gets loaded up into a flatbread which sounds odd but works.  Here is the real kicker...these people are effing rad. I walk up and guy says to me \"I'm sorry, I forgot your name.\" I had been there twice and not that recently I didn't even expect him to remember who I was at all.   So then I go pay with my card and realize I forgot to get a bottle of water for my dog. The guy gives me a bowl of water for him and then the lady behind the counter asks if he can have a hotdog. She even assures me they are 100 percent beef. Gives my dog a free hot dog! Mind you I think they appreciated the work he was doing gathering signatures for the DT dog park. *ching* I felt tingly all over and knew it was True love.   Cray good. CRAZY good.",

The chicken dog is super flavorful. I love it \"Lady\" style (fried pickles, onions, chipotle cream cheese)  or \"Igby\" style (bbq sauce, cole slaw, blue cheese). Service is fast and friendly and I love that they include a lollipop with each order, very cute. Find them, you wont be disappointed.",

Unfortunately, the sauerkraut covered the pretzel bread making it too messy to be considered finger food, yet the bread was nearly impossible to cut with the butter knife provided. The fried pickles were delicious. When it come right down to it, my meal (hot dog, salad and pickles with an iced tea) was a bit high (in the $20 range) and the service was terrible. (Polite, but terrible.) I'd try Short Leash again if only to use it as an excuse for more pie from the Pie Hole.",

    "text": "I am a bonafide food truck fan. From the very early days of waiting for the Kogi BBQ truck in SoCal way before the entire food truck revolution when groups would be gathered at seemingly odd spots with people curiously wondering what the heck we were waiting for. Well, it's not so weird anymore with the rise of numerous food trucks and I was happy to see that Phoenix was no exception. When I moved from SoCal, I was really bummed about leaving my food trucks. I'm dead serious.  But life is a bit brighter now that I've found several delicious food trucks here in Phoenix, including Short Leash Dogs. Of the few that I have tried so far, SLD is definitely the meal that gave me the most bang for my buck.   My fiance and I tried the Lady combination on a bratwurst. I didn't know what to expect so when we received our hot dog wrapped in flatbread as opposed to a regular hot dog bun we were pleasantly surprised. Think about it...the larger flatbread holding the hot dog can also hold more toppings and thus, more yummy flavor!  SLD has quite a few options to choose from so it will be fun going back to check out other flavors. And as others have pointed out, the service is great. The wait time is as expected for a food truck serving lots of customers - no biggie, that's just how food truck dining rolls - besides, as every foodie knows the good stuff is worth the wait.",

And I finally made it out of work to go check them out.  They are located certain times during the week downtown Phoenix where they hold the city market.  There were many food trucks lined up, but I was headed straight for Short Leash.  My eye was on the prize.    I ordered the Igby all beef hot dog and a corn doggy.  It was delish!  They even have sodas in a glass bottle for sale, and they do take credit cards.  I noticed that there were more people in line for Short Leash.  Once you go, you will understand why.  The owner was there taking orders.  I had my name badge on, and I liked how he called me by name the whole time I was ordering.  Very cool!  I agree with Lindsey F., \"Imagine every hot dog you've ever had. Ok, now throw every image out the window because you haven't tasted anything until you've had a hot dog from Short Leash Dogs. \"  That says it all!",

I have heard about their food truck for a long time and couldn't wait to try their veggie dog. I was NOT disappointed!  The atmosphere is great... casual and funky. I love the pictures of the dogs by the bathroom wall. My life's goal is to get my dog's pic up there. Even though we dined inside, the patio looks like a great place to have a couple beers and eat a dog WITH your dog.  The vast array of toppings makes it a bit challenging to order for an indecisive person such as myself. They have a few specialty dogs that take the guesswork out of it, however I'm pretty picky and found things on each dog I didn't like.  I ended up getting *drumroll*... a veg dog with tomatoes, pinto beans, cilantro, and chipotle cream cheese. Winner, winner, chicken dinner!  The naan. *Sigh* As an Indian food lover I have had LOTS of naan in my lifetime. This is the BEST naan I have ever had. Light and fluffy. The dog itself was tasty and all the toppings were fresh and abundant.  The chips that accompanied it were freshly made and tasty.  An eatery that honors people's pooches and gives vegetarians and meat lovers alike a place to get their gourmet hot dogs on? With booze? I think I'm in love.",

I got the vegetarian dog Igby style (BBQ sauce, slaw and blue cheese crumbles).  It is wrapped in the softest, warm, delicious flat bread.  Something in it was a bit to spicy for me - not sure if it was the BBQ sauce or the slaw that was spicy.  I also tried the vegetarian corn dog.  Basically hot pepper jack cheese dipped in corn meal batter and deep fried.  I didn't care for it much at all.  Either did my daughter.  (And we really like a similar thing from Hot Dog on a Stick at the mall).  I am super excited that they have veggie dogs and can't wait to try another combination.  YUM!",

    "text": "From the reviewer who brought you a stellar review for Short Leash, comes a review for their donut/coffee shop located on Vernon. Now, I completely forgot that they took over Shine, and I was just going to go randomly grab a cup of coffee after my niece was insisting that I needed coffee, she's two years old. lol.  Anyways though, parked right out front was their Short Leash Food Truck, but I wasn't really hungry just yet and was in the mood for coffee. My niece on the other hand, is always hungry, and she wasn't disappointed. I enjoyed a latte which I just told them to make me something sweet, so I wasn't 100% sure what kind it was, but it was awesome. My nieces had the maple glazed donut with candied bacon and she loved it all. They are a little pricey for their donuts, but worth it on an every now and then basis. Coffee/Lattes are priced in comparison with most of the coffee shops around here. Will stop in again, once I have a few extra bucks to spare that is. Next time, I'll have to get the \"bear\" donut.",

And there was an exorbitant amount of these toppings, so my brat (which itself was good) was drowning in sauerkraut and dressing, making it more goopy than anything. The service was also slow; we were the only ones in the restaurant and we waited a very long time for our check.  On the plus side, the decor and theme are outstanding, and each table had a deck of Uno cards, which was great for passing the time.",

The food is good and local, the service is great, I love how they've improved the little corner they're on that so desperately needed it..   BUT, recently they have been involved in parking wars that have lead to VERY unfair treatment of one of the local non-profit businesses which has been here for more than a decade and serves one of the most critically in-need populations in Phoenix. The treatment and descrimination is very, very disappointing to say the least and I cannot with a clear conscience patronize Short Leash again until the parking issues are fairly resolved.",

Went  recently coz it's slow at work plus I had a hankering for coffee, and starbucks gets lame, the coffee at the market downstairs, although fresh and cheap is not delicious, so, Rollover sounded like a good place for coffee and a sweet treat. I have to say although I'm not a big fan of brioche donuts (more of a cake donut fan), their flavors are on point. Albeit pricey for specialty donuts at $2.25/piece and the regular donuts at a little less than 2 but their baker's dozen comes out to $14, so, not bad. I like they have a good selection of coffee and carry alternative milks, like soy and almond although there is a 50 cent upcharge but no big. Will I go back? Yes, and next time I'm gonna try the maple glaze with bacon, the other specialties just sound too weird for my taste like the Bear which is bbq sauce and pb, say what?! Anywho, try out the goodness!",

We enjoyed the Aiko and Moki, both were delicious, the mango chutney was a perfect little sweet compliment to the meaty hot dog.  The flat bread is a great idea because you can really wrap this guy up and enjoy it as you walk around the market! Price was right, I mean $5 for a hot dog might seem a bit high for some but this is a BIG DOG! definitely worth it.  The only criticism I might have is that we had one person come up to us when we were going to order and ask us if they sold dog food in the truck... I guess because of the big dog painted on it with a short leash! LOL! but seriously it was a great gourmet style hot dog! We'll be back to try some other combinations! P.S- The extra touch to remember our names while we were there was nice! Good clean and friendly service.",

The Aiko had Mango Chutney, Jalapenos, Mayo, (something else but i can't remember). This was served on flatbread/pita or whatever you want to call it. It was quite different way to eat your dog, but wow I love the idea and it was super good.   Got my food in about 3 minute wait, there isn't really too many tables to sit at so prepare to be friendly with some strangers or learn how to stand and eat. I am not afraid of strangers yet soo i sat with one and ate.   Be aware if you have big sleeves food will fall in it ... mango chutney was in my jacket sleeve...soo my arm smelled REAL good after. I did get a \"complain\" that my breath smelled like mango chutney...but whatever i think they were just jealous of me getting some good food :)  oh yeah 5 dollar a specialty dog...heck yes good deal, it filled me up!",

That was cool! But bread wasn't fresh or even warmed/toasted.  Toppings were all fresh/delicious. My biggest problem was with the hot dog itself.  I like my hotdogs cooked/grilled well - grill lines and smokey and swollen on the outside and juicy on the inside. This one seemed like it was barely on the grill or maybe even boiled :( if I ever go again I'll be sure to give special instructions about cooking it for longer.  Also ordered a $3 dollar side of fries that was super disappointing. Thought I'd get something special/eclectic. Nope. It was previously frozen thin cut fries w a little black pepper sprinkled on.  And I got less than a handful. Do not get fries as a side.",

I liked it the first time, but it was all about the novelty factor. Additionally all of their items are priced quite high. for a regular dog, it was 9-10 bucks. I would be okay with it if it were a substantial portion. Unfortunately, it leaves me hungry.  Overall, a cool concept, but not worth the value. It's good if you want to try something new, and don't care about bang for your buck.",

They offer incredible combinations or build-your-own gourmet hot dogs, wrapped in warm naan. We're vegetarians and the veggies dogs are delicious and available with any toppings.

No, I'm not kidding.\"   So that's how we decided on Mother's Day brunch.   Two bratwurst Bears, a Sunny, and a Lady later, we were full, but not quitting. Sunny (prosciutto, greens, honey, goat cheese, good times) was a favorite, but I was intrigued by the promise of crackerjacks on the Bear. 'Twas so filling.   Speaking of fillings, the custard-filled coffee cake doughnut is stonery-brilliant-phenomenal and the spicy Thai doughnut is pleasant-aromatic-exotic. If you like your doughnuts how you like your men, these fit the bill... but if you like your doughnuts how you like your hot dogs, the Bear also comes in doughnut form.   Nothing was a miss, but the Sunny and coffee cake doughnut would be my top picks in future. Overall, this place successfully made naan-believing wiener-eaters out of us.",

One of us had the Crispy Dog, which is 2 cheese stuffed wieners fried in corn tortillas, with an avocado cream sauce. Wow, one of the best (and probably most caloric) hot dogs I've ever had. Nice crunch with the tortilla (not at all soggy). Gotta watch out for the cheese/oil squirting out of the hot dogs though!  The other order was for the Oliver dog - a regular hot dog with sauerkraut, Swiss cheese, and 1000 Island dressing, served up in a naan. Actually great concept, as the naan held everything together without tearing.  They have a display of soapbox derby cars - the place hosts adults' soap box derby races every year.

I love to see local businesses thrive in our city!  The location downtown is super chic, hip and a place where you want to have a beer and hot dog. Don't forget a side of that fantastic creamy mac and cheese... YUM!  I ordered the Chicago dog without sweet relish and add spicy pickles. My husband ordered the Lady and my stepdaughter ordered the kids corn dogs. Unfortunately, my Chicago dog came out with sweet relish and without spicy pickles. The server did a great job with exchanging out my dog for what I ordered, was apologetic, and was friendly about the situation. My husband hates sweet pickles, which comes on the Lady, but he didn't ask to change his order. Much to his surprise, he loves the dog exactly how it was made and was glad he didn't alter it. The kids corn dogs were good and what you would exact. Overall, great customer service and good dogs.  Here are the reasons my review was broughtdown from 5 to 4 stars include:  While the servers were very friendly and when I asked for something they provided it, it seemed one more person would have been helpful. There was only one person taking orders and one person checking on the tables. Because there were only two people in the dinning room, when someone would sit down at the table, they were asked to either order at the podium or bar. I would like to see the order being taken right away. Our order took a little longer than anticipated as well.",

We initially walked in just to take a look at what they had while we were waiting and decided, upon seeing the display, that we would be back for desserts.  We split a few donuts - bourbon cream, peanut butter chocolate, and coffee donut. They were all so delicious, reasonably priced for fancy donuts. And the place itself has a great vibe, very chill and laid back. We even played a round of Uno while we ate.  The next time, I got a maple bacon donut and it was just as tasty as the other ones I had had. I must have been hungry, because I also ordered a hotdog and a scoop of banana and dark chocolate gelato. Got a can of beer too because it was happy hour. Already looking forward to my next time back!",

I won't even lie when I do make it to Short Leash it's because I already know what I want. My favorite starters are the fried pickles, beer battered & deep fried slices of deliciousness and some of the best jalapeno poppers I have had in a long time, fresh jalapenos stuffed with smoked gouda and pimento cheese, battered and fried, Oh sweet lawd! These are some great tasting poppers!    My top 2 favorite hot dogs are The Bear and The Moki, both all beef dogs and on naan bread. The Bear has peanut butter, smoked gouda, bacon, bbq sauce and cracker jacks and the Moki has roasted green chili, sauteed onions, tomatoes, pinto beans, chedder cheese and some mayo. I'm sure if you are reading that you're thinking um no, but no really give it a try! Both of these dogs are amazing! The Bear is my favorite and The Moki to me like a fancy chili dog.  If you haven't been to Short Leash, you should stop by and give them try!",

My husband and I tried three different doughnuts- coffee cake with coffee cream filling, maple bacon, and plain vanilla with sprinkles. All of the doughnuts were very soft, but retained their full and thick shape while eating. The coffee cake one was topped with coffee cake crumbles and icing. The toppings gave it the coffee cake crunch feeling, but with a soft and doughy touch. The filling was just perfect. It tasted like a coffee with a little cream in it, so it was just what I expected! The maple bacon one was so flavorful! I loved the flavor mix of sweet and salty. It also has the texture mix of fluffy and crispy, so all of your senses are intrigued. Finally, the plain vanilla with sprinkles was far from plain! The icing was just dripping off the doughnut and would melt in your mouth to give you that *drooling while smiling* sensation.  Atmosphere is similar to any diner- metal and wood chairs with metal tables. The outside seating area is a great spot for your morning coffee and to just relax before starting your day. The staff is friendly and welcoming too! I highly recommend!!!",

    "text": "Let's be honest.  If you hate donuts, we can't be friends.  Of all the food holidays we celebrate in this great United States of America, arguably the one we celebrate more enthusiastically than any other is National Donut Day (or doughnut depending on your preference).  I mean c'mon, donuts are basically perfect.  Sweet, savory, soft, warm, decadent deliciousness.  Its our greatest excuse for having dessert at breakfast time (or anytime for that matter).  The creators of Short Leash Hot Dogs had been experimenting with donuts for awhile, but it's only been recently that they've decided to take their donut concept to a stand-alone operation.  In addition to a food truck, Rollover has opened a small full time stand right next door to Oven & Vine on Vernon Street just west of Central Avenue.  With that, I made my way here on Donut Day Friday.  The menu was pretty much as advertised on their website as they had about a dozen different types of donuts to choose from.  I wanted to try them all, but in the interest of my cholesterol I kept it at just a half dozen this time around (though I got an extra for free for donut day).  I got a couple of strawberry glazed, a couple of the coffee cake donuts, a cinnamon and sugar, an orange glaze with pistachios, and the Bear as my free donut (a peanut butter filled donut topped with gouda, crackerjacks, bacon, and a hint of BBQ sauce).  Total price for the donuts including tax came to about $12.  A little pricey, but then again these donuts are a bit more artisan than your run of the mill donuts.    The verdict?  Yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes, and yes (use your own When Harry Met Sally sound effects here).  Everyone of the donuts was warm and fresh and had a very liberal amount of glaze.  I've had the Bear before at Short Leash Hot Dogs for dessert so I knew that one was awesome.  Maybe I'm old fashioned but after trying each, my favorites were the most simple offerings I got.  The strawberry glaze and the cinnamon and sugar ones.  Just the right amount of sweetness and portion to enjoy blissfully.  The Coffee Cakes were probably my least favorite (I don't drink coffee so the coffee custard was a little different), but they were still quite delicious.  Next time I'm here I'll probably give the Maple Bacon and Chocolate Chip donuts a whirl.  A quick tip if you're coming here.  If possible, walk or ride your bike here instead of driving.  Parking is a little scarce and it seems like the businesses nearby restrict their lots to their own patrons only.  As a result, your only option is the street and the overflow from the Tapestry condos makes that challenging.  Lots of places around to park your bike though.  Overall a cool little spot.  Much like Short Leash, Rollover keeps the physical scale of their operation small, but with a menu full of tasty options to select from.  Whether its National Donut Day or a regular workday, you're bound to find a donut you'll like at Rollover.  Now excuse me while I rollover from my donut coma.",

Wouldn't call them massive in size, but substantial and weighty.  The old fashion was dense, tender, wonderful mouthfeel and texture, and the white creme into which the top was dipped was a heavenly, creamy, gooey coating. A meal in itself, and I can usually eat several standard donuts at a sitting.  It took a couple hours to feel ready to eat the triple chocolate. Dense yet. Tender, chocolate-ish cake, rich chocolate frosting, and garnished in mini chocolate chips. Another great tasting donut!  Both are calorie bombs, and both carry the richness of the cooking oil. A single donut seems to be completely filling, both from the stomach and mouth points of view, making them unlike any donuts I've ever had. Maybe these are like donuts that my mythical home-made-donut-making grandma would have made!!!  These are awesome donuts, well worth eating. However, they come at a significant cost delta over plain-old Dunkin' Donuts type donuts. The pair cost $4.84 including any taxes. That's a lot of money for what until now I'd considered to not be worth that kind of money. After considering that, perhaps it's time I contemplate that $2.42 for a morning meal isn't a bad thing, rather than thinking of these as \"just\" donuts. There is no comparison when it comes to taste and mouthfeel.",

I had the moki for the main course. It was kind of messy and tasted on the average side. It didn't really stand out... I would not order it again.

Well my husband and I returned this weekend and were not disappointed. I ordered the Devil Dog and my husband ordered the Moki, both with the bratwurst. Both are delicious and super filling. Our picky 4-yr-old had a regular beef dog with ketchup and nearly finished the entire thing, which left me with my mouth wide open. She never finishes her food!   We also had the loaded fried with grated cheese, green chile and sour cream. I probably could have gone without them. The cheese wasn't melted enough and there wasn't enough sour cream on there for them to feel or taste \"loaded.\" The green Chile is also not spicy as I'm used to having it.  Wished we would have tried the doughnuts but we were just too stuffed after our meal. Maybe next time!",

The menu is short but sweet, giving you unique combinations to top your choice of dog. The Bear can't be more praised--where else do you find cracker jacks and peanut butter AND bacon on a hot dog? If this isn't up your alley, other options include mac & cheese or seasonal fruits. There are dozens of combinations between your choice of frank, bread, and menu or build-your-own toppings.   Local beers also reign supreme here. The drafts encompass a wide range of brew types, and the fridge is always full of cans.   Finally, the donuts tempt you with a two-shelf selection at the end of the bar. Take one to go so you can have a bit of Short Leash wherever you head next.",

The prices aren't bad and last time I was there they had $2 beer specials. Any kind of beer you could want, they have. It's super casual with a laid back vibe. One of my fave casual restaurants in downtown Phoenix. Plus the patio is pet friendly! I highly recommend this place!",

Both the brat and all beef hot dog I had here where hot hot garbage. How does the quality of your food go down hill when you transition from a food truck??? The service was good which is the only thing bringing this place to three stars. Otherwise it would be one star. Get your crap together shortleash or get gone.

For $20 that seemed like a bargain, these food trucks are usually higher priced.  The food was all really good, I think I enjoyed the jalapeno and cheese corn dog the most, very tasty.  The fried pickles were nice and crispy!  Again I was taken back how inexpensive it was.  All in all I say it was worth the wait!!",

I returned last week to see that they've moved the counter that used to be right beside the front door to the wall you face when you walk in. Now, you walk up to the counter (or grab a menu and stand in line), place your order, and pay. You then sit where you want and grab your own water by the patio door. They'll bring your drink and food out to you. They may check on you once, but if you need anything you'll have to ask. Also, the dessert (donuts and other things) are located in a display case beside the front counter.  The food was great as usual! I got a bratwurst and fried pickles with the dragon sauce - so good!

Sure it's loaded with fat, carbs, and who knows what else is in a hotdog, but it sure was delicious.  That said, the hotdog itself wasnt' anything amazingly special, but the dishes they make from it is.  Next time I'm going to try that crispy hot dog and see how that tastes first.  But as for my first impression, I like it and will return.",

    "text": "Just what I was looking for: a local success story with great food at a decent price. I came in at about 12:30 on a Friday afternoon. The lunch crowd was light, and I had my choice of seats inside or out. I sat on the patio to enjoy the nice December day. I noticed they are very dog friendly. Several patrons had dogs with them, and one took advantage of the water bowl provided outside.  I ordered the pimiento cheese dip and the all-beef Igby. The pimiento cheese was delicious. It tasted like it was made on site and came with delicious fresh made flat bread. The grease on your fingers should give you an idea of the flavor and health levels of the food.  The Igby comes with cole slaw, bleu cheese and BBQ sauce, served on a pita or possibly naan bread. The cheese was funky enough to prove it didn't come out of a bottle, while not so strong as to overpower the other flavors. Honestly I would have been fine without the dog, which tasted just fine. The bites I got of just slaw, cheese and sauce were mouth-wateringly delicious.  I'm a big enough eater, but this was too much food for me. I was leaving that night and unable to bring a to-go box. I left behind a little less than half the pimiento dip and a handful of the fresh made chips that came with the dog. The chips could have used more salt and/or a dip of their own, but they were well made and good tasting.  Chad's service was friendly throughout the meal, and my total bill was under $20 for the food and a gourmet root beer. It seemed like they had a big selection of canned beer, but I was working and not able to try any. Maybe next time.  I also didn't have room for dessert, although now I'm thinking a strawberry cheesecake donut to go would have been a good idea. I guess I have something to try next time I'm in Phoenix.",

Called in my order, ready in 10 mins! Way better than postmates, which would have taken an hour. We ordered a Cubano, the Millie, a side of fried pickles and an order of poutine. The hot dogs were so amazingly delicious, and the spicy dogs delivered a perfect amount of heat. The pickles, both on the cubano and the fried variety, were a delicious blend of sweet, salty and spicy. And the poutine was like salty, cheesy heaven. Definitely cured my \"hanger!\" Would absolutely try again!",

Their building is purple on the outside, so it's hard to miss! Always easy to find parking, we walked right in. I was comfortable, the room is simple, and the sunshine barely coming in felt cozy.  The waiter was a little bit silly; he didn't attend us right away even in a near-empty restaurant, and he forgot to get me my soda pop. He was really sweet, so I didn't really let it get to me.   I only wish that they weren't so expensive. A custom dog is about $9. I still recommend this place! Everyone needs to try a short leash hot dog once in their life, and shame on them if their prices steer them away. Your stomach won't regret it, I promise.   (And make sure to try their traditional soda pop - it's all part of the experience!)",

Service:  Emily was great, friendly without being overly so. Good attentiveness, and she convinced me to try the Bear dog.   The bear dog starts out sounding right (hot dog and bacon), but then adds funky stuff:  peanut butter, peanuts, cracker jacks (!)...wrapped in naan instead of a bun?    Trust her and trust me, get past the menu print and try it. It's kind if like a Thai peanut sauce on your jalapeno dog, the bacon provides a nice burst, and the naan cuts the flavor nicely. Nothing is overbearing, the presentation is good, and although a tad expensive for a hot dog, we'll worth it. Hey, we never thought we would pay $4 for one cupcake right?  I had a normal salad and water (it was lunch), but this is one of the best casual restaurants I've visited while in Phoenix. Check it out.",

    "text": "Q. What did the Short Leash dog say when asked about the secret to a great hot dog?  A. \"Naan of your business!\"  These hot dogs are out of this world good. Each one starts with, you guessed it, naan bread, topped with a hot dog, brat or sausage with your choice of any number of creative toppings. You can also get chips or greens on the side.  I stopped by a UYE here last night and was blown away by the crowd. Luckily, we had a table and the service was prompt. I should have tried the special hot dog of the day, but in my hurry, I \"settled\" for the Bear.   If you haven't heard, the \"Bear\" is a culinary masterpiece containing peanut butter, cracker jack, gouda, bacon and BBQ sauce. The mix of sweet BBQ and peanuts must be tried. Don't just scarf this one down - savor each bite.   I'll be honest, I liked eating at the restaurant more than the food truck. There is decent seating, you remain unaffected by the elements, and the hot dogs taste better to me. When you're in the area, check out this fantastic spot right around where downtown meets midtown.",

    "text": "I know this is a popular spot.  I know the owners are down to earth, friendly and nice people.  I even like their food even though none of it qualifies for food good for your heart.  In fact, you could even claim that I love their food cause well, I just love hot dogs . . . it's one thing that's hard for me to 100% delete from my diet.  I cheat with hot dogs the way others cheat with their cigarettes.  Sometimes I'll give my husband an excuse, get in my car then drive to get an ever so yummy hot dog.  I'm just kidding, well, almost.    I also love creativity and you have to admit these guys are creative~ infusing all kinds of flavours and combinations to their doggies and tasting all so yum, yum.   Speaking of doggies.  This brings me to the reason of 3 stars.  The night we were there, all Elite Yelpers mind you so I mean, you know, we're going to be writing reviews, we're having a good time, tasting practically everything on the menu, including the fried green tomato salad (which is delectable and you get your veggies in).  Here we were, enjoy ourselves when I looked over at another table and there is a LARGE dog sitting by the table, lapping it up, doing I don't know what and well, this dog was not a seeing dog.  Just a regular, friendly, happy dog. And don't get me wrong, I like dogs . . . just not INSIDE the restaurant of where I'm eating.  I could be wrong but I think having this dog inside the restaurant violated several health code violations.  If having dogs inside restaurants is a new trend I'm NOT aware of and it complies with Photenix health code for restaurants, send me a message and I will update this review.  Otherwise, please keep the doggies on the plate, not inside the restaurant where it will cause me to question the cleanliness of the place!",

However, we waited 10 minutes to have our drink order taken, at which time we decided to flag down one of the two wait staff who had a whopping two other tables to serve.  We ordered our drinks and meal at the same time since we were 1) already done looking at the menu and 2) on our lunch break.  When the food finally came out, the appetizer we ordered came WITH The meal, the salad I ordered as the side with my hot dog looked suspiciously like potato chips, and all three dishes (two meals and an appetizer) were completely lacking any seasoning (including the chips).  There was no salt or pepper on the table, and given the service to this point, I had no confidence we would get it, so didn't even bother to ask.  I did, however, ask for some ketchup to help with the cardboard-tasting chips problem, and the waitress brought  2 TEASPOONS of ketchup in a dipping container.    The food probably ranks a 3 - original combinations, but the execution was terrible. Service is a 0, therefore, 1 star it is.  I, personally, will not be back.",

The flat bread bun is more than filling and a great way to mix things up.   As far as hot dogs go, I feel like Short Leash gives me the most bang for my buck.

On Tuesdays I often grab my lunch from here when they're parked in front of Urban Cookies, and today I was able to snag lunch from Short Leash at the Phx Public Market. It was no surprise that out of the 3 or 4 other food trucks parked in the lot, theirs was the only one with a steady line. I love that their ingredients are locally sourced, which means that when I support this local business, I'm essentially supporting all the other local purveyors of tasty foods as well! My favorite menu item is the Lady (chipotle cream cheese, fried pickles and sauteed onions), with a chicken dog and easy on the cream cheese. Another delicious option is the Igby (cole slaw, bbq sauce and blue cheese) with swiss. instead of blue cheese. Since their dogs are served on naan-type flatbread, you're saved from the awful and inevitable split along the bottom that traditional hot dog buns so tragically suffer from. Pure genius! I have yet to branch out from the chicken dog as I'm not a big consumer of pork and beef products, so I can't vouch for any of the other dog options. I did, however, try a bite of a jalapeno-cheese Corn Pup and it sure was awesome! The owners couldn't be nicer, also! Just an all-around lovely food truck that Phoenix is lucky to have.",

    "text": "What a cute little place! I've had the good fortune of eating Short Leash Hot Dogs before. Excited I finally have a place to write a review.  + Dedicated parking rocks + Incredible selection of beer + The food (come on!)  Bowing to peer pressure (Thanks Deb. V.) we shared the Fried Green Tomatoes. Battered heaven here, layered with avocado, and sprinkled with a heavenly amount of corn, bacon (BACON) and a blue cheese dressing. (The dressing was lighter than I expected. Don't say no if you're anti blue cheese. I really thought it was a creamy buttermilk or ranch. But no!)  I wanted to lick the plate. Yeah, that good.  Stuffed to the gills (with the beer I just had to have - $3 for craft beer!) I had flipped my menu to the back and selected the \"Devil Dog\". Ordered without naan (the dogs are served on a hearty size of naan) I was offered a side salad or chips. Spicy and delicious with roasted red peppers, green chiles, sriracha, sauteed onions, cheddar cheese & jalapenos. Happy times. (Even tho I couldn't eat the whole thing! Perfect when re-heated for breakfast.)  The side salad was refreshing. I'd do that again as well.  Deb. V. was trying to kill me. We shared a sweet treat served with ice cream. (I can't find it on their online menu.) Suffice it to say IT WAS GOOD. I was very tempted by the concept of a BEER Float. I'll have to return to try that.  Things I've eaten on other occasions: + The Bear dog + Corn Dog Bites + Jalapeno poppers (Eat any of those and you'll be happy.)  Emily was the bomb helping feed us. Super, super sweet!  Oh! And note: The temperature can be a tad warm inside. The ovens apparently heat this gem of a place up. Just don't show in your birthday suit :)",

Why not make more, toss a few out that don't sell and make the high margins on the ones that do sell.  Business makes more $ and customers are happier.  Inside seating also smells like a basement.  --------- Doughnuts are OK, nothing special.  They need to label the types so you don't have to ask.  They didn't have a menu so no idea what they serve or prices.  I expect a few bugs because it's new but these are basic expectations.  I'm confident they can turn it around because Short Leash Dogs is fantastic.",

They have a lot of free toppings to choose from and even dogs with clever names for interesting combinations.  Their selection of dogs is diverse and I love the spicy one. If you just want a normal hot dog with ketchup, although it will be tasty you may want to take your simple tastes elsewhere. The free toppings are basically included in the price of your hot dog.

Carrying over quite a bit of the wonderfully cheerful and efficient staff, having the same great coffee and tea, and substituting great tasting doughnuts for the great tasting pastries Shine offered works for me.  For the folks complaining about the variety of doughnuts, please take a look at the storefront. It's tiny! How many varieties do you think they can fit on their little counter? As for the people complaining there aren't any doughnuts left later in the day... that would be because their big doughnut business is in the beginning of the day for the breakfast crowd. A couple of doughnuts left over after sitting on the shelf in the display window at the end of the day and they're not fresh? Gee, why could that be?  How about this? Show up early at Rollover, get a doughnut or two (I can personally recommend the chocolate frosted, maple glazed, and maple glazed with bacon), have a big cup of hot or iced coffee or tea, and just relax.  Oh, and as a seasonal (fall) tip, try the pumpkin spice latte with a maple glazed with bacon doughnut. No need to thank me. Just enjoy this perfectly decadent combination.",

From what I see in from the writing in the window, there should have been a dozen different variety but unfortunately, we only got to pick from the 4 old donuts. The donuts were stale and heavy tasting, nothing to write home about. I really was looking forward to biting into a soft fluffy and melt in your mouth donut but these were very heavy and doughy.

We ordered our food quickly and found a seat outside to listen to the couple singing.  We ordered two hot dogs at $8.00 a piece.  Both came on pita bread which was bizarre for me but it worked and both were nice sized.  I ordered the chili dog with their spicy beer hot dog (as opposed to just a regular dog) with no raw onion (just chili and cheese) and my sister ordered \"The Lady\" (chipotle cream cheese, sauteed onion + fried pickles).  My sister loved her dog.  Mine was good but I wish I would have had the option for a regular bun.  We ordered a side of fried pickles which was a nice sized order for $8.00.  These were very tasty!  Our sodas were $2.50 each and came in a glass bottle.  My sister had a Mexican Coke and I had Leninade (Blood Orange soda).  This is place is definitely worth a try for the vast selection of dogs they have.  Check out their menu to see all of the nifty items to try,",

Being that we were starving we ate it. I can tell they use good quality products, but it was only a mediocre hot dog. Maybe if it would have been piping hot it would have been a better experience. Their chips, again lukewarm, were greasy, like maybe their oil was too cold. I feel like when there are only 5 other people in the restaurant they could have had our food hot and fresh for that wait.  The redeeming factor was the donuts. Tried the maple bacon and the spicy thai. The maple bacon was very good, but the spicy thai was excellent. Probably the best donut I have ever eaten. So for their donuts I give them a good rating. I will come back and give them another try with their dogs, but for sure will be back for those donuts.",

I haven't wanted to, nor have I caved... even at a ballpark when \"everyone else is eating one.\"  Today DD and I called Short Leash, found out where they were camped out and headed down to Urban Cookies lot to try them out.  My daughter is a hot dog connoisseur.  I mean this literally.  My parents actually started a hot dog cart business in her honor when they lived in PA.  She is very picky when it comes to her dogs.  Today we ordered the kid's dog - plain - and a veggie dog, Moki style with no mayo.  We also ordered two of the cheese corn pups.  DD said the hot dog was delicious and the best dog ever.  She said she loved the flatbread.  Okay, she called it pita... but still.  I wasn't sure what to expect when I bit into my dog, but I finished the whole thing!  Delicious.  The owner came and chatted with me for a bit and recommended the chicken dog for my next visit.  I asked if it had a pork casing and he said no... so I will try it out.  I loved the Moki preparation, though.  I love this place and I hope they offer a franchise to someone in the East Valley so I can get it more often.    Yes, it was THAT good.  Get over to Short Leash ASAP!  They have their locations listed on their website a month ahead of time.  I've printed the month of June out already!  Now if only I can get my dog to be featured...",

    "text": "Visited on a Friday night before a Suns game.  I visited with my wife and my 2 year old son.  Seemed to be quite a few families at the restaurant, yet a shortage of high chairs.  Yet, our two year old was able to reach from a normal chair, we're not that high maintenance anyways- this worked, just not ideal.  The menu is fairly large considering they serve various wieners.  What impressed me the most was the beer selection and the pricing, its AWESOME!  The beer lineup is full of crafts beers locally and beyond.  The prices run $3-$6, but most of the beers are offered for $3 or $4.  There was also a decent amount of wine offerings and some on tap (AZ wine).  The food- the food was great, no complaints.  I had the special, which was a sausage of my choice teamed up with some sirloin to pass as a Philly style dog, good stuff.  My wife had the bratwurst sliders and she had no complaints.    One thing I will note is the service could get slow, not too many servers working, especially on a weekend night.  It is also small, so you might hit a wait.  I say hit the bar, there's about 6-8 spots at the bar.  The atmosphere is modern, moderate volume music and a mixed crowd- couples, families, hipsters and hippies.  Enjoy!",

    "text": "My only complaint about Short Leash is that they don't follow me around town in the food cart, which means I cannot eat delicious hot dog concoctions all day! How unfair is that?!?  Well, Amber... we all know you are a VEGAN, so why do you want to be followed around by a hot dog cart?   Well, Reader... Short Leash has VEGGIE DOGS! That is right... this delicious, convenient, amazing food cart has VEGGIE DOGS!  The bread, however, is not vegan. But that is fine, because they chop up your wiener into little bite sized pieces and load it up with one of the many (50+??) ingredients they have available. And when you don't get it with bread, you get two!  I top my double wiener with pinto beans, sauteed onions, green chilies, jalapenos, and tomatoes. I'm going to come up with a name and have them name one special after me.  Excellent customer service, positive vibe, delicious, high-quality ingredients, and I legally get to say wiener six times in 1 review!  Wiener wiener wiener!",

They are served on a delicious flat bread/pita  \"bun\" and are filled with all sorts of toppings - not just ketchup and relish- I'm talking beans, cilantro, onions, chipotle, cheese, and peppers.   And yes, they do have a vegetarian one!! Their mock meat looked so real it was eerie - I took a nibble and I couldn't tell if they had accidently given me a real hot dog!  So, I tore off a little chunk and showed it to the hot dog man, \"This is a vegetarian one, right?!\"  He laughed and said, \"Yes.  We actually get that comment quite often.\"",

First time I was there with a large group and hey refused to serve us inside - we could only order on the patio. Problem is, the server was absent, she refused to let people pay as they go, she couldn't figure out each persons tab, and we ended up being delayed almost 30 minutes just waiting for our checks. Mind you, this was a prearranged party, so it wasn't a surprise that 50 of us showed up. Tonight they refused to serve us at all!! Issue with their card machine which is fine, but seriously we waited 15 minutes for it to get figured out and absolutely no accommodations. We had cash and they wouldn't let us purchase a drink while we waited.  All the while everyone else is getting served, two guys at the bar, the people at tables, every person before us, but not us. Get your act together.",

    "text": "Believe the hype.  Short Leash Dogs owns!  The first sign that things were about to get very good was when a saw a fork on my dog.  Right off the bat I knew it was going to be messy and that's what I like.  I scanned the menu and opted for the Moki dog.  It began with my choice of dog (regular wiener) and then topped with green chilies, pinto beans, mayo, tomatoes, and onions.  It may be the best dog I have ever had.  It was that good.  All the flavors exploded in my mouth.  Short Leash Dogs has managed to turn a simple American culinary staple into something that is utterly amazing.  My only beef with Short Leash Dogs is they tend to operate on a schedule I cannot sync with because of work.  Today I lucked out when they opened shop for the day at a Whole Foods by my place of work.  Can I really hold that against them?  No, I cannot.  Time to find a new job!",

I came especially for the wieners.  I had the Lady, hubby got the Aiko and my little cutie wanted the Corn Pup (corn dog) with relish on the side.  I prefer dogs with natural casings that lend a crunch to the bite.  Love the chipotle mayo and deep fried pickle topping.  Naan bread to hold the yummy stuff is very clever.  Hubby seemed to enjoy his order.    \"This is spicy!  Too much pepper!!!\"  as my little guy guzzled water down his mouth.  Just FYI if your kids do not like any heat on their food!    I'll get him a regular hot dog next time.  It is the best hot dog I've had in AZ so far. Now I get what the hype is about!   We will be back to tackle some of the other 50 toppings!",

    "text": "Two words: Wow and wow.  \"Wow\" because of how good it was.  And \"wow\" simply for the fact that I was wowed by a HOT DOG!  Had the beef hot dog and it was about as perfect as I can imagine such a food being. (If I recall correctly, they source their weiners from the local  Schreiner's Sausages, so certainly there's some credit due there.)  What really made this meal was that is was wrapped in a warm piece of fluffy flatbread. Best. Idea. Ever.  For toppings, I had them add pepperoncinis, bacon, and spicy mustard. Though I began to question this combo not long before sinking my teeth in, it turned out to be an excellent decision, if I do say so.  On a down note (which I didn't dock them for), the bag of chips I added to my order was stale, emanating an unpleasant dank cardboard smell. I don't know how difficult it would be, but they really should consider serving fresh chips. Even if they prepared them beforehand and kept them warm until served, it would probably put their menu over the top.  And finally, appreciated the beverages they offered, which are from smaller bottlers and provide a non-HFCS infused way to wash your food down with. I went with a GuS (Grown-up Soda) \"Extra Dry Ginger Ale\" which is not too sweet and turned out to be a good complement to my dog.",

I ordered the Mac Daddy and added the following ingredients: green chilies, bacon, mushrooms, and sauteed onions... It had to be done :).  The cool thing is that they did not gouge and charge for each extra topping.  Which is great because I like crazy combinations.  Oh, I forgot to mention I'm from Chicago.  So, no charge on the extra toppings, really was a plus.   The hot dog which is served in between naan, is fantastic!  Option fries or side salad..I went with side salad, which was great mixed greens (no Iceberg here) and a great balsamic.  To drink I order the Santa Fe  Happy Camper IPA.  It was tasty.  Good job Short Leash, I'll be back. Not to mention it is in the heart of Roosevelt Row, next door to the Nash. Around the corner from Firehouse gallery.  Good times",

We tried the Aioki dog with mango chutney, the naan bread is a great idea however the dogs were very small for the price. The mango chutney and mayo was not a good combination and the mango chutney was too chunky more like a salsa. Also had a plain hot dog and the dog was crunchy which was a bit odd to me having eaten hot dogs my whole life. The hotdogs would have tasted better just steamed and not grilled afterwards made it too dry. The staff is overall friendly. They gave a free sample of there fried pickles to try and they were okay.",
