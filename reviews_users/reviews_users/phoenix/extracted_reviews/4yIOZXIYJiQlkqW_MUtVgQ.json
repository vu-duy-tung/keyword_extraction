Do a few things really well rather than a lot of things just so-so. I can dig it. You can also get a salad instead of fries so  that's a big plus when you want to eat a bit healthier than you can at a typical burger joint. Seating is  both inside and outside but be warned that sometimes you may encounter panhandlers if you sit outside.  Also, parking can suck since this location gets rather crowded during lunchtime and right next door is a Starbucks that can also get crowded. I usually park a bit east of the area so I can get out quicker. Beats your average fast food burger joint with a baseball bat out of the ballpark.",

I heard that they have a hard time answering the phone, so I shouldn't try to pre order, just go in and place the order there, a little disappointing, I hate having to wait around when I need to get back to the office quickly. But I went and ordered there anyway. Their waiting area for your food is nice. I was able to load up on some jalapenos and peppers to take back to the office while I waited. The food didn't take long at all, about 6 minutes or so.   The grill and kitchen are open and visible to the entire restaurant, sometimes this can be scary, but here it really works. No sneaky nose picking!  A few people got the Albacore Tuna sammies and I got the #1 lunch special, a basic cheese burger and onion rings and a drink. The burger was fantastic, nice bun, great veggies and they even grill the onions! The onion rings were okay, at best, I would guess they buy them frozen.   The best part of all, other than the sammies being yuuuuummy!, was the price. It is a-la-cart, but if you just want a cheese burger (Charburger) it's only gonna run you $2.95, winning! All the burgers and sandwiches are under $4 or $5. They also have some good looking salads, and the sweet potato fries are amaze-ballz! I totally should have gotten them instead of the O-rings.   Very satisfies, I am excited to try the tuna next time. OH! And one of their shakes, they looked good too. But thanks to Jillian Michael's I am on a hard core work out regiment and cant splurge too much right now.",

It was worth coming back!   All of the food was very fresh, including the fries. (you can tell fries have been fried in dirty oil by their color....if they are very dark in color, you know the oil is old!) The fries were nice and a light golden color and perfectly salted. My husband was very surprised at his burger choice, very good he said, and he was happy they put pickles on their burgers (I wonder why in-n-out doesn't do that......?) My burger came with cucumbers and alfalfa sprouts and onions, plus I was able to get it on a whole wheat bun. It's a good \"burger\" choice for a health freak like me :)  And the whole order came to 10 bucks!! We were very pleasently surprised!! Good burgers for a good price with fast service. Can't go wrong with that!",

Cassie came by to see how we were enjoying our food since it was our first time here and when we were done eating another woman came by and took our tray away.

They also read your order back to you both when you order it and when you pick it up at the counter. I don't think this is trying to be the best burger place in town, but rather a convenient one without a drive-thru. Plus their bbq sauce, which is kept behind the counter, is excellent.   Sometimes I just want to get a burger without the fries and drink and cater it my way. Here I pay three and change and I'm out the door. Plus their milk shakes are excellent, food is made to order and not under a lamp and if you stay and eat there, seating is in abundance, there are misters outside and the drink selection is plentiful.",

I was thinking this was going to be cross between fast food and gourmet burgers, but I was kinda hoping it was going to err a bit more to the side of gourmet than fast food.  It IS fast food, albeit slightly more healthy because of some options that one might find only at a more gourmet place. But ultimately, it falls short for me. It has more options than In and Out, but fewer options than Carl's Jr. They do not offer a Turkey patty, which I would have greatly appreciated. They do have a chicken sandwich and some salads, but I came for a burger, not a sandwich or salad. They have a veggie burger which comes on a wheat bun with cucumbers and sprouts and some sort of honey mustard stuff and avocado is an option. But the patty is just Morningstar Farms/Garden burger thing that although being cooked well just didnt give me any sort of wow factor.  I ordered regular fries, though I could have ordered sweet potato fries or onion rings, which were cooked nicely but were completely unsalted. They spent a little time on presentation with a lettuce leaf and an orange slice which looked pretty but seemed pointless.  Im not saying it was bad by any means, just not what I was looking for, and frankly Id rather go to Carl's Jr. if Im in the mood for this kind of burger. They're faster, they have more options that include turkey burgers, and they're a bit more upfront about just how gourmet they really are.",

It wasn't bad, but kind of average for a burger. If you are going to sell yourself as a \"burger grill\", you need to have a product that \"wows\" your customers. I can't say that about this burger. The meat was slightly undercooked and the flavor was just okay.  The french fries were actually really good - they reminded me a little bit of McDonald's fries, but thicker in size. Seasoned about the same.  I would go here again if I were with a group of people that already had their mind made up, so don't think I'm completely ripping these guys. I just don't understand the other reviews giving these guys high marks - seems a bit overrated.  If you really want something good, though, I would steer you to Five Guys, Zipp's or Uncle Bears before I would send you here.",

I honestly just couldn't get enough.   My favorite part of this place is the ability I have to customize just about anything on the menu. On my last visit, 2/16/15, I ordered a veggie patty with swiss cheese and a side of fries. I'm not even a vegetarian, but DANG! That was one tasty veggie burger!! In addition to what is prepared behind the counter, many of the condiments and \"side offerings\" on the flip side are equally as wonderful in flavor and variety.   To top it all off, the customer service here was great! The man who took my order was all smiles, very welcoming, and friendly.

Upon completion of order and payment, they give you a disc that lights up when your order is ready. We grabbed a table, filled our drinks, and got condiments while waiting for our number to be called. Once our food was ready and we all divided up our orders, we got down to business and enjoyed our meal, re-filling drinks and getting more condiments as we went along.  This was my 2nd time here (first time, I brought my dad here for lunch while he was visiting me from out of state), and just like the first, I really enjoyed it. I learned on this visit, however, that they have added Sweet Potato Fries to their repertoire, so next time, I will definitely gt those with my meal. My friend got them with hers and they looked so tasty!  My burger was cooked to absolute perfection and they put very little lettuce on it, which I prefer, being I have braces and get lettuce caught in my brackets very easily. The fries were perfect...not really salty, which is one big complaint I have about a lot of places. I am so NOT a salt person and can't stand overly-salty foods.   I recommend The Habit to anyone looking for a new burger place to try. One bit of confusion I must clarify: the drive-up outside is for the Starbucks next door, and people have thought that The Habit has a drive-through. Not the case, unfortunately, but they do offer take-out as well as dine-in.",

It was our first time there and one of the workers went above and beyond for us. She was very nice and helped us in our selections. The food was cheap and my boyfriend really enjoyed the turkey burger. They're really nice to kids and even gave them extra candy along with free drinks. Service as prompt and the place was clean. They should expand their place though.",

    "text": "I love Habit Burger. The staff has always been super friendly. I've always found the dining room as well as the restrooms to be clean. The negative would be the parking. Depending on the time of day and how many are hanging out at Starbucks, the parking lot can be full. There is plenty of parking however towards the Fry's store so it's easy to find a spot over there. On this visit, C ordered the kids hamburger with cheese (55 cents extra), Apple sauce and chocolate milk. $4.50. I ordered the #1. Charburger with cheese, no Mayo. Comes with fries and a medium drink. $7.05. Whoa. How much change am I getting back from my $20? I mean at Fatburger, 5 Guys, Smashburger, Burger 21 etc... I get back some coins and maybe a buck or two when C and I go out for dinner. Nice. C said his kids burger was great. Patty fit the bun and it wasn't cooked like a hockey puck which a lot of places do when it's a kids burger. My burger was also nicely cooked and very tasty. I love the fries here almost as much as the fries from In n Out. My burger dollar goes farther here, the food is very good and you don't get a smackdown buying a kids meal. Oh, and the manager Will, he's awesome. Great Burgers, Great Food, Great prices. 4 Stars.",

Pros: -Quick and friendly service! -They don't charge for ranch -They haven't messed up our order (we have picky eaters - no onions, no pickles, etc.) -Quality and price are great -Onion rings are absolutely delicious every time  Cons: -Not very many locations  Overall: I prefer to come here than In and Out or Red Robin, but my husband doesn't agree with me.

Needless to say I did not eat it nor the burnt onion rings. Dealing with the burger was such a big ordeal that I didn't even mention the onion rings. This location is COMPLETELY different from my experience at the Phoenix location on 16th Street and was a True let down.",

I like you can add jalapeno for free. It is a tad pricey but way better than say a Burger King. But other times it is super slow and your food looks burned but is luke warm. So it is hard for me to recommend this place because I don't know what version they will get. I once asked for new frys because they were cold. They looked at me like I had 3 heads. A few people have come in saying they made a phone or web order. I heard one complain it was taking forever and what is the reason to preorder. So I don't know take a shot if you want to. One little things no that stuck with me was I used the men's bathroom. It was fine. Clean. Except the sink. One of those auto faucets. After I got it to turn on out came a trickle of water. I gave up. I pray to God the employees have a working sink!",

If that's all I'd ordered, I'd probably give this place 5 stars. Unfortunately I also ordered a regular Charburger with cheese and sweet potato fries. I hate that plastic imitation American cheese so I asked for Swiss. Of course it still came with American. Strike one. The sweet potato fries might have been good but were as cold as if they were 3 hours old. Strike two. The awesome Santa Barbara is the only reason this place even gets 2 stars.

The parking lot is still a scary mess, the eat-in space is way too small, and the outside misted eating area is only OK in the winter (way too hot for summer). The tables were all dirty, the floor needed cleaning, the trash bins were overflowing. Interestingly, there were two cups on the counter for tips (really, tips at a fast food restaurant???).  I had the tri tip steak sandwich on a toasted french roll with grilled onions ( $7.39 with tax). Some of the pieces of steak were tender, some were tough and chewy with a bland taste. The toasted French roll held up well (the other choices were a whole grain bun or toasted sour dough bread). Tomato on the sandwich was under-ripe and it had way too much mayo. There was a thin slice of orange as a garnish. This is still a less than average fast food option.",

You'll wish you didn't know about it. You're better off not knowing about it.\"  So, we went.    What is better than a fresh char grilled burger? Not much. The place serves single, doubles, you name it. They also offer chicken sandwiches, but it's a burger joint so I opt for the burgers.  I always get the single with cheese and this is enough to fill you up, but not to where you feel gross after. That's what the fries, onion rings, and shakes are for. ;)  The burgers are perfectly cooked and not dry but not greasy.  The buns are toasted and slightly crispy around the edges.  Perfection. You can opt for a variety of standard toppings and they also serve speciality burgers with mushrooms (gross) and other options. I stick with the basic cheeseburger.  The fries and onion rings are crispy and delicious.   The place gets packed at lunchtime, but the line moves quickly and you can have a seat while you wait for your number to be called.    I kinda wish I didn't know about it.  This is my go-to for my friends' kids and they offer child portions, nuggets, etc.",

From fancy local business restaurants to cheaper chain-restaurants (that scarcely carry sweet potato fries), this is the only place that has consistently perfected the crisp recipe of the fry. My absolute favorite whenever I'm craving sweet potato fries.   Even places that do carry sweet potato fries, they contain salt, and/or too much grease! Also a lot of places manage to BURN the sweet potato fries):!   However, I am a lover of these fries. So crisp and fresh and cooked just perfectly EVERY TIME. Their grilled chicken salads are amazing and cut FRESH too.",

The double char with cheese is right around five dollars, while the same thing at Five Guys will run you close to $8. The burger here IS smaller, but still plenty.   This specific location is fantastic, the employees are great, and I love the Strawberry lemonade thing they make in house every day. Only negative is that the fries are pedestrian. They were fine, but the second time I just got a burger and skipped the fries. I've heard great things about the sweet potato fries. Not really my thing.   If you've never had this burger, drop what you're doing and go there now!",

They could not work in an order for nine hamburgers to pick up at 11:45?   Could they have not just told me that the first place?  By the time they answered my question I stopped by the store and it was not even extremely busy.  There is a lot of competition in the hamburger market and this customer service was extremely poor.",

I just wrote the above review and had to edit my review just to come back and say... yuck.  I have a bad taste in my mouth from thinking about this place and am still bitter of the False advertising of quality food.  I wouldnt eat here if someone paid me.

Two workers came over to clean it up but not only did they clean it up, one (Will G) actually went next door to Starbucks to get me another drink and paid for it!

I like when places repeat your order to you so that it prevents most of those mistakes. It came out with the telltale signs of microwaved meat. Rubbery consistency and that gross gray color.

The Habit serves up great burgers, fries, shakes and even salads, but the star attraction at the Habit are the onion rings, they are to die for.  The Habit also offers sweet potato fries if regular potato fries aren't your thing.  However, do yourself a big favor and order the crunchy onion rings, with ranch dressing on the side, you won't be disappointed .  The burgers  at the Habit come dressed in different flavors, but always freshly made and worth the wait.  The Habitb has a condiment bar with peppers and pickles, and there is no extra charge for whatever you want on your burger (grilled onions, mushrooms, lettuce, tomato, etc.)   The Habit is very reasonably priced. The restaurants are very clean and the staff has always been extremely accomadating.   I would go here any day of the week over other fast food restaurants.",

    "text": "I wanted to give Habit Burger Grill 4 stars on the strength of the burger, and when my wife saw that she gasped in disbelief, and insisted Habit is only 3 stars.   She wins.  She did not like the grilled chicken salad she ordered. Way too much flavorless iceberg lettuce, she said, and the grilled chicken while ok, was nothing special. The dressing was typical processed salad dressing.  But I came for the burgers.  Overall my double charburger was good. I liked the onions, and the shredded lettuce and other toppings. The burgers are cooked on a grill, and I thought the patties were a little dry, and not as tender as I would've liked. I really prefer patties cooked on a flat top, they tend to be juicier cooked that way. And there wasn't much char on my burgers, or at least I couldn't taste any.  The fries were a letdown. They're ok, but just ok.   Habit burger was tops in a Consumers Reports reader's survey of Burger chains. But I disagree. It's a step up for sure from Wendy's or McDonalds, but there are better burgers chains out there for sure.",

    "text": "The Habit Burger Grill 1817 E Guadalupe Rd Ste 102 Tempe, AZ 85283  Companion and I were in the mood for burgers for lunch and decided to try a new place. We were promptly greeted from behind the counter with a nice big smile and a cheery hello.  We both ordered the #2 Double Char ($8.15) which includes fries and a drink. Companion added cheese and bacon to his sandwich. I asked for well done fries.  They have a drink bar where you can select whatever you like to drink. This was the first place I have ever seen that has pomegranate lemonade, which was a real treat.  We found seats and loaded up on napkins as well as ketchup for the fries and some salt. Unlike many burger places they do not season their fries, which I prefer to the usual salt shower used in some places.  In due time our burgers were brought out. Big, juicy burgers that oozed when you picked it up. The fries were excellent, and crunched when I bit into them. It was nice to get my food made my way instead of being what they thought I would want.  Companion's burger was loaded with bacon and had cheese dripping off of it. Neither of us minded getting our hands a bit soiled eating such a big, excellent burger.  The place was spotlessly clean and a member of the crew even came by to make sure our lunch met our satisfaction.  The menu had quite a number of selections on it all of which were at an excellent price point. I'm already planning my next trip there to have the Tri-Tip Steak or the Portabella Char.  Dings - only one - they only cook their burgers medium or well done, and I prefer mine rare or medium rare.  4 stars",

Where else will you find a fully garnished hamburger for only $3? Also they have a great selection of other things like chicken and even a couple of salads that are pretty solid. Really what tops it off though is the fries, sweet fries and onion rings. You just can't go wrong getting any of them here and that's really necessary to make a good burger joint. Also, I have to add, their Coke machine makes some good stuff too. I really kind of dislike the ice at some places, but here they have real solid cubes of ice that produce a very classic soda.  Specifically at this location, they have an above-average layout with outdoor seating and even the staff is always extra friendly here. If you like a burger and fries this is a great place to get it at a reasonable price. It really beats McDonalds, Burger King and Wendys everyday for a similar price point.",

    "text": "The BF and I tried Habit for lunch today and really liked it. I had a burger with cheese and he had a double burger with cheese meal. I also had a side caesar salad. I really liked that this place puts grilled onions on the burger and the fact that they have a lot of different sides to choose from. My salad was better than expected for a fast food place. I tried a fry and thought it was good, nice and crispy. The burgers were a good size, not so big that I felt sick after eating it, but  filling. I think if I wanted to get a fast food burger again, I would come here over In and Out (I'm not a fan of in and out.... always leaves an oily feel in my mouth). The people who work there were also very friendly, their credit card reader wasn't working, but the lady at the register was still really nice despite looking a bit stressed. Another girl who works there offered to take our tray on her way back to work from her lunch break. Anyway, it was a good place, I want to go back to try their other sandwiches.",

Indoor and outdoor seating perfect for this time of year and the music was nice; comfortable. The restaurant, condiments and restrooms were clean and well kept.   The burgers were good, its apparent the ingredients are fresh. The fries and the onion rings are frozen, yet are good and were crispy! I will be returning to try more on the menu!

It's a bit like In 'n Out Burger in price, with a char grilled flavour rather than the standard flat-top taste.    Cons: The prices are really good, but for an additional $1 for mushrooms I expected more than one sliced mushroom.  The burger patty was a little over salted.   Pros: Again--the prices.  Also, the fact that they have onion rings AND that they came out well done--nom nom.  The food may be slower than fast food, but it came up quite a bit more quickly than a standard sit-down restaurant.  The restaurant was fairly clean, and the staff were friendly and efficient.  Best of all--they have a lettuce-wrapped option.  We'll be going back in the weeks to come, and bringing the kids.",

Found the fries to be marginal at best.  Assume that they just purchase the pre-done frozen numbers.  They had little to no taste.  I didn't try the shakes, but those suckers were flying out of there while I had diner.  Figure I'll try the onion rings next time.",

The fries are very good they got a nice thick mouthy feel and texture to them.. the burger was also pretty good though the ground beef overall was relatively bland, but the assembled burger was quite tasty. I would give this place four stars except they have a partnership going with DARE (YES REALLY!!!) and there's two stoned morons out front taking donations for DARE! is there anything more pathetic than a 30 year old government program that was proven ineffective being purchased by the private sector!. Maybe I would take it more seriously if it looked like those two idiots could actually pass a drug test. and maybe it's a bad joke like the burger is addicting but really come on now! When they get rid of those two DARE morons and their toy drive, my review will go up to four stars. And by the way, for completeness, I should mention that the Yelp app sucks. It nags and nags for a review, despite the fact that nagging for reviews violates their own TOS.",

Also had a Ceasar Side Salad ($3.95) which well... was just that... nothing special, but fresh, and served the purpose. Co-diners were very happy with their salads/burgers as well.  Fries are very good, if not a bit on the average side. Staff is hellbent on making sure you're happy, and the experience is much calmer and enjoyable than Five Guys (similar concept).

The service was friendly and fast, but the loud music being pumped into the dining room (Rob Thomas and Jack Johnson, you've got to be kidding me) made me want to change my dine-in order to a carry out order. The burger was made with two thin, dry patties and the onion rings were nearly identical to Carl's Jr.  The Habit is basically a fast food restaurant masquerading as a hip, new burger joint.",

Ordered the superfood salad which was a generous portion but I didn't love the salad dressing it came with so I ordered a side of balsamic vinaigrette. The double char cheeseburger was good but I wasn't a huge fan of the fries. They didn't have much seasoning and were just kind of thick and bland.   To me, this place has an upgraded fast food vibe to it. Which is fine if you go in expecting it. You can see the cooks throw the frozen burger patties onto the grill in front of you so you kind of know what you're getting. I did really enjoy their special house lemonade because it had fresh fruit and cucumber floating in it that provided a nice flavor. It did need to be poured over ice because I originally tasted it straight from the serving jug and it was lukewarm.   Overall, descent food but not anywhere I am dying to run back to.",

Depending on my mood and type of burger I'm itching for, this is most likely the spot I'll hit. Wooo!",

    "text": "I recently signed up to be a part of The Habit Burger Grill's mailing list to receive coupons and promotions.  My first coupon after signing up was for a Charbroiled Burger W/ Cheese.  I stopped in for lunch to redeem my coupon.  When I walked into the restaurant around 1:30ish I noticed there was a lot of little pieces of paper on the floor, crumbs, and unclean tables.  It wasn't filthy but it wasn't the cleanest for sure.  When it was my turn to order, I stepped up to the register and notice how FILTHY the kitchen/grill area was.  It was a mess!  Fries all over the floor, old napkins, I noticed the top of a hamburger bun on the floor.  A worker was sweeping up around the grill while I ordered.  I thought that was gross.  There wasn't a line or anything and only 3 other people dining inside of the restaurant.  I don't understand why they wouldn't just wait until no one's around to clean up around the grill.  It was gross.   My burger came shortly after I ordered it.  I ordered it as is but added mustard.  I decided to eat in my car because of the obvious reasons.  When I took the burger out of the wrapping it was full of grease.  That's weird to me because I don't expect a Charbroiled burger to be full of grease. I took 3 bites and tossed the rest in the trash.  The worse thing is when I got back to my desk my fingers smelled horrible.  Like I ate or touched something bad.  They smelled like old grease and burnt plastic.  It was weird.  I won't return to this location because I'm nervous of the conditions.",

    "text": "Q:  How did the jury find the hamburger? A:  Grill-ty as charred!  This beloved California chain that has made its way to Utah, Nevada, and Arizona is amazing.  Mr. Dubs and I came here today when SRP screwed up one thing or another and the whole neighborhood's electricity went out.  Do you know how hard it is to pop in your contacts and do eyeliner in the dark?  It's hard.  But the struggle was well worth it when a delicious charbroiled burger and lovely A/C was there to greet you.  After the lovely server went through the menu with us and gave us some suggestions, we ordered the Teriyaki Char, the #2 Original Double Char meal, and a side of tempura green beans.  Such delicious charry bits of goodness!  Everything was well-seasoned, had good flavor, and tasted great.  I especially loved the tempura green beans with a side of ranch.  It was well worth the extra calories.  Get lettuce, tomatoes, mushrooms, and grilled onions on your burger for no extra charge but cheese is like $0.55 extra and stuff like bacon and avocados are also an extra dime or two.  Don't forget to stop by the swanky chili peppers/pepperchinis/pickles bar and grab yourself a strawberry puree limeade with cucumber slices.  It was a bit sweet for my liking but it was super refreshing on this hot summer day!  All in all, I'll definitely be back here again! Indoor seating is limited as well as parking and since there was a constant flow of customers, the place could end up a bit messy but oh well.  Good food at decent prices!  $20 lunch for two ain't too shabby for a fast food joint with much better quality.",

One reviewer stated their burger was undercooked and mine was overcooked.  I would have traded for the undercooked any day.  That's when you get the moistest tastiest meat.  The burger could have used a little more seasoning but it was still good overall.  The onion rings and french fries were so crispy and delicious!  These alone would have me coming back when I am feeling a cheat day.   I think this place is a decent value overall.  Habit's combos are fairly priced but I avoid soda like the plague so the a la cart options are for me. For $6.43, I got a double burger and a massive order of onion rings.  At five guys we are almost at $10 for the same meal and I don't think they are that much better.  However, that's for you to decide.",

It's basically a more expensive In and Out Burger with worse fries. The burger was better I think because they have avocado as a topping. Their fries were like Burger King's, which I hate. If you like them, maybe you'll like the Habit more than me.   Pricing was I think $5.95 for a burger meal, but it didn't include cheese or bacon so you have to pay for each topping you want. I want to try their chicken club melt but I saw a $6.75 price tag (no fries or drink). For those prices I'd rather go to a sit down grill like Mac's.  Overall I'll go there if someone else wants to, but not a on consistent basis or anything.",

We had the fries, onion rings and shakes, would give them all 5 out of 5. Staff very friendly. Saw the other grilled sandwiches they offered looked very good, so will give those a try next time.",

I have come here a few times when visiting Phoenix, and while I have enjoyed the mushroom Swiss charburger and love their onion rings (their fries are okay), I have yet to feel drawn enough to make this place a regular destination. I do have one general question about the new gourmet burger fad: if you make a burger so large and stuff it with so many different things that you cannot fit it into your mouth, is it still a burger (given that a burger is supposedly a type of sandwich)? Still, their charburgers are good and served at a good price, and I do aim to come here one day to check out their veggie burger, as I like to encourage restaurants to offer some type of veggie burger option.",

Like In-N-Out, they have carmelized onions for their burgers which I prefer over raw onions. I also like that you can have have half onion rings and half fries with your combo for those who, like me, want variety. They also have very good ranch. It's kind of thin and runny but perfect for dipping fries or onion rings in :) Also there is a condiment bar with 3 different kinds of peppers. Sometimes I like to add jalapenos or some of those flourescent yellow peppers (sorry don't know what these are called) to my burger for a little kick.  Service is extremely friendly here and prices are very reasonable.",

I really do like the electronic devices that accompany your order, which literally \"give you a shake\" when your freshly made food is ready for consumption.  I order the Char burger without cheese, with extra lettuce, tomato, pickles, grilled onions, and raw onions, as well as fries, and thoroughly enjoyed them! The burger was quite flavorful and juicy, and the majority of the fries were fried to a crispy perfection. However, the wrapping of the burger could have been done better, since as soon as I bit into my burger, a bunch of lettuce and onion bits fell from my burger, which was severely disappointing. Moreover, some of my fries weren't quite that crispy and were actually somewhat soft. The biggest disappointment was the inconsistency with the jalapenos - some of them were crunchy and fresh, but the bulk of them were just soggy and sad... But all in all, The Habit does know how to serve good burgers and fries!",

I've gotten so many people hooked on this California original since.   Please try the onion rings here.

After work yesterday, my craving kicked in again. Fast text to the hubby and I flew off to The Habit. It's where I need to go when I want delicious food.  I certainly over did it this time and I'm really okay with it. I ordered the double meat burger, onion rings, and topped if off with a chocolate shake. (No whipped cream of course, because that's loaded with calories.)  My food was out in no time and the burger was juicy and delicious with perfectly melted cheese and grilled onions that were delectable. The onion rings were hot, I mean piping hot! Once they cooled down a bit, the breading was crunchy and flaky all at the same time. PERFECT!   Of course my favorite part of the experience is the shake. I must report that it is my all-time favorite shake. No other food establishment comes close to making a shake that is cold, creamy and pure deliciousness.  The ladies room is clean and well maintained as is the entire dining room. There were families, couples and even singles like myself enjoying their food. Outdoor seating is available as well. If there is no parking around the store, there is plenty in plazas large parking lot.  Where your burger craving kicks in, GO TO THE HABIT and enjoy an outstanding burger (onion rings, and shake)!",

I hate onions though and am basically mentally allergic to them, if that makes sense. I ordered my burger without onions but it was made rather sloppily and had 4 large chopped onions on it that I had to remove.   Overall, still a tasty burger but I wish the person finishing the burgers worked a bit more carefully so I wouldn't have to remove something from my burger that I requested to be left off.  I'll still be back again.",

Needed something quick and close tonight and decided to check out Habit.  Walked in, ordered, and then looked at the grill after I paid to see them putting frozen patties on it. Against my best instincts, I decided to not immediately cancel my order.  Flavor is nearly identical to Burger King, yet prices are substantially more. Burger meat was mealy, lettuce was old and papery with a bun that was well on it's way to stale. The only thing that tasted good was the melted American cheese.  Wendy's dropkicks this place and don't even think about comparing it to In and Out or Shake Shack.   Complete waste of money... Didn't even finish the burger.  Anyone that posted a 4 or 5 star review for this place must rate Purina dog food as good meal.  The place was a mess too, and the prep station looked like it hadn't been wiped down in hours.  2 stars only because the staff were extremely congenial.  Thoroughly disappointed.",

Other burger places definitely have competition if The Habit keeps the consistency on their food. Personally, I'd have to say that this is one of my top burger choices specifically because the flavors come together very well. I gave it 4 stars instead of 5 because although they have great burgers, their fries lack any pazazzzzz. They are nothing special and they taste just like all the other fries. If The Habit can create some sort of specialty fries unique to their restaurants, they could end up being more popular than In N Out or any other comparable burger places. This place also has a bunch of great staff members. They are always kind, efficient, and quick in getting the meals to their customers.",

The full-flavored malt reminded me of the passion expressed in Robert Johnson's Malted Milk song. $25 for two is a tad pricy for a lunch rotation place for me, hence the four stars.

    "text": "What is it with Arizona and their obsession with California chains?  It's like every mediocre thing they have in CA, it must be imported here to please the transplants and the AZ residents that have CA envy.  Unfortunately for The Habit Burger Grill, this is more like the mediocre CPK than it is the fantastic In n Out.    The burger's are 1/4lb so to get 1 patty for $4 (without fries and a drink) is outrageous, especially when I can get a double double meal for around $5-6.  I went with the double with fries and a drink and it was over $8.  Burger was average, fries mediocre.  For people that eat in they even use the same burger diapers In n Out uses.    I don't know what was up with the place, they literally had 10-15 employees working when I was there.  There were 6 of us dining in.  Maybe that's why it is so pricey, they have too many people to pay.  This place may appease the LA transplants that feel everything is better from back home but I don't see too many people deciding to spend $3 more for inferior food than a drive thru like In n Out.    The only thing \"habit\" about this place is that I'm going to make a habit of not going back.  I also didn't understand why they felt the need to give out the vibrating thing as I waited for my order.  I wasn't waiting for a table, I was waiting for a bag of food.    Hit up Lobby's a mile or so north for a big, juicy, flavorful burger  that is locally owned and blows away this less than stellar chain from CA.  The most disappointing thing is the landlord kicked out TOTTs for a run of the mill burger chain.",

A woman was out and about the entire time I was there picking up trays and sweeping.  I'm not too picky about my surroundings but I appreciate places that keep up on cleanliness.    My final verdict is 3 stars.  The Habit is not a place I would go out of my way to eat at.  If I was in the area or a guest requested a stop, I would have no issues stopping.

That's NOT a knock on In-n-Out, they simply don't have anything outside of burgers, fries, and shakes. Does somebody in your party like bacon, a different kind of sandwich, salad, or onion rings? Can't go to In-n-Out...  The quality of the food was good. Everything was hot, fresh, and tasty. We had charburgers, sweet potato fries, regular fries. No issues with anything. Not a bad deal as far as I'm concerned.  You can tell they're a little heavy on the corporate style right now in order to keep things going in the right direction with the new location, but it wasn't offensive to me, despite what appeared to be a high number of people appearing to be 'supervising'.

I thought the portion size (burger at least) was good, and everything tasted fresh which is a plus.   For what it market seems to be, I think it is 4 star quality. It isn't anything that blows me away, but if I find a joint in this type of market that did I would be amazed. I'd say it is about on par with In N Out for me, just different finishing (In N Out has their sauce compared to just the mayo that was on my Double Charburger).   If you like In N Out, I'd suggest giving Habit a try, I don't think you'll be too disappointed. If you tend to go mostly to BK/McD then you need to go to Habit right away, it will blow those two out of the water (and I love BK now and then).",

It took me a while to navigate the line, but I ordered my burger and fries, and they give you this pager thing like you get at restaurants, which lets you know your food is ready. It's  good system, because it gives you a chance to grab your drink and pick a table. The first couple times I went I had a bacon cheeseburger. I really liked the flavors, the bun is delicious, and the fries are really good. Very crispy which I like.  As you're ordering, you can see them grilling the meat on an open flame, and you can also watch them put together the orders. They clearly strive for quality, and it shows. Their charburgers are really good.   I look at this like a better In-and-Out with more options. The grilled buns and American cheese remind me of In-and-Out, but you can also get bacon, mushrooms, a couple kinds of cheese etc. They also have healthier options, including salads and grilled chicken sandwiches (the grilled chicken is great).  I'm glad I found The Habit, because it's become a regular lunch spot for me.",

The prices were very reasonable and the customer service in person went more smoothly than over the phone.  I would recommend this to anyone who enjoys a good burger at a great price.",

There were two senior ladies who needed a little extra help and the staff went out of their way to accommodate them. We also had two managers ask us about our lunch as we ate. When the senior ladies were leaving the manager not only walked them out, held the door asked about their meal but then proceeded to walk them to their car and hold open the door. I will definitely return to this establishment for the customer service and bonus - the food was good!",

    "text": "My only disappointment with The Habit is that it's so far away from me. Seriously.   I was in Tempe to get my hair cut, and had some time to kill, so I went into The Habit to check out their menu. I ended up ordering the mushroom/swiss burger, and was pleasantly surprised!   The mushrooms were fresh and sauteed when I ordered. The burger was pretty damned good for \"fast food\" (it's not the drive-thru variety--these are grilled to order, but it's not a gourmet burger establishment). The cheese was perfectly melted, and although the beef was a little over-done, it tasted amazing!   When one compares the quality of burgers from places like The Habit and Culvers, it makes you wonder how McDonald's, Burger King and Wendy's stay in business.   They're adding locations in Paradise Valley and north Scottsdale, thankfully. For now, I\"ll drive down to Tempe to cure the burger itch!",

Let me tell you, those guys were working hard. I went with the classic single charburger with cheese and sweet potato fries. They gave me a pager and my drink cup for the short wait. It didn't take very long.   The burger here was very good. It was hot and fresh and I thought the flavors came out. You could taste the beef, and I really like the caramelized onions they put on it, rather than red onions, which aren't my favorite. The sandwich stayed together well, which is always a plus.   I was not as impressed with the sweet potato fries. They had a nice flavor, but they weren't crispy and I prefer crispy fries. Next time I'm going with the onion rings instead.   For a quick place to grab a simple burger this place is a good option.",

Thank you Habit for bringing me a little piece of home to AZ. The burgers are so good, the Malts and the albacore sandwiches man. Mouths watering now. People in California don't really go to In N Out  that much. Az is way behind the times in this regard. Do yourself a favor and eat The Habit!  Food: the ones in Santa Barbara are better. The burger didn't have the same char flavor and has a little on the salty side. Establishment: nice looking, on par with all the other trendy burger places. Definitely like the old school walk up ones back home better. Overall: B+",

They had to put it right across the street from the Changing Hands Bookstore, Hoodlums Records, and Trader Joe's didn't they?  Bastards.  I see many Habit visits in my future . . . now if they only served beer . . .  At only $3.25, their Teriyaki Charburger is awesome.  Toasted bun, grilled fresh beef, grilled pineapple, grilled onions, teriyaki sauce, mayo, lettuce, nice big pickle slices, and 86 the tomato.  Grab a little cup of jalapenos, pepperoncini, and banana peppers at their peppers and sauce bar to go with it  The place was packed.  Literally a line nearly out the door, but this was at about 1pm on a Friday.  As I sat outside, I saw a bunch of people park, start walking up, then get back in their cars.  They should have stayed.  The line moved quick, and the wait for food wasn't that bad.  They give you a beeper thingy, so you know right away this isn't \"fast food\", but I love the idea of it.  Find a table and chillax.  No standing around waiting for your food, no mystery about when it's ready  I really like the side patio.  Fully covered, with ceiling fans and misters.  Will be a nice place to chill with a book you just got at the Changing Hands across the street",

    "text": "It's nice to see a chain that is committed to doing something and doing it well. We have a local Habit restaurant here in California. On a whim, we decided to drop into one near our hotel in Phoenix last week. Both my wife and I ordered the same thing we always do--mostly to see if the experience was consistent. Well it was. Consistently yummy, might I add.... If you find yourself in Chandler with a hankering for a great burger, I highly recommend the Habit.  4 out of 5 stars for the food being a little on the pricey side for the amount that you get. But who am I to quibble, we'll still be back.",

It's good but nothing that stuck in my memory so much that I'd be rushing back.  I'd stop in but not make it an effort.    The best thing here is the friendly staff and cool interior.  It'd be a good joint for a 4th or 5th date. haha  Might see ya there!",

I have been to the Tempe and  Chandler location and both are consistently great.  Theirs burgers and O-rings are the bomb!  So stop going to those fast food chains and getting microwaved burgers! Just go to Habit you will not be disappointed! BTW, not sure why people think this place  is expensive? $7.20 for a double Char with fries and a drink. Not too bad in my book, unless you are used to the crap dollar menus at all those fast- food joints.",

The setting is very California - surfer pictures, palm trees set against an ocean view. I will say that the staff went above and beyond. They had staff constantly monitoring the dining area checking in to see how your meal was and if there was anything else they could get you. We went on a Saturday afternoon and it was packed! Not a lot of seats.",

    "text": "I'd heard good things about Habit Burger from SoCal natives so when I heard one was opening in Tempe, just down the street no less, I knew I had to try it. This is the first Habit Burger location in Arizona, but there are plans to open two more locations in Chandler and Phoenix by the end of the year.  The line to order was long. It's opening week so it was expected. We waited about 15 minutes to place our order. During the wait time the staff was passing out menus and making recommendations. Everyone was very friendly and helpful. Once we placed our order it only took about 5-10 minutes for our food to be ready.  We ordered the BBQ Bacon Charburger, The Chicken Club, sweet potato fries, and a half&half order of regular fries and onion rings. The burger prices here beat Smashburger by a mile. Only $2.95 for a regular burger, and our BBQ Bacon Burger was only $3.85. The owner informed us as we waited that all the burger patties are 1/5 lb. and cooked over an open flame. I asked my friend to rate the burger among In N Out, Smashburger, and Five Guys and he declared it better than 5G or SB, but not quite as good as In N Out.   I got the Chicken Club sandwich without bacon (making it technically not a club) and it comes on toasted sourdough bread, with heaps of fresh avocado (see my pic), lettuce, tomato, and mayo. I love avocado in a big way so I chose this sandwich over the other non-burger options which include a veggie burger, a tuna filet, and pastrami. Avocado lovers can add it to any sandwich or burger for a $1. Cheese can be added for $.50. The sourdough bread was really tasty. The chicken had great flavor, but I was somewhat disappointed in how wimpy the piece of chicken was. The whole breast was thinner than one slice of the bread!  Of the three sides we tried I liked the onion rings best. Super crispy and nice size pieces, plus they give you a side of ranch. Regular fries were very good too. The sweet potato fries fell short though, just not much flavor at all. I didn't even finish them. Also I think they must use an off brand ketchup because it didn't taste at all like Heinz to me. I love my Heinz.  There are kids meals available as well as milkshakes and malts. They also offer a few different salads which I will be back to try. I will definitely be back for that Chicken Club sandwich too, it was super good!",

Came up to the counter to order and I went with the Double Charburger with Sweet Potato Fries and an order of French Fries. It was really impressive how fast the food did come out. This Place seems to be a place for families and kids they were running all over. I rate the food as followed.  The Habit Double Charburger B+ Sweet Potato Fries B French Fries D+   It was a nice change in burger spots but will not make me change my #1 burger choice.",

The value is pretty good considering what other joints charge for similar fare.  The burgers are charbroiled and tasty, the onion rings are above-average, and the very reasonably priced side salad was far more and better than I expected for its price.  Close to work and will definitely make my regular lunch rotation.",
