Ramen is one of my favorite dishes and I try to try ramen all over Phoenix. So far, the spicy miso ramen here is still in my top three. I would have given them 5 stars 6 months ago, but I think their egg consistency had dropped a tad in recent past. The pork belly buns are also coming out a little stale lately. But I'm nitpicking. This place is a regular for me.",

If I were to rank the places in Phoenix who have the best ramen, it would be Tampopo, Posh (Tuesday nights), DOZO, and CherryBlossom Noodle Cafe.   I've had the Tonkotsu ramen, and the Soymilk ramen both with the braised pork belly, and it's superb. The noodles are a bit al dente but you know it's the real deal since they're made in house, and you can see the machine they make it with in the small room close to the entrance. The Hirata Buns are good too, as well as the Japanese fried chicken, the grilled squid tentacles, and the gyoza. All good appetizers. I'm looking forward to trying their rice and curry dishes. So, if you have a hankering for a hot bowl of ramen, get your fix at Tampopo! Yum!",

All broths based on Tonkotsu base, which is a pork based broth and in my opinion the best there is. Noodles are made in house daily. There are spicy and regular. I recommend getting the Pork Belly along with your Ramen and sitting at the bar, as the cooks were very friendly. Excited to see where this place goes in the future.",

They were tasty and flavorful. A bowl of ramen came generously with 2 pcs of Chashu & 1 whole boiled egg. It was also garnished with scallion, gobo root (good stuff). More importantly, the ramen is freshly made daily.  A couple of feedback to make it even better. First, I think the soup here is a bit watery. The additional $1 of rich soup didn't help. I hope they can take this oppty to improve the soup base. When it comes to ramen, soup is the most important ingredient. Second, I think the chashu meat was a little tough. It would be even better if they can make it softer.  On the other hand, I would rate it one of the top ramen restaurants in AZ. If the owner can improve on the 2 items above, I believe they will be comparable to Santouka, Tajima or Yamadaya in CA.",

I tried the Tonkatsu ramen (not really spicy enough) and the Spicy Tonkatsu ramen (bit too spicy), and both had good flavor. Luckily there's lots of customizable options for the ramen so I will make my Goldilocks-somewhat-spicy tonkatsu ramen next time.  The service was really friendly, and were always quick to refill my water glass when I needed it (the spicy ramen's fault).  The restaurant itself is in the strip mall behind the gas station on McClintock and Southern. Nothing fancy looking, but nicely renovated inside. Not a lot of seating, so large groups might not work well here - 4 or less should be easy enough.  I think they have sake in the fridge, but I wish they had beer.",

Given the name, I went in for lunch today with the bar set pretty high. I ordered the basic ramen because there is no chili oil and no add-ins to hide behind. It was amazing! The noodles had great texture and the broth was flavorful without relying on a ton of salt.   Unfortunately, I had to get back to work so I didn't have time for seconds. I could have easily put away another bowl or two.  I'm not saying portions were small because they aren't...it's just that good!  I am very happy that I live around the corner!",

I'd recommend sitting at the high table or the bar to avoid feeling like you're pushed against the wall at the awkward oblong couples tables, but forget that, you're reading this to hear more about the food.  I ordered the spicy miso ramen while the hubby got the seafood ramen. Completely different flavors with the seafood ramen being a milder, clear broth, while mine was an opaque-ish orange and obviously more spicy. Tons of noodles, broth to die for, but as I said before, lacking in meat. It was really tasty, don't get me wrong, so go in with the expectation of having good ramen with amazing broth and you won't be disappointed. Great for a cold, rainy day...when we get those.",

We were disappointed by the super limited vegetarian options. Bae described the soy milk broth as, \"not too creamy, perfect amount of spicy, but not delicious, just okay\". I was jealous that the dude next to us had steamed buns. I'll go back to try that! But bae doesn't want to come.... That's okay.",

Since its small they get packed quickly so expect to wait and it's a community table so I hope your up for random conversation unless you sit at the bar and you can see everything getting made. They do have a spicy ramen which I would not touch as it as flaming red but the guy sweating next to me said he enjoyed it .",

For the main course, we ordered ultra spicy ramen, spicy miso ramen, chopped pork over rice (chasyu don) and Japanese fried chicken over rice (karaage don). Everything tasted good except for the ramen, both of them. They look super delicious, but the broth was very bland. I have had better tasting ramen in the valley than this place.

In the end, it's a little lackluster. I had the tonkotsu. The broth lacked any real depth of flavor, the pork lacked tenderness, the noodles we're a little dense. It wasn't as bad as that all sounds. It was perfectly acceptable, but nothing special. I dinner with my boss, who had the ultra spicy ramen. He added fried chicken on the recommendation of our server. He enjoyed it, but ultimately felt the same as me: not bad, but nothing to get worked up about. He mentioned the ultra spicy was every bit as spicy as the name would suggest. Prices are reasonable. Service is a win. Madonna and the pop hits of the 80s playing overhead was a little odd. It won't change your life, but I'd recommend it if you were looking for a quick noodle fix and it was close.",

For example, I came here with my husband about a year ago, and the service was fast, friendly and efficient. Tonight, my husband decided to get me take-out because it would be good to have some soup while nursing an on-coming sickness, so he came in around 8:00pm. He placed his order and then he waited. In the time he waited, another person came up, placed their to-go order and left. My husband was wondering what was so complicated about our order of two Ultra Spicy Ramen that was causing the delay. At around 8:42pm, they asked him what he was waiting around for, and he had to remind them that he was waiting for his order. He was a bit outraged because there really wasn't an apology or an offer to give him something for the mix-up.  The food is better than your average ramen place like Ramen Republic or the Sobas where they make the noodles in house, but I wouldn't put it above Cherry Blossom Noodle Cafe in flavor of broth and authenticity of Japanese ramen.  Overall, I would say that the place is good if you're looking for a decent bowl of ramen.",

The reason for the 1 star is because my family ate there in the middle of the day, in June,  when the weather was well into the hundreds and as soon as we walked in the restaurant there was no immediate, \"ahhhh...\" feeling like we've escaped the inferno... NO, it was HOT in the restaurant. We decided to stay because my family love ramen and wanted to eat there.  After we all ordered I asked our waiter if they could please adjust the air... the waiter said, \"yes I've already talked to the owner about it, and I was told no.\" So we ate our soup with beads of sweat running down our faces. Again, the food was good but eating soup in the summer in a hot restaurant with the owner unwilling to adjust the air was not comfortable or appealing... I won't be back in until winter",

It's a small place with family style seating in the center and a few small tables alongside the wall. We opted for the bar seating to check out the making of it all. The braised pork is TO. DIE. FOR. Seriously, like what did they put in there...crack!? Love. Both of our dishes were glorious and perfectly spicy. If you haven't been here, it's worth the try!",

This was the first place that I visited when I landed in Arizona and I was extremely excited due to the reviews and their super spicy ramen with spicy noodles. However, their super spicy ramen was not spicy at all and it was bland. It's also overpriced & any meat or add ins you want to the ramen costs extra $. In addition, the place is very small and cramped. Needless to say, if I ever return to Arizona, I will not be coming back.",

While they do not take official reservations, they said that they would save an area for all of us to sit; what do you know, our table awaited us upon arrival! I really liked the long, communal table in the center of dining room, which made the restaurant feel more intimate. Yet, the decor was modern and fresh!   Next, it is a bonus to the dining experience when the restaurant makes their noodles in-house--big selling feature for me! Then came time to order; making a decision was difficult, as all the ramen options sounded pretty delectable! Finally landed on the Miso Ramen and was pleased with my decision; rich flavored broth and tasty accouterments such as the soft boiled egg and seaweed. Still, one friend's ramen were not entirely cooked and lay bunched up in a hard ball within her bowl.   Further, while our waitress did seem to be swamped with tables to wait on, I did not appreciate that our meals came without napkins. Though this is  not a \"big deal\", and we easily got up and fetched our own napkins, napkins are a basic requirement that should automatically be delivered with our food and silverware. Nevertheless, I enjoyed my experience and would definitely return!",

The pork buns are nothing special and the meat to bun ratio was not great (too much bun). Husband had the seafood ramen while I had the pork. No need to get the extra concentrated broth as the original has plenty of flavor (and is quite SALTY). Whoa, speaking of salt we felt overly bloated and tired after dining here I'm guessing it was a combination of MSG and salt or just salt if they do not use MSG (unsure of this).",

I give the space 4 stars. Even though the space is authentic, I'm American, and I like a little more room to slurp my ramen.   I had the seafood ramen with spicy paste, egg, and seaweed. The order came out quickly. It was more than I could eat. But if you're extra hungry, the menu mentioned $2 refills.   I would definitely go back.",

They're good, just a little different for me. The broth was delicious and so were the egg and the slice of pork that come with the Tonkotsu Ramen. The egg is cooked just as it should be, with a slightly runny yolk. I will likely be back to try a few more varieties of ramen. The service was good and there was no wait at about 5pm on a Thursday. I would recommend Tompopo to friends and family.",

So, we sat down at the rail and ordered some Tonkotsu Ramen and Takoyaki (a personal favorite of mine). While the Ramen wasn't the best over ever had - it was still damn good. The noodles were on point.   That said, the Takoyaki was delicious. It's the closest I've found to the real thing in Japan. If you don't like squid, however, these aren't for you.  We did like this place enough to bring my Mom and Sister back for a visit. This time I had a hirata bun, which I thought was good. On this visit the service was a bit lackluster, but we did wait 10-15 mins for a seat and the place was packed, with plenty more customers on a wait, so I don't hold this against them.   One thing that I rather enjoyed was the atmosphere. It has a feeling of a ramen shop in Japan, even though it is still much larger than many you'd find over there. The service and food was quick, as expected when it comes to ramen. Turns out after my brother and I left my extended family visited twice at different times. It's definitely worth your time and taste buds.",

All the food came out piping hot.  I had the Spicy Miso Ramen and it was good all the way to my soul, and bonus it cleared my sinuses. The broth was steamy and spicy with the perfect amount of salt, the pork was tender, egg cooked perfectly, and the ramen was not gummy. It was just a perfect bowl of deliciousness and very filling!   Here's a little tip ask for a fork if your uncoordinated, I tried to be cute and use chopsticks and had a major fail.",

The thin slice of meat was just sad for it to be 4 bucks for 1 serving.  The tonkotsu broth was sooooo light, it lacked flavor. The seasoned egg was only seasoned on the outside, and once you bite into it, lacks any flavor. The noodles texture was good and not over cooked but that has to be the only saving grace. I don't expect great ramen here but... ugh waste of calories. I'm sorry. Never coming back.",

    "text": "I like Tampopo, but it pales in comparison to a ramen joint I'd experienced in Chandler, as the broth didn't quite measure up to that fragrant, rich tonkotsu I was looking for.  It's neat that there are strips of bar and communal seating, and the chefs are visible as they prepare the noodles. Service was mediocre, as the waiters didn't seem to want to stop by and were always in a rush to leave.   Tonkotsu ramen: The noodles were a touch undercooked for me, and the broth was on the bland side. I did like the black garlic oil, and I ordered mentaiko on the side, which was nice with the broth. The pork wasn't anything special to me, and I could taste that it'd been prepared and refrigerated before serving (which is the norm I understand, as I've yet to come across a ramen place that didn't do this for preparation's sake). The egg was also rather overcooked and didn't have that soft runny center I love dipping noodles into. The bowl did come out piping hot, which I appreciate and never take for granted.   Curry ramen: I was surprised by how thick the curry here was, as other places I've had curry ramen usually have curry broth whereas here, it was thick curry similar to the kind served over rice. I didn't mind; I thought it was pretty good! Our waiter suggested pairing the spicy noodles with this curry, and I couldn't really tell the difference except that the noodles were a pinkish color. It's a nice option, but I don't think it makes too big of a difference. There were nice huge chunks of chashu here though, and I liked them better than the sliced version in the tonkotsu ramen.  Just a quick note that the tea here comes in cans, so unfortunately no complimentary refills. I may come back for a quick bite, and there's a Starbucks next door for a nice after-meal drink or dessert.",

We were on a 2 and a half day trip to Phoenix and after eating nothing but western food, I was craving Asian food. We had already been to Phoenix, Scottsdale and Sedona so we decided to give Tempe a try and was so excited to see ramen.   To get this out of the way,I did not come in here expecting great ramen....   The tonkotsu broth really needed more flavor... Pork flavor. I can forgive not having that great froth that comes with tonkotsu ramen, but this just tasted like powder and water and maybe some soy sauce. Not all bad though...The broth was hot which was great and the thin noodles were cooked to a firm texture. My egg was surprisingly close to perfect and the wood ear mushrooms and bean sprouts were appreciated. Pork was on the tougher side...  The bun was my least favorite thing. Bun to meat ratio was off and the sauce was sooo salty  Overall it met my expectations but if you're used to getting good Cali Ramen or legit Ramen from Japan, this place will do you dirty",

I sat at the side facing where they prepare the food. The chef is friendly, shouts when someone enters and says thank you and bye before you leave.

Adding a mouthful of peppers with a bite of pork reminisces more of fajitas than ramen to me. Bottom line it was just not for me. My boyfriend got the spicy shoyu ramen which was more in line with traditional ramen tastes.",

Last time I had ramen noodle was in LA and it terrified me from having it again. The broth was super salty that I couldn't taste anything else. But then....all of my yelper friends check in here and finally I decided to give this a try.   This restaurant isn't big, but it was full house this afternoon. Usually a indication of a good restaurant. We were lucky to find a small section of the table for the 4 of us. It took someone a while to clean up the table and to bring us menus. No matter - it is a brand new restaurant and they were crazy busy. Drink and food did take a while and they also forgot one of our appetizers. No one really came by to check up on us once. Nevertheless, the overall service was acceptable.   We ordered a Pork Bun and pork belly as an appetizer. The dough was super soft on the pork bun. The portion for pork belly was very small and a bit salty. Meat was tender and I did enjoy it. For entree, I ordered Miso ramen noodle (regular flavor). The broth was sweet and tasty. Unlike the saltiness that I had when I was in LA. The noodle was super fresh and I couldn't have enough of it.   I'll definitely come back here again to try different appetizer, ramen noodles and make more room for dessert. Thanks for opening up such a great place in Arizona.",

The bad: I was not as fond of the Ramen, the noodles are pretty chewy, the actual flavor of the pork is good but it is unfortunately dry. The broth was either too salty (in the case of my friend) or not salty enough like mine. Mine was good but not the best, unfortunately my friend's was too salty because of the addition of the burdock (some kind of thick paste was added along with it) to the point that she threw up after. Not a good way to end the night.",

I think the problem is that I am vegetarian and their veggie soup is nearly tasteless and almost makes you feel sick if you eat too much at once. I'd just like a vegetarian soup that isn't so heavy and soy milk based. Have always had a wonderful experience here when I come with friends though. Small, but very lovely.",

    "text": "Fact:  Justin Timberlake's hair in the 1990's was an unintentional advertisement for instant ramen.  More like subliminal messages.  Amirite?  Anyways, three of us came here for dinner on a lovely chilly Thursday night.  We were seated at the bar, front row seats to the magic noodle show [get your mind outta the gutter!] by an informative and cheerful waiter.  The three of us got a variety of items to share with each other.  We had ordered two Tako Wasabis, two Hirata Buns, an Agedashi Tofu, Tonkatsu Ramen with the rich soup upgrade, a Miso Ramen, and an Ultra Spicy Ramen.  Boy am I bloated.  Let's talk appetizers:  I originally wanted to get my beloved Takoyaki but the Takowasabi caught my eye.  I never had it before so I was mildly surprised when we received two martini glasses full of raw octopus with fresh wasabi and pickled ginger.  Any time a place has fresh wasabi, I'm all for it but man was it pungent!  That first bite packed a punch.  Like the Takowasabi was Holly Holm and I was Ronda Rousey.  I loved the raw octopus but that sour pucker from the ginger and the burning sensation from the fresh wasabi was pretty intense.  I wish the server told us that one ordered would have been enough for the three of us because we didn't even finish the second glass.  Next we had the Hirata Buns [steamed pork belly buns].  I assumed they would serve it like this place we went to in Las Vegas this past Saturday which is $3 for one bun.  Since only two of us wanted it, had I known they were served in pairs, we would have gotten just one order.  Granted, they give you two buns for $3 but they're relatively small.  I could have done without this because it didn't seem like they steamed the buns at all.  They were cold and cracking and not warm and squishy.  It made the first bite unpleasant.  I also wish there was an option to get regular Kewpie mayo instead of the spicy mayo.  The spicy mayo was delicious for sure but there was too much going on.  Kewpie mayo is more delicate and I think it's perfect for pork belly.  As for the Agedashi Tofu, these were good but not as crispy as I would have liked it.  Now I'm not going to get into all the different kinds of ramen we had in great detail but I will say that they were all pretty darn good.  We were informed that Tampopo has one of ten ramen pulling machines in the U.S.  They are the ONLY ones in Arizona with this contraption.  The noodles were cooked al-dente.  They held the delicious soup well and had great texture.  Any time a noodle can hold up the broth and flavor is a win in my book.  I also love how you can not only see the collagen floating in the broth but feel it sticking to your lips which is no easy feat as I had lipstick on.  The Rich Soup Upgrade (+$1) had a great amount of pepper I wasn't anticipating despite reading Yuko H.'s review but I didn't mind it that much.  I will admit that I wish the eggs were more runny.  I want to crack my egg in half and have the yolk turn my broth into more richness.  The cha shu was a bit on the tougher side as well.  I like my cha shu a little more fatty for the melt-in-your-mouth feel.  All in all, I had a pretty great meal.  I would love to try their Takoyaki and Curry Ramen next time.  Hands down a great ramen experience in Arizona.  I wish you great success, Tampopo!",

I showed up here on the most ridiculously busy Monday evening. I understood I would wait until there was an open spot at the bar, do I waited about ten minutes. Not bad.  Then I sat down, I had a corner spot but a waitress walked by me a lot and for twenty minutes she didn't speak to me. Then she brought me a menu and left. Ten minutes later I knew what I wanted but didn't see any servers available. Finally a taller, college age guy took my order and I asked for a water.  The food took almost thirty minutes. And I didn't get a water until after my food came. I ordered the spicy miso with rich broth and my partner ordered the tonkatsu with rich broth and braised pork. The spicy miso had an okay broth, the pork wasn't amazing, but atleast the egg was okay. The tonkatsu wasn't the best, it had the rich flavor added and I thought without it, it would be way to watery and bland.  The check took too long, and while I know times can be busy, it still sucks to have wait staff that have far too many people at a time to deal with. At that point there should've been a manager on the floor helping out.  I probably won't be back again. My thought is that I might try take out with them and see how it goes.",

    "text": "+ Rich Broth  + Noodles  + Good and Fast Service  - Pork was too fatty   Solid ramen place. I'm not too familiar with the ramen scene in the Phoenix area but in LA this holds up. I wouldn't say it's the best ever but it's solid with the flavor, richness, and creaminess of the broth, downside is it can be too creamy and a little salty and may over power the whole meal. I ordered the miso ramen and I love how the noodles were made al dente with the right amount of chewiness.   Also my slice of pork was all fat and about 5% meat. Not a huge fan of that. The meat I could bite into had a smokey taste and really helped stand out next to the broth.   Service was great and fast but then again I went right when it opened and not a lot of people were there. Ramen comes out quick!  If you like the broth thick and creamy, with al dente noodles this would be a good place to try out if you're in the area. Lots of parking in the plaza and you have access to the Starbucks wifi next door! I would come here again given the chance.",

But this place was decidedly average and I had really high hopes for it, especially since Phoenix is missing a truly great ramen shop. I felt the noodles lacked consistency and were overdone. It didn't have the springy, al dented feel you get when you dive into a real bowl of ramen. The cha sui was dry, thinly sliced and lacked flavor. The soup base, which is arguably the most important part of the bowl since it brings it all together and acts to unify the entire experience felt like it was just an after thought here. Just a simple soup base to keep the ramen warm. The egg was also fully cooked through. I am telling you, you haven't had egg until you've eaten a half boiled egg in spicy ramen broth.   Maybe this place deserves another chance but I live on the north west side of Glendale so I might not really be able to get another chance to stop by that way.",

    "text": "Tampopo makes their own noodles. Their broths and ramen bowls are generously sized and tastes great. I usually can't even finish a bowl. I've tried all the bowls there and you can't go wrong with the classic Tonkatsu ramen. The two spicy options are good when you want a jolt, though the Ultra Spicy can be so spicy that it covers up any other flavor. The Soy Milk ramen is a tad sweet (who'd thought haha). The Seafood ramen can be fun since the shrimp is whole so you gotta peel it.   The fried octopus balls are great appetizers. It's a tad crispy on the outside and gooey on the inside, with a small morsel of octopus that adds flavor. My boyfriend and I almost always get that when we go.  Another highlight is the braised pork rice bowl. It's a few pieces of fatty braised pork belly on top of white rice, with a side of artificial crab. A filling and quick to-go meal for when I don't want soup noodles. If you haven't tried it yet, please do!  Some things I steer away from: the Curry ramen, since it was bland when I had it. Also I watched the chef dump something from a package and add water to it which was disappointing. The Shisito peppers need work too, they were way too big and just plain flavorless.  I love watching the chefs work, and the entire restaurant team is on top of their stuff too.",

    "text": "Tampopo Ramen is a relatively new ramen shop that is probably inspired by the movie of the same name.  I don't care if this place is authentic or not, it's very original and the food is extremely good. Located on McClintock and Southern, I have gone here 5 times in the past 4 months. I find it extremely warming, the quality of food is superb. I hear they make their noodles fresh, the meat is excellent and the eggs are cooked to absolute perfection.  More about the eggs: I have never tasted eggs that well-cooked so consistently. They might have used a Sous Vide method to control the yolk temperature and mastered that because the eggs have a smooth and silky yolk when you cut through the perfect white.  During my time here, I've tried a variety of different dishes. My best advice is only get the noodle soup as my friend got the rice bowl and wasn't very impressed. They add pickled ginger to all of their soups which I find kind of strange, but it's ok to eat.  Tonkatsu Ramen - This standard 8 dollar ramen is the staple of the restaurant. Has the standard stuff like the pork, nori and egg. The broth is rich and you can tell by the creamy look, that it is balanced and well prepared. Curry Ramen - It's alright but not as good as the soup. It's basically Japanese curry stew with noodles. If you've ever had the curry blocks in Asian markets, it's pretty much that. The curry was alright, I would say even a bit cold, but I don't think I'd get this again. I think only the ramen soups for me.  Seafood Ramen- The seafood ramen includes onions, seaweed (nori), a good seafood broth, chewy fish cakes, and 3 beautifully deep fried prawns. The prawns stole the show for me because of how crispy they are. I could even eat the head but I did not want to freak out my guest. No egg in this one and I don't think I would eat regularly.  Fried Chicken - Tampopo's fried chicken reminds me a lot of Korean fried chicken which is awesome and doesn't exist in Phoenix. The chicken wings are extremely crunchy. The only disappointing thing I have with these chicken wings is that the sauce is kind of this watery soy sauce they drizzle on it. They need a thicker syrup.",

The egg was tasteless / definitely not flavored.. but cooked perfectly.. so.. it's not great, but far from bad. I feel the fact that the noodles were home-made and the broth was seasoned just right more than make up for the shortcomings of the Ginger and Egg...which are personal preference type things anyways. A+ ramen joint.. they do it right and it's ohhh so yummy!..Great job guys.",

Their inhouse noodles looked so perfect and was on the chewier side (which I liked), and their broth was decent.  A friend ordered hers with the rich broth add-on for an extra few dollars, but while it was slightly more flavorful, it looked like she had less broth than all of ours.  The basic broth is good too, and I don't think the rich broth added too much more to the experience.  Also, their takoyaki balls were mostly dough, so I was quite disappointed in that aspect.   Also, there's very limited seating here, so you'll most likely find yourself very close and intimate with your restaurant \"neighbors.\" You may have a short wait if you're coming in during their peak hours too.   Overall this place is one of the better ramen places I've tried in the Phoenix area, and it's definitely a place I'd go back to for my ramen cravings.",

Which isn't too much of a problem but it did make it a bit uncomfortable.   And then there was the food! As I said before I came in wanting to love it. I'll admit my expectations may have been high but after seeing the pictures on Yelp and reading some reviews I believe it was justified. I got the seafood ramen and let me say it looked good. As soon as I got it I dug in. The soup was rich, the noodles were good (not overcooked and soggy), and the seafood was cooked pretty well. My first few bites were superb, but the more I ate the less satisfying it became. And in the end there was another unavoidable fact. The servings were fairly small :(. I have to sadly report I walked out less than satisfied.   And lastly the cost. For what u got I feel like it was a bit expensive for not enough food. I think the quality was good enough but in the end it just wasn't satisfying.   Given this if someone I was with wanted to go there I would probably go with them but I don't think I'd go by myself.",

    "text": "Was absolutely thrilled to hear about a new ramen opening up, even if it was all the way in Tempe I was determined to try it!  Bright, small, enclosed ramen shop located next to a Starbucks in a plaza. The shop was not crowded at all during dinner. It was new, so I figured it would be okay.  I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen and an order of Takoyaki. The Spicy Miso Ramen had ginger, miso paste, green onions and charshu. I ordered an egg to go with it. As for Takoyaki, it is a fried ball with octopus and pickled ginger on the inside.  Yes, Takoyaki, yes! This definitely takes me back to the amazing Takoyaki I get at ramen places back in California's South Bay. Slightly crisp and browned exterior and filled with a hot, fluffy texture and piece of octopus that has a good chewy, bite. Great flavor and generous with the bonito flakes! The ramen on the other hand was a bit disappointing. The broth was good, but lacked complexity in flavors which is surprising as miso is savory, salty and has a unique flavor about it. The broth also was not spicy and was brought up to the attention of my server to verify if it was indeed spicy miso, there was no spice detected in the ramen at all. The charshu was cut thickly and incredibly chewy and lacked a roasted edge. Noodles made in house and were chewy, but stick straight (personally not a stick straight noodle gal) but the texture was decent and made up the majority of the bowl. Toppings didn't do much to accent the ramen and eggs are not included in the ramen, they were of additional cost and are marinated hard boiled eggs. All in all, I didn't enjoy the ramen as much as I would have liked. I would return to try their non-ramen choices though!  The service was good in that the staff was attentive and answered questions I had, many of the servers were young but provided great service. The place is clean, but small as mentioned before but not overly loud- good environment for dining.  To make things short, yes to Takoyaki and no to ramen here for me.",

The bamboo tasted salty but slightly sweet which kind of threw me off. The egg that's usually soft boiled was hard boiled. It also had pieces of pink ginger, the kind you'd eat with your sushi in the ramen which was kind of weird. Husband had the tonkatsu ramen which was bland. The noodles itself were decent though but we generally prefer wavy noodles. Service was good. Disappointed and don't think we'll be back.",

Flavor is rich and noodles are firm.  Some of ramen places I have visited, either broth is flavorless or noodles are too soft. It is hard to get perfect in both areas.  But here they got it right.     I'm used to eating at popular ramen joints in California, so my taste buds are little spoiled.  But this place is the only thing that is closest to it.   Place is small and tight. So expect place to be packed when visiting.",

    "text": "Pretty legit for AZ ramen.   The tonkotsu broth wasn't as rich as other ramens I've had (like in Cali) but it was still quite flavorful. The noodles had a nice, chewy texture and the garlic oil added a little extra kick. The pork belly slice had just the right amount of char; you can see them cook it with a blowtorch behind the bar! Try the tonkoktsu with added sweet corn and bamboo shoots to up the level of the taste!   We also tried the steam buns and they were tasty, but nothing exceptional. The sauce and pork belly (same meat as in the tonkotsu) made a great pair,  but the meat to bun ratio was a little off - too much bun, not enough meat.   The menu is small and fairly limited - not much else offered aside from ramen and standard Japanese apps (takoyaki, gyoza, etc).   This is a small space and always fills up around standard mealtimes. Seats at the bar and tables. Better for smaller groups given the limited space.   Service is prompt and efficient, pretty friendly but don't expect them to hover. Someone checked on us once after we got our food  and that was it, which is fine given how busy this place usually is.   TL;DR - Food - solid 4/5 - Service - can't complain - small interior - limited menu",

    "text": "I was watching a YouTube video about 2 guys who were \"noodle masters\", which got me very hungry so my husband and I grabbed our son and came here because of all the good reviews, not out of convenience, trust me.  Anyway, we get here and thankfully I'm a little person because this place is pretty crammed with both people and tables in such a small place. We figure, \"Whatever, we didnt come here to go furniture shopping, we came for the food.\" So we sit down and look at the menu.  First thing I notice is all the ramen has pork in it. Our son and I don't eat pork. So I ask the waiter if they dont mind substituting the pork for their fried chicken even if it costs extra. He looks at us annoyed and says, \"We cannot substitute it but we can remove the pork and charge $3 for the fried chicken to be put in instead.\" I look at my husband and ask, \"Is that not what I asked?\" Not to make our waiter feel stupid but I was thinking maybe I worded my question wrong, but my husband looks at him and asks, \"So you can substitute the pork for chicken for a $3 charge?\" The waiter looked even more annoyed but to stop a big debacle from taking place in front of our son, I just said, \"Yes, okay. Please remove the pork from mine and my sons and add chicken, that's fine. Thank you.\"  The food came out fairly quickly and we had forgotten all about our little miscommunication with the waiter earlier and were having a good time. Took a bite of my food and it was a little salty but, oh my word, the chicken was delicious. There were only 3 little chicken nugget sized chickens in a big bowl so I savored every bite. My son, who is an 11yr old seasoned ramen eater, enjoyed his Miso soup very much. My husband didnt spend much time talking to us once he got a taste of his spicy ramen soup so I can only assume that his empty bowl a couple of minutes later meant he also enjoyed it.  So overall, great food just plan on overhearing everyone else's conversation because that person will most likely be sitting on your lap anyway. And don't be discouraged by the waiter if he gives you a little bit of an attitude, the food is worth it and everyone has bad days.",

We came here because some friends highly recommended this place.   We started with Karaage and Takoyaki.  We then ordered seafood ramen, miso ramen and tonkatsu ramen.    The service was good. The noodles were excellent.  The broth was good but not fantastic.  It lacks the richness and deep flavor that makes good ramen so good.  The Tonkatsu ramen was saved because we ordered an extra kakuni the braised pork bellie for $3. This was excellent.  The chashu that came with the ramen was lack luster.  The Karaage at $7 was not a great deal.  Takoyaki was excellent and the dancing Bonita flakes caught the attention of all the people sitting near us.   Considering this is Arizona and ramen options not at the level of Southern California, Las Vegas or Austin, I gave it 4 stars because it is a legit ramen joint.   The bathroom was clean.",

Everyone greeted us in Japanese when we arrived and when we left which was a nice touch and exactly what EVERY True Japanese Ramen bar does in Japan.  They have table seating and bar seating if you want to see the behind the scenes with the cooks.  We opted to sit at the bar to see all the goodies they're churning out.  I ordered the Ultra Spicy Ramen and my fiance the Spicy Miso.  Don't let the name fool you as none of them were that spicy.  Mine left a nice zing to the pallet but I wasn't downing glasses or water and calling my mommy for help.  My fiance even asked for some chili oil to up the intensity of hers.  Regardless of the spicy level, the ramen themselves were very good.    My favorite of the whole experience was the chashu pork.  They are made in house, cooked, sliced and then flame charred with a torch to put on a nice layer or crispy deliciousness.  By far the best I've ever had.  Second thing I'd have to commend these guys on is the egg.  Most if not all the other ramen bars I've been to only gives you half an egg.  Here you get a whole one.  First time ever I left a ramen bar feeling full.  Great job guys, keep up the good food",

Rice bowls are small portion but even cheaper. Tonkotsu or soymilk ones are not spicy at allmaking it little bland. I recommend getting bakudan (hot paste  sauce) to add some spice into your broth if it is too mild for your taste. Their noodles are the best and the broth is rich and thick. Personally not a big fan of their chashu since it is little chewy than soft by not boiling but torching. But I think their unique style. I still prefer getting soft pork on the side though.",

Everything I've tried so far has been amazing -I always love to add menma, but I'd be happy enough with just the basics of soft boiled egg and slice of pork... it's really the broth that makes their ramen so great in comparison to any other place I've tried in Arizona!   They've always been crowded when I've come, so be prepared for a bit of a wait. It's definitely worth it tho, or you could always do take-out! Also, while I think their portions are pretty generous, you can add extra noodles at like no cost (or maybe $1 at most?).   My only advice would be to stay away from the optional hot sauce -it's like $1 but just tastes synthetic.. like there's only an extreme spice but no added flavor. That's the only thing that's not really worth it imo :)",

    "text": "After hearing about this place. I finally had the chance to try it and I gotta say I'm not all that impressed. We came on Sunday afternoon and was seated quickly as it wasn't crowded yet. Our server was great, he was quick to getting drinks and our orders. My first thought while waiting was \"Oh great they serve nice large bowls for the price!\" It was only then after getting our meals my ratings went down for the place. I had ordered the Tonkotsu ramen with additional chasyu (roasted pork) and Tampopo original spicy paste.  First look into the bowl I see it is only half full of broth, next was that even with additional pork there was a total of 3 slices. I was expecting the normal bowl to already include 2-3 slices since the description says there are\" slices of roasted pork\" (plural) therefor I should have at least 4-6 slices total. Also each slice was 70-90% fat, what a waste of $3. The extra $1 for the tampopo original spicy paste is also a joke. Smelling the paste I instantly thought of the spicy korean paste you can buy at the asian markets (1lb tub for about $7). It was given to me on the side in a little 2oz condiment cup with maybe about 1 tea spoon of the paste and charged me a dollar for that.  Overall my experience wasn't too bad the ramen was cooked nicely and the flavor was good but the pricing is what really gets me. I think they need to do some price adjustments if they expect more repeat customers.  Side note heard last night some elderly woman ran her car into the restaurant and will be closed for a few weeks. I hope everyone is not harmed, and have a good christmas.",

    "text": "Just went here for the first time and the food met my expectations. I ordered the Spicy Miso Ramen with the braised pork belly topping. My girlfriend ordered the Japanese Style Curry. We also ordered two Hirata Buns. The Hirata Buns came out first and we gobbled those up within seconds, they were super tasty and something we will order next time we visit. The \"with mayo\" part in the description of the Hirata Buns was almost enough for me to avoid ordering them but they add to the flavor nicely. My ramen was awesome, loved the roasted pork along with the hard boiled egg. Overall the broth and noodles were packed with flavor and my girl really liked the wooden spoon that came with the bowl. She ordered a small size curry bowl and it was ok, not something I would order when coming to a place known for ramen but it did taste like a decent curry dish and it was the perfect size for her.   We ordered two different desserts to try. One order of the Dorayaki (rounded sweet red bean) and one order of mango and vanilla Mochi Ice Cream (pounded rice ice cream). The star of the dessert round was for sure the Mochi. One problem I had with the Dorayaki was that they were made and then either frozen or refrigerated because they came to the table ice cold. They are basically a red bean paste sandwiched in between two little pancakes and the cold really brought down the flavor of the bean. If they served that dessert warm it would make a big difference. Another big issue with the desserts were the fact that they were both topped with whip cream and chocolate syrup which did absolutely nothing but mask the flavors. Don't get me wrong I love whip cream on stuff but just because something is considered a dessert doesn't mean it should automatically be covered in whipped cream. Do yourself a favor and request your dessert with no whip cream or the chocolate syrup, I guarantee they will taste better. My girlfriend simply scooped off the whipped cream to the side and we dug into those Mochi balls like there was no tomorrow. For those who don't know they are ice cream balls covered by a thin pounded sticky rice outer layer. One thing that could be an issue for some is the size of the place is fairly small and everyone is seated in pretty tight spaces so if eating close to strangers bothers you then try coming in when they are not busy (if there even is such a time lol). With fall and winter coming up I see us coming here for ramen bowls and mochi whenever we are in the area.",

    "text": "Being a bit of a ramen snob, I would still give Tampopo a solid 4 stars. Good. Acceptable. The best? No. The best in Arizona? Maybe. Arizona is lacking ramen spots lol so definitely a maybe.  Whatever you do, I advise you to PLEASE order your bowl of ramen with an additional $1 RICH broth. Their regular broth without the \"rich\" factor completely lacks flavor & texture. You aren't getting the full experience of how flavorful ramen should be without the added \"rich\" factor. Please take my word for this.  I'm a huge tonkatsu lover & the only reason I did not order their basic tonkatsu is because my fellow Yelper friend Rich advised me that their miso here was better than their tonkatsu. He was entirely right. I paid an additional $1 for the rich broth because I feared driving all the way out to Tempe just to receive a bland bowl of ramen. Hallelujah, the best $1 I've spent as an addition to a bowl of ramen.  I had their spicy miso ramen (with the rich broth for an additional $1 + nori - seaweed for an additional $1). Delicious! The broth was really good. I've had better, yes, but I really gotta give it to Tampopo for their spicy miso. Well done! The noodles were made beautifully. Possibly one of the best in-house made noodles I've ever had (I've tried over 20+ different ramen houses, so I think that sorta says a lot). The egg was I believe supposed to be soft boiled, but was a tad overcooked. The pork was a bit tough for my liking, but it had great flavor. My cousin got the regular tonkatsu. I decided to give her broth a try because I tend to lean towards that when it's my first time at any ramen house. Unfortunately...... it wasn't good. It was bland. The broth had no texture. It lacked flavor. I was a bit confused given that the miso broth they serve is a tonkatsu based miso broth. Yet the flavors were totally lacking and unbalanced as tonkatsu alone. I believe the reason for such a huge difference in broths was the added \"RICH\" broth? It really seems like the only explanation for it. Tampopo should highly consider boosting their regular tonkatsu broth by adding a bit of their rich broth just to bring out more flavors & give it a stronger kick. The regular tonkatsu broth was really lacking.  Side note: The bowl of spicy miso rich broth was as flavorful as regular bowls of ramen in Los Angeles. So if you want the True strong flavors of ramen, please, spend the extra 4 quarters on a tasty rich broth.  OVERALL: if I'm visiting family in Arizona, I'll come back & have Tampopo if I need a ramen fix. The rich spicy miso ramen is a solid choice. I would opt out on getting any regular broths unless they decide to boost the flavors of it. Thasssss jusssss my opinion :-)",

The ramen wasn't the best I'd ever had but pretty damn close. The broth was very flavorful and rich.   We ordered appetizers and ramen. The server brought both at the same time. My better half sent his ramen back because he wanted to enjoy his octupus (which was delicious) first without the ramen getting cold. I wasn't in the mood to squabble with the server, so I just took everything. By the time my husband finished his octopus, I was done with my ramen. Since I was finished eating, he did not want to eat on his own. The server told him since he ordered the ramen, he would have to pay for it. The server offered to let him take it home, but ramen noodles sitting in the broth? How gross and mushy would that have been later? We told him we were not going to pay for it since we did not eat it. Their failure to pace the meal properly was not our fault. The owner/manager didn't even have the nerve to come tell us herself or even apologize.  Needless to say, we will never be back. It's a shame they lost a customer over $8.",

We ordered a plate of takoyaki, a spicy miso, and a soymilk ramen.  The takoyaki was the freshest I've had in Arizona--octopus was not too chewy, batter was cooked just right. Sometimes, restuarants make it too gooey, tasteless, or chewy, but Tampopo gave us none of those issues.  The spicy miso soup was excellent--try this if you like spicy, but have never been here before. If you want spicier, come back next time to amp up the heat with their ultra spicy ramen!  The soymilk ramen was also excellent--light, and not as meaty as the tonkotsu broth, but tasted just as creamy. It was not disappointing.  The noodles are not the typical curly noodles, they are thinner. Unfortunately, I do not enjoy these types of noodles in my soup, but for others, it may be their favorite. Hence, the 4 stars--good, but didn't go well with the bowl.   We have leftovers, and the broth was even more delicious the second night!",

    "text": "So I feel the quality has gone a bit since I last visited, or I was just there on an off day, but I still immensely enjoyed my rich broth tonkotsu ramen sans onions and sprouts with some added corn.   I think the main difference was the braised pork belly appetizer I ordered, it wasn't crispy at all and just kinda.. there.  The taste was pretty close to what I remember but the texture wasn't doing it for me, and that is what makes this place my fav.   Other than that, the broth was delicious and I even ordered some of the fried chicken to try out in the soup.. was a good choice, especially with the pork belly mishap.. the included chashu pork melted into my mouth via the silly wooden spoons, and the half boiled egg made it all worth it.   Until next time!",

I got my usual spicy miso ramen, but after trying someone else's tonkotsu, I think that might have been tastier. Also, big mistake in not getting the pork belly. I tried my cousin's and it melted in my mouth...but really, who am I kidding? I'm a slut for all bellies, especially pork. The egg in my ramen was a bit overdone, but my brother's was about right. The egg could also have used more marinating, in my opinion. We also got a steamed bun as an appetizer--there was wayyyy too much sauce, which overwhelmed the other flavors for me.  The space is a bit cramped and the seating is not the easiest to sit in and maneuver. You might have to wait a bit to be seated (especially if your party is large), but there's a Starbucks right next door if your wait is bad.",

I found the bun itself tooo doughy though - def could use some work on texture.  Now for the ramen (3 types): Noodles, good - just the right amount of firmness.  Egg, great! - nice and gooey inside  Broth, tonkotsu all the way. I tried the spicy miso and miso, and all my friends and I agreed tonkotsu was the best of the broths.  Pork belly, meh (confirmed after I ate mine and my friend's miso pork belly - wow, do I eat a lot....). I liked the extra crispy edges but the insides were lackluster for me. I also personally like a thinner pork belly.  Overall, the meal was enjoyable, but I don't feel any particular desire to rush back here and try more items over exploring other places around my new home!",

After checking out the menu, I went with a Spicy Miso Ramen, it had pork, bean sprouts, hardboiled egg, and scallions and spices. The broth had good flavor, and the noodles where perfectly cook, it just wasn't spicy like I had hoped it to be.  Service was good and friendly, we sat at the bar and watched everything be cooked, our bowls of ramen did sit there for a few before being served, thought about getting it myself, but resisted. Even though it sat, it was still very hot when it came to us.  If you are in the mood for ramen, this is one of the better ones I have found in the valley, swing by and give them a try, they are always busy, but the wait isn't that bad.",

The first time I went over a year ago I had the ultra spicy ramen. The broth was bright red so I figured it probably had a nice kick to it, but I personally didn't find it very spicy at all. The roast pork wasn't bad and the noodles had good texture.   The next few times I went I tried the miso ramen, spicy miso ramen, and tonkotsu ramen. The roast pork and ramen noodles remained consistent, but I found the broth pretty bland.  Overall not my favorite ramen spot in the area. Sometimes there's a bit of a wait and it gets pretty cramped at times. I also found hair in my takoyaki one time so that was fun.",

Let's start at the beginning, we waited outside in the cold because we were early, fine, no big deal.  But when we and another party both entered the restaurant around 5 minutes before open, remind you - the door was open - we can hear the staff mumble to each other about how they are not open yet.  One waiter informs us that they are not open and that if we wait they will be ready in a few, alright, we were fine with that, although it could have been phrased slightly better with a proper welcome, have a seat, like sophisticated cultured staff would do.  Kitchen staff who didn't communicate directly with customers are seemingly nice and concerned about getting the food out to the customers.  In fact the cook had to call over the waiter twice to have our food delivered.  Finally when we were ready to leave our food was not picked up and no check brought, so one of us went to inquire if we should pay at the register - me.  This is where we meet the rude long dark hair uncouth waiter.  He informs me in rude manner that I don't have to visit the register and like any other restaurant they can bring a check.  I apologized and said we were unsure and this was our first time at the restaurant,  he was not impressed, I waited for a minute assuming he would print the check since I was standing there.  Finally he prints the check and abruptly hands me the check.  He walks off and I proceed to separate mentally my portion of the check from my companions, now rude waiter returns and asks if I 'wanted it separate' - not a polite offer mind you but a more matter of fact, he shouldn't be bothered attitude.  I said yes please that would be better since we had three persons.  He then mumbled about how \"you could have said that earlier\".  Then before I could open the check envelope to see that there were three separate checks, he asks \"did I want him to bring it to us to the table too\"  I said yes, because I thought he still had the other two checks.  He now proceeds to throw up his hands in the air, and huff and puff.  I gave the separate checks to my companions as it were, since we now had separate checks.  This is a case in point of how a waiter should not be, I recommend that this staff member be reprimanded or possibly fired.  This is the epitome of rudeness and incivility.  If the owners are aware of this behavior they should be embarrassed.  I will not be returning here strictly for the malevolent nature of the service staff.    Kudos to the cooks since the food was still pretty good, but frankly, the service does not invite another visit.  Unbelievable, that service like this must be tolerated, anywhere.",

IT's a generous portion and if you are still hungry, you can refill with another round of noodles for just $2 . Had the pork bun as an appetizer which was delicious too. Will be a regular here for the monthly ramen fix.",

Took them 10 minutes to come greet us for water... We ordered a 16oz beer they gave us a 12 oz that was poured half foam and still charged us for the 16oz. They forgot to put in half our order we had to ask several times where the appetizers were and neither of the servers recalled even us having ordered any even though she wrote down our order. I ordered a spicy miso and got a regular miso. What is worse is they delivered our order to the wrong table then proceeded to give us the cold order that was sitting with some other couple. That is not sanitary! We had to ask for ones that weren't sitting on someone else's table how do I know the other table didn't play with that food? The girl said she couldn't split the check in half because the system won't do that but being in the restaurant biz I know for a fact that square has that capability. They also used Lysol spray to clean the tables which I don't think is up to code since the fumes were very potent and that was not pleasant to have blow my way while I was eating. Basically the experience was extremely frustrating and crazy unpleasant it's a shame because the food was good. The money was no where near worth it. 50 bucks can get u a better experience somewhere else. Only reason not 1 star is because food was good.",

I ordered the Spicy Miso with extra pork and the flavor and seasonings were perfect. The half egg was also cooked just right with the yolk not too hard. The portion size was more than I could eat so I had leftovers for later. The place is small but clean and well managed. This is must visit for those of you that like Ramen. Kudos to the staff for their excellent service. I'll be back but that's not a threat, lol.",

Plenty of places in LA and have even found it in Vegas, but having tried a couple of the PHX places people mention in this comment section, I haven't found a place I'd go back to a second time. Tampopo is the best ramen house in the Phoenix area, safe to say that, but would I make the trip from Glendale to Tempe for it again? Nope. Have seen some complaints on here about the noodles, the egg, the service...I'm not too picky about that, but what I need is a real Tonkatsu style, deep tasting broth. This place doesn't have it, even though I got the extra deep $1 add. The pork also left something to be desired, but I don't eat ramen for the pork, so not a huge issue. I wonder if part of what's going on in Phoenix is that restaurants are trying to appeal to a wider audience, so they dumb down the broth. It doesn't make sense that there wouldn't be at least one adequate bowl of ramen to be found here. I'll keep trying to find it though....",

The wait staff wasn't very attentive and screwed up my entire tables orders. The seafood ramen wasn't very good at all. The shrimp wasn't devained so blood from it got all the place. The noodles were the weirdest noodles I've ever had and the taste was strange. The prices were high for the quality of food I received.

I understand every restaurant's recipe is different, but all the tonkotsu ramen I've had in the past (couple different restaurants) had a creamy taste and this one was just heavy on the pork flavor. Not bad, it's just not what I'm into.  I love that they offer to give you another 'round' of noodles for just 2 bucks because I love noodles!",

On our visit, we ordered: Hirata Bun - I dream of Ippudo NY's pork buns and even though I didn't expect it to taste as good as theirs, I was hoping it would help ease that craving a little bit. It was not even close. I did not enjoy anything about this. The roast pork was very mild, the bun wasn't as soft and was way too big for the amount of pork in it. The sauce not only did not work with the flavors, but there was also too much of it.   Tonkotsu Ramen - Broth was just okay. I felt like it was missing something. The ingredients in it were good, though. We added braised pork belly & bamboo, which were surprisingly really tender and tasty. There was ample amount of noodles. We also ordered an extra side of it, but it was not necessary.    Karaage Chicken Rice Bowl - Heaps amount of rice and a small portion of chicken. There's more chicken in an 8 piece box of nuggets at Chick Fil-A! & I paid $2 extra for the \"large\" bowl. I can't even imagine the portion of the small one. The chicken was pretty good along with the pickled green veggies that accompanied it. Even though I took a spoonful of rice with each chicken piece, in the end I was still left with enough rice to fill 3/4 of the bowl.   It's not a place I would rush back to eat again. Service was pretty good. Nothing bad but nothing remarkable, either. They had way too many staff for the amount of customers and the small size of the place. Majority of the time, they were just standing around chatting with each other.",

I have yet to try their other dishes, but I can't seem to get away from the char siu tonkotsu ramen.... And I LOVE the name!

The place is pretty small so I felt trapped in especially since it was pretty busy when we went and it felt like they seated everyone in the same spot and left the front of the restaurant empty. But the most important thing is the ramen! I can't get over how delicious it was!",

We walked in to an almost empty restaurant but also saw they make the noodles in-house, so we kept walking. We found a table we liked and our server came over right away. She was very sweet and gave great service. Now onto the ramen we both got the spicy pork the pork was burnt and rubbery and the whole meal was simply unappetizing to look at. We both finished just the noodles and left. We recently saw Umami has a new location in Tempe and can't wait to give them our business again. Sorry this place just wasn't for us.",

It does get busy here so if you're first world stressing about waiting then go to the Starbucks next door and get your mocha latte whatever to help you de-stress.  But seriously this place rocks.  Quick friendly service from all the service staff there.  Writing reviews for me is based on multiple experiences and this place has me as a regular.  I visit 2-3 times per week not because its convenient but for the fact that I can run into, crush some house made broth,ramen and other goodness then peace out feeling satiated.  The portion size is spot on along with the overall feel for the restaurant welcoming and space warp to japan noodle shops.  After returning from Japan I feel they captured that trend and overall have a loyal customer as they've always maintained the consistency since I've been going.",

Unfortunately, 2 weeks ago I was in Torrance CA (where Toyota and Honda both have their US headquarters) and had dinner at Izakaya Hachi where the tonkatsu for the shabu-shabu absolutely blew me away.  Thick, creamy, fatty, it coated everything that went in the pot. The tonkatsu here, while better than almost anything to be found in Phoenix, simply didn't compare; nor did the karaage. The noodles were very fresh but not as springy as one might expect; definitely a step below the hand pulled noodles at China Magic Noodle House in Mesa.  The pork was a little more well done than I would like, but the soft boiled egg was perfect. All in all, a solid bowl of ramen, especially for Phoenix.  I'll be back.",

The ramen came out well before the starters and, as other reviewers have said, the broth was flavorless. Even compared to other ramen places in Phoenix this was bland and watery.  I added corn ($2) which ended up being a small portion of canned corn.  Both of the apps were just OK.  The hirata buns could have been much better with less mayo and no lettuce and there was way more dough than octopus in the takoyaki.  Service was also mediocre.  There were only a couple of servers for the entire place so things  just slipped through the cracks. It was impossible to get a refill on water and the servers kept asking what we were waiting on.  I overheard other tables asking for items that never showed up to be taken off the bill.    Next time I have a ramen craving I'll go back to Dozo.",

    "text": "After a challenging upper body workout my best friend and I had a ramen craving. Before Republic Ramen had been or go-to but recently his loyalty shifted to Tampopo.Tampopo is more authentic with J-pop and authentic japanese toppings. However I hate to say it but Republic satisfied my ramen needs much better. I must note, the staff agreed to seat us about 6 minutes after their 3pm lunch break. If you didn't know their head chef takes a break for two hours starting at 3.  First off, the Onigiri was bad. The rice was dried out and the topping was composed primarily of pork fat. How did this even make it on to my plate? Literally 60% fat 40% pork. I didn't want to ruin my friends regular status   and start some bad blood... but when every other bite contains small cubes of pork fat the $4.00 I spent on it was not worth it. This was a huge disappointment which was probably the staffs way to get back at me for cutting in to their 2hour break.  The pork ramen was solid, if a bit underseasoned. The portion was skimpy compared to Republic and the broth was not as hot as it should be. I liked the seasoning on the pork, but like the broth the pork was well under temperature. I took a sip of my friends extra spicy ramen and enjoyed the broth a lot more. Maybe I will order that next time. I paid  for a mushroom upgrade but they tasted like dirt marinated cabbage. Diners should also factor in that this is full service, and tips are required for this dining experience making my check cost more than Republic.",

I'd noticed they offered \"rich soup\" (more concentrated soup) for a dollar extra, and it's definitely worth it. It adds much more flavor and I'd recommend it to anybody stopping by. I never order ramen here without it. All in all, I really enjoy this place, and I'd rate it in the top 2 with Umami (which is currently closed) for best ramen in the area.",

I'd almost describe it as a \"dairy-drowned ramen\" that's more reminiscent of an overly wet fettucini alfredo than the Japanese brothy wonder we know and love. Their non-vegetarian options looked and smelled fantastic, so I'll give them the benefit of the doubt that they'll eventually figure out a better vegetarian option. Until then, though, definitely not recommended for the vegetarian crowd. One star added back for noodles that were admittedly pretty damn good, even if they happened to be drowned in a deluge of dairy.",

Some people would say it doesn't have any flavor, but it was okay. The gyoza was delicious and the pork buns were a little bit spicy. I'm used to saimin which has thicker noodles, so the thin noodles were a bit different for me. The pork in the ramen was a bit burnt, but you get passed that, still alright. I'd go back here every once in awhile, but it wasn't good enough to drag me back every weekend. My brother got the extra spicy ramen and my uncle received the spicy ramen, the regular spicy definitely isn't as spicy as you would think. Extra spicy probably has sriracha in it because it made the noodles super red. They both said it was decent, but they rather have the miso or ton ramen next time. Still a good place.",

We used the shared table and the design is really the only criticism I have with this place.  The food was delicious.  The ramen (Tonkotsu) is what I remember in Japan, and they had the lemonade in the bottle that I've not been able to find in any other asian food store.  I would highly recommend the gyoza as a side as well.  Come early in the evening to avoid any waits as it doesn't really look like there is a good place to wait for a table.",

I looooove ramen, and I was so excited to discover a good ramen place near me. And when I'm feeling lazy, it's on doordash too! I'm from Minneapolis, where there seems to be no good ramen places in sight, so I'm always deprived when I go home from college.  The restaurant itself is very small, and usually has a lot of people trying to get a table. Going here with big groups isn't really possible, but it really makes it feel like a genuine ramen place. The ramen is so good! I like the spicy miso one. If you don't like spicy, this is fine for you, it really isn't that spicy. I actually get it without pork, and it's still really good. And omg, you have to try their Japanese rice balls. I don't even know what's in them, but wooooow. I constantly crave those things. I'm pretty positive they have take out as well, so you can always take it to go. Love you tampopo!",

Super friendly service and I really enjoyed watching the ramen master chefs get after it.  No lean six sigma guys needed here, these guys are as lean as it gets in their operation.  Ordered the Ultra Spicy Ramen and had a short trip to fire heaven enjoying that absolutely beautiful orangey-reddish broth!  They have the option to extend the life of your ramen broth with extra noodles \"kae dama\" but I passed on that given the initial serving was plenty.  I paired it with iced Green Tea and the day couldn't have been better.  Kanpai!",

Sometimes I add in Kakuni (pork belly) in the ramen. This can be a hit or miss - sometimes it's tender, other times the meat is dry. I never have issues with their Takoyaki (octopus) - always good!   It's a pretty tiny location, but I've never had to wait over 5-10 minutes. You may end up sitting with a stranger, but personally I don't mind it.

The tonkatsu ramen broth was so light that it was overpowered by an ungodly amount of white pepper that just dominated (and not in a good way). The pork was delicious and tender, so that was a plus, but the egg was a little bit over cooked and not quite marinated long enough. There were way too many noodles (though nice and toothsome still) for the broth (at least in my bowl), and the bean sprouts were weirdly watery, and I probably wouldn't get the karagee again either. Man, I wish I had better things to say because it seems to be really liked! I think probably one of the miso broths would be better since the broth is really light and that would amp it up a bit, as would something spicy.   The shishito peppers were good as an appetizer though, but take note of the larger portion size if you're just one person!",

Ok maybe some don't and maybe it's not their thing but if you are having ramen in Arizona Tampopo is probably one of the better places you can go to.   I may not be giving it its full praise only because I have had some really good ramen in the past but again for Arizona this is great.   The atmosphere of Tampopo is pretty cool. You get the small cozy feeling as it is a small place and tightly packed with patrons. The likely hood is that it's like this in Japan or maybe even smaller so I have an appreciation for that.   They had a lot of employees and wait staff which is awesome because the food came out quickly and our glasses were kept filled.   We tried the Japanese chicken and it was delicious. Not dry. Not hard. Not undercooked. Just right.   The hirata bun was great too. My first time trying it and it didn't disappoint.   Now on to the ramen. The noodles were soft and just perfect. The broth was flavorful. If you get the extra spicy paste make sure you do not put the whole thing in there. Try a Little first so you can gauge the spiciness level that suits you. At first when the bowl came out, I thought that there wasn't enough broth but after eating it I find that it's the perfect amount. And the best part is they offer more noodles if you like.   Overall very satisfied and will be back.",

    "text": "We got Curry ramen, the flash fried wings, and a hirata bun (this was excellent and one is not enough !) They were all very tasty. For the curry Ramen, it's more of a sauce rather than a soup unlike most of the ramen dishes come. We recommend another one if you want a more soupy ramen (would be good for a winter lunch or dinner). You can also add additional toppings to your ramen like an egg, sprouts, corn, etc and of course pork belly which was the most ordered. Sit at the bar bc you can watch the amazing assembly line of chefs doing flash freezes to charring of the pork belly and ladling of the steamy noodles. Just the smell of this tiny resto made us want to go back before we tried our food. This place gets crowded for good reason so go there on a week day but if you love the excitement of the chaos, go on Sunday afternoon!",

It's not mind blowing.  Ordered the tonkotsu ramen for the first time in a long time.  Noodles were fine, perhaps juuuuust a little overcooked.  The egg was also soft-boiled, just turning into overcooked.  Plenty of garlic oil and the rich broth made the difference.  my only complaint from this trip that mirrored my last - the pork was overcooked, charred on one side.  A little off-putting.  But all in all, still a well composed bowl of ramen.",

    "text": "Came here basically on a whim.  It's not up to Las Vegas ramen standards but seems like maybe one of the better joints in the Phoenix metro.  I may return sometime and give them another try.  But my first impression is that this is Americanized ramen and doesn't match any authentic ramen style that I am aware of.  But I could be wrong.  Not to come across as a racist jerk, but I did notice that there was nothing but very young white employees in the kitchen and as servers, and there are no Japanese entry/exit greetings.  Since I'm not a Phoenix resident, maybe this is not unusual here.  I got the spicy miso ramen with added karaage.  100% not spicy, not even 'white people spicy'.  Broth is a little weirdly sweet, as others have mentioned, which may just be because of what tasted like sweet pickled bamboo shoots (so weird).  There was also sushi-style red ginger in wide slices.  Normally miso is put into the house pork, chicken, or combo broth, but it honestly tasted like the miso was just mixed into water.  This made the broth oddly too thick and too thin on flavor at the same time.  The broth was not at all hot enough.  I did see that you could select \"extra rich\" broth but I wasn't really sure what that meant (are they watering the broth down if you don't get this??  make extra fatty? be more clear) and for my first visit, decided to try the broth as-is.  I prefer a little more fatty and meaty broth.  The fresh noodles tasted good, but they both looked and tasted exactly like fresh spaghetti noodles, they didn't seem alkaline, springy/bouncy at all.  Karaage was okay.  I personally did like the slightly blackened BBQ-style charsiu but I could see why others might prefer the traditional style.  The egg is pretty good, semi-soft.  The prices are totally fair and the service was pretty good.  I feel like this place could be vastly more improved with a better and more authentic broth recipe.  The potential is there.",

You can see the machine and the ramen knots placed carefully in racks **the employees and cooks are friendly and everything is out in the open. There are no secrets; in fact, you can sit in the booth area facing the cooks so you can see them making all these delicious creations as you enjoy your ramen. **the topping are fresh and plentyful, I love their black fugus and the employees work hard to keep up with the demand ***they have a list full of other toppings that you can add (for a fee), I have NEVER seen this many options with others.  Beware: this place is SUPER small but the flavors can't be beat. If you have ever wandered about this please come to this place first. I promise you will not be disappointed.",

My friends ordered the regular miso ramen. Their broths I tasted were pretty mild, plain an unexciting. My broth however turned out slighly better hint of spice with pork belly. The spicy miso had warming flavors, we were sad that they ran out of hirata buns to try. It would be nice if they had more appetizers. All in all it was decent for $10 but unmemorable.",

So if you're looking to escape the sun, this place isn't it. The food isn't pleasent to look at but surprisingly flavorful. And well done. The squid was very surprising being cooked right. Most times I've had squid it's been over cooked and like chewing rubber. They use bandanas as a substitute for Hachimaki, a type of Japanese headband. It doesn't pull it off very well. But it was nice to hear the traditional greeting when I entered. The seating arrangement feels a bit crowded.

Paying $1 for a marinated egg is so worth it to go with your ramen. The meat is also a great addition to their delicious broth. The reason I didn't give 5 stars was because their restaurant desperately needs an upgrade! They have several small tables that seat 2, and then one giant table in the center with stools where they place everyone else, so you'll most likely be sitting right next to someone you didn't come with and there might be a wait depending what time you come. Nevertheless, I come for the food and at the very least you can take the noodles togo and get a similar amazing experience!",

    "text": "Been waiting some time to offer up a review of Tampopo, the first serious effort of Japanese Ramen in the metro area. It's seem the very day they opened Ramen joints suddenly started sprouting up all over the valley.  Having tried most, no other's are worth noting except for Niskikawa 'neighborhood style' in Chandler,  a truly unique bowl for serious Ramenites.   Walking into Tompopo you really get that feel of a fast-paced Tokyo Ramen joint ... love it or hate it ... there's no middle ground. Eat your noodles and get out kind of place, but not soup Nazi, think fast friendly service. While the uninitiated may at first feel insecure, sit down and persevere, this is a must try culinary experience!  For novices I recommend ordering the basic bowl as there's already a lot going-on-in-there. The $1-3 add-on toppings tend to complicate the already well balanced flavor. Also don't forget the must have side order of Yaki Goyza. A glass of Asahi draft beer from Japan rounds out the experience.   Obviously I'm a regular at Tompopo, but I'm also their toughest critic as I travel regularly to Japan. While their overall consistency has improved, disappointingly their Ramen has not, nor has their menu expanded as I hoped.  Still frozen at 3.5 stars.  Tough love aside,  Tompopo is an excellent introduction to Japanese style Ramen ... and my go to place for a quick fix in the Valley of the Sun.  Get yourself a bowl ...",

    "text": "We were eager to try out the new ramen place. Apparently many others were curious about it, too, because it was crowded for lunch at 2:00 on a weekday.  Highlights: The \"hard boiled egg\" was perfectly soft-boiled. The noodles and broth were OK. (Sorry, that's the end of the highlights.)  Disappointments:  - It's a small, cramped and awkward to walk through.  - Service was very, very slow. They really need to work on that.  - I had the tonkatsu with shrimp. The shrimp arrived intact, including eyeballs. I had to dissect them with my fingers and a napkin. Finally achieving that, I found them to be overcooked and rubbery.  - What is with the slab of pork in a dish to be eaten with chopsticks? Sorry, but it's just a pain. If it was tender, one could pick it up with the chopsticks and bite it, but it was also overcooked and tough. Like with the shrimp - I like soup that's actually ready to eat.   - Also, what's up with the wooden soup spoons? Looks like a ladle, and you have to hold the handle above your head to sip the teaspoon that it actually holds. Really.  Not recommended. Not going back.",

    "text": "Was super excited to try this place after finding out they make their own noodles with their super fancy machine thing but had a similar experience to many other Yelper's.  We came on a Friday night at the hungry hour (7 PM) and were able to get in no problem.  The place is small, has some single tables, but is mostly family style long shared tables or shared space at the kitchen bar.  We sat at the kitchen bar which got a little cramped once more people arrived.  We sampled the Gyoza and each got Tonkatsu ramen.  The Boy got the spicy noodles and I opted for the rich/concentrated broth, I also added corn and pork belly.  Everything, while well done and delicious, just didn't work together.  My broth was good, but not amazing.  The portions were just ok as well, one small slice of pork in my dish and the upgrade to add corn for $2 was super tiny.  I didn't get whole lot for the up charges to add items to the Ramen.  Not all was bad though, The Boy loved the seasoned egg and the pork belly was good.  I do recommend adding Roasted Pork vs Pork belly.  The roasted pork was amazing, a little on the fatty side, but had a lot of great flavor.  Another plus, the peanut oil has been removed from the dishes making it a safe for those with allergies to partake.  Now can we talk about the weird spoon?  I am all about flare and authenticity but it was so awkward to use.  I am a small girl and the thing was the size of my arm.  Couple that with the cramped space of the shared table, it was just difficult to use.",

    "text": "To start off this place has only been open for about a month. The layout is very much like a traditional ramen shop in that its pretty small and has lots of bar seating. They don't take reservations and the place is pretty small so its not great for large groups.  I read reviews on Yelp before going so I expected the service to be kinda iffy. When we first walked in on a Saturday night we weren't greeted by anyone so we just stood around for awhile. There were empty seats but other people were waiting by the door too. We had a group of 10 and the waiter was quite exasperated by that when we told him. We were split up into 3 groups but eventually seated ourselves together at the bar. The service is incredibly disorganized. They have 3 people serving the entire restaurant which since its so small should be enough. For some reason they were super ovewhelmed and kept messing up our orders and forgetting things. We had to grab our own menus and napkins and didn't receive water until the food arrived. To their credit the servers were very nice and very apologetic about the wait and all the messups.   Onto the food...we ordered a couple Harata buns, takoyaki, and variety of ramen. The Harata buns are pretty much a piece of pure pork fat inside a wilted piece of lettuce inside a bun covered with spicy mayo sauce. I would definitely not recommend them. The takoyaki was decent but nothing special. The ramen noodles were actually pretty good. Definitely better than the other ramen places around here like Dozo and Cherryblossom. The broth however was disappointing. I got the rich broth add-on and found that it was weaker and watery compared to the normal broths at the ramen places in California. I tried the regular tonkatsu broth which was even more watery so I was glad I chose the rich broth. The broths were salty but not very rich. I liked that you have the option for extra noodles and extra toppings because the other ramen places around here don't offer that.   Overall I think I would come back to try this place again but not anytime soon. I'll probably wait a couple months or a year until they teach their servers how to be more efficient or hire more and maybe make adjustments to the broth. For now I'll probably stick to Dozo Izakaya to get my ramen fix.",

Ramen is one of my favorite foods for over 20 years(and Tonkotsu ramen used to be my favorite ramen), so I have had ramen at many many places, including Hakata Fukuoka where Tonkotsu ramen originally comes from.  While I admit that it might be great if the broth of Tonkotsu ramen here had more flavor, I think that ramens at Tampopo are decent and authentic.  Before I found this place, my \"go-to\" ramen shops in Phoenix/Scottsdale were East Wind and Cherry Blossom. Champon at East Wind and Cherry Blossom is good and I will probably still go there, but Tampopo comes first.  I wish they had more tables for a group of four people.",

Service was pretty good for being what seemed to be understaffed for the amount of customers they had. We tried the gyoza, spicy and regular miso ramens. Hubs really liked that you could get noodle refills for $1.50! Spicy was not spicy at all  but the server made it seem like the extra hot would ignite my face on fire.... I wish I would have went there! The broth was pretty good and the gyoza was good but the filling was not very hot. So here's where I start to compare to Republic Ramen that is just a couple miles away. RR is hands down better. (Even with the noodle refill option.) I also enjoy that at RR you choose you broth, protein, and fillers to customize your personal bowl. I haven't found a ramen house anywhere else that does it that way.  Overall it was a good experience and we'd do it again if RR was closed or something.",

    "text": "The ultra spicy ramen with regular noodles, add kakune. Words can not describe how good this ramen is. I'm honestly convinced they put crack in it. The kakune literally melts in your mouth. As someone who has eaten here at least once a week for several months, I feel I can offer some honest criticism. There has never been a bad meal, but there is a definite difference in the broth depending on the day/chef. It ranges from thick/hearty and amazing, to thinner and amazing. I personally like the thicker consistency, but it is always on point taste-wise. On to the egg. Sometimes it is a bit overcooked (no liquid yolk), sometimes it is absolutely perfect. The slice of pork is pretty good, tastes better to me when it gets a bit of extra char when they heat it over the open flame on the stove. The noodles are bomb, especially when they are a little al dente (they are never overcooked in my experience). I always do the regular noodles instead of the spicy out of personal preference. Both are great. On to the broth. I've tried all but the seafood and curry.   #1 Ultra spicy is NOT that spicy. Don't be afraid of it. It is spicy enough to clear the sinuses and maybe cause a tear or two. No lingering \"burn\" in the mouth. It's by far and away my favorite.   #2 Spicy Miso. This one needs a bit more spice in my opinion, but whatever. It is rich and ginger-y. Honestly if the ultra spicy and spicy miso had a baby, it might be the best ramen ever  #3 Tonkatsu. This broth is really hearty, but I like spicy, so in my opinion it needs to be dressed up with soy/chile oil/seasoning. Everyone I have taken here that is too chicken to try the ultra has really liked it.  #4 Soymilk miso. It's so-so. Not BAD, but not my personal taste.  As for the appetisers. The hirata buns are pretty good, and the goyoza is good. Honestly if you can manage to eat an appetizer AND a gigantic bowl of ramen, hats off to you. If you came here looking for something other than ramen, move along and save your crappy review and space in this tiny place. Their apps aren't going to blow you away because it is A RAMEN RESTAURANT.  TLDR: Ultra spicy, add kakune! Price is great and you will leave full. Best ramen in Phoenix, hands down!",

    "text": "First off I will say it was OK.  Maybe my expectations were too high.  I have spent a considerable amount of time in Fukuoka and love Hakata Ramen. So when I heard about Tampopo I was very excited and had no problem driving across town to give it a try.  I actually had the opportunity to try three different types Tonkotsu, spicy miso and their ultra spicy.  The soup is relatively weak.  Hakata ramen is Pork based rich with flavor, but theirs needed more flavor.  There is an option to order the \"rich\" soup, so don't expect it to be flavorful with the basic (I didn't try the rich).  Additionally I was expecting benishoga (pickled ginger) and takana (pickled mustard greens). An other topping that needed help was the char siu (roast pork).  the pork was cut too thick and was extremely fatty.  The little bit of meat was tasty though.  I was not a fan of their ultra spicy ramen.  The spice level was right, but they mixed spices with the noodles making them pink.  I think it would be better with standard noodle in the spicy soup.  The spicy soup made up for the lack of flavor.  Service was lacking, but understandable since it is a new restaurant.  Because of this my rating just refers to the food.  When we arrived we were greeted by three different people and asked if we were ready in the first 5 min.  That was the highlight of the service.  The waitress brought the wrong order.  I don't believe in wasting food so I told her it was alright and started eating.  Fifteen minutes later another lady brought the correct order.  When we finally finished our meal it was 20 minutes before we got the check.    I will probably wait a while before giving Tampopo another try.",

It seems that if you have it good in one place you always expect it to be just the same at other places. At Tatsu the sweet corn actually tasted sweet whose flavor really \"popped\" AND you got lots of it.  This was not the case at Tampopo.  At Tampopo, you can see right in front of you the sweet corn being cooked and it looks fresh. However, it didn't have a fresh crispy bite to it nor was it memorably sweet.  The saving grace was the ramen's thick zesty broth and perfectly cooked noodles, two delicious pork slices, and a near-perfectly boiled egg. Bravo.   What was missing was fresh pressed garlic as a topping.  Again, I'm comparing it to Tatsu Ramen where I was able to press the garlic myself and in an amount of my choosing.",

They make noodles fresh everyday, and once you try them you will settle for nothing else. Tampopo sets the standards high. All of the employees were friendly and hospitable, the ramen was extremely affordable for the quality of food you will receive. To put it another way, you pay ten dollars for some of the best food you will eat in Phoenix. You need to go here. The noodles have changed my life for better. I have ascended to a higher plane, and look down from the clouds with sympathy at those who have not eaten those noodles.

    "text": "So here's the skinny on Tampopo: the noodles are great. Hard to beat noodles made on premise, they're very proud of that, as the first sight you see besides the crowd is the room to the right where the ramen is made. It's a thin ramen, holds against the teeth very nicely, not too soft, not too firm. The spicy miso broth was good enough to finish the bowl, enough veggies to provide a nice texture and flavor landscape against the roasted notes of the chashu and in my case, the cubes of buta kakuni -- pork belly slow braised in shoyu and dashi -- that I got extra. There are a lot of options to add to ramen. There was even an option to kaedama, add a second helping of noodles -- but we were pretty full. The praise we've lavished on the noodles isn't shared with the starters which showed up after the noodles did: the takoyaki, sadly, were fresh out of fridge cold, and the tebasaki, while ginormous, were essentially fried naked wings, splashed sparingly with sweet shoyu and a few black sesame seeds. These were both fails. But we'll be back for the noodles.",

The pros about this place are the noodles are very good and fresh and are prepared in house as demonstrated by the little room where you can see they are made. The cons however is the tonakatsu soup is fairly weak and not rich as it should be, they do however have a weird option though for adding additional flavor to the broth for an extra $1 which is ridiculous in my opinion. The chashu I also found to be a bit tough and about 75% fat.  Overall the best in Arizona but that is not saying a lot so if you go in with low expectations you will enjoy it. I give the owners props however for trying and hope they improve on what they have.",

The service was exceptional, atmosphere was clean and pleasant. I wish they had Shoyu Ramen on the menu, but settled for the Tonkatsu Ramen and wasn't disappointed. I can't give it 5-stars because I like Monta's Ramen in Las Vegas better and they didn't have Shoyu Ramen on the menu, but I will be back since it is by far the best in Phoenix so far.",

We got to sit at the bar, and even though it was pretty packed (a rainy day makes for a good bowl of ramen) we didn't feel neglected, or crowded by the other like minded individuals who need a bowl of that soul-warming stuff.  From the broth, to the noodles, to the chasu... just yum!  Oh and we asked for a side of the pork belly, oh sweet baby Jesus!! The. It's delicious thing ever tasted.

They made the most of the space they were given but the set up was all wrong. On to the food, so we ordered the tonkastsu ramen which is what we always order when going to a Ramen place. Here it was ok. The Meat wasn't as tender as we are used to and the broth was lacking that saltiness and the soup spoon didn't seem like a soup spoon at all but a wooden flat utensil that has no purpose. I'll just have to wait for another place to attempt to do Ramen that is worth a 40min drive.",

I always get the broth with more flavor. I've only tried the Tonkatsu ramen so far, I can't seem to stray away! I still have a hard time deciding if I want to go to Cherry Blossom or Dozo Izakaya for ramen, but tampopo is much closer to me and I love all their other foods!",

Prices are really reasonable to not need a happy hour! You'll easily spend 20 dollars and under for one person or maybe even 2. You pay for quality and of course you get quantity too! Bowls have 4-5 choices and of course you can add your own ingredients for less than 3-1 dollar more! Bowls are huge for one person! So bring an appetite! I've been here twice so far and loving it every time . I wanna try everything's. Service is wonderful and just an good ambience inside! But the only downfall is it gets packed cause it's mainly set up for one or 2 people per party so if you have 4 or more it might be a wait but that's it. I'd say it's worth the wait!",

I was unhappy about going here, but went for him. However after I took my first bite of the Hirata Buns appetizer I quickly realized how VERY VERY wrong I was! It was packed full of flavor.. Seriously tasty. I must have said how good it was every other bite.   I ordered the spicy miso ramen with the extra $1 for the \"rich soup\".  I took a bite and I couldn't believe the amazing flavorful goodness.  It took a few minutes to figure out how to eat the ramen with the chopsticks and the sauce with the big wooden spoon. (Had I known my lack of skills I would have wore a black shirt, I had spicy ramen splatter all over me) My egg was cooked to a perfect gooey perfection. I got everything that came with it and only added the rich sauce.   My hubby didn't get the rich soup and preferred it, however myself and my daughter added the rich soup and I MUCH preferred it!!!! It really packs the flavor in. I tried all 3 of ours and the spicy was the best! It is not very spicy at all so don't let that deter you! The Hirata Buns are a MUST.   The staff was very friendly and chatted a bit as we are at the bar. We had a lovely visit.   Negatives: None.",

I'm a big buy and this space is very small as it is but on top of that they cram so many tables in here its nearly impossible to walk through the isles with out having to turn side ways and bump into people sitting down. Or be bumped into while your eating. The place only had like 7 guests but still felt to full. They should take out the middle row and do something else. I sat down and was greated by one person who I asked some questions to then didn't see them again and someone else 5 min later asked me for my order. Which is a bit long for something like this . I then ordered 3 times meat... Cus I could see they did not put much in their ramen. I made it very clear I wanted a lot. What I got was 5 medium at best dry pieces of pork . the broth was okay . they do offer more noodles if you want which is cool but none of their ingredients were all that tasty . under seasoned and texture wise seemed like they sit out and just add them to the broth rather then cook stuff fresh . or they just over cook stuff. The bill came and I for sure got charged for 3 times meat ... Not sure how 5 peices is three times . but was way to expensive . horrible experience here.",

    "text": "God... I've been such a hater of this place (see last mediocre review below). Like such a hater. Anyone who even mentions Tampopo in my presence and you could hear my scoff from a mile away. BUT recently I went back and I am SO happy to be proven wrong! Their tonkotsu ramen is so much better than I remembered! I also got it with the rich broth this time, which I didn't remember them having last time, because I definitely would have added it on!  My boyfriend got the ultra spicy ramen and I didn't think it was as good as the tonkotsu. Their chili paste made the broth too thick to really sip on and it was super salty. I think you're better off ordering a regular ramen and adding chili oil if you are craving something spicy. We also got the gyoza and kaarage. The yuzu salt with kaarage was a nice touch but didn't really add anything imo. I'd rather eat fried chicken with ketchup",

    "text": "This is one of the best, if not the best, ramen places in Tempe. It is located in a quiet plaza on the corner of McClintock and Southern. There is ample parking for the restaurant. Upon going inside, you will see that is quite small and could probably fit about 20-30 people comfortably, so don't come with a large party. There is a large table in the center with smaller tables on the sides. There is also bar seating if you are eating alone or with one other person. The ramen comes out pretty quickly as they always have the broth ready. I always order the rich tonkotsu ramen as it is my favorite. I try to always include an extra side of chashu. The flavor of the broth is amazing as it is rich and flavorful. Alongside the broth, the noodles has a great texture with a little bite into which I like. The chashu is tender and has a nice sweet and smoky flavor. Overall, this is a great ramen shop with a good atmosphere and amazing ramen.",

    "text": "This may be 4 stars, but this is the best Ramen place in Arizona/Phoenix. It's a small and hip little joint. The servers were really nice but they didn't check up on us a lot.  As for the food, I ordered the ultra spicy and my sister had the Tonkotsu. The broths were just fabulous although the ultra spicy is really just medium. I added more chili oil though which was awesome. The noodles are also delicious as well as all the other fixins.   The reason why I give this four stars and not 5 is because my Ramen came with one piece of pork. To add another would have been $3 and the pork is not that good. They also didn't let me sub pork belly for the roasted pork which sucked because I love Ramen places that are very accommodating to your taste. The egg also lacked flavor and was not runny at all which is a major bummer. Overall, for being $10 for the ultra spicy and $8 for the Tonkotsu, it's not a bad place to go, and considering the broth is the best I've had in Arizona, I will be back.",

    "text": "Let me start by saying I am not your typical ramen lover. I grew up eating instant ramen and when I realized there were restaurants serving authentic ramen, I decided to give it a try. Out of all the places I've been to, Tampopo Ramen is the best one I've had in AZ! They made me become a ramen lover. The first time I came I got the seafood ramen and absolutely loved it. Today I tried the ultra spicy ramen and it was good as well but I do prefer the seafood ramen more because of its broth. If you are one who can handle your spice, you'll agree with me that the ultra spicy ramen does have a kick to it but it's not \"ultra spicy\". I feel like I got more spice from adding in their spice paste called \"Bakudan\" to my seafood ramen when I first visited. Also, it was hard for me to enjoy the ultra ramen broth because it was more dense, which is something I do not prefer. Nonetheless, the ramen was still tasty and I still think this is one of the best places to get ramen. I love how their ingredients are freshly made and how their seating environment resembles an authentic Japan experience!  PS- Do not wear a white shirt while eating the ultra spicy ramen, especially if you're a messy eater like me!",

I got the spicy ramen with two slices of pork and a hard boiled egg.  It was definitely spicy in a reddish thick broth.  It was OK.  One guy got the Curry Ramen and didn't like it--said it had no flavor.  One lady ordered the octopus balls as an appetizer.  While the presentation was pretty, they were a gooey mess inside.

    "text": "I want to write a quick disclaimer saying that at time of writing I've got a stuffed nose so that might've effected me a little bit.  Anyhow, went here with my foodie partner in crime after hearing other ramen fans rave about this place. Needless to say my expectations were very high.   I grabbed the Tonkatsu ramen and added fried chicken and white onion to it while my buddy got the miso ramen.  This Tonkatsu is probably the mildest I've had so far. I feel there was a certain hardiness missing from it. That being said, this wasn't a terrible thing. There's been ramen in the past that was too dang salty and I had to guzzle water just to eat it.  My hang up comes up after getting to try a spoonful of the miso broth and realizing how much more flavor that bowl had. Either this cold is throwing me off, or I chose poorly.   Moving on from broth we had a lovely slice of roasted pork belly, black fungus, bean sprouts, scallions, and the egg in addition to the added fried chicken and white onions. The pork belly was my favorite part and I wished you got more than 1 slice. It was tasty. Same goes with the added fried chicken. The 3 pieces were satisfying and flavorful. The other toppings in this bowl seemed very well-rounded. Heck I usually pass on anything fungus but these black fungus strips were good. The egg wasn't my favorite thing, but then again, I don't eat hard or soft boiled eggs. Food buddy enjoyed her egg so if you enjoy soft boiled eggs you'll probably enjoy the ones here as well.   Honorable mention goes to the noodles here! Their consistency and texture are way different than the squiggly noodles found at other places. They really seem fresh and not like they've been sitting in a plastic bag for a while.   Serving sizes here are just about perfect. The bowl you get is so cute and the toppings aren't drowning in the broth. Ratio of broth to stuff just seems correct.   Overall rating and impression: satisfied but not excited. Definitely going to return in the future when I'm 100% healthy and give it another go.",

The presentation of all the dishes are really nice, but I was not a fan of my teriyaki chicken over rice at all. It was a nice portion size for 5$, but not all that appetizing.   As for the service, the staff is nice but since the place is so busy, that they never answer the phone. My friend thought he may have left his credit card there after we left the restaurant. So we called and got put on hold forever and then got hung up on ughh. I imagine it'd be hard to do takeout because they don't tend to answer their phones.

    "text": "Recommended: yeah good flavor and fast service Food: Food overall it's good.  Service: Service is average. The food comes out pretty quick.  Cons: the restaurant is pretty small. You maybe sitting next to other people like if you were in a bar but a bit more cramped all around.   Details: This place has some good ramen. I normally order Tonkotsu at Japanese ramen places. Although the ramen are decently pretty good but it's not my personal favorite. This place has the white ramen noodles but I normally prefer the yellow noodles for my Tonkotsu ramen. They serve their ramen with very little amount of broth but flavorful still. Since their broth is very concentrated for the flavor, they only put barely enough of broth to cover the ramen noodles. And then place the other ingredients on top so you could see the presentation of them. They also service their Tonkotsu ramen with a hard boil egg. I believe this is close to the traditional way but I had place where their egg is poached instead which it is creamier texture added to the ramen. Of course it depended on personal preference.    Cons: I normally don't come here often since this restaurant is pretty small. They have about three rows. One row has table tops, one middle section row that you would most likely sit next to a random person while sitting across from ur friend/family. It's a very condense place and it's only enough for one person to walk between the rows. And last row is similar to sitting at a bar where ur facing the kitchen and cooks. I think because of this reason, a lot of people don't come often or order to go.",

    "text": "I had pretty much given up hope of finding a decent ramen place in the United States, but Tampopo Ramen appeared to save the day!  The pork belly appetizer tastes amazing. Really fatty and melts in your mouth. Ugh, SOOO GOOD.  The cucumber and sesame oil dish is okay.. I probably should have added more salt or something. It was a little too oily but bland.  The spicy ramen tasted amazing! It would have been nice to be able to customize the softness of the noodles, but hey, we are in not in Japan so whatever.  Note that the tonkatsu ramen uses peanut oil. My sister is allergic to nuts, so it's a good thing that the ingredients are listed!  The service is great!! I had the creamy melon soda thing, which I didn't really love, but it was interesting to try. It was like a fruity cream soda basically.  I would definitely return. It's pretty good and more authentic than most ramen places in the US that I have tried.",

However, there was a perfect table in the back for 4 and we're seated immediately!   The service was spot on! Staff was friendly and quick with our orders, drinks, and food! We ordered the pork belly bun to start, along with the agedashi tofu, and the squid balls! The pork bun could have used some more ingredients, I love when restaurants put something pickled or some type of veggie in their bun. It would be nice if they added more bun options as well, was a little disappointed their was only one option. The agedashi tofu however was outstanding! Perfectly crisped on the outside, soft and flavorful on the inside. Mouth is watering right now just writing about it!   Now let's talk ramen. Love that they make their own noodles in house. That was the main reason we came here! They definitely give you a plentiful amount of noodles! You have the option to have original or spicy noodles which you don't see at too many other ramen houses. We all had the spicy ramen, half our table with spicy noodles, other half with original. The pork belly was delicious, I also added fried chicken, bamboo shoots, and seaweed into mine. My egg was cooked perfectly, soft boiled with more of a wet yolk, however my girlfriends yolk was overdone. Do wish there was a little more broth, the noodles seemed to take over the bowl.   Overall 4/5 stars I would definitely come back to get a ramen fix in! Would like to try their tonkotsu next time :)",

Hopefully, they will become successful enough to move to a more spacious location.",

Being Japanese I have grown up around several authentic and yummy ramen places around me in Hawaii and was so bummed I was not going to find a place with the same experience when I made my move to the desert. To my surprise, I found this gem right by my house and have fit this restaurant into my restaurant routine.   Every visit I have had here I have not been disappointed in the service. Being that this restaurant has a smaller/more intimate setting the service compliments it perfectly. My favorite spot to eat at is at the ramen bar being that you can actually see the chefs create your dish for you using their signature broths and handmade noodles.   My favorite dish that I have tried is the Miso Ramen. Every dish is customizable and you are able to add/subtract any of the toppings that they carry which can be great for vegetarians or dietary restrictions. I have also tried the Ultra Spicy Ramen which I definitely recommend if you want to add a kick to your day!  Overall, I cannot say enough great things about this place and really is a little taste of home every time I visit. I hope you enjoy it too!",

    "text": "I love all types of ramen. That said, I have to give praise where praise is due. Tampopo's handmade noodles are on point. My family and I came here with a friend from out of town. We were seated quickly and given our menus (pro tip: come early, it is small and fills fast). My eyes were INSTANTLY drawn to the Ultra Spicy Ramen as I am a sucker for scorching foods. My wife, daughter and friend went with the more normal tonkotsu and seafood ramen respectively.   The food came quickly and my wife's soup was amazing. It had rich pork flavor and plenty of noodles. It was, however, a little light on actual pork. My friend loved his seafood ramen as well (I couldn't try as I am very allergic to shellfish). Even my 2 year old daughter devoured her portion of my wife's bowl.  My ramen, however, was a disappointment. Yes, it was spicy (not as much as they proclaim in my opinion) and yes it has the fixings. My issue was the flavor and texture of the broth. It had almost no flavor, just burn. I've eaten numerous items which are delicious but also a ring burner. This wasn't like that at all. The texture of the broth isn't like a nice soup like the other broths nor is it thick but delectable like a stew (or even hot and sour soup from a Chinese restaurant). Oh no, it had the texture of mud. This thick, brown and red, mud. It was very, very unappetizing. It didn't work with the comically large spoon you are given nor the chopsticks (the broth makes it nearly impossible to grasp the noodles). I was able to make my way through the noodles but will not be having it again.   Tampopo gets 4 stars as everyone else's food was amazing and I'll come back for a normal bowl of ramen soon. But man, I can't recommend the ultra spicy ramen to anyone. Blech.",

I love bringing friends and family here so they can taste the goodness that is Tampopo's handmade noodles and savory broths. And that melt-in-your-mouth buttery pork?! Deeelish.   My go to order is the Miso Ramen, add mushrooms and add extra pork. I truly believe extra pork is the key here... I cannot get enough! I really love their hard-boiled eggs, which tend to be more on the soft-boiled side. That runny deep yellow egg yolk is so good! My boyfriend likes spicy food so he usually orders the Ultra Spicy Ramen, and adds extra pork per my suggestion of course. He loves the level of spice, but has admitted that it can be overpowering and can take away from the actual flavor of the ramen. For those who like spicy but don't LOVE it, he suggests the regular spicy ramen, not ultra spicy.   Tampopo Ramen is a small restaurant with some communal seating, but I've never waited longer than 10 minutes for a spot to slurp down some noodles. You can sit at the bar and watch the chefs hard at work, but be warned that it's a lot warmer up near the kitchen. I made the mistake of sitting there in July and I couldn't stop sweating. But, I also couldn't stop myself from eating a huge bowl of steaming ramen even though it was 115* outside.",

I ordered an egg for $2 extra because I like the egg in ramen more than the pork sometimes.  Both the tonkotsu and spicy mison ramen broths and noodles were tasty. I wish all the bowls were \"rich soup\" instead of having to pay an extra dollar. But maybe that's alright since some people don't care about the boniness/fattiness of their broth and it would be wasted.  At the starting price for $8.00 without any add-ons for a bowl of ramen, I feel the price is reasonable and would encourage repeat customers. Cute place and fun atmosphere.",

The chairs are so close together, we had to keep our elbows in as we slurped on our noodles.   The noodles are made in house and was absolutely delicious. The consistency and texture was spot on. The broth wasn't overly salted which was big relief.   We tried three different ramens. The tonkatsu was my favorite in terms of broth and toppings. The soft boiled egg was seasoned well and was very satisfying. Consider ordering extra for added protein.   The spicy miso had korean gochujang flavor mixed in with miso. It was funky for me but my son seemed to enjoy it. The ultra spicy ramen comes with spicy broth as well as spice infused noodles making this dish extra spicy. However, the broth (I should say 'sauce' because it was really thick) had again gochujang and tobasco flavor which was really strange combo and didn't taste right. Hubby didn't care for this dish either. Again, tonkatsu ramen was very good.   The takoyaki was delicious but it was on super soft/mushy side. It was seasoned well too.   Overall, the cramped seatings took away from the experience. I would go back for the food.",

    "text": "Tampopo Ramen is THE bomb. Best tasting ramen I've had in the valley. Every time I visit, my tastebuds AND wallet leave happy.  The prices at Tampopo are fantastic. $11 Ramen, $6 rice bowls, and a full stomach?? Heck yeah. My fiance and I usually share a ramen bowl and a rice bowl and still can't finish everything.   The miso ramen is so tasty and I can never get enough of the broth. I always order the same thing and never get tired of it.  The fried chicken here is also perfectly cooked and crispy and pairs really well with the rice and sesame seaweed on top. I usually get the braised pork rice bowl which is also very amazing. The braised pork is so tender and just melts in your mouth. Yum   Whenever you're craving comfort food, Tampopo is the place to go. It gets pretty busy at times which means seating can get pretty cozy since there's only bar seating, a long communal table and maybe 5 small side tables that can only fit 2 people.",

I love that this place understands that spicy/hot should not come at the expense of flavor. I lieder the ultra spicy all the time, but it is not just hear. There is an actual increase in bold, standout flavor as well. Adding pork and wild mushrooms or shrimp is always nice,  and these additions are not skimped on.   For lunch or happy hour,  this place is fun and relaxed. For happy hour there are some nice deals on some interesting appetizers. Once again, even these are Ali about nice, robust flavor.

    "text": "I have mixed feelings about this place. I came here with a friend from out of town who happens to be a vegetarian. We sat at the bar and enjoyed fairly good service (our food did sit in the window for a bit, and I was tempted to just go grab it, but I refrained). I was excited to try this place, as my go to ramen establishment just closed to relocate (umami) and I am currently ramenless. I ordered the super extra spicy ramen and my friend had the only vegetarian option which was a soy milk based ramen. The workers were nice enough to put his pork on the side so I could eat it. Anyway, the ramen came out and was a bit small for the price (9-10$). Each dish only came with one piece of pork that was mostly fat. The parts of the pork that were not fat did taste good. The ramen was served with giant odd wooden spoons that were difficult to eat with due to the cup portion being mostly flat. The flavor of my ramen was good, spicy, but not too spicy. The noodles also were tasty, and I appreciate that they are made in house. The best part of the ramen was the egg.... it was just slightly soft in the middle and added a lot of flavor to the soup. My friend's vegetarian ramen was not so good. It tasted a bit like alfredo sauce and really nothing like ramen. It had some peppers in it that were still very crunchy and didn't taste like they had been in the soup at all. This was pretty disappointing. Anyway, I would suggest that this restaurant look into making a soy based broth that mimics traditional ramen as an option for vegetarians. Additionally, I feel that their prices should be lower OR they should fill the bowl and maybe give (gasp) two slices of pork.... it just wasn't enough to justify the price. I may give this establishment another shot and hopefully it will get better as time goes on.",

My sister and I came in and ordered three appetizers: agadashi tofu, japanese chicken wings, and gyoza. We asked our waitress if the gyoza is hand made or store bought and she had the audacity to lie in front of my face saying its hand made. I tried it and it is the most common purchased gyoza at your local lee lee oriental super market. My god.. Each of the appetizers were 7$ and the portion is ridiculous as well as the taste. The chicken wing tasted like its been put into the fryer and someone dripped some soy sauce on it. The tofu is not a normal agadashi tofu size and it taste bland and under fried. The worst part was the ramen... I got the signature tonkatsu ramen and double meat. Thats my biggest mistake of the night. I always taste the broth first as it is the indicator to how good the ramen will be. And it taste like aged water... The noodle was alright and the pork tasted like burnt shit. I would highly not recommend this place. The only time i can see someone giving this place more than a 2 star is when that person had poverty standards. Oh.. Im giving this place a 1 star because even the service was terrible. Never a refill or taken any of the appetizer plates away. Good luck",

The presentation was decent and I saw the master chef put his huge bone marrow into the broth to my delight.  The problems came with mostly services.  She has very little idea when to clear the table and kept on asking me am I done (twice) which I feel like she wants to confiscate my soup.  The right way to ask is If I am still working on it instead.  The soup was underseasoned broth so I had to enhance with Japanese chili oil, spices, and caviar.  The agedashi tofu broth is improper (light soy sauce expected instead of eel soy sauce)..Tacoyaki is great but with too much dry fish which covered the flavors of octopus balls.  I will have to go back for others and evaluate others and see if I will return.  My status with this place is still pending..",

But even though this place lacks space, they know how to prepare yummy ramen!  Most Ramen-ya in Japan is crowded without chairs because people are on the go.  Tampopo tries to keep the traditional ramen-ya without the Western frills.  So don't even think about hanging out with friends to talk and catch up at the dinner table, please go elsewhere.    My first bowl was the tonkatsu ramen.  The broth was rich with a lot of depth.  The noodles was just the right texture and chew.  Customers are able to see that the noodles are fresh as you walk in.  To complement my meal we had takoyaki and wasabi tako.  They were both really, really delicious.    My next bowl was the ultra spicy ramen.  The hot factor was just as good as my love for Korean spicy food.  It was a cold evening, so my ramen was the perfect cure.  This place won over my husband's appetite.  He got extra pork and egg for his ramen.  The kids for once didn't complain and they enjoyed the takoyaki with the generous amount of bonito flakes.",

The broth was indeed rich and flavorful and the noodles were very fresh with a chewy texture. The pork was well seasoned and went well with the ramen.  Service was good and I was checked up on as needed. Note that there is no soda fountain so soda is by the can or bottle (Coke products and Ramune).

    "text": "New ramen restaurant in Phoenix! I saw one of yelper's checkin a few days ago and couldn't wait to try here for myself.  Grand opening was Monday 11/2, so still new here. Looking at menu, I thought they really researched Phoenix market by adding several spicy options  I was in search of authentic Hakata ramen, so I stayed with basic Hakata ramen with my noodle al-dente, just like True Hakata style.  Ramen came with kikurage (can't remember English name) but dark seaweed looking one on the picture I posted. Very authentic. Soft boiled egg was warm and flavorful.   Unfortunately they put too much black paper on my soup and couldn't really enjoy the broth. I add black pepper only to Sapparo ramen. Hakata ramen goes well with sesame.   I also ordered side of gyoza. Gyoza tasted very authentic, and I enjoyed them well.  Service was not there yet. Considering they just opened, I thought it wasn't fair to say anything yet.  Next time when I come back, I will ask them not to add any black pepper in my soup, and pay small extra to add more flavor to my soup. Let's see how that gets close to what I am used to eat every time I visit Fukuoka.",

    "text": "First time at Tampopo tonight.  I tried the spicy miso to-go, which was very good.  I wish there had been a bit more meat in it, but the flavor was good and I was very pleased with my choice.  I tried the buns as a side, which had a good taste but I wish again had a little more meat.    I am giving a five star rating because the service was very good.  The food was probably worthy of a 4-star rating but I was very pleased with the help of the girl at the counter.  The restaurant was PACKED, I was shocked how busy it was on a Thursday night.  The girl who took my order was kind enough to bring my food out to me in my car so that I could stay in the car with my kids.  Very kind of her to do when the restaurant was so busy!  The fresh noodles were great, will be going back!  UPDATE: Went back for a second try with my daughter.  Service again was excellent and the restaurant wasn't as crazy busy at lunchtime.  Had the ultra spicy and added shrimp.  I certainly wouldn't say that it was ultra spicy but it was still delicious.    I know everyone posts about those octopus balls... I didn't really care for them.  Potstickers were very fresh and delicious!  My daughter loved the fried chicken and rice.",

    "text": "After reading the rave reviews, I was super stoked to try this new ramen place. I got the tori karrage, the Japanese fried chicken, as an appetizer. The chicken was overcooked, rendering the outside to be hard, and inside meat to be dry and chewy - I wasn't very impressed.   As for the ramen, my boyfriend and I both got the tonkotsu ramen, adding the rich soup for an additional $1. Honestly, the broth was overly salty and not flavorful/rich. It makes me curious to know how the regular broth would have been since we requested the rich soup (aka concentrated and flavored) and it wasn't banging rich. I was also bummed out that the egg was hard boiled instead of the soft boiled egg with runny yolk inside; the egg was overly done for me. I watched the chef blow torch the pork, and was disappointed when the pork turned out to be super chewy.  There is an option to add other toppings to the ramen, which we did not try. Overall, the ramen was pretty generic to me. This is comparing the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbomb.com&s=bb4f996415a9c2f21137e27cfb68f439a48cec2652b53e9b50dd7e766dbe177e\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">bomb.com</a> ramen in NorCal, such as Ramen Dojo and Orenchi.   The service was fantastic though. The waiters were very attentive and efficient at what they were doing. They really tried hard to make a good impression. Excellent service - it's just the ramen was satisfactory, nothing unique. However, a good alternative if you're craving for some ramen in AZ.",

I've ordered the Tonkotsu ramen plenty of times here; upgrading the soup base to rich broth is a good option, otherwise the soup is just so-so. The noodles are indeed made in-house and they aren't phenomenal, but it is cool to see that you are eating homemade noodles.  I have ordered the curry rice here once, and it tastes the exact same as the same Japanese curry rice I make at home using store-bought curry packets. I really am focusing on the ramen though, thus rating a 4/5.  Service is standard, friendly staff, etc. . Seating is kinda wonky but I'm here for the food.",

For paying extra for rich soup, the broth was bland and was lacking a hearty thickness that I was expecting. I've had better creamier, thicker broths at other ramen places without having to pay extra for \"rich\" broth. The noodles were disappointing. They were more like soba noodles than ramen noodles, which are for dipping. The noodles didn't soak up the broth well. Also the noodle and broth ratio was not adequate. There was barely any broth. So when I reboiled the noodles in the broth, the noodles kept sticky to the bottom of the pot. I had to continually stir deeply and scrape the pot to avoid the noodles from sticking. The rice bowls tasted good, but it was expensive for the small portions. The rice and meat get stuffed into a small togo container.",

Easily down a bowl.  list of extras to add on is on the expensive side.  They do have the $2 for more noodle option. kae-dama  I wish they had a ultra spicy miso version.   Would come back if I wanted to alternate between my ramen places from time to time.",

    "text": "After doing an advance booking for an upcoming trip to the Philippines via Japan. My wife decided that she was in the mood for some ramen.  So, I chose a Ramen shop that would best represent the \"closeness\" of a typical Japanese ramen shop that she would be experiencing when we visit Japan. This place is diminutive compared to the other Ramen shops in town.  It was a plus that this place also serves Hakata-style and Tonkotsu Ramen. It lent to the authenticity of the experience, albeit, thousands of miles away.  The make their noodles fresh at this place. And it shows in both the texture and flavor.  We ordered the Gyoza for starters. Nothing too special here. It was just average. Now my Ramen was amazing. Even with the minimal toppings, it still quite flavorful. Not too spicy, but just right.  However, my wife's Fried Chicken over Rice dish was about as plain as they come. It really could've used more seasoning.   The service was not that sprightly, either. It took time to get the attention of our waitress, who seemed overwhelmed by the crowd who were packed in like sardines in this place.  If you are in the mood for some great Ramen, this is the place. Just don't get the Friend Chicken. And hopefully, you don't have a vast personal space requirement!",

    "text": "Swung by on a Saturday at 1pm, and it wasn't too crowded. I ordered the spicy miso ramen with wood ear. Food came pretty quickly, but it was missing wood ear so I assumed they had just forgotten.  The noodles were pretty good, firm and had body. The broth was pretty good at first sip, but I didn't find myself dying to have more of it. The flavor was more salty than rich, but I could definitely taste the miso in there. The other toppings were alright - the pickled ginger added another depth of spice, but nothing else really stood out. Also, I didn't realize it only came with only one slice of pork (because the menu says \"slices of roast pork\")? Not to be nit-picky because the pork was good, just disappointed there was just one slice and the menu said otherwise.  When I got the check, it had +$1 for extra bean sprouts - I told the waitress I thought they had just forgotten the wood ear mushrooms, so she ended up just taking it off completely. I probably should have said something when they bowl came, but I didn't think much of it since the food was already in front of me (and I didn't want them to take it back because I was hungry!).  I haven't been to other ramen places in the area so I can't compare in that sense, but the ramen itself was pretty okay, floating at the 3 out of 5 stars range.",

    "text": "This is probably one of the best if not the best ramen in the state. I'm a sucker for hole in the wall mom and pop shops and this fits the bill. Located on the corner of McClintock and Southern, it's easy to find but sometimes parking can be difficult. The store is sandwiched in between a Starbucks and a few other stores so spaces are limited.  In the dozens of times I've come here, I've never seen it empty. If you go at night you might want to plan on a little bit of a wait. For the most part, the people that dine here look to be the young college crowd. It's pretty quiet and everyone is very respectful. Being a smaller restaurant, it has such a cozy feel.   I basically get the same thing every visit- spicy miso ramen add rich. The rich is a condensed broth option that adds so much depth to the soup. I feel as though sometimes when getting spicy dishes, flavor can be sacrificed for heat but this is not the case here. With the broth, you get an incredibly deep, rich and creamy flavor with just a little kick. If you want more spice, they do make spicy noodles which are a really neat red color. The list of extras you can add is pretty extensive. I love that you can watch the chefs prepare all the food while you wait so there is no question that everything is made to order and fresh.   If you come here, you will not leave disappointed! Just the bowl of ramen itself will fill you up.",

With that being said this place is great, the flavor of the broth is delicious especially if your flavor profile can handle a little bit of spicy. The ingredients are fresh for sure the only thing I did not care for and I know I will catch some flack for stating this, but I do not like the full shrimp with the eyes still attached just sayin. Other than that this place will not disappoint and is worth a shot.",

We tried basically the whole menu, it was just ok. Nothing great about the broth, the noodles were ok. The braised pork was horrible, extra fatty, extra thick, and I couldn't even cut the meat it was so chewy. The charsiu was not bad, probably the best meat we tasted. The extra spicy broth should be labeled medium spicy. The spicy broth should be labeled normal. The curry was very flavorful but the noodles were so sticky, it was hard to eat. The pork bao for $4 was a waste. The bao itself tasted like it had been frozen and heated up. It was pretty gross for $4 each especially. The takoyaki was good, even though we didn't see it on the menu, we just asked for it. Overall it was ok, probably won't be going back anytime soon.",

The dumplings were slightly dry, but just the right amount of stuffing inside. The octopus balls were surprisingly incredible. My only drawback would be to have the sauce on the side, instead of drizzled all over.   Now, the ramen itself was very savory. I went with the concentrated version of the miso ramen. I went more traditional and was pleasantly surprised with the broth itself. I added the shrimp in, which I just wish I had added a little more meat.   While I didn't order the spicy ramen myself, I did try it and was delighted by the flavors. It had a slight kick, but with the noodles, simply perfect!   There were a few drawbacks to be expected. The egg broke up way too quickly. The atmosphere was busy and fun and the seating was pretty limited, but it certainly did add to the overall atmosphere. Overall though, a wonderful meal to enjoy and have great conversations over.",

I really wish they had sesame oil as well. The slice of pork belly in the bowl is ON POINT! The portion size is huge, as per usual with ramen, so wear your stretchy pants. One thing that keeps me from going when i really want a delicious bowl of ramen is the rough seating arrangement and HORRIBLE plastic high top ikea bar stools. They are tiny and slippery and it'snot a comfortable way to devour your piping hot ramen. I hope they expand to a bigger location and get some better furniture. My boyfriend often gets the miso with spicy noodles. this might be crazy, but I like to add his miso to my tonkotsu or steal some of his spicy noodles. I think those small difference make a big difference in overall taste. Service is great, though wait staff is usually sparse...so you may have to wait or they may forget your beer. You can't fit any more employees in this place! This place is far better than Republic (sorry!), so give it a try. I'll say it again - stretchy pants.",

    "text": "I LOVE ramen. And I LOVE the movie Tampopo. So maybe I had really high expectations for this place...  This place just does not do it for me. I really appreciate the open kitchen and home-made noodles, and I think it is great that they have even altered the noodle with a spicy version if you so choose...but the broth is just not my favorite. And the broth is critical to a good bowl of ramen!  I like a simple, clear broth which is tasty; this is not an option at Tampopo. The closest is the Tonkotsu - which in my opinion is too opaque and bland for my taste. I have had bowls of ramen at other restaurants (and home-made) which had much more clarity and much more flavor. It was necessary to add the hot pepper seasoning and a little soy sauce to give the broth more depth. Some people really enjoy a fatty piece of meat and while the pork was tasty, there was a tad too much fat for me. The toppings were fine, but my goodness how could NARUTO not be an option for an addition at this restaurant?!? If you have seen Tampopo, you would know that this is a traditional topping to ramen. Just look up Tampopo Ramen Master scene or check out this link in YouTube - <a href=\"/redir?url=https%3A%2F%2Fyoutu.be%2F6WrkdTrrwew&s=2089470c8ee1f7d202840391823b86cd9d5774a85440ed9e058e76326ddc5978\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">youtu.be/6WrkdTrrwew</a>. This is how a bowl of ramen should be made, and eaten. I understand that being in AZ we cannot always expect the same traditional Japanese ingredients in our food; however, this a frozen item than can be obtained at a local Asian market. It baffles me.  The appetizers are good, especially the Hirata buns, pork belly, and takoyaki. There are more interesting ones that I want to try, but I am just not sure I will visit this place again because I do not like the soup. Tampopo is really close to my neck of the woods so this is quite saddening to me!",

Atmosphere is pretty solid, however seating is a bit tight, especially when busy. Ordered the Takoyaki and the Miso Ramen from the menu. Their broth is pretty solid, reminding me of flavors I got from Little Tokyo whenever I make my trip out to California, clean broth, tasty but not too potent. The Takoyaki was on point, the seasoning and sauce tasted perfect and they give a good portion of octopus in it as well. Overall I really enjoyed this place and as of now, this is probably the best ramen shop in the east valley, beating out Umami and Republic Ramen. While it isn't a Little Tokyo ramen shop, this will do just fine to get your fix.",

My little brother thought It wasn't spicy but he good with it. I would recommend this restaurant for anybody who want a taste of Japanese ramen.",

The second time i ordered the pork belly, it was just a little more firm, not as melty - but still fantastically delicious. It comes in a tiny bowl with rice and crab salad but is more than filling.

The takoyaki here is pretty good. Aside from that, service is getting better since they have opened. While I love the cozy atmosphere, it gets a bit annoying when (not to be racist) foreign exchange students come in and dine since they are loud and don't know any table manners.(I seriously cringed  when this guy next to me slurped and made noises due to the spicy ramen.

And the melt in your mouth pork belly. Only qualm was the pork buns I decided to try- too much sauce (as others have noted). The portions are quite generous, especially the edamame appetizer.

We were both happy with our food.  It was really busy, every seat was taken at dinner time. There were a ton of employees but as far as I could tell there were only two servers and one girl who was seating and filling water glasses. Our server forgot about us for long periods of time.  He was probably stretched too thin and he didn't have time to check on us. We sat for at least 10 minutes trying to flag him down in order to order more noodles. By the time we received our noodles, our soup was cold.  The restaurant is small space. It seems to be popular for young patrons. I don't consider myself old but I am pretty sure I was one of the oldest in there last night.  I'm looking forward to trying more ramen shops around town. I don't really have much to compare tampopo too, but we did enjoy the food. I'm sure we will be back.",

Yes, I was aware of this place thanks to Yelp! (thanks, Yelp), and I did intend to visit so maybe it's just a happy accident. We had the spicy miso ramen and the tonkatsu ramen, both were excellent. Now, after reading some of the reviews, I concur that the spicy miso ramen is not very spicy at all - others seem to have had this experience too. Good news - there is a caddy of soy sauce, spicy chili oil, and a shaker of spicy hot seasoning at every table. Also, I have to mention the neat gizmo with a crank on it at every table: a sesame seed grinder/shaker that works almost like a pepper grinder except with sesame seeds. Genius! I was so hungry I forgot to take a pic beforehand...but I certainly captured the aftermath. Very cool wooden spoons with the soup. Four stars because it felt like forever to get the food, but it was delicious, and I want to return to try a few of the other items. Otherwise, the place was clean, the staff was friendly and knowledgeable, the vibe was upbeat and they were doing brisk business which is always a good sign.",

There was a little bit of a wait time for a table which was understandable as I went on a weekend. Their service could be improved however as I felt the wait staff was just running around and they never checked on me until I was done with my meal. I ordered the Tonkatsu Ramen which must have taken at least 20-25 minutes to arrive. While their noodles are very good being hand-spun noodles everything else was average at best. They use a hard boiled egg for their ramen soup whereas other ramen restaurants use a soft boiled egg which I prefer. The pork was extremely chewy, so much so that I couldn't even get myself to finish it. As for the broth it was flavorless and I had to even bring myself to use soy sauce. One positive is that their broth is not very salty which I suppose some people would prefer that instead.  I've had ramen in both LA/SF areas and while it would be unfair for me to compare the ramen here to the ramen shops in California I feel that there could be improvements made to their ramen soup here.",

I have tried both the tonkotsu ramen and the miso ramen, while my boyfriend has tried their ultra spicy ramen. Their miso ramen has a lot more depth of flavor to it compared to their tonkotsu broth, and my boyfriend said that their ultra spicy is LEGIT (and this is the kind of person who can eat ghost peppers). Their braised pork belly is also an excellent addition to ramen, but I've yet to try it donburi style with rice. Extra toppings add up so just be mindful of that when ordering.",

I got the tonkotsu and my dining partner had the spicy ramen.  He said he liked his better than the other place, but we both agreed that the tonkotsu had no flavor whatsoever.  The noodles were good, but I hate it when restaurants give you a huge chunk of fatty meat with no way to eat it without looking like a caveman.  Also, the seats are pretty uncomfortable.  We'll give it another shot, but I am definitely going to try a different dish with (hopefully) more flavor.",

I found it easier to eat with the spoon of you bring it vertically up to your mouth instead of tilting the spoon. also, the service was good and bad. one of the waiter service was good while the other one not so much. as I was eating he just walked by and toss my check on the table, which was rude to me. he didn't seem like he was having a bad day since I can hear him carrying a conversation and joking with the table behind me.",

How did they find out later? The other time they almost served my foods on the table and took it away, saying oops,it was not mine. And they greet you when you come in but not when you leave.

    "text": "I lived in Tokyo for over 3 years and consumed all sorts of noodles almost everyday from little side street, quick serve ramen shops to full menu, full service restaurants.  I found Tampopo a decent pretender that serves Americanized food.  The Tonkotsu Ramen was unremarkable.  The noodles almost had the correct texture, but were too chewy. The egg was poached correctly and the pork was over-salted in lieu of the correct seasoning., The rest of the ingredients were so-so.  The broth did not help as it had none of the depth it should.  The Miso Ramen was a near cousin to the Tonkotsu and was also unremarkable.  The broth had none of the richness it should have.  Avoid the Green Tea. It barely had any hint of the burnt rice or green tea flavorings tea should.  It is a watered down, Westernized version that is probably devoid of any healthful Catechins and digestive benefits.  Be advised that it too has been further Americanized because, at $2 a cup, that does not include any refills.  If you are looking for real Asian Ramen Noodles, go elsewhere.  Based on my two visits, this place has cut too many corners Westernizing its flavors to maximize its profits,  When little, quick serve Ramen shops can get it \"right\" everyday, Tampopo is too Westernized for me.  If Westernized commercialized bland ramen is good enough for you, then you'll be happy with Tampopo.  In my opinion, if you want authentic ramen done right with the right depth, richness-sweetness (not sugary, if you really know your Asian foods) and the flavorings it should have, then this is not the place.",

I has hoping this was the ramen that would change my minds about all ramen but sadly it did not.   The only appetizer worth ordering is the takoyaki. That was actually very delicious ... others were very disappointing to say the least.  Appetizer:  - chicken wing was so meatless and tasteless (nothing like the picture )  - pork bao was huge and the meat was non-existent with a ton of sauce and a pathetic piece of iceburg lettuce that was fell outside the bun, rushed much? - pickles were basically cucumber and carrots with a hint of vinegar  For the ramen itself, it came with a piece of pork that is very tough, not the melt in your mouth kind that makes you want more. I ordered the spicy miso but felt no spice at all. The egg however was perfectly cooked. Also, it would have been nice if they added a little bit more broth,  because I'm a soupy kind of gal, mine felt a bit lackluster.   I guess I'll still be searching for a ramen that will change it all but definitely not from this restaurant.",

Scream and shout, turn and try Tampopo Now you gotta go to Tampopo  Keeping it real, this is probably the closet solid Ramen joint in town for now!  I came here on a cold winter day.  The place is somewhat tiny so don't be surprised, but what I love about it is the bar top tables as you watch the chef cook and make your meal.  The community table is always a plus in my book!  I went for the Tonkotsu Ramen with some fish roe and a side of Octopus and Wasabi.  I also ordered a bottle of sake; cause what's Japanese food without sake!?  Overall, the octopus was what I'd expected it to be.  Slimy and with a bubbly pop and a hint of stinging wasabi.  The star of the night had to be the hand made Ramen noodles with the chewy and fatty pork, while the mushroom and egg helped mellow out the strong broth.  The roe I added helped gave it a salty taste.    In the end, Tampopo Ramen has won my heart as the next hot spot for Ramen!  Until the next challenger comes along, guess you can catch me at Tampopo! - Enjoy!",

    "text": "There is a reason why I drive from the west valley to Tampopo for ramen. One bowl of ramen from this place fills my soul.   The Good: -Ramen is why you come here. Home-made noodles and be sure to add kakuni to your ramen (Stellar!) I'm a tonkotsu type of guy so I always get either the original or ultra-spicy tonkotsu ramen. -If you dont want ramen then the teriyaki chicken bowl is a good choice. -Appetizers I normally get that are really good are the gyoza, hirata buns, and shisito peppers.  Bottom line; for me this is the best ramen shop in the valley. I have been to a lot of really good ones but there is a reason i keep coming back. If you haven't tried Tampopo yet what are you waiting for?? (I mean it....go now!)",

I stared off with the Hirata bun which I was excited to try but it was a total fail. The bun was way to big for the amount of pork that was in it and I didn't like the piece of iceberg lettuce that was inside the bun.  Then I ordered the Spicy Ramen. It definitely looks more spicier then it tastes. For paying $10 it would have been nice if I got more then 1 piece of meat in my ramen. It was all noodles, 1 egg and 1 meat. I didn't care to much for the noodles either. I give this place 2 stars because our server was attentive and nice.",

    "text": "This is a small authentic Ramen shop, it's super  small and the main seating is a long narrow strip of table with a bunch of stools around it. Everyone is sitting next to or across from one another in a pretty small space. Luckily we got one of the few tables, it happened to be empty when we showed up. They have one vegan/vegetarian option and I do not recommend it. The only option they have is ramen noodles in soy milk broth. The soy milk tasted kind of burnt and it was like cereal and warm milk...except it was ramen. This may be more authentic but I did not like the ramen at all. Chalk it off to me having set expectations or not keeping and open mind but soy milk and ramen did not taste good together to me. When I asked if they had any other veg options the server was very frank. No. My friend who ordered non veg ramen thought it was mediocre compared to other ramen spots in Phoenix. Though her reaction wasn't quite as bad as mine, she wasn't all that impressed. My partner disliked the dish so much that he ate a couple bites and left the rest. This is someone who usually leaves no food behind and never has leftovers. This was the first time I saw him straight up not eat his food and he's told me a couple of times, \"that was the worst meal I had in 2017.\" I didn't want to waste food and the noodles themselves tasted pretty good. I pulled the noodles out of the soy milk onto a bowl and added soy sauce to mask whatever burnt tasting soy milk was left and ate the noodles. Not optimum but much better than the original. Will not be coming back here, they do not have veggie broth ramen. if you are vegetarian/vegan your only option here is soy milk broth. My brother who is non veg and loves ramen says this is the best ramen he's had in Arizona so they must be pretty good, I didn't like the vegan option I had and don't recommend for veg people.",

I came with some friends instead of coming alone this time and the service was quite a bit speedier than the first time I came so I'm willing to forgive the slight waits I had the first time even more. We got the kara age as an appetizer which was very nicely cooked but if I were to make one suggestion it would be to include some Japanese mayo or at least some kind of sauce to dip the chicken in. The salt was good but a little plain. My friends loved their tonkotsu and spicy miso bowls and I got myself another seafood ramen (the taste of shrimp with these noodles is just too good) and we look forward to coming back in the future.",

I typically get my ramen fix in New York and California (the most recent was a place in SF) so I went into the restaurant with some hope but realistic expectations.   My sister and I came here on a weekday around 2pm, and it was empty. This worked in our favor as we got seated and served right away. Though, I've heard from others that they've had to wait a bit even after the typical lunch rush.   We got the takoyaki to start, and it was better than the ramen in my opinion. I got the classic tonkatsu, and my sister got the ultra spicy ramen. The tonkatsu was alright. It wasn't as flavorful as others I have had, and the egg was hard boiled. That's disappointing because I like soft boiled eggs generally. My sister got the ultra spicy ramen, and she said it wasn't as spicy as the server made it out to be or looked.  Overall, it's alright... I gave it a 3 star ultimately since I wanted to be fair and not compare this place to the ramen of New York and/or California.",

I ordered everything she did (Tonkotsu ramen and gyoza), because I was in ramen training.  In an unexpected turn of events, the ramen arrived before the appetizer, but that didnt stop me from wolfing down all 6 yaki gyoja once they hit the tabletop.  The ramen was a delight, with a delicious pork belly surrounded by things, a floaty egg and my first love: noodles.  The egg was cooked perfect, with a runny yolk.  This day was extra special, because that's when I found out about kae dama... which is Korean for \"Bring me extra noodles, please\".  I dont know, maybe its Japanese.  Anyway, an extra order of noodles is only $1.50, but it takes a frickin long time, so if you think you want some, order some once they set the ramen on your table.  During my return visit, the yolk was cooked too long, but the service was UNPARALLELED!!!  George, my waiter, was outstanding.  He essentially fawned over me, explaining the process, and showing me the fancy high tech noodle making machine from Korea.  This kid has a bright future in whatever he sets his mind to, because he has a winner's attitude!",

    "text": "I had to try it out cuz you know... it says ramen expert on my profile. From Japan to California to Tempe, I am here to see who makes good ramen! I was super excited about this ramen place because everything looked like a ramen place in California. Just from the pictures I have seen, it looked more authentic than all of the ramen places in Arizona... including Fujiya Market.  I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen without the extra flavor. The broth was not as thick or creamy as I expected. That is really the only reason why it didn't get 5 stars (and the fact that the waitress forgot my order... twice). It was the criteria that would have matched it with the awesome ramen shops in California and Japan. Next, it was trying it with the extra flavor that costs an extra dollar. And to my disappointment, it didn't really had any depth to it. It just tasted like it had more sodium in the broth. Although, I do recommend the extra flavor because the regular flavor was kind of weak since it's missing the flavor from the creamy and thick texture and the pork fat that's supposed to be floating on top of a tonkatsu broth.  No doubt, the ramen is still better than Umami and the forsaken place called Ramen Republic. I think Posh in Scottsdale is a little better but it's way more expensive. So I think Tampopo is a good compromise on flavor vs price with the available options here in AZ.  On a final note, THE TAKOYAKI IS AWESOME! Tastes good, authentic and full of actual octopus. Just like the ones in Japan and California. I was pleasantly surprised. It beats the ones being served at the Japanese Matsuri that were more expensive and had octopus \"paste\" in it.  I just might come here for the takoyaki instead of the ramen. Tampopo... your takoyaki destination. LOL",

I read her review and it was awesome, but read some others that were negative and just thought those people were being annoying...  It truly is a cute little hole in the wall. There isn't a ton of room and it seems like a cool mom and pop place where you feel good spending your money. The thing is...the food just isn't that good! It sucks because I was so excited about the machine that makes the noodles and based on the good reviews I was so excited! We had the gyoza and the pork belly to start. Both were ok...nothing special...we ate them...and then shared the spicy ramen. The noodles looked, felt and tasted just like regular pasta to me...and the broth was ok... not as much flavor as I have had before or even made at home.   It just was either missing something or just not that special. The service was ok - nothing special just like the food. Its such a bummer to give not as good reviews - I kind of hate it really. I wanted so badly for this place to rock and be able to take friends and go more regularly, but it didn't do it for me. Unless someone I know goes again and tells me its the most amazing thing and they've changed and the flavors and food and service are the most amazing thing ever and I am an idiot for missing out, I probably won't go back here.",

Broth a lil on the  bland side in my opinion but works good with combination of green onions, soft boiled egg and mushroom. If you like meat order extra Chasu (Grilled pork). IT SO YUMMY MAKES ME WANT SOME RIGHT NOW. - One of the best place to get Kakuni (Braised Pork Ribs) - If you are a fan of Japanese food or culture, you can also get Tako (\"octopus ball\") here to try and selection of Japanese beers.   Cons: - I think they need to hire more server especially for their busier hours. There are time I had to wait for longer than acceptable for sevice. - The chair isnt the most comfortable thing to sit but I'll  live.",

So, of course, I had to cash in here once my ramen craving struck & it did not disappoint! Holy crap! I'm in tastebud heaven! I don't know what they do to that rind of pork they roast and add to the original ramen, but it is the <a href=\"/redir?url=http%3A%2F%2FBOMB.com&s=ac71b33d32e90570e9c0d70edf9b4cac5f20e98e10501794c62801370f5dd3f7\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">BOMB.com</a>! (& I am not normally a pork fan). & the gyoza, deeelish! Pan-seared & super fresh! & their curry rivals any authentic Indian curry restaurant all day long.  This stuff is sooooo good, soul-satisfying, tasty, delicious, authentic food! I'm so happy about the food I can't think of more creative adjectives beyond authentic and delicious! Just go! It won't disappoint. You'd nearly miss it tucked in between a Starbucks and great clips, but don't!  It's so worth it! I carried out, but the whole ginormous bowl and ladle for a spoon experience looked like something worth going back for to dine in! Excited to find this place! & hope people like you continue to go to make that possible! Truly a gem! Thanks, B.! I'll be back!",

    "text": "Maybe to others I would be considered an inexperienced ramen eater. I've never enjoyed ramen in Japan, California, or New York. But I don't think that really matters. What matters when you go out to eat is... 1, did you enjoy your food? 2, did anyone working at the place do something to intentionally piss you off? And 3, did it cost more than it was worth?  For Tampopo Ramen, I answer those questions thusly: 1, yes, very. 2, no, everyone was courteous and friendly. And 3, no, I felt I paid a fair price for my meal.  Some of the reviews written about this place raise a lot of questions in my brain. What are these people like? Are they hard to please? Rude? Or are they reasonable people who experienced a bad side of the business I wasn't exposed to?   I don't have answers to those questions, only speculations. And ultimately, that doesn't matter. My advice is don't let those bad reviews influence your decision to come here. I can honestly say I enjoyed the food and that none of the staff was rude or inattentive.   Anyway, with that off my chest...  I've ordered the tonkotsu ramen, no add-ons, and the ramen curry. Both were very good, but I enjoyed the tonkotsu more. To me, the flavor of the broth was just right. I also loved the taste and texture of the fresh noodles, and I thought the egg was cooked to perfection (somewhere inbetween soft and hard boiled). I don't understand the complaints with this dish, I thought it was excellent. To me, the ramen from Republic Ramen and Cherryblossom pales in comparison.   I look forward to coming back and trying all the different varieties here.",

    "text": "Finally, a True authentic Japanese-style ramen house in the valley. I have long been waiting for someone to  open a restaurant like this. I still wonder why it took so long to do so. If you read the Yelp reviews so far, it is obvious there is a huge demand for ramen.  We had a group of 11 dined on Saturday at 6:30PM.  I'm glad I made a reservation. I figured the restaurant would be tiny as most ramen restaurants are.  They have a long table in the middle of the restaurant to accommodation large groups, a few 2-4 seat tables, and seating around the open kitchen similar to your sushi bar.  Apparently, we were the first large group they had since opened.  When we first arrived, the waiters came by quickly and gave us water and just 4 menus. They either were short on menus or the just can't count. It was difficult to get their attention after that. I knew from there on it was going to be a really long night. We ended up sharing the menus.    We ordered the apps and main entrees at the same time. Later, the waiter came back stating they were out of regular ramen and only have the spicy ones left. Ok, a few of us changed to rice bowls and a few wanted to try the spicy. I ordered the curry chicken with spicy ramen. Oh, the noodle was spicy but bearable. I wouldn't recommend for the kiddos or anyone that can't handle the heat. My dish must have been sitting on the counter for a while. Lukewarm curry don't really mix. Although the noodle was spicy, it still tasted fresh and good chewy texture. The curry tasted bland, but the spicy noodle sort of balanced in the curry. Hint hint.  Noodles and dumplings all made from scratch and in-house by a special machine. It's serious business here, a room just to showcase that special machine and probably watch them making the noodles. They even have one of my favorite street snacks, takoyaki (octopus balls)!    After 30 minutes, one side of our group already finished their dishes while the other side was still waiting the food and apps. We noticed the people after we ordered all got their food, ate, and left.  The Waiter kept telling us the kitchen was behind. After another 15 minutes gone by, we all finally got our food except for one.   I understand there always kinks with brand new restaurants. The Owner came out a couple of times to apologize for the mistakes and even offered us drinks. He indicated when the Waiter changed our order the ticket was pushed back towards the end. The kitchen and front staff were so overwhelmed with orders which just not prepared for that night. After we all paid and was hanging out in the front of the restaurant, the Waiter rushed out stating one of the credit cards was charged with another customer's bill. Huh?   After a week or so, all my friends who charged under their credit cards noticed a refund on their statements.  Apparently, the Owner must have reversed all the charges for that night. He didn't have to do that. No doubt, he is genuine in the Japanese values. This certainly will be my go-to place when I crave for ramen!",

When we were clearly done with the meal no one came over for several minutes.   The taste of the ramen was very good and that is why this place gets 3 stars! I just wish the service was better!",

The dashi stock component was somewhat lacking, so the broth came out somewhat flat in terms of aroma.  The egg was slightly overcooked, and the marinade didnt penetrate the egg well enough.  The ramen noodles was spot on.  The tonkatsu pork was on point. I loved how there was more fat in the meat than most places, ao it didn't taste dry like most places. Would I come back?  Yes, but I'll probably order something else.  The food wasn't too bad, but it just needs some improvement",

It has pork, pickled ginger, pickled bamboo shoots, bean sprouts, scallions and a half boiled egg (probably my favorite part). The broth is AMAZING and has such great flavor. It's mild enough that even those who don't normally eat spicy food can still enjoy it and if you want it spicier they will be happy to make it spicier! I've had grilled octopus there which was super delicious and their gyoza which deserves to be hyped up more! It's fair priced for how great it is and how authentic the noodles are. I always get my spicy miso with kakuni. Kakuni is pork belly and it basically melts in your mouth with an amazing savory sweet flavor. 10/10 I will always be here when I need my ramen fix!",

I tried several items: the Soymilk Ramen, the Tonkotsu Ramen, and the Agedashi Tofu. I had a hard time finishing the Soymilk Ramen which is unlike me. The broth was a bit rich, but overall the taste of it was smothered by the green and red peppers. Other parts of the taste were coming from the bean sprouts and scallions. These vegetables weren't cooked into the broth, but topped off with it, and that's pretty much all I tasted. There is an undertone of a milky sweetish taste to the broth that provided the richness. I thought I would enjoy the broth from the Tonkotsu ramen more, but again it tasted like a watered-down vegetable soup rather than a traditional pork-based soup. I liked the decor and design of the restaurant. The service and presentation of the food was excellent, but I left a bit disappointed.",

If you watch them as they're cooking, they roll their eyes as customers come in (I think because they don't want any more customers or they're too busy or they hate their job) and have a huge attitude problem. They mumble stuff under their breath and absolutely don't want to be there. Not sure if the management is bad to them or if it's just them having a bad day but this has happened 3 out of my last 5 visits. I'm a big believer of making food with LOVE and passion and these kids (most of them are college kids) don't understand that.. Haven't been back for 3 months so I'm hoping they changed their attitude.",

    "text": "This is as close to legitimate Japanese ramen as it gets in the Phoenix metro.  However that is not saying much, it is just saying how terrible our other options are at places like Republic Ramen, Umami, Dozo Izawaya, and Sushi Ken.  I give the food 4 stars but I took one star off for the terrible service.  I will get into that in a bit.  I ordered the Tonkatsu ramen with added heavier soup flavoring ($1 more) and also added bamboo shoots ($2 more).  Visually the bowl of noodles look the part with typical toppings of sliced green scallions, wood ear mushrooms, and bean sprouts.  The soup stock is pretty good with plenty of flavor, the self-made noodles were cooked al dente with nice texture, and the half-cooked egg had good creamy and gooey texture.  The char-su pork slice, however, was horrendous.  They are suppose to almost fall apart in your chop-sticks while you pick them up and melt in your mouth.  I should not be trying to tear off a bite with my mouth as if I am trying to tear apart a piece of steak.  Now onto the service.  My wife, daughter and I were there on a Friday night with good a good amount of crowd, however the place wasn't packed out the door that you typically see at good ramen places in Los Angeles.  After we were seated it took us a good 15 minutes before we just gave up and grab the menu ourselves.  After we determined what we want to order we closed the menus showing that we were ready to order.  However it took us another good 20 minutes after witnessing another larger party, that came in later than us, getting their orders taken right away before I had to yell at the waitress if we can please get our orders taken. We were never checked ok how we are doing or whether or not my daughter's empty water cup needed a refill.  Also I should never have to get up and walk across the restaurant just to grab a napkin to wipe my face.  Needless to say I left a sub-par tip.",

His suggestion (since I like spicy) was the spicy miso ramen bowl which had the most tender pork, bean sprouts, green onion, delicious ginger, and I believe bamboo.   Their ramen hit the spot!! The noodles were a fantastic texture & not over dons, absolutely perfect for my preference. While it was probably enough to share, I devoured the all of it on my own.

The price is good, you can get a ramen and some toppings under $12.   Appetizers: takowasa and takoyaki are my favorites. Something very special, really compliments your ramen.   Ramen: Decent broth, it's nothing too crazy. Noodles are good. I usually get the miso ramen, but I find it that there's too little broth. Don't add too many toppings, it might overwhelm the taste a little.   Service: Good. They always seem a little too busy for the small place it is, I think they could relax a little.   I would give the place five stars but what's lacking is the mood. The workers all seem a little too depressed and the place is a little hot. But that's almost all ramen shops. Hopefully they can lighten the mood a bit. Regardless, I will definitely be back!",

We were really hoping, from reading all the wonderful reviews, that this would be the place.   The menu is full and has all the things you might want to get: agedashi tofu, takoyaki, soyu ramen, tonkatsu, and more. Presentation is great too, but the composition of the ramen was just not there. Even before taking my first bite, I knew that the ramen was over cooked - the noodles were heavy and well soaked with water and broth. Albeit, when I went to slurp the noodles, they were soft and lacked the nimble, light texture.   My boyfriend got the ultra spicy ramen, the extra spicy tonkotsu broth, which sounds amazing, minus that this bowl was a goop of oil. The ramen was spicy, as named, but I think only because the broth was drowned in chili oil.",

    "text": "Not bad ramen place in Tempe!   We came here on a whim and the place was absolutely packed! It looks like a small \"mom & pop\" shop that is totally brought to life with all the people that fill up the place!  The menu is pretty easy to follow. Most people stick with the regular Tonkotsu ramen and add things to it if they want to make it more special.  Do the $1 extra for the rich broth, you can definitely tell the difference.   We also shared some squid ball appetizers before getting our ramen. They taste alright. Kinda reminds me of eating a stuffing ball with a little bit of mayo and hoisin sauce on it. I wouldn't get it again if I came back.   The broth of the ramen, even when I got rich one was still so-so. I've actually tasted better broths compared to having pho or beef noodle soup, or Tom yum goong. The noodles were fresh, but it wasn't I was expecting. Maybe it's because I'm just used to eating ramen out of a packet, but the texture reminded me more of spaghetti.  The boiled egg in there was awesome though! The fried chicken add on that I got was not good and not worth $3.  I also got the roe because it was recommended on the menu, I didn't really taste it to be honest.   I feel bad for leaving a so-so review, but it's my honest opinion. Maybe I just don't like going out to eat ramen, and I always thought of it as a cheap food that you make special cause you make it your own at home.",

It comes out hard boiled with the yolk cooked all the way through. I wish they could get the runny yolk right as it would really make the difference here.

My family and I arrived mid afternoon which was nice given we were able to get seated immediately which I have read is not always the case. The joint as many have mentioned is on the small side but staff seemed to work the problem well and get people in and out swiftly. Staff were very outgoing and answered many of our dumb questions with a smile.   For the starter, we all tried out the hirata buns. The little guys were very yummy and the sauce really carried the dish. As for the entree, I went with tonkotsu ramen with the added topping of mentaiko. The broth was flavorful and all components flowed well together. The egg was just perfect with the dish and wish I would have added an extra. My wife and daughter loved their ramen as well and preferred rich sauce. I personally prefer standard broth. I did like my wife's spicy side to her dish though. I had grand plans of asking for extra noodles when mine ran out but I was just too full. Who would think ramen could be so filling? Overall, a good meal/experience that I would do again.   Just an FYI, keep an eye on all your additions as then can jump out at you come bill time. Little pricey if you do not stick to the basics.",

Hot steamy bowls of in-house noodles, pots of rich broth tested by time. The near endless line of regulars welcomed at door and I'm sure at times standing room only. All signs of doing ramen right.. The service this night was gracious and appreciated, we had a little guy with us. Patient and fast at the same time is rare in any restaurant. We tried three different soup bases all were very good, hot and rich. The noodles were firm and chewy, texture perfect. All were put together with some thought to the art of ramen. I can say all this because I'm Japanese, raised eating pounds of noodles and sipping broth and slurping noodles. Tampopo is legit. It would be legit in Japan and Hawaii. It being in Tempe...It's a blessing. Last words...embrace it.",

Service was polite and fast, but the first server didn't know that the noodles are made with egg (which we can't eat). Second server explained this fact so we got the Ramen WITHOUT the noodles... they didn't even think NOT to charge us full price + Charged us FULL price for the white rice we ordered INSTEAD. It was really NOT tasty so we left 2 UNTOUCHED dishes on the table. NOBODY asked why and nobody cared. NOT a place we will visit again.  total charge was $42 (3 ramen + 2 beers). pretty expensive for 2 beers + 2 untouched dishes :-( As we all were hungry we went outside and drove two miles to \"Republic Ramen\"",

The broths are very rich and adding the soft boiled egg or kimchi to your ramen is a definite must!   I did have the curry ramen on my last visit and you really should take their suggestion and have it over rice instead of noodles.  Whether it's a hot day or rainy day in AZ there's always a reason to eat ramen",

I always get the Tonkatsu ramen and add the pork belly and corn to it. They give a very good portion of meat and I really enjoy the broth. I think that their noodles are kind of thin. I like my noodles a little thicker for my ramen. Other then that I really enjoy everything else, and it's a very good size bowl. Their prices are reasonable and customer service is always good.

    "text": "I'm in Japan at least once every 120 days.  I love ramen and have tried it in a number of cities, locations, et al.  For me, Tampopo is absolutely legendary and has a highly consistent quality.  Tampopo is so good that I rarely crave ramen when I'm in Japan and would just rather stop by the shop when I'm arriving in Phoenix.  Everything about it is authentic, awesome and having eaten ramen literally around the world from Europe to Asia, Tampopo is the best.  Personally, I love the ramen in Tokyo near Kanda station at a place named \"Kikanbo\" which serves an amazing spicy miso and amazing kakuni, but if you order the spicy miso at Tampopo, hilariously, this small ramen shop in Phoenix has met and surpassed their quality and consistency.    When you go to Tokyo, hit Ichiran, go to Kikanbo and then try Tampopo, you will be amazed at the rare gem that we have here.",

I came in solo and sat down at the counter facing the kitchen to watch the huge vats of boiling broth and grilled pork belly being prepared. I ordered the tonkatsu ramen with extra green onions and broth concentrate. The first bite knocked my flip flops off! The difference was clearly in the noodles which are handmade on the premises (the noodle room). The broth was excellent and nothing went to waste. They even offer the option of having another portion of noodles to help you finish your broth but I was already in a food coma by then.  I am lucky I don't live near this gem of a restaurant as I would be hitting it up 2-3 times per week. Not only for the value, but for the taste of Japan which I last visited 12 years ago. I would love to try some of the appetizers on a future visit.",

Seeing a line right when I pulled up into the parking lot was already a good indication that this place was going to be the bomb!  The restaurant is not very big but it makes up by having a friendly staff and nice family atmosphere!   I tried several side dishes and it was all yummy! My favorite was the Takoyaki! It was cooked to perfection in my opinion. The outside was nice and crisp while the inside was so soft! The stuffing and sauce was very tasteful! Make sure you order this side dish! You will not be disappointed.   Now let's get to what you come here for and that's the Ramen! First thing first they make their own noodles so that's already a plus! The noodles were thick and had a distinct taste! I paid the extra $1 for the rich soup and that was a so worth it! The ramen was so good I ate like no one was watching! Slurp slurp!   They do serve alcohol here so don't be shy and enjoy a nice cold one while you enjoy your Ramen!   The staff was so nice and was very attentive to us! I highly recommend if you are craving for some Ramen this is the spot to go to!",

For apps, the gyoza was delicious, but this last time I ordered the Japanese fried chicken, which was ok, but kind of bland. It came with a little dish of what I think was garlic salt, which made the chicken way too salty when I dipped it. I asked the server what I was supposed to do with it, and he said he wasn't sure either... So, oh well, I just won't order it again.  The drink options are kinda slim, but sufficient. I think they could add a fountain machine and more than 1 tap beer option.  It's worth coming back for the ramen though, best I've had in AZ so far!!",

Big bowl of Ramen.  There was also a started of chicken nugget things that was incredible!  It's a small space and can get very busy so not the best place for big groups or any privacy.",

I added the thick broth. It was so rich and tasty.  This is a must.   The bonus: after eating the noodles, for 2.00, you can recharge your bowl with more noodles.  Bam!  Now I have lunch tomorrow.  By the way: I refilled with the spicy noodles.  Again, so good.  Perfect combination.  I will surely be back with more friends.  The place is small; so it would not be good for a large group.

Instead of recooking it he argued that it was blood from the marrow of the chicken bone HELLO! The meat was pink and there was blood on the bone! So since I didn't wanna argue with him I just said forget it... That really set us off for the rest of the meal... Especially since we all work in the industry so we tend to let a lot of things go but this really just pissed us off...

Noodles were very tough. No flavor, only the pork taste.   The staff was friendly and fast and this is where the stars come in.   I had chosen this place as not many places have takoyaki on the menu and my friend who has travelled and lived in Japan was craving good Japanese food. We both left very disappointed.",

My wife ordered the miso ramen and I got the tonkotsu ramen.  We ordered the chicken karage and takoyaki for the kids.  My tonkotsu ramen looked good but honestly some of the details were lacking.  The egg wasn't soft boiled, did not have the runny yoke that is traditional for Japanese ramen.  Also the ramen said chasu pork but it was a thin slice of grilled pork.  Chasu pork is a traditional soy/mirin marinated pork belly.   The pork bone broth for the tonkotsu just lacked a depth of flavor that should come from boiling those bones to release the marrow.  The noodles were the best part though as they are made in-house (always a fan of home made noodles). My wife's miso ramen was flavorful, the broth was clean and good miso taste, I personally feel miso can make up for a weaker broth.  The chicken karage and takoyaki we're home Runs for my kids who also shared our noodles.  The place is definitely worth a try, the ramen quest continues.",

Place is tiny, but they are efficient and service is top notch. If you're looking for authentic Japanese cuisine, you'll be hard pressed to find better.   Prices aren't cheap, but neither is the food, ambiance or experience. It's all really good...but I guess I just prefer a more \"basic\" offering.",

Steamed bun was overpriced as it was only 1 bun with one thin slice of pork with wayyy too much sauce. Definitely wouldn't order that again. The tonkotsu ramen was just average overall. The ramen noodle itself was really as they're freshly made at the restaurant. However, the broth was only okay, it wasn't as flavorful as I like and lacked a depth of flavor and wasn't porky enough. Also with the ramen, you only get one thin slice of pork, they should at least include 2 pieces. The soy egg was good though as the yolk was still runny and had good soy flavor. You can order additional toppings to the ramen, but I'm kind of a purist so I didn't. Phoenix is limited on ramen places and this would suffice if one had a serious craving. Also wouldn't wait more than 30mins to eat here, wouldn't be worth that long of a wait.",

    "text": "Hands down the best ramen in the valley by far. I recently just found this place after a friend introduced it to me. I've been here twice since then. I've ordered the spicy miso ramen and the curry ramen.  The spicy miso ramen is excellent. It's spicy, but doesn't over do it since I like to actually taste my food (my friend got the ultra spicy ramen, it was good, but too spicy for my taste). The broth was very rich and flavorful (without even ordering the rich broth option). The meat was cooked just right, very soft, tender, and juicy. The egg was soft boiled which I really enjoyed but that's preference.  The curry ramen is just noodles and curry stew over it, don't expect much. However this is exactly what I expected it to be since curry stew is one of my favorite go to dishes. The curry was very flavorful and as expected. I would recommend if you enjoy curry stew type dishes.  I also tried some Hirata buns, something I've not seen in Arizona. They were very tasty, soft, and flavorful. I would say they probably over do the amount of mayo they put in, but it still tasted great. The other appetizer we tried was the takowasabi (raw octopus and wasabi), this is essentially octopus and fresh wasabi in a small cup. If you're never had fresh wasabi before, you'll want to try it, it's very different from the powder/paste wasabi that's more dominant in the area. However, expect something different from the norm if you're trying this dish.  The service was okay, average. I could knock them down one star for service, but who really cares? I don't go to a restaurant for service, I go to eat good food. Nothing to complain or rave about.  To address some of the other reviews, I'm not sure what ramen places they've eaten, but this place is likely the most authentic one in the Phoenix metro area. I say this with lots of travel experience and food comparisons from all over east Asia and California ramen joints. Give it a try, you won't be disappointed if you're looking for authentic ramen, it's not the best but as good as you'll get in Arizona.",

    "text": "Went last night with my pals. Ive been a handful of time but this was the first time trying their ramen. Normally with ramen I have to stop because I get so full but I got the Seafood Ramen and Takoyaki and I ate all of it. My friends were all very very happy with what they got! I love that they put full prawns and yummy pieces of squid in the broth. It was extremely delicious.  The only down side is our checks got messed up pretty bad and had to be adjusted twice but no worries, it was pretty busy when we were there! It was easily fixed. The place is pretty small but I think gives a full, fast pace ambiance to enjoy good conversation with your friends. Totally coming back again when I crave some delicious noods.",

While I would have liked to ask for seconds I'm already fighting off the food coma so that would pretty much have been my downfall.  Friendly staff is also a huge plus.",

    "text": "I don't know if it's the ramen I got but personally I didn't enjoy it very much.  I got the spicy tonkotsu ramen added with the rich broth. It wasn't too spicy to the point where I couldn't eat it but I wasn't used to the thickness of the broth and with the spo unless, it made the broth hard to eat. I couldn't taste the \"rich\" broth but I wasn't sure if it's because the broth was spicy and it had over powered the entire ramen  The pork however was good and I want to say that in the TEMPE area, they probably made their pork the best, unless you count Fujiya Market as a ramen restaurant on Saturdays.  The noodles are also different from typical ramen noodles and I wasn't really sure what it was, but I think I would have prefer the normal ones. These are my personal preference.   HOWEVER, my friend did get the spicy miso, and he enjoyed it greatly while my cousin got the basic tonkotsu with rich broth but she didn't like either. Maybe it was the rich broth that ruined it for us.   Pricing isn't too bad but adding extra toppings can get expensive. And the service was quick. The decoration was very hip and I want to say that this place is made more for hipsters that want to try new style of food. It's good but not the best nor very traditional. Would I come back here? Yes to try other ramen.",

    "text": "First of all when the hostess seated us I asked if we can sit closer in instead of being right next to the door since there's legit 10 other seats open, she said \"sure\" rudely and didn't even look at me when she replied. Later I saw her saying something to our waitor, he ignored us and LEGIT SKIPPED US WHEN HE WAS REFILLING WATER. I was also try to get his attention to get some hot sauce I HAD TO ASK ANOTHER TABLE WAITOR CAUSE OUR IGNORED US. We got the octopus ball which is way too much batter and not enough octopus, we also ordered tonkatsu ramen with extra pork. OKAY THE PORK IS BURNED and the broth is COLD. I paid extra for rich broth which tasted so bland it look like they used FLINT, MI water for the broth, don't even waste your money. LARGE PARTY? Forget it cause the restaurant have no space. Didn't leave a tip for sure since the WAITOR DECIDED TO IGNORED US. DONT COME HERE UNLESS YOU HAVE TASTE BUDS OF STARVING NORTH KOREANS CAUSE ITS THE WORST RAMEN IVE EVER HAD AND IM ASIAN AND IVE HAD PLENTY. MOST UNAUTHENTIC ASIAN FOOD IVE EVER HAD. Wouldn't want to see a white guy makes Asian food unless he's Gordan Ramsay. How about hire some real server and not some JUSTIN BIEBER LOOKING BRAT AND FLAT CHESTED 2011 LINDSEY LOHAN. And watch they're going to put this review in the \"not recommended reviews\" to hide their bad service. IM NOT THE FIRST TO WRITE A REVIEW ABOUT BAD SERVICES, look at others reviews before trying out this place.",

As we were checking out the kitchen we both noticed the Pork Roll they use in most of the Ramen was sitting out in the open on top of the stove in a pan not even covered...  and they would just take it down to slice pieces off of it. No wonder my friend and I got sick the next morning. The Ramen ( base or broth) in a nutshell for us was bland and the noodles didn't have any real flavor, they weren't even cooked properly. Really disappointed in this place.",

    "text": "Ever been to Ramen Republic or Umani, both in Tempe? This place has it's merits for sure. Their noodles are fresh egg noodle, they have a slew of toppings for ramen bowls. They have a good choice of rice bowls with yummy protein toppings. The broth is not as good as Umani for those of  you who might be comparing, but you it's much less sodium which is a good thing. Only because my roommate wasn't drinking a gallon of water afterwards.   I ordered the pork with rice large size and added additional roasted pork on top. It was a great choice. I had a flour and diary allergy and even though I told the waiter that I couldn't have flour or diary, there was some mayo sauce on top of my pork. I skimmed it off to side because I didn't want to seem whinny and I told the waiter that I was allergic but i'll just move it to the side. He offered to remake it but I was starving as it is.   I gave this place 4 stars and not 5 because they only had one type of noodle. Normally most noodle places will have substitutes such as flour, wheat, or rice noodle for those who can not have egg like vegans. I have an allergy to egg as well so as much as I wanted to try the ramen, I couldn't.   There's always something on the menu to eat and I found it. It was delicious and my roommate enjoyed his bowl of ramen with roast pork. Just a heads up for those who can't have egg and ask before you order if you have a allergy to be safe.",

What ever Ramon bowl we chose was so gross we couldn't finish it. And we both chose different bowls. I had the popular choice and my husband got a spicy one, the kids wouldn't touch either. What ever piece of meat that was floating around in it was unrecognizable and not pretty. The plus side was the pot stickers were pretty good. And the bottled fruit soda I got was pretty good (full of chemicals and awful ingredients though). The only reason I can imagine us not liking it to the mass amount of people we see there is we normally eat organic, non-gmo, grass fed, blah blah and they were far from it. Sorry tampopo but your a no no.",
